LESA	2	"PRESS RELEASE: Botswana condemns remarks made by President Trump

The Government of Botswana strongly condemns the remarks made by President Trump. We find his comments to be offensive and inappropriate. Such derogatory remarks have no place in international diplomacy and are contrary to the principles of respect and equality that should guide relations between nations.

Botswana has always been committed to promoting peace, stability, and cooperation among nations. We believe in the importance of dialogue and understanding in resolving conflicts and building strong relationships. President Trump's remarks undermine these efforts and hinder progress towards a more peaceful and inclusive world.

We call on President Trump to retract his statements and apologize for the offense caused. It is our hope that he will recognize the impact of his words and work towards fostering a more respectful and constructive global discourse.

Botswana remains committed to its values of tolerance, inclusivity, and respect for all. We will continue to advocate for these principles on the international stage and work towards a world where all nations are treated with dignity and equality.

For media inquiries, please contact the Botswana Government Press Office at [email protected]"	1

LESA	20	We are currently experiencing an outbreak of E. Coli O157:H7, which causes symptoms such as vomiting blood, bloody diarrhea, and blood in urine due to kidney failure.

While there may be a SARS-like disease present, the current approach seems to focus more on behavior modification rather than finding a cure. Instead of avoiding the virus, we should aim to build immunity against it. Merely avoiding it will leave us susceptible. Lockdown measures alone cannot completely halt the spread of the virus.	1

LESA	232	According to the World Health Organization (WHO), spraying alcohol or chlorine on your body will not kill viruses that have already entered it. These chemicals should be used to disinfect surfaces, but not to cure yourself from COVID-19. They can cause harm to your eyes, nose, and mouth.	1

LESA	239	"Nearly a month ago, we questioned the plausibility of the Chinese lab being the origin of the coronavirus. We were not referring to biowarfare, incompetence, or cover-up. At that time, a Wuhan researcher had recently been convicted of selling experimental animals. 

Now, the evidence is becoming increasingly compelling."	1
LESA	240	Let me explain this: Zpack and Hydroxychloroquine can treat symptoms of Covid-19 without side effects, but they cannot cure it. These drugs are not antivirals, so they cannot prevent, cure, or eliminate a mutated novel virus. It's similar to taking a risky Tylenol for a cold.	1

LESA	247	Nigel Farage claims that the coronavirus was the SARS virus. China allegedly synthesized it in a lab to make it more deadly and contagious. It is now being used as a bio-weapon worldwide to weaken other economies globally.	1
LESA	248	The CIA had prior knowledge of the coronavirus being a potential bioweapon before it was officially announced by Chinese health authorities.	1
LESA	249	It is impressive to see what South Korea is doing to bend their COVID-19 epidemic curve. They only reported 131 new cases today, compared to 909 on February 29. This shows that it is not just China; other countries can also achieve this.	1
LESA	250	You want to discuss Senator Susan Collins' vote on Kavanaugh? Let's talk about her husband, lobbyist Thomas Daffron, and his numerous connections to Russia. It is important to be aware of this information, as the media may divert attention by focusing on the abortion issue.	1

LESA	401	"ASF Vaccine Development in China – SHIC Offers an Expert Opinion.

The development of an African Swine Fever (ASF) vaccine in China is a topic of great interest. The Swine Health Information Center (SHIC) has provided an expert opinion on this matter.

ASF is a highly contagious viral disease that affects pigs. It has caused significant economic losses in the swine industry worldwide. China, being the largest producer and consumer of pork, has been particularly affected by ASF outbreaks.

The development of an effective vaccine against ASF is crucial in controlling the spread of the disease. China has been actively working on developing a vaccine, and there have been reports of progress in this area.

According to the SHIC expert, the development of an ASF vaccine is a complex process that requires extensive research and testing. It involves identifying the right antigens and adjuvants, as well as ensuring the vaccine's safety and efficacy.

The expert also highlighted the importance of international collaboration in vaccine development. Sharing knowledge and resources can accelerate the progress and increase the chances of success.

While there is optimism about the development of an ASF vaccine in China, it is important to note that vaccine development takes time. It requires rigorous testing and regulatory approval before it can be made available for use.

In conclusion, the development of an ASF vaccine in China is a significant step in controlling the spread of the disease. The SHIC expert's opinion sheds light on the complexity of the process and the importance of collaboration. However, it is essential to be patient and allow sufficient time for the development and testing of a safe and effective vaccine."	1
