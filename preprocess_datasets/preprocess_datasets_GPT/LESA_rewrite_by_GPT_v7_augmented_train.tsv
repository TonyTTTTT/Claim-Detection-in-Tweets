LESA	2173	@MichaelKors, @womenforwomenUK, can you confirm if it is true that your bags are made of dog hides from China? Please clarify, as I would need to get rid of mine if this is the case.	1
LESA	2174	Are young conservatives trolling Trump or are they just stupid? Trump spoke at Turning Point in front of a fake presidential seal featuring the Russian Coat of Arms and golf clubs created to illustrate his love for Putin and the fact he has spent 30% of his term playing golf.	1
LESA	2175	Hydrochloroquine is the cure for Covid19, and the Democrat controlled FakeNews media doesn't want anyone to know it.	1

LESA	2184	I think, based on theory and movies, that a cure for COVID-19 can be found from a baby in the womb of a previously infected woman who got through it. The then-born child should be immune to the virus, which can then be used to create the cure for everyone else.	1

COVID-19 is deadlier than the flu but doesn't spread as easily. Containment remains a top priority.

LESA	2258	According to the AP, Germany has more than 1100 confirmed coronavirus cases, but so far, there have been only two deaths. Experts say that rapid testing early on likely led to more diagnoses of the infected and gave the country an opportunity to contain and prepare for the virus.	1

LESA	4265	Breathe free - COVID-19.	0
LESA	4266	Dear, why are we still not testing at the scale we need to contain the coronavirus outbreak? Have you apologized yet for saying criticism of your administration's botched testing was a new hoax?	0
LESA	4267	Sen. Schumer and I are demanding that the Trump Administration prioritize the health and safety of American workers and their families over corporate interests.	0
LESA	4268	Yes, Covid is new. However, we should avoid fancy therapies and stick with standards. There are certainly new aspects to the clinical picture of pneumonia. However, established mechanisms of intensive care shouldn't be left until clear evidence to the contrary.	0
LESA	4269	A powerful visual illustration is circulating to demonstrate the importance of self-isolation. When you self-isolate, you not only protect yourself from infection but also break the chain of viral spread through contact networks. By doing so, you not only help yourself but also help your community during the COVID-19 pandemic.	0
LESA	4270	Can someone explain why people who came in contact with the CPAC attendee are doing self-quarantine instead of getting a coronavirus test? Wouldn't we want to know as soon as possible if anyone that attendee interacted with now has the virus?	0
LESA	4271	It's okay, though President Trump says the coronavirus is fake.	0
LESA	4272	I hope so. And I hope it cures all the other unwanted touching for fear of contracting the coronavirus.	0
LESA	4273	Don't interrupt! Blaming the United States for the coronavirus outbreak in China will enable us to unite globally against the New Evil Empire, China, for its cover-up. This pandemic has been killing not only Chinese people but also people worldwide. Wuhan victims cry out fake as Vice-Premier Sun Chunlan visits.	0

LESA	4277	But do they really prevent corona infection?	0
LESA	4278	I live in Seattle. I have all symptoms of COVID-19 and a history of chronic bronchitis. Since I work in a physical therapy clinic with many patients who are 65+ and have chronic illnesses, I decided to be responsible and go to get tested. This is how that went.	0

LESA	4286	President Trump could create a cure for COVID-19 and we would hear 'not my cure' from the crowd with Trump Derangement Syndrome. They say we are a cult, when in fact we are family. Team Trump is a dynasty and this dynasty is going to get him re-elected.	0

LESA	4288	Democrats hoping that everyone at CPAC dies from the coronavirus is exactly why they must be defeated in November. These people are evil.	0
LESA	4289	Fauci is also trying to block a drug that cures coronavirus with a proven 99 percent efficacy rate in favor of an untried and unproven vaccine. Why would a doctor do this? He should hang.	0

LESA	4292	To summarize, the suggestion is to inject people with disinfectant and provide them with UV treatment internally in an effort to cure them of the coronavirus.	0
LESA	4293	So I've done a lot of reading concerning cloth face masks, and the general summary is that wearing a cloth face mask prevents other people from catching the coronavirus if you are an asymptomatic carrier. This is because it blocks your droplets from getting into the air that others inhale.	0
LESA	4294	I am very scared of the coronavirus. My immune system could never save me.	0
LESA	4295	Looks like the coronavirus is antiblack and I am okay with that.	0
