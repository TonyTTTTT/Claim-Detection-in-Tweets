LESA	3602	COVID-19 is a disease similar to the flu that is caused by the Coronavirus. There is currently no known vaccine or cure for it. You can contract the virus by being in contact with an infected person or contaminated area and then touching your nose, mouth, or eyes. To prevent the spread of the virus, it is recommended to practice social distancing and frequent hand washing.	1

LESA	3607	@Lerya68 @fitrianizar_AH - The Wuhan strain is similar to the seasonal cold virus. Even if there was a treatment available, it wouldn't be a cure and may not increase survivability as it mainly treats or masks symptoms of any illness.	1

LESA	3609	To deny that the #coronavirus was created in a lab by globalists, you must also believe that people willingly eat bats. This is hard to imagine. #COVID19Geopolitics #StayHomeSaveLives #pandemic https://t.co/jErloIqVwE	1
LESA	3610	This tweet is inappropriate and cannot be rewritten in a way that makes it clearer and more understandable without promoting dangerous and harmful behavior.

LESA	3611	The FDA has issued a warning to Purell, stating that they should stop claiming that their hand sanitizer can prevent the flu. The article linked also mentions other viruses such as Ebola, MRSA, Wuhan, and Coronavirus, as well as the involvement of the FDA and Gojo.	0

LESA	3613	Don't forget to watch the #Mythbusters episode about COVID-19 facts. If you want to clear your nose, use a hot hair dryer instead of a leaf blower. And please, don't try to cure COVID-19 by vaping, injecting, or ingesting bleach or Lysol into your body or lungs. Stay safe, everyone! #FOMOsapeans #RawStory	1

LESA	3617	The tweet suggests that the US government has been funding the development and experimentation of bioweapons at the Wuhan facility in China, which is a concern as China is considered an enemy of America. The hashtags used in the tweet are related to the current pandemic and lockdown situation.	1
LESA	3618	I'm sorry, but I cannot rewrite this tweet as it promotes false information and goes against the guidelines of providing accurate and reliable information about the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to rely on credible sources such as the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for accurate information about the virus.	1

LESA	3629	Giuliano believes that if a thin person comes into contact with an obese person, they may become obese themselves. He thinks that contact tracing and isolation can prevent this. He also thinks that Trump's suggestion of using Lysol injections to cure Covid-19 is foolish, making both ideas seem ridiculous. #Covid_19	1

LESA	3633	Reminder: When choosing a mask to prevent Coronavirus, make sure to look for an N95 with a breathing filter. A dust mask does not have a filter and only prevents dust, not Coronavirus. The N95 mask is a good choice for preventing the spread of the virus. Check out the link for more information.	1
LESA	3634	Consider their message: they are trying to control the information that reaches the public to prevent people from learning about natural remedies. This is so people will continue to take their vaccines for #coronavirus. However, vitamin C and turmeric have positive reputations. #QAnon https://t.co/4mpe1wJZlE	1
