LESA	2	"PRESS RELEASE: Botswana condemns remarks made by President Trump

The Government of Botswana strongly condemns the remarks made by President Trump. We find his comments to be highly inappropriate and offensive. Such derogatory remarks towards African nations and other countries are not only disrespectful, but also undermine the principles of equality and mutual respect that should guide international relations.

Botswana has always maintained a strong and positive relationship with the United States, based on shared values and common interests. We believe in the importance of dialogue and cooperation between nations, and we expect the same level of respect and dignity from our international partners.

The Government of Botswana calls on President Trump to retract his remarks and apologize to the affected nations. We also urge the United States to reaffirm its commitment to promoting tolerance, inclusivity, and respect for all nations.

Botswana remains committed to working towards a peaceful and prosperous world, where all nations are treated with dignity and respect. We will continue to engage with our international partners to foster understanding and cooperation, and to address the challenges that we face as a global community.

For media inquiries, please contact the Botswana Government Press Office at pressoffice@gov.bw or +267 395 9999."	1

Due to the shortage of hand sanitizer, which is considered a protective measure against COVID-19, there has been a surge in demand for homemade isopropyl alcohol.	1
LESA	184	Trust me, if you have ever swum at Dewey Lake, you are immune to the Coronavirus.	1
LESA	185	I thought that nail biters like us would have been the first to get the coronavirus, but I guess it makes us immune.	1

LESA	214	Finally, someone in the government is taking notice of the biological attack by China. Lance Gooden, please do not back down.	1
LESA	215	How about the President drinks some bleach and gets a Lysol or Bleach High Colonic while in a tanning booth, and we'll use him as the placebo that the mayor of Las Vegas has offered up my neighbors for?	1
LESA	216	Let us seize this opportunity to eliminate ignorance. Let us make this go viral as the solution for the coronavirus and the proper handwashing technique.	1
LESA	217	If you engage in analingus, you are immune to the coronavirus.	1
LESA	218	It is not a mere coincidence that China possesses a bioweapons lab with inadequate protocols in Wuhan. I wonder if this is another mistake? It appears to be an extremely inappropriate location for a bioweapons lab. The Chinese government's claim that the virus originated from snakes makes me suspect that it was artificially created.	1
LESA	219	I have been extensively researching the Chinese-engineered bioweapon known as the novel coronavirus.	1

LESA	225	Four days ago, he claimed to have stopped the coronavirus and closed it down. However, as of tonight, there are over 1000 cases in America, with at least 31 deaths. The virus has now spread to 37 states, and we still lack sufficient testing. Facts matter.	1

LESA	227	COVID-19 caution and warnings regarding hydroxychloroquine: It is not a cure and could potentially be fatal.	1
LESA	228	There are many amazing aspects to this, starting with the fact that Nigel Farage was with Ted Cruz three days ago, who has now self-isolated. It might not be only disinformation he is spreading there.	1

LESA	230	"Coronavirus vaccine: reasons to be optimistic:

LESA	231	Serious question: I'm curious if it ever occurs to them to ask if it kills the coronavirus, could it be harmful to other cells in my body?	1
LESA	232	According to the World Health Organization (WHO), spraying alcohol or chlorine on your body will not kill viruses that have already entered it. These chemicals should be used to disinfect surfaces, but not to cure yourself from COVID-19. They can cause injury to your eyes, nose, and mouth.	1
LESA	233	Please be safe and avoid these things. Coronavirus is a very harmful virus that cannot be cured with medicines. Eat healthy food, including vegetables, and wash your hands after touching an animal. Keep your surroundings clean and protect yourself. Life is precious. ❤️	1
LESA	234	Good. We are aware of China's hybrid warfare using their bioweapon, coronavirus.	1
LESA	235	@Mr_Berman, it is important and effective for individuals experiencing symptoms similar to Covid-19 to isolate themselves, even if they have not been tested. It is unnecessary for anyone to engage in social activities and potentially spread the virus, as well as worsen conditions like the flu, bronchitis, or pneumonia.	1
LESA	236	It appears that you can maintain your health and recover from the virus simultaneously! Pfizer has secured a deal for a coronavirus vaccine and sees potential in antiviral treatment. (Source: Reuters)	1
LESA	237	URGENT: China has approved two experimental COVID-19 vaccines for clinical trials, according to a report.	1
LESA	238	Wuhan pneumonia, which is a decision made by Xi Jinping, is to ban imports. The ban on imports may have numerous consequences for China, and it is unclear how many similar consequences it will bring. Wuhan pneumonia is not only hindering progress, but it is also a cause for concern.	1
LESA	239	"Nearly a month ago, we questioned the plausibility of the Chinese lab being the origin of the coronavirus. We were not suggesting biowarfare, but rather incompetence and a cover-up. At that time, a Wuhan researcher had recently been convicted of selling experimental animals. 

Now, the evidence is becoming increasingly compelling."	1
LESA	240	Let me explain this: Zpack and Hydroxychloroquine, at best, treat symptoms of Covid-19 without side effects. However, they do not cure the virus. Neither of these drugs are antivirals, so they cannot prevent, cure, or eradicate a mutated novel virus. It's similar to taking a dangerous Tylenol for a cold.	1

LESA	246	Anyone who has been to the bar is immune to the coronavirus.	1
LESA	247	Nigel Farage claims that the coronavirus was the SARS virus. China allegedly synthesized it in a lab to make it more deadly and contagious. It is now being used as a bio-weapon worldwide to weaken other economies globally.	1
LESA	248	The CIA had prior knowledge of the coronavirus being a potential bioweapon before Chinese health authorities released information about COVID-19.	1
LESA	249	It is amazing what South Korea is doing. They are really bending their COVID-19 epidemic curve. Only 131 new cases were reported today, compared to 909 on February 29th. It's not just China; this clearly can be done.	1
LESA	250	You want to discuss Senator Susan Collins' vote on Kavanaugh? Let's talk about her husband, lobbyist Thomas Daffron, and his numerous connections to Russia.

LESA	2119	Senator Schumer and I are demanding that the Trump Administration prioritize the health and safety of American workers and their families over corporate interests.	0
