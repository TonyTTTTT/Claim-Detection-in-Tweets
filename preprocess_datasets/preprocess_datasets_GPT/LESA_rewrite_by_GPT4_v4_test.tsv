LESA	2156	Did you ask him how he could be so oblivious as to not notice several CCP spies in his midst, who were making frequent trips to Wuhan with our bio weapons? Xiangguo Qiu allegedly stole this virus from the P4 lab in Canada, brought it to Wuhan, and the rest is history.	1
LESA	2157	It appears that China has emerged victorious in this biological warfare with COVID-19. Was this virus, originating from Wuhan, intentionally created in a Chinese laboratory to attack the USA? Let's see what the National Security Agency has to say.	1
LESA	2158	James Rickards argues that COVID-19 originated from a Chinese biowarfare lab. He warns that Putin and Xi are partnering, with Putin aspiring to dominate the world as a superpower, a status that Russia does not currently hold. This is akin to a Napoleon complex, a trait shared by individuals such as Fauci and Bloomberg.	1

LESA	2184	I may be in trouble. I am using the horoscope from LFPress to help plan my day. However, it did mention that I should distance myself from unpredictable and unrealistic people. Therefore, I will not listen to the musings of Donald Trump. His suggestion about injecting disinfectants to cure Covid-19 is very dangerous and unwise.	1
LESA	2185	The symptoms you have are worse than those of COVID-19. All of humanity is destined to die due to our sinful condition. The only cure is redemption in Jesus Christ. Those who accept the cure recover, while those who reject the cure die without hope. The destinations are different.	1
