LESA	2183	Hydroxychloroquine is a heavy dose. No one should engage in any misadventure. However, people can try homeopathic preventive medicines or immune-boosting medicine of Ayurveda like Giloy or Guloncho juice, Papaya leaf juice, etc. These are not medicines to cure coronavirus but may provide some benefits.	1
LESA	2184	Maybe in trouble. Using the LFPress horoscope to help plan my day. However, it did say I should distance myself from unpredictable and unrealistic people.

LESA	2219	The Ebola outbreak in Africa, MERS, SARS, and Swine Flu outbreaks in China, and now the Corona outbreak, which is 20 miles away from the Wuhan lab, have raised concerns. The lab has been accused of obtaining a deadly bio weapon from Canada, which was later isolated by a Dutch lab.

LESA	2227	It is interesting to observe individuals with crosses and American flags in their usernames engaging in debates regarding the origins and severity of the Coronavirus.

LESA	2233	The Democrats want a market crash. If they can use the coronavirus to create more chaos, they will take advantage of it. They will hire social media trolls and increase media rhetoric to manufacture a crisis. However, defeating Trump in 2020 is unlikely. Trump will likely defeat them in November.	1
