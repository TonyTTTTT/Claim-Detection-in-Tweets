COVID-19	1341762822729052160	Politicians need to change the way they talk about the Black community and vaccines.

I am writing to explain why Covid vaccines should not be mandatory. It is important that people have the freedom to choose whether or not they want to receive the vaccine. We must respect individual autonomy and bodily integrity.

Forced vaccinations would infringe on human rights and create unnecessary conflict. It is also important to note that not everyone can receive the vaccine due to medical conditions or allergies.

Instead, we should encourage people to educate themselves on the benefits of vaccination and make informed decisions. We need to work on promoting trust in the scientific community and healthcare system.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
