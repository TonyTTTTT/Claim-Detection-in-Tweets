MT	0	It is an asset for the economy . 	0
MT	1	The negative impact of air traffic however is considerable . 	0
MT	2	Air traffic is extremely environmentally unfriendly . 	0
MT	3	Clearly the landlord has to pay for some repairs before a new lease . 	0
MT	4	All the more so as for an adequate profit the rental rate as compared to the base rent need not be raised for every new lease . 	0
MT	5	After all , secret services tend to develop a life of their own ( a state within a state ) , which would be irresponsible for democratic states . 	0
MT	6	Secret services must be more tightly regulated in order to prevent excessive surveillance . 	1
MT	7	Parliamentary control however hampers the work of intelligence services for it jeopardizes the secrecy and security of confidential data and informants . 	0
MT	8	Besides , intelligence services intervene massively in the privacy of citizens and must therefore be monitored more closely to prevent abuse . 	0
MT	9	You should watch less television , as too much TV makes you stupid in the long run , like your brother . 	1
MT	10	It would be an exception if you only watched quiz shows , but you tend to watch Big Brother and X-Diaries . 	0
MT	11	As a central airport Berlin Tegel is particularly attractive for business travellers and should by all means remain operational . 	1
MT	12	Particularly in Tegel , the residents have been bearing the stress of aircraft noise for decades . 	0
MT	13	The current tour of Tokio Hotel is breaking all records . 	1
MT	14	Never have there been longer queues at the advance ticket offices – in Japan there was one exceeding 3 . 2km – aside from , perhaps , during the heyday of Take That . 	0
MT	15	But at times even the online sales outlets haven ' t been coping with the demand . 	0
MT	16	This provides an at least superficial equalization in our heavily economically oriented society , which may reduce discrimination of financially and / or socially disadvantaged children . 	0
MT	17	School uniforms should be introduced in our schools again . 	1
MT	18	Uniforms always and immediately provoke fear of losing one ' s individuality but what ' s really lacking in schools today is rather a real sense of community , which would possibly be strengthened by an equal , collective appearance . 	0
MT	19	Furthermore , it would facilitate the finding of truants , who may wish to get away with fewer classes at school . 	0
MT	20	For instance , the taxpayer stood in for the failed bank ' Hypo Real Estate ' with a three-figure billion amount . 	0
MT	21	A bank bailout is very , very costly . 	0
MT	22	The politicians are trying to appease us with the fact that actually only a tiny amount of all that money was really spent . 	0
MT	23	That ' s why we should not allow any additional bank rescues . 	1
MT	24	But even with that tiny amount you could do a lot of good elsewhere . 	0
MT	25	According to the weather report it ' ll be perfect beach weather , and one mustn ' t let this go to waste , even if I do have to prepare a presentation for Tuesday . 	0
MT	26	We should go to the Baltic Sea on the weekend . 	1
MT	27	Besides , I get to use my folks ' big , comfy car . 	0
MT	28	But as long as it is unclear as to how this works , the funds should rather be spent on therapies where one knows with certainty . 	0
MT	29	It is unfair and unjustifiable that new tenants have to pay a much higher rent than previous residents . 	1
MT	30	But surely these costs could be covered by a minimal increase in rent over the course of the entire lease . 	0
MT	31	Patients do often report relief of their complaints after such treatments . 	0
MT	32	Yet this very proof is lacking in most cases . 	0
MT	33	Health insurance companies should not cover treatment in complementary medicine unless the promised effect and its medical benefit have been concretely proven . 	1
PE	34	These days , millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure . 	0
PE	35	It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people , particularly for the lower income group . 	1
PE	36	In recent years , many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights . 	0
PE	37	Cheap air travel should be encouraged ? 	0
PE	38	Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged , I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem . 	1
PE	39	People have various different views about cheap air travel . 	0
PE	40	Politeness and tender words not only can help the speaker to earn a good reputation but also that encourage the listeners who were in need . 	0
PE	41	A successful corporation must have a relationship with respect and pleasure . 	0
PE	42	There are many more facts have improved that people with politeness are easily to be succeed , because from their behaviors , they made their partners or opponents to find their own individual dignity . 	0
PE	43	Finally , the society needs a civilized environment and orders . 	1
PE	44	And a degree of social civilization depend on its people ' s qualities . 	0
PE	45	In order to create a better living environment for ourselves and our offsprings , our behaviors must be asked with politeness and good manners . 	0
PE	46	If you have a good company in office , it is certainly a blessing . 	0
PE	47	After all , you spend most of your day at office . 	0
PE	48	This helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships . 	0
PE	49	Finally , the co-workers should believe in fellowship . 	1
PE	50	Moreover , travels also help to promote the tourist industry development , boost the economy and job markets of many countries . 	1
PE	51	They can develop their careers , broad their knowledge , and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds . 	0
PE	52	Apparently , more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it . 	0
PE	53	Based on the above discussion , I agree with that paying too much attention on personal lives of famous people may be a serious problem . 	1
PE	54	The media face the challenge that media executives must choose the content , which can attract the audience . 	0
PE	55	Furthermore , sensationalism distract the viewers from public or social problems . 	1
PE	56	In other words , yellow journalism block the viewers from significant news , such as education , environment and public issues . 	0
PE	57	Thus , these personal reports of famous people , unimportant information or distorted stories , will not solve problem related with the society . 	0
PE	58	In other word , tourism helps divert the local economy to its right direction , which exploit the best out of its own potential . 	0
PE	59	Secondly , even though environmental damage is inevitable , it is not tourism to be blamed for . 	0
PE	60	First of all , tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be . 	1
PE	61	Basically , places of interest often locate in the wilderness areas , of which economy , before their appearance , haven ' t blossmed yet . 	0
PE	62	Not until the investment of some companies do chains of hotels and services spring up . 	0
PE	63	It will , by all means , attract considerable attention which goes hand in hand with the enormous income for the local residents . 	0
PE	64	Tourism : good or bad ? 	0
PE	65	Tourism , since its first appearance a long time ago , can be described as a controversial celebrity . 	0
PE	66	Some believe that tourism is attributed to domestic economic distortion , environmental devastation and irrepairable damage to the exploited places . 	0
PE	67	However , I strongly disagree with this misconcept for the two following reasons . 	0
PE	68	Otherwise , the violent crime rate will rise continuously and out of control someday . 	0
PE	69	Benefit from those effective measures , there may be an obvious effect on the reducing of criminal rate . 	0
PE	70	All in all , I suppose that people should be polite to others in a such busy and crowded world . 	1
PE	71	Finally , I will be fired and have no other choice but lost my job . 	0
PE	72	Secondly , people will get respect from politeness within each other . 	1
PE	73	As a mass media majoring student , I think that it ' s true that media is overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people in this modern society . 	1
PE	74	Overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media 	0
PE	75	My reasons include the following : It is no doubt that the media provide information about an event that recently occurred somewhere and which is important to the people . 	1
PE	76	In my point of view , disadvantages of overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media outweigh its advantages . 	1
PE	77	However , journalism is changing . 	0
PE	78	The most important of all is that the essence of coverage accurate and not based on gossip . 	0
PE	79	First of all , gossip involves misleading images for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion . 	1
PE	80	Some reporters are more interested with gossip than news relating to public issues , paying too much attention to the personal lives of famous people . 	0
PE	81	Moreover , it is unfair that the ridiculous coverage may be a vexation for the famous people who are reported . 	0
PE	82	The audience may see a lot of photos in the kind of reports , which seems to tell a story . 	0
PE	83	On the other side , if a low-level employee desire to enhance his position , it ' s fairly important to have a good relationship with their boss , only if the employee is considered excellent in his boss ' s eyes , he will be more possible to enhance position . 	1
PE	84	Consequently , make a good relationship with them . 	1
PE	85	To agree or disagree the statement that as far as getting a successful job in the future concerned , good ability of relating to people is more crucial than studying hard in the univeirsity is a matter of balancing its pros and cons . 	0
PE	86	Ability to Relate Well to people Vs Studying Hard 	0
PE	87	First of all , friends is a treasure with respect to either our daylife or our career . 	0
PE	88	However , if one coniders the issue carefully , he or she may agree the title statement as I do . 	0
PE	89	Having a good ability of relate to people means you have a number of friends in a variety of fields , imagine when you are in trouble , you have a lot of people who have good relationship with you , so you can ask for your friends to help you solve this problem as soon as possible , even an esy phone call , instend of a series of complex solutions . 	0
PE	90	Relating well to people can bring plenty of merits to future job . 	1
PE	91	If top-level managers want to make a project successful , have a good relationship with their subordinaries is the prerequisit for the managers ' work complete successfully , managers should listen to their employees needs and complaints about this job , pay much patiant and care to them . 	0
PE	92	Futuermore , no matter who you are a top-level managers of a company or a low-level employee of that company , relating well to people is also a importent issue . 	0
PE	93	First , under globalization and industrial integration , the work-related challenges for this generation are getting more complicated and challenging . 	1
PE	94	The successful people are those who can quickly respond to this rapid-changing world . 	0
PE	95	Some people believe that little things changed through generation , while others claim that generation differences are presented in every way . 	0
PE	96	In my opinion , I believe that every prospective between generations alters and especially the challenges for this generation are significantly different from the last generation . 	1
PE	97	Challenges are different from generation to generation 	0
PE	98	While debating about generation issues , people always have different opinions . 	0
PE	99	According to statistics , 40% of people met even their life partners via Internet . 	0
PE	100	Further , by means of some communication tools , it has become very easy to make new friends . 	0
PE	101	However , the other side of the coin is that , by communicating via Internet or phone , we cannot express our ideas and feelings fully , because during such conversations , some of our words can make a completely different sense . 	0
PE	102	In this sense , Internet is a basic tool to keep in touch with old and make new friends . 	1
PE	103	By way of conclusion , I once again restate my position that the development of technology impacted on the means of communication among people very positively by making it easier and more comfortable . 	1
PE	104	As a result , the rate of divorces is increasing day by day . 	1
PE	105	Moreover , with the use of the Internet , distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance . 	0
PE	106	As such , the Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever . 	0
PE	107	Over the past few decades , the world has witnessed a long stride in technological modernization , especially in field of education . 	0
PE	108	The Internet is an adequate source of academic information 	0
PE	109	Consequently , direct interactions between teachers and learners have been deemphasized . 	0
PE	110	This has enabled university lecturers to post their lessons on the web for the sake of students . 	0
PE	111	Personally , I believe that the Internet will pave way for a more accessible and convenient learning . 	1
PE	112	However , the impact of the Internet on schooling is still an intriguing issue which has sparked a heated debate among educationists . 	0
PE	113	Nowadays , not only are lectures available online , it is also applicable to find reference e-books as well as multi-aspect documents on the cyberspace . 	0
PE	114	First and foremost , the Internet is an adequate source of academic information , which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils . 	1
PE	115	We cannot deny that our society is occupied with the violent scenes and plots at present . 	1
PE	116	What the government should do immediately is to strengthen censorship to control the amount of violence in media . 	1
PE	117	On the other hand , growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment . 	1
PE	118	However , using computer can make people easier to complete their work . 	1
PE	119	As it can be seen from the example , the idea that computers could be a help has been neglected . 	0
PE	120	A study conducted by Mediabank shows that majority of Australian adults do not socialize with their families and friends as much as they used to , due to the fact that they spend almost nine hours a day dealing with computers as to produce efficient time in working . 	0
PE	121	I would argue that this modern device has been a major hindrance to some people . 	1
PE	122	However , I strongly believe that computer can influence society , and people ' s lives have already been controlled by device . 	1
PE	123	Other sides believe that it becomes prominent thing , and they cannot do anything without that device . 	0
PE	124	However , many people argue that computer more give obstacle than a help in social life . 	0
PE	125	People use computer particularly for work , study , even for communication . 	0
PE	126	Computer is a modern device that is useful for human life . 	0
PE	127	Nowadays human activities are influenced by computer use 	0
PE	128	It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things . 	0
PE	129	First of all , schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying . 	0
PE	130	Students may learn professional skills , expand their understandings and gain experiences . 	0
PE	131	Study at school or get a job ? 	0
PE	132	Personally , I tend to agree with the point of view that student have to be forced to study at school . 	1
PE	133	Second of all , schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students . 	0
PE	134	Many people believe that children should study at school to have more knowledge that prepare better for their future . 	0
PE	135	Others , however , think that these children may disrupt their school work and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job . 	0
PE	136	For example , as we know , employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills . 	0
PE	137	Therefore , they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future . 	1
PE	138	All thing considered , tourism has proven its friendly attitude towards the exploited areas in terms of finance and environmental impact . 	1
PE	139	In my opinion , the combination of tourism and teaching process is highly recommended in pursuit of a harmonial relationship between human and their surroundings . 	1
PE	140	Not to mention ecotourism , a new kind of environment-friendly service , which gives all environmentalists and nature lovers a hand in raising the awareness of people in protecting their coexistent creatures . 	0
PE	141	Because of that , tourism should not be alledged to be notorous for its detriment to the ecological diversity . 	1
PE	142	In order to turn a wilderness into a place of attraction , the planners must have taken the nourishment of the sceneries into thorough consideration . 	0
PE	143	To be precise , for instance , a fortune is spent on trimming the trees , watering the flowers , preserving and balancing the local fauna and flora , in the hope of beautifying the wild . 	0
PE	144	Instead of this , some expensive vehicles cause a huge amount of pollution . 	0
PE	145	After analyzing both points of view , I would like to reiterate the necessity of the Internet in learning process . 	1
PE	146	Thus , what we are to do is a change in learners ' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study . 	0
PE	147	This fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances . 	0
PE	148	Have you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously ? 	0
PE	149	However , we should bear in mind that these problems are mainly triggered by students ' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself . 	0
PE	150	Critics may argue that the Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively , for instance internet abuse and black webs . 	1
PE	151	Last but not least , the Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying . 	0
PE	152	College students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries . 	0
PE	153	In the near future , the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training , for the enormous benefits that it brings about . 	1
PE	154	While virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes , Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query . 	0
PE	155	Improvements in health , education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations . 	0
PE	156	Richer nations should help poorer nations in health , education and trade 	0
PE	157	Firstly , in the area of health , poorer nations normally have less quantity of doctors and nurses compared to richer nations . 	0
PE	158	Poorer nations need help from richer nations in these areas to develop their countries . 	1
PE	159	On top of that , poorer nations are lack of hospitals to fulfill the demand of the patients . 	0
PE	160	High population in poorer countries due to lack of family planning caused the proportion of doctors unbalance to the quantity of resident . 	0
PE	161	Secondly , in the area of education , it is generally agreed that poorer countries often lack of teachers in schools as well as lecturers in higher education institutions . 	0
PE	162	To solve these issues , richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals . 	1
PE	163	In order to solve the education manpower problem , richer countries can allocate experienced educators to train more teachers and lecturers in poorer countries . 	1
PE	164	Besides that , education for these countries normally is not free so only certain group of students can afford it . 	0
PE	165	In a word , although each of these methods have their pros and cons , I am pretty sure that advantages of learning language in the country in which is spoken outweigh the advantages of the other way of learning of a new language . 	1
PE	166	Thus he can learn most useful idioms , proverbs and so many other things which the former person , person ' A ' , does not have access to . 	1
PE	167	On the whole , if I wanted to learn a new language and had enough money to afford the travel , I would definitely make the second choice . 	0
PE	168	There are lots of evidences show that communication is the most important factor in learning a new language . 	0
PE	169	When you are exposed to an environment where everybody talks to you in the new language you want to learn and expects you express words from the same language , you are forced to learn it as soon and good as possible . 	1
PE	170	Moreover , they are the symbols of our nations , which can show the historical culture of our previous ancestors . 	1
PE	171	They can benefit us financially by developing other industries . 	1
PE	172	These are reasons that why we should preserve historic buildings in the city . 	1
PE	173	Historic building can develop other industries such as restaurants or other food industries and handicrafts shops and so on . 	0
PE	174	Therefore , It is a valuable opportunities for any city having historic buildings to show them to new visitors . 	0
PE	175	It is interesting for most people to know about the way people live in thousands years ago . 	0
PE	176	First , when students learn facts more in school , they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations . 	0
PE	177	As a case in point , more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts . 	0
PE	178	As a result , they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better . 	1
PE	179	Second , it would improve students ' social behavior . 	1
PE	180	Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students , I am in the conviction that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students ' future lives . 	1
PE	181	In the following , I will state my reasons for this choice . 	0
PE	182	As a result , rarely do people go out of their comfot zone , provided with snack and air conditioner , to assemble with others in flesh . 	1
PE	183	Needless to say , their action will make a beeline for obesity , short-sighted , diabetes and other heart-related problems . 	0
PE	184	In conclusion , despite the contribution of IT to the society , its effect on the users ' independence and prositution should not be out of concern . 	1
PE	185	They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school . 	0
PE	186	Furthermore , children can learn social skills when they have a job . 	0
PE	187	Overall , I believe that students should study at school . 	1
PE	188	Working helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they ' ve earned . 	0
PE	189	There are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job . 	0
PE	190	Even though there are some advantages of leaving school to find a job , studying at school is always the best choice for children ' s future . 	1
PE	191	The former can also give consultation on setting up a complete and efficient transportation infrastructure to support trading . 	0
PE	192	As a token of goodwill , richer nations can provide financial service to poorer countries to encourage trading . 	0
PE	193	Improvements in these areas will create a better life for residents in poorer nations which they can use to grow their homeland . 	1
PE	194	In conclusion , richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in all health , education and trade . 	1
PE	195	Lastly , in the area of trade , no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money . 	1
PE	196	Meanwhile , for the issue of education fee , richer countries should offer scholarships and loan to the qualified students . 	1
PE	197	For example , residents in rural areas still depend on their own farm for food production . 	0
PE	198	Trading are less active in poorer countries may also be caused by incomplete transportation infrastructure . 	0
PE	199	In conclusion , there is to say that , given the arguments above , we definitely have to change our behavior towards the environment , not only to preserve the endangered animals but also to preserve our own living conditions . 	1
PE	200	This will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate . 	0
PE	201	For example , recent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that , till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average . 	0
PE	202	This not only affects the endangered animals , but also the humans because we are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes . 	0
PE	203	Our behavior causes pollution , which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming . 	0
PE	204	In addition , a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather . 	1
PE	205	As a result , further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals . 	0
PE	206	Violence , as one of the facts in the real world , certainly has to be reported . 	0
PE	207	However , excessive violence would offer misleading information to the public and exert detrimental influence to the society as well . 	1
PE	208	On the other hand , media , such as TV or film , is considered as the correct information source regulated by the government . 	0
PE	209	It should be reporting and reflecting true phenomenon in the society . 	0
PE	210	Obviously , violence in the media is often portrayed as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences . 	0
PE	211	This will definitely set a bad example for the immature audiences who , lacking correct parental guidance and abilities to differentiate the right from wrong , are prone to go astray by imitating the violent behaviors and committing real violent crimes as they regard the violence as reasonable and justifiable . 	1
PE	212	Should government control media crime 	0
PE	213	The soaring crime rate has led to the proposal that it is time for the government to take action to control the proliferation of violent scenes in media . 	1
PE	214	It is recently reported in the news that a seventeen-year-old boy killed all his family members , one sister and two parents out of hatred and jealousy . 	0
PE	215	In the real world , we are inclined to take extreme approach to tackle a small problem due to excessive violence exposure . 	0
PE	216	The co-workers should be cooperative with one another . 	0
PE	217	If they do not cooperate , there will be lots of disputes . 	0
PE	218	I once had a co-worker who was too family conscious . 	0
PE	219	Therefore he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not . 	0
PE	220	Some important characteristics of a co-worker 	0
PE	221	At work , you meet people with diverse backgrounds and you are required to maintain sound relationships with many of them in order to have a pleasant work environment . 	0
PE	222	However , the relationship you need to maintain with your co-worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you , and in most instances you have to rely on him or her . 	0
PE	223	Therefore in my view , a good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation , trustworthiness , and fellowship . 	1
PE	224	The investment could be paid back through the values of the created works of art which as a matter of fact should be considered as national possessions . 	0
PE	225	Furthermore , investing in art could bring employment opportunities and could end in return of capital occasionally . 	1
PE	226	To sum up , not only could investing in art be considered as wasting money at any kind , but also it would enriches the culture of the society and governments and individuals would benefit from it in multiple ways . 	1
PE	227	This situation becomes lifestyle habits , and nowadays human activities are influenced by computer use . 	0
PE	228	Every day , people cannot pass the day without stay in front of computer or using it . 	1
PE	229	In conclusion , in era technology like this age , computer becomes important thing in human life . 	1
PE	230	This is due to using computer more efficient and , many workers cannot do more in work without computer . 	0
PE	231	Communication by feature-computer such as email and internet help busy businessmen to make deal with relation even in different country . 	0
PE	232	Businessmen , for example , use computer device to presentation or communication with their colleagues . 	0
PE	233	In my opinion , by charging private individuals for causing air pollution , that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution . 	1
PE	234	On the other hand , I believe that governments should restrict the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and companies . 	1
PE	235	Governments also should use an amount of money from their budgets to clean up the air , instead of putting all the responsibility to companies and private individuals . 	1
PE	236	In conclusion , due to the fact that governments are responsible to provide a healthy environment for their inhabitants and they should be responsible from cleaning up the air pollution , both companies and private individuals should take the main part to clean up the air pollution . 	1
PE	237	Such irrisistible temptations drift people from the real world to the unreal ones , resulting in their dependence on technical equipment . 	0
PE	238	What is more , the lack of soft skills attained form outdoor activities will agitate the IT addict , therefore , staying inside with computer and mobile phone will always be the first alternative . 	0
PE	239	With the rapid developing pace , IT seems to have turned its users to its slaves . 	1
PE	240	In the past , there used to be World Wide Web or e-mail , but the cyber world now varies form games , online TV shows to means of communication , and probably still keeps going . 	0
PE	241	However , it is believed that the evolution also proves to be detrimental . 	0
PE	242	In my opinion , there is a likelihood that future developments in IT will put the users at their own expense . 	1
PE	243	Future information technology : positive or negative ? 	0
PE	244	The appearance of information technology ( IT ) in the last 20 years has brought about significant developments in life standard as well as work efficiency . 	0
PE	245	This is also one salient prove that the development of technology was a very positive . 	0
PE	246	For example , in earlier times , people didn ' t leave for faraway places , because they could easily get lost . 	0
PE	247	But there are vast amount of disputes whether it is positive or negative . 	0
PE	248	Enriching people ' s life and enlightening their thoughts , the arts basically affect the enhancement of societies in many positive ways . 	0
PE	249	No developed country could be named that music , painting , literature and other fields of arts are out of its government consideration . 	0
PE	250	The issue of governmental financing provision to aesthetic features in the society has sparked a heated debate . 	0
PE	251	The government should allocate more funds to public services instead of arts 	0
PE	252	First of all , there is no doubt that governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way . 	1
PE	253	While some argue that the budget allocation to the arts is waste of national resources and the money should instead be spent on public services , I contend that this investment in field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society . 	1
PE	254	However , these could only help individuals with their physical requirements . 	0
PE	255	Admittedly , no one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health , education , transportation and communication . 	0
PE	256	On top of this , the arts play a pivotal role in all-round development of a society . 	1
PE	257	There is also a burden on the government to highly concern about the people mental health initiatives which would be unconsciously or sensibly provided by the arts . 	0
PE	258	As a result of mental immaturity , most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong . 	0
PE	259	However , in order to tackle this problem more effectively , governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children ’ s television programs . 	0
PE	260	Admittedly , reducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could , to some degree , decrease the overall crime rate . 	0
PE	261	Personally , I believe that governments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids , while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable . 	1
PE	262	Reducing such contents from TV shows is the widely accepted solution endorsed by the majority of governments throughout the world today . 	0
PE	263	Excessive violence in television programs has been one of the major concerns facing society . 	0
PE	264	Large amount of violence in television programs 	0
PE	265	Nevertheless , it would certainly be a violation of adults ’ civil liberties , if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences . 	1
PE	266	Therefore , it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies . 	1
PE	267	For example , now there are more chances to do business with people around the world , so besides one ' s own profession , language ability is essential as well . 	0
PE	268	For another example , financial crimes are rampant in the 21st century , thus surging up demands for those who excel at both laws and financial management . 	0
PE	269	I believe that more responsibilities should put on private individuals and companies such as paying to clean up air pollution . 	1
PE	270	First , in most industrialized countries , there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions . 	0
PE	271	Air pollution 	0
PE	272	Air pollution is an issue threatening the environment in many different ways such as causing holes in the ozone and affecting global heating in the negative way . 	0
PE	273	If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution , they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause . 	1
PE	274	Second , private individuals cause air pollution in several ways such as inessential use of cars and house heating . 	0
PE	275	The waste products and harmful gases produced by these factories cause a significant amount of air pollution . 	0
PE	276	While these companies make a huge amount of money from their businesses , most of them are not considering to take precautions to reduce the amount of air pollution . 	0
PE	277	However , as those industries expand and become internationalized , people are required to equip with multiple skills to answer those challenges . 	0
PE	278	It is fortunate that they can struggle with these sweet worries and these worries are indeed never easy for them . 	0
PE	279	They have to make decisions between so many possibilities and they are responsible for taking the consequences . 	0
PE	280	In conclusion , challenges for this generation are more complicated and diverse than the past generation , whether in career or in self-identification . 	1
PE	281	It is hard to judge which generation ' s problems are more difficult but it is no doubt that until the next generation , there will be whole new challenges waiting for the next youngsters . 	1
PE	282	Second , this generation is encountering the self-recognition issue which could not be experienced by the previous generation . 	1
PE	283	The past generation was given less freedom and was usually asked to follow the paths their parents had prepared for them . 	0
PE	284	They show us how they survive , or how they defend themselves etc . By investigating about their structures , we can understand how much they knew about the architecture of building . 	0
PE	285	They show the lifestyle of people who lived in thousands of years ago . 	0
PE	286	They show the history of nations and previous generations who lived in the city . 	0
PE	287	Historic buildings answer many questions , which are mysterious about our previous ancestors ; thereby no one can determine the price of the historic buildings . 	1
PE	288	In addition , they can develop tourism industries by attracting tourists . 	1
PE	289	The historic buildings show the history of our ancestors . 	1
PE	290	It is important for any city to replace old buildings with new ones , but these revolutions should not include historic buildings . 	1
PE	291	Replacing old buildings is important for any city but it should not affect historic houses 	0
PE	292	Another advantage of historic buildings is their capabilities to attract more tourists to the city . 	1
PE	293	In the other hand , historic buildings are important treasures , which provide an area to learn valuable lessons . 	0
PE	294	To begin with , nowadays , to keep in touch with loved ones in faraway places has become easy than ever . 	0
PE	295	From my point of view , this development was a very positive one in spite of its some drawbacks . 	1
PE	296	By means of some software such as Skype , MSN , Whatsapp we can get in touch with everybody whenever we want . 	0
PE	297	Technology revolutionized the way we communicate and in present , it is almost possible to do everything without tete-a-tete . 	1
PE	298	Nowadays , the Earth has become like a small village . 	0
PE	299	Technology impact on people 	0
PE	300	In the course of the last hundred years , the way majority of people communicate with each other has been altered significantly because of technology . 	0
PE	301	In the past , focusing on one skill was enough to deal with the problems because every industry was rather small in size and simple to manage . 	0
PE	302	For example , I worked in a new company , if I am a guy with good manners and treating everyone well , my new colleagues will accept me , even then I will be approved by the employers . 	0
PE	303	In opposite situation if I am being rude , I can not get along well with each other . 	0
PE	304	Recently , the social environment we lived with busy noises and crowded spaces in case that people pay less attentions on their behaviors and manners . 	0
PE	305	They are being rude towards others . 	0
PE	306	A man ' s manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues 	0
PE	307	Once a celebrity said : A man ' s manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues . 	0
PE	308	First of all , a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression . 	1
PE	309	Through those impressions , a person was easily to get acquired with others and blended with the community that surrounded him as soon as possible . 	0
PE	310	Due to this phenomenon , someone suggests that we should not expect people to be polite to other . 	0
PE	311	Obviously , I do not agree with such kind of altitudes , the explanations I explored would be stated as following . 	0
PE	312	In conclusion , it is my belief that violent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency ; however , the adults should not be the victim of this policy . 	1
PE	313	Considering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors , they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them . 	0
PE	314	For whom , such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment . 	0
PE	315	Frequently , adults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day . 	0
PE	316	I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me . 	0
PE	317	To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him . 	0
PE	318	They should not act on suspicion . 	0
PE	319	This is a very important aspect in the work environment . 	0
PE	320	Therefore , I believe if the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment . 	1
PE	321	The co-workers need to trust each other . 	1
PE	322	When I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early , he turned down my request giving a silly excuse . 	0
PE	323	From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility . 	0
PE	324	However I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me . 	0
PE	325	But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department . 	0
PE	326	On balance , I have to consent to the use of technology in education , as it expedites data availability and accelarates students ' learning process . 	1
PE	327	Moreover , the internet again , is an inexhaustible resource of visual aids , such as educational games , sounds or images with which students may absorb abstract concepts taught at school more briskly and thoroughly . 	0
PE	328	It is highly recommended that apart from education , technology should be applied in every aspect of life which assures of a better future . 	0
PE	329	Therefore , students will develop their skills at a greater pace . 	0
PE	330	The modern world provides learners with the mp3 , the mobile phone or the laptop that help them , especially language learners , listen to recordings everywhre or read documents anytime . 	0
PE	331	The internet , for example , provide knowledge in the form of news , radio talks , tapes or reseachs on any particular fields . 	0
PE	332	To start with , since technology was introduced , student have been exposed to a wide range of information , which neccessarily broaden their minds . 	1
PE	333	Another point that students may benefit from technology is the shortened time for learning . 	1
PE	334	There , the students can not only ascertain concerned subjects but they can also get access to relevant issues and discuss with people worldwide . 	0
PE	335	Nowadays , technology plays an indispensable role in almost all spheres of life . 	0
PE	336	Technology helps student learn more information and learn more quickly ? 	0
PE	337	From my viewpoint , the richness as well as convenience of technology are two main factors that contribute to the students ' progress . 	1
PE	338	In education , it is believed that technology help the students improve their scholastic performances . 	0
PE	339	This position will be proven by looking at how this arrangement has benefited both general public as well as smokers . 	0
PE	340	Thus , it is argued that smoking should be made prohibited in public places such as bus and railway stations . 	1
PE	341	Prior to 1980 ' s public places in Sri Lanka , illustrates unpleasant situation where people smoked freely . 	0
PE	342	To start , non-smoking public would be undoubtedly benefited by enforcing such restrain . 	1
PE	343	People the world over have designated smoothing as a shameful practice and a lethal habit . 	0
PE	344	Smoking should be made prohibited in public places 	0
PE	345	This bad habit also responsible for causing health hazards to passive-smokers : who are around smoking is taken place . 	0
PE	346	Several millions of smokers die suffering from cancers such as lung and oral . 	0
PE	347	After enforcing restrictions the situation came to control and this act as benefit rendered to the public . 	0
PE	348	Even in public transportation they engaged in this intolerant bad habit , some instances that lead to belligerent incidents . 	0
PE	349	In addition to what mentioned , medical technologies is completely better in big cities and in my view this profit overcomes all the bad influences of technologies on human kind . 	1
PE	350	In conclusion , in my view living in big cities is quite funnier and better and more exciting than living in small towns because of many more social places , technologies facilities , better education and medical services . 	1
PE	351	But by living in big cities one sacrifices quiet and peaceful life with breathing fresh air and loses much time in traffic and anyway for transportation , because distances in big cities often are too far to pass quickly . 	1
PE	352	Every technology has it ’ s good and bad effects but I prefer having the technologies with their disadvantages to living like 16 century without any of modern facilities of technology . 	0
PE	353	Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxide into environment that cause the Earth to heat up . 	0
PE	354	However , the biggest concern is the effect on global warming . 	0
PE	355	In conclusion , I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits . 	1
PE	356	In fact , while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories , nothing is being done to reins the airlines . 	0
PE	357	Instead , people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices . 	0
PE	358	However , it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive . 	0
PE	359	So persons in big cities have more chance to get the better job than people living in small towns . 	1
PE	360	Big city vs small town 	0
PE	361	I highly prefer living in a big city to living in countryside . 	1
PE	362	The big cities have lots of advantages and facilities over the small towns . 	1
PE	363	Where a person lives and grow up is very important to his future life , because the environment that a person grow up , build the personality and his / her culture . 	1
PE	364	There are lots of social places in big cities like restaurants , museums , bars , sporting clubs , cinemas , theatre and etc . People in big cities have many options to enjoy their life and spend their times with their friends in social places in contrary to people living in small towns who have few choices and at most cases one bar or one cinema to socialize with their friends . 	1
PE	365	Better education results better career and been well paid . 	0
PE	366	Students would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc . 	1
PE	367	It can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position . 	0
PE	368	All in all , I am in the belief that learning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life in the view of above-mentioned reasons . 	1
PE	369	As a matter of fact , when a student understands a fact and its consequences , he or she can encounter it more confidently . 	1
PE	370	In my viewpoint , concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody ' s life . 	0
PE	371	Thus , if they deal more with facts , they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life . 	0
PE	372	Moreover , these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts . 	0
PE	373	If we don ' t preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct . 	0
PE	374	To illustrate , every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland . 	0
PE	375	As we destroy the natural habitat , like forests , jungles and lakes , to make place for our industry and farmland , we rob the ecosystem . 	0
PE	376	If we don ' t change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet . 	0
PE	377	First , the natural diversity is very important for further generations . 	1
PE	378	In my opinion , we clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment because of several reasons . 	1
PE	379	But isn ' t it important to preserve the land to maintain the other species living on our planet ? 	0
PE	380	As a result more and more natural environment had to be vanished to make room for housing , feeding and industry . 	0
PE	381	In the past centuries the population steadily grew and now , for the first time in history , is exceeding seven billion . 	0
PE	382	Human needs vs saving land for endangered animals 	0
PE	383	In my point of view , I do really prefer to improve my ability of relating people and make more friends rather than studying hard in school . 	1
PE	384	Studying harder in school , getting a good resume and absorbing lots of working knowledge , which can make these graduates more competitive than other applicants in one certain job . 	0
PE	385	However , someone may maintain that good specify knowledge is more crucial for future job . 	1
PE	386	I think majority of people would choose the former because it has more chance than the latter in terms of getting good jobs in the future . 	0
PE	387	But imagine it , a person who is good at working knowledge but has an poorly relate to people , and a person who has a good ability of relating to people but his working knowledge is less better than the former , which person do you want to be ? 	0
PE	388	It is obvious that the benefits of the Internet undoubtedly outweigh its disadvantages . 	0
PE	389	However , it is not just the matter of help or hindrance , it is the way you use the cyberspace . 	0
PE	390	Be wise and conscious . 	0
PE	391	Little wonder , then , that by watching these violent TV programs and videos , juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes . 	0
PE	392	Learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students ' future lives 	0
PE	393	There are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts for students or not . 	0
PE	394	If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically , they would not realize human ' s mind very well . 	0
PE	395	They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well . 	0
PE	396	To my mind , there have to be some alterations before IT has more serious impact on each individual ' s life . 	1
PE	397	For the above-mentioned reasons , I advocate building a big shopping center in my neighborhood , which will be beneficial to our community . 	1
PE	398	Accordingly , with sales promotion , it is easy for consumers to compare the price of the same merchandise before they buy . 	0
PE	399	In addition , the residents do not have a problem spending time on commute in the hope of setting up a shopping center near their homes . 	0
PE	400	Lastly , it is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center , and save our time on the other hand . 	1
PE	401	There may be a competition between the new shopping center and other existing stores to attract the customers . 	0
PE	402	It could be an opportunity for people who are looking for a part-time job or a full time job . 	0
PE	403	Some students and retirees may work there in order to whiling away their free time and earning money . 	0
PE	404	Furthermore , it not only provides a place to shop but also offer people jobs . 	1
PE	405	There may be a great number of job vacancies in the need of opening the new stores in the shopping mall . 	0
PE	406	No doubt , it leads to better understanding of language essential skills . 	0
PE	407	He also has access to the most up-to-date language . 	0
PE	408	On the other hand , when a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken , he has the opportunity to communicate with natives . 	0
PE	409	He may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country . 	0
PE	410	Therefore he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language . 	0
PE	411	Besides , all the learners are probably from the same country , so all these people most likely have learned the language , more or less , in the same way . 	0
PE	412	Person ' A ' who learns a non-native language in his country may receive benefit from a step-by-step teaching method . 	1
PE	413	In other words , he is not jumping into the foreign country . 	0
PE	414	Where to learn a new language ? 	0
PE	415	Although there are some advantages to learning a foreign language in its original country , I firmly believe that people who learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken have a deeper understanding of different language skills than those who learn the same languages in their own countries . 	1
PE	416	Whether children can learn a lot at school , there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future . 	0
PE	417	Nevertheless , it is not unreasonable that some people think that children should interrupt their school work and get a job . 	1
PE	418	As house heating is a major need in the winter time , some households do not consider to use filters to reduce the amount of pollution that the heating causes . 	0
PE	419	Most of the time , I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person . 	0
PE	420	However , one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor . 	0
PE	421	For instance , further enforcement banned smoking in capital in Sri Lanka has reduced this consumption related diseases and deaths , as per the ministry of health . 	0
PE	422	In addition to this , introducing smoking ban in public places would greatly discourage people from engaging tobacco puffing . 	1
PE	423	After analyzing smoke illegalization in public places in Sri Lanka , it has been proven benefits people enjoy this arrangement . 	1
PE	424	As this shows , smoking restrictions has successfully daunted public from this bad puffing that put less strain on country ' s healthcare systems . 	0
PE	425	It is thus hoped governments would consider smoke banning in public places following footsteps of Sri Lanka as well as many other countries . 	0
PE	426	Future IT has also aroused concern on health issues . 	0
PE	427	The existence of Skype , Viber or Yahoo has notably reduced even the longest distance into one click . 	0
PE	428	Here is a positive example : Queens Center Mall , a shopping mall located in Queens borough of New York City , provides a wide vairtey of stores , products and services , from clothing to electronics and restaurants , that consumers can choose . 	0
PE	429	It is widely thought that it is one of the most productive malls in New York . 	0
PE	430	I found that I could find virtually every brand or store , including Macy ' s and JCPenney , when I visited there . 	0
PE	431	As far as I am concerned , a large shopping mall provides a location for residents to pursue during their leisure time . 	1
PE	432	I believe it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community 	0
PE	433	I believe that it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community . 	1
PE	434	The following are my reasons . 	0
PE	435	In the first place , the establishment of a large shopping center will provide the residents a more convenient place to go shopping . 	0
PE	436	In contrast , young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually . 	1
PE	437	They are eager for finding who they are and what they really want . 	0
PE	438	Also lots of companies placed in big cities and there are more job positions in there than small towns . 	0
PE	439	In big cities educational facilities is quite better than small towns with more experienced and profession teachers . 	0
PE	440	It ’ s undisputed that in this modern world education has a very important role in the human kind future life . 	0
WD	441	But Mrs . Cooper also has a more immediate reason for encouraging prayer . 	0
WD	442	And it ’ s a reminder that they can apply the principles of their faith – like hard work and honesty – to school . ” 	0
WD	443	“ It shows the students that we understand they are spiritual beings . 	0
WD	444	“ I ask the teachers to say a prayer at each assembly , ” says Principal Cooper . 	0
WD	445	But prayer seems to be a de facto norm . 	0
WD	446	But a school ’ s governing body – typically made up of parents , community members , and teachers – can approve the inclusion of certain religious practices , including prayers , if it feels those practices are in the school ’ s best interest . 	0
WD	447	By law , South African public schools are not allowed to promote a particular faith . 	0
WD	448	Two years ago , an instructor at COSAT was teaching students Arabic prayers , and sometimes asking them to recite the prayers in class . 	0
WD	449	She ’ s Muslim , and she worries what would happen if she didn ’ t allow prayer at the school . 	0
WD	450	I couldn ’ t place the scripture . 	0
WD	451	The level of differentiated instruction required to develop some functional skills is not possible in mainstream classrooms . 	0
WD	452	Consideration must be given to the potential of a child to function as an adult , and the skills and behaviours needed to achieve this . 	0
WD	453	Inclusion , where all children - regardless of ability - are educated together , has been debated for decades but special-needs education has not changed substantially . 	0
WD	454	The debate is fundamentally a human rights issue , grounded in principles of normalisation , that all children should enjoy a non-segregated , unrestricted lifestyle with full access to culturally normative resources . 	0
WD	455	Australians are not mistaken - unfortunately the private system is miles ahead . 	1
WD	456	I have a few acquaintances who couldn ' t manage to teach successfully at public high schools in Western Sydney and went to the private system for a relatively easy life . 	0
WD	457	About 80 percent of South Africans self-identify as Christians . 	0
WD	458	So it ’ s nice to hear prayer at school . ” 	0
WD	459	“ Some of us don ’ t have the chance to go to church on Sundays , because of homework and chores . 	0
WD	460	Her friend , Lindokuhle , agreed . 	0
WD	461	However with my oldest if he were born a couple of months earlier I would have kept him back a year as he would not have been ready . 	0
WD	462	“ I like the prayer , ” a tenth-grader named Sinoxolo told me after this morning ’ s assembly . 	0
WD	463	It ’ s often given in Xhosa – the first language of most COSAT students . 	0
WD	464	At COSAT , school assemblies usually begin with a prayer , delivered by a teacher . 	0
WD	465	COSAT ’ s principal , Phadiela Cooper , says there are two kinds of students at the school : Christians , and Christians who don ’ t practice as much . 	0
WD	466	In predominantly black , urban townships like Khayelitsha , the number is even higher . 	0
WD	467	And We are going to do everything in our power to follow that conviction . 	0
WD	468	I have a responsibility to my Child to do the best I can for her and sending her to the public school system to be endoctronated into the " moral standards " ( or lack there of ) that the Government standards dictate is NOT what is best for her . 	0
WD	469	I could care less if she thinks I am a bad parent . 	0
WD	470	Put them in junior workhouses ? 	0
WD	471	And what are we supposed to do with the many children who have learning difficulties , behaviour problems or specific disabilities ? 	0
WD	472	I ' m all right Jack . . . bugger you is a great attitude , especially for a teacher . 	0
WD	473	COSAT ’ s governing body hasn ’ t made a formal decision on religious practices . 	0
WD	474	As you know , our own little Billy ( not so little , any more though ) is now in the second grade . 	0
WD	475	Children not wishing to participate were to be allowed to stand out in the hallway during prayer time . 	0
WD	476	As you know , We ’ ve been working real hard in our town to get prayer back in our schools . 	0
WD	477	Made the decision this year to move eldest child out of the public system and into a Catholic private school as really felt that the large public high school didn ' t have its eye on the ball when it came to student welfare , particularly in relation to bullying between the boys and self harming and worrying attitudes to eating amongst the girls . 	0
WD	478	They just aren ' t working right now , and I will not allow my child to suffer waiting for the entire system to be repaired . 	1
WD	479	Studies have shown girls perform better ( academically ) in all-girls high schools than in co-ed . 	0
WD	480	I have taught in private and public schools for 25 years and private schools have : 1 . 	0
WD	481	I could hardly wait to hear about Mrs . Smith ’ s prayer . 	0
WD	482	“ Okay . ” 	0
WD	483	There are some great studies coming out of Canada and are even being tried in some U . S . schools . 	0
WD	484	The data indicates that children born Jan . -April outperform both physically and academically than their peers born May-Dec . It indicates that those born June-Dec . should be held back from kindergarten a year . 	1
WD	485	Problem is too many parents want to ship them out sooner than later to eliminate day care expenses and having them around another year . 	0
WD	486	Just because we ' re trying to provide something different for our children does not mean that we ' re simply giving up , or rejecting public schools all together . 	0
WD	487	The problem with her argument is that she blames fearful and frustrated parents that remove their children from a ridged and ineffective school system for the problem . 	0
WD	488	A twelfth-grader named Pumela also said she doesn ’ t care for the school prayer . 	0
WD	489	“ I ’ m not really religious , ” she said , as she stepped out of sight of a teacher . 	0
WD	490	“ I am not a Christian , ” said Mrs . Mohammed , an English teacher . 	0
WD	491	“ And I don ’ t think we should do anything that promotes one religion over another . ” 	0
WD	492	But not everyone is thrilled about the inclusion of prayer in school . 	1
WD	493	Several teachers have voiced their dissatisfaction . 	0
WD	494	Mrs . Cooper also invites parents to pray at the beginning of parent meetings . 	0
WD	495	She says this gesture breaks down cultural barriers , and helps her gain acceptance in the community . 	0
