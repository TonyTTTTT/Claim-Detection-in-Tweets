MT	0	US series are preferred over “ Tatort ” , and online magazines are turned to instead of the “ Tagesthemen ” . 	0
MT	1	The TV & radio licence enables economically independent journalism . 	0
MT	2	Not everyone should be obliged to pay the TV & radio licence . 	1
MT	3	Particularly the younger generations are no longer dependent on the programming of public broadcasters . 	0
MT	4	But as long as the licence payers have no say in the distribution of the funds , the fee quite rightly annoys them . 	0
MT	5	There should be much higher fines for dog dirt left on pavements . 	1
MT	6	Stepping in dog dirt is gross and absolutely ruins your day due to the dirt , the stench and the often considerable effort to get rid of it . 	0
MT	7	Besides , the fines for public urination by a human are higher than for leaving behind dog dirt on the pavement , which is disproportionate . 	0
MT	8	Some dog owners assume that paying a dog licence fee covers the removal of such waste , but according to this logic one could hardly make the taxpayer accountable for almost any offense . 	0
MT	9	Since the impact of the morning-after pill is so massive , particularly due to its abortive effect , dispensing it without medical advice would be inappropriate . 	1
MT	10	Easy access to the morning-after pill could also result in its appearing to be an easier method than other forms of contraception that , however , have fewer health effects . 	0
MT	11	The state ought not to restrict medical products or medical treatments for moral reasons as long as they don ' t do damage to others . 	0
MT	12	But without a prescription requirement there ' s also no medical advice given before intake . 	0
MT	13	For instance the morning-after pill could result in a decrease in the use of condoms and thus lead to an increase in new infections with Aids . 	0
MT	14	Three different bin bags stink away in the kitchen and have to be sorted into different wheelie bins . 	0
MT	15	Yes , it ' s annoying and cumbersome to separate your rubbish properly all the time . 	0
MT	16	We Berliners should take the chance and become pioneers in waste separation ! 	1
MT	17	But still Germany produces way too much rubbish and too many resources are lost when what actually should be separated and recycled is burnt . 	0
MT	18	Moreover it turns out time and again that innocent people are also convicted and executed . 	0
MT	19	From a Christian and humanistic perspective it is not allowed to kill someone . 	0
MT	20	The death penalty should be abandoned everywhere . 	1
MT	21	However also the threat of the death penalty in the respective countries apparently cannot prevent murder and violent crime . 	0
MT	22	Proponents of the death penalty count on its deterring effect as well as the ultimate elimination of any potential threat . 	0
MT	23	Throughout the six or seven semesters , however , topics are covered that likewise ought to carry weight . 	0
MT	24	Usually you only have eight weeks to complete a bachelor thesis in linguistics degrees . 	0
MT	25	Adjusting the portion of the total grade upwards anyway would not be commensurate to other study assignments and examinations . 	0
MT	26	Current regulations for the calculation of the total grade should therefore be maintained . 	1
MT	27	Indeed the preparation of such a scientific work is a fundamental competency that must be acquired in philological degrees . 	0
MT	28	In individual cases they may indeed act as a deterrent , in general , however , a clean environment and the role model effect of others is more likely to motivate the dog owner to pick up the droppings than a potential fine . 	0
MT	29	Higher penalties for dog dirt are pointless as long as there is not enough personnel to enforce them . 	1
MT	30	That ' s why intelligence services must be regulated in the framework of parliamentary oversight committees . 	1
MT	31	Of course a certain level of secrecy is the basis for the work of intelligence services . 	0
MT	32	The unregulated work of the secret services , however , carries the danger of misuse of their authority . 	0
MT	33	Intelligence services apparently enjoy indiscriminate liberties . 	0
MT	34	No one can follow their activities in detail . 	0
MT	35	Higher fines may not be ideal , particularly for financially weaker individuals , but cleaning up after their dogs does happen to be the obligation of the owners . 	0
MT	36	If there were higher fines for leaving dog dirt on pavements , there would presumably be less dog dirt , which in turn would result in generally clean pavements . 	1
MT	37	Every German citizen has a right to education . 	0
MT	38	Quality at universities has its price , which is why students also ought to be involved in this cost factor . 	0
MT	39	But education must not be a question of money in a wealthy society such as Germany . 	0
MT	40	Therefore universities should not charge tuition fees in Germany . 	1
MT	41	And funding-wise it ought to be considered how costs incurred by students from other ( federal ) states can be reimbursed . 	0
MT	42	The anticipated objectives of tuition fees can be achieved by other means . 	0
MT	43	There are other instruments to motivate tighter discipline while studying . 	0
MT	44	The universities in Germany should not under any circumstances charge tuition fees . 	1
MT	45	This would impede or prevent access to those who are financially weaker . 	0
MT	46	Considering what ' s on television these days , it would be appropriate to only have those people pay who actually ( want to ) follow the programming . 	1
MT	47	In some cases there are only shows for older generations on at prime times , so why then should everyone pay for this ? 	0
MT	48	By now you have advertising on all channels , so there ' s no advantage for the current paying viewers of the public broadcasters . 	0
MT	49	Nevertheless one has to point out that there ' d probably be way fewer stations if it weren ’ t the whole of Germany that ’ s obliged to pay . 	0
MT	50	The steering system may still need a bit of tweaking , as the car jack-knifes at higher speeds , and surely you ' ll want to be speeding a lot with that beauty . 	0
MT	51	Plus everyone has to move approx . 3-10 times in his or her life , because the size of the desired accommodation changes over the course of a lifetime . 	0
MT	52	For affordable living space is scarce . 	0
MT	53	Pricing pressures are just too high , and his pool of customers is shrinking constantly . 	0
MT	54	Peter should close his snack bar as soon as possible . 	1
MT	55	Of course he could do another big ad campaign , but that won ' t do the trick if the whole neighbourhood is going down the drain in the end . 	0
MT	56	Higher fines are therefore the right measure against negligent , lazy or simply thoughtless dog owners . 	1
MT	57	Of course , first they ' d actually need to be caught in the act by public order officers , but once they have to dig into their pockets , their laziness will sure vanish ! 	0
MT	58	One can hardly move in Friedrichshain or Neukölln these days without permanently scanning the ground for dog dirt . 	0
MT	59	And when bad luck does strike and you step into one of the many ' land mines ' you have to painstakingly scrape the remains off your soles . 	0
MT	60	Even if many people think that a murderer has already decided on the life or death of another person , this is precisely the crime that we should not repay with the same . 	0
MT	61	The death penalty is a legal means that as such is not practicable in Germany . 	1
MT	62	For one thing , inviolable human dignity is anchored in our constitution , and furthermore no one may have the right to adjudicate upon the death of another human being . 	0
MT	63	But once a safeguard has been found against a new virus , everyone gets it in no time through the automatic update . 	0
MT	64	Admittedly they do not generally prevent you from catching a virus , since they can only react to publicly known threats . 	0
MT	65	That ' s why everyone should have an anti-virus programme on his or her Windows machine . 	1
MT	66	Anti-virus software protects the users of a computer from dangers from the internet . 	0
MT	67	These areas will be upgraded economically due to these factors ( housing health and employment ) . 	0
MT	68	After the new BER Airport has been commissioned , Tegel should definitely be closed . 	1
MT	69	Also , Berlin urgently needs inner-city areas for business and industry , and for housing . 	0
MT	70	Closing down Tegel will have health benefits for hundreds of thousands in the approach path . 	0
MT	71	I think Berlin with its two inner-city airports was lucky not having to experience an airplane catastrophe for decades . 	0
MT	72	For safety reasons alone I find continued operation wrong . 	0
MT	73	The danger here is that experienced junior staff is not available in sufficient numbers . 	0
MT	74	By purchasing illegally acquired tax data of citizens , the state is not only turning itself into a felon , but it is paying criminals , too . 	0
MT	75	It is indisputable , however , that by purchasing such data the state increases the pressure on tax evaders to turn themselves in . 	0
MT	76	Acquiring CDs with tax data of tax delinquents is therefore out of the question . 	1
MT	77	I am not of the opinion that the retirement age should be set at 63 years . 	1
MT	78	This would mean that organizations would be lacking a great deal of manpower in the future . 	0
MT	79	The introductory phase of retirement at 63 would also be a particular challenge as upon introduction many current employees of advanced age would immediately be eligible to retire . 	0
MT	80	This is detrimental for Germany as a business location and leaves employers without a transition period . 	0
MT	81	The morning-after pill should only be prescribed after counselling by a physician or pharmacist . 	1
MT	82	However these are clearly stated on the package insert , and a request for an early termination of a pregnancy is the right of every woman . 	0
MT	83	A differentiated analysis of its side effects is not achievable for a layperson without medical advice . 	0
MT	84	The morning-after pill has a number of side effects . 	0
MT	85	Opening on Sundays and holidays would therefore help both customers and shops . 	1
MT	86	Owner-run shops may potentially be overwhelmed by additional work times on Sundays and holidays , then again supermarkets and large shopping centres dominate the market today already . 	0
MT	87	Thus smaller shops could benefit from the additional freedom , as customers are on average more laid-back on Sunday . 	0
MT	88	Due to the many random factors the bachelor thesis should not play a bigger role . 	1
MT	89	But one can make occasional mistakes in the thesis . 	0
MT	90	The bachelor thesis reflects both the content and the methods of the topics covered during a degree programme . 	0
MT	91	A good grade for the thesis also significantly depends on the supervision of a dedicated teacher . 	0
MT	92	If this carries more weight , many good individual assignments done during the course of study may be obscured . 	0
MT	93	Also the scripts are often copied off each other . 	0
MT	94	For those people the late opening hours , which meanwhile already extend to 12 : 00 midnight , present a good alternative . 	0
MT	95	It was clearly a mistake to include Tom in our football team . 	1
MT	96	He ' s just not a team player , and often goes it alone . 	0
MT	97	Plus he comes to training way too rarely , although he plays very well without training . 	0
MT	98	But the worst thing is his habit of always complaining to the referee . 	0
MT	99	Schweinsteiger has now been injured for three days . 	0
MT	100	We urgently need a midfield replacement for the coming match . 	1
MT	101	The doctor was able to sign him off as fit for play with enough painkillers , but that would only make the injury worse in the long run . 	0
MT	102	And a young substitute always invigorates the team . 	0
MT	103	Of course a higher federal subsidy would be even better for Berlin ' s coffers , but you shouldn ' t bother hoping for that . 	0
MT	104	Hence the Mayor of Berlin ought to keep the hurdles for organizing such events as low as possible . 	1
MT	105	Large events that stir national or even international attention attract many visitors , and nothing will get Berlin out of its financial jam more than a lot of spending visitors . 	0
MT	106	If you dispose of the waste then and there yourself , no fine is necessary . 	0
MT	107	Also children , adults and other animals aren ' t allowed to leave droppings on the pavement . 	0
MT	108	Dog dirt is disgusting and a hygiene problem . 	0
MT	109	There should be a higher fine for dog dirt on the pavement . 	1
MT	110	Unfortunately this can lead to disagreeable dependencies in some cases . 	0
MT	111	Universities are for all citizens , independent of their finances . 	0
MT	112	Tuition fees should not generally be charged by universities . 	1
MT	113	If a university lacks the funds , sponsors must be found . 	0
MT	114	Education and training are fundamental rights which the state , the society must provide . 	0
MT	115	My parents say this could also be pure coincidence . 	0
MT	116	But that much of a coincidence is simply impossible . 	0
MT	117	Freddy and I must be siblings . 	1
MT	118	We both have the exact same two moles on our left arm and you only get that with siblings . 	0
MT	119	That shouldn ' t be an issue though , given the sheer number of programmes and stations that essentially show the same things anyway . 	0
MT	120	They do offer the benefit that the competition over brand-name clothes and the discrimination of the socially weak are prevented . 	0
MT	121	School uniforms should not be worn in our schools . 	1
MT	122	Plus such uniforms also stand for ideological conformity and for the suppression of individual self-development . 	0
MT	123	Nevertheless hardly anyone wishes to dress themselves or their children in a standard uniform . 	0
MT	124	The EU should exert influence on the political events in Ukraine . 	1
MT	125	The developments in that conflict should not be left to former Cold War opponents alone , for that course can only lead to escalation in some form . 	0
MT	126	Furthermore , Ukraine is culturally and geographically much closer than other countries that the EU ( used to ) get involved with . 	0
MT	127	Indeed one could argue that a country has to deal with internal political changes itself , but political power also brings about political responsibility , in this case the responsibility to protect the Ukrainian people from the rather strong interests of the two Great Powers . 	0
MT	128	That the same actors time and again get to have a laugh at exotic shooting locations ? 	0
MT	129	What are you paying for , then ? 	0
MT	130	Curiously , however , there are still adverts and product placements on the public channels . 	0
MT	131	Actually only those people should pay a TV & radio licence fee who really watch ARD , ZDF , Arte etc . It is in fact good to support sophisticated programming through fees . 	1
MT	132	Our society is in danger of overheating due to ' never clocking off ' . 	0
MT	133	Even though politicians stress the Christian character of our country , the last 20 years have seen the Sunday off work increasingly sacrificed to commerce . 	0
MT	134	But after all , the purpose of having a day off is not just to make time to go to church . 	0
MT	135	Rather it should give people the chance to have a mental break . 	0
MT	136	That ' s why there ought to be one day a week when supermarkets and shopping centres stay closed . 	1
MT	137	Indeed , however , it ' s already the case today that students of apparently ' uniform-free ' schools are essentially wearing a uniform consisting of certain brand-name garments . 	0
MT	138	Some may find the idea of a school uniform anachronistic , or regard it as too much of an intervention into the leeway of students and parents to make decisions . 	0
MT	139	A simply designed practical outfit would even out the overall visual image of a school , and direct attention towards the character and achievements of the students - and not their buying power . 	1
MT	140	And yet now I ' ll actually have all the more time for them . 	0
MT	141	I ' m also tired of my data boosting the market value of that corporation . 	0
MT	142	Facebook warns me emphatically that I may lose contact with my friends . 	0
MT	143	Today I will delete my Facebook account . 	1
MT	144	Not only because I ' m constantly astonished about who wants to be my friend . 	0
MT	145	Besides , the purchase of such CDs is unnecessary today , as , due to changed terms of business , many banks urge their customers to turn themselves in . 	0
MT	146	Admittedly the number of immigrants is constantly rising in Germany , but without sufficient , well-qualified junior employees there is hardly a possibility for adequate pension financing . 	0
MT	147	The implementation of retirement at 63 is no longer socially sustainable , as the population in Germany has , viewed demographically , a disproportionate number of old people , and constantly declining birth rates are being recorded . 	1
MT	148	Because for one thing , their products will still sell in bad times , and in addition , such a share is not as sensitive as those of other IT companies . 	0
MT	149	Although IBM ' s numbers haven ' t been staggering recently , and the mood in the stock market could be better on the whole , you should buy IBM shares if you want to invest . 	1
MT	150	This is also more akin to the real working world later , where performance isn ' t singular , but constant and has to be delivered over longer periods . 	0
MT	151	The idea of the bachelor degree is to put together a cumulative grade from various individual assignments in order to generate a final grade . 	0
MT	152	However , the effort required for the individual equally weighted modules differs strongly . 	0
MT	153	That ' s why it makes sense that the bachelor thesis only makes up a relatively small portion of the final grade ( 15 out of 120 credits ) . 	0
MT	154	It would therefore be wise to adjust the required effort for final theses accordingly . 	1
MT	155	Energy saving light bulbs contain a significant amount of toxins . 	0
MT	156	A commercially available bulb may contain for example up to five milligrams of mercury . 	0
MT	157	That ' s why they should be taken off the market , unless they ' re unbreakable . 	1
MT	158	But precisely this is unfortunately not the case . 	0
MT	159	Both the drawn-out building operations and the mounting safety issues show clear shortcomings in the entire planning . 	0
MT	160	BER should be re-conceptualized from scratch , even if billions of Euros have already been invested in the existing airport project and this would delay the date of completion indefinitely . 	1
MT	161	Especially the home games have seen the team stay behind expectations . 	0
MT	162	Berlin ' s basketball team has just come out of a sobering season . 	1
MT	163	Indeed the team ended up third in the league , but given the cost of the star-players one could ' ve expected more . 	0
MT	164	A sad highlight : Losing 60 : 87 to the weakish Mannheimers in a sold-out stadium . 	0
MT	165	Humanity has made enough mistakes throughout history by waiting too long , and when it has finally reacted , the only remaining option has usually been war . 	0
MT	166	A violation of international law should be more than enough to consider a reaction ! 	0
MT	167	Since , however , in Russia besides gas and oil only propaganda and corruption rule , the EU should intervene right away . 	1
MT	168	It ' s to be noted that in our civilized world , in a democratic country , the people can determine their own fate , as long as the motivation of those people isn ' t triggered by propaganda , corruption and military pressure . 	0
MT	169	If however one could find a compromise between green space and housing , then Tempelhofer Feld should definitely be made available for residential construction . 	1
MT	170	Admittedly the fields have currently become an attractive leisure park with sporting areas for many visitors and Berliners , especially in spring and summer . 	0
MT	171	Since the area belongs to the federal state , or the federation , it could even be used for social housing with affordable rents . 	0
MT	172	For years there has been a housing shortage in Berlin , so that using Tempelhofer Feld , which offers a lot of open space and is currently hardly developed , as living space is a sensible idea . 	0
MT	173	But I want to experience this incredible moment of freedom that skydivers report time and again . 	0
MT	174	Besides , Jochen was given a parachute jump the other day as a gift , and it mustn ' t be that this wannabe-adventurer has one up on me . 	0
MT	175	Tomorrow I will skydive for the first time in my life . 	1
MT	176	Yes , there is a certain risk to life . 	0
MT	177	For dog dirt left on the pavement dog owners should by all means pay a bit more . 	1
MT	178	Indeed it ' s not the fault of the animals , but once you step in it , their excrement seems to stick rather persistently to your soles . 	0
MT	179	And many a video game is physically and particularly mentally more demanding , when I think of the last FIFA tournament ' s final , than kicking a ball 20 metres . 	0
MT	180	Plus the hurdle to make video games Olympic events is minimal , as you don ' t even need doping tests , only a neutral console . 	0
MT	181	Perhaps it is less thrilling for a spectator than for the player , but also for contemporary Olympic events , I recall curling and 50km cross-country skiing , you have to be more than a freak to follow those more properly than only in the roundup of highlights . 	0
MT	182	It would be fair to make them into an Olympic event . 	1
MT	183	Video games , namely FIFA in my case , can fascinate young people for hours more intensively and emotionally than any sport in the world ! 	0
MT	184	I find the peripheral housing development at Tempelhofer Feld right for urban planning reasons , as the area is right in the middle of the city ( capital ) . 	1
MT	185	The size of the field allows for both housing and generous open space . 	0
MT	186	A dog dirt-free city will be more attractive not only for its residents but also for tourists ! 	0
MT	187	Increasing penalties is therefore the right way . 	1
MT	188	A fine for leaving dog waste behind admittedly seems rather authoritarian , but similar rules are often in place for bicycles on park paths , after all . 	0
MT	189	Time and again children or the elderly slip on them . 	0
MT	190	Pieces of dog poo on the pavements are a real danger . 	0
MT	191	Complementary medicine includes treatments with proven health benefits in many areas which are often less costly than medication from conventional medicine , which are also paid for after all . 	0
MT	192	Often natural treatments do not put as much of a strain on the patient . 	0
MT	193	Such therapies can frequently result in an improvement in the condition through the active participation of the patient . 	0
MT	194	The health insurance companies ought to be enabled to recognize a doctor ' s decision for natural treatment and also to cover it . 	1
MT	195	For , due to the low birth rate , the proportion of the elderly population and with it pension costs are on the rise , and furthermore , due to today ' s healthcare most people in many occupations are fitter for work in old age than before . 	0
MT	196	Although the workload is getting heavier in many professions and physical and psychological wear on personnel is steadily increasing , the statutory retirement age should in the future not remain at 63 years . 	1
MT	197	Raising the relative retirement age on the basis of the physical fitness of the average citizen is fair . 	1
MT	198	Yet no one should be required to work for more than 40 years . 	0
MT	199	Thus social security and pension costs are increasing . 	0
MT	200	Germany ' s aging society is undergoing demographic change , and the age of those who are physically and mentally fit is increasing steadily . 	0
MT	201	If there must be rent increases , there should also be a cap to avoid nasty surprises . 	0
MT	202	Rent increases upon re-letting aren ' t bad as such , if it ' s only a small amount , With those kinds of amounts you think twice about whether you really want to stay in the flat . 	0
MT	203	That the landlords are then slightly restricted in the administration of their property is not a problem , as they have more pull in the end anyway . 	0
MT	204	This helps the landlords , as they can adjust their expenses through the increase , and also the tenants , as they can plan for a maximum rent increase . 	1
MT	205	they ’ re very bad however , if the rent suddenly climbs by €100 or €200 . 	0
MT	206	The prototype of Audi ' s new sports car has car lovers raving . 	1
MT	207	But aside from that the car caters to pretty much every wish . 	0
MT	208	People , however , who work during the week and on Saturdays then have a problem : everyone else can shop weekdays , but they can ' t . 	0
MT	209	Hence it is good when shops are not open on Sundays and public holidays . 	1
MT	210	Likewise public holidays should remain what they are : for some a day of introspection , for others a paid day off that is not taken away from the annual paid leave proper . 	0
MT	211	Supermarket employees and people who work in shopping centres also have the right to a Sunday off work . 	0
MT	212	One should not re-introduce capital punishment in Germany , since no one can claim the right to rule over the life or death of another human being . 	1
MT	213	Capital punishment will not deter anyone else from an atrocity . 	0
MT	214	Everyone must be given the chance to hone their conscience and possibly make amends for their deed . 	0
MT	215	Admittedly trash and turmoil are exactly what the majority of people want to see . 	0
MT	216	The thought of television exclusively made up of private channels scares me . 	0
MT	217	Only in public TV programmes can viewers get information that is not profit-oriented . 	0
MT	218	But to therefore offer TV according to audience rates only would be dangerous . 	0
MT	219	And since it is the duty of society to collectively finance certain areas that cannot hold their own in a market economy , everyone should chip in . 	1
MT	220	Plus , the state wants me to spend my money , and how am I supposed to do that when the shops aren ' t open when I ' m off work ? 	0
MT	221	Well , I as an employee find it very practical to be able to shop at least on weekends . 	1
MT	222	Sure , other people have to work in the shops on the weekend , but they can have days off during the week and run errands at their leisure while I ' m stuck in the office . 	0
MT	223	Health insurance companies should naturally cover alternative medical treatments . 	1
MT	224	Not all practices and approaches that are lumped together under this term may have been proven in clinical trials , yet it ' s precisely their positive effect when accompanying conventional ' western ' medical therapies that ' s been demonstrated as beneficial . 	0
MT	225	Besides many general practitioners offer such counselling and treatments in parallel anyway - and who would want to question their broad expertise ? 	0
MT	226	Some worry about careless use of such measures , but this problem should rather be addressed with comprehensive prior education . 	0
MT	227	The morning-after pill ought to be available over-the-counter in pharmacies . 	1
MT	228	Even with state-of-the-art contraceptives there can be mistakes and problems and an unwanted pregnancy can place a significant strain on both the parents and the child for the rest of their lives . 	0
MT	229	Considering their requirements , some video games are not relevant as sports , but this issue should be solvable through a clearly structured preselection process . 	0
MT	230	Various skills are promoted and required by different games , including planning abilities , reaction time , and reasoning to name but a few . 	0
MT	231	The performance often required by players is considerable and by all means comparable to physical efforts . 	0
MT	232	Video games ought to be included in the ranks of Olympic events . 	1
MT	233	In a few decades our society will have a disproportionate number of old people : the life expectancy is constantly rising , and at the same time birth rates are declining . 	1
MT	234	Although having children has become more fashionable again in recent years , these short-term fluctuations in birth rates don ' t change the general trend at all . 	0
MT	235	Voters have become more sceptical . 	0
MT	236	Too many promises have not been kept . 	0
MT	237	There are parliamentary elections soon and traditionally the governing party is generous with popular promises in the run-up to federal elections . 	0
MT	238	Nevertheless the head of government , Merkel , had better restrain herself in announcing handouts this year . 	1
MT	239	But what is the good of a wonderfully outfitted university if it doesn ' t actually allow the majority of clever people to broaden their horizons with all that great equipment ? 	0
MT	240	Even without tuition fees half of the student population has to work while studying and hence has less time for studying or recreation . 	0
MT	241	One could argue that an increase in tuition fees would allow institutions to be better equipped . 	0
MT	242	German universities should on no account charge tuition fees . 	1
MT	243	This would simply mean that only those people with wealthy parents or a previous education and a part-time job while studying would be able to apply for a degree programme in the first place . 	0
MT	244	The effectiveness of many natural remedies has not been demonstrated . 	0
MT	245	They should not be spent on personal preferences without proven use . 	0
MT	246	Yet the funds of the health insurance companies are a common benefit for all premium payers . 	0
MT	247	The choice of an attending physician is at the discretion of the patient . 	0
MT	248	Intelligence services should be more closely regulated by parliament , for , as the most recent NSA wiretapping scandal has shown , the federal state government is allegedly not always familiar with the scope of operations of its intelligence services . 	1
MT	249	Checks could contribute to restricting the so far rather opaque scope of action of individual services . 	0
MT	250	Yet it remains questionable whether the actual implementation of such supervision would at the same time lead to a stronger observance of laws , as ultimately this decision is in the hands of the respective government leaders . 	0
MT	251	Therefore no unproven and unrecognized treatments by naturopaths should be reimbursed by the insurance companies . 	1
MT	252	Retirement at 63 , that ' s something everyone who has toiled away ( nonstop ) up to this point surely deserves . 	0
MT	253	Only the question remains whether this early ' leisure ' will be nicer if you have no idea what do to all day and you statistically still have almost 20 ( ! ! ! ) years to go ? 	0
MT	254	Also , one isn ' t taking responsibility for society if one gives up one ' s experienced , healthy and highly qualified capabilities earlier than necessary for private / personal reasons . 	0
MT	255	Especially now , as there is a lack of skilled labour , it ' s irresponsible for the economy and prosperity to retire at 63 . 	1
MT	256	Always having to visit the doctor first ( including travel and waiting time , possible embarrassment , etc . ) leads to more unwanted pregnancies . 	0
MT	257	Many opponents of the pill point out that this does away with the consultation at the doctor ' s and many women take it unnecessarily . 	0
MT	258	Being a pharmacist myself , I argue categorically in favour of over-the-counter availability of the morning-after pill in pharmacies . 	1
MT	259	From a medical perspective the morning-after pill works best when taken as soon as possible after intercourse . 	0
MT	260	However , the fact is that we pharmacists are legally required to inform the patients and possess the same subject matter expertise as doctors . 	0
MT	261	But for snap shots that ' s still enough . 	0
MT	262	I can only recommend the new smartphone XYZ-123 to everyone . 	1
MT	263	Of course the camera could be better , as it only has mediocre resolution and images in dark surroundings are often snowy . 	0
MT	264	Many people see proven relief of their symptoms and complaints by complementary medicine . 	0
MT	265	However there is no substantiated data that this healing isn ' t simply due to the placebo effect . 	0
MT	266	Besides many practices in this field are not regulated professions , which means that quacks and phonies can practice these occupations unknown to the patients . 	0
MT	267	That ' s why the statutory health insurance companies should not cover such treatments . 	1
MT	268	It would be conceivable to invest more into the training and control of this occupation sector on the part of the state . 	0
MT	269	For these reasons supermarkets and shopping centres should not be allowed to be open for business on arbitrary Sundays and holidays . 	1
MT	270	On top of that , private and family life suffers massively because of this reduction and shifting in designated off-times . 	0
MT	271	And it ’ s only the large companies that can afford the additional personnel expenditure . 	0
MT	272	Due to the increase in opening hours on Sundays and holidays there is a rise in employment . 	0
MT	273	However it ' s mainly temps ( that is , students , pupils etc . ) who are employed , so this has hardly any effect on the level of full-time employment and the number of unemployed . 	0
MT	274	Even if one might think that additional rent control is needed besides the current tenant protection , one should not deny longstanding owners the opportunity to adjust their returns to market level . 	0
MT	275	A cap on rent increases upon tenant change is therefore not to be supported . 	1
MT	276	Rent prices are already regulated in favour of tenants due to existing laws and the rent index . 	0
MT	277	In view of the high prices for buying flats with existing rent contracts , these are an unattractive investment . 	0
MT	278	Rent prices should be limited by a cap when there ' s a change of tenant . 	1
MT	279	Landlords may want to earn as much as possible , and many , consistent with market principles , are prepared to pay higher rents , but that people with the same income suddenly must pay more and can ' t live in the same flat anymore seems implausible . 	0
MT	280	Gentrification destroys entire districts and their culture . 	0
MT	281	Also the rules of the public transportation services are rarely observed . 	0
MT	282	Every day passengers are harassed by hooligans and drunks on the underground , trains and busses . 	0
MT	283	Passengers would definitely feel safer then . 	0
MT	284	This is why we need more police presence in public transport , even if there are actually designated in-house security forces . 	1
MT	285	Fear of punishment hence does not deter murderers . 	0
MT	286	Despite the death penalty there are significantly more homicides in the US than in Germany . 	0
MT	287	The state ought to prevent murder - not avenge it . 	1
MT	288	' An eye for an eye ' seems to miss the point . 	0
MT	289	A re-introduction of capital punishment in Germany would be a step back into the Middle Ages . 	0
MT	290	Thus Sundays should remain a day for getting together with family , otherwise there will be a new kind of leisure activity where people spend their time in supermarkets instead of outside or in conversation etc . Furthermore , there ' s no need to keep shops open on Sundays . 	0
MT	291	For you can go shopping 6 days a week , as shops are open till 10pm on some days . 	0
MT	292	It is quite clear that Sunday should remain a day of rest . 	1
MT	293	Besides you ' re not allowed to leave other rubbish without punishment . 	0
MT	294	One reason for this is that they have thus far hardly had to fear the consequences despite the obligation to clean up . 	0
MT	295	Dog owners should pay higher fines for dog dirt left on pavements , although there aren ' t enough bins and bag-dispensers for dog dirt . 	1
MT	296	The city , especially the green spaces , should be kept tidy after all , for they are there for our recreation . 	0
MT	297	A higher fine , so dog owners would have to dig deeper into their pockets , is supposed to be a deterrent after all . 	0
MT	298	One could worry that our farmers would then run into economic difficulties . 	0
MT	299	We should thus all limit our consumption of meat rigorously . 	1
MT	300	Furthermore , the production of meat is comparably resource-intensive . 	0
MT	301	Excessive consumption of meat is unhealthy . 	0
MT	302	However , no serious economist has confirmed this prediction to date . 	0
MT	303	However , a death would not be of any more use to those affected and their relatives than if the felon receives a long sentence . 	0
MT	304	If Germany were to introduce the death penalty , convicted felons could not be paroled or break out of prison and commit new felonies . 	0
MT	305	Handing out capital punishment is unethical . 	0
MT	306	Plus we don ' t live in medieval times anymore . 	0
MT	307	We don ' t need it . 	1
MT	308	Many European countries , for instance the Netherlands , Sweden and Great Britain , have already understood this and successfully adjusted the opening hours for retailers . 	0
MT	309	Considering the growing digitization of society , the traditional model of the weekend will soon be obsolete . 	0
MT	310	However , especially for working customers this would mean greater flexibility and fewer nerve-racking peak times during the week . 	0
MT	311	This may be a change for the employees that cannot to be implemented easily . 	0
MT	312	Supermarkets and shopping centres should be allowed to open on any Sundays and holidays . 	1
MT	313	But even without an ex-girlfriend he would never touch that . 	0
MT	314	Ralf does insist that they drank advocaat together . 	0
MT	315	Thus one of his ex-girlfriends must have been there . 	1
MT	316	When he got back from Ralf ' s party last night he was still stone-cold sober . 	0
MT	317	Whenever Peter bumps into an ex-girlfriend at a party , he forgoes any further consumption of alcohol just in case . 	0
MT	318	Capital punishment would be murder and would have to be punished with the death penalty itself . 	0
MT	319	What , then , ought to be done with criminals who have committed truly awful crimes such as murder or rape - should they simply be allowed to live on although they have taken or destroyed another life ? 	0
MT	320	Germany should by no means introduce capital punishment . 	1
MT	321	If there were capital punishment , this would mean people are allowed to put themselves above others and rule over their lives . 	0
MT	322	Yes , for it is a much graver punishment to be imprisoned forever and be tortured by one ' s own thoughts than to be killed quickly and easily by an injection . 	0
MT	323	Besides , a higher degree of luxury ( expensive flats ) is not necessary for the majority of the people , but rather a flat at all . 	0
MT	324	A stop must be put to exorbitant rents by imposing a limit on rent increases when changing residences . 	1
MT	325	No , the retirement age should be raised to 65 again . 	1
MT	326	People are getting older on average , but they are not sicker and not duller because of it . 	0
MT	327	Without them we ' d forgo a great deal of collected experience . 	0
MT	328	And we ' d have to offer more leisure activities for seniors . 	0
MT	329	Just as with other choices in culture or infrastructure , public broadcasters are also to be financed , regardless of whether individuals make use of their programming or not . 	0
MT	330	However , it is impossible to monitor this and collect more customized fees . 	0
MT	331	I do doubt that there is anyone who has never at least indirectly watched the programming of the public broadcasters . 	0
MT	332	Critics point out that they are not using what ' s on offer by public broadcasting . 	0
MT	333	The TV / radio licence fee can only be required of all citizens / households equally . 	1
MT	334	I think Fritz has never been in a fight in his life . 	1
MT	335	As a boy he did use to scuffle with the other choirboys , but that hardly counts as a proper brawl . 	0
MT	336	And he always chickens out when things get dicey . 	0
MT	337	Yesterday , when the bouncer wouldn ' t let us in , he was suddenly gone . 	0
MT	338	Yet the fees are demanded from everybody who does not apply for a waiver , no matter how many receiver devices actually exist in the household and how they are being used . 	0
MT	339	However it is obvious that the license fee officers are not in a position to check the usage of every single device . 	0
MT	340	The TV license fee should only be collected from those who actually make use of the programming of the public broadcasters . 	1
MT	341	After all there are many people in Germany who pay the fee although they merely use a computer to work . 	0
MT	342	No one should have the possibility to pick up the morning-after pill over the counter at the pharmacy . 	1
MT	343	Though there ' d be the advantage of forgoing the embarrassment of a visit to the doctor or a nighttime trip to the walk-in clinic , women should still be informed about the risks and have a gynaecological examination before taking it . 	0
MT	344	Furthermore there ' s the risk that women could use the over-the-counter morning-after pill as a substitute for contraception . 	0
MT	345	The patient could learn to be more aware of his or her body and to treat it more healthily . 	0
MT	346	This will do little damage to the pharmaceutical industry , and conventional medicine will also hardly suffer . 	0
MT	347	A reduction in the amount of chemically produced medication per person is most certainly desirable . 	1
MT	348	From time immemorial humans have had complementary medicine , and it has not generally been ineffective . 	0
MT	349	Of course it would be nice and simple if after a fun night out with a party acquaintance you could simply take the ' morning-after pill ' and feel at ease . 	0
MT	350	But it ' s not that simple . 	0
MT	351	Perhaps a new life was already created that night . 	0
MT	352	I would kill it without further thought . 	0
MT	353	That ' s why a visit to the doctor and professional advice should remain mandatory . 	1
MT	354	With a BA dissertation one can , however , demonstrate interests and subject matter expertise particularly well . 	0
MT	355	After all one doesn ' t excel in every subject . 	0
MT	356	The BA dissertation should , if not make up the entire grade , then at least constitute a larger share of it . 	1
MT	357	For a good overall grade opens many doors , but is not of top priority for employers . 	0
MT	358	Capital punishment is not a solution , as it cannot be ruled out that the judicial process may make mistakes . 	0
MT	359	Criminals should not be put in luxury prisons , though . 	0
MT	360	After all there are criminals who enjoy ' living ' in prison for its decent board , no taxes to be paid , no stress with work . 	0
MT	361	Still , the state needs the death penalty as a deterrent to horrific crimes . 	1
MT	362	Dog owners may think that dog dirt is only a harmless secretion of an animal like any other . 	0
MT	363	That ' s why causing such obstacles must to be more urgently punished . 	1
MT	364	This results in a lack of alertness in the road traffic comparable to a minor offense of the traffic regulations . 	0
MT	365	Dog dirt on the pavement requires my complete , ground-focused attention on my way to work . 	0
MT	366	Yet then they misjudge its impact on road traffic . 	0
PE	367	Simply put , charging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful . 	1
PE	368	In conclusion , " rush hours " are usually not the direct consequence of drivers . 	1
PE	369	Sometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light , or unreasonable organization of roadways . 	0
PE	370	In these cases , the one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner , not drivers . 	0
PE	371	Majority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance , and charging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights . 	0
PE	372	Rather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee , government should instead , be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental-friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil . 	1
PE	373	Buying a car spends hundreds of thousand ; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several-these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear . 	0
PE	374	Charging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous . 	1
PE	375	Instead , the real causes of traffic jam may fall on various of grounds , and therefore , charging drivers for another fee for this could be unreasonable and irrational . 	1
PE	376	Tourist often decide to discover the culture of a country when they visit through those old buildings . 	0
PE	377	Therefore , managers of cities can earn more money from the attraction provided by old buildings and that amount can be spent on their conservation . 	1
PE	378	In my opinion , all of the old building which contribute to our sense of culture should be conserved . 	1
PE	379	There are different reasons which persuade that people should not restore old buildings . 	0
PE	380	Old buildings should be preserved 	0
PE	381	The preservation of old buildings always is a large question for governments because conflict between the issues of housing for citizens and the protection of our culture . 	0
PE	382	Besides that , the preservation is very expensive because all components of old buildings have historical values . 	0
PE	383	Old buildings are an essential part of history . 	0
PE	384	As a result of the rapid urbanization process , in which rural people must go to urban centers to look for job opportunities , the question of the preservation of old buildings has become more pressing . 	0
PE	385	Because of that need , governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings . 	1
PE	386	Developing globalization , people can have more access to many natural resources of the world and it leads to increasing the pace of scientific and economic promotions of the entire world . 	0
PE	387	During the history of the world , every change has its own positive and negative sides . 	0
PE	388	However , the jury giving the verdict are also humans . 	0
PE	389	They have the life of a person at their discretion . 	0
PE	390	They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent , circumstantially marred criminals . 	1
PE	391	The jury must therefore , take into account the circumstances of committing a crime . 	0
PE	392	When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment , they will fear and not commit such crimes . 	0
PE	393	Thus , the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased . 	1
PE	394	Importantly , capital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals . 	0
PE	395	Criminals who don ' t have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are , therefore , given capital punishment . 	1
PE	396	For example , if an individual murders someone for self-defense , then such a crime is not heinous . 	0
PE	397	Only deserving criminals , who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment . 	0
PE	398	Taking part in the study groups would increase student ' s motivation to study more . 	1
PE	399	In a word , attending boys and girls in a same school would bring many advantages . 	1
PE	400	In addition , they would be able to know the opposite gender , which help them to be prepared for the adult life where they almost will live or work together . 	1
PE	401	Boys and girls will try to show their capabilities and abilities in the class , therefore they will study increasingly . 	0
PE	402	Moreover , attending in the school having boys and girls might be beneficial for both to increase their motivation to study better . 	1
PE	403	As a result , the productivity of the class will be increased . 	0
PE	404	Indeed , Boys do not like to seem weak in front of girls and vice versa . 	0
PE	405	So , communicating in single language will reduce the problems of travelers in daily activities like ordering food in a restaurant or in going around places . 	0
PE	406	Due to globalization , many people are traveling for professional trips . 	0
PE	407	As a consequence , various local languages are becoming extinct . 	0
PE	408	Its usage is increasing day by day . 	0
PE	409	Today , English is commonly used language across the world . 	0
PE	410	Various local languages are becoming extinct 	0
PE	411	A world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way . 	1
PE	412	In my opinion , I believe using single language through out the world is a positive change which is helping the world to become a better place to live . 	1
PE	413	While there are others who disagree with this and are more concerned about dying local languages . 	0
PE	414	Some people argue that , this is a positive change and would help people to easily communicate . 	0
PE	415	These days , most of countries on the world invest for technology . 	0
PE	416	Traditional skills and ways are always valuable and will last forever 	0
PE	417	Many people think that conventional things will not exist and should be eliminated . 	0
PE	418	It is evident that technology promotes economy . 	0
PE	419	First of all , traditional skills and ways belong to value of culture . 	1
PE	420	I totally disagree this opinion . 	0
PE	421	Every country has unique tradtions which show their creation , intelligence . 	0
PE	422	They make differences between countries . 	0
PE	423	For example , ways to build a house in every country are different and they distinguish between countries . 	0
PE	424	Consequently , people feel pround of their country , so they keep reserving conventions . 	0
PE	425	In conclusion , considering the rise in accident rates , violent crime rates and suicide rates , I support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence . 	1
PE	426	Finally , a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented . 	1
PE	427	As astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in , scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks . 	0
PE	428	By observing planet earth from outer space , people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth . 	0
PE	429	With this knowledge , people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming . 	0
PE	430	As a conclusion , I personally think that human beings should travel to outer space . 	1
PE	431	In spite of costing a fortune , space exploration has given aforementioned benefits . 	0
PE	432	Oxygen tanks , for instance , are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater . 	0
PE	433	Moreover , spaceships , communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society . 	0
PE	434	It will help people around the world understand each other more . 	0
PE	435	Since , international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way . 	1
PE	436	When many people congregate in one place , I think that some kinds of social problems will follow . 	0
PE	437	International sporting events are a good change to create a multi-nation community of fans having the same passion . 	0
PE	438	In conclusion , university restriction has both pros and cons . 	0
PE	439	Apart from the disheartened ones , many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs , mostly the white-collar ones . 	0
PE	440	What is more , there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people . 	1
PE	441	Therefore , it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people , who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively . 	1
PE	442	That ' s why it should be made available for a wide range of learners . 	1
PE	443	In my opinion , it will yield more negative results than positive ones . 	1
PE	444	Moreover , when people have jobs , they will have money to spend on goods and services . 	0
PE	445	For the time of occasions , people regardless of nationality , origin and religion will live together . 	0
PE	446	It is inevitable to be exposed to the environment full of advertisements but it does not mean that our right to choose is taken away . 	0
PE	447	Besides , advertising might lead to healthier eating customs due to the growing awareness of living under a better lifestyle . 	1
PE	448	We will always be able to decide our own lifestyles . 	0
PE	449	Health education will help people to have right choices of treatment to recover more quickly . 	0
PE	450	Many diseases which may be cured easily can turn to serious ones if we do not have right treatment . 	0
PE	451	Instead of afraid or panic , they may be calmer if unfortunately committing some normal diseases such as allergy or illness in seasonal changes . 	0
PE	452	Secondly , health education will prepare for people especially children necessary knowledge to protect themselves from risks of diseases . 	0
PE	453	For example , if a child is educated to have a hygienic lifestyle at a very young age , he also keeps it when older . 	0
PE	454	First of all , thank to a full health education from their childhoods , children will have good habits of taking care of their own health and these habits may be kept in their adolescences . 	0
PE	455	Health education causes long-term positive effects on our next generations . 	1
PE	456	Once applied , it will bring many benefits to both citizens and governments . 	0
PE	457	It is a completely right and extremely wise policy to focus on health education and preventative measures rather than treatment . 	1
PE	458	Prevention is better than cure 	0
PE	459	It is are easy and usable . 	1
PE	460	In my point of view , listening to music , exercising , and doing meditation are the most activities that people could do to escape from stress . 	1
PE	461	In conclusion , there are many ways to reduce the stress . 	0
PE	462	These could relieve me from stress . 	0
PE	463	A way to do meditation is that I just sit down , close my eyes , and count my breath . 	0
PE	464	Meditation is easy way to relax because it is not require any equipment , and it take few minutes . 	0
PE	465	when I have many things to think about , and this make me stress , I will do meditation . 	0
PE	466	Third , meditation also one of the ways to reduce the stress . 	1
PE	467	And everyone should find the time to do more and more to feel better physically and in everyone mind . 	1
PE	468	The main reason why I believe artists should be funded is because art helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists . 	0
PE	469	For example , monuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city ' s history and culture , but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists . 	0
PE	470	In fact , some countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue , thus , the governments should help arts because their work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry . 	1
PE	471	In addition , sculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation . 	0
PE	472	Funding artists 	0
PE	473	Nowadays , in order to save as much budget as possible and improve the economy of the country , every government around the world is seeking for some ways to spend wisely . 	0
PE	474	Therefore , there is a suggestion that governments should not continue to fund the artists , but they ought to spend money on other necessary subjects such as medical research and space . 	0
PE	475	In my view , I firmly disagree with this recommendation due to several reasons . 	0
PE	476	Therefore , culture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art . 	1
PE	477	Young people are also able to get more knowledge about their country ' s history and culture by observing various work crafts . 	0
PE	478	With the rapid development of the standard of people ' s life , increasing numbers of animal experiments are done , new medicines and foods , for instance . 	0
PE	479	Using animals for the benefit of the human beings 	0
PE	480	In my essay , I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects . 	0
PE	481	Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature , however , I believe that no sensible person will deny that it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals . 	1
PE	482	The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals . 	0
PE	483	First of all , as we all know , animals are friendly and vital for people , because if there are no animals in the world , the balance of nature will broke down , and we , human , will die out as well . 	0
PE	484	Though animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance , it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life . 	0
PE	485	In other words , doing this various testing is a hazard of human ' s future and next generation . 	1
PE	486	The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human ' s life . 	0
PE	487	To begin with , it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious , and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying . 	1
PE	488	In conclusion , there are abovementioned three key points of positive effects of aid ; supporting poor countries to make its economy strong and building humane concepts to people , keeping strong global economy . 	1
PE	489	When America mortgage loan system went bad , several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated , even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt . 	0
PE	490	In globalized world , the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others . 	0
PE	491	Third , the campaigns might include practical benefits . 	1
PE	492	It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love , but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization . 	0
PE	493	If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases , they would never take their abundance for granted . 	0
PE	494	Secondly , aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people . 	1
PE	495	Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties . 	0
PE	496	there are certain period of time for teachers to teach . 	0
PE	497	I strongly believe that being a global neighbor by aiding poor countries would be continues by many organizations and volunteers , and it will make the earth a better place to live . 	1
PE	498	In the zoo you can see an animal and their different variations , the male and the female or the baby and the adult . 	0
PE	499	If you visit the zoo , you get to watch the animals , their customs , what they eat and how they eat it , as well as which characteristics the different species have . 	0
PE	500	We can learn a lot from books and lectures , but there is an even better way to learn , that is visuals and personal experience . 	0
PE	501	Animals , the different species , their habitats and behaviors are a subject of study at schools and universities . 	0
PE	502	Finally , a visit to the zoo will help increasing someone ' s respect and appreciation for animals . 	1
PE	503	Visiting the zoo would help the students understand what they learn at school . 	1
PE	504	Moreover , it will also help identify which animals could be dangerous . 	0
PE	505	It offers a great opportunity to observe their reactions to different situations , such as weather , specie and genre interaction , defense behavior , or protection of their babies . 	0
PE	506	This is especially true for people living in the city , where the only animals they normally interact with are pets like cats and dogs . 	0
PE	507	It is a lot easier to appreciate something after you have seen it , and learned from it . 	0
PE	508	Should teachers be paid according to how much their students learn ? 	0
PE	509	Moreover , another daily expense is also the considerable outgoings . 	0
PE	510	Furthermore , museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages ; therefore , these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture . 	1
PE	511	It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos , so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it . 	0
PE	512	On the one hand , technology indeed simplifies people ' s life all the time . 	0
PE	513	Although modern technology make it possible , I still believe some museums and art galleries will not disappear . 	1
PE	514	It is quite common that more and more people can watch exhibitions through television or internet at home due to modern technology ; therefore , some people think museums and art galleries will disappear soon . 	0
PE	515	Museums and art galleries will disappear soon ? 	0
PE	516	First of all , authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos . 	0
PE	517	On the other hand , the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture . 	1
PE	518	However , in accordance with recent research , experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy because they lack of physical exercise and face-to-face communication . 	0
PE	519	Obviously , people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home , save the time and money on the road , which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society . 	1
PE	520	Because I could find a better way to solve problems . 	0
PE	521	In conclusion , experiences that shape my thinking and the way to live my life are teach me to be a better person . 	1
PE	522	This experience change me to concern about making plan for my future life . 	0
PE	523	Consequently , I start changing myself from spending many thing that I want to saving money for my entire life . 	0
PE	524	These experiences taught me to change my life to be a better person . 	1
PE	525	Moreover , these experiences could make me to make plan for my future life . 	0
PE	526	Besides , experiences could shape me to be more aware about my health . 	0
PE	527	Therefore , instead of interfering children ' s creativity , technology actually encourages children to learn and to create . 	1
PE	528	It is true that TV is one of the prime source of data and information . 	0
PE	529	There are international and local news channels like BBC , CNBC , Etv Gujarati , Etv Marathi etc to keep individuals updated about latest happenings . 	0
PE	530	By watching TV , children can develop skills in extra-curriculum activities . 	1
PE	531	For example , Cooking programs teach about how to make new dishes and similarly , sports events like cricket , football can teach leadership skills , team building skills , communication skills and many more that can help students in their future jobs . 	0
PE	532	Children can effectively learn from watching television 	0
PE	533	TV is an immense source of information and pupils can learn and develop various skills by watching it . 	0
PE	534	But I believe that by allowing students to watch TV at both school and house can adversely impact on their overall growth . 	1
PE	535	If children spend too much time in front of TV , it will negatively impact their health and study . 	1
PE	536	Technology has made life too easy for most children . 	0
PE	537	But on other hand , watching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health . 	1
PE	538	For example , they can get poor eyesight in early ages of childhood , and also develop back pain . 	0
PE	539	Nonetheless , passion on jobs , in my opinion , can bring actual happiness and help us get promoted in working to earn even more money later on . 	1
PE	540	In conclusion , it is undeniable that income is still a vital determination impacting us on choices of careers . 	1
PE	541	Finally , some people choose a career due to their desire to help others and contribute positively to their countries and societies . 	0
PE	542	Besides , important factors in choosing a job such as level of happiness , satisfaction of jobs , personal relationships , professional skills , working environment , managers and colleagues should not be underestimated . 	0
PE	543	Computer was invented for the benefit of mankind and it has fulfilled its objective . 	0
PE	544	Human life today can ' t be imagined without computers , so not depending on them is out of question . 	0
PE	545	Thus , dependence on computers is not a bad thing . 	1
PE	546	However , one needs to be aware of all the pros and cons and beware of malicious things . 	0
PE	547	The recent case of Wikileaks , leaking confidential data is an example of how computers are harmful . 	0
PE	548	Nevertheless , with all the mentioned demerits , computers have provided security and sophistication too . 	1
PE	549	They have even invaded mental health of humans , for example , FAD ( Facebook Addiction Disorder - excessive use of social networking website Facebook ) . 	0
PE	550	Computers have intruded our lives to the effect that a satellite can peep into our homes and privates lives . 	0
PE	551	From my point of view , computers have an important and inevitable role in economic , business , and other part of societies . 	1
PE	552	However , some people especially young ones use computers extremely and this excessive usage lead to increase stress among them , but computers have brought many advantages to our lives . 	0
PE	553	Computers have revolutionized our lifestyle during last century . 	0
PE	554	People benefit more from coming computers into their lives 	0
PE	555	Many industries use computers to command to robots in order to do many regular tasks , which were carried out by human early . 	0
PE	556	Nowadays , computer can control and perform some routine activities in industries , which were early done by human . 	0
PE	557	Admittedly , by using computers in many industries human ' s role has been reduced . 	0
PE	558	In addition , they make the way of living easier by doing our routine duties . 	1
PE	559	In addition , car companies use computers to simulate and analyze car accident by computers . 	0
PE	560	For example , many processes of production of cars are carrying out by robots , which are controlled by computers . 	0
PE	561	Unfortunately , the unstoppable trend of urbanization makes me only appreciate parts of those classic buildings in the pictures or in museums . 	0
PE	562	I will discuss my view in two main areas . 	0
PE	563	Old buildings are reminders of a city ' s culture and complexity . 	0
PE	564	Historic buildings have intrinsic values , because they are significant symbols of a city . 	1
PE	565	Here are some reasons and examples to illustrate my viewpoint . 	0
PE	566	We certainly do not hope for a reduction for these sorts of taxes . 	0
PE	567	It would be highly unpractical to ask people to adopt a simpler way of life . 	0
PE	568	The biggest risk is not taking any risk 	0
PE	569	" The biggest risk is not taking any risk . " 	0
PE	570	The ones who have a big dream , they need to be brave and dare to live new situations . 	0
PE	571	It is not guaranteed that you are going to achieve your dream if you had planned carefully as the same way when you take risks , but it is more frustrating if you had made plans and then it went wrong . 	0
PE	572	Therefore , it is essential to take chances and believe this is going to work out . 	1
PE	573	Assuming new opportunities is indispensable to have diverse experiences . 	1
PE	574	In fact , life may not be easy ; it will have various challenges especially when you take risks , but in the end , it can be surprisingly wonderful . 	0
PE	575	Also , they can save value things in their life such as time and money , and enjoy they life with the best way . 	0
PE	576	In the beginning , it can be tough to fit in this new place and find any opportunity , but after fighting against the obstacles blocking the way to get what is desired ; it is possible to conquer what they are craving as well as start to build a new life in this other country . 	0
PE	577	In fact , many people are afraid to take risks and fail . 	0
PE	578	Moreover , I have always believed that parents and adults relatives are the best friends and consular for the teenagers , because unfortunately nowadays there are some individuals who cheat the others for gaining more power and money . 	1
PE	579	As a result , experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time . 	1
PE	580	What ' s more , people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles . 	1
PE	581	From my point of view , I am in favor the former statement that some tough experiences people met before will be helpful in their life path . 	1
PE	582	To start with , hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their life such as , a shining weather , a delicious breakfast and etc . People who have such nice spirit usually know how to find the true love in their life instead of being seduced by greed as to lose themselves in the end . 	0
PE	583	For that reason , some people advocate that some difficulties people met at their early ages will become an invaluable fortune in their future lives . 	0
PE	584	However , some people think it isn ' t supposed to be that case . 	0
PE	585	Most difficult experiences will become valuable lessons 	0
PE	586	There is a famous old saying that failure is the mother of success . 	0
PE	587	Because they already have such experiences of overcoming some difficulties , they are conscious of what to do and how to do when fierce crisis happens . 	0
PE	588	Those people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career because they are aware of how to lead people to reach success despite what kind of difficulties are getting in their way . 	0
PE	589	To sum up , I have to concede to the materialistic diversion from treatment to health education and preventative measures . 	1
PE	590	This will yield positive results on not only the people ' s physical and mental development but also their finance . 	1
PE	591	Experiences that have shaped your outlook and the way you live 	0
PE	592	What is more , the ever-increasing huntings are having a heavy toll on rare and specious species . 	0
PE	593	Only when zoos appear are such distinction-driven animals as : giraffe , panda , koala or leopard provided with their own inaccessible territory . 	0
PE	594	In sum , the role of zoos towards both human and animals is undeniably indispensable . 	1
PE	595	It is highly recommended that zoos should be seen with different perspective in order to function at their most efficiency . 	0
PE	596	Many circumstances that I experienced change the way I think . 	1
PE	597	A number of people then may come from any other communities in order to get in to or get the jobs at the university . 	0
PE	598	For example , when I go to office , I use public transport . 	0
PE	599	I see many things such as traffic jam , crowded people at bus stop , and all so crowded people in buses . 	0
PE	600	Thus , many people try to reduce their stress . 	0
PE	601	There are many activities that could relieve those people who are in stress . 	0
PE	602	in my opinion , reducing stress by listening to music , playing sports , and doing meditation are easy and practical ways . 	1
PE	603	First of all , listening to music is a great way to relax . 	1
PE	604	Best ways of reducing stress : listening to music , exercise , meditation 	0
PE	605	Nowadays , we are living in in the world which is absolutely complicated . 	0
PE	606	Everything seem to be rush , and it have a lot of competition . 	0
PE	607	These make people get stress . 	0
PE	608	I will give reasons to support my opinion . 	0
PE	609	To begin with , studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems . 	1
PE	610	Others believe that television , newspapers and magazines should keep us entertained and therefore they should pay attention to famous people lives as well . 	0
PE	611	Getting to know the theory in this area seems really important for our students . 	0
PE	612	Then , the earlier we jump into this area , the more skillful we will be . 	0
PE	613	Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field 	0
PE	614	In today ' s community , economy becomes the order of the day . 	0
PE	615	For the primary concern , it can provide students a sense of direction in academy . 	1
PE	616	Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field , let them to know what this subject mainly discuss . 	0
PE	617	Thus , in my point of view , although it will take some time on it , high school students should take a course on basic economics . 	1
PE	618	Let me explain it in detail . 	0
PE	619	That will help the students cultivate their own interest and a sense of career orientation . 	0
PE	620	Finally , students may study harder for their economic dreams . 	0
PE	621	The third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted . 	1
PE	622	Moreover , in terms of punishment , living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away . 	0
PE	623	Secondly , capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes , life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives . 	1
PE	624	In addition , execution does not resolve the consequences of crime , not to mention it could put the criminal ' s family through hardship while the pain of the victim ' s kin is never to be consoled . 	0
PE	625	Although what criminals cause to the society , specifically to the victims , is indeed significantly offensive , they are humans and their lives need to be valued . 	0
PE	626	First of all , it is recognized that every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life . 	1
PE	627	However , as the society grows , human rights become more highly respected , " murdering " criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept . 	1
PE	628	In a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred , it may be true that the death penalty is an efficient retribution to admonish the violence . 	0
PE	629	Capital punishment is a controversial debate in many countries . 	0
PE	630	Capital punishment is necessary or not ? 	0
PE	631	Nowadays , unscrupulous paparazzi constantly follow celebrities just to take a photo while they are eating or training . 	0
PE	632	Newspapers often receive accusations of checkbook journalism ; this means that magazines pay people a lot of money for stories or photos . 	0
PE	633	To conclude , Earth is our home and it should be protected . 	1
PE	634	Any human activity causing harm to Earth should be controlled and alternate ways should be devised to control damage . 	0
PE	635	Creative ideas should be encouraged to leave minimum environmental footprints without compromising quality of life . 	0
PE	636	To add to it , excess emission of carbon dioxide gas mainly by vehicles around the world has increased the average temperature at north pole which in turn has increased water level due to gradual melting of glaciers . 	0
PE	637	Lastly , either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth . 	1
PE	638	For instance a large amount of unnoticed industrial waste released in oceans effects aquatic life to a large extent . 	0
PE	639	Harmful chemicals present in industrial waste kills lot of sea creatures in oceans or rivers . 	0
PE	640	Besides , there is also an intimate connection between economy and enterprises , students can also gain knowledge more practical and vivid . 	1
PE	641	Also , we can avoid conflicts among students and teachers which can be enjoyable and productive for both instructor and students . 	0
PE	642	Next , students should choose their classes to have progress in their studies and grades . 	0
PE	643	As children of independent country we should know our rights and opportunities we have in order to achieve our goals and dreams . 	0
PE	644	Not allowing students their desired subjects to be chosen is a restriction of human rights . 	0
PE	645	First of all , as I mentioned above students should have a right to choose what they want to study . 	1
PE	646	In my opinion high school should permit students to choose courses they want for several reasons which are freedom of choice , to have progress in students grades and knowledge as well as to help students explore their aptitude . 	1
PE	647	High school is the time when you decide your future career and particular field you want to concentrate and interested in . 	0
PE	648	Educated high-school students with bright and independent mind 	0
PE	649	Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit . 	1
PE	650	For example , when I was taking art class everyone shared the same interests and it was easy to understand each other . 	0
PE	651	Setting up a council to monitor the media information to the public could be a practical idea . 	0
PE	652	Playing baseball provided my upper body for hitting and throwing . 	0
PE	653	Soccer , on the other hand , developed my lower body for kicking and endurance for playing full 90-minute-games . 	0
PE	654	Taking the SARS in 2003 as an example , the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths . 	0
PE	655	Even so , another perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest . 	0
PE	656	The major opposing argument is to protect the safety of citizens . 	0
PE	657	In other words , the government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner , especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases . 	1
PE	658	Some people prefer to spend their free time indoors . 	0
PE	659	But from my experience , I myself prefer to spend my leisure time outdoors because I strongly feel that it is good for health and keep my body fit . 	1
PE	660	Leisure activities - Spend your free time outdoors or indoors . 	0
PE	661	People often relax themselves by joining leisure activities . 	0
PE	662	One benefit is that doing outdoor activities such as soccer and baseball is good for one ' s health . 	1
PE	663	For instance , last year , I spent my summer time playing soccer and baseball . 	0
PE	664	Also , outdoor activities enable me to socialize with other people and enjoy natural beauty . 	1
PE	665	There are strong advantages to spend leisure time outdoors . 	0
PE	666	Obviously , it is waste of time . 	0
PE	667	People need to put much more effort to keep their living condition . 	0
PE	668	Therefore , lives in the old days is easier than today . 	1
PE	669	They must take only a bus to go to another place . 	0
PE	670	If a subway and a sky train are available here , it will be more convenience to them . 	0
PE	671	For example , people can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule . 	0
PE	672	On the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus . 	0
PE	673	Also , this improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly . 	1
PE	674	Secondly , the buses provide merely two routes in this community . 	0
PE	675	It is absolutely a major problem . 	0
PE	676	For example , if a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses , I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus . 	0
PE	677	Many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to lives therefore it should be considered a positive activity while others have held a complete different idea about this . 	0
PE	678	Both views will be critiqued before a reasonable conclusion is drawn . 	0
PE	679	Advertising - positive or negative part of our lives 	0
PE	680	Nowadays , the use of advertisement through different forms of media such as newspapers , radio and television has become very prevalent , so it is thought to be a necessary part of today ' s society . 	0
PE	681	Also , to consumers , advertising can bring them many benefits . 	1
PE	682	For example , customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans . 	0
PE	683	First , it is generally understood that advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more . 	0
PE	684	Advertisements are , therefore , very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits . 	1
PE	685	From all of these , it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support . 	0
PE	686	However , it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts . 	0
PE	687	Children should grow up in a big city ! 	0
PE	688	Taking IT industry for an example , top technical science is published in English . 	0
PE	689	Furthermore , researchers , especially those who work on high-tech , would have wider range of references if they are good at English . 	0
PE	690	Computers and modems bring works to home but these still have many things distract their mind . 	1
PE	691	Doing all jobs at home don ' t make employees attempt to work like this . 	1
PE	692	Hence , the culture heritage and nation identity vanish . 	1
PE	693	Admittedly , opponents may blame that English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year . 	0
PE	694	In conclusion , in spite of some negative effects , I ' m totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around . 	1
PE	695	However , this is really short-sighted , ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society . 	0
PE	696	But at the same time , actions , like recording , can be taken to protect native languages and cultures . 	0
PE	697	I suggest all youths should learn English owing to its key role in globalization . 	0
PE	698	Some people think that working at home brings to workers and employees too much convenience , but i don ' t . 	0
PE	699	Computers have made it possible for office workers to do their work 	0
PE	700	Then again , the workers must try their best to finish the time limit . 	0
PE	701	The directors manage employers and give them the deadline of projects . 	0
PE	702	Each office has its rules that keep workers do their job as effectively as possible . 	0
PE	703	Pressure is motivation . 	0
PE	704	I have a friend that grew up in the countryside . 	0
PE	705	He said that he had to study a lot to pass the test to enter the university . 	0
PE	706	Moreover they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training . 	0
PE	707	In addition , the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination , which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan . 	0
PE	708	The purpose of this essay is to discuss what can students and the organizations benefit from the activity that the students sent by their schools to work for companies without salaries . 	0
PE	709	Benefits of students ' unpaid work 	0
PE	710	To begin with , students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to . 	1
PE	711	In this essay , I would start by analyzing the advantages for doing this for both students and companies , and then I would draw a conclusion at the end . 	0
PE	712	As a result , students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation . 	0
PE	713	In most school curriculums , the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom . 	0
PE	714	As for the companies , the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money . 	0
PE	715	For this reason , the internship , although without pay , can give them the experiences that money cannot buy . 	0
PE	716	I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy . 	0
PE	717	In contrast , it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment . 	0
PE	718	Based on the reasons demonstrated above , I believe that living in a higher pace is better because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite . 	1
PE	719	In other words , I prefer to live in high pace . 	1
PE	720	For instance , I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition , defeating those spending less time on practicing . 	0
PE	721	Hence , from this case we are capable of stating that keeping our pace higher is important . 	1
PE	722	Admittedly , on the other hand , there might be some people proclaiming that with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more because it is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed . 	1
PE	723	However , from my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying . 	0
PE	724	It is not to say , of course that other points of view are totally without merit . 	0
PE	725	Still , I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and plausible . 	0
PE	726	He looked at every aspect that he needed to qualify for the promotion . 	0
PE	727	For example , my boss worked tirelessly for his promotion . 	0
PE	728	Although there are valid arguments to the contrary , it is my belief that the majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication . 	1
PE	729	Yet , there remains some disagreement as to whether the overall effect of this innovation has been positive or negative . 	0
PE	730	With the click of a button , the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds . 	0
PE	731	To begin with , mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business . 	0
PE	732	With a mobile phone or a laptop , a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop , in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine . 	0
PE	733	Furthermore , it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world . 	0
PE	734	Nevertheless , opponents of modern communications claim that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits . 	0
PE	735	Therefore , it seems that these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind . 	1
PE	736	If you believe in luck , you would be clueless about where you are heading . 	0
PE	737	They carefully organize the process of achieving their targets and continue to evaluate their progress until they reach the final goal . 	0
PE	738	He was living in an illusion that he can solve his financial issues with this lottery . 	0
PE	739	For example , a friend of mine , who had severe financial constraints , had the habit of buying lottery tickets thinking that one day he would win a lottery . 	0
PE	740	Thirdly , if you work hard , luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target . 	1
PE	741	However , up to this day his luck has not appeared and problems have got further worsened . 	0
PE	742	To sum up , although supporting art will benefit the human beings and the company in short-term interest , I still hold the environment protection for long-term interest . 	1
PE	743	Biodiversity and a more beautiful nature are not only the results of abetter environment but also are the necessities of photography and other types of art . 	0
PE	744	I confess that art is one of the best ways of entertaining human beings , but , with exhaust fumes and acid rain , we do not have the energy and enthusiasm to appreciate the paintings or photographs . 	0
PE	745	Finally , conservation leads us to a higher standard of living . 	1
PE	746	Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers . 	0
PE	747	However , the current job market affects the decision of universities . 	0
PE	748	They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission . 	0
PE	749	Furthermore , university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination . 	0
PE	750	They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling , teaching , designing etc . Therefore , universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender . 	1
PE	751	They prefer male staff for night shifts . 	0
PE	752	For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine . 	0
PE	753	The job selection criteria are pre decided . 	0
PE	754	When you run into a problem , you can ask your roommates if they can help . 	0
PE	755	It often is the case that your roommates have the skills or knowledge you need . 	0
PE	756	To illustrate , when my computer mysteriously broke down , I dialed up the manufacturer and asked for help . 	0
PE	757	Some of them may have something to offer . 	0
PE	758	To my surprise , one of my roommates noticed my problems and offered to help . 	0
PE	759	They failed to give me any useful solutions . 	0
PE	760	In conclusion , while many people decide to live alone for various reasons , I prefer to live with a roommate , and I always will . 	1
PE	761	He was very good with computers , and he managed to fix the problem quickly . 	0
PE	762	I think single people should live with a roommate , if they want to enjoy their lives . 	0
PE	763	This is because it offers me many advantages , such as less spending , more socializing , and more help . 	1
PE	764	Instead , he hardly cared about something else . 	0
PE	765	For instance , Albert Einstein , one of the most competent physicians in history , devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity . 	0
PE	766	Although , they will not be having a pace and an eager to get on the top as the competitors do , but they shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team . 	1
PE	767	If student do it by themselves , they might be hurt themselves . 	0
PE	768	Classroom have specialist trainer to teach students to it right way . 	0
PE	769	Lastly , learning in classroom , student could have healthier life because in school can provide exercise class which train student to move their body . 	1
PE	770	This important skill cannot be gotten in online classes . 	0
PE	771	On the other hand , the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory . 	0
PE	772	For instance , In a classroom , teacher could give assignment to student to work as a group . 	0
PE	773	Secondly , online class could not provide knowledge about social skills . 	1
PE	774	Unlike classroom , online class just only study in textbook not learnin real situation . 	0
PE	775	First of all , through cooperation , children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students . 	1
PE	776	From this point of view , I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education . 	1
PE	777	During the process of cooperation , children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others , how to communicate with others , how to think comprehensively , and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred . 	0
PE	778	What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly , how to get along with others . 	0
PE	779	It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy . 	0
PE	780	Should students be taught to compete or to cooperate ? 	0
PE	781	In conclusion , I personally disagree this this notion that we should replace classroom with online class . 	1
PE	782	This make students have healthier life which online class cannot provide . 	0
PE	783	There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset . 	0
PE	784	Finally , psychology knows two types of motivation . 	0
PE	785	Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects , the better they perform in academic areas . 	0
PE	786	With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency . 	0
PE	787	Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning . 	0
PE	788	In addition , being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life . 	1
PE	789	Thus they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently . 	0
PE	790	By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching . 	0
PE	791	This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic . 	0
PE	792	Secondly , some students might learn better at home on their own , for instance , by reading the textbook . 	1
PE	793	This is because language can be seen as much more than just one method of communication . 	0
PE	794	Despite of the above arguments , i still strongly believe that the government should try to preserve minority languages . 	1
PE	795	I personally suppose that no matter how widely they are spoken , every language should be protected from being disappeared . 	1
PE	796	The question whether our government should make an effort to preserve them by investing more money on that minority languages or not is still a debatable one . 	0
PE	797	It is true that the increasing number of languages which are at risk of extinction has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today ' s society are very concerned for . 	0
PE	798	Languages ' extinction , discuss both views 	0
PE	799	Secondly , it is obvious that in many aspects such as communication , trade , cooperation as well as transaction , it will be absolutely easier for the whole society to work together in one language only . 	1
PE	800	For example , some certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese , so the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers , facilities and appropriate materials . 	0
PE	801	Firstly , we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages , it can be really expensive because educational programmes will need to be given so as to keep young people learning and using them . 	0
PE	802	There are several reasons why saving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money . 	1
PE	803	The company only needs some technicians to make sure machines are working on the right track or replace some part when machines are not working . 	0
PE	804	However , the disadvantages of machines that bring to us should not be neglected by people . 	1
PE	805	For another , using machines can save company ' s money . 	0
PE	806	Because machines never ask for salary , over-time pay or pension , so employers do not need to spend money on employee ' s welfare . 	0
PE	807	For one thing , machines are more effective than human . 	0
PE	808	Not like human , machines do not need rest , which means they can work as long as employers want and consistently produce high quality products without any mistakes . 	0
PE	809	In my opinion , although using machines have many benefits , we cannot ignore its negative effects . 	1
PE	810	It is undoubted that machines can bring many benefits . 	1
PE	811	Advantages and disadvantages of machines instead of human to do the work 	0
PE	812	The issue of whether using of machine are bring many advantages to society is of great concern to many people . 	0
PE	813	People will spend less time on cooking food 	0
PE	814	However , I do think that people are likely to spend less time in cooking food . 	1
PE	815	The first and foremost reason is that with the development of science and technology , more advanced kitchen facilities , such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers , have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time . 	0
PE	816	There are various reasons why I maintain this viewpoint , and among those reasons are two important ones . 	0
PE	817	Actually , in recent years , there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valuable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework . 	0
PE	818	As a result , people nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two , even three hours like in the last 10 years . 	0
PE	819	He would miss various childhood activities such as hang out with friends , clubs and fun activities and social interaction with others . 	0
PE	820	They have whole life to do job and prove themselves , but the childhood phase will never return in their life . 	0
PE	821	Moreover , they drop out their studies so as to earn more money . 	0
PE	822	In addition to this , the main drawback of teenagers job is that , they miss out the fun of their childhood time . 	0
PE	823	They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money . 	0
PE	824	This would affect their studies , they loose their interest from studies . 	0
PE	825	Another reason , jobs can divert students from their studies . 	1
PE	826	If students started earning in earlier age in their life , then they get attracted towards money . 	0
PE	827	They won ' t be able to get proper time for relaxation , sleep . 	0
PE	828	Thus , would affect their mental and physical health . 	1
PE	829	Ancient people would probably think that we are like magicians . 	0
PE	830	As we know , there are impoverished or disabled people in every society , needing help and support from others . 	0
PE	831	However , I would argue that citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax . 	1
PE	832	Although these workers do not produce profit directly , what they do is for the well-being of the whole society . 	0
PE	833	The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors , such as teachers and police officers . 	0
PE	834	For example , a large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability , so that every one can work and live in a peaceful environment . 	0
PE	835	To start with , all people who are able to work should pay tax to the government , as it is the most important source of government ' s revenue , which is mainly used to serve all citizens . 	1
PE	836	Personally , I tend to disagree with this view . 	0
PE	837	Some people believe that they have made enough contribution to the country by doing that . 	0
PE	838	Paying taxes is the obligation of citizens in almost every country . 	0
PE	839	Paying taxes is enough contribution from citizens 	0
PE	840	In conclusion , it is indeed evident that age limit should be set for retirement . 	1
PE	841	There will come a certain time when the older generation should hand over the responsibility to the fresh comers who are certainly waiting to be given a choice to prove themselves . 	0
PE	842	Their invaluable experiences and knowledge in their respective fields such as engineering , medicine , and law can certainly be beneficial to the younger generation . 	0
PE	843	Hence , it is highly recommended that the retiree come over to the companies or hospitals to have regular sessions with the present staffs to bridge the gap between them and to pass on their knowledge . 	0
PE	844	Thus , it would indeed be better if at an older age , opportunities are given to the younger ones . 	1
PE	845	Admittedly , the expertise of the senior workers who had retired should never be underestimated . 	1
PE	846	Consequently , they will not be able to give their best in whatever they are doing . 	0
PE	847	Besides , the academic institution will have to pay for his medical bills , resulting in more loss for the institution . 	0
PE	848	Beyond that age , a large proportion of them have an elevated chance of contracting a multitude of health problems such as stress related diseases and cardiovascular illnesses . 	0
PE	849	To cite an example , the stressful life that an aged teacher goes through will definitely take a toll on him . 	0
PE	850	In my hometown , I have a lot of friends and good relationships , I love the traffic in here , and the environment is wonderful . 	1
PE	851	I prefer to spend my entire live in one place which is my hometown . 	1
PE	852	Some people may prefer to live in different places at different time because of many reasons such as looking for better job , house , community and so on . 	0
PE	853	Staying in one place is better than moving number of places 	0
PE	854	If anyone needs help , his neighbor will help as much as possible . 	1
PE	855	Every people in my town have known each others , and we have good relationships . 	0
PE	856	In here , I have a lot of friends , and we usually spend free time to play sports like soccer , basketball and of course we have a lot of fun . 	0
PE	857	I was born and grew up in here , a small town . 	0
PE	858	I want to live here because I love the traffic system in here . 	1
PE	859	Nowhere else can give me some people like in here . 	0
PE	860	Their notion should be inspirational in such a way which makes our society educative and increase our literacy rate . 	0
PE	861	I believe that they are important somehow , but not essential . 	1
PE	862	However , while people view these sportive events as vital in release international problems , others think that they are just entertainment to distract people . 	0
PE	863	Moreover , these sports events are not essential in other issues such as politics or other international affairs . 	1
PE	864	For example , the football world cup taking place every four years is a very followed event during which everyone is having fun . 	0
PE	865	In conclusion , although letting languages spoken by ethnic minorities be extinct seems to be very beneficial , it will definitely impact seriously on many other aspects especially in the loss of our cultural heritages . 	1
PE	866	Therefore , saving the use of that kinds of languages in this case generally is the most important element of the cultural diversity ' s preservation . 	0
PE	867	On one hand , governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands . 	0
PE	868	Specifically , price control institution has been used in plenty of social areas , for example , in the farming products and in the real estate area ; however , whether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated . 	0
PE	869	On the other hand , pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil , chemical pollutants , extra lights , also constitute considerable amount of pollution . 	0
PE	870	Consequently , it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly . 	1
PE	871	As we read newspapers or watch TV , we have always been attracted by environmental problems such as traffic issues , air and water pollution questions . 	0
PE	872	Growing traffic and pollution can be controlled by increasing petrol prices 	0
PE	873	As the impacts for those pollution and traffic issues are extremely far-reaching , it is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems , though it is a promising method discussed in the contemporary society . 	1
PE	874	Initiatives should be taken to address the specific problems . 	0
PE	875	As illustrated before , several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems . 	1
PE	876	In addition , the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace , resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours . 	0
PE	877	In short , I can say for certain that spending money on improving public transportation is necessary because it is the key to protect our world , creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in . 	1
PE	878	It means that by using public transports , the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads , which is always full of fumes . 	0
PE	879	Last but not least , using public transportation is much safer than private transportation . 	0
PE	880	According to National Safety Council , riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care . 	0
PE	881	Thus there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation , a healthy , safe and economical way of transporting . 	1
PE	882	Alternative forms of transport to alleviate traffic congestion 	0
PE	883	Recently , a great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation . 	0
PE	884	Some state that automobile is the most convenient transportation , while others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution . 	0
PE	885	In my opinion , I strongly agree that alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced . 	1
PE	886	In this essay , several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages . 	0
PE	887	Firstly , an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution . 	0
PE	888	Since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air , the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants . 	0
PE	889	Therefore , it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles . 	1
PE	890	Secondly , an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion . 	0
PE	891	Once we get into the traffic jam , it forces us to waste our time for a while . 	0
PE	892	If they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins , it is so easy for them . 	0
PE	893	Criminals should be punished for their misdeeds . 	0
PE	894	Second , learning abilities in each students is different . 	0
PE	895	If teachers pay attention to specific students , their work might not finish on time , and this might make many student miss some field in topics that they should know . 	0
PE	896	Some students might understand all topics that they had learnt but some are not . 	0
PE	897	It is not possible that they all comprehend all lessons in the same period of time . 	0
PE	898	This problems depend on how hard study they do . 	0
PE	899	Therefore , testing result are different . 	0
PE	900	Still , I an firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my sentiment are much more tenable and cogent . 	0
PE	901	Thus , teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get . 	1
PE	902	In other words , students can procure more advantages from better facilities . 	1
PE	903	Based on the reasons demonstrate above , I believe that improving facilities is the best way for school because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the other . 	1
PE	904	It is not teachers fault . 	0
PE	905	No one has the right to take the life of a human ; even if he committed murder . 	0
PE	906	It is undeniable that the rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being . 	0
PE	907	For instance , some lecturers in our university read the same text in the reference books for that particular course module . 	0
PE	908	Further , they didn ' t explain the contents in order to understand by the students . 	0
PE	909	Therefore , I strongly agree that going to classes should be optional for the students . 	1
PE	910	To begin with , going to classes are sometimes waste of the time . 	1
PE	911	Some students believe that they should be required to attend classes while others believe that it is an optional for the students . 	0
PE	912	According to my opinion , because it is university level of education , students have enough maturity to choose their choice . 	1
PE	913	Going to classes should be optional for the students 	0
PE	914	University students have different opinion about their attendance to class . 	0
PE	915	It was waste of the time . 	0
PE	916	Because the university students have grown up , they have enough ability to read and understand the text book . 	1
PE	917	Recent investigations reveal that toxic foods are sold pervasively in today ' s market . 	0
PE	918	Also , overpopulation may make people suffer from infectious deseases , especially cough , sneezing and illness . 	0
PE	919	Furthermore , historic buildings make our lives more colorful , provide places for citizens to relax bodies and minds . 	1
PE	920	Depending on the study of Capital Palace , researchers have a comprehensive understanding of the history and the culture . 	0
PE	921	Our governments will be happy with those efficient consequences , and a majority of cities also can imitate this economical cycle . 	0
PE	922	There are many historic buildings , such as Beijing Place , Shanghai Artist Museum , they are all able to support themselves financially by charging tens of thousands of tourists . 	0
PE	923	Meanwhile , historic buildings can be a source of maintenance fees . 	1
PE	924	Lying under the roof of a historic building or sitting on the desk fill with history are both easy ways to forget life ' s little annoyance and feel peaceful . 	0
PE	925	Life in Big Cities Vs People ' s health 	0
PE	926	Today , more and more people are moving to big cities to live . 	0
PE	927	However , while life in those cities is good in some ways , I completely argue that people ' s health would therefore be affected negatively . 	1
PE	928	Environment pollution one of the primary reasons why life in cities is becoming worse than ever before . 	1
PE	929	Exhaust from transportation , especially cars , and factories ' tosix fumes can lead people to face with various respiratory deseases . 	0
PE	930	Besides , water pollution makes people ' s health become more critical . 	0
PE	931	The fact is that dangerous bacterias and germs in polluted water can go indirectly into people ' s bodies and create severe problems , which may result in death if the patients are not treated in time . 	0
PE	932	Moreover , it is likely that many foods in big cities are not safe for people to eat or drink . 	1
PE	933	They are essential to our spiritual life . 	0
PE	934	They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way . 	0
PE	935	Second , music and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing . 	0
PE	936	Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies , music and art still bring out children ' s joy of flying in imagination . 	0
PE	937	If parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer , that might be too much . 	0
PE	938	In my opinion , it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like . 	0
PE	939	However , some people might argue that parents shouldn ' t put so much stress on children , since learning too many skills seems to be a burden for them . 	1
PE	940	Therefore , even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists , learning music and art is still worthy because it can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure . 	1
PE	941	In this way , it will not be such pressure on children . 	0
PE	942	In a child stage , music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills . 	0
PE	943	It is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities . 	0
PE	944	In addition , the policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam . 	0
PE	945	Obviously , the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth . 	1
PE	946	Whereas , if there are more good buses , trains , or subways , people are inclined to use less private vehicles , which decreases the amount of carbon released . 	0
PE	947	In conclusion , I would concede that high-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around . 	1
PE	948	There is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion . 	0
PE	949	In order to tackle the problem , governments have to turn people ' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes . 	1
PE	950	The main reason for this issue is that there are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads . 	0
PE	951	They not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere . 	1
PE	952	Nevertheless , public transportation systems even have more important advantages . 	1
PE	953	Some people might argue that economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside . 	1
PE	954	Environmental issues can not be divided by nationality because all humans are simply entwined together by our only home-Earth . 	0
PE	955	However , the truth is that we ' ve been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now . 	0
PE	956	They may say that if the economic is in a very bad situation , people would revolt instantly , while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away . 	0
PE	957	Environmental problems are global rather than local , which means that no countries can be spared from these problems . 	0
PE	958	Second , the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues . 	1
PE	959	The melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region , but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator , since the rising sea water could drown them . 	0
PE	960	Take global warming for example , when the temperature increases , the whole globe is affected , suffering the hotter weather together . 	0
PE	961	In conclusion , environmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence . 	1
PE	962	It would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately , usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages . 	0
PE	963	Furthermore , it also have potentially harm for human ' s health without any testing . 	0
PE	964	Thus even if they are volunteers ; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines . 	0
PE	965	To sum up , I reaffirm that although there is some disadvantages of animals ' profits , the merits of animal experiments still outweigh the demerits . 	1
PE	966	One of the difficulties was some of his histories , such as Mickey Mouse and Three Little Pigs , were turned down . 	0
PE	967	He heard lots of " no " , furthermore one editor fired him alleging that he had no imagination , after all what he had gone through , he never stop chasing his dreams . 	0
PE	968	It is possible to get frustrate along the way , but it is vital to never give up on your dream . 	1
PE	969	To illustrate , Walt Disney , whose career is famous , had a challenging life . 	0
PE	970	To conclude , in this competitive world you have to be fearless and face all new situations . 	1
PE	971	Even though sometimes you consider backing down and stay in the same routine that you are used to , it is necessary to have courage to take risks , be different and pursue your dream to have a successful life . 	1
PE	972	After having considered all the problems that I have discussed above , we can finally draw a conclusion that although mobile phones brings convenience of communication , they also contribute to some social problems . 	1
PE	973	Therefore , mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication . 	1
PE	974	However , other people may perceive this issue from different viewpoint . 	0
PE	975	Therefore , the hardship of communication may be developed . 	1
PE	976	For instance , as lots of chatting apps available online such as " Weichat " , people tend to send instant messages free of charge by using their phones rather than face to face communication . 	0
PE	977	With rapid development of the internet , people are able to enjoy quick electronic communication via internet . 	0
PE	978	Vehicle technology enables many people to drive private cars , and emission of exhaust gas could lead to air pollution in large cities . 	0
PE	979	In conclusion , although technological progress causes corresponding problems , it still provides us with much more advantages . 	1
PE	980	People utilize architecture technology to construct buildings to expand urban areas , and fuel companies apply drilling technology to extract a great amount of fossil oil in natural regions . 	0
PE	981	This would pose a large threat to the ecology and environment . 	0
PE	982	In conclusion , I agree that IT discoveries are likely to have more disadvantages than benefits and people should know how to use their developments properly . 	1
PE	983	In conclusion , students can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes . 	1
PE	984	Besides , even if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors , they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates . 	0
PE	985	I believe that professors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors . 	0
PE	986	However , in my opinion , this is a rather immodest way of thinking . 	0
PE	987	Doesn ' t self-study more efficient ? 	0
PE	988	Why wasting time going to classes ? 	0
PE	989	Some people might argue that if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own . 	1
PE	990	Those who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn ' t show up in the classes . 	0
PE	991	In other words , class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances . 	1
PE	992	Many professors grade their students with class attendances . 	0
PE	993	In the modern world , computers are used everywhere . 	0
PE	994	Ever since Charles Babbage ( know as " Father of computers " ) invented computers , its development never had a pause . 	0
PE	995	Computer-a device which has given a whole new dimension to the human life . 	0
PE	996	But today , it can be sent in few minutes by typing a email and few clicks . 	0
PE	997	For example , in earlier days , if one had to send a message to someone in other country , it used to take months . 	0
PE	998	After I watch the soccer match between Korea and Japan , the stress was gone . 	0
PE	999	So , I was quite aggressive , however . 	0
PE	1000	In addition , Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses . 	1
PE	1001	Using those education programs let people get a lot of inspirations instead of having negative effects . 	0
PE	1002	Also , there are many documentary films such as the life of a great man in Korea . 	0
PE	1003	We can study subjects through EBS lecture . 	0
PE	1004	As an example , I got too much stress from the school . 	0
PE	1005	When they are watching sports programs , it ' s easy to relieve those stresses . 	0
PE	1006	Many children have a lot of stresses recently , since they have so much pressure about study . 	0
PE	1007	There are many Tv programs such as sports programs . 	0
PE	1008	However , I believe their concern is groundless . 	0
PE	1009	Instead , technology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles . 	1
PE	1010	In terms of time and space , technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life . 	1
PE	1011	In the past , only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles . 	0
PE	1012	Technology keeps traditional skills and ways of life alive or not ? 	0
PE	1013	Living in the 21st century , people are firmly convinced that technology is the main driving force behind productivity . 	0
PE	1014	Thus , every country has been promoting technological advances in the recent years , regardless of any potential problems it may bring about . 	0
PE	1015	Some people are worried modern technological technology is probably a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles . 	0
PE	1016	This means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills . 	0
PE	1017	However , with the access to the Internet , one of the greatest innovations in modern society , humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime , anywhere . 	0
PE	1018	Childhood , in several aspects , is the happiest period of our lives . 	1
PE	1019	In adulthood , people are forced to express themselves in boundaries , therefore they are in no way free to think or use their imagination . 	0
PE	1020	In an ideal world with less boundaries , social judgement and more freedom of thought , things could be different ; but since this is not the case , it seems that we will always be missing our childhood days . 	0
PE	1021	It ' s not only because of the nature of childhood and children , but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults . 	1
PE	1022	Therefore , childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most . 	1
PE	1023	There are lots of new facts you can learn , stories you can listen to and things you can see . 	0
PE	1024	Children are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults , and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination . 	0
PE	1025	Using your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child . 	1
PE	1026	Although exploring space used for discovery of other planets , nowadays most of governments have used many rockets for military purposes and therefore the purposes of exploring space has altered . 	0
PE	1027	In summary , spending budget for space exploring is not the waste budget , because it may helps to save civilization of humanity . 	1
PE	1028	As a result , space exploration will use as a military power for many countries . 	1
PE	1029	Both countries tried to send man to the moon and show their power to each other . 	0
PE	1030	In the past , the space race happened between the United Stated and the Soviet Union . 	0
PE	1031	It not only has the advantage of working with colleges but also it provides a real working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home . 	1
PE	1032	Moreover , people who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office , like some announcements from the boss . 	0
PE	1033	In conclusion , working in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency . 	1
PE	1034	It ' s hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away . 	0
PE	1035	In addition , while people are working at home , there will be no one supervising them , thus raises the chance of loafing . 	0
PE	1036	Second , working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works . 	1
PE	1037	For example , people are easily distracted while working at home . 	0
PE	1038	Thus , I firmly believe that both genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers . 	1
PE	1039	People benefit more from coming computers into their lives . 	1
PE	1040	It ' s more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone . 	0
PE	1041	For another example , if one ’ s computer or Internet has any breakdown , he / she can call the MIS staff to fix . 	0
PE	1042	In my opinion , I believe that working at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office . 	1
PE	1043	First of all , while working in the office , people can interact with their colleges instantly . 	1
PE	1044	They can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together . 	0
PE	1045	Think about the big project that a group is working on , if any group member has new idea about the project , he / she can assemble his / her colleges right away and discuss . 	0
PE	1046	Working at home vs Working in a company 	0
PE	1047	Due to the convenience of current technology , people can do their works everywhere as long as they have the equipment around them . 	0
PE	1048	People are no longer restricted in the office . 	0
PE	1049	This rapid progress in technology leads to the question whether it ' s better working at home with a computer and a phone than working at the company ' s office . 	0
PE	1050	Some people might say I am silly , but I think mistake is more forgettable than friendship . 	1
PE	1051	However , I forgot about it just after two days , and I felt at peace with him . 	0
PE	1052	However , if you end a friendship whenever your friend makes a mistake , there will be no friends around you . 	0
PE	1053	Second , Everybody makes mistake . 	1
PE	1054	However , when the mistake friend made was not a big problem , we need to understand friend and forgive it because a friend is a gift of our life . 	0
PE	1055	I agree if a friend makes very a big mistake , we will need to end a friendship . 	0
PE	1056	I think that a mistake can not brake friendship if it is not a big because friendship is forever and gift our life . 	1
PE	1057	According to a research , 85% of people answered that a best gift is a friend . 	0
PE	1058	In conclusion , the above stated reasons clearly outweigh the fact that cars cause a lot of pollution because they provide flexibility , which is important in nearly all areas of life . 	1
PE	1059	Personally , I agree with this statement . 	0
PE	1060	First , the core of group working is " consensus " . 	1
PE	1061	It ' s the idea that everyone ’ s opinion accounts . 	0
PE	1062	In group works , group members gather together to have brain-storming discussion , think over every possible solutions and then finally reach an agreement . 	0
PE	1063	People who can ’ t accept others ’ criticism can ’ t succeed in group working 	0
PE	1064	In everyday life we encounter different people , and we receive different opinions about us or our works , no matter positive or negative . 	0
PE	1065	It might be easy to take praises but hard to accept criticism . 	0
PE	1066	Therefore , here goes the point that people who can ' t accept others ' criticism can ' t succeed in group working . 	1
PE	1067	In this long process of discussion , there must be different opinions sparkling out . 	0
PE	1068	It doesn ' t work if one member solely insists on his / her idea and doesn ' t take other member ' s criticism because the work belongs to every member , not a personal show for specific one member . 	0
PE	1069	The reason for this is traditional education has its stand for most appropriate method . 	1
PE	1070	Although , it is agreed that learning by watching TV is more effective to some children , I find it difficult not to oppose against the idea of having students spend more time on TVs . 	0
PE	1071	Education is undeniably pivotal for an individual . 	0
PE	1072	How to learn children more efficiently 	0
PE	1073	The purpose of education is always a controversial topic among people and society , especially in high level such as college or university . 	0
PE	1074	Technology and its advance , to some degrees , have influenced the educational industry positively . 	0
PE	1075	To begin with , classic teaching methods has been scientifically proven and utilized as the best mode of educate a child . 	0
PE	1076	Thus , physical inactivity should not be encouraged for the aim of bettering youngsters ' skills . 	1
PE	1077	Yet , monitors are unable to replace the appearance of educators since their knowledge and adaptability is priceless . 	0
PE	1078	The fact that students nowadays do their homework or researches on computers rather than go to libraries is an illustration for this . 	0
PE	1079	Some people argue that this may lead to ' social division ' , when someone with high education refuses to do the called ' low jobs ' , but actually it gives no harm to the whole community . 	0
PE	1080	Secondly , university should only accept good students because it gives better human resources for sophisticated purposes . 	1
PE	1081	I am a kind of person who believes to children should learn to manage their own money at a young age , due to reasons that I stated below . 	1
PE	1082	From my perspective , the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways because of three crucial reasons . 	1
PE	1083	Many countries have suffered from pollution , noisy and casualty for a long time . 	0
PE	1084	The population explosion results in the high demands of transportation . 	0
PE	1085	Government should regard investing in building roads as the most important 	0
PE	1086	Most importantly , there are many accidents happening on the roads . 	0
PE	1087	Moreover , the sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing . 	0
PE	1088	The buses , cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia . 	0
PE	1089	First and foremost , we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents . 	1
PE	1090	Each year , Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan . 	0
PE	1091	For example , in my country , buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents . 	0
PE	1092	To sum up , I believe that a higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder-working employees . 	1
PE	1093	Alternatively , providing a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity since they will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses . 	1
PE	1094	It ’ s certainly better for children to grow up in a big city . 	1
PE	1095	Modern cooking methods have improved our life-style significantly 	0
PE	1096	With technology advances , food has become easier to prepare in modern days . 	0
PE	1097	People now can use kitchen appliances such as microwave and toaster to cook their meals easier and more convenient than before . 	0
PE	1098	Also , instant food products take only a few minutes to be made into delicious meals . 	0
PE	1099	These changes make cooking so easy-to-use and time-saving as to improve the way we live to a great extent . 	1
PE	1100	First of all , people have more chance to do other activities they like since food preparation is no longer time-consuming . 	1
PE	1101	For instance , such a change has liberated many housewives from tedious cooking process and gave them additional time to do something more meaningful like accompanying family or doing a job . 	0
PE	1102	On the other hand , more people can sleep a bit later to go to work because they only need a couple of time to prepare for the breakfasts . 	0
PE	1103	At the second point , since food preparation has become easier and more convenient , it is certainly great to preserve diverse kinds of foods at home . 	1
PE	1104	People can have a variety of dishes even in a small meal and choose whatever they like . 	0
PE	1105	In conclusion , International sporting events will draw the international concern . 	1
PE	1106	Everythings is created by patriotic emotions of Chinese who wanted to bring a beautiful China to the world . 	0
PE	1107	It will make the world more peaceful by easing internation tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way . 	1
PE	1108	For this point , they all think that the very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure . 	0
PE	1109	Another function that all zoos serve relates to education . 	0
PE	1110	Some people spot out that humanities benefit so much from zoos . 	1
PE	1111	First of all , zoos are fascinating places of entertainment . 	0
PE	1112	Zoos have been established for ages all over the world and have become interesting places for entertainment . 	0
PE	1113	Over the time , there are also a lot of arguments concerning whether zoos are helpful in serving people or they are just some kinds of bad treatments to animals . 	0
PE	1114	Do zoos serve any useful function ? 	0
PE	1115	It has become quite a common hobby of children that they usually spend their free time in zoos . 	0
PE	1116	They are responsible to take care of everything including paying their apartment rent on time , and dealing with the utility bills . 	0
PE	1117	In addition , students also have to focus on their study , and try to maintain their grades higher . 	0
PE	1118	Furthermore , students also have a chance to know about the community around them . 	0
PE	1119	Interacting with the people , and socializing with them prepares students for the life after graduation . 	0
PE	1120	From given the evidences , it seems to me that it becomes hard for students to choose between their living options since both living accommodation have its own benefits . 	1
PE	1121	If I have to choose , I would definitely choose the second option : living in an apartment . 	1
PE	1122	I think that it teaches me everything that I certainly wants to learn in my life because learning all those characteristics would really help me in leading successful life . 	1
PE	1123	Moreover , some zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct . 	0
PE	1124	Test-wise candidates can often perform well on exams without having good underlying knowledge or skills . 	0
PE	1125	In contrast , some test-takers perform cannot achieve a satisfying result because of anxiety . 	0
PE	1126	" Pen and Paper " Examination 	0
PE	1127	Examinations are one of the most common methods of measuring learning in education systems throughout the world . 	0
PE	1128	At virtually every stage of the learning process , exams are used to verify that the learner is ready to move on to the next stage . 	0
PE	1129	However , many believe that the role of examinations should be reconsidered . 	0
PE	1130	There are clearly advantages to exams . 	1
PE	1131	They help to ensure fairness by imposing the same conditions on all exam candidates . 	0
PE	1132	They are also relatively versatile ; different types of exam questions , for example , multiple-choice questions and essay tasks , can test different sorts of reasoning ability . 	0
PE	1133	However , exams also have some drawbacks . 	1
PE	1134	The reasons to be illustrated are follows . 	0
PE	1135	However , from my perspective , students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing exam . 	1
PE	1136	For example , I love Physics . 	0
PE	1137	Firstly , the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject . 	1
PE	1138	Though out the last decade , the load of the university students has been constantly increasing . 	0
PE	1139	It is not necessary for university students to attend classes 	0
PE	1140	There are those who said that student can attend the university coarse without passing the exam . 	0
PE	1141	There are those who consider that university students cannot attend any classes until the students pass the exam . 	0
PE	1142	And I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics . 	0
PE	1143	But I don ' t like electronics , because electronics cannot always be seen in the real world . 	0
PE	1144	Things have changed a lot . 	0
PE	1145	I grow up in a better condition than my father did . 	0
PE	1146	In the past , seldom people have the chance to attend a collage . 	0
PE	1147	For example , my grandparents did not get a education even in high school , so when my father had difficulty in solving a problem in his childhood , he had to go to his teacher for help . 	0
PE	1148	What is more , family members can help us in many other aspects . 	1
PE	1149	For example , when I did not know what major to choose when I attend university , my father told a lot about different majors . 	0
PE	1150	Whenever I have problems , I can always ask my parents for help . 	0
PE	1151	They can solve the problem quickly because they have learned quite a lot . 	0
PE	1152	What is more , the factory is not isolated , other industries and business will be quickly established , resulting in economic growth of local area . 	0
PE	1153	To manufacture goods , there must be the demand of laborers , from which the local residents can benefit . 	0
PE	1154	He shared his own experience with me , which helped me quite a lot . 	0
PE	1155	Parents are quite experienced than their child , they can guide them toward the right direction . 	0
PE	1156	However a vast number of people are against building a factory near their community because of pollution . 	0
PE	1157	Out of the case of economic development , industrial buildings are a necessary part of modern society . 	0
PE	1158	Nowadays , whether to establish large factories nearby housing areas has become a controversial issue in our society . 	0
PE	1159	Influence of large factories 	0
PE	1160	Through part-time job , she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life . 	0
PE	1161	My friend Lisa , who is doing part-time job now , tells me that it is fabulous to take it . 	0
PE	1162	Because most people they contact with are also students . 	0
PE	1163	First , there are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university . 	0
PE	1164	So , they can teach students many things about adult life . 	1
PE	1165	However , when students do part-time jobs , they can work with many kinds of people , and most of whom are adults . 	0
PE	1166	Nowadays , the difference between school and society is bigger and bigger . 	0
PE	1167	The part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it 	0
PE	1168	There are some reasons can support my view . 	0
PE	1169	If students want to get used to the society quickly , it is better for parents to encourage them to take part-time jobs . 	1
PE	1170	To conclude , I would say that people should create a sense of co-operation in their children to make them feel more accomplished in life . 	1
PE	1171	Consequently , the calm atmosphere in the class might be created . 	0
PE	1172	In fact , students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music . 	0
PE	1173	Moreover , if musical activity involves many participants , there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group , which is , of course , beneficial in their future life . 	0
PE	1174	In this case , music can be a useful and interesting solution . 	0
PE	1175	I have an impression that students , who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time . 	0
PE	1176	Therefore , many university authorities provide music lessons for their students so that they live and study in a harmony with music . 	1
PE	1177	It is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology . 	0
PE	1178	In this essay I will give my opinion for both sides . 	0
PE	1179	Most people claim that in high school music must be taught as a main subject , while others say that this is an unnecessary subject and should at least be optional . 	0
PE	1180	Should high school make music lessons compulsory 	0
PE	1181	I can prepare my schedules , guidelines , exercises and go over them all . 	0
PE	1182	For instance , I am a type of person who cannot comprehend my subjects unless I am alone . 	0
PE	1183	Studying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons . 	1
PE	1184	Yet , I prefer to study individually because it helps me to concentrate more , and it helps me to build my personality . 	1
PE	1185	Some students benefit a lot when they study with groups . 	0
PE	1186	At school or university , success depends on how we study . 	0
PE	1187	Everyone has their method to success in life . 	0
PE	1188	Some students prefer to study alone 	0
PE	1189	In my opinion , I can take advantage of every minute without wasting by studying alone . 	0
PE	1190	Moreover , we have a lot of subjects which require us to sit and study alone such as math , reading , and drawing . 	0
PE	1191	Although some people argue that children should be free to spend money to they what they want , In my opinion it is very important to learn our children from their beginning of their life to be financially responsible persons , because our personality form in childhood and it is not easy to change it in adulthood . 	1
PE	1192	Many old traditionally cultural things have long gone as a result of modern technology . 	1
PE	1193	For instance , factories equipped with new and highly-productive system has replaced old handmade products , the exchange of letters among friends is so hard to be seen as we have had emails and social network instead , new video games has superseded the old-physical ones . 	0
PE	1194	However , these newfangled practices has replaced many old traditional ones . 	0
PE	1195	The invention of mobile phone and internet has changed our traditional ways of communicating as well as working , it has also been much less labourous than in the pass with the assistance of electrical machineries . 	0
PE	1196	Thanks to modern technology , our life has been improved with many gadgets . 	1
PE	1197	While there is belief that technology advances means a lost in traditional cultures , I would argue that although the affect of technology on culture is undeniable , it has also contributed to the preservation of traditonal culture . 	1
PE	1198	Nowadays , technology has been developing significantly , impacting many aspects of our life . 	0
PE	1199	Modern technology has impacted the traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways 	0
PE	1200	Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete . 	0
PE	1201	The athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country . 	0
PE	1202	Internet has aided to assess the young generations to the cultural identity of many nations from all around the world . 	0
PE	1203	However , despite the drawback mentioned above , technology has also made some contributions to the maintenance and study of traditional cultures in some ways . 	1
PE	1204	A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself . 	0
PE	1205	We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success . 	0
PE	1206	Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children . 	0
PE	1207	Co-operation is essential for teamwork . 	1
PE	1208	However , co-operative approach always helps a child to become a responsible adult with good moral values and a friendly social circle . 	0
PE	1209	Some people think that inculcating co-operative approach in a child is essential while some think that competing is the best way to succeed . 	0
PE	1210	The modern society is full of cut-throat competition . 	0
PE	1211	Competition or co-operation-which is better 	0
PE	1212	It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy . 	0
PE	1213	For instance , lions hunt in a team . 	0
PE	1214	Besides , when we practice outdoors and indoors sports , many aspects are getting clearer . 	1
PE	1215	For example , when a person goes jogging everyday , eventually he can understand his own body through direct observation . 	0
PE	1216	Physical exercises help to create healthy nation , assist to learning through direct observation and finally aid to financial development of a country . 	1
PE	1217	First of all , the ancient Latin proverb says : " Anima sana in corpore sano " , which means that healthy body is basis for healthy soul . 	0
PE	1218	Physical exercise 	0
PE	1219	Although some people think that the major part of school schedule should be entirely devoted to academics , I truly believe that the physical education part should not be outweighed . 	1
PE	1220	Additionally , there is a fact that one can improve health conditions with everyday physical activity : gradually , step by step we change physical condition to better . 	0
PE	1221	So , if the entire nation , from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday , eventually it may help to build healthy nation . 	1
PE	1222	There is a direct linkage between people ' s health and the frequency of doing physical exercises . 	0
PE	1223	The more we practice , the better we feel . 	0
PE	1224	It helps people build a sustainable society where people can live a happy life when they are old . 	1
PE	1225	By way of conclusion , it is true that the development of the health care system helps people have a better life . 	1
PE	1226	They have given their effort to the society so that young people , the governments have a responsibility to improve the Medicare system . 	0
PE	1227	Although it is real in some aspects , I believe that the capital that spend on taking care the elderly is contributed by these people during their working time , so they are worth to have good care . 	0
PE	1228	With newly developing technologies , people are able to carry various tasks more convenient and easy . 	0
PE	1229	This means that girls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent , and they both have better ability in the specific aspect . 	0
PE	1230	Furthermore , it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender , and that does not conform to students ' personality traits and mental development . 	1
PE	1231	Most of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act , and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases . 	0
PE	1232	For instance , there are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world . 	0
PE	1233	Many boys are interested in science and technology , while a number of girls like to learn literature , education and arts . 	0
PE	1234	Besides , girls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication , such as teacher , singer and interpreter . 	0
PE	1235	We can not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject 	0
PE	1236	There is a view that universities and colleges should equally enroll male and female students in numbers in each faculty . 	0
PE	1237	Personally , I do not agree the viewpoint , because many different characters exist between male and female students . 	1
PE	1238	On one hand , boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality . 	1
PE	1239	Nonetheless , innovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience . 	1
PE	1240	It helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments . 	0
PE	1241	Hence , creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions . 	1
PE	1242	Time and again , creative artists like Michaelangelo , Picasso , Salman Rushdie , Shakespeare etc . have made artistic works which gave a social message . 	0
PE	1243	Right from sculptures to paintings , books to drama and movies , all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras . 	0
PE	1244	Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message . 	1
PE	1245	Creativity - should it be given freedom or restrictions 	0
PE	1246	Creativity is the ability to think beyond the obvious . 	0
PE	1247	Many governments restrict the artistic works of the creative minds . 	0
PE	1248	Creativity originates in a free mind . 	1
PE	1249	Many people think they are blessed to be in the era of high technology . 	0
PE	1250	We definitely do not want our children to spend money on luxurious custom or lifestyle just to be similar to someone , especially when these people are not symbols of any talent but showing off . 	0
PE	1251	However , the young generation these days is very conscious toward positive lifestyles . 	0
PE	1252	They are mostly being educated at very early ages by family or schools as to distinguish what is benefit for them . 	0
PE	1253	Therefore , it is not easy to influence young people these days when they are well equipped of life skills . 	1
PE	1254	Celebrities & Their Influences 	0
PE	1255	Some people argue that adolescents are being influenced badly by untalented people who become famous thanks to their luxurious lifestyle and wealth . 	0
PE	1256	To some extent , I do not agree with this statement . 	0
PE	1257	First of all , it is true that people use their money to become an inspiration are definitely not a good mirror for young people . 	1
PE	1258	Moreover , it seems to me that not many people can exist in the celebrities ' world without any talents or achievements . 	0
PE	1259	We are giving chances to many teenagers to show their intelligence in different talent shows , for example ; The Voice , X Factor or Next Top Models etc . As a result , to become a star and an inspiration for people , a person need to have real talent to compete with other candidates . 	0
PE	1260	When we talk about student , we generally mean a boy or a girl who study in school or college . 	0
PE	1261	Part time job for teenage students 	0
PE	1262	However , some people do not support the concept of teenagers doing job beside study . 	0
PE	1263	In some country , teenage students have the opportunity to do some part time job beside their study . 	0
PE	1264	The main reason is that students can learn lots of things from part time job , before starting their real job . 	1
PE	1265	In my view , it is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he / she is still a student and this is for two reasons . 	1
PE	1266	For example , when I was in my high school I worked as a sales-man in a shop for a year . 	0
PE	1267	Students can learn about time management , money management and convince people by their words . 	0
PE	1268	I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework . 	0
PE	1269	As i had to spend some of my time in my job , therefore , i had to manage my time efficiently . 	0
PE	1270	Of course , new technologies are always great . 	1
PE	1271	Who would the employer choose , an old man with old-fashioned education and a young man who is not only good at fundermentaly subject , but also knows how to program or how to speak foreign languages . 	0
PE	1272	Last but not least , knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor to help young workers outrank the elderly . 	1
PE	1273	They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also . 	0
PE	1274	For example , nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky . 	0
PE	1275	However , in my point of view , it is still of great importance to remain the harmonious coexistence of both sides for the smooth sailing of the company . 	1
PE	1276	All in a nutshell , workers over 50 have proven themselves subordinate to the following generation in all aspects . 	1
PE	1277	Not to undermine old workers , but their lack of authority over such basically required fields in this day and age leads to their incompetence in every modern workplace . 	0
PE	1278	This factor is still affecting thinking of many people . 	0
PE	1279	Contrastingly , in the past time , women worked at home and performed sophisticated work . 	0
PE	1280	Nowadays men and women are equally participating in every field . 	0
PE	1281	Gender Equality at university admission 	0
PE	1282	Initially , if we look into the fact , women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor . 	0
PE	1283	Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders . 	1
PE	1284	This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender . 	0
PE	1285	They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only . 	0
PE	1286	There are couple reasons and examples to support my answer . 	0
PE	1287	In doing so crime can be eliminated from a nation and it is a responsibility of every individual to be in the favor of truth and respect the laws of our constitution . 	0
PE	1288	To conclude , Government should decide for punishment case by case basis . 	1
PE	1289	Not only because there is no machine for the work , but also it looks more beautiful when it is made by hand , so resulting in greater value economy . 	0
PE	1290	For instance , making cone hats from leaves have to use hand . 	0
PE	1291	Traditional skills and ways of life will help youngsters study and know more history . 	1
PE	1292	The last thing is about education . 	0
PE	1293	Lot of people like to use traditional things because if their quality and durability . 	0
PE	1294	In addition , in some cases that traditional way can not replace by a new technology . 	1
PE	1295	Futhermore , there are plenty of works that using traditional way is unique method . 	0
PE	1296	In paticular , vases are made by hand would be used more . 	0
PE	1297	After that , they might create somethings that are useful for life . 	0
PE	1298	Methods which their ancestors used in the past will be displayed again for new generations . 	0
PE	1299	Indeed , their contribution is less important than those from doctors or scientists , albeit necessary . 	0
PE	1300	Hence , their privilege of salary seems groundless , while the main work forces receive modest salaries which only enable them to afford bare necessities . 	1
PE	1301	From all analysis suggested above , professional athletes and singers are overpaid in terms of their contributions . 	1
PE	1302	I think that there should be a modification in the salary of professional singers and athletes to balance with those of people in other fields , namely science and society , who are the driving forces for the prosperity of the nation . 	0
PE	1303	Other people say that singers and athletes , in fact , contribute insignificantly to the development of the society . 	0
PE	1304	It is assumed the amazing performances they give to the audiences are only valuable in aesthetic and entertaining terms . 	0
PE	1305	While scientists invent machines serving daily lives , doctors take care of patients and cure their diseases and policemen help to ensure the safety and stability of the nation , singers and athletes do not play a helpful part in improving the material life . 	0
PE	1306	They commit themselves to promoting relaxation and enjoyment for the audience . 	0
PE	1307	On special dates , city offers free exhibitions which are available for everyone who is interested in art . 	0
PE	1308	I am keen on museums and it would be a pleasure for me to spend several hours a week in front of famous paintings , sculptures or artifacts . 	0
PE	1309	This can at least assure me that if I feel bad , city can provide a high quality help . 	0
PE	1310	What ' s more , cities have better medical facilities than in the countryside . 	1
PE	1311	A night club is an interesting place to visit for young people . 	0
PE	1312	I am fond of Italian food , and if there is an Italian restaurant in the city , I will definitely visit it . 	0
PE	1313	Cultural life of a metropolis is always an entertaining one . 	1
PE	1314	There a person can listen to music , make new friends or enjoy a a drink alone . 	0
PE	1315	All in all , the best way to judge about individuals ' is to be familiar with their personality not with their appearance . 	1
PE	1316	She asked me to stay with her till my parents come , also she was great in hospitality and her behavior was unforgettable . 	0
PE	1317	One day in a cold winter while I was getting back to home from school I realized that I lost my keys , so I could not do anything before my parents getting back home . 	0
PE	1318	Considering all the benefits , I would choose to live in a big city . 	1
PE	1319	In conclusion , while small towns have picturesque nature and pure air , big cities offer countless amount of opportunities and entertainment places . 	1
PE	1320	The result shows that the 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget , while it takes 30 hours for the later one . 	0
PE	1321	The similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other . 	0
PE	1322	An experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity . 	0
PE	1323	The first group was asked to discuss in person , while the second group was asked to discuss by email . 	0
PE	1324	Firstly , team members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently . 	0
PE	1325	Obviously , discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails . 	1
PE	1326	Do you think classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by e-mail 	0
PE	1327	When it comes to the question whether classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by email , I am of the view that wok in person is preferred because this means help to achieve a good communication . 	1
PE	1328	They are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way . 	0
PE	1329	The company will benefit from every worker of excellent knowledge . 	1
PE	1330	The core and most profitable technology of an IT company is invented by a worker with excellent computer knowledge , not a worker with outstanding communicating skill . 	0
PE	1331	Secondly , work in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project because there will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members . 	0
PE	1332	Writing an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official , therefore people who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing . 	0
PE	1333	In a word , the parents can save money , if their children live with them longer . 	1
PE	1334	Beneficial changes will certainly take place if changes are made because for a change to happen , changes have to be done . 	0
PE	1335	This is of paramount importance so that they will be able to give a better and reliable as well as a fair judgment to the convicted . 	1
PE	1336	The third convincing reason is that the young adult needs father and mother ' s suggestions . 	0
PE	1337	If finally he is proven innocent , he may feel embarrassed to face the public . 	0
PE	1338	It is undeniable that when the background of the convicted is ' dug ' deeper and is revealed to mass of anonymous people , his privacy is being jeopardized . 	1
PE	1339	To conclude , I definitely feel that the current way of the juries judging the case should be transformed and they should know the facts about the criminals they are dealing with . 	1
PE	1340	However , I am sure that the crimes done by criminals should be brought to light and the public should be aware of it so that they will not become a victim as well . 	0
PE	1341	Thus , exposing them to the past records of the criminal can give them more room to think rationally and finally put the pieces together in order to produce a more meaningful decision . 	0
PE	1342	As all of us know , juries are a group of people who have no or less knowledge regarding law . 	0
PE	1343	Not only that , the convicted will also receive a fair action . 	1
PE	1344	By doing so , the juries will have a sense of relief that they have come up with better conclusion based on plenty of evidences . 	0
PE	1345	Spending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be . 	0
PE	1346	Learning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home . 	0
PE	1347	Therefore , he may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents . 	0
PE	1348	Thus , I think undergoing with parents is worthwhile . 	1
PE	1349	Furthermore , living at home costs less than living outside . 	0
PE	1350	However , reasonable attentions should be paid to treatment so that our citizens are always looked after with best services . 	1
PE	1351	In conclusion , I strongly agree that we should give more priority to health education and preventative measures than to treatment . 	1
PE	1352	In addition , because the cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention , the government can save a lot of money for our country ' s health budget . 	0
PE	1353	As human resources play a key role in the development of a country , investing money to enhance the general health state is a totally right decision . 	1
PE	1354	When huge injection campaigns are organized throughout our country , the community ' s health state will be improved remarkably . 	0
PE	1355	For example , vaccines will guarantee that pregnant women and their babies are protected from serious infectious diseases such as flu , smallpox , rubella so on . 	0
PE	1356	Preventative measures will help improve general health state of all citizens . 	0
PE	1357	Therefore it is recommended that young people should be educated not to follow these celebrities blindly , rather they should focus on their career so that they may hope for a bright future . 	0
PE	1358	This has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual . 	1
PE	1359	Thus to conclude , it can be said that when young people follow celebrities , it affects their health as well as behavior in a negative way . 	1
PE	1360	So , this example makes it obvious that these glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people . 	1
PE	1361	For instance recently in a poll conducted by an American magazine it was found that most of the parents and teachers complain that teenagers use derogatory words and abusive language at home and at schools . 	0
PE	1362	Adolescents follow not only the make up and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior . 	0
PE	1363	First of all , many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones . 	1
PE	1364	Despite all these positive aspects , I think that the popularity of mobile phones to the young generation is a bad development . 	1
PE	1365	Nowadays , many young people consider mobile phone as the most important thing in their lives as it keeps them constantly organized and it provides much convenience for them to reach out their families and friends . 	0
PE	1366	Popularity of mobile phones to young people 	0
PE	1367	I have spent most of my time trying to reach a higher level to show-off to my friends . 	0
PE	1368	In my college days , I was once addicted to a certain game on my cellular phone . 	0
PE	1369	Similarly , internet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works . 	0
PE	1370	Games and applications installed in phones have occupied much of their time , leaving them lesser time for their studies and other school activities . 	0
PE	1371	Secondly , juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic . 	1
PE	1372	That goal has led me to my lost in interest on doing my homework and I ended up failing one subject in that semester . 	0
PE	1373	However , a movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters . 	0
PE	1374	If they do not try their best , their protection can be halted and waste of money . 	0
PE	1375	In addition , the preservations need a long time to gather , restore all information as well as train in the educational centre . 	0
PE	1376	All people should give a hand to do this better and governments play a vital role on encouraging and distributing those . 	0
PE	1377	In a nutshell , I am convinced that all languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible . 	1
PE	1378	Although governments invest money on doing that , it is hard to gain the good results . 	0
PE	1379	On the other hand , there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages . 	1
PE	1380	These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular . 	0
PE	1381	As evidence of this , there are a few people , particularly the youngsters , do not pay attention on collecting and studying those . 	0
PE	1382	Roles of international sports events 	0
PE	1383	To sum up , if all those factors are contemplated , it is obviously found that there are many solid reasons to support my viewpoint . 	0
PE	1384	Whenever an international sporting occasion like the football World Cup takes place , it attracts millions of people all over the world . 	0
PE	1385	So , from what have been discussed above , I strongly affirm the conclusion that people will spend less time in cooking food . 	1
PE	1386	When you have just few close friends , on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more , but on the other hand they often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours , adding less to your experience . 	1
PE	1387	In sum , although each choice - few close friends or a large number of friends - presents its advantages and its weak points , I think that spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one ' s life . 	1
PE	1388	Growing violence in films has affected youngsters in a negative way ? 	0
PE	1389	It ' s obvious that violent behavior is growing more in films in recent 20 years . 	0
PE	1390	This matter has been considered as a way to advertise a film . 	0
PE	1391	From my point of view , I believe that violence in movies has negative effects on youngsters mostly on their behaviors , emotions & study . 	1
PE	1392	In the first place , children behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best . 	0
PE	1393	Nowadays children are more involved in TV programs . 	0
PE	1394	Imagine an actor who is a child ’ s favorite is doing violent roles . 	0
PE	1395	Therefore , female students are indicated having the same potential and capability as men . 	1
PE	1396	Automatically , the issue stimulates the stakeholders from many places to think what kind of preparations they should take for stabilising the economic growth and the quality life of people . 	1
PE	1397	Meanwhile , human beings are very sensitive , especially of youngsters . 	0
PE	1398	I strongly agree about this statement . 	0
PE	1399	The proportion of women is rising year by year in many parts of the world recently . 	0
PE	1400	Implementing the statue and right of equal education are believed as a sustainable policy that should be held . 	0
PE	1401	Nowadays , there are many institutions that accept the same average number of male and female students in many kinds of course . 	1
PE	1402	The gender issue for getting education needs 	0
PE	1403	The gender issues have been already discussing for many years in order to give solutions for realising the equal proportion of developing human resources . 	0
PE	1404	As sport has become a common passion which passed over every national border , popular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely . 	1
PE	1405	I might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time so for me it is better to leave a voice mail . 	0
PE	1406	I get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems . 	0
PE	1407	Firstly , communicating by e-mail is easy . 	1
PE	1408	There are several reasons to support this idea which I would like to mention in this essay . 	0
PE	1409	Although many people prefer communicating by telephone or face-to-face , personally I believe that communicating by e-mails or voice mails is better . 	1
PE	1410	Communicating via e-mail and voice mail vs Telephone and face-to face 	0
PE	1411	As for me , I work and study at the university and I don ' t have spare time during the day . 	0
PE	1412	Secondly , you can write an e-mail at any time of the day . 	1
PE	1413	In this case it is not so difficult to write an e-mail or to leave a voice mail because even shy people feel themselves more confident . 	0
PE	1414	Many people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with . 	0
PE	1415	Unlike the distance learning that children have few opportunities to discuss with their friends . 	0
PE	1416	Second , classroom learning provides other activities than studying . 	1
PE	1417	Working in group leads to more discussion and more opinion among the class . 	0
PE	1418	Consequently , the discussion class results in expanded children vision and their respect to others roommate ' s ideas . 	0
PE	1419	Although , online classes have many advantages , for me , I prefer traditional learning classes for several reasons . 	1
PE	1420	First , the participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying . 	1
PE	1421	Almost every school develops their online class systems . 	0
PE	1422	One question I always thought about is whether online computer classes should replace classroom learning . 	0
PE	1423	Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom 	0
PE	1424	During these digital age , the online classes has become more interest and more common in the society . 	0
PE	1425	This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming . 	1
PE	1426	Further , government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy . 	0
PE	1427	In the same way , the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution . 	0
PE	1428	To conclude , it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy . 	1
PE	1429	Secondly , the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming . 	1
PE	1430	For example , the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming . 	0
PE	1431	After all , the harmonious society calls for the joint efforts of the government and citizens . 	0
PE	1432	At the same time , citizens available for the both should encourage the government to allocate money to more urgent areas . 	0
PE	1433	Personally , I think the government should fund the deprived for their health care and education , who are the group in real need for the authority ' s help . 	1
PE	1434	Instead , the government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members ' wellbeing , such as soaring crime rate , AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure , which are requiring financial resources from the government to address . 	0
PE	1435	In modern life , zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers . 	1
PE	1436	Besides , recently , zookeepers have also tried their best to make animals feel more comfortable by making artificial landscapes more familiar to the nature , taking care all animals in both feeding and sanity . 	1
PE	1437	On the other hand , there are , however , people who think that zoos just take away freedom of animals . 	1
PE	1438	Being confined , animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented . 	0
PE	1439	In their opinion , zoos are some kind of prisons and it ' s so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons . 	0
PE	1440	From my point of view , I agree with the first group . 	0
PE	1441	Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting . 	1
PE	1442	In this case , the employees know that their company is investing on them for future development of their company . 	0
PE	1443	Secondly , employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained . 	1
PE	1444	Clearly , in company we always have to deal with so many stressful situations such as negotiating with difficult customer , complaining from boss , etc . Therefore , we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends , joking in class , enjoying new knowledge . 	1
PE	1445	Firstly , training time can provide employee interesting time outside working office to refresh their mind . 	0
PE	1446	My arguments for this point are listed follows . 	0
PE	1447	Besides the methods , from my point of view , providing professional training can be effective in encouraging further good work . 	1
PE	1448	It is unquestionable that salary increases and promotions to new positions are very common way to reward employees for good work . 	0
PE	1449	Salary increases and promotions to new positions are not the only ways 	0
PE	1450	For another thing , employees will be very proud of themselves when they are provided training while others don ' t have this opportunity . 	0
PE	1451	So obviously , they will think about develop long term career with their company . 	0
PE	1452	On the one hand , I have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area . 	1
PE	1453	To make it convenient , I will absolutely choose a place to live that is not too far from my workplace . 	0
PE	1454	What ' s more I can save plenty of money on transportation if I choose to live in the city . 	0
PE	1455	On the other hand , life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town . 	1
PE	1456	A more convenient life in a city 	0
PE	1457	There are undeniable advantages to both life in a big city and in a small town . 	0
PE	1458	The former offers more excitement and convenience while the latter offers a cleaner , quieter and often friendlier place to live . 	0
PE	1459	However , despite the advantages of small town life , I prefer to live in a big city for several reasons . 	1
PE	1460	You can enjoy modern life and have more access to the advanced facilities . 	0
PE	1461	For instance , you can visit museums to learn history , and go to a more equipped library to enjoy reading , or you can go to a sports center for exercising . 	0
PE	1462	It is every student ' s desire to study at a good university and experience a new environment . 	0
PE	1463	Living and studying overseas 	0
PE	1464	There will have many disadvantages if the workers work at home . 	1
PE	1465	Interaction is a factor increasing working quality . 	0
PE	1466	Compared to the peers studying in the home country , it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself / herself into new environments and situations in life . 	0
PE	1467	First , studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures . 	1
PE	1468	One who is living overseas will of course struggle with loneliness , living away from family and friends but those difficulties will turn into valuable experiences in the following steps of life . 	0
PE	1469	Second , living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet . 	1
PE	1470	Also , employers are mostly looking for people who have international and language skills . 	0
PE	1471	Moreover , the one will learn living without depending on anyone else . 	0
PE	1472	The dos and don ' t at office play important role to prevent these things from workers . 	0
PE	1473	Facebook or Yahoo have been the entertaining websites , however , they are the reasons why people cannot concentrate on their job . 	0
PE	1474	Besides , interaction help employees improve their communicational skills , therefore , they will have more and more friends and relationships . 	0
PE	1475	Discussing and debating Projects together increase working ability because all we know that the target can be reached fast thanks to working of many people . 	0
PE	1476	Interaction has been an advantage for workers at offices . 	1
PE	1477	The best condition might not be good for people . 	0
PE	1478	Everyone has happy moments during their life . 	0
PE	1479	School memories 	0
PE	1480	In my opinion , childhood is the happiest time of a person ' s life . 	1
PE	1481	These happy moments are both in their childhood and their adulthood . 	0
PE	1482	They do not have to worry about bills , jobs , how would their life be in the future . 	0
PE	1483	First , in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood . 	1
PE	1484	Third , technology has also played a great role in reducing the separation between learning a foreign languge in our own country . 	1
PE	1485	A large number of foreign language courses are available online and there are various forums where people can discuss their problems on different foreign languages . 	0
PE	1486	So , it is very easy to learn a foreign in our own country . 	1
PE	1487	Also , highly qualified foreign language teachers are easily accessible in various schools and colleges . 	0
PE	1488	A child ' s daily life is school , playing and sleeping . 	0
PE	1489	To sum up , it is better for people to learn a foreign language in their own country . 	1
PE	1490	It is cost effective and there is a pool of opportunities available now to accomplish the same . 	1
PE	1491	They just worry about two things : to have fun , learn and be happy . 	0
PE	1492	Firstly , many facts about solar system can be discovered . 	1
PE	1493	Therefore , it is unwise to smoke in a restaurant as well as other public places , and relevant state laws should be codified to strictly prohibit it . 	1
PE	1494	My country need to focus more on the agriculture by establishing centers for research in this field , which will have some very positive consequences on agriculture people work , on the economy and on the employment . 	1
PE	1495	This , on the other hand , can indirectly decrease the restaurants ' popularity because fewer people are willing to consume there due to their unpleasant experiences . 	0
PE	1496	The smoke exhaled from the smoker often makes other people feel uncomfortable or disgusted , thus affecting their mood in having their meals . 	0
PE	1497	Not only does it aggravate his health , making him more subject to respiratory diseases , but also it damages his public image and reputation . 	0
PE	1498	Lastly , smoking does no good to the smoker himself . 	1
PE	1499	At this point , the public are likely to believe that the smoker lacks basic civility and should not be encouraged to be a public leader . 	0
PE	1500	This is especially true when the smoker is a popular political figure or an entertainmening celebrity , because most people see smoking in restaurants as an impolite human behavior . 	0
PE	1501	It spoils the smoker ' s reputation and threats other people ' s health . 	0
PE	1502	To conclude , smoking in a restaurant is a harmful and disrespectable behavior . 	1
PE	1503	However , the current cost of medicines is , in fact , reasonable and based on the medicines ' effectiveness . 	1
PE	1504	Apparently , the process of researching , testing and producing drugs in masses costs a substantial amount of money . 	0
PE	1505	It is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour . 	0
PE	1506	For instance , I always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home . 	0
PE	1507	Not only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads . 	0
PE	1508	Secondly , investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work . 	1
PE	1509	Those bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried . 	0
PE	1510	All of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes . 	0
PE	1511	Last but not least , spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality . 	1
PE	1512	In contrast , if the roads are enlarged , everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions . 	0
PE	1513	What ' s more , a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier . 	0
PE	1514	We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents because a part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities . 	0
PE	1515	I could adapt this method to use my real life . 	0
PE	1516	Nevertheless , supporters would argue that zoos , which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals , would provide better care for the animals inside . 	1
PE	1517	It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives . 	1
PE	1518	To begin with , it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings . 	0
PE	1519	From my perspective , animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos . 	1
PE	1520	Preserving wild animals in zoos is an issue which frequently generates a great deal of heated debate , with supporters maintaining that wild life would be taken good care from professionals , while opponents claim that the animals are deprived of freedom as a result of staying in zoos . 	0
PE	1521	Zoos should be built to protect rural animals 	0
PE	1522	As a result , the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression . 	0
PE	1523	Moreover , if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period , it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures . 	0
PE	1524	Apparently , the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss . 	0
PE	1525	Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals , it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in . 	1
PE	1526	Needless to say , such unpreventable illnesses as cancer or HIV will cost the victim a fortune , not to cure , but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years . 	0
PE	1527	Similarly , if humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health-care product , obesity , myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance . 	0
PE	1528	No one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes , especially at primary level , in the hope of raising people ' s awareness . 	1
PE	1529	Children should be taught about balanced diets , nutritious food as well as harmful ones , thereby they will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle . 	0
PE	1530	What is more , it is much easier for people at early ages to form a habit of , for instance , not consuming too much fast food , over-fried food or intoxicants . 	0
PE	1531	In addition , it will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases . 	1
PE	1532	Prevention is better than cure 	0
PE	1533	There has always been a saying in medicine : " Prevention is better than cure " . 	0
PE	1534	This statement has raised a question whether the government should allocate a large sum out of the national health budget to educating and phasing in health-protected measures . 	0
PE	1535	In my opinion , this plan should be put into practice for the two reasons mentioned accordingly . 	1
PE	1536	The computer games are like cigerate to adults and we need to set up rules to regulate this area . 	0
PE	1537	In conclusion , I believe it is better that children are not be allowed to play the computer games . 	1
PE	1538	It is not uncommon that the teenages are found sleepless for several days playing on-line games at public internet bar , and there are also some media reports regarding the sudden death case of the teenages in the internet bar . 	0
PE	1539	But we have to realize the fact : majority of the students failed in front of the computer games playing and they use their time for studying , sleeping and physical exerice to play these computer games . 	0
PE	1540	So that , I disagree with this notion . 	0
PE	1541	Thus , paying for teacher base on grade that students got is not appropriate , and it is not fair for teacher . 	1
PE	1542	In conclusion , I strongly hold my point that any descriptions of crimes should not go unchecked as any longer , as they may be false , may further drive up the already-high crime rate and may bring even more suffering to the victims of crimes . 	1
PE	1543	Without their consent , this could only add to theses innocent people ' s mental suffering and they may do some extreme actions . 	0
PE	1544	Everyone is different . 	0
PE	1545	In conclusion , a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being . 	1
PE	1546	Some students are fast learner , but some students are not . 	0
PE	1547	Although students are in the same process of education system , learning abilities in each students are not equal . 	0
PE	1548	Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule . 	1
PE	1549	In these short time , it is not possible for teachers to pay attention to individual students in class . 	0
PE	1550	Knowledge is the base of creativity . 	0
PE	1551	The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world , inspires children and encourage them to create new things . 	1
PE	1552	However , with highly advanced technology , children are able to get information from foreign countries and even communicate with foreign friends . 	0
PE	1553	Therefore , they will be able to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking . 	0
PE	1554	Second , technology widen children ' s knowledge . 	0
PE	1555	In the past , children were only able to see things from one perspective . 	0
PE	1556	In the end , he successfully invented a computer that was easy to use and lightweight . 	0
PE	1557	However , this , if occurring , should be seen as a result of the ever-increasing innovations in media technology and in our modern life as a whole . 	0
PE	1558	In conclusion , it might be unpleasant for some advocating newspapers to witness the extinction of the type of media . 	0
PE	1559	At this point , newspapers ' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive . 	1
PE	1560	This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today . 	0
PE	1561	Last , but not least , when taking environment into consideration , people must conceive that the more newspapers are published , the more trees are cut down . 	0
PE	1562	For this reason , the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply , possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time . 	1
PE	1563	The answer , perhaps , is that hardly would rational people do so . 	0
PE	1564	The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same , even usually less information than those he can have with the internet ? 	0
PE	1565	It is clear to recognize that the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries . 	0
PE	1566	All in all , the immigrants should follow the customs in the new country , which can help them survive from the culture shock sooner , and assimilate to a new culture . 	1
PE	1567	If the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia , they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated . 	0
PE	1568	Their houses and private cars were buried by local people , because the locals were jealous of Chinese people , who had so much wealth , which should have been theirs . 	0
PE	1569	Although being much richer than local people , they faced the discrimination . 	0
PE	1570	While the Indonesians stopped working at 4 : 00 pm and went home for rest , Chinese immigrants were still working . 	0
PE	1571	They formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it . 	0
PE	1572	One example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969 . 	0
PE	1573	The local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society . 	0
PE	1574	When people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one , they regard themselves as a special group in the new country . 	0
PE	1575	In order to prevent the disappearance of the historic buildings , some citizens suggest the government to spend money on historic buildings . 	0
PE	1576	On the other hand , economy is always correlate with politics , students can study specialized knowledge along with some Politian status , which may open their vision toward the nation and don ' t get limited in the textbooks . 	0
PE	1577	The city where I was born used to be of a great antique beauty , which was surrounded with by lots of ancient style buildings . 	0
PE	1578	The city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity 	0
PE	1579	Nevertheless , we also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade . 	0
PE	1580	They point out that it is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use . 	0
PE	1581	On the whole , I do believe that taxes paying for state schools are necessary to be compulsory for all members of society no matter where their children enroll in . 	1
PE	1582	As far as I am concerned , we should do our parts to do what ever it takes to protect old buildings , letting next generations still have a chance to look at them . 	1
PE	1583	For example , when somebody mentions Beijing , China ' s capital city , you will immediately have Capital Palace come to appear in your mind , because it is the most remarkable sign of the city , and also it is the inevitable history of Beijing , even the entire China . 	0
PE	1584	By seeing historic buildings - - whether related to something famous or recognizably dramatic , people are able to witness the aesthetic and cultural history of an area . 	0
PE	1585	The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system . 	0
PE	1586	They may feel more readily to learn the knowledge in this field and save much time , with that they are able to study more efficiently and more deeply than other students . 	0
PE	1587	That as well would provide the students with more confidence and let them become more compatible . 	0
PE	1588	Considering all those factors above , I suggest the basic course of economic is necessary . 	1
PE	1589	It is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society . 	0
PE	1590	When others are still struggling in preparing their resume , one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process . 	0
PE	1591	Some may argue that as time is different , the condition of job market is completely different . 	0
PE	1592	Therefore , choosing a job similar to one ' s parents ' is not always a correct decision . 	1
PE	1593	Nevertheless , since parents have worked in tens of years , they have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry . 	0
PE	1594	They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children . 	1
PE	1595	For instance , they know which company has better welfare or provides better education . 	0
PE	1596	Moreover , their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies . 	0
PE	1597	I hope people gain this skill because after that they will endorse my choice . 	0
PE	1598	Gaining more skills by study , having more than one job , and handling more tasks are the benefits of it which overweighs its disadvantages . 	1
PE	1599	To sum up , I completely approve of the statement which says people should work faster even more risky . 	1
PE	1600	Even if we ignore this result , by the same token , you can get higher position and more money . 	0
PE	1601	It turns you to a person who has skill of working without hesitation . 	0
PE	1602	Whereas , the scholars are facing a lot of difficulties apart from their high requirements of previous education , they has a lot to face the other difficulties and burden while getting admission such as accommodation , food , traveling , clothing , etc . Moreover , it is hard to get manage two things at a time for instance , working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars , they need to concentrate on their studies . 	0
PE	1603	MPhils and PhDs scholars are probably engage in the research work , which takes their full concentration and surveys . 	0
PE	1604	University is more likely to become a money making business , the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students . 	1
PE	1605	In today ’ s world education is getting expensive , and people are tending to apply for self-finance education in order to get the admission . 	0
PE	1606	I believe that universities should provide free of cost education to the interested scholars because now-a-days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability . 	1
PE	1607	I have observed that many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities because they have to think about work along with the studies , and this left them with only one choice , which is work . 	0
PE	1608	Should University education be free for everyone interested ? 	0
PE	1609	A famous proverb “ Knowledge is power ” has demonstrated the value of education . 	0
PE	1610	The idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities . 	1
PE	1611	Therefore , universities have to look over the issues face by most of the scholars ; their message should be spread education , not making money , and motivate those scholars who want to get education . 	1
PE	1612	To sum up , living with parents longer brings about memories with parents , less cost , and advice from parents . 	1
PE	1613	It is generally believed that , the second-hand smoke , which comes from the smoker ' s mouth , puts an even greater threat on surrounding people ' s health than the smoker himself . 	0
PE	1614	First of all , although it is too strong to assert that smoking should be prohibited everywhere in the society , one smoking in a restaurant is considered to enjoy his time with the ignorance of others ' health . 	0
PE	1615	This is because some burned substance in a cigarette can easily deteriorate a person ' s respiratory system after he / she inhales it . 	0
PE	1616	For example , if there is only one person smoking in a restaurant , all others will smoke unconsciously and their health is under attacked . 	0
PE	1617	Smoking brings a person great enjoyment and relief . 	0
PE	1618	Smoking should not be promitted in restaurants or other public places 	0
PE	1619	In this case , I advocate the idea that smoking should be prohibited in restaurants as well as other public places , and that we should support states laws to ban it because smoking not only damages the restaurant ' s environment , but also imposes a potential threat on others ' health . 	1
PE	1620	However , one should not be encouraged to smoke as the cost of other people ' s health . 	0
PE	1621	Additionally , there are Reality TV , television programs in which people are put into artificial environments and situations , for example like " Big Brother " . 	0
PE	1622	To sum up , it is clear that television , magazines and newspapers pay too much attention of peoples ' private lives for all the reasons mentioned above , namely to increase audience or readership and to give exciting and shocking news to a society which feed upon gutter press and Tabloid TV . 	1
PE	1623	Nonetheless , its adverse effects need controlling more reasonably . 	0
PE	1624	In conclusion , I strongly prefer studying in a group of my friends because of some important opportunities gaining with this activity . 	1
PE	1625	In conclusion , I totally believe that technology has a great contribution to our lives and civilization . 	1
PE	1626	We can not neglect profound impact of great technological process on human life . 	1
PE	1627	This is because exploiting and collecting raw materials as well as essential fuels to serve the production of technological products have destroyed nature seriously . 	0
PE	1628	Last but not least , technology may decrease a great deal of creativity in certain groups of people especially children and the youth due to the dependence upon available achievements . 	1
PE	1629	Therefore , I think this matter should be controlled by parents or somehow by directors . 	0
PE	1630	Finally , beside all above mentioned items , the study of youngsters shall always been controlled . 	0
PE	1631	On the other hand , he has to study for the exam . 	0
PE	1632	As a result , people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world . 	1
PE	1633	To begin with , in schools , main task of teacher to give knowledge to students , and this role have to finish in time . 	0
PE	1634	Travelling , social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car . 	1
PE	1635	At the same time , rather than attending any boring lecturers , students can participate to other activities such as debate competition , swimming meet , Basketball and so forth . 	1
PE	1636	From that they can meet other university students and build up the relationships with them . 	0
PE	1637	Additionally , mostly university has taken whole day for the lectures . 	0
PE	1638	Besides , most of the university students are working students in order to manage the expenses during the education time . 	0
PE	1639	Students need to work as part time basis . 	0
PE	1640	Hence , they have to schedule the lectures time , studying time and working time . 	1
PE	1641	Moreover , with the modern technology , students can collect more information from different sources . 	1
PE	1642	For example , from the Internet , students can read many articles and e-books and can watch video tutorials which provide the information more apparently . 	0
PE	1643	However , some lecturers deliver lectures very informative and interesting way . 	1
PE	1644	When the students attend that lectures , they can obviously feel that it was very useful and they did not waste their time . 	0
PE	1645	This is an important factor because you also get more space than you would in a dormitory . 	0
PE	1646	Second , from an economic point of view , people often argue that an apartment is more expensive . 	1
PE	1647	Both options have their advantages and disadvantages . 	0
PE	1648	After considering the level of freedom , the studying conditions and the economic factor , if I had to choose , I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community rather than in the university dormitories . 	1
PE	1649	Apartments vs dormitories at university 	0
PE	1650	Many students prefer to live in the university dormitories while others prefer an apartment in the city . 	0
PE	1651	You are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want . 	0
PE	1652	An apartment offers more privacy because you can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student . 	0
PE	1653	First , an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory . 	1
PE	1654	While in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules , in the apartment you set your own rules . 	0
PE	1655	To my view , I incline to believe qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee ' s competency of their jobs . 	1
PE	1656	Yet , the importance of social skills should not be neglected as those skills can help one to perform their job effectiveness and efficiency by facilitating interaction and communication with others . 	1
PE	1657	Besides , organization have been transformed to customers oriented . 	0
PE	1658	Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction . 	0
PE	1659	Interpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other , especially when conflicts arise . 	0
PE	1660	Better social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way . 	0
PE	1661	On the other hand , it is no doubt that the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers . 	1
PE	1662	It is because people nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently . 	0
PE	1663	Firstly , some people suggest that qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer . 	1
PE	1664	It is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job . 	0
PE	1665	Specifically , people who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience . 	0
PE	1666	Social skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery . 	0
PE	1667	Qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee ' s competency of their jobs 	0
PE	1668	With the increased educational level of workforce , there are growing number of employers seeking criteria other than qualifications such as social skills in their employee selection process . 	0
PE	1669	However , some employers still believe that qualifications should be the most paramount criterion . 	0
PE	1670	The essay intends to explore both sides of arguments and also present my own opinion . 	0
PE	1671	Therefore , requiring students to study in many subjects is good for them . 	1
PE	1672	People can understand more about a country , it is useful to ease tensions between nations . 	0
PE	1673	Secondly , it is crucial to keep one ’ s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin . 	0
PE	1674	For instance , children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends . 	0
PE	1675	In this new environment , parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home . 	0
PE	1676	Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated , in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism . 	0
PE	1677	Hence , it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important . 	1
PE	1678	To conclude , although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one ’ s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures . 	1
PE	1679	As far as I am concerned , sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society . 	1
PE	1680	In present educational system there are variety of competitions in academic area and athletic area for children to attend , which could stimulating the will of children to learn and to achieve the best of them , and also be able to teach them teamwork skill . 	0
PE	1681	Sense of cooperation 	0
PE	1682	A strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers , and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents , to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system . 	1
PE	1683	However , some people think it is better to make children be competitive than cooperative , both the values have its arguments . 	0
PE	1684	Being competitive leads them to success , but could also restrict them in many ways . 	0
PE	1685	Even though a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently , but it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others . 	0
PE	1686	On the other hand , cooperation is also an essential quality for children , no matter in school activities or in communities . 	1
PE	1687	For example , it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project . 	0
PE	1688	After all , in society , there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself . 	0
PE	1689	Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others , which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team . 	0
PE	1690	There are many experiences that are improve my life in many way . 	1
PE	1691	For example , I could improve the way that I solve problems , improve how I take care of my health , and improve to plan my life for future . 	0
PE	1692	For example , in math class , the way that we learnt to find an answer by doing step by step . 	0
PE	1693	Start with find cause of problem and the way to do research to solve the problem . 	0
PE	1694	What is more , it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more . 	0
PE	1695	For instance , one night , my roommate , Millan , brought his friends along . 	0
PE	1696	It is certainly true that some languages are disappearing day by day over the world . 	0
PE	1697	Several languages are in danger of extinction 	0
PE	1698	But the others do not believe it is possible . 	0
PE	1699	Some people , therefore , harbour a view saying that governments should preserve those by spending some budgets on them . 	0
PE	1700	First and foremost , it is easy to realize that languages , especially oral language , are a quite major part of culture of a country . 	0
PE	1701	In my opinion , this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly and this essay will discuss this issue . 	0
PE	1702	The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional , customs and habitants do not exist . 	0
PE	1703	It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country . 	0
PE	1704	If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these precious values , they will be destroyed in the near future . 	0
PE	1705	Thus , it is apparent that tourism has threatened the nature environments . 	1
PE	1706	To conclude , I strongly believe that the tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments . 	1
PE	1707	Another debatable problem is about techniques . 	0
PE	1708	It has been proved that overusing of the electronic devices including mobile phones could lead to higher possibility of suffering hearing loss and even cancers , although the further investigation are needed . 	0
PE	1709	This possibility exists all the time . 	0
PE	1710	There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party . 	1
PE	1711	Moreover , the mobile phone has become a dispensable multifunctional tools in people ' s daily life . 	1
PE	1712	But a more efficient and reliable system can also be invented to guarantee the private information of users . 	0
PE	1713	In conclusion , nothing can be overused without side effects . 	0
PE	1714	Not only used for communication , but it also functions as an Internet browser , a music player , a personal organizer and so forth . 	0
PE	1715	The contribution of the mobile phone to our modern society is prominent and people ' s dependence on it is irreversible , although it has a number of problems that should be well handled . 	1
PE	1716	I agree with this opinion to some extent , but when it comes to the trend , no one can predict it correctly . 	0
PE	1717	The condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash , so that there is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more . 	0
PE	1718	And I never did encounter any disappointments of missing my goals . 	0
PE	1719	In my personal experience , all my accomplishments were backed by my hard work , not my luck . 	1
PE	1720	Luck is something intangible and no one can guarantee that it would ever come your way . 	0
PE	1721	First , if you depend only on luck for all your accomplishments , you are taking a great risk . 	1
PE	1722	Instead if you strive hard to achieve what you want , then your hard work would take you at least closer to your final goal . 	0
PE	1723	If it doesn ' t work , it would be a great disappointment . 	0
PE	1724	There are many instances that luck has brought people things that they never could even imagine . 	0
PE	1725	Luck vs hard work 	0
PE	1726	Therefore I strongly agree with the argument that it is one ' s hard work that helps him reach his target . 	1
PE	1727	However , I do not see any rational in believing in luck to reach one ' s goals . 	1
PE	1728	Hence , I think it is good for us to have hobbies and do physical activities which are different from our work . 	1
PE	1729	Although it may take us a lot of times to develop our personal hobbies , but doing so can bring us a healthy body , a refreshed mind and a way to release pressure and sadness . 	1
PE	1730	Many colleges in foreign countries provide vacations to students after each semester that facilitate student to entertain themselves as well as prepare for their next semester . 	0
PE	1731	However , research done by universities proves that student ' s performance improves if they get regular breaks from their learning , preparation and examination schedule . 	0
PE	1732	So other several , prefer numbers of short breaks during the year so that student can get rejuvenate periodically . 	0
PE	1733	Many people promote one long vacation system of the school because it would help student to start their course or academic year with strong zeal of learning . 	0
PE	1734	Everybody require some break from their tight schedules likewise students also require vacation form their intense academic schedules . 	0
PE	1735	One long vacation or several long vacation 	0
PE	1736	Many educational bodies schedule its small vacations after term exams so that student ' s get relief form exam pressure . 	0
PE	1737	Firstly , several vacations throughout the year will keep stress level of students low . 	1
PE	1738	However , i discern that several small breaks will help students to be active in their academics . 	1
PE	1739	In both the scenario students relief themselves . 	0
PE	1740	However , when we consider about the question that how to win the game , we always find that we need the cooperation . 	0
PE	1741	Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective . 	1
PE	1742	Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance , it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach , and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet , and those who are in charge of the medical care . 	0
PE	1743	The greater our goal is , the more competition we need . 	0
PE	1744	Therefore without the cooperation , there would be no victory of competition . 	1
PE	1745	The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team . 	0
PE	1746	Consequently , no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one ' s success . 	1
PE	1747	A good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want , even though it is not the real needs of the society . 	1
PE	1748	And there are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it . 	0
PE	1749	However , buying habit is a very personal things for individuals , the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy , sometimes it depends on one ' s needs and ability of consumption . 	1
PE	1750	It is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income . 	0
PE	1751	Advertising impact on people ' s choice of consumption 	0
PE	1752	Nowdays , people ' s choice of consumption is heavily affected by various of advertising on television , street , magazine etc . This argument may be true that people will be swayed by the advertising and buy things they do not need it for their life . 	1
PE	1753	For example , in most asian countries , advertisement company usually hire popular singers or actors to advertise the products to boosts the sales , and some people , especially adolescent may buy things from their favourite singer advertised to support their idol instead of to fill their needs . 	0
PE	1754	In addition , products usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement , people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought . 	0
PE	1755	Most of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase . 	0
PE	1756	On the other hand , children and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not , since they do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary . 	1
PE	1757	Therefore , it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens ' tax funds to meet a minority of people ' s needs . 	0
PE	1758	For example , not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot . 	0
PE	1759	Furthermore , putting taxpayers ' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them . 	0
PE	1760	Instead , the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits , which deserves more funds from government . 	0
PE	1761	To summarize , I strongly agree that budgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities , because the former is more essential , non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens . 	1
PE	1762	That is the reason why sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support , because they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis . 	1
PE	1763	Admittedly , the study of art and music is supposed to rely on younger student ' s own interest . 	0
PE	1764	Apparently , this sense towards art is built on the initial study on the art . 	0
PE	1765	Thus , the school should replace some basic science class with some art and music class in order to cultivate student ' s interest of art without adding extra study pressure . 	1
PE	1766	The education of art and music would not work if students resist it . 	0
PE	1767	Art and music are , of course most accessible tools for modern people to liberate themselves from the extremely stressful life . 	0
PE	1768	Obviously , with the improvement of life rhythm , people have currently suffered too much pressure from their studies or jobs , and these pressure are likely to destroy one person if he cannot find a way to emancipate himself . 	0
PE	1769	At this moment , they would totally involve in the ocean of art and their stressful nervous would be relieved . 	0
PE	1770	When enjoying one piece of brilliant paintings , such as the Mona Lisa , people would put all their pressure down on the ground and just think about what the most proficient and mysterious smile in this world stands for . 	0
PE	1771	In a nutshell , in the modern society , since understanding of the lengthen and depth of the world is important and meanwhile people have burdened excessive pressure , younger students ' art and music education should not take the second place . 	1
PE	1772	It helps animals out of extinction . 	1
PE	1773	It is very crucial for learning . 	1
PE	1774	First of all , the zoo gives humans new knowledge . 	1
PE	1775	Also , it is a interesting travel location . 	1
PE	1776	Some people may believe that a zoo is futile in the era of globalization , which people can develop their knowledge fast and easily . 	0
PE	1777	Do you agree or disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose 	0
PE	1778	I believe that the zoo is invaluable for human beings . 	1
PE	1779	However , I do not agree with them . 	0
PE	1780	Inevitably , the zoo is the important place for innate learning . 	0
PE	1781	When you were so young that you did not know many kinds of animals , what should you do if there were no zoo ? 	0
PE	1782	Some people may argue that investing much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family . 	1
PE	1783	However , as a matter of fact , using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality . 	0
PE	1784	Another reason is that most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants because they want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves . 	1
PE	1785	Even they have some spare time , they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study . 	0
PE	1786	Consequently , it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality , but do not waste a lot of time . 	0
PE	1787	Besides , along with the high living standard , requirements of quality products in almost restaurants , nowadays , are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities . 	0
PE	1788	For example , my friend Lee made a mistake that he broke my precious gift . 	0
PE	1789	I want to say that mistakes will be forgotten quickly . 	0
PE	1790	First of all , a mistake does not last for a long time but a friendship lasts forever . 	0
PE	1791	In this essay , I will present two reasons supporting my opinion . 	0
PE	1792	If someone remembers mistake , he or she has a closed mind . 	0
PE	1793	Anybody does not remember mistakes . 	0
PE	1794	There is an argument regrading weather letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship . 	0
PE	1795	Friendship is more important than mistake by a friend , although mistake is terrible 	0
PE	1796	However , I believe that friendship is more important than mistake by a friend , although mistake is terrible . 	1
PE	1797	It is widely accepted by many people that a mistake will return sometimes terrible result . 	0
PE	1798	Schools in big cities may receive more funds from whether the local comities or the government , which may make them more equipped with advanced teaching facilities and attract more excellent teachers . 	0
PE	1799	Our children thus will have a better chance of pursuing high-quality education which is very important for their future development . 	0
PE	1800	If one is seeking a job right in the city or planing somewhere to travel , or just wants to buy a product in a dependable store , he might refer to what he has seen or heard from the advertisements to make a relatively wise choice . 	0
PE	1801	There is also another obvious advantage of living in a big city considering the chance of receiving better education of our offspring . 	1
PE	1802	If one can efficiently acquire the information , then , there might come along more opportunities for him to achieve his goals . 	0
PE	1803	For example , there are various advertisements here an there , whether on the leaflets or on the big screen showing things of all sorts in commercial zones . 	0
PE	1804	But a small town may be less developed to satisfy all these kinds of needs . 	0
PE	1805	Furthermore living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation , like all kinds of information . 	1
PE	1806	In conclusion , if I want to live a more convenient life with more access to modern facilities as well as with more exposure to various opportunities , and have my children receive a better education , a big city is the place to live in . 	1
PE	1807	In addition to basic knowledge like language or science , music and art are usually on the must-learn list of the parents . 	0
PE	1808	Moreover , there are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs . 	0
PE	1809	In addition , pets are important for depressed people as well because their presence make them feel better . 	0
PE	1810	I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view . 	0
PE	1811	Although I agree with the idea that knowing different fields is important . 	0
PE	1812	Things ended up that he joined in a great team , while his friend who only knew financing issues can do nothing but worked in a bank . 	0
PE	1813	Thanks to Jeff ' s hard working during his leisure time , he learned a lot about the history of art . 	0
PE	1814	But , they decided to enroll in the art system after graduated . 	0
PE	1815	They majored in financing when they were in college . 	0
PE	1816	Take my cousin Jeff and his friend as an example . 	0
PE	1817	Second , when you want to translate your major , it is important to know some of the things about different fields . 	1
PE	1818	It is much easier for us to contact than any other person in my department , which made me popular there , and much easier to get the help that I need . 	0
PE	1819	While some of the problems are the Engineering department ' s part , I went there and discussed with the colleagues there , since I have studied some of the engineering courses . 	0
PE	1820	Should we require our young children to learn music and art 	0
PE	1821	Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules . 	0
PE	1822	Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art-imagination . 	0
PE	1823	First , it ' s very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young . 	1
PE	1824	In my opinion , I agree that children should learn music and art in a young age because they do contribute several merits to them . 	1
PE	1825	With this kind of power big cities offer more opportunities for one ' s career advancements and a more chances of higher income that small towns does , and higher income can be the basis of a happier , healthier life . 	1
PE	1826	Furthermore , it ' s undeniable that the economic power of a country is driven by it ' s big cities and the majority of wealth and finance is centered and controlled in big cities . 	0
PE	1827	Finally , although I prefer to live in a big city , I can not help but assure that this is a matter of personal taste , to be clear , I would love to spend some days in countryside to recharge my soul and relieve myself from daily stress . 	1
PE	1828	In my opinion , life in the old days brings more happiness to people than today for several reasons . 	1
PE	1829	Therefore , to conclude my opinion on this statement , I want to mentioned that every experience in life whether it is good or bad always gives us something to learn and keep for life . 	1
PE	1830	I also became more casual and social with others , this experience increased my communication skill and social speaking skills . 	0
PE	1831	I had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted , but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them . 	0
PE	1832	When I moved to college hostel after school , first few days were very unsettling for me because first time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known . 	0
PE	1833	We might be facing a toughest time of life at the time , but when we think back about those moments later in life , we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves . 	0
PE	1834	Our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly . 	1
PE	1835	So , all the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through . 	0
PE	1836	It was said that Thomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb . 	0
PE	1837	Good experiences give us good memories and bad ones teach us lessons for life . 	1
PE	1838	There are many different opinions regarding world culture . 	0
PE	1839	Opinions regarding world culture 	0
PE	1840	However , in my view , a single modern culture is being created by modern technology for the following reasons . 	1
PE	1841	Some people think that all the countries in the world cannot have a single culture . 	0
PE	1842	Teachers give topics to the students who should research on the internet to find data , and then students should type their research by using computer and even give a presentation by using PowerPoint . 	0
PE	1843	Firstly , most of the countries have the same educational system based on technology . 	1
PE	1844	Secondly , new technology has created some similar jobs all around the world . 	1
PE	1845	For example , students who are studying in Iran use the same software , Microsoft , to type their homework or have presentation compared to Canadian students . 	0
PE	1846	For example , many immigrants in Canada who have the degree in computer technology fields can easily go to Canadian universities and find jobs with good salaries . 	0
PE	1847	Computer technology is a growing job in most of the countries , and students are being encouraged to study in this field . 	0
PE	1848	Compared with playing computers every day , doing part-time jobs is the best choice for students to spend their holiday . 	0
PE	1849	Actually , most students will do the part-time job in their holiday , so it will not effect on their study . 	0
PE	1850	Hence , thanks to the information her new friends has provided ; now she is more confidence about her future adult life . 	0
PE	1851	For example , Lisa thought in adult life , work is the core ; but after she knows these friends , she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work . 	0
PE	1852	However , because we do not experience it , it is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be . 	0
PE	1853	Second , parents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life . 	0
PE	1854	Actually , some questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part-time jobs , they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly ; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part-time job . 	0
PE	1855	Therefore , we need part-time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be . 	1
PE	1856	Third , some parents are afraid that the part-time job will effect student ' study . 	1
PE	1857	Therefore , the part-time job can make people understand future life better . 	1
PE	1858	When I want to go to somewhere , I try to find the way to reach to destination . 	0
PE	1859	However , parents should advise and guide their children properly so that they don ' t get misled . 	0
PE	1860	Thus , it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many . 	1
PE	1861	Looking from another perspective , written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages . 	1
PE	1862	With only pictures , everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images . 	0
PE	1863	Nonetheless , this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about . 	0
PE	1864	Furthermore , the primary way of educating students is also by this way . 	0
PE	1865	Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better . 	0
PE	1866	To conclude , both images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect , either images or words . 	1
PE	1867	Hence , for a more meaningful communication , these two elements have their respective roles to play : image to exemplify and words to describe a particular subject . 	0
PE	1868	When children are allowed to play around with computer from a very early age , they get acquainted with the previously mentioned skills and become expert before facing professional world . 	0
PE	1869	For instance , students who used to prepare Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for their school projects , get an edge over others at an early stage of their career . 	0
PE	1870	To avoid being a pessimist , we may try to conquer our distress by sharing our worry with friends or families , doing exercise regularly , and trying to see our troubles in a different way . 	0
PE	1871	Last but not least , corporational policy to to pay less to inferiors is another reason that drives labours to work on different sectors . 	0
PE	1872	For the reasons mentioned above , I believe that people are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification and also are more interested to work on various fields simultaneously to earn more and support themselves . 	1
PE	1873	Consequently , it is necessary that we should reduce and cope with our stress in the goal of balancing our mind and body . 	1
PE	1874	North American economists have published reports after scrutinizing the recent American economic situation that , technology is eliminating more jobs than creating one . 	0
PE	1875	For example , robots , automation and softwares are taking over manual human workers professions such as clerks , interpreters , security services , retails and specially in manufacturing companies . 	0
PE	1876	Thus many people ' s jobs are now at high stake . 	0
PE	1877	The best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs . 	1
PE	1878	Communication in single language would improve the productivity of the world and brings everyone on to the same page . 	1
PE	1879	Working outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household . 	1
PE	1880	Personally , I believe that married women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly . 	1
PE	1881	Why and why not ? 	0
PE	1882	Do married women usually work ? 	0
PE	1883	This is really necessary in cases of her husband ' s low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present . 	0
PE	1884	By taking up a job , a wife can earn more money to support her family life . 	0
PE	1885	Firstly , extra income that women earn will contribute to their family ' s expenses . 	0
PE	1886	I will mention some basic reasons as following . 	0
PE	1887	Secondly , working outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world , strengthen their character and show their capacity . 	0
PE	1888	So , it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money . 	1
PE	1889	Besides , in the past , conducting a research require long hours of searching in library shelves , now all can be done at a click of a button . 	0
PE	1890	You set your own schedules . 	0
PE	1891	In the other hand , living in a dormitory , and being surrounded by students also has some advantages , like being able to get help with any academic issues from them . 	0
PE	1892	This is only partially true , you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper . 	0
PE	1893	Transportation is another issue , you have to go to and return from the university everyday . 	0
PE	1894	You could choose to use public transportation , a cheaper option , or to have a car . 	0
PE	1895	The car is an expensive option , but also offers freedom of schedule and destination . 	0
PE	1896	Lastly , the studying conditions are better in an apartment because you don ' t have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories . 	1
PE	1897	A lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times . 	0
PE	1898	Since in an apartment you don ' t have a roommate , you won ' t have this problem , and as a result you would be able to concentrate better . 	0
PE	1899	For the same reason , you won ' t have a problem if you are the one who wants to play music , bring friends over , or study late at night . 	0
PE	1900	To begin with , famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people . 	1
PE	1901	Hard work make you a professional man / woman which are powerful in his or her job . 	0
PE	1902	Howbeit some people think that luck is cause of a lot of success , but to be frank I cannot agree with them . 	0
PE	1903	I would explore my primary reasons here . 	0
PE	1904	Of course don ' t . 	0
PE	1905	Also it is ridiculous if you think world wide webs such as Google , Yahoo etc . created by chance . 	0
PE	1906	And also when you see an airport ? 	0
PE	1907	Do you think they have built by chance ? 	0
PE	1908	What ' s more important : hard work or luck ? 	0
PE	1909	What do you think when you see a beautiful building ? 	0
PE	1910	Moreover , some of serious movies try to make you think about the dark sides of the world . 	0
PE	1911	" Blood diamond " , an adaptation of a real story in South Africa , focuses on the link between diamonds and conflict . 	0
PE	1912	The movie is humorous and satiric , which leads us to think what is the most valuable of our lives , and it reminds us how important our families are . 	0
PE	1913	Thus , the hidden meanings of serious movies are usually beyond words and images which make us think about ourselves . 	1
PE	1914	As a result , serious movie tell you how to see the world in a different way . 	1
PE	1915	For the above reasons , I prefer to see those serious movies which make people have deep thoughts toward their real lives . 	1
PE	1916	After watching the movie , we may learn a lesson between jewels and death . 	0
PE	1917	Diamonds are not rare or a sign of true love ; indeed , the hidden meaning of a diamond is a cruel reality . 	0
PE	1918	In conclusion , I think students understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact . 	1
PE	1919	Hence , having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently . 	1
PE	1920	However , the teaching should be in a constructive manner and students should not feel that they are being bullied for every expense . 	0
PE	1921	Last but not least , compared with teachers , parents do not have enough time to spend with their children . 	0
PE	1922	Nowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work , hence there is only limited time for them to teach their children . 	0
PE	1923	Thus , it was impossible for them to be a good teacher . 	1
PE	1924	In conclusion , teachers are the best for children ' s education . 	1
PE	1925	Is it necessary to teach children handwriting ? 	0
PE	1926	In this age of modern technology , some people usually underestimate the importance of teaching handwriting for children . 	0
PE	1927	To some people , it is considered as an arduous and time consuming task . 	0
PE	1928	From my point of view , children are those who need to be under instruction of handwriting for several reasons . 	1
PE	1929	Despite the convenience from up-to-date facilities , handwriting still plays a vital role in students ' learning . 	1
PE	1930	Firstly , this approach is a basis tool used in several fields such as taking notes , doing homework and writing . 	0
PE	1931	It enables to improve learners ' spelling capacity and accompany reading or writing disabilities as well . 	0
PE	1932	Under the guidance of parents or teachers , children can benefit from practicing handwriting . 	0
PE	1933	Some people argue that individuals of a country are responsible for many other things apart from paying tax . 	1
PE	1934	In fact , in order to develop a country , citizens must obey laws , which were imposed by the government . 	0
PE	1935	If people are paying taxes , that means they are taking part in the development of their country as well as the country ' s economy . 	0
PE	1936	Therefore , they have fulfilled their duty as a citizen . 	1
PE	1937	It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity , violence , eroticism etc . I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents ; however , in the case of adults being the audience , there ' s really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art . 	1
PE	1938	Let ' s then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals . 	0
PE	1939	If the art displays unreality , the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value ; if the art reflects the reality , then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth ? 	0
PE	1940	It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination , exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated ; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not , it is the public ' s authority to determine how to interpret its meaning . 	0
PE	1941	In a word , the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified . 	0
PE	1942	Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth ? 	0
PE	1943	Innovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life ; however , some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government . 	0
PE	1944	Creative Artists 	0
PE	1945	One of the major concerns against freeing artists ' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society ; however , I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work . 	1
PE	1946	It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it ' s rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists ' will to create . 	1
PE	1947	My personal view is that despite the emphasis of citizen safety , the government should regulate the correct amount of violent and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information . 	1
PE	1948	Citizen ' s only responsibility is to pay taxes 	0
PE	1949	There is a controversial debate around the world about the duties of citizen . 	0
PE	1950	From my perspective , a universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people . 	1
PE	1951	It is especially true if we consider the fact that a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation . 	0
PE	1952	A single international language or not ? 	0
PE	1953	The 21st century has witnessed the sweeping trends of globalization , which raises people ' s concerns about whether a single international language should be a necessity or not . 	0
PE	1954	Therefore , a single international language serves an economic purpose . 	1
PE	1955	Also , a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions . 	1
PE	1956	As businessmen from different countries have access to the same language , they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade , which can intensify the transnational cooperation . 	0
PE	1957	In contrast , without the availability of the same language , there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations , impeding collaborations between them . 	0
PE	1958	They often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives . 	0
PE	1959	Another reason should be mentioned is that adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity , while children are always keen on competition and winning . 	1
PE	1960	In conclusion , a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being . 	1
PE	1961	On the other hand , sometimes I would rather learning on my own . 	1
PE	1962	Another important point is that for practical subjects you have to have a teacher . 	1
PE	1963	Sometimes when learning a course by myself which is hard and confusing to understand and has few sources available , I get discouraged after spending a lot of time . 	0
PE	1964	A good and experienced teacher can help me learn faster and easier . 	0
PE	1965	Different people prefer different styles of learning . 	0
PE	1966	Sometimes it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own 	0
PE	1967	Learning with a teacher can prevent one from being confused and increase the rate and speed of learning . 	1
PE	1968	I think both learning by myself and learning with a teacher could be helpful . 	1
PE	1969	And then he or she will teach me the course efficiently in a short time and therefore I will learn faster and better and won ' t get discouraged and confused . 	1
PE	1970	In this situation , I ' ll look for a teacher and request for help from him or her . 	0
PE	1971	It ' s all the same in every profession . 	0
PE	1972	As we are now live in a competent world , we must show ourselves to be great enough so as to convince the employer that we deserve a better payment . 	0
PE	1973	They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily . 	1
PE	1974	First of all , a worker ' s salary can properly reflect his / her competence and value on his / her career . 	0
PE	1975	From my prospect , I believe that they do deserve this high payment . 	1
PE	1976	They are not paid for no reason . 	0
PE	1977	Therefore , those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways . 	1
PE	1978	Professional athletes and entertainers earn a huge amount of money that is hard to imagine . 	0
PE	1979	Should we pay professional athletes ( entertainers ) a high salary ? 	0
PE	1980	This salary gap between those famous people and us leads to a question-do those professional athletes and entertainers deserve this money ? 	0
PE	1981	Most of the people spending their whole life can never achieve this . 	0
PE	1982	The first reason is life is simple in the past . 	0
PE	1983	They develop broader view and can make a better choice of their future studies or courses . 	0
PE	1984	Taking a break not just has benefits but it also comes with some negative impacts . 	1
PE	1985	Nowadays , all humans compete together . 	0
PE	1986	It is not just becoming common among rich students but also in the poor students . 	0
PE	1987	Students take a break of year or two , some students travel all around the world during this time , and some choose to take up a job . 	0
PE	1988	Taking a break before starting higher education is a good idea 	0
PE	1989	Nowadays , it is an increasingly common trend to take a break before starting university studies . 	0
PE	1990	Student ' s who works tend to gather better financial resources which they can rely on during their university studies . 	0
PE	1991	Since world population getting higher , competition is getting fierce . 	0
PE	1992	Experience gained through traveling to different places , meeting different people and even at job goes long way . 	1
PE	1993	It not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent . 	0
PE	1994	To some extent , it is true . 	0
PE	1995	If you are not able to handle your jobs , then someone will replace you right away . 	0
PE	1996	That is the reason why celebrities nowadays give more good influence on young people than they were previously . 	1
PE	1997	Thus , only money and glamour look are not enough for a person to be recognized anymore , it is importance that they have to have achievements in order to be a muse to youngsters . 	1
PE	1998	People are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology 	0
PE	1999	Even , with the help of ozone machines , bacterias , mold spores , or pesticide in vegetables , fruits and foods will be killed and removed , thus health and life of eaters is assured . 	0
PE	2000	The life today is totally different from half centuries before . 	0
PE	2001	It is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically . 	0
PE	2002	Success in life should be the ultimate goal of a student , which requires more than academic knowledge , but also practical life skills such as cooking , good communication skills and teamwork spirit . 	0
PE	2003	I strongly believe that the public money should be utilized for the benefit of the society and not just for some of them who are not willing to put in more effort to find them a proper work . 	0
PE	2004	I suggest the government look into the background of the people in depth before giving out hand phones to them . 	0
PE	2005	Advances in technology do help humans to solve abundant of problems ; however it also deprives of some things that we had . 	0
PE	2006	Non academic subjects should be removed from syllabus 	0
PE	2007	According to a recent survey , 89% of people have come to think that , since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures , they have to use a lot of time to work hard , to update themselves , to acquire all kinds of skills and so on . 	0
PE	2008	While some people believe that non-academic subjects should be completely removed , I strongly disagree with that . 	1
PE	2009	To begin with , from the health point of view , schools should not only deliver academic subjects . 	0
PE	2010	If physical education is removed from the syllabus , there will be considerable negative effects on students ’ health . 	0
PE	2011	For instance , after studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning , it is better for students to do some outdoor activities , such as stretching , jogging and playing ball games , in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes . 	0
PE	2012	Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people ’ s health , it will also decrease their learning capability . 	1
PE	2013	To illustrate this further , the famous movie ' 3 Idiots ' acted by Amir Khan criticises the education system which is chiefly based on memorising and not being able to apply whatever the students learn . 	0
PE	2014	Arts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country . 	0
PE	2015	Looking from another perspective , there are certain drawbacks if artists are not restricted . 	0
PE	2016	Thus , human rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely . 	1
PE	2017	To cite an example , Malaysia is a multiracial country whereby all the citizens live together in harmony and peace . 	0
PE	2018	They might go deeper into certain aspects that can cause controversies in a country . 	0
PE	2019	Nonetheless , I believe that artists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts . 	0
PE	2020	In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races , this might end up in some chaos among the society . 	1
PE	2021	Allowing them to think freely will give them an opportunity to express themselves as ideas can naturally flow when there are no limitations . 	0
PE	2022	To conclude , it is now evident that there should not be any restrictions on artists ' work . 	1
PE	2023	Thus , they find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal . 	0
PE	2024	As you can see , if the policy of raising salary was supported , the demonstration would not happen . 	0
PE	2025	The proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries . 	0
PE	2026	In this case , students learn things easily . 	0
PE	2027	In China , some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick because these factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people . 	0
PE	2028	Even though local residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories , they cannot feel happiness from high-paying job yet because most of them suffer from cancer or other diseases . 	0
PE	2029	These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness because they feel tired and frustrated after long hour work . 	0
PE	2030	Second , beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs , which are the most fundamental requirements for people . 	1
PE	2031	Few people can feel happiness from their job because they have to continue to work more than 30 years . 	0
PE	2032	For example , Workers in the FOXCONN factory , which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company , just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day . 	0
PE	2033	Factories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil . 	0
PE	2034	In order to build city and factory , people destroy huge forests . 	0
PE	2035	Without beautiful environment , people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety . 	0
PE	2036	Nowadays , the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly . 	0
PE	2037	Besides , pupils often have a tangible competence in order that they can get the highest grade in a group . 	0
PE	2038	In a group of student , the best of those always encourages others to study harder . 	0
PE	2039	Increasing the motivation and competence spirit are another benefit of group-studying . 	1
PE	2040	In addition , such a remarkable effect has incorporation that all students can improve their weak points in a group . 	0
PE	2041	For example , when a group faces with complex math problem , they can share their opinions to solve it . 	0
PE	2042	They can work together for understanding the complicated aspect of a course . 	0
PE	2043	When pupils make a group for studying , all member of group have the same chance to help each other . 	1
PE	2044	I personally prefer studying in a group due to these noticeable features , getting help from other students , improving my attitude for learning , managing my time in an effective way . 	1
PE	2045	When I found the chance of studying in a group with my classmates , I wished I can go back in time and took all my exams again . 	0
PE	2046	Studying alone or in a group 	0
PE	2047	The reason why I think teenage students need to understand the money management basics is , primarily when secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation , students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family , during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence . 	1
PE	2048	In my view , I agree to that fact that higher school students should be made aware of the money management . 	1
PE	2049	In addition , if financial management is taught at an early age , students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status , students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized . 	0
PE	2050	For example , while I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month , I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses , during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses . 	0
PE	2051	It is hoped that more businesses and governments will follow the same initiatives for the interest of the people and the country . 	0
PE	2052	To sum up , the effort to prohibit people from smoking in public area is certainly helping in curtailing the associated health risks and to create a healthy nation . 	1
PE	2053	This example shows the benefit of restricting public smoking to a country as a whole . 	0
PE	2054	This step has curbed down the numbers of smokers in the country and as a result , Brunei remains a place known for its tranquility and cleanliness . 	0
PE	2055	In other words , that they are aware of their deteriorating health and lack of enthusiasm comes with their taste for monotony and safe ideology . 	0
PE	2056	Secondly , their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life . 	1
PE	2057	However , for a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour . 	0
PE	2058	For example , buying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background . 	0
PE	2059	So , to sum it up , both not afraid of difficulties and appreciating common but pleasant things in their lives drive me to believe that most tough experiences in people ' s life path will be a priceless treasure to them . 	1
PE	2060	Remember if you are afraid of encountering difficulties , then you will be in the troubles all the time . 	0
PE	2061	They also point out that these people have to undergo painstaking and industrious training , let alone participate in a great number of contests to be recognized and prove themselves . 	0
PE	2062	In addition , although there are many singers and athletes , few of whom could rise to fame and victory ultimately . 	0
PE	2063	First of all , some people claim that athletes and singers deserve their current salary because they have an exceptional ability that other people do not own . 	1
PE	2064	For example , hardly anyone could play basketball as skillfully as Michael Jordan - a legendary former American player who won several times in the NBA championship . 	0
PE	2065	However , that is not equal to their actual contributions to the society . 	0
PE	2066	I believe that their salary at a lower level would be more appropriate compared with other peoples in scientific or social , economic fields . 	1
PE	2067	Whether athletes and singers are overpaid ? 	0
PE	2068	Some people believe that professional athletes and entertainers are paid reasonable salaries , which can be up to millions of dollars each year . 	0
PE	2069	Overcoming all these obstacles , they should be paid a great deal of money for their extraordinary efforts . 	0
PE	2070	However , their talents should not be overrated . 	0
PE	2071	Many artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people . 	0
PE	2072	Artists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar , hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose . 	1
PE	2073	Like the media , artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely . 	1
PE	2074	However , artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people . 	0
PE	2075	Frank Zappa once said , " Mind is like a parachute , it doesn ' t work if its not open “ . 	0
PE	2076	Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains . 	0
PE	2077	In addition , creativity also gives aesthetic charm . 	0
PE	2078	As a result , they have no choice but choosing English as a second language . 	0
PE	2079	For instance , Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government , just because she raised a social issue . 	0
PE	2080	This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds . 	0
PE	2081	Commuincation can bring many benefits . 	0
PE	2082	It ' s neither to get a translated version of these articles , nor to always have a translator besides . 	0
PE	2083	By relating well to people , we are likely to have a lot of friends and therefore we will have a wide network of communication . 	0
PE	2084	Or , if you are a salesman in a store or any other place , by relating well to your customers , you will increase the chance of their coming back again and becoming your regular customers . 	0
PE	2085	For example , if you need help with getting a job , by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well and therefore they respect you as well , you can achieve your goal . 	0
PE	2086	In sum , though some people may disagree with me , as I explained my reasons and examples above , none of those factors are important and sufficient enough by themselves and we should notice to both of them because each of them has its own benefits . 	1
PE	2087	We are told at what hour we shall wake up , how we shall dress up and how we shall behave . 	0
PE	2088	Working without pressure and interaction are some examples for these disadvantages . 	0
PE	2089	Because the best conditions are sometimes not likely to be good as the expectation of people . 	0
PE	2090	Apart from that , a fair trial can be achieved . 	0
PE	2091	Then , punishment can be given in accordance to the condition . 	0
PE	2092	It is a well known fact that a jury involved in a case has no information regarding the criminal ' s past illegal acts under the British and Australian laws . 	0
PE	2093	Jury must have access to criminals ' past records 	0
PE	2094	I , for one , agree to this resolution whole-heartedly as it poses advantages to various parties as I shall discuss below . 	0
PE	2095	There are few of those who are concerned think the current practice should be altered and that the juries should at least know something about the criminals before coming to a conclusion . 	1
PE	2096	This is because , knowing their background very well will enable the juries to analyze the crime before coming up with a judgment . 	0
PE	2097	First and foremost , I believe that it would be easier for the juries to make a decision if they know about the past information about the criminal . 	1
PE	2098	The juries will be able to know weather the individual committed the crime intentionally or due to circumstances by knowing the facts about the person . 	0
PE	2099	For instance , take a person who has not murdered anyone but is suddenly found to be guilty . 	0
PE	2100	Parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their olde 	0
PE	2101	It might seem that teenaged children particularly in age of 15 - 18 are fully grown , so they do not need any help for making important decisions . 	0
PE	2102	However , in my opinion , teenagers need more attention and help in comparison with the higher ages . 	1
PE	2103	It does not seem unreasonable to suggest that governments spend more money on buses , trains , and subways investment . 	1
PE	2104	Whether governments should invest more money in traffic infrastructure or focus more on developing public transportation has erupted endless controversy . 	0
PE	2105	Nowadays transportation has attracted much social concern . 	0
PE	2106	Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways 	0
PE	2107	The fact is that the more cars and motorbikes are on roads , the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged . 	0
PE	2108	First and foremost , carbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere . 	0
PE	2109	Both these two things are important . 	0
PE	2110	Such public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society therefore they help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air . 	1
PE	2111	In the first place , there is no doubt that parents and other adult relatives are more experienced towards children , therefore they are the best advisor for their children . 	1
PE	2112	This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere , which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment . 	1
PE	2113	If governments use more money to improve roads , there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work . 	0
PE	2114	They have experienced a large numbers of stuffs during their life , so if children listen to their advices they can prevent happening worst things . 	0
PE	2115	In short , although both sides have their equally valid arguments , I am inclined to think that although Internet can be a useful tool for education , at no time will the unique role of human teachers be replaced . 	1
PE	2116	This is where the computer proves to be incompetent . 	0
PE	2117	To begin with , communication between countries and cultures become convenient . 	0
PE	2118	No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally . 	1
PE	2119	Thus , studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters . 	0
PE	2120	In my country , English is a required course from elementary school . 	0
PE	2121	In the present age , it is a matter of fact that increasing minority languages have diminished from the world due to the proliferation of English . 	0
PE	2122	Influence of English - advantages outweigh the disadvantages 	0
PE	2123	Personally , I agree with the former opinion . 	0
PE	2124	Some people claim it ' s a reasonable loss in globalization while others argue the demerits exceed the merits . 	1
PE	2125	This , in turn , enhances relationship and promotes international business . 	0
PE	2126	For them , language obstacle is no longer a problem , which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country . 	0
PE	2127	Researchers indicated that most of natural resources are un-recyclable and only several decades after , the Earth ' s natural resources are totally exhausted . 	0
PE	2128	At that time , human activity will be seriously affected due to the dependence on these resources . 	0
PE	2129	Also , people are endangering other species ' live . 	1
PE	2130	Hunting has been a fundamental activity of human for having food . 	0
PE	2131	Hence , it is evident that individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful . 	1
PE	2132	To wrap it all up , it is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person ' s life in order for one to prosper . 	1
PE	2133	However , it would be wrong to say that one ' s success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions . 	1
PE	2134	Natural talent and hard work also contribute to their progress . 	0
PE	2135	Moreover , parents are not able to function their parental care as the necessary thing to children . 	0
PE	2136	In this way , communication between family members is visibly destroyed . 	1
PE	2137	Last but not least , watching too much television people will unconsciously learn bad behavior that sow division among human . 	1
PE	2138	For example , watching film about terrorist children will be able to consider terrorism as a right thing . 	0
PE	2139	What happens if they do act exactly the terrorist in Hollywood movies does ? 	0
PE	2140	is this one of the reason cause division in society ? 	0
PE	2141	In conclusion , though television has some good sides , it has destroyed communication among friends and family . 	1
PE	2142	We need to quickly find the way to address this problem as soon as possible and the first concern is to reducing violent behaviors that children learn from television . 	0
PE	2143	Therefore , in a small town we can live in big houses with good landscapes , also because of less crowded spaces we have more facilities and more services . 	0
PE	2144	Transportation cost is less than in big cities and we have less traffic so that we can save time and money . 	0
PE	2145	Secondly , another advantage of small towns is living costs . 	1
PE	2146	Living cost is one of the important concerns in every society and then , in a small town living cost is fewer than in big cities . 	0
PE	2147	However it is an obvious fact that people in small town have more happiness and friendship and less illness and stress . 	0
PE	2148	In conclusion , I prefer to live in a small town and I think it has some advantages such as less stress , because of better weather conditions and also , better relationship within a town . 	1
PE	2149	In small town people know each other and have better deal together than big cities therefore on big cities people feel alone and depress more than small cities . 	0
PE	2150	These are two sides of the same coin which can ' t be separated . 	0
PE	2151	I firmly believe that children should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition . 	1
PE	2152	A healthy competition which involves raising one ' s own level above others is the best approach . 	0
PE	2153	Thus , competition and co-operation go hand in hand . 	0
PE	2154	' Your loss , my gain ' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run . 	0
PE	2155	Competition should be always based on self-improvement rule . 	1
PE	2156	This kind of competition gives customers more options . 	0
PE	2157	However , blind and selfish competition is detrimental . 	0
PE	2158	They must be made aware of the demerits of selfish competition . 	0
PE	2159	When co-operation and healthy competition is followed together , success , achievements , recognition and any goal becomes easier . 	0
PE	2160	By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes , we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource . 	0
PE	2161	Lastly , in school , there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice . 	1
PE	2162	The professor provides good answers to you . 	0
PE	2163	They do not mind helping you , and they never leave you alone when you got a problem . 	0
PE	2164	In contrast , in distance learning , these aspects of the professor had reduced their important . 	0
PE	2165	During student ' s free time , they have a number of activities that they can join , such as playing sports , going to lab , or going to library . 	0
PE	2166	These activities lead to more interact with their friends . 	0
PE	2167	Connection with friends improves their IQ abilities , furthermore , they have a chance to learn about their societies . 	0
PE	2168	While the online course keeps the children at their home only . 	0
PE	2169	The professor has been assigned to teach only . 	0
PE	2170	Moreover , there will be a long response from the teachers when children ask them a question . 	0
PE	2171	When I was 14 years old , my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important . 	0
PE	2172	There are dogs who lead blind people around the city and therefore without them they could not go around all alone . 	0
PE	2173	Researchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses . 	0
PE	2174	For example , nowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before . 	0
PE	2175	Computers have opened up a network connection among people . 	0
PE	2176	Computers have an important role in social and personal life . 	1
PE	2177	A large number of industries fire many forces because of doing their works by new technologies and computers . 	1
PE	2178	Despite many advantages , by coming computers many jobs has been vanished . 	0
PE	2179	By contrast , excessive use of computers has brought many difficulties . 	1
PE	2180	Moreover , People can use computers to extract their essential information easily . 	0
PE	2181	Teenagers and adolescents spend free time in front of computers . 	0
PE	2182	This technology makes easier for people to send and receive personal message . 	0
PE	2183	People who have type by computers may suffer from such disease related to knees . 	0
PE	2184	The results show that teenagers who are addicted to computer games show more violent and stressful behaviors . 	0
PE	2185	It varies from individual to individual , how they utilize that period . 	0
PE	2186	But , the break should be an optional thing . 	0
PE	2187	Importantly , the sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them . 	1
PE	2188	A break gives students more benefits than harms . 	0
PE	2189	Countries , like India , where such a break is considered a blot , should understand that young minds are delicate and they face a cut-throat competition . 	0
PE	2190	Thus , a break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies . 	1
PE	2191	One year break can help young people to prepare for the challenges of life . 	0
PE	2192	Your job has more effect on your happiness than your living environment does 	0
PE	2193	With the development of the economy , people become more and more rich . 	0
PE	2194	They start to pay attention to mental requirement like happiness . 	0
PE	2195	While I accept that job can offer happiness to some people , I believe that living environment is more important than job for most of us . 	1
PE	2196	About a year ago I was lucky to become a participant of student brainstorming game . 	0
PE	2197	These advantages are especially important in situations of shortage of time . 	0
PE	2198	In conclusion , from my point of view , type of temper and advantages of individual work are the most persuasive arguments in favor of studying alone . 	1
PE	2199	To my rivals ' surprise , being the only member of my own " team " I gained a victory . 	0
PE	2200	However , people should concern more about their living environment than job . 	1
PE	2201	First , for most of us , job is only a tool to maintain our lives . 	0
PE	2202	If good people always win , we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas . 	0
PE	2203	Then we will feel less interested in them . 	0
PE	2204	However , if the good people always get an happy ending , I don ’ t think it ’ s proper . 	1
PE	2205	First , if all the story end up in the same way , it will be boring . 	0
PE	2206	While there are also some people who do not like this . 	0
PE	2207	Personally , I prefer to see good people get rewarded . 	0
PE	2208	Both sides of the arguments have its merits . 	0
PE	2209	Modern communication technologies such as mobile phones , e-mails and internet chat programs like the MSN Messenger have brought significant changes to our lives in recent years . 	0
PE	2210	Do modern communication technologies benefit all people 	0
PE	2211	To summarize , higher fuel and petrol cost has its own pros and cons . 	1
PE	2212	America , for example , has recently drawn its intervention in Russian crisis only due to the influx of oil . 	0
PE	2213	Suppose that the those countries cut down on its oil support , other nations will have to pay more as well as release beneficial policies for them . 	0
PE	2214	Another point that should be taken into account is countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters , both politically and financially . 	1
PE	2215	However , it disadvantages may outweigh its advantages with regard to economic and politic issues , making it advisable to seek another options to reduce the use of personal cars . 	1
PE	2216	Therefore , I will conclude that technology indeed supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles . 	1
PE	2217	Only when traditional culture is integrated with the modern technology can it be developed in the long run . 	0
PE	2218	They argue that people , especially youngsters , are crazier about fresh and advanced things , such as digital products , thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques . 	0
PE	2219	But I believe this is not the issue because people tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years . 	0
PE	2220	In fact , many tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture . 	0
PE	2221	On the other hand , some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles . 	1
PE	2222	Additionally , technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage , making it more vivid and appealing . 	1
PE	2223	For example , China has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo , using a variety of state-of-the-art technological methods , such as robots and LED screens . 	0
PE	2224	In other words , those who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination . 	1
PE	2225	Secondly , if you believe that hard work is the key to success , it would make you a visionary person . 	0
PE	2226	All advantages considered , classmates are unrivalled by the children ' s parents as they provide tremendous incentive and horizon expansion , two crucial commodities leading to a successful presentation at school . 	1
PE	2227	Sharing the same age , children are at their most comfort to exchange ideas , to query and interpret abstract concepts without fear of parental punishments , resulting in deeper comprehension . 	0
PE	2228	Under the circumstances , he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work . 	0
PE	2229	To compare with the school life , they might suffer only a small punishment at school . 	0
PE	2230	For instance , if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work , the company may reduce his payment or even fire him . 	0
PE	2231	Secondly , by taking a part-time job , they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done . 	1
PE	2232	Due to the reasons given above , to encourage children taking a part-time job is a good choice for them to get prepared for adult life . 	1
PE	2233	In conclusion , to help their children to adapt adult life , parents should let them experience it as much as they can . 	1
PE	2234	Secondly , the new high school will be a place for new connections between the student of different communities and districts of the city . 	1
PE	2235	They will study with new breath and great enthusiasm in new school . 	0
PE	2236	Without their research , there will be less information of our ancestors to be known on the earth . 	0
PE	2237	Without their research , there will be more artcrafts being ruined by nothing . 	0
PE	2238	Although some of my neighbors will oppose this idea , personally I approve it . 	0
PE	2239	New high school 	0
PE	2240	The high school of my district is pretty old and lacks in necessities for students , so they can ' t get enough education . 	1
PE	2241	The new high school will bring a lot of advantages to my community . 	1
PE	2242	Firstly , I think that the new high school will bring a lots of opportunities for student concerned in education . 	1
PE	2243	I really believe that new high school is a great addition to the educational system of my community . 	1
PE	2244	Also the laboratory of physics and chemistry was in bad condition , so the students can ' t study well during the classes . 	0
PE	2245	Their old high school is pretty old and need in new educational materials , repairing of the place for sport activities . 	0
PE	2246	I belive this , due to the fact that these schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an appropriate education to their students . 	1
PE	2247	Ultimately I feel that schools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right . 	1
PE	2248	I support the points of those who say that standardized tests are required over those who don ’ t because if the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them . 	0
PE	2249	In any class there will be students who will show low academic performance , so teachers could work with them more intensively . 	0
PE	2250	Finally , I think that requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice , since in this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students . 	1
PE	2251	Thus , it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests , as long as this option helps to both sides . 	1
PE	2252	However , standardized tests offer them such chance . 	0
PE	2253	For example , after many years of teaching experience , teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries , facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills . 	0
PE	2254	By contrast , parents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way . 	0
PE	2255	However , in comparison to teachers , parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children ' s subjects such as mathematics and physics . 	0
PE	2256	Furthermore , teaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children ' s communication skills . 	1
PE	2257	In the first place , school teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education . 	1
PE	2258	For instance , to be able to obtain the teacher certificates , people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge . 	0
PE	2259	Indeed , children grow up with two important people , their parents and teachers , and both are important in children ' s development . 	0
PE	2260	As far as I am concerned , I agree with the view that the teacher is the best option for children ' s education in some aspects . 	1
PE	2261	Teacher is the best option for children ' s education in some aspects 	0
PE	2262	Recently , there has been a social concern with regard to who is the best teacher for children ' s education . 	0
PE	2263	Our youth has become very confident towards his career . 	0
PE	2264	In addition , sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe . 	0
PE	2265	On the other hand , the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology . 	1
PE	2266	First , critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom . 	1
PE	2267	This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures . 	0
PE	2268	That is because , many zoos , especially the ones in developing countries , do not provide care and attention which their animals require . 	0
PE	2269	The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment . 	0
PE	2270	Keeping animals in zoos 	0
PE	2271	Since the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized . 	0
PE	2272	Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important , whereas , others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong . 	0
PE	2273	Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn . 	0
PE	2274	To sumarize , there should never be any replacement for traditional skills or ways of life . 	1
PE	2275	They are the ones that teach , and will teach us to be self-esteem and experienced , which means their preservation throughout history deserve our attention . 	1
PE	2276	First of all , when people face with a failure they can learn a large number of things from that failure , therefore in the next effort they try to avoid doing and repeating that mistakes . 	1
PE	2277	For instance , most of inventors in the first phases of their job face with some problems and defeats , but in the next stages they learn how to deal with problems . 	0
PE	2278	Second of all , experience shows while people doing a job constantly , they become more experienced in that subject , so in the final effort they become successful with the high percentile . 	1
PE	2279	For example , scientists experiment a substance for a long time , after they gain lots of experience and knowledge about that subject they decide to make it final . 	0
PE	2280	The expression " Never , never give up " means keep trying and never stop working 	0
PE	2281	Many individuals throughout their life face with at least one failure in different areas such as education , love and economy . 	0
PE	2282	Some believe when a person faces with a failure the best way is to forget that and releases that ; however , I completely disagree with this idea . 	0
PE	2283	I always believe that a defeated person has to try and try until to achieve her or his goal . 	1
PE	2284	To sum up , I would maintain that people should not give up when they face with a failure . 	1
PE	2285	In opposite , they have to learn new points from that failure , and they become more experienced . 	1
PE	2286	Apparently , more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it . 	0
PE	2287	On the other hand , growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment . 	1
PE	2288	These days , millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure . 	0
PE	2289	It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people , particularly for the lower income group . 	1
PE	2290	Moreover , travels also help to promote the tourist industry development , boost the economy and job markets of many countries . 	0
PE	2291	They can develop their careers , broad their knowledge , and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds . 	0
PE	2292	In recent years , many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights . 	0
PE	2293	Cheap air travel should be encouraged ? 	0
PE	2294	Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged , I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem . 	1
PE	2295	People have various different views about cheap air travel . 	0
PE	2296	Overcoming problems teaches the students how to be more mature and self-independence . 	0
PE	2297	One other important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies . 	1
PE	2298	For example , students might face many challenges in the host country . 	0
PE	2299	Therefore , they should be able to deal with the obstacles that they may encounter . 	0
PE	2300	First of all , students who study outside their countries can get a lot of experience living in a foreign country . 	1
PE	2301	Living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one ' s character . 	0
PE	2302	Studying abroad is one very common thing that students do , and they have different reasons for that . 	0
PE	2303	Benefits of students doing extra jobs 	0
PE	2304	In present day and age , students are normally exposed to extra jobs as early as they start their university . 	0
PE	2305	This phenomenon , although in some extents , are proved to have negative effects , I feel strongly that the disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages . 	0
PE	2306	In this essay , some of the benefits surrounding this matter will be carefully explained . 	0
PE	2307	It is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs . 	0
PE	2308	Part-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities . 	0
PE	2309	In addition , that seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities . 	0
PE	2310	As a result , students who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands-on experience . 	0
PE	2311	Moreover , having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation . 	1
PE	2312	Secondly , students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones . 	1
PE	2313	In the conclusion , I would like to say that the more attention is withdrawn to a problem of physical education , the more influence we can get on academic success of students . 	1
PE	2314	Human activities are harming the Earth 	0
PE	2315	Alike , the school basketball team gains more knowledge on how to succeed in some particular kind of throwing the ball into hoot practicing rather than learning theoretically . 	0
PE	2316	Furthermore , almost all natural science discoveries were made by direct observation , which is a part of physical education . 	0
PE	2317	Last , but not least , financial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is . 	1
PE	2318	For instance , the money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare , since the nation is comparatively healthy . 	0
PE	2319	Along with that , physically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development . 	0
PE	2320	As a matter of fact , the better a person feels , the better his brain works . 	0
PE	2321	Therefore , putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society . 	1
PE	2322	As hence it ends up with financially competitive country . 	0
PE	2323	But they did not know that compared with hand washing dish-washing machine consume at least 2 times water and electricity to wash these tableware . 	0
PE	2324	As you can imagine , if thousands of families use dish-washing machines , how many water and how much electricity will be wasted ! 	0
PE	2325	In many countries , children are educated from their young age to be independent and responsible for their actions . 	0
PE	2326	Secondly , large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer . 	1
PE	2327	To start with , because of extensive of using machines , many people loss their job . 	0
PE	2328	Importance of ozone layer is evident by the fact as it protects us from harmful ultra violet rays . 	0
PE	2329	When they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies , doing housework and keeping shops , they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life . 	0
PE	2330	Apart from this , using of machines are also pose serious pollution and energy dissipation . 	0
PE	2331	For example , nowadays people prefer to use dish-washing machine to wash dishes and plates rather than hand washing . 	0
PE	2332	Therefore , children may see that this behavior is inexcusable . 	1
PE	2333	On the other hand , too much news coverage to famous people seems to have a negative influence on the choice of children of their future professions . 	1
PE	2334	Question about the influence of the media coverage of celebrities 	0
PE	2335	Today , celebrities appear to become a spotlight of the mass media . 	0
PE	2336	Almost half of the news coverage on television and the Internet is devoted to the celebrity gossip . 	0
PE	2337	Not surprisingly , many people are worried that this attention to the famous people has an impact on them , especially on their children . 	0
PE	2338	This essay will compare both negative and positive consequences of this effect on infants . 	0
PE	2339	Fame is a great responsibility for public people as their admirers are very sensitive to any acts of their idols . 	0
PE	2340	Celebrity scandals and gossips can quickly reach the public which perceive it very negatively . 	0
PE	2341	This means that celebrities who received attention for overuse of drugs or alcohol are likely to get public disgrace . 	0
PE	2342	This will address students ' interests because it ' s the assignment that needs real life participation . 	0
PE	2343	For example , in law class , students are informed their rights and duties and they are taught how they can apply law to different situations that might happen upon them . 	0
PE	2344	When any one of the situations occurs , they can think independently and figure out how to react . 	0
PE	2345	In conclusion , using life experiences and examples to demonstrate the knowledge on a subject is an effective way to attract students ' attention and keep them eager on learning , not only because it reinforces students ' impression on the knowledge but also invites students to practice the knowledge out on their own . 	1
PE	2346	For example , instead of driving each one ' s car , if we put forty people in a bus , it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city . 	0
PE	2347	Although , I am agree with the idea that reducing of the car use will be achieve in twenty years . 	0
PE	2348	Second , a driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world . 	0
PE	2349	So , with the risen of the aware to the environment , people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not . 	1
PE	2350	Of course , it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places . 	0
PE	2351	However , no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on , it always have some other ways that you can do , you can ride a bike , or even walk on your feet . 	0
PE	2352	I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view . 	0
PE	2353	People who hold different opinion may argue that a personal car uses is in need because a public transportation can ' t meet every place . 	1
PE	2354	It not only helps you to reduce the car use , but also good to your health . 	0
PE	2355	In this way , this won ' t be a problem at all . 	0
PE	2356	Thus , I believe that there are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers . 	1
PE	2357	Moreover , schools are also improve their quality because they have high performance teachers . 	1
PE	2358	Furthermore , students are easy to understand their subjects . 	0
PE	2359	Hence , we do not have time to spend for healthy activity such as going to a gym or doing other sports . 	0
PE	2360	This makes us a lazy person who prefers to do sedentary activities like watching television shows rather than be active and sociable . 	0
PE	2361	Second , I think watching television programs makes us lazy . 	1
PE	2362	We usually spend our times in front of television for at least three ours a day when we come back home after eight-hour working in the office . 	0
PE	2363	These genre of programs has more negative effects on our teenagers . 	0
PE	2364	They usually try to mimic what they see on movies in their daily behaviors . 	0
PE	2365	Last but not least , some television programs have a negative effect on viewers . 	1
PE	2366	Some thriller or action movies advertise negative activities such as doing criminal activity . 	0
PE	2367	To sum up , killing our time , making us lazy , and advertising negative behaviors are just only few reasons to show how television is destructive . 	1
PE	2368	I think it is a global problem to solve this problem and it is need global contribution to find a solution . 	1
PE	2369	It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me . 	0
PE	2370	Definitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me . 	0
PE	2371	I don ' t want to disavow the role of luck in success , but as you know it hardly accompany us . 	0
PE	2372	So , for example you prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question . 	0
PE	2373	If they working at multinational company as the result is they can earn higher salary . 	0
PE	2374	Naturally , children will be growing up and looking for their job . 	0
PE	2375	Since , some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard , so they will never try to solve problems on their own . 	0
PE	2376	Additionally , standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice . 	0
PE	2377	In addition , many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class , so the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them . 	0
PE	2378	Therefore , exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students . 	0
PE	2379	For example some students are not so active on the lessons , cause they are already familiar with the issue . 	0
PE	2380	Firstly , standardized tests are preferable due to the fact that they help teachers to fairly grade the students . 	1
PE	2381	However , I believe that standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge . 	1
PE	2382	This issue is important because nowadays many people cast doubt on it . 	0
PE	2383	The issue at hand is if the schools should require students to take regular standardized exams . 	0
PE	2384	Students should be required to take regular standardized tests 	0
PE	2385	This ideal , however , doesn ' t necessarily be accomplished . 	0
PE	2386	That may help you expand experiences , look for your personalities and find your new talents . 	0
PE	2387	You may love to try new things and take risks even if you aren ' t good at the things . 	0
PE	2388	In summary , even though some people claim the convenience of automobile , I would state that alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion . 	1
PE	2389	Without doubt , the more time you spend on what you do well , the more likely to achieve something great you will be . 	0
PE	2390	Focusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal . 	0
PE	2391	So , I definitely believe that you should focus on what you are good at . 	1
PE	2392	If not , you might lose another chance that you could use to accomplish other things . 	0
PE	2393	For instance , a conducted experiment indicates out-performance in skills like differentiate types of plants or animals of a child that experienced various activities in nature to a child spent most of his time watching documentaries . 	0
PE	2394	On the other hand , children who have had such activities that interrelate to creativity , cooperation , competition tend to perform significantly better in general terms . 	0
PE	2395	Secondly , watching television is a very passive action and should not be promoted by increasing periods spent on it . 	1
PE	2396	Therefore , teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens . 	1
PE	2397	Additionally , it still performs at its best to equip a child with essential skills . 	1
PE	2398	School has been applying traditional teaching procedure since for ages . 	1
PE	2399	In conclusion , despite the fact that learning by watching TV suits some children , kids should never be encourage to engage in such passive activity . 	1
PE	2400	As a result , such activities can equip a child necessary skill that is useful for his future career . 	0
PE	2401	In conclusion , even though newly developed plant foods and machinery make significant financial success for the farmers , it is convincing that the demerits of applying these new developments in the agriculture industry cannot be overlooked . 	1
PE	2402	For another , mechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry , possibly because high-end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields . 	0
PE	2403	In contrast , manual harvest prevents severe environmental damages . 	0
PE	2404	One is that it worsens the air pollution by releasing the excessive exhaust emission . 	0
PE	2405	In conclusion , I disagree with the idea that salary outweighs any other motivators , as there are other even more important aspects such as : friendly co-workers , working conditions and professional achievements . 	1
PE	2406	Biomedical engineers could make a significant effect on increasing life expectancy the world . 	0
PE	2407	Another technological innovations which help people around the world is related to medical equipments . 	1
PE	2408	In the past time doctors used pig heart ' s valve to implant , but the patient could not be alive more than 3 years after the replacement . 	0
PE	2409	For example , one of their inventions was related to artificial heart valves which can be count as a turning point in heart surgeries . 	0
PE	2410	To sum up , technology has helped us to have more comfortable life . 	1
PE	2411	But now , biomedical engineers can make artificial heart valves which works well and doctors can implant them easily . 	0
PE	2412	You can see its effects on transportation , communication , medicine and so forth . 	1
PE	2413	Zoos are big outdoor spaces in which different animal species are kept , so that people can look , learn and admire them . 	0
PE	2414	If you did , it was probably at a zoo . 	0
PE	2415	Have you ever seen a real life bear or a monkey ? 	0
PE	2416	Zoos have no useful purpose ? 	0
PE	2417	In the zoo they interact with each other and are able to relax and look at the animals , play with some of them , comment on their appearance and behavior , and laugh at their funny customs . 	0
PE	2418	When people visit the zoo , they normally do it in a group , with their families , or as a part of a school group activity . 	0
PE	2419	I strongly disagree with this affirmation because I believe zoos provide social interaction , education , and develop qualities such as animal respect and understanding . 	1
PE	2420	A lot of people think that zoos have no use , or provide no purpose . 	0
PE	2421	This could help students to learn how to deal with people , how to collaborate with people in their group . 	0
PE	2422	The zoo is a great reason for spending time with the family , it is a great activity that can be enjoyed every family member , from little children to grandparents . 	1
PE	2423	Nowadays families do not spend as much time together as they used to a couple of decades ago . 	0
PE	2424	All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life . 	0
PE	2425	In conclusion , I disagree with the opinion that children who are brought up in less well-of families are , likely , more successful in the future life due to aforementioned reasons . 	1
PE	2426	For instance , many good medicines cost vast amounts of money , which cannot be afforded by poorer families . 	0
PE	2427	Finally , wealthy families can afford better health services and costly medicines , which will be very beneficial for the health of a child . 	1
PE	2428	International aid is critical because people from other countries may be facing much more serious problems . 	1
PE	2429	My view is that international aid should be prioritised . 	1
PE	2430	They lack food , water or clothes which keep them warm , not to mention the education needs . 	0
PE	2431	Many people , for example in some African countries , are living below the basic standards . 	0
PE	2432	The world has become more prosperous than ever yet a great number of people are still living in poverty or suffering by wars or disasters . 	0
PE	2433	International aid 	0
PE	2434	However , it is controversial whether the help should go to the people who need it most or the citizens of the country where the charity organisations are located . 	0
PE	2435	Charity organisations have been playing an important role to provide support to those people . 	0
PE	2436	It is clear that those people are in desperate need of international support . 	0
PE	2437	What is worse , people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security , homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members . 	0
PE	2438	However , when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation , what we are concerned about is not the whole society , but the development of an individual ' s whole life . 	0
PE	2439	In order to survive in the competition , companies continue to improve their products and service , and as a result , the whole society prospers . 	0
PE	2440	To sum up , students can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say . 	1
PE	2441	It is out of of the questioned that the persistence of learning a knowledge in the childhood is more than other period of lives . 	0
PE	2442	By considering this and being aware of that students have not any responsibility and other difficulty in comparison with a young man , we can infer that why this time is the best time to learn any language . 	1
PE	2443	These are important foundation of modern civilization . 	0
PE	2444	Protection of tradition can provide the possibility to better understand ancient culture and utilize them to tackle modern problems . 	0
PE	2445	Meanwhile , due to the fact that traditional skills rely little on fossil energy , it is more environmentally-friendly , which should be promoted to reduce the threat of climate change . 	0
PE	2446	Furthermore those tradition-related things convey traditional culture and values . 	0
PE	2447	Although technology takes convenience to humankind , it also contributes to unhealthy behaviors of life , like sedentary lifestyle . 	0
PE	2448	Instead , traditional ways of life is a great complimentary for modern life and highlight the importance of work life balance . 	0
PE	2449	As far as I am concerned , the importance of traditions should be valued and paid attention to . 	1
PE	2450	Traditional skills and lifestyles play important role in modern society , in terms of healthcare , environmental protection and cultural inherit . 	1
PE	2451	Do you agree that the traditional skills will die out ? 	0
PE	2452	With the development of technology , whether or not it is still necessary to protect the traditional skills and lifestyles leads to a drastic controversy which is becoming a public concern , especially considering the significant impact taken by technology . 	0
PE	2453	This new university will allow a great number of people in my community to have a chance to study . 	1
PE	2454	Therefore schools should consider giving several small vocations to the students during the year . 	1
PE	2455	As it not only provide break to them from their regular commitment but also allows them to spend some time on themselves , heel stressful mind and boost desire of resuming to the regular schedule . 	0
PE	2456	For example , suppose you live in a faraway community where there is no single university and you might not want to leave your family . 	0
PE	2457	To quote an instance , in my school we used to get several vacations after our quarterly exams . 	0
PE	2458	It states that students learning capability increase after having refreshing vacation . 	1
PE	2459	Secondly , scientific research provide several authentic survey of the students ' performance after break . 	0
PE	2460	Also several holidays aid these students to not only amuse themselves but also arrange fund and materials such as books and references material for their upcoming course . 	0
PE	2461	Vacations are not only required by students but also by professionals and housekeepers . 	1
PE	2462	If you would like to attend a business school , you have to travel across the country to get to a distant university . 	0
PE	2463	I also used to spend my time on developing some recreational activity or learning some sports or game . 	0
PE	2464	During those vacations i used to analyze my performance in latest examination and used to go through those question or concept again to avoid making same mistakes . 	0
PE	2465	Whether children should start learning a foreign language as they start school or not might be a controversial issue . 	0
PE	2466	He or she definitely can get in the business school in the proposed community ' s university . 	0
PE	2467	It seems to me that students should start learning that as they start school . 	1
PE	2468	Once the animal got sick , professional vet will help them promptly . 	0
PE	2469	Thanks to the considerate care , the diversity of wild animal could be guaranteed . 	0
PE	2470	There is no denying that our environment is damaged day by day due to the fact that excessive pursuit of economic development at expense of eco-system , which pose a great threat to the survival of wild animals . 	0
PE	2471	In contrast , zoo is a good alternative choice for protecting animals as various animals could be better protected by specialized staff . 	1
PE	2472	When it comes to whether zoos should exist on contemporary society , animal-right activists strongly recommended that wildlife belong to natural environment and zoos should be banned . 	0
PE	2473	I would not go along with their viewpoint as zoos have irreplaceable benefits in terms of animal preservation and children education . 	1
PE	2474	Zoos should be banned 	0
PE	2475	Children tend to visit zoos where various kinds of wild creatures could be seen . 	0
PE	2476	Consequently , making their life more complicated and tired . 	0
PE	2477	In addition , games on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers , leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones . 	0
PE	2478	Based on the factors I have mentioned above , a conclusion can be drawn that although technology may make people ' s life complicated in some cases , the convenience it brings in people ' s are significant . 	1
PE	2479	Admittedly , to some extent , technology may make people ' s life more complicated . 	1
PE	2480	With the advent of iPads in e-learning , paper books become unnecessary , so does the blackboards , it is because all the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads , with a single click , and they would appear right before your eyes at once . 	0
PE	2481	Additionally , zoos afford a platform to education teenagers , helping to establish eco-friendly behavior towards animals . 	1
PE	2482	In the zoos , even though wild animals are caged , they have capability to walk in a limited area . 	0
PE	2483	This has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future . 	1
PE	2484	In conclusion , after analysing the effects of world games both for countries at war and for organising countries , it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society , but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness . 	1
PE	2485	As a result , it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events . 	1
PE	2486	This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team . 	0
PE	2487	South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night . 	0
PE	2488	For instance , when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa , its citizens filled up the stadiums , cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field . 	0
PE	2489	Thus , almost of us live in the environment of groups . 	1
PE	2490	After graduating from schools , employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits . 	0
PE	2491	We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life , and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life . 	0
PE	2492	Most of all , the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization , from children to adults . 	1
PE	2493	As university students , it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others . 	0
PE	2494	By making teamwork , the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others . 	0
PE	2495	During our life , it is inevitable that we may be related with any groups or organizations ; therefore , groups and organizations are an important part of their lives . 	0
PE	2496	Why are groups or organizations important to people ? 	0
PE	2497	My reasons include the following : In the first place , humans are a part of the society , and the society includes a wide variety of groups . 	0
PE	2498	In my point of view , groups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals . 	1
PE	2499	Thus , I strongly support the current laws of Great Britain and Australia , and would not change the regulations on keeping the jury unaware of past actions . 	1
PE	2500	More wastes have to be managed . 	0
PE	2501	Maybe crime rate will also increase . 	0
PE	2502	International sporting occasions help to ease international tensions 	0
PE	2503	Traffic may worsen . 	0
PE	2504	However , building the university may lead to some social problems . 	1
PE	2505	For example in FIFA World Cup 2010 , the relation between North Korea and South Korea is dangerous for the warship sinking . 	0
PE	2506	An international sporting event is normal held in a country with huge interest from fans all over the world . 	0
PE	2507	This can also help stimulate the local economy . 	1
PE	2508	The world suspected North Korea of the aggressive action . 	0
PE	2509	However , due to this event North Korea showed a friendship and enthuasism . 	0
PE	2510	These social problems may impair the quality of life in the community . 	0
PE	2511	In sum , I myself agree with the plan to build the university . 	1
PE	2512	As a result , if we don ' t have a good stress management skill , it may lead to some critical problems . 	1
PE	2513	When society had problems , it could impact to a nation . 	0
PE	2514	Thus , government should create campaign to fill love to family . 	1
PE	2515	Lastly , family is a root of society . 	0
PE	2516	If everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other , that family could have problems , If family had problems , it mean society could have problems . 	0
PE	2517	In conclusion , I personally agree with statement that government should spend money on basic people needs . 	1
PE	2518	The basic needs : jobs , good environment , and love in family . 	0
PE	2519	For example , setting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other . 	0
PE	2520	When family understand each other , it mean society and a nation will not have much trouble . 	0
PE	2521	These three issues are the most important basic needs of people in my opinion that government should pay attention on to improve quality life of people . 	1
PE	2522	To boost their sales and win over customers , companies pour a great amount of money into advertising . 	0
PE	2523	Famous people are bothered by the media 	0
PE	2524	Some people think that mass media should only focus on news and current affairs . 	0
PE	2525	Instead , the government and medical foundations should be responsible for the distribution of drugs to the undeveloped world at a more reasonable price . 	0
PE	2526	This issue is a controversial one , but in my opinion a closer examination reveals that mass media deal too much with superficial things for different reasons . 	1
PE	2527	One reason is that television and newspapers focus on famous peoples ' lives in order to increase their audience or readership . 	1
PE	2528	Gutter press and Tabloid TV are more and more replacing quality papers or documentaries programs . 	0
PE	2529	Thanks to the Internet , we can go online and have access to information from all over the world and therefore mass media don ' t need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience . 	0
PE	2530	Another reason is that we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip . 	1
PE	2531	Therefore , the measure cannot be adopted , otherwise those companies will go into liquidation . 	1
PE	2532	In short , this is not a long-term solution . 	0
PE	2533	Moreover , these products prove to ensure human health completely . 	0
PE	2534	Suppose companies were forced to reduce the cost of drugs , they would make no profit , even running up debt because of production expenditure . 	0
PE	2535	Additionally , charitable organizations can buy medicines from developed countries and distribute to the undeveloped world for free . 	0
PE	2536	In conclusion , I disagree with reducing the cost of medicines , which may exacerbate their qualities . 	1
PE	2537	Fortunately , there are other measures to improve the situation . 	1
PE	2538	It is advisable for the government to encourage medical production by supplying land for building factories and reducing part of the taxes . 	0
PE	2539	Most of the time , it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product . 	1
PE	2540	Clearly , although pets aren ' t able to speak with us , we can nonetheless count on them . 	0
PE	2541	Therefore , a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one . 	1
PE	2542	Secondly , police force carries guns only in high crime societies . 	0
PE	2543	Few individuals assume that this trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society . 	1
PE	2544	I totally agree with this viewpoint for some specific reasons which would be given and analyzed in the following paragraphs . 	0
PE	2545	Police force carries guns - significant impact for level of violence 	0
PE	2546	The increasing number of street criminals leading to carrying guns in police force has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today ' s society are very concerned for . 	0
PE	2547	Thus , citizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally . 	0
PE	2548	Moreover , while on duty , not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars , houses , streets are likely to be destroyed by guns . 	0
PE	2549	First of all , we need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself . 	0
PE	2550	As a result , criminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs . 	0
PE	2551	By which I mean , huge cooperation hire celebrities as the face of their product . 	0
PE	2552	Since I was all alone at home for a long time , my dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings . 	0
PE	2553	Some people think that , adults need playing games as children do . 	0
PE	2554	However , in my opinion , games are no longer too important for them for several reasons . 	1
PE	2555	Talking to my friends was frustrating because none of them have ever felt that way . 	0
PE	2556	Parents and even children do not want to communicate with each other instead of watching TV in their own room . 	0
PE	2557	As a consequence , children will learn behavior from what they see on TV not from their parents . 	1
PE	2558	However , have you ever thought that television has destroyed communication among friends and family ? 	0
PE	2559	I personally consider this fact as the harmful thing that television has brought upon us . 	1
PE	2560	Television versus Friends and family 	0
PE	2561	We all know that television provides us many benefits ; it helps people relax , helps keep up with news , helps broad our mind . 	0
PE	2562	Gradually , their friends leave them behind either activities or studying . 	0
PE	2563	Secondly , with the rapid change of the standard of life , each family has three or four TV in each room is more common . 	0
PE	2564	First of all , since people watch television too much , they can be isolated from others . 	1
PE	2565	Children , for example , pay more attention on movies , music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others . 	0
PE	2566	Perhaps , no issue in this world is as significant to people as cooking food , because it affects everybody in their daily lives . 	0
PE	2567	Some people hold the opinion that people should spend much time on food . 	0
PE	2568	Thus , it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future . 	1
PE	2569	And this figure still continuously go up along with the improvement of science and technology . 	0
PE	2570	For example in relationships . 	0
PE	2571	Firstly , people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time , which leads to numerous advantages . 	0
PE	2572	From my personal experience I recall that my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city . 	0
PE	2573	It is said that , surprisingly , he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup because , at least for him , using two different soups properly was quite annoying . 	0
PE	2574	As a result , I could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university-level problems . 	0
PE	2575	Because I was really satisfied with the fact that I could do preferably , I became to absorb myself to try more advanced level of math problems . 	0
PE	2576	That is problem in quality of education . 	0
PE	2577	Lastly , there could lead to a big problem if schools pay teachers by grade that students get . 	0
PE	2578	Then , you will motivate yourself to do more . 	0
PE	2579	To begin with , I agree that sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems . 	1
PE	2580	The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology . 	0
PE	2581	In earlier times , for instance , even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence and as a result they had more outdoor activities . 	0
PE	2582	Nowadays people , especially inhabitants of cities , are spending most of their time on sitting in front of TV or other tools . 	0
PE	2583	Recent medical problems and sedentary lifestyle . 	0
PE	2584	It is certainly true that modern people are facing up to a new health problems and ailments than before . 	1
PE	2585	Many people claim that it is because of sedentary lifestlyle . 	1
PE	2586	However , while I accept that sedentary lifestyle is one of the key factors , I believe that some other factors are having even a greater impact . 	0
PE	2587	Nevertheless , there are some other causes why people are experiencing serious medical problems . 	1
PE	2588	Firstly , the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses . 	0
PE	2589	Just imagine : if a student can ' t even make out whether the source is reasonable or not , then how can he get the right information to help him to learn ? 	0
PE	2590	Because not only do teachers teach us knowledge but also the skills to tell right from wrong . 	1
PE	2591	Students have knowledge of others cultures , outer space etc . Personally , I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source . 	1
PE	2592	For instance , Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes . 	0
PE	2593	Moreover , they contend that good television programs do teach students . 	0
PE	2594	They can only input some key words and google it , and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it . 	0
PE	2595	Those who feel that students learn far more from other sources , such as the Internet and television , firmly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can ' t learn in classes . 	1
PE	2596	In conclusion , fatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child ' s life starting from the the birth due to providing appropriate parenthood and having healthy family relationships . 	1
PE	2597	Therefore , I believe that having and raising children should not be different than any other daily activity . 	0
PE	2598	In conclusion , there is to say that , given the arguments above , living a slower life is advantageous for your health , your happiness and even the quality of your work . 	1
PE	2599	Should the cost of medicines be reduced ? 	0
PE	2600	At present , a large number of patients in poor countries are suffering from deaths caused by lack of medication rather than dangerous diseases . 	0
PE	2601	It is suggested that companies in developed countries ought to reduce their price of medicines to avoid such unnecessary deaths . 	0
PE	2602	Admittedly , more lives will be saved by the use of effective medicines . 	0
PE	2603	The medical industry in developing countries is incapable of producing high-quality drugs . 	0
PE	2604	With advanced technology , the developed world has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in making medicines , which can cure a variety of serious illnesses . 	0
PE	2605	If people in poorer countries gain access to these drugs , their health situations may be better . 	0
PE	2606	The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity . 	1
PE	2607	The centre of research for agriculture can make some research in how to get a good quality of this product , how to treat the Palme and maybe how to treat the land of the palms . 	0
PE	2608	For example , the dates are the most important agriculture product in my country . 	0
PE	2609	The centre of research can raise the market part of this field by developing the agriculture products . 	0
PE	2610	The agriculture field has only thirty percent as a market part . 	0
PE	2611	For me being a developed country does not mean that we have to focus only in business , but we have to focus on what really bring us to the level of self satisfaction , and the agriculture for our country is the field that can realize that . 	0
PE	2612	Some people think that a centre of business research is more important because we have to be in parallel with the advanced countries which have focused in business field . 	1
PE	2613	Obviously , showing people how to exploit a land and get good agriculture products will push people to think about working in the field of agriculture rather than working in business or other field to make money . 	0
PE	2614	Another reason that makes the centre of research for the agriculture more important than the centre of business research is that the first one can create a lot of jobs . 	1
PE	2615	Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground , which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles . 	0
PE	2616	However , in my view , reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies for the following reasons . 	1
PE	2617	So , the government have to invest more for it and encourage people to use . 	0
PE	2618	When we drive a private car , we are alone or only our family members that we already know and lost the opportunity to make friends with others or to see that we are a part of this society . 	0
PE	2619	The use of public transportation make us live more sociable . 	1
PE	2620	Using public transportation has a lot of advantages for the modern society facing a lot of problems : the environmental population , the isolation in life , the depletion of natural resources . 	1
PE	2621	When using public transportation , we have a chance to meet more people and more chances to discovery new aspects of life . 	0
PE	2622	The more cars are driven , the more pollution will be put into air . 	0
PE	2623	They cause pollution and make the Earth warmer . 	0
PE	2624	The atmosphere , surrounding us , will be protected and help us more healthy . 	0
PE	2625	If we use the public transportation , less cars will be used and less pollution will be emitted . 	0
PE	2626	Furthermore , even though some customers do not worry about the threat that second-hand smoke imposes on them , the disgusting smoke will severely affect their appetite , or , in other words , spoil their meals and make them an unpleasant experience . 	1
PE	2627	Therefore , smoking in restaurants should be strictly banned because it makes the restaurant a polluted place which threatens every customer ' s health . 	1
PE	2628	On the other hand , some people maintain that the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system because more pension have to spend for Medicare instead of investing in other sectors of the economic system . 	1
PE	2629	It can be said that the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people . 	1
PE	2630	In facts , young people will be happy as their parents , grandparents are healthy . 	0
PE	2631	In addition , a community with the elderly who have a good health has a major role to play in a sustainable development of a society . 	0
PE	2632	In other words , they do not have to spend more time in health checking or treatment so this saves an amount of time as well as cost . 	0
PE	2633	They can contribute effectively to the development of the economy because healthy workers can create more productivity . 	0
PE	2634	The main advantage of high-tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health . 	1
PE	2635	Although the increase in life expectancy has some pressure on the Medicare system , I am inclined to believe that the advanced medical care brings with it more benefits than disadvantages . 	1
PE	2636	Along with the development of technologies , advanced medical care has played an important role in the improvement of life expectancy . 	0
PE	2637	Improved medical care 	0
PE	2638	Now , it is time to start without any regret from my previous exams . 	0
PE	2639	I can receive some helps from other student as well as improving my learning skills , also managing of time is another achievements of group-studying . 	1
PE	2640	Secondly , reading a novel is more convenient . 	1
PE	2641	Therefore , time management is another brilliant benefit of group-studying . 	1
PE	2642	Group-studying causes some kind of internal obligation to manage the time , inasmuch as we always care about other people and we do not want to waste their time . 	0
PE	2643	When the students study with their friends , they should have schedule to use their time in an effective manner . 	0
PE	2644	Clearly , better learning is one of noticeable result of these competences and encouragements . 	0
PE	2645	Admittedly , technology may have negative effects on children . 	1
PE	2646	Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend . 	0
PE	2647	Professors not only have the knowledge , but also equip with experiences , knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements . 	0
PE	2648	Classes are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students . 	0
PE	2649	First , in terms of learning , attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams . 	1
PE	2650	In my opinion , I believe that students should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is . 	1
PE	2651	These different ideas of learning methods lead to a question whether it is necessary for university students to attend the class as long as they can pass their examinations . 	0
PE	2652	Some students still rely on classes to keep up with the courses , while some students don ' t feel the need to attend classes because they believe that they can handle the exams . 	0
PE	2653	In university education , students are given much independence in the ways of learning . 	0
PE	2654	University students should attend classes or not ? 	0
PE	2655	Attending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves . 	0
PE	2656	Second , it ' s students ' basic responsibility to attend class . 	0
PE	2657	Spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one ' s life 	0
PE	2658	Despite friendship is one of the most important values in a man ' s life , people might have different preferences : some of them prefer to spend time with one or two close friends , while other prefer to be surrounded by a large number of friends . 	1
PE	2659	In my view , I prefer the second attitude . 	0
PE	2660	The first reason is that staying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others ' experiences . 	1
PE	2661	For instance , among a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport , or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before . 	0
PE	2662	Of course , while differences give the opportunity to learn , they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement . 	1
PE	2663	This would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends . 	0
PE	2664	In fact , in this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same . 	0
PE	2665	Another reason is that a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded . 	1
PE	2666	For example , if you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice , your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages . 	0
PE	2667	In my opinion , though competitive children will be far more clever and faster than the co-operative child in an initial level , but it will not help them to be on the success path for the long run ; while on the contrary , co-operative child will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team . 	1
PE	2668	I agree that nowadays the learning process benefits greatly from computers , but they are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human ' s touch . 	0
PE	2669	Secondly , children need human interactions . 	1
PE	2670	However , I do not agree that this explosion in technology will ' innovate ' the education system , by replacing teachers with computers . 	1
PE	2671	There are several reasons why teachers will never be replaced by computers . 	0
PE	2672	There will be soon no role for teachers in classrooms 	0
PE	2673	In recent years it has become more common for teachers to use technological tools in the learning process . 	0
PE	2674	For example , lessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector . 	0
PE	2675	However , scientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching . 	0
PE	2676	Firstly , computers need to be operated by people . 	1
PE	2677	No one can argue that technological tools are must-haves for the classroom of today . 	0
PE	2678	In my view , both can help and each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages . 	1
PE	2679	Scientists try and test many specimens before they get they want . 	0
PE	2680	No known scientist has success in first attempt . 	0
PE	2681	All inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations . 	1
PE	2682	But they slowly tune their technique and learned to walk . 	0
PE	2683	For example , when they tried to learn walking , they stumble and hurt themselves many times . 	0
PE	2684	Every day comes with new challenges for them like walking , eating , etc . , but those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life . 	1
PE	2685	The best example of it is how babies learn about basics survival habits during their childhood . 	0
PE	2686	My opinion based on the reasons that Every tough experience makes us more skilled , improves our decision making and makes us more compatible for life . 	1
PE	2687	I agree with the statement that our life seems tough at the time but those difficult experiences of life become important lessons for the future . 	0
PE	2688	Every experience always gives us something to learn and keep for life 	0
PE	2689	We have no choice but have to live in a fast pace . 	0
PE	2690	In conclusion , while there some people live in a pretty good condition , it is only a minority . 	1
PE	2691	Today , we are able to read the news all over the world , to chat with people through the Internet , or to travel around the world by planes ; however , it also means that any thing happens in the world will affect our life . 	0
PE	2692	If we cannot react properly and immediately , then we will be in a vulnerable situation . 	0
PE	2693	Thus , the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today . 	1
PE	2694	The third reason is that the pace of life . 	1
PE	2695	Everyday , I walk on hard roads , breath in polluted air , and live in a limited space . 	0
PE	2696	What ' s worse , it has been proved that living in this kind of condition will result in some mental diseases . 	0
PE	2697	Second , the environment today is serious damaged . 	0
PE	2698	Looking out the windows , what I see isn ' t sky , trees or mountains , but is coldly high buildings . 	0
PE	2699	Some people who send their children to private schools contend that the amount of taxes they pay for the state education is unreasonable . 	0
PE	2700	The tax reduction of state school for parents who have children studying in private system 	0
PE	2701	Firstly , by paying taxes for public school , affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor . 	1
PE	2702	However , I am utterly convinced that these taxes are absolutely essential . 	1
PE	2703	With the the tax amount for which they pay , the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies , and earn a better quality of life . 	0
PE	2704	It is true that many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course . 	0
PE	2705	Obviously , this reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation ; therefore , the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue . 	0
PE	2706	Secondly , the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital . 	1
PE	2707	Many parents supporting for the idea of tax discounts claim that such tax payments are unfair for them . 	1
PE	2708	In addition , the government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials , and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care . 	0
PE	2709	If people are equipped with a single international language , they can tell each other smoothly about their countries ' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles , which enables people to expand their outlooks , viewing the world in new angles . 	0
PE	2710	For example , when people travel to foreign countries , the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language , helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience . 	0
PE	2711	Learning English can foster people ' s sentiment and nourish their literature and art . 	0
PE	2712	In addition , English is a beautiful language , which is more systematical and extensive than many other languages . 	0
PE	2713	With the development of globalization , English became the dominated language in national trade , conference and many important events . 	0
PE	2714	Advantages and disadvantages of the prevalent of English 	0
PE	2715	Some people claim that the prevalent of English brings a great number of benefits for people . 	1
PE	2716	This phenomenon has aroused a heated discussion in public . 	0
PE	2717	In the ancient time , the different languages and geography set barriers for people to exchange their goods and ideas . 	0
PE	2718	First of all , it promotes the communication and interaction between different countries more conveniently and clearly . 	0
PE	2719	If we can popularize the use of English , the language hinder will disappear as well . 	0
PE	2720	Fortunately , the innovation of plane and train solved the geographical barriers . 	0
PE	2721	In other words , if you can ' t take any criticism , not only will you fail in cooperating with other people , but also get defeated in personal works . 	0
PE	2722	As one Chinese idiom goes : " The good medicine tastes bitter “ . 	0
PE	2723	However , criticism can help you detect those drawbacks and fix them if you are willing to take it . 	0
PE	2724	Those who don ' t even take a word of criticism will eventually lose chances to get improved . 	0
PE	2725	Even if you are not working in a group , you still need to take others ' criticism . 	1
PE	2726	Criticism definitely hurts because it points out your drawbacks and forces you to confront them . 	0
PE	2727	It ' s every member ' s duty to respect other ' s opinion . 	0
PE	2728	Second , taking criticism is a virtue as you take someone ' s opinion that is against you . 	0
PE	2729	Criticism might be the most powerful solution to heal . 	0
PE	2730	However , some people might ask : what if the criticism proves to be wrong ? 	0
PE	2731	Secondly , professional lives are filled with tasks that is neccessary parts of the jobs . 	1
PE	2732	Nobody likes attending boring conferences , or working a person who isn ' t well in with anyone . 	0
PE	2733	I ' m a research asistant at a university , and as any of the univesity in ours we have a professor who isn ' t good at human relationships , most of the asistans don ' t enjoy to talk with him about any situation , although we have to ask about his field . 	0
PE	2734	Thirdly , doing something which an individual doesn ' t enjoy can led to enjoyment . 	1
PE	2735	People sometimes can attend any activities by insisting on any of their friends although they don ' t really want . 	0
PE	2736	For example , one of our friends tell my husband and me about a dance course which we both don ' t like . 	0
PE	2737	After insisting on some of our friends , we attended , and got really enjoyable time , we continued the course about six months although most of our friends left the course after a month . 	0
PE	2738	Nobody has a life with a lot of fun ; there are sometimes unpleasant and boring parts which is not liked by anyone , but most of them are about responsibilities which is the part of individual ' s live . 	1
PE	2739	Besides , dancing could show how civilization of that culture is . 	0
PE	2740	Moreover , people use dancing to entertain themselves . 	0
PE	2741	So dancing is important in every culture . 	1
PE	2742	This may confuse children who should not choose their future job because of the influence of the mass media , but from the basis of their own interests . 	0
PE	2743	In conclusion , parents should be more worried about their children ' s attitudes to the ' cult of celebrity ' . 	1
PE	2744	As recent surveys showed , inspired by the fame and wealth , children now prefer more to become an actor / actress or a sports star than it was in the past . 	0
PE	2745	Many schools for preparation of so-called stars and various advertisements about famous people may mislead with the fact that this profession is highly required and easy reachable . 	0
PE	2746	They should teach their children how to distinguish shortcoming stars from truly talented ones and to put right priorities in life . 	0
PE	2747	Mobile phones , such as smart phones , has made our communication easy and convenience . 	0
PE	2748	However , we may perceive this issue from different viewpoints . 	0
PE	2749	Thus , mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication . 	1
PE	2750	The reason is that , as most of the telecommunication companies provide us with access to the internet via our phones , people are able to enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls free of charge . 	0
PE	2751	Therefore , i highly advocate that we should use mobile phone in moderation in order to avoid these serious problems . 	0
PE	2752	To sum up , although mobile phones make our communication faster , it also gives rise to many social problems such as children ' s social skills and their mental health . 	1
PE	2753	Therefore , even when we grow older , get married and then have our own families with spouses and children , parents always keep watching us and help us to realize which is right and which is wrong in life . 	1
PE	2754	On the other hand , it is possible for ordinary people to participate in some actions of environment protection , and they also can benefit from the improvement of environment . 	1
PE	2755	For instance , many people driving private cars could cause air pollution , and overusing plastic packages would affect the environment . 	0
PE	2756	If people can gradually change some lifestyles in these daily activities , this will have many significant impacts on environmental improvement . 	0
PE	2757	In conclusion , the government and corporations should take more responsibility for addressing environmental issues , but every citizen also can contribute to the environment . 	1
PE	2758	Therefore , with the advent of internet and online paying systems , you can do many thing at your home easily . 	1
PE	2759	Not only with the help of sending email , but also using credit cards to pay all necessary fees online . 	0
PE	2760	But nowadays , all people can take advantage of internet to have their own email free , and send their emails to everyone in no time , besides they can be sure if their emails have been delivered or not . 	0
PE	2761	Many years ago , peoples had to pay a great deal of money to post their letters , and their payements were related to the weight of their letters or boxes , and many accidents may cause problem that the post could not be delivered . 	0
PE	2762	Today , students can apply for foreign universities much easier than before . 	0
PE	2763	Another important aspect on technology is transferring money . 	0
PE	2764	Nowadays , everyone can see the effect of technology on their life , especially on the way of transportations and communications such as the airplane and the telephone . 	0
PE	2765	Advance in transportation and communication like the airplane and the phone 	0
PE	2766	First and foremost , email can be count as one of the most beneficial results of modern technology . 	1
PE	2767	There are lots of other effects of growing technology on transportations and communications , which are mentioned as follows . 	0
PE	2768	However , some people think it ' s not a good educational measure . 	0
PE	2769	Their parents allow them to take some jobs because these jobs can help them learn and take responsibilities . 	0
PE	2770	In conclusion , although we cannot deny machines are play a vital role in people living and working , problems posed by machines should draws more attentions as well . 	1
PE	2771	Children engagement in paid work 	0
PE	2772	Therefore , they are likely to understand their parents ' hardship , to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving . 	1
PE	2773	Especially in large population countries , high unemployment rate may cause crime and social instability . 	0
PE	2774	First of all , children can learn about the hardship of earning money . 	0
PE	2775	From my point of view , the benefits of children engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks . 	1
PE	2776	To keep their jobs , children will have to try their best to finish their duties . 	0
PE	2777	Secondly , when children take jobs , they tend to be more responsible because whether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working . 	1
PE	2778	Higher education should be available only to good students or not 	0
PE	2779	No one can disagree that knowledge is the most important for everyone . 	0
PE	2780	College and university are playing in an important role to provide academic skills to people in order to pursue their goal . 	0
PE	2781	There are an issue that some people agree that this opportunity should be preserved for good students however there are others people who think that everyone should have this chance to gain these advance skills from college or university . 	0
PE	2782	This issue will be discussed . 	0
PE	2783	First of all , many people think that college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students . 	1
PE	2784	The reason is that studying in advance education take a huge of money . 	0
PE	2785	College and university do not want people who not qualify for to waste their money in these expensive courses and waste their time . 	0
PE	2786	They believe that only good students have potentials to success programs more that those who are not considered as good students . 	0
PE	2787	Consequently , mediocre students are not have a chance to gain these advance knowledge from college and university . 	0
PE	2788	On the other hand , studying hard will give children a better future . 	1
PE	2789	Studying hard gives children with a plenty of knowledge and skills for their future . 	0
PE	2790	Some people believe that studying hard is essential part for children , otherwise others people think that playing sport is waste of time . 	0
PE	2791	In my point of view , both of studying hard and playing sports are part of life to children . 	1
PE	2792	Children should studying hard or playing sport ? 	0
PE	2793	Both can improve their future 	0
PE	2794	Secondly , at school we study bigger things about sciences and languages , but after school we learn from our parents . 	0
PE	2795	In my opinion , we spend most of our time at home with our families than it at school . 	0
PE	2796	As we were born , parents taught us from the very little things such as how to smile , how to walk to the ordinary routines such as eating . 	0
PE	2797	Moreover , when we grow bigger , they teach us many fairy tales and several important ethic lessons that affect us till the end of our lives . 	0
PE	2798	I whole-heartedly agree with this opinion because of these following reasons . 	0
PE	2799	Firstly , parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life . 	1
PE	2800	Getting the best lessons , besides our abilities to self-study , depends on our teachers a lot . 	0
PE	2801	There are people who believe that no one else is better than our parents in terms of teachers . 	1
PE	2802	Parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life 	0
PE	2803	Learning is a thing that we do in all of our lives . 	0
PE	2804	Moreover , the increasing taking advantage of advanced equipment could make students be lazier and more subjective in their writing skills . 	0
PE	2805	For example , with the assistance of automatic grammar and spelling checking in office word , learners are now no need for noticing much in their mistakes . 	0
PE	2806	The fact is that kids who are bad at handwriting meet difficulties in taking notes and catching up lessons . 	0
PE	2807	It resulted in the missing of information and the lack of details during their works . 	0
PE	2808	To conclude , no matter how fast and convenient modern devices bring to us in writing , handwriting is still a needed skill for all of people , especially students at the early age . 	1
PE	2809	Thus , the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation . 	0
PE	2810	When you ' re doing something well , you will feel more satisfied and more interested in it . 	0
PE	2811	If you keep doing what you already do well , you can be better good at it . 	0
PE	2812	As the example above indicates , you will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well . 	1
PE	2813	Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances because they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle . 	1
PE	2814	Nowadays the automobile is one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday life . 	0
PE	2815	People are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time 	0
PE	2816	Generally speaking , I definitely agree with the statement that cars have improved modern life , for several reasons . 	1
PE	2817	Many people own cars and use them daily , which clearly shows how important they are . 	0
PE	2818	In summary , doing what you can already do well helps you make a big accomplishment and do it much better . 	1
PE	2819	Thus , by doing what you are good at , you will be better at it . 	1
PE	2820	Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today . 	0
PE	2821	I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away . 	0
PE	2822	Telephones and email make me feel personal because I could directly connect with people that I love . 	1
PE	2823	Thus , these types of communications make me feel personal . 	0
PE	2824	As a result , I believe that telephones and email do not make communication between people less personal . 	1
PE	2825	Beside , I could express my personal thought through telephones and email . 	0
PE	2826	Second , using telephones and email could express some important words better than face-to-face communication . 	1
PE	2827	Telephones and email made me feel close to my parents . 	0
PE	2828	So , when I have a time to realize what had happened , I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion . 	0
PE	2829	For instant , sometime when I argue with my friends , I cannot express my self to my friends at that moment . 	0
PE	2830	Some people believe that strictly and carefully presenting theories in the class is the best way of teaching , while others assert that involving applications on that theory will be more convincing . 	0
PE	2831	In my opinion , I agree with the second idea that the best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school . 	1
PE	2832	How teachers can make the subject interesting to students ! 	0
PE	2833	Some people would rather watch TV . 	0
PE	2834	Together , they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays . 	0
PE	2835	Reading fictions is more pleasant 	0
PE	2836	There are many different opinions regarding hobbies . 	0
PE	2837	Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels , where each scene is happening . 	0
PE	2838	For example , after I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution , I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people . 	0
PE	2839	Firstly , fiction books pay more attention to details . 	1
PE	2840	In fact , we can know characters , places , and times of a novel very well during reading it . 	0
PE	2841	Way to reduce the amount of traffic ? 	0
PE	2842	Big cities nowadays can be described as melting pots . 	0
PE	2843	The problem off traffic overload , caused by overpopulation , has aroused interest of many city planners . 	0
PE	2844	It is argued that only if the demand to go out on the street is cut down can we solve the seemingly insurmountable issue of traffic gridlock . 	0
PE	2845	However , I have to profoundly disagree for there are still two viable solutions besides besides this way . 	0
PE	2846	First of all , public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street . 	1
PE	2847	Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options . 	0
PE	2848	Apparently , a bus can carry no less than 30 people , while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number . 	0
PE	2849	First of all , by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life , students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject . 	1
PE	2850	Take chemistry for example , merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring , while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class . 	0
PE	2851	Moreover , in a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits . 	0
PE	2852	Regardless of some exceptions , it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities . 	1
PE	2853	University education is always an important part of one ' s life . 	0
PE	2854	Living in smal towns 	0
PE	2855	Place of living has the most significant affect on our lives and we have to choose it according to several factors . 	0
PE	2856	Some people prefer to live in tall buildings and crowded areas , whereas others prefer to live in a small and calm town . 	0
PE	2857	I would prefer to live in a small town and I think a small town has some advantages , such as good weather , a healthy life and better facilities . 	1
PE	2858	Firstly , the first advantage of living in a small town is a healthy life that we can obtain due to many items . 	0
PE	2859	One of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town . 	0
PE	2860	Also , in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic . 	0
PE	2861	Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness . 	0
PE	2862	Hence , this type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature . 	0
PE	2863	To sum up , art is a very valuable object for every country and the talent in this area cannot be discovered everywhere , so I think governments should help and encourage artists to continue their work . 	1
PE	2864	Another reason why artists should be helped is because talent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted . 	1
PE	2865	Indeed , not many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts . 	0
PE	2866	Consequently , frequent conflicts may occur during communication . 	0
PE	2867	In these games , children are rewarded to help their characters to kill or shoot monsters or characters controlled by other players , and this many lead to development of aggressive feelings , thoughts and behaviors . 	0
PE	2868	Taking into account of all these factors , we may reach the conclusion that training can be effective in encouraging further good work . 	1
PE	2869	Training can help employees refresh their mind as well as make them happy , focus on work . 	0
PE	2870	In conclusion , providing professional training as a reward for good work has many advantages . 	1
PE	2871	Of course , excellent working result will make them very happy as well as their boss . 	0
PE	2872	Having professional training help employees gain more confidence in their business , so I believe that they will finish their jobs with excellent result . 	0
PE	2873	Thirdly , providing training will make employees happy with their current job because it help them improve their professional business knowledge . 	1
PE	2874	At this circumstances , they would surf on the internet for hours and end up no where . 	0
PE	2875	As searching information on the internet , young people are probably distracted by other attractions such as online games or social webs . 	0
PE	2876	Nevertheless , this ability is also essential for young people since young people can overcome their bad habits and fulfill their goals more quickly with this ability . 	0
PE	2877	Thus , it is not need for young people to possess this ability . 	1
PE	2878	Finally , some assert that the ability to plan and organize can be learned until obtaining a job . 	0
PE	2879	Every employee can not afford this kind of loss . 	0
PE	2880	In this case , those employees who did not plan and finish their assignments ahead of time perhaps are unable to finish these tasks on time and therefore will be penalized or get fired . 	0
PE	2881	For instance , the deadline of task is shifted to an earlier date for the change of company ' s schedule . 	0
PE	2882	However , things have been changing all the time . 	0
PE	2883	If some employees lack the ability to plan and organize ahead , they may get the procrastination and therefore take into action until the deadline is imminent . 	0
PE	2884	They can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice . 	0
PE	2885	I still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor ' s research project . 	0
PE	2886	They are able to observe animals ' behaviors and features . 	0
PE	2887	The zoo also let students have a chance to learning biology practically . 	0
PE	2888	Besides , researchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches because it has diverse species of animals . 	0
PE	2889	Moreover , practical learning help students relax from a boring lecture class . 	0
PE	2890	In the zoo , there is not so harmful as a forest . 	0
PE	2891	Secondly , the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats . 	1
PE	2892	Furthermore , we can do artificial insemenation to maintain nearly extinct wildlife . 	0
PE	2893	They , fed by zookeepers , do not need to find food themselves . 	0
PE	2894	And finally , there is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e-mail . 	1
PE	2895	When you speak face-to-face you are not as able to control every word as you are when you write an e-mail . 	0
PE	2896	For example , you can change the word order or you can choose more appropriate style to sound more polite . 	0
PE	2897	Thirdly , when you write an e-mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself . 	1
PE	2898	To sum up , I would like to say that for me both options of communicating are possible , but if this is an important and not urgent question I would prefer to answer it by means of internet or voice mail . 	1
PE	2899	You should not worry about interrupting an important conversation or some other business . 	0
PE	2900	In a few years I will finish my studying in the university and I will have to decide whether to live in a small town or a big city . 	0
PE	2901	Small town vs . Big city ( opportunities , entertainment , job places ) 	0
PE	2902	Big city life provides many opportunities . 	0
PE	2903	As I am eager to get a good job and explore different places , I think I would prefer to live in a city . 	1
PE	2904	Electrical engineering deals with problems concerning electricity supply . 	0
PE	2905	First of all , it will be easier for me to find an engineering job in the city . 	0
PE	2906	At the weekends , there is a great number of things to do in the metropolis . 	1
PE	2907	Therefore , a big city can offer me many more vacancies than a small town . 	1
PE	2908	Multinational cities have restaurants with different national cuisines . 	0
PE	2909	There are numerous bars , cafes and restaurants where I can go with my friends . 	0
PE	2910	I have tried to correct him for couple times but he just thinks that I am too conservative . 	0
PE	2911	Furthermore , they are most likely to quarrel every day , instead of to help each other . 	0
PE	2912	Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident . 	0
PE	2913	Last but not least , every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time . 	0
PE	2914	Therefore , e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out . 	0
PE	2915	For instance , I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior , it ' s hard for me to face her and explain what she should do . 	0
PE	2916	I don ' t have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive . 	0
PE	2917	She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed . 	0
PE	2918	In addition , writing e-mail helps people express honestly . 	1
PE	2919	Moreover , e-mail doesn ' t take too much time : just a click . 	0
PE	2920	Sometimes , their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect . 	0
PE	2921	Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid . 	0
PE	2922	If someone exchange my friends with thousands of acquaintances , I will definitely say NO . 	0
PE	2923	If I could decide I would chose living in the city for sure . 	0
PE	2924	Today living in the rural places is in most causes connected with agrarian lifestyle , which for me is without perspective . 	0
PE	2925	Taking all into account , I think that living in the city is much better nowadays , because of the opportunities it gives . 	1
PE	2926	Moreover , peaceful and close to the nature areas could help to avoid worries and sadness . 	0
PE	2927	However , in the countryside there are many places to rest , because of its location . 	1
PE	2928	The buses and trains are more frequent than in the countryside , so the city provides better communication . 	1
PE	2929	This truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues . 	0
PE	2930	If I worked in the different field from my father , I would have faced much difficulty than I do now . 	0
PE	2931	Also , they do not have to educate and they do not have to work , so they have a lot of time in their hand to enjoy this stage of their life . 	1
PE	2932	In addition , in this age they are not expected to be responsible . 	1
PE	2933	As much as their events might were bitter , in their adulthood they are sweet . 	0
PE	2934	When individuals reminisce their memories they absolutely infer to some of their childhood events . 	0
PE	2935	You hardly ever can find a person who says that he or she had unpleasant childhood . 	0
PE	2936	Children are free 	0
PE	2937	Therefore there is no argument and punishment for them . 	1
PE	2938	Because they are in the age of growth and they are allowed whatever they want to do to experience new stuffs . 	0
PE	2939	In the first place , children are free whatever they want to do , they are not restricted and their limitation are really rare . 	0
PE	2940	In my opinion , childhood is definitely the happiest time of people life in two main areas . 	1
PE	2941	Choosing the job that is similar to parents ' jobs could benefit to one ' s career 	0
PE	2942	When choosing a job , one need to consider it thoroughly . 	0
PE	2943	So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information , rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers ' taste . 	1
PE	2944	In conclusion , the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources . 	1
PE	2945	It would be helpful , however , if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures . 	0
PE	2946	For example , electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years . 	0
PE	2947	With people raising their awareness of the green economy , the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients , which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today , triggering sales . 	0
PE	2948	If a firm is environmentally conscious , it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment , which can boost productivity . 	0
PE	2949	Furthermore , taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies . 	1
PE	2950	On the other hand , without the requirement of environmental preservation , the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs , being a hurdle to the economic development . 	0
PE	2951	Therefore , it may spur its economic development . 	0
PE	2952	On the other hand , I suppose the developed countries should support the underdeveloped areas by providing financial resources , technologies and experience so that the environmental problems can be effectively alleviated in these areas . 	0
PE	2953	Therefore , I would conclude that thriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously . 	1
PE	2954	Not only that , as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance , they will less likely steal from the shops . 	0
PE	2955	To illustrate this further , in Malaysia , policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight . 	0
PE	2956	Today , close circuit television ( CCTV ) cameras are widely used in a variety of circumstances . 	0
PE	2957	Use of CCTV cameras 	0
PE	2958	It is undeniable that the use of CCTV has plenty of benefits to offer , especially in reducing crimes and protecting the employees in a premise . 	0
PE	2959	They are used in schools , businesses and some other premises in order to monitor the activities taking place . 	0
PE	2960	Even so , I strongly believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace . 	1
PE	2961	Nevertheless , some argue that these cameras invade their privacies due to constantly being monitored . 	0
PE	2962	This is because when a shop is attacked by thieves , the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced . 	0
PE	2963	Firstly , by having CCTV cameras at workplace , crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down . 	0
PE	2964	There are a lot of tourists who seek to see those animals closely . 	0
PE	2965	Last but not least , because of all weird , acute , and beautiful animals in the zoo , it can be a great tourist attraction . 	0
PE	2966	Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers . 	0
PE	2967	Tax revenue is collected from those who works . 	0
PE	2968	Besides , high school must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum . 	0
PE	2969	Besides , there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure , such as health care service and education , so addressing unemployment should have low priority . 	0
PE	2970	Unemployment is clearly a global problem , be it in developed countries or developing ones . 	0
PE	2971	Should governments be responsible to help the unemployed and homeless 	0
PE	2972	Government money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only . 	1
PE	2973	However , I tend to believe it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens , rather than the government , to help them out . 	1
PE	2974	Of course , this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance . 	1
PE	2975	If they could get free financial help from the government , they might end up with out any motivation to work at all . 	0
PE	2976	To sum up both contentions about the necessity of universities ' education have reasonable justifications ; however , I agree with the latter view . 	0
PE	2977	Although higher education does not guarantee young students ' success , the benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges . 	1
PE	2978	More importantly , many researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society . 	0
PE	2979	Another significant factor of universities is that diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently because there are a number of chances through internships , deeper discussion , independent life , and exchange scholarships . 	0
PE	2980	It is my belief the tendency of getting extra jobs will increase more in the future . 	0
PE	2981	Lastly , doing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation . 	1
PE	2982	Indeed , high studying tuition , added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students . 	0
PE	2983	By constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation , then students ' confidence could be significantly gained . 	0
PE	2984	Also , working conditions require students the independency in thinking , working , and solving problems , which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities . 	0
PE	2985	In conclusion , I feel certain that having a part time job during your student time will offer students many clear benefits . 	1
PE	2986	By taking on an extra job , students can partly alleviate some their problematic matters such as working experience , confidence and accommodation . 	1
PE	2987	With the money they earn from extra jobs , which normally is not much , those difficulties could be partially solved . 	0
PE	2988	Moreover , that helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well-prepared condition for their independent later life . 	1
PE	2989	On the next day , we played together and she introduced me to her friends . 	0
PE	2990	Thanks to her and outdoor activities such as going skiing , climbing the mountain , I had a lot of friends since The National Camp . 	0
PE	2991	I belive that practicing these sports helped me greatly . 	0
PE	2992	Something else that is good is that playing these sports is to keep my body fit , make me ultimately refreshed . 	0
PE	2993	After that summer , my body is stronger and endurance is better . 	0
PE	2994	Outdoor activities not only improves my health but also gives me chances to communicate with more people . 	1
PE	2995	When I was ten years old , I was a shy girl . 	0
PE	2996	My mother took me to The National Camp . 	0
PE	2997	At first , I just ate and played alone . 	0
PE	2998	But on the third day , while I was swimming , a friendly girl came and greeted me , we became friend later and she taught me how to swim effectively . 	0
PE	2999	And I believe my friend will do the same to me . 	0
PE	3000	This way of writing will encourage them to pay more attention on content , elaborate in details and develop their organization abilities . 	0
PE	3001	Secondly , parents and schools should give priority on directing their kids about handwriting as poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students ' school performance . 	1
PE	3002	So this example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects . 	0
PE	3003	On other side of the coin , many people believe that usage of machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing similar amount of work . 	0
PE	3004	Take the example of use of food processors in kitchens . 	0
PE	3005	The work of chopping , blending , grating , kneading has become so easy that people can not imagine their lives without this simple machine at their homes . 	0
PE	3006	Thus it is very obvious that using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome . 	1
PE	3007	After analyzing these two points of view , it is believed that using machines is advantageous as machines make work easy and smooth . 	1
PE	3008	The negative effects on health can be put on the back seat because there are many other ways to exercise and stay healthy . 	1
PE	3009	Therefore , it is hoped that in coming time people will enjoy using more and more machines and will choose alternative ways to stay disease free . 	0
PE	3010	The message is when you always studying harder than others you will get best results . 	0
PE	3011	As a rule of thumb , huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities . 	0
PE	3012	The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people . 	1
PE	3013	Second , rarely do we realize the helpful existence of urban areas . 	0
PE	3014	It is believed that if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt , the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now . 	0
PE	3015	In conclusion , city planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas . 	1
PE	3016	It is highly recommended to put forward such solution , especially in some developing countries like Vietnam or China , with the ever-growing demand for job or education . 	0
PE	3017	Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose , most of them are attracted by facebook , blog , etc . instead . 	0
PE	3018	Due to this neglect , they will have a bad result in school because when they can not live without internet , they will have no time for their studying . 	0
PE	3019	In conclusion , although it is undeniable that computer is a crucial part of human life , it still has its bad side , especially for children . 	1
PE	3020	People should learn how to use it properly to make it an effective tool because computer should be used not only for entertaining but also for working and studying purpose . 	0
PE	3021	Internet facilities such as msn , skype made visual communication possible . 	0
PE	3022	For example , via skype people not just communicate with their family members and friends , but also make interviews for employment , enrolment into universities . 	0
PE	3023	With the use of email our messages can be delivered to any person in any part of the world in few minutes . 	0
PE	3024	In addition , it is convenient because you do not need to mile to the post office , but just click the mouse of your computer from the convenience of your arm chair in order to reach your friends , family members in any part of the world . 	0
PE	3025	In result , communication has become cheaper , faster and visual . 	1
PE	3026	Finally , I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient in the ways that it broadened the sources of information and made access more quick , a long with the improving quality of the communication in many ways . 	1
PE	3027	Because in classroom have many equipment to demonstrate real example . 	0
PE	3028	To begin with , learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt . 	1
PE	3029	I will give reasons to support my opinion . 	0
PE	3030	Consequently , I completely disagree with this statement that we should replace normal course with online course . 	1
PE	3031	Besides , learning in classroom are not only learning academic skills but also learning social skills , and learning how to solve problem in real situation . 	0
PE	3032	Learning in classroom could provide more information to study . 	0
PE	3033	Should replace normal classroom with online computer classes ? 	0
PE	3034	In conclusion , the needs for having developed-skills and gaining degree certificate in order to build someone ' s career are totally needed to implement and applied for any gender . 	1
PE	3035	Those standard jobs will always be available for everyone , while complex ones should be only handled by the best people , who start their career from the best institutions . 	0
PE	3036	To sum thing up , I agree that everyone should have a compulsory education level up to high school , but the above divisions should be only the realm of the best students . 	1
PE	3037	Ultimately , this improves the overall quality of education and gives the best people to serve in the most necessary needs of the society . 	0
PE	3038	Another reason is order to gaining higher education degree as it is required to establish a person ' s career . 	0
PE	3039	These days , it is so hard for young people to get a proper job when they have not degree certificate from Universities . 	0
PE	3040	So , learning from human ' s history , education provides someone to widen his or her knowledge and experience for facing the real situation of workplace through subject taught in college . 	0
PE	3041	According to this opinion , giving equal education for both men and women is a must . 	1
PE	3042	I totally agree that using of these soft devices have cut much of time people need to see with their relatives . 	1
PE	3043	However , it is had some demerits on their social lives . 	1
PE	3044	Modern forms of communication ; ' electronic letter ' 	0
PE	3045	Undoubtedly , the movement of modern forms of communication has changed better , which help people to interact to others , such as email and messaging without limitation time . 	0
PE	3046	Another perspective , using of these facilities has influenced netizens to keep themselves becoming unsociable . 	0
PE	3047	It caused they were swept away by virtual atmosphere , so they do not do much social live interactions with others . 	0
PE	3048	Mentioned to societies life style , they constantly use these kinds of electronic letter for making fellowship or just continuing theirs what they already had . 	0
PE	3049	Obviousness , there are other ways like social media that they could to use it for meeting theirs buddies such as Twitter and Facebook , also make the communication become feasible and limitless of time . 	1
PE	3050	The consequence of this case made some people become geek , as too much of using email and messaging , without direct contacts . 	1
PE	3051	However , people have had own minded to keep connection with their friends as a good relationship , meet them and talk by face to face directly . 	0
PE	3052	This is because they are doing what they love , their income however seems to be quite low compared to many other career paths . 	0
PE	3053	It is obvious that people who are woking in art or painting industries , for example , will find it quite difficult to live comfortably and enjoyably . 	0
PE	3054	More specifically , people tend to choose high salary jobs so as to not only help themselves but also support partially or wholly their family ' s living needs such as food , clothes , accommodation , education , medication . 	1
PE	3055	On one hand , i agree that money is very essential in order to meet human ' basic needs . 	0
PE	3056	In the following paragraphs , some of my viewpoints would be given and analyzed respectively . 	0
PE	3057	I personally suppose that there are still many other aspects which should be seen as important as income when people choose a job . 	1
PE	3058	Along with the increasing physical demands of human life , salary has become the most influential consideration in defining careers of everyone . 	0
PE	3059	Salary is the most important consideration when choosing a job 	0
PE	3060	There are plenty of people , who are now really successful , have started working in challenging as well as competitive fields as singers , dancers and painters . 	0
PE	3061	On the other hand , i believe that if we are passionate about what we are working , we are likely to achieve success easily in that field . 	1
PE	3062	Moreover , after taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents . 	0
PE	3063	As you can see , part time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially . 	0
PE	3064	In sum , I am sure ; some people will oppose the idea of part time job for students . 	0
PE	3065	They will argue , it can destruct students from their study . 	1
PE	3066	However , as i did part time job in my high school and it did not hurt my academic result ; therefore , i believe part time job will be good for students . 	1
PE	3067	Every Student should do part time job beside their study if they want to prepare more efficiently for their future . 	0
PE	3068	Consequently , dancing are the part of people belief . 	1
PE	3069	Or some part of the world that are in arid area believe that if they danced , the rain would come . 	0
PE	3070	Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxid into environment that cause the Earth to heat up . 	0
PE	3071	However , the biggest concern is the effect on global warming . 	0
PE	3072	In conclusion , I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits . 	1
PE	3073	In fact , while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories , nothing is being done to reins the airlines . 	0
PE	3074	Instead , people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices . 	0
PE	3075	However , it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive . 	0
PE	3076	Many cultures do dance to show a great prosperous of its culture . 	0
PE	3077	Dancing is also one of important parts of culture that represent to something that people believe . 	0
PE	3078	In any case , a musician playing " I swear " several times receives different earnings that Padang got because the musician re-plays the song without any creation . 	0
PE	3079	Striking contrast , labor working in the merchandise factory receive coin of dollar even they make a hundred of 15 cm Buddha temples a day . 	0
PE	3080	He granted huge sums for such idea . 	0
PE	3081	Pieter Padang , Minion creator , has brilliant idea to alter part of song lyric " I swear " become " underwear " when the Minion sing in Despicable Me . 	0
PE	3082	I agree that government cannot take steps to make the salary between modern artists and other job similar because art price is about taste . 	1
PE	3083	Having said that the huge sums of modern artists receives related to their struggle in the field of art , while the term of struggle might different with other field of job . 	1
PE	3084	Moreover , government cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist because there is no certain parameter to value it , art value is about taste . 	1
PE	3085	To conclude , CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise . 	1
PE	3086	This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers . 	1
PE	3087	Admittedly , privacies are lost with the use of these cameras . 	0
PE	3088	Nonetheless , safety should be put first in order to be safe . 	0
PE	3089	In my point of view , though competitive child would have more motivation and perspective that leads them to success , but it would not help them much once they enter to society or company which required more about skill of team work . 	1
PE	3090	For example , famous singers or movie stars , despite of their talent to make them successful , there are always a team to manage works or deal with things . 	0
PE	3091	To sum up , I would say that schools and adults should put a sense of cooperation in children to make them becoming a useful adult whether in society or community . 	1
PE	3092	To give a brief conclusion , Modern technogy has impacted the traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways . 	1
PE	3093	Modern devices also assist the scientists to study the ancient societies much more deeply , hence discovering more cultural traces . 	0
PE	3094	With the help of advanced methods , many art masterpiece has been well restorated and well preserved . 	0
PE	3095	Individuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends , which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes . 	0
PE	3096	Despite this , it is undeniable that following fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals ' personalities . 	0
PE	3097	With those arguments in mind , I would conclude that people should , especially for ones lacking basic aesthetic knowledge , care more about fashion trends in lives as they can keep pace with the world ' s changes . 	1
PE	3098	Consequently , the world would look monotonous . 	1
PE	3099	On the other hand , creative design talents can value their own dressing ideas , developing their own fashion styles as they like . 	1
PE	3100	Many animals today are in danger of extinction owing to various reasons . 	0
PE	3101	Protect animals or not ? 	0
PE	3102	In my opinion , we should give priority to our own issues . 	1
PE	3103	While some people believe it is important to protect these endangered species , others argue that problems of human beings deserve more attention . 	0
PE	3104	If certain species are absent from this system , such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species , including human beings , will come under threat . 	0
PE	3105	Animal protectionists may base their argument on the ground that biodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem . 	0
PE	3106	However , I think species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution . 	1
PE	3107	Therefore , it is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible . 	1
PE	3108	A great number of plants and animals died out because they were unable to fit into the new environment . 	0
PE	3109	The environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being . 	0
PE	3110	In conclusion , I agree with that the technology has more optimal effects on people ' s interaction , because it helps ordinary people to make new friends and to maintain relationships . 	1
PE	3111	In this way , technology is beneficial to humanity develops positive relationships . 	1
PE	3112	Also , they can connect with friends who have been out of touch for a long time by using the Internet . 	0
PE	3113	In the past , people might have had pen friends in other countries , but now , thanks to the social networking websites , people can easily to find someone who has similar interests . 	0
PE	3114	Therefore , the progress of news media is an advantageous development . 	1
PE	3115	Although some people view that government should be take a responsibility for this unfair situation , critics against such view . 	0
PE	3116	In a field of art , modern artist may receive high salary for their masterpiece creation while labors should be break their bone for years to get similar amount of money . 	0
PE	3117	The amount of money people earning sometimes is unfair . 	0
PE	3118	High sum of money of modern artist 	0
PE	3119	Also , the high sum which modern artists receive is related to the quality instead of the quantity and their rare talent . 	0
PE	3120	It is true while the modern artists who implement their creative thinking onto high value creation are paid with immense sum by the art collector . 	0
PE	3121	Proficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work . 	1
PE	3122	I agree that in this occasion the government is not granted to hand in . 	1
PE	3123	On the other hand , modern artists also devote themselves find a unique concept in which ordinary people cannot do , such making impossible become possible . 	0
PE	3124	For example , a 15 centimeter Buddha temple made by hand is granted times in comparison with factory production . 	0
PE	3125	Some people regard stress as a power , which overcomes the obstacles to motivate themselves to do their best ; other people cannot charge of their thoughts , emotions , and the way they deal with problems . 	0
PE	3126	In the frenetic , fast-paced world , it is a very common predicament that all of us , from the young to the senior , feel depressed caused by stress , such as financial problems , exam stress , relationship difficulties and work overload . 	0
PE	3127	But , we still need preserve other languages for sake of keeping the linguistic and cultural diversity . 	1
PE	3128	Personally , English as an elegant language should be advocated in many fields to expand the global trade and communications . 	1
PE	3129	Even English is a sophisticated language ; it does not express every detail of life especially in Asia countries , which have totally different linguistic system . 	0
PE	3130	However , the opponents believe that the dominated status of English has destroyed culture diversity and many less-used languages become extinct . 	1
PE	3131	Obviously , these languages have special significance for people who belong to them and using English to replace them is crudity . 	0
PE	3132	It is undeniable that language contains many aspects of people ' s daily life , which is influenced by culture , environment as well as religious . 	0
PE	3133	Moreover , rigorous exercise can also hone one ' s will , which enable people to be able to tackle stringent problems and arduous tasks . 	1
PE	3134	Thus good exercises can often successfully alleviating one ' s heavy burdens . 	0
PE	3135	This hormone can delight one ' s mind , creating positive feelings . 	0
PE	3136	When people exercise , the neuron cells in the brain release a chemical compound named Dopamine . 	0
PE	3137	Nevertheless , I assert that the best way of diminishing stress is by exercises , which can benefit everyone not only physically but also mentally . 	1
PE	3138	In a nutshell , many activities can let humans relax . 	1
PE	3139	For example , the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign . 	0
PE	3140	Therefore , a government ' s role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people ' s lives . 	1
PE	3141	Therefore , society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients . 	1
PE	3142	I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients . 	0
PE	3143	In my opinion , there is nothing more important than health in a human ' s life and the happiness and welfare come with health . 	0
PE	3144	The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society . 	0
PE	3145	In today ' s world , the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens . 	0
PE	3146	A greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues 	0
PE	3147	The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system . 	0
PE	3148	I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions . 	1
PE	3149	Therefore , one who has studied and lived overseas will become more eligible for the job than his / her peers . 	1
PE	3150	Becoming successful in this study will give the student an edge in job market . 	0
PE	3151	To begin with , it is vital that professors should assist students to acquire knowledge . 	0
PE	3152	The professors ’ duty is to nurture students , and prepare excellent courses . 	0
PE	3153	Similarly , how can we live safely and joyfully when our home is devastated by , ironically , by ourselves ? 	0
PE	3154	In conclusion , I think that in order to be a competitive worker , students must know their field in an advanced level . 	0
PE	3155	To my mind , students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects , rather than playing on guitar or singing a song . 	0
PE	3156	Nowadays , time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace . 	0
PE	3157	Therefore , music and other entertaining subjects should be optional . 	1
PE	3158	Increasingly however , students can not obtain supposed impacts , unless they get interested in it more seriously . 	0
PE	3159	Hence , I agree with the majority , because music is the art which requires special attitude towards it . 	0
PE	3160	In our hectic life , however , demand is not for musically orientated students , but for academically developed employees . 	0
PE	3161	By contrast , it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students . 	0
PE	3162	All in all , I am in the conviction that sports and social activities should obtain analogous concern and money in the view of above-mentioned reasons . 	1
PE	3163	They bring a lot of advantages and benefits for students and also affect their future in a positive way . 	1
PE	3164	There won ' t be any effect if school does so . 	0
PE	3165	Do arts and music improve the quality of life ? 	0
PE	3166	My view is that the government should give priorities to invest more money on the basic social welfares such as education and housing instead of subsidizing arts relative programs . 	1
PE	3167	Art is not the key determination of quality of life , but education is . 	1
PE	3168	In order to make people better off , it is more urgent for governments to commit money to some fundamental help such as setting more scholarships in education section for all citizens . 	0
PE	3169	This is simply because knowledge and wisdom is the guarantee of the enhancement of the quality of people ' s lives for a well-rounded social system . 	0
PE	3170	Admittedly , art , to some extent , serve a valuable function about enriching one ' s daily lives , for example , it could bring release one ' s heavy burden of study pressure and refresh human bodies through a hard day from work . 	1
PE	3171	However , it is unrealistic to pursuit of this high standard of life in many developing countries , in which the basic housing supply has still been a huge problem with plenty of lower income family have squeezed in a small tight room . 	0
PE	3172	By comparison to these issues , the pursuit of art seems unimportant at all . 	0
PE	3173	To conclude , art could play an active role in improving the quality of people ' s lives , but I think that governments should attach heavier weight to other social issues such as education and housing needs because those are the most essential ways enable to make people a decent life . 	1
PE	3174	The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account . 	1
PE	3175	First , there are several uncertainties about your professional future . 	0
PE	3176	Some of them had no own savings . 	0
PE	3177	As example I remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe . 	0
PE	3178	In recent years the majority of developed countries have a low saving rate because the people opt to spend their earnings immediately or they even take loans to finance their expenses . 	0
PE	3179	Saving / Spending money 	0
PE	3180	Im my opinion , saving some part of your earnings is essential due to the fact that you can not predict future developments , neither in your professional nor your personal life , furthermore with savings you can fulfill some of your dreams . 	1
PE	3181	But isn ' t it better to save your money for later investments or rough times ? 	0
PE	3182	In addition , you can not be sure about the development in your personal life . 	0
PE	3183	They could not afford the rent , so they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence . 	0
PE	3184	There was news about raising professors ' salary in my country . 	0
PE	3185	In actual , republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960 ' s . 	0
PE	3186	Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business . 	1
PE	3187	To be out of poverty , it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light , electricity , load , highways , natural resources , technology and buildings for companies . 	0
PE	3188	First of all , poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer . 	0
PE	3189	However , I agree that aiding poor countries has positive effects , overweighing its side-effects for the several reasons . 	1
PE	3190	In addition , a great amount of materials and money have poor countries being corrupted and politically dependent on other countries . 	1
PE	3191	It is true that just giving aid to impoverished countries could be manipulated by big power countries . 	1
PE	3192	That is why governmental and non-governmental organizations have been focus on being harmony and contribute to aid to poor countries . 	0
PE	3193	In this world , there is no one who does not know this world ' globalization ' , which means the world are more closer , and every single countries affects each other more than before in many ways . 	0
PE	3194	Giving aid to poorer countries has more negative effects than positive effect 	0
PE	3195	I believe that experiencing the real life by myself , I could learn more than just obey the advice . 	1
PE	3196	Parents and other predecessors used to experience their own life by themselves , why don ' t the younger try to do the same ? 	0
PE	3197	For one thing , there are so many grate things that you can missed if you don ' t experience it by yourself . 	0
PE	3198	For example , a friend told you not to try skydiving because it was so dangerous . 	0
PE	3199	If you did as he told , you could fail to see how wonderful it is to be fall freely . 	0
PE	3200	In addition , family and friends accidentally harm you by giving you advice all the time . 	0
PE	3201	You will grow to be dependent and reliant . 	0
PE	3202	In contrast , free yourself and do what you desire without notice about consequences is the way that success people would like to choose . 	0
PE	3203	According to myself , both ways are good , but I prefer the latter . 	0
PE	3204	It is because growth is a long process that experience is indispensable . 	0
PE	3205	However , I believe that it is not a good idea because most young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents . 	0
PE	3206	Moreover , parents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills . 	0
PE	3207	Thus , school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student as it is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life . 	1
PE	3208	Some people may argue that students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents . 	1
PE	3209	In conclusion , I strongly believe that non-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student ’ s development . 	1
PE	3210	Therefore , schools should not remove these subjects . 	1
PE	3211	For instance , paper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers , causing severe water pollution . 	0
PE	3212	On the other hand , the dramatic majority of tourist , particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages , are well educated . 	0
PE	3213	Some people may oppose these , citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism . 	1
PE	3214	In fact , compared to the tourism industry , other alternatives , like resource extraction and manufacture , are far worse destroyers . 	0
PE	3215	In conclusion , it is evident that under suitable administration , the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks . 	1
PE	3216	It is illogical to believe that these rational folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do so . 	0
PE	3217	After careful consideration of both sides of the argument , the tourism sector is desirable for its important socioeconomic advantages . 	1
PE	3218	Although those above reasons are acceptable , I would argue that there are many things much more important than having a job . 	0
PE	3219	Firstly , studying music , art or sports is also very important to students . 	0
PE	3220	This is understandable when labor market now has high competition ; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification . 	0
PE	3221	In addition , the unemployment rate is always high , so their parents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job . 	0
PE	3222	Although I accept that students have to study many subjects in school , I disagree with the idea that unimportant subjects such as music and sports should be got rid of the program . 	1
PE	3223	Many people believe that students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics , physics because these subject are necessary for students ' future . 	1
PE	3224	Schools should only teach children the academic subject 	0
PE	3225	People have many different views about what subjects should be taught in school . 	0
PE	3226	This enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them . 	0
PE	3227	Secondly , to get a job in labor market , not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork , presentation . 	0
PE	3228	As for me , I would follow the new customs , if I migrated to another country . 	1
PE	3229	Some people choose the former one to assimilate themselves into the new culture , while some insist the latter one because the new customs are difficult to be accepted . 	0
PE	3230	Furthermore , they can meet different people of the country . 	0
PE	3231	They can learn about their way of thinking , their customs and traditions , and way of life . 	0
PE	3232	Learning about others ' cultures is so important . 	0
PE	3233	It contributes in building a new understanding in us of how we see the world . 	0
PE	3234	For example , they will get exposed to a different educational system . 	0
PE	3235	They will meet new professors and new classmates which makes the academic experience different from that in their home country . 	0
PE	3236	Most important is the cultural aspect of the experience . 	1
PE	3237	While living in a foreign country , students can learn a lot about the culture of that country . 	0
PE	3238	It makes us more open , and willing to accept different ideas and thoughts . 	0
PE	3239	Also it educates us about the world we are living in . 	0
PE	3240	Consequently , conducting research is helpful for professors and students to some extent . 	0
PE	3241	In other word , professor should concern about preparing class . 	1
PE	3242	Only by developing students , can we have a better academic field . 	1
PE	3243	However , the precondition of doing research is growing students ’ solid theory fundamental . 	0
PE	3244	And some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions . 	0
PE	3245	They can manage the electric theory in practical skills . 	0
PE	3246	This is requires professors provide high quality courses . 	0
PE	3247	However , only under specific circumstance , when students master all of the systematic knowledge , can they accomplish research . 	0
PE	3248	Professors could combine doing research and preparing good courses in a dynamic way . 	1
PE	3249	In the future , many countries will try to prevent attach of other countries by using and invention new missiles . 	0
PE	3250	Space exploration has used as a tools for military power in the cold war . 	0
PE	3251	Therefore , it is very significant to find a new place for living in other planets . 	1
PE	3252	In during history , our planet is threatening by many of other planets or stars and it is an enormous danger for living of humanity . 	0
PE	3253	In 20th century , although human being succeeded to achieve out of space by means of new technologies such as rockets , but finding a new place for living in another planet is impossible until now . 	0
PE	3254	Many governments believe that space exploration is an activity that wastes the budget , while the essential challenge of humanity in the future would be the discovery of a new place for the living . 	0
PE	3255	In my opinion , spending the budget for space exploration is an important activity to save living of humanity in the future . 	1
PE	3256	The United state and Russia are the important countries that spend large budgets for the research of this subject . 	0
PE	3257	Space exploration , for discovery of out of space , has been possible for human in the 20th century . 	0
PE	3258	Nowadays , spending budget on space exploration is not reasonable 	0
PE	3259	In the following paragraphs , both sides of the above matter as well as my own view ' s explanations would be analyzed and given , respectively . 	0
PE	3260	Firstly , it is undoubtedly that thanks to modern technology invented recently , human life has been improved dramatically . 	1
PE	3261	Air-conditioners , computers , cellphones , washing machines , for example , is likely to be seen as greatest inventions helping people to reduce stress and time for other activities . 	0
PE	3262	Moreover , applying technological science into the preparation of medications also plays a significant role in saving the number of patients ' lives . 	0
PE	3263	Negative effects of technological process 	0
PE	3264	It is undeniable that technological process has brought numerous benefits making human life become more and more comfortable and easy . 	0
PE	3265	Some individuals assume that this technological development also causes many drawbacks impacting seriously on our lives . 	0
PE	3266	I personally disagree with this view . 	0
PE	3267	As far as I am concerned , both choices have their own advantages and disadvantages . 	1
PE	3268	On the one hand , living in a dormitory helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university . 	0
PE	3269	Dormitory or apartment ? 	0
PE	3270	When it comes to the issue of choosing an accommodation after completion of their high school , most students always get confused between these two options : living in an apartment , or in university dormitories . 	0
PE	3271	However , some negative aspects of technological process need to be mentioned clearly . 	0
PE	3272	In spite of bring fantastic advantages , technological products have devastated the natural environment indirectly through its production process . 	1
PE	3273	For instance , students can have an opportunity to take part in many kind of extracurricular activities happing around the campus such as attending conversation club , or joining sports club . 	0
PE	3274	Students can also have more chance of interaction with their teachers and classmates . 	0
PE	3275	The research projects like windows opened to the wider world . 	1
PE	3276	Although my university is not in the high-ranking list , he gained a reputation by those projects . 	0
PE	3277	It is very common to see state-of-the-art laboratories in the campus . 	0
PE	3278	Secondly , professors should fully use the research-friendly environment provided by universities . 	1
PE	3279	Consequently , there is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages . 	0
PE	3280	Also , you could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together . 	0
PE	3281	Universities positively contribute the professors ' success . 	0
PE	3282	We all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin . 	0
PE	3283	With the help of research projects , professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom . 	0
PE	3284	Last but not least , doing research could also improve the teaching quality . 	1
PE	3285	Because children are poor at time management , and are less mature to make a good judgment , they cannot be too serious to be taken care when watching TV and movies . 	1
PE	3286	However , it doesn ' t mean that children should do it overtime and without being taken care what they are watching . 	0
PE	3287	In considering whether the time children watching on TV or movies should be constrained , I hold a strongly positive point of view toward this issue . 	1
PE	3288	Spending equal amount of money on libraries and sports ? 	0
PE	3289	University students can be divided into two groups , one group with less interest to study and the other which include hard working students . 	0
PE	3290	Usually the second group ' s members do not have enough time to do exercise . 	0
PE	3291	We all know doing exercise for at least 30 minutes form the basis of the healthy and happy life . 	0
PE	3292	But I don ' t think that equal amount of money should be spent on academic issues like libraries and laboratories and physical or social activities . 	1
PE	3293	First , in my view spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football / basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports . 	1
PE	3294	For example , my roommate , Mary , always wakes up 6 in the morning and spends 1 hour doing sport in the park which is near our dormitory . 	0
PE	3295	When she gets to the dorm , she is really full of energy and after taking a shower , she is ready to start a good day . 	0
PE	3296	As you see , she is doing exercise without spending a cent . 	0
PE	3297	What the university should do is informing the students the benefits of doing sport by hanging some posters in the campus , inviting some athletes to lecture for students and encourage them to spend some time for their body and health . 	0
PE	3298	A world sportive competition event is watched by almost every country around the world and provide social stimulus and people gathering . 	0
PE	3299	Popular events are essential 	0
PE	3300	Obviously these events gather people and their nationalist pride feeling is increased . 	0
PE	3301	These emotions are shared locally in our village or city , nationally in our own country but even internationally too . 	0
PE	3302	The main purpose of such competitions is to enjoy and share emotions between supporters though their favorite team . 	0
PE	3303	As a matter of fact , world sport events provide positive waves for number of people . 	1
PE	3304	One of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content . 	1
PE	3305	They have a serious impact on people in their puberty . 	0
PE	3306	For example , an internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal , where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off . 	0
PE	3307	Another supporting reason is that television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture . 	1
PE	3308	Amount of control on media information 	0
PE	3309	Nowadays , one of the most controversial issues related to mass media is the correct amount of control posed on newspapers , televisions and websites . 	0
PE	3310	It is argued that the government should exercise less restriction on sharing of media information to public . 	0
PE	3311	However , I strongly believe that it should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures . 	1
PE	3312	A few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser . 	0
PE	3313	This is actually very environmentally unfriendly . 	0
PE	3314	First and foremost , it is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor , engineer and lawyer . 	1
PE	3315	Nevertheless , I feel that one can also shine without even having to attend universities . 	1
PE	3316	Not only that , when they are in a university , they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners . 	0
PE	3317	Without proper training and knowledge , it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers . 	0
PE	3318	In today ' s modern and competitive society , it is undeniable that we must equip ourselves with plenty of knowledge and skills in order to shine and to be successful in life . 	0
PE	3319	University education is needed for success 	0
PE	3320	I do agree to that opinion to a certain degree . 	0
PE	3321	Many opine that the aforementioned aspects are mostly obtained through learning in academic institutions . 	0
PE	3322	Computers have made humans over-dependent . 	1
PE	3323	However , everything has pros and cons . 	0
PE	3324	There is no end to the evolution of computers . 	0
PE	3325	Research on making computerized drone soldiers ( unmanned computer controlled ) is going on . 	0
PE	3326	Looking from another perspective , there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university . 	1
PE	3327	This can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals . 	0
PE	3328	Moreover , future prospects of computers are very bright . 	1
PE	3329	Computers provide speed , increase efficiency , accuracy , precision , help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it . 	1
PE	3330	Also , it is obvious that , to survive in this competitive world , one has to work hard and equip themselves well . 	1
PE	3331	That is how , computer impacts children on a positive note . 	1
PE	3332	This will be proven by analyzing how computer assists children to use vast resources available over internet to study effectively as well as develop some basic skills which help them in future careers . 	1
PE	3333	The best thing about internet is the availability of information in the form of text , image or video related to almost everything and through computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about . 	0
PE	3334	Around the globe , the effect is evident on children also . 	0
PE	3335	It is disagreed that computer can affect children in a negative way if they use a computer on a daily basis . 	1
PE	3336	Using a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects 	0
PE	3337	In today ' s world , computer is an essential part of everyday life . 	0
PE	3338	For instance , some people abandon their job , family and friends and go to other country without knowing what the future holds for them . 	0
PE	3339	The car use will definitely decrease in twenty years 	0
PE	3340	Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether cars will be less than there are today in twenty years or not . 	0
PE	3341	Some people believe that since the environmental concern has risen , the car use will decrease . 	0
PE	3342	While others think that a personal car is important for ones daily life . 	0
PE	3343	Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason . 	0
PE	3344	But as far as I am concerned , I agree with the idea , which is that there will be a decrease in cars use in the future . 	1
PE	3345	The following reasons will present my points . 	0
PE	3346	First of all , since the public transportation has improved , it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus . 	1
PE	3347	For accomplishing their missions , the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks . 	0
PE	3348	They bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit . 	0
PE	3349	A solid group can be a suited environment , which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons . 	0
PE	3350	By participating in an organization , it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose . 	1
PE	3351	When being in the department of art , I have not only learned how to do a project , but also known some famous artists during the term . 	0
PE	3352	For example , as a student majoring in mass media , I have taken part in mass media student group for a year . 	0
PE	3353	Furthermore , groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal . 	1
PE	3354	Above all , it is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job . 	0
PE	3355	Tzu Chi , a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan , is famous for contributing to the social and community services , and medical care . 	0
PE	3356	Here is an example : there are various charities in the world . 	0
PE	3357	Importantly , when students start their university studies after a break , they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge . 	0
PE	3358	Nevertheless , during high school , many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in . 	0
PE	3359	A continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot , to follow instructions . 	0
PE	3360	Personally , a break will give students some time to refresh their systems , by traveling or following their hobbies . 	1
PE	3361	In most education systems , a child studies continuously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age . 	0
PE	3362	A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change . 	0
PE	3363	Some countries permit students to take a break from studies between high school and university studies , while in some countries , it is considered as waste of time . 	0
PE	3364	However , a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school . 	1
PE	3365	Is a break good or bad after high school for students 	0
PE	3366	Studies are an essential part of life . 	0
PE	3367	This will improve the quality of both universities and students , thus placing people in positions which suit them most . 	1
PE	3368	It is necessary for every citizen to have the awareness and knowledge of environment protection . 	0
PE	3369	This means that we should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society , and the government controls many influential media , such as TV stations and newspapers , which can provide plenty of environmental knowledge and related policies to citizens . 	1
PE	3370	There is a viewpoint that the government and big firms should assume the responsibility to protect the environment and normal citizens have nothing to do for that . 	0
PE	3371	Personally , I think both government and common people should have the responsibility for the environment , but we need to analyze some specific situations . 	1
PE	3372	The environment problems facing today ' s world are so great 	0
PE	3373	Nowadays , many countries are concerned with the environment problems . 	0
PE	3374	However , individuals are unable to cope with these things . 	0
PE	3375	Besides , the government and firms could have significant influences on environmental awareness of people . 	0
PE	3376	On one hand , solving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies , and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems . 	1
PE	3377	For example , air pollution and water quality has concerned many countries , and the government is able to implement some policies and invest money to reduce air pollution , while companies also can enhance their technologies to curb emission of contaminated water and substances . 	0
PE	3378	In conclusion , I believe demerits of watching TV outweigh its merits and thus if students were allowed to freely watch TV without any proper controls by parents or teachers then it would produce more negative effects on children . 	1
PE	3379	Sometimes , students watch restrictive programs not allowed for their ages and this can have major psychological consequences . 	0
PE	3380	Many times , students get addictive to their favorite programs like Cartoon channels , or baseball and easily get distracted from study during exam period and this can seriously impact their grades . 	0
PE	3381	This experience also makes them aware of what they would like to make of their life . 	0
PE	3382	The financial burden of families , for instance , has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money . 	0
PE	3383	In the second place , the revolution in females ' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well . 	1
PE	3384	This is to say , the " weaker " gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men , not to mention they even perform better in some fields . 	0
PE	3385	Women nowadays are much more active , they may be successful businessmen , they join the political world , they become scientists and so on . 	1
PE	3386	Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children . 	0
PE	3387	To start with , the fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society . 	0
PE	3388	This , contrary to some ideas , is a positive progress in human society from my point of view . 	1
PE	3389	Women have been opened up to more chances than ever . 	0
PE	3390	The modern times have witnessed profound changes in most aspects of life , including the revolution of feminism . 	0
PE	3391	Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past 	0
PE	3392	Another important thing to consider is that the teacher should be well-trained in the use of this specific language , so quality education will be delivered . 	0
PE	3393	Moreover , teachers think that foreign language most likely leads to confusion for children who are yet to start learning . 	0
PE	3394	I personally believe that it is important for children to be taught with a secondary language as early as kindergarten . 	1
PE	3395	This issue has garnered some attention in the academe as it has an impact on the children ' s learning . 	0
PE	3396	Learning at school must be convenient for them if they speak in a way that they are used to . 	0
PE	3397	To begin with , children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years . 	1
PE	3398	Educational institutions have different systems when it comes to introducing foreign languages to children . 	0
PE	3399	Foreign language instruction should begin in kindergarten 	0
PE	3400	However , those who disagree contend that this should be taught in later years . 	0
PE	3401	Some people believe that foreign language instruction should start in pre-school . 	0
PE	3402	In conclusion , people without talents cannot be famous in this changing world and to be accredited they need to contribute positively to young generation . 	1
PE	3403	Secondly , pets are useful for a variety of things . 	1
PE	3404	Since we are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day , many people often get lost . 	0
PE	3405	However , it takes time for people to adapt them . 	0
PE	3406	For example , we no longer have to travel to DMV to renew our driver ' s license or drive to bank for sending money . 	0
PE	3407	Students have become more and more stressed during the last few years due to the increase in academic tasks assigned by their teachers to improve their academic success . 	0
PE	3408	In addition , Learning a foreign language helps students tremendously to comprehend what happens in the around World . 	0
PE	3409	They would be able to understand other cultures and costumes . 	0
PE	3410	Moreover , It can give them a sense of power to communicate better with peers in other parts of the World . 	0
PE	3411	Having knowledge about other countries and their languages lead to extend the child ' s vision . 	0
PE	3412	Therefore , they would be able to develop their personalities and sense of reliance . 	1
PE	3413	Overall , it is easy to distinguish between a child having two languages and a child having just his native language while comparing their ability to communicate , understanding other studies , etc , to find that why children should start learning a foreign language in the beginning of the education . 	1
PE	3414	In conclusion , advertising is not the primary reason of unhealthy eating habits . 	1
PE	3415	There are the build-up of the concept about healthy eating habits and self-control that really matter . 	1
PE	3416	Technology designed to make people ' s lives simpler often make them more complicated 	0
PE	3417	People can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources , like news or magazines . 	0
PE	3418	As long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits , they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations . 	0
PE	3419	It will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast-food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors . 	0
PE	3420	Second , in the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle , some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods . 	0
PE	3421	In other words , advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people . 	1
PE	3422	Think about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added . 	0
PE	3423	These are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good . 	0
PE	3424	In these cases , the advertising industry bolsters people ' s awareness of having a healthy lifestyle . 	0
PE	3425	However , even with all the conveniences , we would have to admit that technologies made our lives more complicated . 	1
PE	3426	In addition , schools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people . 	0
PE	3427	Therefore , I never have been rich in my life , because my salary is not dramatically changed . 	1
PE	3428	In spite of many problems of having own business , I can earn more money based on my creativity and personal ideas . 	0
PE	3429	The amount of money is always the most important criterion for everyone to choose a job . 	0
PE	3430	To sum up , in spite of the fact that many people are not eager to work for themselves , I would like to run my own business to control my own time , and to earn more money based on my noble ideas . 	1
PE	3431	High-salary instructors don ' t teach students harder because they earn more money . 	0
PE	3432	This event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly . 	0
PE	3433	Concerning that elementary education , like the base of a architecture , is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today ' s society , government should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it . 	0
PE	3434	So a lack of well-established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy , and this interplay seriously compromises a country ' s future development . 	0
PE	3435	To improve education , spending more money to raise professors ' salary is inappropriate . 	1
PE	3436	In other words , if countries , especially the developing countries , are determined to take off , one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education . 	1
PE	3437	Besides , the ultimate purpose is to change , to motivate students to be better . 	0
PE	3438	Finally , quality takes time . 	0
PE	3439	Some professors don ' t deserve the money at all , then , what ' s the point to spend money on them ? 	0
PE	3440	If you do not hurry yourself you can take more time for your family and friends . 	0
PE	3441	In addition , will the university filter all the professors overall ? 	0
PE	3442	Caring for your social environment will increase your happiness and also reduce your stress level . 	0
PE	3443	Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both . 	0
PE	3444	Universities giving both genders equal opportunities , will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run . 	1
PE	3445	For example , students studying in boy ' s colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them . 	0
PE	3446	On the other hand , females studying in girl ' s colleges are too shy to face boys . 	0
PE	3447	Women like Margaret Thatcher , Indira Gandhi , Mari Curie etc . , are symbols of women ' s intelligence and skills . 	0
PE	3448	It is no wonder that governments throughout the world lay special emphasis on education development . 	0
PE	3449	Unfortunately , some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields , like maths , mechanical engineering , defense etc . This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society . 	1
PE	3450	Time and again , women have proved their mettle in every field . 	0
PE	3451	Equality in education will help in development of the society . 	1
PE	3452	If you are always facing excessive stress you cannot care for your beloved ' s . 	0
PE	3453	The zoo deserves maintenance and public respect 	0
PE	3454	Secondly , the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection . 	1
PE	3455	Nowadays the process of globalisation is accompanied by the encroachment upon natural habitats , which consequently calls for the help of zoos . 	0
PE	3456	By listening to your family and friends advice , you can definitely avoid many unexpected things . 	0
PE	3457	On the other hand , finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature . 	1
PE	3458	Therefore , learning about life , which is useful for foreseeing problems and be assertive enough to overcome them are needed . 	0
PE	3459	Two main ways of learning about life are listening to the advice of family and friends and learning through personal experience . 	0
PE	3460	The best way of learning life 	0
PE	3461	Life is full of challenges , difficulties and unexpected obstacles . 	0
PE	3462	Family members such as your parents are experienced in life so they can give you proper and sincere guidance on every aspect of life . 	0
PE	3463	And friends , people who are the same generation with you , they are understand your favorite and ability enough to tell you which is suitable for you , which is not . 	0
PE	3464	Both ways are good to follow because they all have their own distinct advantages . 	0
PE	3465	On one hand , the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter . 	1
PE	3466	Universities are relatively fenced environment . 	0
PE	3467	First of all , doing research is a method of self-improvement for professors . 	0
PE	3468	In addition , by doing research , professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies . 	0
PE	3469	The research projects provide communication with the outside . 	0
PE	3470	These days , more and more university professors are involved in scientific research . 	0
PE	3471	Professors should do more research or teach students ? 	0
PE	3472	However , according to my experiences , professors should be encouraged to mainly do research . 	1
PE	3473	Some are afraid that this will lead to the decline of education quality and suggest them to spend more time on teaching . 	0
PE	3474	He was often invited to do speech in other universities . 	0
PE	3475	I still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college . 	0
PE	3476	All things considered , in a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles . 	1
PE	3477	Yet everything has it upside and downside , women should find the best way to overcome such challenges . 	0
PE	3478	Also , children might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work . 	0
PE	3479	Admittedly , such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate or , under many circumstances , women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives . 	1
PE	3480	What is more , women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration . 	0
PE	3481	By way of conclusion , I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work ; on the contrary , they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas – this world needs them to make itself colourful . 	1
PE	3482	Cars use oil and gasoline and send out gas such as carbon dioxide , heat and so on . 	0
PE	3483	The use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution . 	1
PE	3484	The development of public transportation is the most essential thing for a developed society . 	1
PE	3485	Public transportation keeps society from the depletion of natural resources 	0
PE	3486	So , I think the government have to spend more money on improving it . 	0
PE	3487	Public transportation keeps society from the depletion of natural resources , the air pollution , the loss of a sense of community . 	1
PE	3488	Cars depend on oil and gasoline to move . 	0
PE	3489	The use of public transportation is the best way to conserve natural resources gradually run out . 	1
PE	3490	Instead of using many private cars , people can use public transportation , such as bus , train , subway , each one can get far more people and less oil and gasoline are used up per person . 	0
PE	3491	If people use too many private cars , the oil and gasoline nonrenewable will run out quickly . 	0
PE	3492	Admittedly , applying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers ' economic profit . 	0
PE	3493	While some appear to believe that advanced plant foods incorporate with newly developed devices significantly reduce the cost of producing farm products , others argue that this collaboration exerts a series of negative effects to people ' s health condition and the society . 	0
PE	3494	In recent years , the discussion about the agriculture development has become a controversy . 	0
PE	3495	Advanced fertilizers and machine for farmers , good or bad ? 	0
PE	3496	Unlike the organic plant foods , industrialized fertilizers are made of unusual chemicals , which are not only varying the gene of crops into those unknown substances but also remaining inside of plants permanently . 	0
PE	3497	However , high-tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals ' health well-being . 	1
PE	3498	Consequently , the production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased . 	1
PE	3499	This is because artificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops , and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest . 	0
PE	3500	Moreover , excessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society . 	1
PE	3501	In this case , consumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future . 	0
PE	3502	Because of the similarity I talked before , acquaintances probably not able to understand you better than your friends . 	0
PE	3503	Second , close friends can easily understand each others feelings . 	1
PE	3504	Everyone play the role of acquaintance and friend at the same time . 	0
PE	3505	Moreover , they wouldn ' t even spare time to consider your feelings . 	0
PE	3506	When my friend is sick , I would not only ask if he is okay like an acquaintance but do my best to make him get well as soon as possible . 	0
PE	3507	Being friendly is a good way to treat a acquaintance but way not enough for a friend . 	0
PE	3508	Having job would affect their health , divert them from studies and take away one of the important phase from their life . 	1
PE	3509	Thus , for a teenager it is important to pay attention on their studies . 	1
PE	3510	Therefore , they should take advantage of life as much possible they can . 	1
PE	3511	If my friend is going to the wrong direction in his life trail , I will try my best to pull him back , but not stand and stare like it ' s not of my business . 	0
PE	3512	To me , friends are the most important people in my life second to my family . 	1
PE	3513	In conclusion , a friend is a person you care about . 	1
PE	3514	This means , there will be children , grandparents , as well as pregnant women inside the restaurants . 	0
PE	3515	Secondly , restaurants are places that people usually come with their families . 	0
PE	3516	They will not be able to enjoy their meals while breathing in smoke around them . 	0
PE	3517	Smoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals . 	1
PE	3518	First of all , restaurants are places where people come and pay some money to enjoy their meals . 	0
PE	3519	In my opinion , smoking should not be permitted , especially in public places like restaurants because it will make the non-smokers breathe uncomfortably . 	1
PE	3520	Although many smokers claim that they need to smoke in order to work more effectively or to think more creatively , those reasons never proves that smoking has any benefits for human ' s body . 	0
PE	3521	There are so many researches done to prove that a cigar contains harmful ingredients for human ' s body . 	0
PE	3522	Generally speaking , smoking is never been good for human ' s body . 	0
PE	3523	Smoking should not be permitted in restaurants 	0
PE	3524	And if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics , I could not pass the entire part of physics , and I will fail the exam over and over again . 	0
PE	3525	But I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics . 	0
PE	3526	And I can study physics without consideration of my electronics . 	0
PE	3527	Luckily , in our university , you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach . 	0
PE	3528	Secondly , if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam , students are highly likely to leave uncultivated . 	1
PE	3529	And at last , I took the electronics again and pass the exam . 	0
PE	3530	And the students will have nothing to do in the campus . 	0
PE	3531	If one fail most of the exam , it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes . 	0
PE	3532	The academic achievement will decline . 	0
PE	3533	Then he or she will play online games days and nights . 	0
PE	3534	Last but not least , language is one of the essential factors creating the differences and unique cutures in the world . 	0
PE	3535	In addition , forming a language must be undergone thousands of years ; thus , it deserves to be respected and preserved . 	0
PE	3536	For instance , I have a neighbor who are old , black skin and frown and I had always panicked of her . 	0
PE	3537	Second of all , there are some people who are black skin , fat and frown , nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague . 	1
PE	3538	We can never judge about a person with his or her appearance . 	1
PE	3539	From my point of view although appearance is important , personality is the most important . 	1
PE	3540	Individuals have two features , one of them is appearance and the other one is personality . 	0
PE	3541	Best way to judge about people is to be familiar with their personality - not with their look 	0
PE	3542	For example , some people cheat their fiance before marriage by showing a cheerful face and well spoken ; however , after getting marriage they show their real personality . 	0
PE	3543	First of all , there are people who play a role and cheat the other individuals with their playing , therefore we have to be aware to never judge with their appearance . 	1
PE	3544	I completely disagree with these kind of judgement which someone makes . 	0
PE	3545	Some people believes , individuals who have black skin or are frown are not good person and in opposite individuals who have pale or white skin or always have smile on their face are good person . 	0
PE	3546	Thus , capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals . 	1
PE	3547	Moreover , capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes . 	0
PE	3548	Its first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings . 	0
PE	3549	When a criminal becomes a threat to the society , such that they can commit heinous crimes , then they are given capital punishment . 	0
PE	3550	However , strict laws , like capital punishment , are essential in a society . 	1
PE	3551	Capital punishment is given only in the " rarest of the rare " cases . 	0
PE	3552	Retribution is the method for countering criminals . 	0
PE	3553	Some countries have stringent rules , like capital punishment , while other have a lot of flexibility in the judicial system . 	0
PE	3554	Capital punishment - necessary or not 	0
PE	3555	Crime is always punishable . 	0
PE	3556	I , in my childhood , was just a typical case . 	0
PE	3557	Watching TV for a long time without doing homework is one of major headaches that most of children have brought to their parents . 	1
PE	3558	First of all , children generally have weak self-control , and thus they lose their time easily . 	0
PE	3559	As far as I am concerned , I agree with that children should be forbidden in watching television or movies excessively . 	1
PE	3560	Children , who are addicted to TV , causes broad argument about whether they should be limited in watching television in amount of time . 	0
PE	3561	For its accessible and containing fancy programs , television attracts audiences from a wide range of age and background . 	0
PE	3562	In 19th century , television is one of an significant inventions and has become a indispensible appliance in every house . 	0
PE	3563	Should parents limit their children watching TV to make them do well in school ? 	0
PE	3564	Moreover , if we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem , it is neither unethical nor immoral . 	0
PE	3565	If you kill a criminal , you become a criminal . 	0
PE	3566	Finally , with some of serious criminals , capital punishment is an easy way out . 	1
PE	3567	In short , crimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment . 	0
PE	3568	Secondly , nobody has the right to take another human life . 	1
PE	3569	Hence , death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture . 	1
PE	3570	I could watch TV for hours , but I could hardly sit in front of my desk to do homework for few minutes . 	0
PE	3571	Whenever I back to home from school , the first thing I would do is turning on the television and sit there for hours . 	0
PE	3572	By casting famous singers in their television advertisement , motorcycles or clothes for example , sales increase significantly since youngsters , as the target consumers , love celebrities . 	0
PE	3573	High sales reflect power of advertising and not the real need 	0
PE	3574	Nowadays , we can see advertisements everywhere , from television set to posters on the streets . 	0
PE	3575	Some people say that advertising must be blamed for the unhealthy eating habits , while others believe that there are still some other factors directing people ' s judgments . 	0
PE	3576	I tend to agree with this view . 	0
PE	3577	However , a meal which is nutritionally balanced is always most recommended . 	0
PE	3578	To sum up , it is evident for me that people choose to become vegetarians for health and religious concern rather than the benefits of animals . 	1
PE	3579	However , I am convinced that it is vital to follow one ' s own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind . 	1
PE	3580	It is often said that this view is rather unscientific . 	0
PE	3581	Some religion , such as Buddha , believes that animals were human being in their previous life , so eating their meat mean you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings . 	0
PE	3582	Secondy , relegious beliefs also contributes to a vegetarian diet . 	0
PE	3583	But these young people do not take into account that their lives are going to be more difficult , when they are away from home . 	1
PE	3584	They will have to pay a lot of bills , because they will have to find a lodging or at least a place where to live and in order to have less expenses they will have to find a co-tenant , who they may not like . 	0
PE	3585	Some young adults want independence from their parents quickly 	0
PE	3586	Many young adults want to get away from their parent ' s houses as soon as possible in order to have no limits , to be independent . 	0
PE	3587	If the young adults still study they will have to combine studying with working , because they will not have money to pay for everything . 	0
PE	3588	There will not be such worries when young adults live in their own home , because parents will take care for them . 	0
PE	3589	Living in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money . 	1
PE	3590	If they live separate from their parents they will have to pay for a loan , electricity , water or even for a meal . 	0
PE	3591	Moreover , parents will give their children money in order they to focus only on studying . 	0
PE	3592	Another problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co-tenant , who they do not like . 	1
PE	3593	After all , retirement not only marks the end of an individual , but also gives him a chance to make up for what he has lost throughout his working life . 	0
PE	3594	From social perspective , massively forcing the early retirement would be one of financial burden to the local government . 	0
PE	3595	It is undeniable that every person within the business enterprise has the rights to proceed their work as long as they are capable of doing it , disregard the age and physical capacity . 	0
PE	3596	In conclusion , even though the introduction of the early retirement has some benefits , it is convincing that it would generate a sense of discrimination among different age groups and increase the government financial pressure accordingly . 	1
PE	3597	For example , sufficient pension payments and regular medical care should be given and arranged for the senior citizens after they have been imposed to terminate their employment permanently . 	0
PE	3598	It is not to say , of course , that other points of view are completely without merit . 	0
PE	3599	I firmly believe that psychopaths , terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment . 	1
PE	3600	Capital punishment is essential to control violence in the society . 	1
PE	3601	However , it should be considered as the last option by the jury and all circumstances must be taken into account before pronouncing the final verdict . 	0
PE	3602	Capital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner . 	1
PE	3603	However , still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum , instead , they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done . 	0
PE	3604	Besides , most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs . 	0
PE	3605	Those who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness . 	1
PE	3606	This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects . 	0
PE	3607	However , the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected . 	0
PE	3608	Most importantly , under such target-oriented education environment , teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study . 	0
PE	3609	Moreover , the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study . 	0
PE	3610	It is undeniable that concentrating on one subject can reduce students ' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents , while its shortfalls are so vital to students ' future . 	1
PE	3611	Therefore , I do support the view of learning all school subjects . 	1
PE	3612	Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour . 	0
PE	3613	Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains . 	0
PE	3614	For example , I have started to read a novel since last week . 	0
PE	3615	I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day , so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class . 	0
PE	3616	In contrast , I cannot watch a complete movie because I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that , I have to study . 	0
PE	3617	Some people might argue that people enjoy watching TV when they know they can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies . 	1
PE	3618	This point has some merits on the surface ; however , movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners since characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners . 	0
PE	3619	For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable . 	0
PE	3620	To sum up , reading fictions is more pleasant because these books have more depth , are much easier to use , and more useful for language learners . 	1
PE	3621	Compared to other hobbies such as going to theater or going to sports stadium , it is a very cost-effective hobby that gives viewer quiet a few indirect experiences . 	0
PE	3622	However , from my point of view , television has more bad than good because it has made people not to have conversation each other . 	1
PE	3623	Television has more bad than good in respect of bonds with family and friends 	0
PE	3624	There are many interesting programs on television which anyone can enjoy at little cost . 	0
PE	3625	Thus , they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time since they think the programs are so crucial to their lives . 	0
PE	3626	One of my friends , for example , once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show " Infinete Challenges " . 	0
PE	3627	To begin with , television shows make people forget what is really important . 	1
PE	3628	One who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air . 	0
PE	3629	This is not only about basketball , but also about our friendship , which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other . 	0
PE	3630	That is , watching television alone at home , my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us . 	0
PE	3631	Not only teachers could amplify their performance but the whole education system are also improve performance from evaluation made by students . 	0
PE	3632	Thereby , evaluating from students is one of the ways to improve quality of educational system . 	0
PE	3633	Getting opinions from many sources could augment people ' s performance . 	0
PE	3634	Getting opinions from many sources could augment people ' s performance . 	0
PE	3635	Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information . 	0
PE	3636	For example , evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product . 	0
PE	3637	To begin with , Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers ' performance . 	0
PE	3638	Therefore , I agree with this notion that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers . 	1
PE	3639	Therefore , evaluating from students could improve teachers ' performance . 	1
PE	3640	Consequently , teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give . 	0
PE	3641	Furthermore , thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products . 	1
PE	3642	Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights . 	0
PE	3643	For instance , cows are often injected by Oxytocin , a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation . 	0
PE	3644	This in turn , causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle . 	0
PE	3645	From my prospective , human being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters . 	1
PE	3646	Animal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior and manipulation of them should be punished as a serious crime . 	1
PE	3647	Many other practices like , equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster . 	0
PE	3648	And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals . 	0
PE	3649	Learner could learn how to use tools and see actual organs of fog . 	0
PE	3650	For example , in biology class , learning anatomy by operating fog have many benefits . 	0
PE	3651	Hence I strongly believe in hard working that would not easily disappoint you as luck sometimes does . 	1
PE	3652	In conclusion , I certainly can say that growing of violence in films have definitely negative effects on youngsters mostly on their study , emotions and behaviors . 	1
PE	3653	He realized that having a master ' s degree would be a great credential for him to outperform his competitors . 	0
PE	3654	Although he had many commitments at home and work , he somehow managed to complete this degree before he was eligible to apply . 	0
PE	3655	At the end he was not only able to get the promotion amidst a stiff competition but also got nominated for a foreign scholarship since he had more credentials than other officers in his capacity . 	0
PE	3656	Although it is good to be lucky , depending on luck for everything is not good . 	1
PE	3657	Therefore , if these scenes are in TV , they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child . 	1
PE	3658	For instance , dying is always a disappointing happening . 	0
PE	3659	Furthermore , killing is worse . 	0
PE	3660	In this condition , because he is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it , it is obvious that he wouldn ’ t be able to concentrate on his study perfectly . 	0
PE	3661	Hence , the study of a youngster would affected terribly . 	1
PE	3662	For example , a child watches a frightening movie . 	0
PE	3663	There are many advantages of distance learning , but it should not replace classroom learning . 	1
PE	3664	I think limiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice since it will reward the motivation of students and constantly keep them in the difficult level of learning , which makes them do the best to improve themselves . 	0
PE	3665	As the world ' s situation is always changing , act for distributing education needs are absolutely important to compete the future challenges . 	1
PE	3666	No matter how advanced technology will be , it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils . 	0
PE	3667	As a recent interview with Josh Trumm – the founder of the ' Teachers Global Group ' - reveals , human interactions will never be imitated by computers : ' This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper education . 	0
PE	3668	Without someone who can explain and understand their problems , pupils cannot actually learn ' . 	0
PE	3669	I am inclined to agree with this scientific view , because only a teacher can feel and connect with pupils , be a friend and a model . 	0
PE	3670	In conclusion , there can be no school without a teacher . 	1
PE	3671	I think that computers will continue to be used by teachers in the learning process , but they will never take their place . 	1
PE	3672	Teachers are not just teachers , they are also friends and conseilieurs . 	1
PE	3673	Living with a roommate made socializing much easier for me . 	0
PE	3674	Finally , living with a roommate allows me to get help . 	1
PE	3675	Even though his friends and I were total strangers to each other , we quickly got to know each other . 	0
PE	3676	We soon found out that everyone loved playing video games . 	0
PE	3677	We played a video game called ' Halo ' together all night , and became good friends . 	0
PE	3678	I was able to save a lot of money by sharing wasted heating and rooms with my friend and splitting the bills . 	0
PE	3679	Apart from saving a lot of money , living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily . 	1
PE	3680	It is always easier to socialize when you have a lot of people around you . 	0
PE	3681	You can invite your roommates ' friends over to your room and have fun together . 	0
PE	3682	To give an example , I used to be good at math when I was in junior high school . 	0
PE	3683	Both local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services , and more employment opportunities can be created as well . 	0
PE	3684	I also believe the revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment . 	0
PE	3685	Furthermore , the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well . 	1
PE	3686	The provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably . 	0
PE	3687	With adequate local facilities and services available , they can spend more of their holidays having fun and relaxing . 	0
PE	3688	In addition , both locals and tourists can experience more cultures than ever before , and they can be more open-minded to eliminate preconceptions and deepen mutual understanding among nations . 	0
PE	3689	In conclusion , the prosperity of tourism can provide benefits for people on a global scale . 	1
PE	3690	Although there are some inevitable problems , they are outweighed by advantages and can be tackled if proper measures are taken . 	1
PE	3691	Instead of waiting for next publication , people can get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two . 	0
PE	3692	This explains why digital media will rule over paper and magazines . 	1
PE	3693	The friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth . 	0
PE	3694	In such situations , newspapers and magazines can not respond as fast as digital media . 	0
PE	3695	But internet provides efficient search facility where one can search the topic and get the details . 	0
PE	3696	This feature of digital media is not supported by newspapers and magazines . 	0
PE	3697	People often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research , satisfy interest , etc . For example , one research fellow may want to know how a small village named Oramaki in Japan was suffering after Second World War . 	1
PE	3698	It is very difficult to get this sort of information from past in newspapers and magazines as one has to know before where to look at . 	0
PE	3699	To conclude , the fast responding internet media with vast information will be replacing newspapers and magazines as new and information provider for valid reasons . 	1
PE	3700	Though considering the current infrastructure and mindset of people , paper media will continue for another few years . 	1
PE	3701	Wherever possible , exams should match the content and activities of the learning environment . 	0
PE	3702	Exam task should be varied to give fair opportunities to candidates with different types of skills . 	0
PE	3703	In this case , teachers and learners focus only on theses aspects of the curriculum that are likely to be tested , thus narrowing the educational experience for all . 	0
PE	3704	A number of measures should be taken to address these concerns . 	1
PE	3705	However , exams need to be carefully designed and supplemented with other forms of evaluation if they are to be a truly useful component of the education system . 	1
PE	3706	Other types of assessment should also be considered , assignment writing , for example , to assess independent learning and research skills , or group projects , to measure teamwork ability . 	0
PE	3707	In conclusion , it is convincing that exams have a role to play in ensuring proper and objective assessment of achievement . 	1
PE	3708	However , it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention . 	0
PE	3709	Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced . 	0
PE	3710	In conclusion , both of the arguments have strong supports , but in my own view , more good come from zoos than bad . 	1
PE	3711	Also , zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life . 	0
PE	3712	This is due to the fact that , in zoos , animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters . 	0
PE	3713	Many people , especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals , cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world . 	0
PE	3714	Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public . 	0
PE	3715	Furthermore , stress takes a toll on our health . 	0
PE	3716	Therefore , stress management recently becomes a more significant issue in our realization . 	1
PE	3717	This is one of the reasons why people were overwhelmed by constant stress . 	0
PE	3718	It is known that the modern life is frequently full of hassles , frustrations , and demands . 	0
PE	3719	Melancholia , the most fatal problem , even leads some people to commit suicide . 	0
PE	3720	Thus , some people have physical problems , such as insomnia and headaches . 	0
PE	3721	From this , it ' s clear that computer has a positive effect on the children . 	1
PE	3722	Following the demonstration of a computer ' s contribution in children ' s study and building skills which are to be used in their career afterwards , it is agreed that computer is a boon to children . 	1
PE	3723	For the above reasons , I believe that stress management is an essential skill for everyone to learn and find their own way to solve their stress . 	1
PE	3724	Firstly , a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses , this is generally known as spam , and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people . 	1
PE	3725	Secondly , advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results . 	0
PE	3726	Therefore , advertising is believed by many , a financial burden to businesses . 	1
PE	3727	In conclusion , after analyzing the pros and cons of advertising , both of the views have strong support , but it is felt that more good comes from advertising than bad . 	1
PE	3728	Thus , the idea that advertising is a positive part of life can be more supported . 	1
PE	3729	However , the warmth of the materials , the heart pine , marble , or the old brick , all those old buildings features call back of our inner peace . 	0
PE	3730	The city is occupied with an abundance of modern houses and and high buildings which make it crowded , and no rooms for people to relax themselves . 	0
PE	3731	However , the preservation of old buildings is a one-way street . 	0
PE	3732	Overall , I believe that the city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity . 	1
PE	3733	In fact , those good endings sometimes are helpful . 	0
PE	3734	So we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding . 	0
PE	3735	But like I said , this kind of behavior won ’ t last long , because someday they will realize the truth . 	0
PE	3736	Some people may be encouraged to do good things . 	0
PE	3737	And if they can , they will be good people no matter how the story ends . 	0
PE	3738	So I suggest we should show people the truth in the stories . 	1
PE	3739	Based on my arguments above , I think movies and TV programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing . 	1
PE	3740	Sometimes , they want an information that can help them in daily life which the internet can provide all of these to people . 	0
PE	3741	For example , a businessman who has no time to watch a television or read a newspaper can receive news and check stock markets easily via the internet . 	0
PE	3742	In my opinion , I agree with the latter because the internet gives daily necessary information , people can gain knowledge and they can explore the world . 	1
PE	3743	First of all , everybody would like to know what is going on around the world in their everyday lives . 	1
PE	3744	Some people believe that several problems occur from an information on the internet . 	0
PE	3745	However , some say that the internet provides a lot of valuable information . 	1
PE	3746	The internet provides a lot of valuable information 	0
PE	3747	In the modern society , internet is considered as one of the most important inventions over the past century . 	0
PE	3748	They cheat young ages because they believe they are immature and they can trap them easily . 	0
PE	3749	To sum up , it makes no difference , people from young ages to old ages are free to make a decision , nonetheless sometimes to prevent some problems coming up for young individuals , it is a good idea to ask parents and adult relatives to give a piece of advice . 	1
PE	3750	Throughout human history , the offspring has always proved its stronger adaptability and advancement than its predecessor . 	0
PE	3751	In addition , people can gain more knowledge by using the internet , the most useful technology in the world . 	1
PE	3752	Many people such as students can take online courses to study at home or they can watch beneficial videos which also teach them knowledge . 	0
PE	3753	Old and young workers 	0
PE	3754	There is no doubt that money has become key ingredient in various walks of our life than before . 	0
PE	3755	Higher school students should be taught how to manage money 	0
PE	3756	We are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place . 	0
PE	3757	To put it in a nutshell , I pen down saying that , technology alone can solve the world ' s environmental problems . 	1
PE	3758	Some people feel that teaching money management skill to teenage students will help them realise the importance of money , while few feel that exposing children to money math at this age may turn fatal . 	0
PE	3759	One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa . 	0
PE	3760	There are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot . 	1
PE	3761	Furthermore , Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030 . 	0
PE	3762	Teaching financial management to juvenile students is always a topic of debate . 	0
PE	3763	If successful , the impact on the world would be monumental . 	0
PE	3764	By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun , it could meet the entire world ' s electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions . 	0
PE	3765	It would mean another industrial revolution . 	0
PE	3766	It would mean energy for schools , hospitals , and homes . 	0
PE	3767	What is more , it is acknowledged that a large number of creational facilities are built in cities . 	0
PE	3768	Children who live in cities have a lot of entertainment . 	1
PE	3769	For instance , in my country the best schools , universities and institutes are located in cities , and todays education is one of the most important parts of our children ' s life . 	0
PE	3770	Therefore , it is a good idea for children to past their first earlier life in the cities . 	1
PE	3771	From my point of view big cities can be a good place for bringing up children . 	1
PE	3772	To begin with , it is undeniable that education is better in big cities in comparison with countrysides . 	0
PE	3773	It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city ? 	0
PE	3774	Nowadays living is possible on every place of the world , but still there are some differences among them . 	0
PE	3775	For example playgrounds , parks , science museums , cinemas etc . However , in countrysides we hardly ever see creational facilities . 	0
PE	3776	Children who live in countrysides most of the time pass their free time in farms . 	0
PE	3777	As the Australia ’ s Great Barrier Reef has shown , the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder , namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat ’ s anchors , dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions . 	0
PE	3778	For this reason , many marine lives have been endangered , in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species . 	0
PE	3779	International tourism is now more common than ever before 	0
PE	3780	The last 50 years have seen a significant increase in the number of tourist traveling worldwide . 	0
PE	3781	While some might think the tourism bring large profit for the destination countries , I would contend that this industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations . 	1
PE	3782	Firstly , it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations . 	0
PE	3783	Take Thailand for example , in the Vietnam War , many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities , these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded , even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximize their profits . 	0
PE	3784	This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism . 	0
PE	3785	Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries . 	1
PE	3786	Secondly , there are clear evidences that tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals . 	0
PE	3787	This plan ability helps me a lot , making me climb to the top rank of the class while finishing everything else . 	0
PE	3788	Yet , in this year , following the suggestion of my roommate , John , I make a to-do list to plan and organize perfectly everything I should get done in the final and hence take every tasks and trivials into control . 	0
PE	3789	Take myself as an example , I used to be overwhelmed by the burden of preparing for the final exam , submitting my paper , and finishing my internship work at the end of each term . 	0
PE	3790	First of all , great planning and organizing ability is able to cause our actions more efficient and productive . 	1
PE	3791	Meanwhile , eliminating meaningless actions . 	0
PE	3792	Therefore , it is essential for people , especially young ones , to possess the ability to plan and organize since it can improve the efficiency and reduce the crisis of our actions . 	1
PE	3793	With the fast rolling wheels of modern society , life becomes more complex and is not easy to handle than in the past . 	0
PE	3794	It is essential to have ability to plan and organize 	0
PE	3795	As we all know , the employees in every company have to create profit as much as they can for their supervisors and complete their assignments perfectly . 	0
PE	3796	Equally important , the capacity to plan and organize also help young people to eliminate the crisis in their actions , which may ruin one ' s whole effort over a very long time . 	1
PE	3797	Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts : where more and more is known about less and less . 	0
PE	3798	Nevertheless , among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life . 	0
PE	3799	True function of a university 	0
PE	3800	Universities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise . 	0
PE	3801	What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for , not the employers , as students are the ones here to seek knowledge . 	0
PE	3802	High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons : a degree that ' s more widely accepted , gain knowledge and insight into an industry , or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field . 	0
PE	3803	However , although I respect the universities ' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause , I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university . 	0
PE	3804	A university , in common sense , is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge . 	1
PE	3805	On the other hand , universities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather . 	0
PE	3806	It is , therefore , not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university , but instead , these must be made available when needed . 	0
PE	3807	To sum up , this new construction has a lot of advantages like new connections between students from different communities , also the new educational equipment will increase the students ' enthusiasm toward studying . 	1
PE	3808	The people living in the neighborhood will be a bit perturbed , but I think this isn ' t a important reason for ceasing the competitions . 	0
PE	3809	So the new high school will be a great addition for my environment . 	1
PE	3810	The only disadvantage is the nosiness of competitions which students will participate , but I think that it isn ' t a big deal . 	1
PE	3811	For instance during the football match the students of different high schools will come and after the competition they will keep in touch . 	0
PE	3812	After classes students and not only the students will get together in building of high school , participate in different competitions . 	0
PE	3813	The only disadvantage is the noisiness of the competitions . 	0
PE	3814	This will increase the social connections of the students . 	0
PE	3815	Because their major in completely involved in physical activities . 	0
PE	3816	In contrast , for an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories , because it really make the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe find new things in their field . 	0
PE	3817	In addition , students choose their major based on their interests . 	0
PE	3818	The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students . 	1
PE	3819	For example when I and my friends want to spend time with each other , we prefer to go out of university to the places where we do not want to be disturbed by any familiar people . 	0
PE	3820	In conclusion , I do not deny the importance of doing sports in the success of university students , but I think both sports and social activities should not receive equal amount of money with libraries and laboratories . 	1
PE	3821	Finally , spending money on social activities looks like wasting money . 	1
PE	3822	For students who want to gather with their friends or want to go out to meet new people , university programs are the last place they would choose . 	0
PE	3823	Although some argue that a meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake , it is proved that many kinds of bean such as soy bean or pea are also comparable protein sources . 	0
PE	3824	This fortifies the fact that a vegetable diet can do good for our health . 	0
PE	3825	Many researchers have convinced that many kinds of vegetable contain antioxydant which can prevent cancer . 	0
PE	3826	Firstly , health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular . 	1
PE	3827	It is clear to me that people avoid eating meat mostly for the sake of their health and relegious aspect . 	1
PE	3828	Some people claim that this is brought about by the care for animal rights issue , others think it is much beyond that . 	0
PE	3829	Recent years , however , has seen a rapid increase in the number of vegetarians . 	0
PE	3830	Meat has served as the main dish in almost every family ' s meals all around the world . 	0
PE	3831	Since the dawn of time , human has considered meat as a fundamental protein sources . 	0
PE	3832	Vegetarianism - why some people are choosing to become vegetarian ? 	0
PE	3833	By way of conclusion , it is my belief that wild animals should be set free from zoos not only because they have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression . 	1
PE	3834	It seems that the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide . 	0
PE	3835	However , I would contend that the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat . 	0
PE	3836	They further point out that the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting . 	0
PE	3837	For instance , housework is very difficult for me , although my husband helps me some of them , but it is my responsibility . 	0
PE	3838	I really don ' t like any of them , however I should do . 	0
PE	3839	This is basic part of the lives . 	0
PE	3840	There may be small or big things , but at last people should accept them , because most of them is about responsibilities . 	0
PE	3841	In personal live , we have some responsibilities towards other people 	0
PE	3842	People should sometimes do things , even though they don ' t enjoy it . 	0
PE	3843	Firstly , most people ' s lives are filled with tasks that they don ' t enjoy doing . 	0
PE	3844	In personal live , we have some responsibilities towards to other people , there is nobody who likes all of these responsibilities . 	1
PE	3845	Moreover , sometimes by doing things helps the people learn about live . 	0
PE	3846	In this essay , the reasons for why I agree that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing will be explored . 	1
PE	3847	Furthermore , it can be replaced by a life sentence . 	1
PE	3848	In conclusion , although capital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community , I firmly object to it because it is absurd and inhumane . 	1
PE	3849	Thus , many people are executed for the crime they did not commit , which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system . 	0
PE	3850	Juries are also humans , they may lack of discretion . 	0
PE	3851	I wish one day this problem would be changed . 	0
PE	3852	To sum up , the transportation is an elementary factor which directly affects to people ’ s living . 	1
PE	3853	And then , the transportation in my hometown is no longer difficult for everyone in this community . 	0
PE	3854	Also , it provides many advantages . 	0
PE	3855	Lastly , having more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars . 	0
PE	3856	The necessary energy will slowly be used up , since people use less their own cars . 	1
PE	3857	For instance , people can save their expenses form gasoline , which nowadays is getting more expensive . 	0
PE	3858	Therefore , a government ' s role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people ' s lives . 	0
PE	3859	That ’ s why it is important to take risks . 	1
PE	3860	In sum , I believe that success and trying new things and taking risks go hand in hand and to achieve success you should consider them . 	1
PE	3861	The more you take risks , the greater your successes will be . 	0
PE	3862	If you don ’ t take any risks , you will have an ordinary life with average successes . 	0
PE	3863	If you want to gain very high profits in investments , you should use great and very high amounts of money in very risky financial decisions and dealings in which you may lose much amount of money . 	0
PE	3864	If you want to achieve a remarkable success in an important exam , you should risk studying all the time and sacrificing your free time and your favorite hobbies . 	0
PE	3865	Both these factors have their own values , and have been discussed in detail below : Competitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently . 	1
PE	3866	Some people think that it is better to make them competitive , while other believes to make them co-operative . 	0
PE	3867	It is undeniable that children have an innocent mind , and they requires a proper guidance at a specific time to make them understand the value of life . 	0
PE	3868	People should create a sense of co-operation in their children 	0
PE	3869	However , those who wants to create a sense of co-operation in their children is a symbol that they want to make them sensible enough in their lives ahead . 	0
PE	3870	For example , MNCs are mainly focusing on a team work , and a person with the competitive mind would be having a difficulty in managing the situation with the team . 	0
PE	3871	This factor will lead them to be successful in their lives ahead , but will also restrict them in many ways . 	0
PE	3872	This factor initially arises from the school , where teacher encourages student to feel more competitive through the grading system , and this is the place where children are trying to get on the top by scoring the highest marks . 	0
PE	3873	As for students , we can get what we want to know from textbooks , webs or teachers . 	0
PE	3874	All of my classmates gave him a rank of AAA , the excellent teacher . 	0
PE	3875	Although professors in a university are basically teachers who do the most important thing , teaching , we cannot ignore one more influential aspect that they are always busy with , doing research . 	0
PE	3876	Should professors doing more research or educating students more ? 	0
PE	3877	A professor means a researcher or an expert of a specific science subject . 	0
PE	3878	In my opinion , a professor should spend more time doing research rather than educating students for a few reasons following . 	1
PE	3879	And then he or she can do better in teaching works . 	0
PE	3880	He or she should always keep the passion in her field so that he or she could push him / herself forward all the time . 	1
PE	3881	He is also the one who gave us inspiration and taught us the way to study more efficient by ourselves . 	0
PE	3882	For instance , the most impressive professor during my studying in university is Mr . Yang who keeps in researching and reading . 	0
PE	3883	I feel that after working out , I am easily to fall asleep . 	0
PE	3884	Exercising not only reduce my stress but also make me get a good health . 	0
PE	3885	These problem sometime make me hard to fall asleep because it make me stress . 	0
PE	3886	Thus , after work , I always do exercise , and jogging is my favorite sport . 	0
PE	3887	Second , another way that is perfectly work for everyone to reduce the stress is exercise . 	1
PE	3888	For instance , I alway have many things in my mind such as a difficult of my work that I have to finish in time . 	0
PE	3889	I could enjoy listening music without thinking of people around me . 	0
PE	3890	Consequently , I feel happy when I listen music . 	0
PE	3891	These make me stress . 	0
PE	3892	So that I always listen music from my mp3 player . 	0
PE	3893	If he lives with his parents for longer time , they have more chances to share the feelings , exercise , and travel together . 	0
PE	3894	All memories become priceless treasure as time passes by . 	0
PE	3895	Students can gain more knowledge in every different subjects thy study . 	0
PE	3896	For instance , university students who study business are also know history of the world . 	0
PE	3897	Furthermore , students not only gain knowledge but they also have more experience because they will meet new friends and teachers . 	0
PE	3898	Hence , they all can share opinion and knowledge to one another . 	0
PE	3899	Finally , students who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career . 	1
PE	3900	This is because graduates can work in various kind of works which they can select a job they prefer . 	0
PE	3901	For example , students will choose a career that they want including the job with high salary include . 	0
PE	3902	Moreover , bachelors can earn lots of money by working in other fields due to their knowledge . 	0
PE	3903	In concluding , learning several subjects in universities is better than specialize in one subject because it makes students have more chance to gain knowledge to use in their lives and opportunity to choose their own future . 	1
PE	3904	Unfortunately , many governments restrict the artists . 	0
PE	3905	I am the kind of person who has only one or two close friends , and I am fully content that I have such nice friends . 	0
PE	3906	The young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age . 	0
PE	3907	When having a job , it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown . 	0
PE	3908	I believe that with the help of our family , we can achieve success quite easily . 	1
PE	3909	In a word , our parents and other family members can help us a lot in our life . 	1
PE	3910	What they want is help their child to make a progress . 	0
PE	3911	Besides , parents can told their children as many as they can . 	0
PE	3912	Hence , people and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime ' s categories such as theft , robbery , murder , rape , vandalism , arson . 	0
PE	3913	Obviously , Those are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence . 	1
PE	3914	In conclusion , from the above views , although being armed with guns in the police force is necessary , it will bring the higher level of violence . 	1
PE	3915	Additionally , the government should to impose strict laws in carrying weapons as well as give professional training to them in order to avoid any influence on civilians ' lives . 	0
PE	3916	The reason why most people oppose to zoos is that in some of them the animals are not very well taken care of and they do not have good and clean facilities . 	1
PE	3917	This is mostly true but does not relate to the purpose of zoos . 	0
PE	3918	In the present there is a lack of respect for animals . 	0
PE	3919	Being able to see the animals in real life and learning facts about them would help by making people aware of the importance of animals and the respect they deserve . 	0
PE	3920	It would be great if every zoo kept the animals in perfect conditions , but regardless of the condition , zoos are very useful . 	1
PE	3921	I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions . 	1
PE	3922	This overwhelming crisis is prompting delayering and reduction of workers . 	0
PE	3923	As a result , people are focusing on doing several jobs or gaining further qualification to secure their economic condition . 	1
PE	3924	A full time job with a steady income was enough for a potential employee to support himself and his family . 	0
PE	3925	But with the recent recession , almost all the countries all over the world are seeing significant economic downfall . 	0
PE	3926	People usually tend to have a single career as a means of living . 	0
PE	3927	However , a modern trend reveals that new generations are more interested to perform several jobs and also would like to gain multiple higher educational certificates in order to earn more and to gain financial security . 	0
PE	3928	People are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification 	0
PE	3929	The career itself became the motto of living since the beginning of industrialization in the late 19th century . 	0
PE	3930	The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system . 	0
PE	3931	Moreover , the arrival of technology has also been playing a major role promoting further unemployment . 	0
PE	3932	The official term of it is named " Technological Unemployment " . 	0
PE	3933	Lastly , experiences are also change to plan for my future life . 	1
PE	3934	For example , I read about saving money for my retire is a good plan for my life . 	0
PE	3935	Secondly , Some experiences could teach me the way to take care of myself . 	1
PE	3936	For instance , reading and listening the news about choosing a good diet are the way to keep myself are more healthy . 	0
PE	3937	Which ways are shortest and which ways are less consume my time . 	0
PE	3938	I could find a better way to solve problems . 	0
PE	3939	So that , I can have a good health . 	0
PE	3940	This experience teach me to aware my health . 	0
PE	3941	Thus , I am always buy a quality food such as organic food . 	0
PE	3942	This food are not have chemical . 	0
PE	3943	In today ' s world , having and raising children can be a very difficult task for families , the smallest component of the society . 	0
PE	3944	Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded , they may feel upset and not to be a good person . 	0
PE	3945	But in fact , the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not . 	0
PE	3946	And I think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies . 	0
PE	3947	So if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded , they may think it will be true in the real world . 	1
PE	3948	They will be misleading by those movies . 	0
PE	3949	And they may act like good people in order to get reward . 	0
PE	3950	But now many people , including me , have been tired with it . 	0
PE	3951	I don ’ t want to see the same kind of ending again and again . 	0
PE	3952	So we can ’ t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs . 	1
PE	3953	Even in the real world , good people can get a bad ending sometimes . 	0
PE	3954	Even in some cases , people compose a message with only emoticons ( the expressions by face created by service providers ) , which means there is no room for writing or typing texts . 	0
PE	3955	Moreover , it is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying , writing assignments . 	0
PE	3956	If that tendency continues at a rapid pace , written language may face up to a real problem about its stand . 	0
PE	3957	In conclusion , we cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity . 	1
PE	3958	They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways . 	0
PE	3959	The popularity of email and text messaging , as a result , leads to the losing of written language ' s position . 	1
PE	3960	People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities . 	0
PE	3961	The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form . 	0
PE	3962	Nevertheless , educators and individuals themselves , especially the youths should pay ore attention to this matter so that we can take advantages of the new language along with preserving the traditional one . 	0
PE	3963	Earning money for living becomes more difficult , living healthy in such places is getting harder also . 	1
PE	3964	In conclusion , I believe that life in big cities can have negative effects on people ' s health . 	1
PE	3965	Furthermore , living in such cities also means living in high crime rate areas . 	1
PE	3966	Unemployed workers or school dropouts can easily commit crime from petty offence to felony such as burglary , pickpocketing , trickery , vandalism , smuggling or even murder . 	0
PE	3967	Thus , both government and individual should take steps to diminish the consequences involved . 	0
PE	3968	As mentioned in the second paragraph , how can a man live happily if he is unhealthy ? 	0
PE	3969	The first reason why the father ' s role should be equal to the mother ' s role is the nature of parantage . 	1
PE	3970	While mother ' s role is essential in a child ' s life , I completely agree with the idea that fatherhood is a as vital part of a healty parantage as much as motherhood . 	1
PE	3971	For example , in a traditional Turkish family , while a mother has a sincere and thoughtful approach to the child , a father role must be present as authoritarian and conversative to raise a well-behaved child . 	0
PE	3972	One of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation . 	0
PE	3973	As you can see , studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job . 	1
PE	3974	In school , we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them . 	0
PE	3975	This can be done in school . 	0
PE	3976	For example , if someone wants to become a good industrial engineer , he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job . 	0
PE	3977	If we study them hard , we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future . 	0
PE	3978	I think that No factor is important enough by itself to succeed in any situations . 	0
PE	3979	The ability to relate well to people is more important 	0
PE	3980	I believe that both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job for following reasons : We need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job . 	1
PE	3981	We should consider many factors and choose the best of them . 	0
PE	3982	In my view , the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child ' s characteristics . 	0
PE	3983	Moreover , advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers . 	1
PE	3984	Take Coca cola for an example , this drinking firm is well-known as one of companies invested a major part of their money in advertising . 	0
PE	3985	Discuss both harms and good of advertising and give your opinion 	0
PE	3986	On these days , with the assistance of advertisement , people easily purchase the best products with detailed information and instruction for their requirement . 	0
PE	3987	Although some people claim that the advantages of advertising are outweigh the advantages , I believe that advertisement bring more benefits than harms to our lives . 	1
PE	3988	On the one hand , it is clear that most advertisements so exaggerate the quality of their products that they often ignore some negative effects of what they sell . 	0
PE	3989	In addition to this , all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods . 	1
PE	3990	For example , some kinds of shampoo , namely Sunsilk , Clear , Dove are publicized as magic items to recreate injured hair with the number of other benefits . 	0
PE	3991	However , the fact is that not all customers are satisfied with what they bought under the introduction from advertisement . 	0
PE	3992	On the other hand , it is undeniable fact that advertising market gives lots of working opportunities from producers , writers to models and cameramen for all of people as long as their qualification adapt to the demands . 	1
PE	3993	In my opinion , we are living in a society that puts a significant importance to gender equality in every aspect of the life , including relationships . 	0
PE	3994	The second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today . 	1
PE	3995	I will give reasons to support my opinion . 	0
PE	3996	Instead , all of the couple duties are performed equally and interchangeably by individuals . 	0
PE	3997	And also dancing to entertain people . 	0
PE	3998	For example , some culture people believe that they dance in order to sacrifice to their god so they will be get a happy life . 	0
PE	3999	First , dancing are significant part of culture that could show to something that people believe . 	0
PE	4000	In every country , people do dance for fun , for entertrain , and for decrease a stress . 	0
PE	4001	Dancing plays an important role in a culture . 	0
PE	4002	For instance , a family formed by a woman with a housewife role who looks after the home and takes care of children and a man who brings money home can not be seen anymore in today ' s society . 	0
PE	4003	Computers have made human life more easy , convenient and lightning fast . 	0
PE	4004	They are used in space programs , wars , hospitals , schools and so on . 	0
PE	4005	Right from flying planes to sending a small document , computers are needed . 	0
PE	4006	The whole world is dependent on computers , without which , the world will go back hundreds of years . 	1
PE	4007	Computers - use , future prospects and over-dependence 	0
PE	4008	It is sure that advertising always makes the products so tempting , regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body . 	0
PE	4009	However , advertising is not the only information source for people . 	0
PE	4010	Since having these products shows their status , the quality obviously is not relatively important . 	0
PE	4011	However , despite the fact that advertisements can be falseful and exaggerated , it is also true that it plays and important role economically . 	1
PE	4012	They penetrate into people ' s life , affecting people ' s choices in different things . 	0
PE	4013	Therefore , it comes to the debate whether advertising has positive influences on people ' s life . 	0
PE	4014	The advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits 	0
PE	4015	Advertising is becoming part of our modern society . 	0
PE	4016	First of all , advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit . 	1
PE	4017	The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people ' s concept of wholesome diets and self-control . 	0
PE	4018	Some people believe that these various advertisements get people to buy products that are unnecessary and only look good on television . 	1
PE	4019	In my opinion , the advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits . 	1
PE	4020	During running for 20 Kilometers in a marathon running tournament 2014 , I saw some people stopped running while the others fought until their last minute . 	0
PE	4021	At some moment , my body was telling me to stop but the choice that I made was on the contrary . 	0
PE	4022	Keep trying and never stop working for your goals 	0
PE	4023	" Keep running ! , " shouted from my heart but my legs can hardly move . 	0
PE	4024	Firstly , committing to our goal helps creating personal worth . 	1
PE	4025	For example , I realized the true potential of my body and mind as I decided to train myself hard . 	0
PE	4026	I did not stop and won a medal goals in my life at the age of nearly thirty . 	0
PE	4027	From this experience , I believe that a person should keep trying for his goals . 	1
PE	4028	Even if I were not to win this medal , I acknowledged the great amount of my endeavor as I could keep my tired legs running . 	0
PE	4029	Secondly , one who learns the great difficulty will become stronger . 	1
PE	4030	To sum up , I am strongly convinced that pets deserve to be treated like family members because of all the reasons mentioned above , namely they are our friends and they can be useful in many situations . 	1
PE	4031	As far as I am concerned , this proposal is beneficial more to the society . 	0
PE	4032	Recently , some people argue that government should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities . 	1
PE	4033	How to allocate governmental budget efficiently has always been a hot topic of discussion among the public . 	0
PE	4034	Government shouldn ' t put money on building theaters or sports stadiums 	0
PE	4035	Entertaining facilities such as cinemas , theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented . 	1
PE	4036	Therefore , providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government . 	1
PE	4037	As a matter of fact , an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals , whereas a physical damaged person , resulting from the lack of medical treatment , may no longer participate in any sports games . 	0
PE	4038	Taking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums . 	0
PE	4039	My opinion is based on creating memories with parents , saving money , and taking advice from parents . 	0
PE	4040	First of all , one of the most significant upsides is that the young adult can have more experience with his parents . 	0
PE	4041	The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market , which should not be interfered by government . 	0
PE	4042	Their existences are based on their marketing strategies , the condition of facilities and the volume of audience . 	0
PE	4043	Learning to be independent is essential for young adults 	0
PE	4044	Learning to be independent is essential for young adults . 	0
PE	4045	However , how early the children leave their parents is a difficult issue . 	0
PE	4046	In my point of view , staying with the parents for longer time does more benefits than disadvantages to the young adult . 	1
PE	4047	It is a positive encouragement for many more talented people to contribute to the world of athletics and entertainment , giving us awesome performances to enjoy . 	1
PE	4048	In conclusion , high salary for athletes is what they deserve in accordance with their own achievements and also a guarantee for quality performances . 	1
PE	4049	Second , such high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete ' s great performances . 	1
PE	4050	That ' s why the richest athletes usually correspond to the greatest athletes in their fields , namely Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods . 	0
PE	4051	They shall reap within their high salaries . 	0
PE	4052	Most of us only see the luxurious side of a rich athlete and ignore how may difficulties they ' ve gone through and how much cost they ' ve thrown into investing themselves . 	0
PE	4053	Some people might argue that the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair . 	1
PE	4054	In other words , if they are not paid high enough in order to conform to their performances , there might not be such brilliant performances for us to be amazed . 	0
PE	4055	Fairness is not about equal payments for everyone , but equal chances to acquire the same goal or accomplishment . 	0
PE	4056	However , in my opinion , as long as everyone has equal chances to pursue his / her dreams and careers , that would be fair . 	0
PE	4057	These factors affect people who work or study from home . 	1
PE	4058	Following both the point of views , the option of working or studying from home is thought to provide more benefits than drawbacks . 	1
PE	4059	Thus , the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home , are obvious . 	1
PE	4060	On the other hand , one part of the society , has doubt over the productivity of people who prefers to work or study from home . 	0
PE	4061	They save the travelling time to Universities and utilize that time on their studies . 	0
PE	4062	In a busy city like Tokyo , students waste a lot of time in travelling . 	0
PE	4063	Teachers think that students get affected too as they can not clear their doubts in study topics instantly . 	0
PE	4064	Due to this they lag in their studies . 	0
PE	4065	Many employers argue that once an employee works from isolation , he or she spends a lot of time in communication via phone or email with colleagues . 	0
PE	4066	This harms an employee ' s deliverable . 	0
PE	4067	I think TV programs are among the popular topics in every day talk as well as a great time for gathering . 	1
PE	4068	In addition Modern TV has smart system that let you be connected with people . 	1
PE	4069	First , it ' s true watching TV take a lot of your day , nevertheless it makes people meet and start a conversation about what they watch at other times like weather forecast and sport programs . 	1
PE	4070	Second , people like having meals while they are watching TV . 	1
PE	4071	Television destroys communication among friends and family 	0
PE	4072	Television is one of the greatest innovations that we use every day . 	0
PE	4073	Besides , watching television has some cons and at the same time has very good pros . 	0
PE	4074	However , while some people argue that TV has devastated communication among friends and families , I believe it has done the opposite . 	0
PE	4075	Families usually tend to watch television either with each other or friends . 	1
PE	4076	For example my friends and I used to sit together and enjoy watching movies using VHS player at nights . 	0
PE	4077	No matter how appealing the advertisements are , we should be able to make the decision on our own . 	0
PE	4078	Otherwise the market may be monopolistic , and the price as well as the choice will not be so selective . 	0
PE	4079	The power of advertising maybe over-rated , we can not deny that the final decision is on the hands of us consumers . 	1
PE	4080	They introduce new products , and provide various choices , not to mention they are often visually enjoyable , since they aim to grab your attention . 	0
PE	4081	Advertising also helps to keep prices at reasonable levels , creates a fair environment for commercial competition . 	0
PE	4082	Through million years of hunting , especially in recent centuries with the innovation of rifle and dynamite , people have killed many animals and even have made some kinds of them become extinct . 	0
PE	4083	Moreover , people , suffering from the population pressure , are expanding their living area ; consequently , the living area of other species narrowed . 	0
PE	4084	This narrowing of living region is pushing many creatures to the brink of extinction . 	0
PE	4085	All in all , from discussed reasons , we can conclude that human activity are gradually destroy the Earth since it is polluting the Earth environment , depleting the resource and imperiling other species ' lives . 	1
PE	4086	It is rare times when people can learn about this country . 	0
PE	4087	It really help to alleviate the tension . 	1
PE	4088	Besides easing tensions , an international sporting event also helps fans release patriotic emotions in a safe way . 	1
PE	4089	When they garther together to encourage their team , they will show their patriotic emotions . 	0
PE	4090	Regardless of the competition between teams , their emotions are always released in a safe way due to the sole passion of the sport . 	0
PE	4091	Moreover , all fans know that a sport event will attract the attention of whole the world and a lot of public media . 	0
PE	4092	They will try to create a beautiful image about their land and people . 	0
PE	4093	In Olympic Beijing 2008 , Chinese tried thier best to bring the world a spectacular image about their country . 	0
PE	4094	First of all , foreigners came here always received the support of friendly volunteers who were young students . 	0
PE	4095	They were welcomed by each Chinese hospitality , beauty in each cities . 	0
PE	4096	Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services . 	0
PE	4097	They further point out that the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money . 	0
PE	4098	By way of conclusion , I believe that modern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases ; however , the have-nots cannot be ignored simply because they couldn ' t afford it . 	1
PE	4099	Consequently , people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies . 	1
PE	4100	So we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal . 	1
PE	4101	They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations . 	0
PE	4102	Female candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer . 	0
PE	4103	Finally , life becoming more stressful due to some recent problems such as traffic gam , traffic accidents and others . 	0
PE	4104	Given these evidences , it can be seen that people are facing up with many recently appeared illnesses due to aforementioned reasons . 	1
PE	4105	Many people , for example , are suffering from allergy because of these gasses . 	0
PE	4106	Secondly , foods with a low quality such as fast foods , junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively . 	0
PE	4107	For instance , there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only . 	0
PE	4108	Thus , these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution . 	0
PE	4109	In order to solve these problems , alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively . 	1
PE	4110	With regard to the former , alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal . 	0
PE	4111	What is worse , traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result , it leads to an increase of traffic accidents . 	0
PE	4112	Thus , the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented . 	1
PE	4113	Since bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses , it is a better form to protect environment than automobile . 	0
PE	4114	As for the latter point , the introduction of international laws can be also effective . 	0
PE	4115	For example , rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries . 	0
PE	4116	This system is that at the corner of each district , the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee . 	0
PE	4117	Last but not least , nowadays , there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work . 	1
PE	4118	Therefore , it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better . 	1
PE	4119	These women will set a good example for their children . 	0
PE	4120	These things in turn will make them more confident , independent . 	0
PE	4121	In conclusion , a well-organized home does not need the housewife ' s presence the whole day long and married women could go to work in order to enjoy the working life outside the home . 	1
PE	4122	Besides the gorvernment ' s policies on limited families and their husbands ' sharing in the housework , many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women . 	0
PE	4123	First of all , more and more people have the opportunity to receive education from university . 	0
PE	4124	Since our parents receive better education than our grandparents did , they can provide more advices and helps in our career . 	1
PE	4125	The opportunity to receive education from university 	0
PE	4126	There are many factors that contribute to one ' s success . 	0
PE	4127	However , which factor is the most influential one is open to debate . 	0
PE	4128	Some people believe that nowadays the assitance from family is quite a essential factor in one ' s success . 	0
PE	4129	It seems that one can achieve success more easily with the help from his or her family . 	1
PE	4130	I agree with this statement . 	0
PE	4131	In my opinion , family plays a more important role in helping one to pursuit success . 	1
PE	4132	There are a couple of reasons . 	0
PE	4133	In conclusion , I would rather classify myself in the proponents of globalization as a speeding factor of global progress . 	1
PE	4134	I think it is more likely to solve the problems of the world rather than intensifying them . 	0
PE	4135	Because , classroom could provide real actual example to make students more understand in their subject . 	0
PE	4136	Besides , classroom courses are also provide students to learn social skill . 	0
PE	4137	From personal level , it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations . 	0
PE	4138	However , sacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences . 	1
PE	4139	This is because they have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities . 	0
PE	4140	Firstly , fresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation . 	0
PE	4141	Compared with aged staffs , younger employees are often physically stronger and energetic which enables them to carry out heavy workload to meet the deadline . 	0
PE	4142	Secondly , having a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency . 	0
PE	4143	Nowadays the discussion about whether the businesses are supposed to prescribe the retirement age at fifty-five to offer more job vacancies for younger generation has become a controversy . 	0
PE	4144	Early retirement for 55 + employees to help younger people 	0
PE	4145	Admittedly , encouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty-five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits . 	1
PE	4146	Some believe that is a perfect attempt to support the young , others claim that this is not the case . 	0
PE	4147	I hold this belief due to the improvement of students ' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards . 	1
PE	4148	These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time . 	0
PE	4149	To conclude , it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students . 	1
PE	4150	However , in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims . 	0
PE	4151	By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves . 	1
PE	4152	And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people . 	0
PE	4153	Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being . 	0
PE	4154	Finally one night , having fun with his irresponsible friend in his luxuries car , he crashed a truck and died . 	0
PE	4155	Not only did he cause lots of damage to the society property , but also bring sorry to his family . 	0
PE	4156	I found that I should manage the way that I spend money . 	0
PE	4157	From then I learned to be economical and now I have every thing I wanted . 	0
PE	4158	Another aspect of learning children to manage their money is on the finance of the family . 	0
PE	4159	If parents get the children all they wanted , they would be run out of their money for their essential needs . 	0
PE	4160	Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money , when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity . 	1
PE	4161	As a case in point , I had a friend to had a rich and prosperous family , his parent gave him everything he demanded from his childhood . 	0
PE	4162	He became an arrogant person who could not stand on his feet and always asked for money . 	0
PE	4163	His parent tried a lot and hired some experts to learn him manage his financial and carrier life , but unfortunately it was useless . 	0
PE	4164	For example , Chanda Kochhar , who is the CEO of India ' s second largest bank called ICICI bank and prominently awarded as the country ' s most powerful female head in business sector . 	0
PE	4165	In addition , due to increasing exposure on current affairs and knowledge on cutting-edge technological developments , female graduates are more willing to take huge responsibilities in their workplace , despite its intensive stress and pressure . 	0
PE	4166	In today ' s context , education is the most significant factor which ultimately determines one ' s future . 	0
PE	4167	Every student either male or female should be given equal opportunity 	0
PE	4168	There appear to be various reasons often strike in my mind in support of this position . 	0
PE	4169	In my personal opinion , I am totally agreed with the view that there should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university courses . 	1
PE	4170	Nowadays , both male and female students are equally competitive to each other and deserve to produce impressive results in various field of education . 	0
PE	4171	To begin with , judging student ' s skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular . 	1
PE	4172	Furthermore , female students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops , unlike previous generation females . 	1
PE	4173	In India , for example , female students are more often likely to grab more number of top scorer positions in every year higher secondary school examinations . 	0
PE	4174	In this sense , people with lower level of education have more proneness to be attracted in such isms . 	0
PE	4175	For example , most of the terroristic groups try to attract uneducated people , because the person with better education has a wider outlook , which will allow no brainwash . 	0
PE	4176	As a result , they can be proselytized into bad isms . 	0
PE	4177	Moreover , these people will not have an access to a good education . 	0
PE	4178	To begin with , children from poorer families are prone to have bad habits such as : crime , thievery and thuggery . 	1
PE	4179	However , I completely disagree with this position . 	0
PE	4180	According to some people , child who is brought up in less well-off family is more quick-witted and can tackle with an adult life problems better than who is from affluent ones . 	0
PE	4181	Children from poorer families are more successful in the future life . 	0
PE	4182	Secondly , children from rich families have better skills on how to use money , because they use it a lot of times . 	1
PE	4183	Nevertheless , people who are born in well-off families have access to good education , which will have a positive impact on their later life . 	1
PE	4184	Common belief that a jury should obtain all information regarding a suspect has fostered some lawyers to protest against the current rules in those two countries . 	0
PE	4185	Many people hold the opinion that past behaviour determines the future actions , which could be the main reason to support the idea of revealing the record to the jury . 	1
PE	4186	Jury must have access to criminals ' past records 	0
PE	4187	Courts of many countries provide a jury with the history of a defendant , except those of the UK and Australia . 	0
PE	4188	Nevertheless , in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience , the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only . 	1
PE	4189	For instance , a defendant with number of past crimes has more chance to be found guilty compared to a person with no or lighter criminal record . 	0
PE	4190	We must acknowledge that complete data concerning the history of a sued person creates more opportunity for jury members to build an overall picture of defendant ' s personality . 	0
PE	4191	Furthermore , past record might be useful to decide whether a person was able to perform a certain type of crime when it concerns serious crimes , such as kidnapping or a murder . 	0
PE	4192	Innocent suspects , eventually , can face unfair juridical decision and pay twice for their previous inadequate actions . 	0
PE	4193	In conclusion , I am skeptical about disclosing the defendant ' s history to the jury , with intention to avoid subjective and probable inaccurate verdict . 	1
PE	4194	The custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture . 	0
PE	4195	When people migrate to a new country , they are likely to suffer the culture shock , because of the difference between two cultures . 	0
PE	4196	On one hand , it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country , if they follow the new customs . 	1
PE	4197	On the other hand , keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination . 	1
PE	4198	As a result , people understand the culture , and then they adapt to the new country . 	0
PE	4199	Youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis . 	0
PE	4200	Fortunately , some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol , cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries . 	0
PE	4201	We come across with ads almost everywhere and everyday . 	0
PE	4202	Some people argue that companies by advertising their goods or services spend their money for nothing . 	0
PE	4203	Society should ban all forms of the advertising 	0
PE	4204	It is no secret that advertising become inseparable part of our modern life . 	0
PE	4205	Society does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers . 	1
PE	4206	First of all , I do support the idea that advertising alcohol , cigarettes , goods and services with adult content should be prohibited because these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children . 	1
PE	4207	Other critics say that ads have no purpose , they only cause damages to society and all forms of advertising should be banned . 	0
PE	4208	On my part I would like to solve this issue on a different way . 	0
PE	4209	It has become essential for a person to learn at least one foreign language as one do interacts with foreigners once in a lifetime and learning a foreign langauge adds on to a person skill-set as well . 	0
PE	4210	Others believe that they are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention . 	0
PE	4211	In my opinion , we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment . 	1
PE	4212	Should animals be free or live in zoos ? 	0
PE	4213	Many people state that zoos are a great asset to animals . 	0
PE	4214	Skills which help them live and survive in their residing areas . 	0
PE	4215	When we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with , they begin to loose those in-born instincts . 	0
PE	4216	Many scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals . 	1
PE	4217	Firstly , like we , human beings , animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts . 	0
PE	4218	Hence , when they are released or in the worst case , when they escape , they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate . 	0
PE	4219	In addition to the previous point , various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care . 	1
PE	4220	They kept researching new technology and became successful at a very young age . 	1
PE	4221	Nonetheless , with the development of technology , increasingly more young people become obsessed with high-tech products . 	0
PE	4222	In comfortable conditions , children may be satisfied with the world around them and refuse to make a change . 	0
PE	4223	Recently , there is a very creative advertisements of a soft drink product on TV . 	0
PE	4224	When the consumers are impressed by the way a product is advertised , they can be convinced to consider that the product is a need in some cases . 	0
PE	4225	However , it is not sufficient in itself . 	0
PE	4226	The most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product is through advertising . 	1
PE	4227	Everyday , companies offer a huge number of different products to consumers . 	0
PE	4228	Advertisements affects on consumer goods 	0
PE	4229	Therefore , advertisers push the limits of creativity to dispose the consumers to purchase the product . 	1
PE	4230	We are mainly introduced to products through advertisements . 	0
PE	4231	In my opinion , advertising is the major reason for high sales of a product for several reasons . 	1
PE	4232	The product also should satisfy the needs of the consumers . 	0
PE	4233	Environmental protection and economic developments might be the biggest issues in the 21st century . 	0
PE	4234	Environmental protection vs Economic developments 	0
PE	4235	However , since the budget and the recourse are limited , governments must choose between these two issues . 	0
PE	4236	They are both important because they are vital to human ' s future and welfare . 	0
PE	4237	The following are reasons why . 	0
PE	4238	In my opinion , I believe that tackling down environmental problems is of the first priority rather than economic developments . 	1
PE	4239	All the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one . 	0
PE	4240	First , environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments . 	1
PE	4241	Just like a man that needs a healthy body , all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well . 	0
PE	4242	Without Earth , whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain because we will all perish as she ' s gone . 	0
PE	4243	It is hoped that people will continue to use internet to work or study and improve on the disadvantages into the foreseeable future . 	0
PE	4244	Cultural events such as exhibitions and theatre plays can enrich one ' s and widen his horizons , things which aren ' t offered by small towns . 	1
PE	4245	Another thing that put big cities in front of small towns is the facilitates and services it contains which support and improve the quality of its inhabitants ' lives , hospitals , advanced medical facilities can satisfy one ' s need of medical safety . 	1
PE	4246	Continuous technological and economical development in modern world created great differences between cities , a difference that is clearly visible in the size of various cities . 	0
PE	4247	Living in big cities or living in small towns 	0
PE	4248	This diversities in cities allowed for more difference in people ' s preferences for where to live . 	0
PE	4249	From cities with more that 20 million people to small towns inhabited by only hundreds of people . 	0
PE	4250	First of all , I find the excitement of big cities to be attractive , living in a dynamic environment can turn into a very rich experience that sharpens one ' s personality and open one ' s eyes on the real world . 	1
PE	4251	For me , I prefer to live in bigger cities than in small ones , this personal attitude is the result of many factors . 	1
PE	4252	For me , this lifestyles is very attractive and is considered a huge advantage of big cities compared with the constant , slow paced life styles of small towns . 	0
PE	4253	Life in big cities cities gives one new challenges every day , let it be deciding which restaurant to go to or deciding which company to work for . 	0
PE	4254	It is widely known that the press provide the public with criminal content in order to increase newspaper circulation and TV rating . 	0
PE	4255	Personally , I believe such details should be strictly censored , if not banned altogether . 	1
PE	4256	Nowadays , the print as well as the electronic media tend to dedicate large amounts of airtime and space to detailed reports about crimes . 	0
PE	4257	Detailed description of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society 	0
PE	4258	The potential market in those poor countries , most of which has a huge population , is also a thing worth mentioning . 	0
PE	4259	By building a good relationship with them , wealthy nations can not only broaden their global market , but also facilitate future international commerce . 	0
PE	4260	Consequently , a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased , exaggerated or fraudulent , which only result to terrorize communities and leave law-aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes . 	1
PE	4261	These days the primary purpose of journalists covering the details of criminal acts is , more often than that , to boost newspaper circulations and TV ratings . 	0
PE	4262	Compassion , a virtue preached in almost all religions from Buddhism to Mohammedanism , is what distinguishes us human beings from animals . 	0
PE	4263	Economically speaking , such aid could also create a win-win situation . 	1
PE	4264	Most importantly , particular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes because they have already suffered greatly for what they have experienced . 	1
PE	4265	For developed nations , new medical problems may very well arise from the work in underdeveloped nations ; thus related research is conducted accordingly to conquer the problem , promoting the development of the pharmaceutical industry . 	0
PE	4266	Should wealthy nations support poor ones ? 	0
PE	4267	Whether wealthy nations should take responsibilities to help poorer ones , by means of providing infrastructures , or remain bystander of the global poverty , is an issue of controversy . 	0
PE	4268	Personally I think , as the privileged minority , wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor . 	1
PE	4269	In terms of ethics , it is inhumane to watch one ' s fellowman struggle against famine and poverty without doing anything to help , especially when the onlooker takes no effort to do so . 	1
PE	4270	We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart . 	0
PE	4271	They opine that now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back . 	0
PE	4272	They argue that it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment . 	0
PE	4273	Some people say that if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment . 	1
PE	4274	On the other hand there are people who say that technology alone could save the environment . 	1
PE	4275	If people don ' t use air conditioners , automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us , then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment . 	0
PE	4276	It is irrefutable that progress in technology leads to environmental problems . 	0
PE	4277	Can technology alone solve the world ' s environmental problems ? 	0
PE	4278	In the following paragraphs , I intend to discuss both viewpoints . 	0
PE	4279	Some individuals are of the opinion that if people live a simple life and do not use the things that technology has brought us then these problems can be solved whereas others opine that only technology can solve these problems . 	0
PE	4280	Back in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car . 	0
PE	4281	It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings . 	1
PE	4282	Finally , with savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams . 	0
PE	4283	He could not afford the maintenance so he had to sell it . 	0
PE	4284	For instance , I made a month-long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend . 	0
PE	4285	Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished . 	1
PE	4286	Considering all the above mentioned arguments , from my point of view there is no other choice than saving money for some time . 	1
PE	4287	Without our savings we could not have pursued our long-time dream . 	0
PE	4288	People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want . 	0
PE	4289	Especially , thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging ( SMS ) , it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information , even to many people at the same time . 	0
PE	4290	Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness , difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information . 	0
PE	4291	However , email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above . 	0
PE	4292	First of all , it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging , which answers to the question of their great popularity . 	1
PE	4293	Before email and mobile phone , human beings communicated by meeting directly , sending letters or later , calling from home phones . 	0
PE	4294	With this situation , some people believe that they may be factors decreasing the position of written language . 	1
PE	4295	I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means . 	0
PE	4296	Email and text messaging threats written language 	0
PE	4297	The introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication . 	0
PE	4298	Humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit ? 	0
PE	4299	Man has dominated all his fellow beings on earth because of his superior brain . 	0
PE	4300	He has domesticated a large number of animals and birds and makes use of them to make life easier and convenient for himself . 	0
PE	4301	Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs , while others are concerned that animals should not be misused . 	0
PE	4302	This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication . 	0
PE	4303	Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as , cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them . 	1
PE	4304	Likewise , other animals such as , horses , cattles and donkeys for farming , agriculture and as a mode of transportation . 	0
PE	4305	Many people keep pets like dogs and cats , trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples . 	0
PE	4306	They are kept for security purposes in houses . 	0
PE	4307	On the other hand , many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits . 	1
PE	4308	For example , the cell phone , which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance , now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications . 	0
PE	4309	In conclusion , as I believe that consumers should consider major needs when they purchase goods , high sales are obviously a reflection of the powerful advertisements . 	1
PE	4310	They make the product preferable . 	1
PE	4311	Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well-known product . 	1
PE	4312	Also , the more an advertisement of a product takes place in mass media , the more popular the product becomes . 	0
PE	4313	As a result of this , the number of that product being sold will increases . 	0
PE	4314	The story delivers a desired call to drink that soft drink that people tend to drink when the weather is too hot . 	0
PE	4315	Considering this fact , advertisements have undeniable affects on the society about the product being advertised . 	0
PE	4316	However , it also has to be affordable for the consumer . 	0
PE	4317	When a product is commonly used , it becomes trustworthy for the society , no matter what quality it is . 	0
PE	4318	Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product . 	0
PE	4319	Firstly , celebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans . 	0
PE	4320	Nevertheless , I believe that other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments . 	1
PE	4321	If they continue to behave in such a way , it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work . 	0
PE	4322	For example , some movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media , thereby gaining the public attention . 	0
PE	4323	This is detrimental to study and work ethics and habits . 	0
PE	4324	Consequently , the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status . 	1
PE	4325	Some people think that celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyle rather than the work they do . 	0
PE	4326	Some celebrities misguide young people& some guide them in right direction 	0
PE	4327	It is true that some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public . 	0
PE	4328	While I agree this will bring negative impacts on the younger generation , this is not necessarily the case for those celebrities who are ambitious in their jobs . 	1
PE	4329	Therefore , this kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance . 	0
PE	4330	This means that people understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results . 	0
PE	4331	Take Michael Jackson as an example , his works are widely spread around the world , and have been extremely welcomed by the younger generation . 	0
PE	4332	Secondly , other celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career . 	0
PE	4333	In summary , although some celebrities misguide young people by showing their external wealth and appearance , other celebrities do lead young people in the right direction . 	1
PE	4334	His songs spread the idea that people should care about each other , which suggests to young people how to become a good member of society . 	0
PE	4335	The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society . 	1
PE	4336	In my opinion , there is nothing more important than health in a human ' s life and the happiness and welfare come with health . 	0
PE	4337	Totally , the most important reason for me to be self-employed is the sense of free . 	0
PE	4338	Moreover , earning money is the fundamental reason that why people work . 	0
PE	4339	Some people may argue that children will be more material , neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers . 	1
PE	4340	For example , if a child works as a shop assistant , he will have to keep an eye on good and products , calculate prices correctly and take responsibilities for any lost . 	0
PE	4341	I recommend that parents should help their children to choose a suitable job which does not affect their children ' s study and that the government should have right policies to avoid exploiting children ' s labour . 	0
PE	4342	Work for themselves vs work for employer 	0
PE	4343	Most people want to work for an employer , because they want to feel secure about their salary , or feel comfortable about other problems of having own job such as paying tax , worrying about selling , etc . Despite these problems , personally , I would prefer to have my own job . 	1
PE	4344	My arguments are listed as follows . 	0
PE	4345	First , time is the more valuable thing , which I have in my life . 	1
PE	4346	By having my own business , I can manage my own time . 	0
PE	4347	I could work whenever I want , or I do not need to give reasons to my boss for a delay . 	0
PE	4348	I can arrange time to travel when I would like . 	0
PE	4349	In addition , I can work long hours for earning more money . 	0
PE	4350	Moreover , classroom could provide exercise class to set students to have a good health . 	0
PE	4351	Thus , having classroom could provide abundant skills to students . 	1
PE	4352	A student is good or not do not depend on whether he has a good teacher but is decided by his effort on study . 	0
PE	4353	It is useless to hire a super famous teacher to teach those who behaviors as sluggards . 	0
PE	4354	Admittedly , on the other hand , there might be some people proclaiming that schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers because they can impart their students well . 	1
PE	4355	However , according to my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence . 	0
PE	4356	With this distinguished performance , the student would acquire an unforgettable and valuable experience burring deeply in his mind . 	0
PE	4357	Hence , from this case , we are capable of stating that students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities . 	1
PE	4358	Consider a circumstance in which a student who is a member of jazz ensemble in their school . 	0
PE	4359	He must need a better auditorium for him to have an extraordinary performance . 	0
PE	4360	Moreover , another equally crucial aspect is that students are not always staying in classrooms . 	0
PE	4361	They have numerous activities in school . 	0
PE	4362	For youngsters , maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not . 	0
PE	4363	For example , my younger sister likes fencing , and thanks to her desire to win , she never gives up when facing a difficult situation , or even becoming hurt . 	0
PE	4364	On the other hand , adults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately . 	0
PE	4365	In fact , a competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues . 	0
PE	4366	Because of that , they no longer play games for any moderate achievements , and gradually lose their interest in such activities . 	0
PE	4367	To sum up , I think adults do need to play games , but their styles are often distinct from children ' s , which are often less competitive and more enjoyable . 	1
PE	4368	Along with the high requirement for family and work , games are just some leisure activities for adults , not something necessary as they are meant to be for children . 	1
PE	4369	When in dilemma , the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand . 	0
PE	4370	In conclusion , more emphasis should be laid on human beings other than animals , and it is better to let nature take its course with regard to species extinction . 	1
PE	4371	Furthermore , human beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation , disease and wars . 	0
PE	4372	On most occasions , the process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it . 	0
PE	4373	We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species . 	1
PE	4374	When these problems are taken into account , extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help . 	0
PE	4375	In conclusion , young age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art and they are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage , but in every stage . 	1
PE	4376	Music and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his / her life . 	1
PE	4377	Furthermore , the city has well-organised lines of transport . 	0
PE	4378	Meeting and knowing new people ' s tradition is an unforgettable experience , which could influence on one ' s previous habits . 	0
PE	4379	Moreover , in the urban areas there are also more citizens what means , that the culture diversity is huge . 	1
PE	4380	Of course living in a city is more expensive , but incomes are higher too . 	0
PE	4381	There are not only more jobs , but they are also well-paid . 	0
PE	4382	In addition , I believe that city provides more work opportunities than the countryside . 	1
PE	4383	This means , that the schools and the universities have well equipped classes and the famous professors would like to work in such places . 	0
PE	4384	Firstly , in the city there is much better education system . 	1
PE	4385	As far as I am concerned , I agree with the statement that life in a city is much better than life in the countryside . 	1
PE	4386	Life in a city is much better than life in the countryside 	0
PE	4387	That is why many governments around the world invest more money on developing public transportation facilities . 	0
PE	4388	People opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs . 	0
PE	4389	It is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity . 	0
PE	4390	This can be seen no where clearer than in increasing use of machines now a days . 	0
PE	4391	Advancements in technology have touched new heights in past few decades . 	0
PE	4392	Stress may be a positive mobilization to drive for success . 	0
PE	4393	Besides , people are draining the Earth ' s natural resources . 	1
PE	4394	These resources such as oil , coal are vital for human activity , therefore nowadays , the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people . 	0
PE	4395	Stress , our body ' s way of responding to any kind of demand , can be caused by both good and bad experiences . 	0
PE	4396	Some people advocate the idea that human activity is advantageously influencing to the Earth . 	0
PE	4397	However , I strongly believe that human activities are having a bad effect upon our planet , for human are polluting the Earth ' s environment , exhausting natural resource and threatening the living of other species . 	1
PE	4398	Some people believe that the Earth is being harmed by human 	0
PE	4399	Whether human activity is making the Earth a better place to live or damaging it is a debatable issue . 	0
PE	4400	These wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a " new " continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage . 	0
PE	4401	Furthermore , the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air , causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain , global warming or climate change . 	0
PE	4402	People are corrupting their ecosphere . 	1
PE	4403	In recent decades , concurrently with the increase of human consume , the waste discarded by human also multiplies . 	0
PE	4404	However , it is widely thought that we experience stress any time , which comes across unexpectedly that frustrates our goals . 	0
PE	4405	Therefore , government should spend money on preservation of old buildings . 	1
PE	4406	Some people think that life is a struggle , which means we may encounter numerous difficulties during our lives . 	0
PE	4407	There is no chance to renovate to save a history site once it ' s gone . 	0
PE	4408	This reality brings us to light the importance of locating and saving old buildings of historic significance . 	0
PE	4409	What is a very important skill a person should learn 	0
PE	4410	Here are my reasons . 	0
PE	4411	Accordingly , stress management , how to survive our unbearable stress , is the most important skill that we should have . 	1
PE	4412	In conclusion , a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being . 	1
PE	4413	On the other hand , schools and university are places in which students gather to be educated and learn from each others as well as formal educators . 	0
PE	4414	It will be good for children , because indirectly they will learn how to socialize each other as a team . 	0
PE	4415	That will make children getting lots of friends , so they can contribute positively to community . 	0
PE	4416	Secondly , playing sport makes children getting healthy and become children ' s well-being . 	0
PE	4417	In conclusion , both studying hard at school and playing sports can improve children ' s future . 	1
PE	4418	At the same time , playing sports will give good effects on children . 	1
PE	4419	There are many popular sports among children such as football , basketball , and volleyball . 	0
PE	4420	Also , there are many benefit when children doing sport . 	0
PE	4421	Firstly , children who always playing sport like football , they will be active as a person and learn to become team-player . 	0
PE	4422	However , university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills . 	0
PE	4423	University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain . 	0
PE	4424	The learning process itself , however , is the most important and powerful way of evaluating a student . 	0
PE	4425	Nevertheless , professors could teach students through research and projects . 	1
PE	4426	It ' s an essential learning process . 	1
PE	4427	Passing the exams is not the terminal purpose of learning . 	0
PE	4428	It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people . 	0
PE	4429	It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed . 	0
PE	4430	Universtiy is an entrance to life . 	0
PE	4431	University education restriction 	0
PE	4432	Besides , it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done . 	0
PE	4433	To be precise , such abstract or complicated informatin , easily absorbed by those students , may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills . 	0
PE	4434	To begin with , outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage . 	1
PE	4435	Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached . 	0
PE	4436	Also , without sufficient guidance of teachers , these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes , posing a threat to other citizens ' security . 	0
PE	4437	As a result , such people might fail to get cured in time , thus influencing their working efficiency , which would destabilize the production of the industry . 	0
PE	4438	The long and the short of it , both arts and public services are important to the community and should be invested properly . 	1
PE	4439	Only those who sympathize with their fellowman can prosper in the long run . 	1
PE	4440	The underdeveloped nations , in return , may export local agricultural products , mineral products with discount to the former , boosting each other ' s economy . 	0
PE	4441	In summary , wealthy nations ' offering in need is not only a moral deed , but also a worthwhile one which will one day pay off in other ways . 	1
PE	4442	Alternatively I believe that it should taken into consideration the situation and conditions , that forces to a person to be a criminal . 	1
PE	4443	Some people think that it does not matter what is reason behind committing a crime therefore there should be fixed punishment for a specific crime . 	0
PE	4444	Generally reason behind punishment is to reduce the crime from a nation and to build a fear in the mind of offenders . 	0
PE	4445	Some people believe that there should be fixed punishment for each crime type 	0
PE	4446	On the contrary , fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government . 	1
PE	4447	The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place . 	0
PE	4448	Secondly , laws and rules are there for people therefore it is necessary to have a look behind crime for instance " a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women , who steals for her drug addiction " . 	1
PE	4449	First of all if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime because the punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime . 	1
PE	4450	Therefore fixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other . 	1
PE	4451	Everyone should be treated equally because sometimes we see that a poor person who do not have much money for hiring a good lawyer they get imprisoned even without committing a crime and when they come back to the society they become a professional criminal . 	0
PE	4452	Now that , it has useful and educational programs and quite helpful to relieve stresses for children . 	0
PE	4453	For these reasons , I strongly disagree with the statement that television has negative effects on children . 	1
PE	4454	Instead , this soccer match helped me to continue my academic career in the school , since it helped me to relieve my stress . 	0
PE	4455	In conclusion , of course , the television can have violent programs , however , if children can use Tv programs wisely , there are more positive effects than negative effects . 	1
PE	4456	Therefore , I would conclude that a single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication . 	1
PE	4457	On the other hand , every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage . 	1
PE	4458	I believe friends are people who have great compatibility with each other . 	0
PE	4459	First , it ' s not easy to make friend with anyone . 	0
PE	4460	Sometimes acquaintances are just acquaintances . 	0
PE	4461	After two years in college I have found sometimes there is more differences between people than similarities , for we are growing in the different families and was educated in various ways . 	0
PE	4462	There is no need for me to put any emphasis on the advantage of having a large number of casual acquaintance . 	0
PE	4463	One or two close friends vs . a large number of casual acquaintances 	0
PE	4464	We can not deny that being a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant . 	0
PE	4465	However , I still agree that it ' s better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances . 	1
PE	4466	So , it ' s much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends . 	1
PE	4467	We spend time together but we could never be friend . 	0
PE	4468	If the teachers receive higher salaries , they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth , as this is what is happening in Taiwan . 	0
PE	4469	Nevertheless , I believe that creating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances . 	1
PE	4470	Workers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss ' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile . 	0
PE	4471	For instance , junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students ' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work due to the fact that it is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want . 	0
PE	4472	In this essay , I would start by analyzing the factors for higher yields and finish by stating my position on this . 	0
PE	4473	A raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places . 	1
PE	4474	Paying more money is the only motivation to make employees work harder 	0
PE	4475	The purpose of this essay is to discuss whether or not the only way to motivate employees to be more hard-working and productive is by raising their salaries . 	0
PE	4476	Take Google for example , the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce . 	0
PE	4477	By doing this , the employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured . 	0
PE	4478	Unlike middle school or high school , university and college require far a lot of ability and skills to keep up with an enormous amount of complex knowledge . 	0
PE	4479	First , focusing only on talented students is a better option because it helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality . 	1
PE	4480	That explains why it is only suitable for a limited people , and opening up for everyone will be fatal for institutions , since they need to somehow lower the materials so that it is practical for everyone . 	0
PE	4481	In fact , some students may be capable in high schools , but the pressure of higher education is tough even for talented ones . 	0
PE	4482	Nevertheless , it has not changed the importance of teachers ' role in classes . 	0
PE	4483	University education should be only available for good students 	0
PE	4484	However , in my opinion , it should be better to leave this type of type of training for a certain group of good , knowledgeable learners . 	1
PE	4485	Some people think that all students should deserve to be educated at this level . 	0
PE	4486	Secondly , people can know more about the planet earth itself . 	1
PE	4487	For example , if one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual , full-length Buddhist sutra in Buddha ' s Birthday in India , he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture . 	0
PE	4488	To picture it , recently , Putin was pleased to open the last winter Olympic games and gather international countries , but actually it has been just facade and Putin didn ' t listen international warning after he conquered the Crimea . 	0
PE	4489	After the Olympics games are finished , everything came back to normal and all the game competition is forgotten by the majority . 	0
PE	4490	In other words , this is the " calm before the storm " . 	0
PE	4491	Thus , if the general atmosphere during the show is peaceful and fraternal , the reality is different . 	0
PE	4492	These meetings are in none case here to interact with international affairs . 	1
PE	4493	Finally , an international sports event is a very good thing to gather people , let them dream , being proud of their nationality and forget problems , but just for a while . 	1
PE	4494	When people move to another country , most likely , they will face the choice between following the customs of the new country or keeping their original one . 	0
PE	4495	Follow the New Customs of the New Country or Not ? 	0
PE	4496	The maintenance of traditional skills and ways of life ? 	0
PE	4497	There is no doubt the application of technological developments in some countries will be accompanied with modern skills and new lifestyles . 	0
PE	4498	It is argued that these so-called cultural invasions will result in the distinction of national traditions , and there is no need to maintain them . 	0
PE	4499	However , from my point of view , what can be expected , is a change of the role of the tradition but not its disappearance from the society . 	1
PE	4500	It is undeniable that the country ' s culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life . 	1
PE	4501	For instance , in Vietnam , many water puppet shows which once demonstrated our seasonal agriculture and communal activities , are today substituted by cinemas and music concerts . 	0
PE	4502	This means the young generation can solely get access to their ancestor ' s early life through books and images , which otherwise would be much more easily absorbed . 	0
PE	4503	In tradition , a person should look back at the past , mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle , to progress . 	1
PE	4504	Understanding why , and how our predecessors survived through thick and thin will probably be invaluable lessons for us today . 	0
PE	4505	Also , study form their mistakes helps us accomplish our goal with smooth sailing . 	0
PE	4506	Secondly , there are some drawbacks about this issue . 	0
PE	4507	Besides , nowadays technology is entering into our society really quick and scientists develop robots , which help people cope with their problems or just invent coffee machines , engines with integrated computers and etc . For example , before centeries , there were not washing machines , which clean your clothes , while a person do another job . 	1
PE	4508	These are two of the benefits , why IT is useful . 	0
PE	4509	In addition , World Wide Web offers humanity to access to information , which they want to know for less than 10 seconds . 	1
PE	4510	Firstly , connecting people by email is easy and fast . 	1
PE	4511	World Wide Web and communication via email are some of the positive sides of information technology , however , there are some negative aspects . 	0
PE	4512	Decade after decade , every day , scientists discover magnificent devices in the field of IT , such as interactive boards , multicore computers and laptops , tablets , which have an incredible resolution and also mobile phones , which have the power of a computer . 	0
PE	4513	There have been significant developments in the field of IT ! 	0
PE	4514	All this inventions will try to take control of the Earth . 	1
PE	4515	Scientists believe that one day people will face their developments , for instance robots , and they will not succeed to control them . 	0
PE	4516	For those reasons , it is natural to support the professors spending more time on doing research . 	1
PE	4517	While extending the way of their own development , the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society . 	1
PE	4518	Of course you need to choose a good neighborhood . 	0
PE	4519	I hold this belief because of two main reasons , academic and social reasons . 	1
PE	4520	We have to accept these changes for a world to be a better place . 	0
PE	4521	To conclude , I believe change is inevitable and that usage of one language across the world is a positive one . 	1
PE	4522	We did play video-games , but that wasn ' t our main activity . 	0
PE	4523	In a big city there are more kinds of people and more things to do . 	0
PE	4524	Some people thinks that if a child grows up in a big city they will be all day at home at the computer or at the video-game , but this is not true if you live in a neighborhood with other people about your age as I did . 	1
PE	4525	My friends and I used to play soccer , bike , climb trees and do a lot of other stuff every day . 	0
PE	4526	On the other hand , few people are worried about the dying local languages . 	1
PE	4527	Adding to that , exchange of knowledge in different sectors of research like electronics , medical , astronomy etc would become easier . 	0
PE	4528	Single language also reduces misunderstandings between people . 	0
PE	4529	Furthermore , students who migrate for better education would not have to go through lot of stress as they can easily make new friends and can be part of any discussions which is otherwise not possible in a world with multiple languages ; this in turn makes it easy to adjust in new environment . 	0
PE	4530	Further , these languages are tightly coupled with history ; all the olden day literature and scripts will be impossible to decipher if these languages are lost . 	0
PE	4531	As the usage of these languages decrease , culture also changes accordingly . 	0
PE	4532	They represent local culture . 	0
PE	4533	These languages are the basis for the origination and initial communication between different cultures . 	0
PE	4534	By participating in it , I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments . 	0
PE	4535	The research project provides a more efficient way of teaching . 	0
PE	4536	They can see lots of picture and videos of many interesting places . 	0
PE	4537	Moreover , people can learn other countries ' s culture and tradition which makes them have more knowledge about that nations . 	0
PE	4538	To conclude , people are satisfied with the internet and sometimes even thanks it because it helps us in studying , doing business and exploring the world . 	1
PE	4539	With valuable information it provides , people can enjoy their lives much more . 	1
PE	4540	Not only students but also everyone could get more information and knowledge . 	0
PE	4541	For instance , people who have problems with their health can search for more information about it . 	0
PE	4542	Last but not least , The internet makes the world becomes smaller which is a good thing . 	1
PE	4543	This is because people who have no time or have financial problems could travel around the world by using the internet . 	0
PE	4544	Thus , to cope with the physiological and psychological changes of adult life , to make financial life a less struggle and to prevent oneself digress from their destined path , it is important for young adults to live with their parents for a longer period of time . 	1
PE	4545	In a nutshell , I believe that young adults should only consider living on their own only after they are sure they could sustain on their own . 	1
PE	4546	It is unwise to trade the opportunity of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs . 	0
PE	4547	However , I believe that most young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have . 	0
PE	4548	It is good thing if living with parents does not give freedom for young people to party all night , smoke or do drugs . 	0
PE	4549	Young adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own , and thus missing the valuable input of their parents . 	0
PE	4550	While some critics may argue that , young adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want . 	1
PE	4551	This type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good . 	0
PE	4552	To conclude , I want to say that it is very important to be confident of the information , which you use , especially when your conclusion or decision may have a great influence . 	1
PE	4553	The gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the " salt-panic " was over . 	0
PE	4554	Sometimes it can be really difficult to find out the facts , especially in the internet , that ' s why you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts . 	1
PE	4555	Secondly , it is very important to know facts about some events or problem , not only estimations , because it can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate . 	0
PE	4556	For example , several years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week , because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops . 	0
PE	4557	It is possible to make a wrong decision because you have just used someone ' s personal opinion as a source of information , but it was actually wrong . 	0
PE	4558	Therefore , I decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well ! 	0
PE	4559	After that exam , I felt depressed and exhausted . 	0
PE	4560	As a case in point , last month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back . 	0
PE	4561	In my viewpoint , our body and moral health depend to physical activities directly . 	0
PE	4562	First , besides the good body shape , sports have very vital effects on human ' s healthfulness . 	0
PE	4563	In the following , I will state my reason for this choice . 	0
PE	4564	Although multitudes of people think that sports and social activities are not as necessary as academic subjects in colleges , I think that these activities have the same efficient role in students ' lives . 	1
PE	4565	It is very subjective decision for students to have or not have these facilities . 	0
PE	4566	There are a lot of debates about the importance of sports and social activities in contrast with the main classes . 	0
PE	4567	Financial support for sports and social activities 	0
PE	4568	In order to achieve this , they start cultivating their children when they are very young . 	0
PE	4569	Every parents expect their children to be outstanding and successful . 	0
PE	4570	An integration of music into learning process bound to be successful when it is not compulsory . 	1
PE	4571	On the other hand , music can help an individual to shape its character . 	1
PE	4572	Some people believe that paying tax is the only responsibility of citizens , while others disagree and think that being a person in society involves more responsibilities . 	0
PE	4573	Taxes are the income for every country in the world and they are extremely important for developing countries . 	0
PE	4574	The first reason why people are willing to visit museums when they travel to a new territory is that museums provide a tremendous amount of information about different aspects of the history and culture of that place , as I said back . 	1
PE	4575	I personaly tend to visit museums when I ' m in a new place because it ' s good for me know about the culture , tradition and history of other places . 	1
PE	4576	Many people like to visit museums when they travel to new places , other people don ' t like to visit museums . 	0
PE	4577	Reasons why travelers visit Museums ? 	0
PE	4578	However , other people visit museums are the most boring expirience of a trip . 	1
PE	4579	And that kind of knowledge speaks very highly of you . 	0
PE	4580	Visit museums can bring you the opportunity to establish relations and knowledge to participate in conversations . 	0
PE	4581	And also taking the chance for making friends . 	0
PE	4582	Admittedly , job can bring us happiness . 	1
PE	4583	In coclusion , the museums are a visual source to know the history , tradition and culture of any place in the world . 	1
PE	4584	My cousin Pedro literaly hates to visit museums but he really enjoyed his visit to the famous London - Madame Tussaud museum , it was kind of art entertainment but also that visit helped him to understand the artist works , and in addition he started to respect and admire other types of arts that offers in other museums . 	0
PE	4585	People can receive a sense of values and respected from job . 	0
PE	4586	If people receive respect from others , they will feel achievement and self-confidence . 	0
PE	4587	In addition , job can provide money to us . 	1
PE	4588	Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy . 	0
PE	4589	Firstly , a liberal policy is very feasible . 	0
PE	4590	However , to my mind students should be free not to attend classes because it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills . 	1
PE	4591	An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students . 	0
PE	4592	Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic . 	0
PE	4593	This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide . 	0
PE	4594	The issue at hand is whether it should be obligatory for university students to attend classes . 	0
PE	4595	Should students be required to attend classes ? 	0
PE	4596	So an optional attendance saves time and money . 	0
PE	4597	For example , Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl . 	0
PE	4598	Under suitable administration , tourism enhances local economic development 	0
PE	4599	Tourist trade is becoming a powerful engine for the economy . 	0
PE	4600	Nevertheless , some individuals believe that this position ignores the ecological and environmental destruction , as a result of tourist activities , and its adverse effects on local communities and ecosystems . 	0
PE	4601	While both positions seem reasonable , my view is that , through proper management and regulation , a booming tourist industry is an excellent source of economic growth and wealth for rural and urban areas . 	1
PE	4602	The most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region . 	1
PE	4603	This takes place , not only through direct expenditure from tourists , but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community , including retail , agriculture , and in the service industry . 	0
PE	4604	The increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation , luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid , well-regulated tourism programs . 	0
PE	4605	Furthermore , tourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community , including retail , hotels , transport , agriculture , and in the service industry . 	0
PE	4606	This increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes . 	0
PE	4607	As a result , this gives energy to the economic cycle , generating local economic prosperity in return . 	0
PE	4608	In addition , studying art and music is also the appropriate outlets of stress and superb ways to relax . 	1
PE	4609	Children managing their own money - best way to learn responsibility 	0
PE	4610	Not only do they contribute much to children ' s professional skills but also they can teach their students important social communication techniques in order to survive in this competitive world . 	1
PE	4611	In conclusion , technology has brought many benefits , but traditional skills and ways are always valuable and will last forever . 	1
PE	4612	If it was not for the space exploration , we would never know these facts . 	0
PE	4613	Some universities require students to study in one subject . 	0
PE	4614	On the contrary , others require students to study in several subjects . 	0
PE	4615	Why should human beings travel to outer space ? 	0
PE	4616	For many centuries , outer space has been one of the most favourable realms of study . 	0
PE	4617	Space expeditions have been launched and many have been successful . 	0
PE	4618	However , a lot of people still consider space exploration as an act of wasting money , to illustrate , astronauts only brought useless rocks back to planet earth despite the large sum of money spent on their equipment . 	0
PE	4619	On the other hand , there are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space . 	1
PE	4620	Universities require students to study many subjects or specialize in one subject 	0
PE	4621	For instance , a picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round , not flat . 	0
PE	4622	Another example is that it is the earth which goes around the sun , not vice versa . 	0
PE	4623	University is the place that provides people knowledge and skills to use in their real life . 	0
PE	4624	This is because they interested in many subjects and they want to try them all . 	0
PE	4625	For example , pupil who want to study science are also like to learn music . 	0
PE	4626	In my point of view , studying many subjects is better that one because students can study in subjects that they interested in , they can gain knowledge more than one field and they will have more chance to choose their future . 	1
PE	4627	First of all , when students finished their high schools , they are confused about subjects that they are going to choose to study in universities . 	0
PE	4628	However , I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment . 	1
PE	4629	In this view , the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting . 	1
PE	4630	As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources , advanced technologies and experience , they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards . 	0
PE	4631	Admittedly , some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection , thus ruining the local environments . 	0
PE	4632	As a result , unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen , which can put a strain on the natural resources . 	0
PE	4633	Besides , people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems . 	0
PE	4634	Currently , a great number of countries have pushed forward their economies by developing national industries . 	0
PE	4635	Economic development vs environment 	0
PE	4636	From my perspective , I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation . 	1
PE	4637	However , some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems . 	0
PE	4638	In addition , people who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one . 	1
PE	4639	Furthermore , this will encourage all the parents to think of the way to help their children to achieve more in their lives as they need to make some contribution too for their children future . 	1
PE	4640	In addition to that , the students will become more independent and it will build their characters in the marketplace as well . 	0
PE	4641	Primary and secondary education provide a basic knowledge and skills to the people in this world . 	0
PE	4642	Government and education 	0
PE	4643	Some parents might not have enough money to pay for their children university fees . 	1
PE	4644	I completely agree that government should provide those education to their people ; however , for the more higher education like university , the students or their parents should pay for the fees . 	1
PE	4645	It is better for them to use the money to pay for the other students ' education so that all people in their country could receive the same education . 	0
PE	4646	In the other hand , I don ' t think it is also fair for the government as the government has been paying a lot of money for their students ' primary and secondary education . 	1
PE	4647	They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves . 	1
PE	4648	Moreover , students that already have a basic knowledge and education can get a part-time job and they can pay for their own studies when their parent could not afford to pay it . 	0
PE	4649	For example , I worked in a large company , which has many different departments . 	0
PE	4650	First of all , when one knows different region ' s works , it will help one to get a friend much easier . 	1
PE	4651	The following will present my points . 	0
PE	4652	As far as I am concerned , having a large scale of different knowledge is the key to success . 	1
PE	4653	Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason . 	0
PE	4654	Some people believe that having a broad knowledge can give you a higher chance to success , while others think that professional in a specific subject is the key to enroll a success . 	0
PE	4655	Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject . 	0
PE	4656	Whether it is better to have broad knowledge or not 	0
PE	4657	What we do every day is to solve the problem that our clients asked in the phone . 	0
PE	4658	I was in the Management Information System department . 	0
PE	4659	At schools , students ' development has been orchestrated stage by stage , step by step by experienced teachers , and their acquisition of knowledge is guided and backed up in a systematic way . 	0
PE	4660	For instance , children who always studying hard and getting high achievement , it will be easy to pass qualification for work and they are more likely to find great work at multinational company . 	0
PE	4661	Therefore , formal education approaches are also indispensable . 	1
PE	4662	To put it all in a nutshell , I pen out saying that alternative sources information and traditional education systems are equally important in children ' s development . 	1
PE	4663	This strongly depicts the power of images in conveying messages , ideas , or opinions to people . 	0
PE	4664	Nevertheless , the importance of written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication that is commonly used . 	0
PE	4665	Is image more powerful than the written word ? 	0
PE	4666	" A picture is worth a thousand words " is a popular maxim that is being used for a very long time . 	0
PE	4667	For example , nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking . 	0
PE	4668	As a result , statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers , indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit . 	0
PE	4669	Hence , I agree only to certain degree that in today ' s world , image serves as a more effective means of communication . 	1
PE	4670	Firstly , pictures can influence the way people think . 	1
PE	4671	Not only that , the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter , which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan . 	0
PE	4672	Apart from that , images are also widely used in newspapers , magazines and advertisements . 	0
PE	4673	In conclusion , it is far better to protect our living environment rather than focus on job or work since the goal people is for good livers . 	1
PE	4674	In addition , cars increase the chance of employment because people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home . 	1
PE	4675	Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship . 	0
PE	4676	My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money . 	0
PE	4677	Furthermore , they are more flexible . 	0
PE	4678	If he had no car , he wouldn ' t be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms . 	0
PE	4679	He used his car to drive to the other end of the country , worked there during the week and came home for the weekend . 	0
PE	4680	If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life . 	0
PE	4681	Finally , the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world . 	0
PE	4682	There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car . 	0
PE	4683	They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas . 	0
PE	4684	When the students go to university , they have matured mentally and physically . 	1
PE	4685	In a nutshell , although few brilliant lecturers deliver more informative lectures , some are boring the students in the class and wasting the students ' time . 	1
PE	4686	Therefore , to make use of time , if the students choose the classes as optional , it would provide more benefits than drawbacks . 	1
PE	4687	They have enough knowledge to choose what they need to do . 	1
PE	4688	In conclusion , taking the part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it . 	1
PE	4689	Therefore , parents should encourage students to take the part-time job . 	1
PE	4690	It goes without saying that no pupil can succeed at school unassisted . 	0
PE	4691	Classmates ' impacts on children ' s performance at school 	0
PE	4692	It is argued that parents who are the closet to children mainly contribute to their accomplishments . 	0
PE	4693	Their success should be attributed to many different external factors . 	0
PE	4694	To begin with , the classmates themselves creat a competitive atmoshphere which incent the children . 	1
PE	4695	However , in my opinion , the classmates should be regarded as the most important influence on individual achievements . 	1
PE	4696	From a psychological perspective , the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exert enormous pressure on the children , which subsequently transforms into some sort of stimulants and boosts the children ' s academic performances . 	0
PE	4697	In high school , for instance , an individual cannot resist studying painstakingly through day and night when the others who are astoundingly ambitious and set sights on prestigious universities around the globe are doing the same . 	0
PE	4698	It is a matter of fact that students share even more time together than with their parents , explaining a great deal of wisdom they absorb from each others ; it can be , for example , lessons on the class , social skills or general etiquettes that are sometimes overlooked by parents . 	0
PE	4699	To add up , when it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such , classmates are second to none . 	1
PE	4700	They not only free to do whatever they want without any confine or punishment , but also they are free and have a lot of time in their hands to try and experience new things and enjoy them . 	1
PE	4701	All in all , I would maintain that the best phase of people life is their childhood . 	1
PE	4702	Have you ever traveled along to support your home football team during tournaments ? 	0
PE	4703	Live football game at a stadium 	0
PE	4704	If you have a great love with football and your home team , it is much more gratifying to stay side by side and cheer up the team at the stadium rather than just to stay at home and watch the match alone . 	1
PE	4705	Have you attended at a stadium to watch your team ' s match , yell or even cry with the team and their thousands of fans there ? 	0
PE	4706	Before the match starts , thousands of fans gathering outside of the stadium with team flags , colorful outfits , sound of trumpets and rattles . . . everywhere . 	0
PE	4707	First , attending a live football match is very fulfilling . 	1
PE	4708	You are watching football stars play the game with your own eyes and sharing your feelings with about 40 , 000 people at the stadium , such an excitement you can never have when you are watching it at home . 	0
PE	4709	As the game kicks off , the atmosphere inside the stadium is even more exciting . 	0
PE	4710	See , you will be bored if you are watching it alone . 	0
PE	4711	Everybody yells and sings together , the stadium is like bursted out whenever a goal is scored . 	0
PE	4712	Imagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws . 	1
PE	4713	Mind can not work when it is chained in boundaries . 	1
PE	4714	I firmly believe that artists should be given the freedom of expression . 	1
PE	4715	Being a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you . 	0
PE	4716	Another great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day . 	0
PE	4717	I agree with the statement that childhood is the happiest period of one ' s life . 	1
PE	4718	Childhood is the happiest time of a person ' s life 	0
PE	4719	Starting with our adulthood , we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives . 	0
PE	4720	It ' s not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives , but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think . 	1
PE	4721	Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community . 	0
PE	4722	So , relating well to people is also another important factor . 	1
PE	4723	Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren ' t supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult . 	0
PE	4724	But during our childhood , though responsibilies exist , we are much more free to do what we would like to . 	1
PE	4725	Many students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world . 	0
PE	4726	Mitigating process , no interaction and pressure are these things people should examine when they want to work at home . 	1
PE	4727	Researches into humanities and art still need large amount of money , what ' s more , government ' s big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide . 	1
PE	4728	From reasons listed above , we can safely draw the conclusion that , a government should spare effort on young children education as well as universities , both are crucial on the way to a brighter future . 	1
PE	4729	An illustration of this unfortunate trend can be seen almost everywhere these days , wherein most teens at an early age own phones which are worth twice the salary of their parents . 	0
PE	4730	Furthermore , most of these juveniles are students so they would need their parents to support them financially for what they want . 	0
PE	4731	Relatively , these do not come at a significant and inexpensive cost . 	0
PE	4732	They would not only purchase a phone because of its functionality but also for its brand . 	0
PE	4733	Therefore , I highly discourage the young ones to be overly dependent on mobile phones . 	0
PE	4734	This clearly shows that the negative impacts brought about by mobile phones are harmful to a person ’ s education and character . 	1
PE	4735	I believe parents can lead their children to a more smooth career path . 	1
PE	4736	In considering whether one should choose a job similar to his or her parents ' , I have mentioned a few reasons that one can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry . 	1
PE	4737	As we all know life saving oxygen is produced by trees after converting harmful carbon dioxide gas . 	0
PE	4738	Moreover , wild life is very essential to maintain ecological balance on planet Earth . 	0
PE	4739	Firstly , rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world . 	1
PE	4740	The so-called Concrete jungles have evolved endangering forests and wild life . 	0
PE	4741	There has been a lot of initiatives to protect the planet Earth from unbridled human developments . 	0
PE	4742	Although some people argue these developments are making our life comfortable , but concerns to save Earth are vital due to various reasons . 	1
PE	4743	For example , every other day , new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others . 	0
PE	4744	Competition helps in improvement and evolution . 	1
PE	4745	Competition has helped the development of science and technology . 	0
PE	4746	An individual must compete with oneself only , instead of trying to beat others . 	0
PE	4747	Unfortunately , the meaning of competiton has been modified in a wrong direction . 	0
PE	4748	However , competition is also as important as co-operation . 	0
PE	4749	A co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people ' s achievements . 	0
PE	4750	It helps to identify one ' s strengths and weaknesses as compared to others . 	0
PE	4751	Nevertheless , co-operation helps to understand other ' s perspective and learn by their mistakes . 	1
PE	4752	In the same way , co-operative approach will save time , energy and will have a higher success rate . 	0
PE	4753	Although technologies allowed us to have a convenient life , it has made our lives more chaotic according to the reasons mentioned above . 	1
PE	4754	Furthermore , jobs has various responsibilities like attendance , sometimes extra work and so on . 	0
PE	4755	This would result in stress , tension and tiredness . 	0
PE	4756	It divert their mind from studies and would take away their childhood phase from their life . 	1
PE	4757	A student has to do lots of studies in today ' s competitive world to prove himself . 	0
PE	4758	He has to spend his most of time in school to get a good grades . 	0
PE	4759	If the student get involved himself in job in rest of the time , then it would cause an extra burden on them . 	1
PE	4760	Do you think it is good for teenagers to work while schooling ? 	0
PE	4761	In my opinion , it is not the good idea for teenagers to have job while they are still students . 	1
PE	4762	Although , many argue that it provide good working experience , but I think it can interfere with their life in various ways . 	1
PE	4763	Having jobs would affect the health of the student . 	1
PE	4764	The repercussion are so severe that their families and friends remain deprived off their attention and in the end they end up losing balance between their family and personal life . 	0
PE	4765	Secondly , these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign . 	1
PE	4766	As they usually remain busy in their office so they do not find leisure time for such social activities . 	0
PE	4767	For instance , I would take my boss ' s example ; he has been working for extended hours in office for many years . 	0
PE	4768	Recently , his health and personal life was drastically affected as he broke up with his wife and his family life has totally been in chaos and cries . 	0
PE	4769	He started regretting afterwards and now trying to manage his work but it seems to be too late for him . 	0
PE	4770	To conclude this , I would strongly emphasis and recommend , Government must include the clause of maximum number of working hours in its Labor Law and enforce to all companies for ensuring their employees do not spend extended hours in companies . 	1
PE	4771	This will help in uplift of society , and bring the lost equilibrium between personal and professional life of each individual person . 	1
PE	4772	In a nutshell , the advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable . 	1
PE	4773	I am usually inclined to this idea and I hope that the government will regard the investment in building roads as the most important thing . 	0
PE	4774	To sum up , everything has its own gains and losses and advertisement is not an exception . 	0
PE	4775	From my point of view , advertising will be better if producers and advertisers are more honest in producing advertisements to give people the general view on one product . 	0
PE	4776	No wonder why this drinking title becomes more and more familiar with customers around the world . 	0
PE	4777	Last but not least , online advertisement is one of the easiest approaches due to their potential gains such as cheaper cost , convenience and easily observing . 	0
PE	4778	Establishing a new university in your community 	0
PE	4779	I will be happy to hear that the government has a plan to build a new university in my community . 	1
PE	4780	There are many advantages setting up the university such as more opportunities to people in the community to pursue their studies , creation of jobs . 	1
PE	4781	However , they come together with some disadvantages such as social problems . 	0
PE	4782	Undoubtedly , the university will have to hire professors , employees and etc . Thus , a number vacant positions need to be filled . 	0
PE	4783	Also there will be more opportunities to work in the community . 	0
PE	4784	Some people who hold different viewpoints may advocate that protecting traditions consume too much financial budget compared with the incoming it takes . 	1
PE	4785	In spite of the fact this kind of business bring limited contribution to government finance , it should be emphasized that the expense is trivial compared with the potential value of traditions . 	0
PE	4786	Therefore the government authorities and education institutes should work closely together to promote the traditional skills and ways of life , so as to make people to realize the value of them . 	1
PE	4787	All in all , protection of tradition is not only important for the entire society currently , but also contributes to the next generation . 	1
PE	4788	This helps readers to get updated and act accordingly . 	0
PE	4789	For example , when the aircraft MH 370 went missing , everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident . 	0
PE	4790	The importance of games for adults comparing to children 	0
PE	4791	As people grow up , the arguments about the importance of games arise . 	0
PE	4792	But , more often , the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies , and as a result , they cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago . 	0
PE	4793	For example , in my country , except for a minor part of professional athletes , the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job . 	0
PE	4794	The first reason is that games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin . 	1
PE	4795	Someone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life . 	0
PE	4796	Internet will end the era of newspapers and magazines 	0
PE	4797	Digital media has been extremely popular among people around the globe . 	0
PE	4798	With this advancement , newspapers and magazines are struggling to justify their existence . 	0
PE	4799	Some believe that traditional paper media will come to an end very soon due to the increased usage of internet based media . 	0
PE	4800	But many other still thinks they are going to stay . 	0
PE	4801	I agree to the argument that newspapers and magazines will be history with the time . 	1
PE	4802	I will establish my view by analysing how internet presents the information about the current affair so fast and the accessibility to the historical news . 	1
PE	4803	A very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis . 	0
PE	4804	The main disadvantage is contamination . 	1
PE	4805	For example , the estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers ' accommodation need . 	0
PE	4806	First of all , a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate . 	1
PE	4807	From my point of view , the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages , if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories . 	1
PE	4808	Finally , all professors in the university are fortune of the society . 	0
PE	4809	That is good for both of the professor and students . 	0
PE	4810	Without their research , there will be no new technologies come out quickly . 	1
PE	4811	They are the leaders almost in every fields of science , arts , culture and so on . 	0
PE	4812	If a professor doesn ' t get any researching works , he cannot give us the opportunity . 	1
PE	4813	There are three reasons that can explain their unresponsiveness to the modern workplace . 	0
PE	4814	But we can only turn to our professors when we want to take part in a research and to get ourselves promoted . 	0
PE	4815	He or she may stimulate us students to come up with some creative sugesstions . 	0
PE	4816	In addition , a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time . 	1
PE	4817	This is still true in the industrial society nowadays , where younger workers are preferably employed and promoted rather than over-50 workers . 	0
PE	4818	If you show in your workplace that you are the one who can work more than other even carelessly , your boss will assign you more tasks . 	0
PE	4819	If you do them fast too , the first acknowledgement of your boss encourages you to work harder . 	0
PE	4820	The more money , the more chances . 	0
PE	4821	Last but not least , people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks . 	1
PE	4822	This fact pushes them to work faster and faster . 	0
PE	4823	For example , because applying to study abroad needs a lot of money , I am working in two organization to gain more salary . 	0
PE	4824	Most importantly , people prone to work in two or three firms in a week because the expenses have been increased . 	1
PE	4825	If they work just in one organization they cannot earn enough money . 	0
PE	4826	He has been threatened by his boss who was going to fire him . 	0
PE	4827	My friend went to a course where he learned how should work rapidly and now he is working . 	0
PE	4828	Co-education helps both genders to gel well with each other . 	0
PE	4829	It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together . 	0
PE	4830	Should universities accept equal number of males / females or not 	0
PE	4831	Education is important for the development of the world . 	0
PE	4832	Its a debatable issue whether universities should accept equal number of males and females in a course or not . 	0
PE	4833	However , since both genders are equally important , both must be given equal opportunities . 	0
PE	4834	Universities must admit both in equal numbers , depending on their choices . 	1
PE	4835	Right to education is a basic human right of both , males and females . 	0
PE	4836	The whole world aims for women empowerment , and to achieve this , females should be given equal opportunities as males . 	1
PE	4837	When universities will accept them in equal number , both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop . 	0
PE	4838	I think the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively . 	0
PE	4839	By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment . 	0
PE	4840	A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer . 	0
PE	4841	Thus , students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning . 	0
PE	4842	That is to say , students have a better environment to working on their assignments so the quality of their assignments will improve . 	0
PE	4843	For example , most would rather choose to piece together parts of a machine than have it done by a robot for their disbelief of its efficiency and safety compared with human ' s capability . 	0
PE	4844	In my school , the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby . 	0
PE	4845	For me , I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment . 	0
PE	4846	It ' s unpleasant to stay at school . 	0
PE	4847	However , coffee shops are not always quiet , so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly . 	0
PE	4848	Hence , even though freedom to express ideas can bring some negative effects , I certainly believe that there are many wonderful and beautiful Arts due to the freedom to express ideas and thus , I strongly believe there should be no restrictions on them . 	1
PE	4849	I connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget , even though now I ' m not studying chemistry anymore . 	0
PE	4850	Second , by bridging the theories with daily life events , students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem-solving . 	1
PE	4851	However , on the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition , saying that universities provide not only skills for careers , but also academic knowledge for the human race , such as bio science , politics , and medicine . 	1
PE	4852	These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world . 	0
PE	4853	To begin with , those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons . 	0
PE	4854	From their point of view , the fact is that there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation , such as mechanics , sales persons , or engineers , and , furthermore , labors for graduates are in short supply . 	0
PE	4855	What is worse , the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying . 	0
PE	4856	In this regard it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs , even can be a sheer time-consuming . 	1
PE	4857	Young people should go to university or not 	0
PE	4858	Persistent deliberation is happening as to whether it is desirable for the youth to go to university . 	0
PE	4859	In regard to the development of the country , some people believe that it is essential for young students to get high quality of education in universities , while others think that it is only one of causes to increase the rate of unemployment . 	0
PE	4860	In this essay , I will analyze both views first in order to come up with a fool-proof decision . 	0
PE	4861	That ' s why education in university is discussed all the time . 	0
PE	4862	What is the best way to orientate the students ? 	0
PE	4863	I ' m against providing more money to professors 	0
PE	4864	The misery is so ingrained in their mind that they refuse to change , or more precisely , to accept the existence of such modernity . 	0
PE	4865	The professors are essential , however , the schools are established for students . 	1
PE	4866	Money should spend on facilities in school or update resources , which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors . 	1
PE	4867	Raising the salaries of professors so ? 	0
PE	4868	I would say no . 	0
PE	4869	The following are my opinions . 	0
PE	4870	To begin with , the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors . 	1
PE	4871	The old were raised in poverty , probably caused by war , look at the world from a negative and pessimistic point of view . 	0
PE	4872	First and foremost , old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm . 	1
PE	4873	This may help those who are in the process of panning a criminal act perfect their plans , avoid the pitfalls and make themselves harder to be tracked down by the police . 	0
PE	4874	An even more detrimental fact is that detailed reports of crimes exposured on the press may provide the potential criminals with instructive learning materials , which would be hard to obtain otherwise . 	0
PE	4875	Hence , staying longer with parents is a better choice . 	1
PE	4876	Furthermore , temporarily targets should be set , with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time , for example , a season . 	0
PE	4877	Primarily , authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities , such as constructing more bus lines , in order to reducing the usage of private cars . 	0
PE	4878	Meanwhile , cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out , though it might not be into effect immediately , but in the long run , it would be a wise choice . 	0
PE	4879	Plus with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems . 	0
PE	4880	In conclusion , addressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price is not adequate , while improving transportation facilities and building supervisory institution would be preferable , plus with the awareness of environmental protection being raised . 	1
PE	4881	In conclusion , I admit that modern technology has provided a more convenient and comfortable manner for people to watch exhibitions , but museums and art galleries are necessary to be preserved for its importance of education and culture . 	1
PE	4882	Underdeveloped nations no doubt receive direct benefits through such deeds . 	0
PE	4883	Thus , without the prevention on criminal details , the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken . 	1
PE	4884	For instance , there many game applications available online and many of them are quite aggressive in nature . 	0
PE	4885	Furthermore , the growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development . 	1
PE	4886	For example , as people , especially teenagers increasingly tend to focus on their phones , they may lose their interests on daily activities such as meeting with friends , and this lack of communication may impair their future negotiation and interpersonal skills . 	0
PE	4887	In the first place , spending too much time on mobiles phones many exert an adverse effect on our social skills . 	0
PE	4888	As a result , it is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently . 	1
PE	4889	Moreover , continuous use of mobile phones may also damage children ' s eyesight and physical posture . 	0
PE	4890	Recently , there has been a social concern with regard to whether or not mobiles phones have negative effects on our social life . 	0
PE	4891	Mobile phones : faster communication vs social problems 	0
PE	4892	However , I believe , this great invention in the 21st century causes many problems in our society . 	1
PE	4893	Indeed , mobile phones have widely been used by people of all ages . 	0
PE	4894	Having one ' s own hobbies and doing physical activities can bring us a lot of benefits . 	1
PE	4895	First , having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit . 	1
PE	4896	Looking at the computer screen all day long can make us daze , so doing some sport and hobbies can prevent us from becoming too fat or short-sighted . 	0
PE	4897	My neighbor Tom once was a computer engineer in a big company . 	0
PE	4898	People should have hobbies and do physical activities 	0
PE	4899	Whether or not people should have hobbies and do physical activities has been a controversial question . 	0
PE	4900	Different people have different ideas . 	0
PE	4901	Some people think we should focus on our jobs , but I don ' t agree with them . 	0
PE	4902	He ate fast food everyday and never went out to exercise . 	0
PE	4903	When he found out that he was too fat to find a girlfriend , he made up his mind to loose weight . 	0
PE	4904	Thirdly , the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide . 	1
PE	4905	What is worse , some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police , which makes citizens always live in danger . 	0
PE	4906	Take an example , in American , young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns , which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting . 	0
PE	4907	Eventually , guns will create a violent society if the trend continues . 	0
PE	4908	To conclude , both options have their advantages , but personally I think the advantages of living in an apartment outshine those of living in a dormitory . 	1
PE	4909	Unfortunately , there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over . 	0
PE	4910	In the US , firearms remain the most common method of suicide , accounting for about 50 per cent . 	0
PE	4911	Hence I support this point that the learning with a teacher is better . 	1
PE	4912	Notable one of the shortcomings is that if someone faced so complicated confusion in his study and his many endeavors on making out it were miscarried , this might be ended in disappointment . 	0
PE	4913	I think that for one who depends on only himself in learning , his improvement of ability , with regard to cooperation and express his opinion , is unpromising . 	0
PE	4914	knowledge may be thereby better improved and strengthened . 	0
PE	4915	Finally , of course , being without a teacher has shortcomings . 	1
PE	4916	Furthermore , the teachers play important role in leading us to right direction . 	0
PE	4917	Moreover , This gives us opportunity to rise our educational level to an exited degree . 	0
PE	4918	Secondly , in my mind , the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself . 	1
PE	4919	We can accomplish our assignments with little help of a teacher within less time than do it by ourself . 	0
PE	4920	Admittedly , there are a few students paying considerable time on the computer games playing finally choose computer games related jobs as their career . 	1
PE	4921	However , those subjects are not suitable for the students and will bring bad effects to the youths . 	0
PE	4922	Since all these games are developed for commercial purpose and in order to catch the eyes of the children , majority of the games use war , violence , bloody , or sexual subjects to lure the students . 	0
PE	4923	Second , children could learn nothing from these computer games , therefore time on this activity is really time wasting . 	1
PE	4924	Recent research by Scientist also reveals that the youngs are more likely to be attacted by and lose themselves in these computer games , because of their low control ability . 	0
PE	4925	An investigation done by Beijing University shows that 80% of the students who failed in the final exam paid 2 hours or more on-online games every week , while 90% excellent students expressed that they did not touch computer games during the most of the days . 	0
PE	4926	First and foremost , a large number of students are obsessed in on-line computer games and as a result their performance in school are declined . 	1
PE	4927	I hold a positive view against this opinion . 	0
PE	4928	It is a debatable subject that children should not be allowed to play computer games since playing computer games is a a waste of time . 	1
PE	4929	Disagree Playing Computer Games wastes time and students should not be allowed ! 	0
PE	4930	Last , we should develop at least one personal hobby , not to show off , but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured . 	1
PE	4931	Playing musical instrument is a good way , I can play classical guitar . 	0
PE	4932	Humans are not robots ; we can ' t keep working for twenty-four hours . 	0
PE	4933	Doing sports or hobbies for a short time can recharge our batteries . 	0
PE	4934	Also , doing something for a long time can be boring , having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind . 	1
PE	4935	For example , at school , students have breaks every class so that they can relax for a few minutes and prepare for the next class . 	0
PE	4936	He started to jog every morning . 	0
PE	4937	After a moth , he is thinner and finds a girlfriend . 	0
PE	4938	When I meet difficulties in studies , I will take my guitar and play the song Green Sleeves . 	0
PE	4939	It makes me feel better and gives me the confidence . 	0
PE	4940	In conclusion , I completely agree that government should not pay for the university fees because this will make both the parents and students in charge for their future themselves not just depend on the government to do all their responsibilities for them . 	1
PE	4941	Secondly , the centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve . 	1
PE	4942	Especially , if they have no knowledge or education in this field . 	0
PE	4943	If a university plans to develop a new research in my country and I have to choose between establishing a centre for business research or a centre for agriculture research , I would opt for the second one . 	1
PE	4944	These researches can be aimed for several fields such as business or agriculture . 	0
PE	4945	Most of the universities in the world seek to develop some research in some countries . 	0
PE	4946	A university plans to devlope a new research centre in your country 	0
PE	4947	This centre can also help people there to solve their issues related to their land . 	1
PE	4948	The centre for research in agriculture can help my co-citizens to better exploit these land . 	1
PE	4949	Most of these lands are left without any treatment . 	0
PE	4950	First of all , my country has a lot of land which is useful for the agriculture . 	0
PE	4951	After a while the situation became clear , but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia . 	0
PE	4952	For example , Russian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia , however , european news announced that it was initiated by Russia . 	0
PE	4953	Nowadays information plays an important role in our world . 	0
PE	4954	Gossip-based information 	0
PE	4955	Some people say : " information is power " . 	1
PE	4956	It has become a product , which can be sold , bought , or stolen . 	0
PE	4957	I consider the statement above to be right for several reasons . 	0
PE	4958	That ' s why it is so important to be well-informed . 	0
PE	4959	Some people may disinform you on purpose , that ' s why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information . 	0
PE	4960	The first reason is that by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability . 	1
PE	4961	For example , in a survey carried out in a university , it was asked to students that why did they start smoking , then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes . 	0
PE	4962	Many young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age . 	0
PE	4963	First of all , it is seen that following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents . 	1
PE	4964	This will be proven by looking at how health and personality of young people is affected by following celebrities as their mentors . 	0
PE	4965	It is agreed that following celebrities can be dangerous for the youth . 	1
PE	4966	These celebrities are popular among younger generations because of their glamorous lifestyles . 	0
PE	4967	Young people all over the world are greatly influenced by media and celebrities . 	0
PE	4968	Effect of celebrities on youth 	0
PE	4969	In conclusion , given the reasons described above , when the advantages and disadvantages of whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years or not are carefully compared , the best choice is obviously stand on my side , which is that the car use will definitely decrease in twenty years . 	1
PE	4970	Secondly , it is believed that when youth follows celebrities it affects personality of young people in a bad way . 	0
PE	4971	This example makes it clear that imitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals . 	0
PE	4972	Everyone that has strongly ambition could pursue and success their goal even they are not classified as a good student because people can change . 	0
PE	4973	With a good environment in college or university is encouraging students to study harder for a good future . 	0
PE	4974	On the other hand , there are some people think that all students should have equal opportunity to study in higher education . 	0
PE	4975	Of course , higher education take a lot of money and a lot of time however moderate students should have a chance to try . 	0
PE	4976	Students can have opportunity to learn , to practice , to gain more knowledge for their career and for their future . 	1
PE	4977	Studying in college and university is a great opportunity that all students should have . 	1
PE	4978	Thus , mediocre students should have opportunity to be trained in college and university . 	1
PE	4979	In conclusion , I personally agree with that college and university should be available for all students who want to pursue their goal . 	1
PE	4980	For instance , in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products because they have employees whose performance are very high . 	0
PE	4981	Consequently , When school gather teachers that have great performance , school are gaining higher quality . 	0
PE	4982	Teachers could augment their quality . 	0
PE	4983	Additionally , this evaluation from students could improve schools ' quality . 	1
PE	4984	Because teachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects , students could comprehend their subject easily . 	0
PE	4985	Students could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance . 	0
PE	4986	Finally , people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students . 	1
PE	4987	Schools could produce intellectual students because school have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students . 	0
PE	4988	In conclusion , I agree with this statement that school should ask students to evaluate their teachers because teachers could improve their performance . 	1
PE	4989	As a result , students , who study from great schools which have great performance teacher , graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life . 	0
PE	4990	So students should learn both from their teachers as well as modern technology to gain the best learning outcome . 	0
PE	4991	Since it is a classroom or campus projects , there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas . 	0
PE	4992	While we should realize that in a project , there are numerous coordination works are required , if each opinion is communicated via email , there will be hundreds or thousands of emails there that we know this is not a good experience . 	1
PE	4993	In conclusion , I prefer the project members to work in person rather them by email because work in person will be more efficient . 	1
PE	4994	While if the same words are expressed in talking , the counterparty will feel more relaxed since their response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim . 	0
PE	4995	Therefore , less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights , and enhance the communication amongst the team members . 	1
PE	4996	Admittedly , sometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place . 	0
PE	4997	Although emails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none . 	1
PE	4998	However , there are also disadvantages . 	0
PE	4999	A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental . 	1
PE	5000	When students work during these breaks , the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia . 	0
PE	5001	For instance , my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted . 	0
PE	5002	Working or traveling for some time , after high school , can help them to find their field of interest . 	1
PE	5003	It will also help them to learn professional setup by working . 	0
PE	5004	Financially , students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job . 	0
PE	5005	Some students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course . 	0
PE	5006	When he started his university studies , he failed miserably . 	0
PE	5007	Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time . 	0
PE	5008	First and foremost , sports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another so that they can improve their results , break records and bring victories to their own countries . 	1
PE	5009	Because a large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events , there are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures . 	0
PE	5010	Consequently , sport events with the spirit of healthiness , honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding , friendship and solidarity among nations . 	1
PE	5011	After sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition , the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners , which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations . 	0
PE	5012	Secondly , sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators . 	0
PE	5013	When individuals keep the habit of grasping the world ' s cutting-edge fashion information , they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world , which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world . 	0
PE	5014	This is because following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world ' s latest transformations , which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today . 	1
PE	5015	As a result , they might fall behind shortly . 	0
PE	5016	In contrast , if they stuck to their own fashion styles , disregarding the world ' s top fashion designers ' achievements , they would stay conservative in their own worlds . 	0
PE	5017	With increasing availability to the Internet , people can collect a wealth of information about the latest fashion trends over the world , such as the most popular shoes style this season or the best-liked clothes color this year . 	0
PE	5018	should one follow fashion trends rather than a personal style ? 	0
PE	5019	From my perspective , fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people ' s lives than personal dressing styles . 	1
PE	5020	However , some people think that dressing in a personal style should be advocated rather than following fashion trends . 	0
PE	5021	Without following fashion trends , such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes , let alone forming their own dressing styles . 	1
PE	5022	Furthermore , people with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information . 	0
PE	5023	On the other hand , living off campus prepares students for the real life . 	1
PE	5024	For example , students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible , independent , punctual , co-operative compared to living in university dormitories . 	0
PE	5025	In conclusion , given the reasons described above , when the advantages and disadvantages of whether having the knowledge in different fields is better or not are carefully compared . 	0
PE	5026	The best choice is obviously stand on my side , which is that a broad knowledge of different subjects is really important . 	1
PE	5027	However , what if one finally find out him or her has the talent in other filed . 	0
PE	5028	In this way , it won ’ t be a problem at all . 	0
PE	5029	People who hold different opinion may argue that if one can ’ t success one ’ s own major , what else things he can do in different filed . 	1
PE	5030	Of course , it may be true when talking about this topic . 	0
PE	5031	In addition , it is easier for students to get help when facing problem such as if students have problem in solving their math question , they can easily ask for help to their roommates , classmates , or teachers . 	0
PE	5032	I think living in dormitory is always helpful to students . 	1
PE	5033	That ' s the main reason I against providing more money to professors . 	1
PE	5034	Students are those who suppose to enjoy the use of their tuition . 	0
PE	5035	At school , students are priority . 	0
PE	5036	Students ' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university . 	1
PE	5037	And when they are in primary school , teachers teach them more further knowledge , like writing skills and using computers . 	0
PE	5038	They argue that teachers teach students how to write , read and calculate since they are in kindergarten . 	0
PE	5039	Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers . 	1
PE	5040	Now , many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful . 	0
PE	5041	They all enrich our daily lives . 	0
PE	5042	There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives , such as the Internet , television and cell phone . 	0
PE	5043	Over the last half century the change in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations . 	0
PE	5044	Lessons with teachers versus others sources 	0
PE	5045	On the other hand , students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers . 	0
PE	5046	It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling . 	0
PE	5047	In conclusion , a professor should do their research all the time during their careers as a teacher in university . 	1
PE	5048	And it ' s worth to spend more time on it than on teaching . 	0
PE	5049	However , some people point that technology has made children less creative . 	0
PE	5050	I don ' t deny that technology may have some negative effects on children , but I think technology makes children even more creative . 	1
PE	5051	First , technology inspires children to create new things . 	0
PE	5052	Children are curious about everything around them , so when they come across a high-tech product like a cellphone , they will be obsessed with its mysterious functions and eager to know how it works . 	0
PE	5053	Technology inspires children ' s creativity instead of weakening it 	0
PE	5054	Technology accelerates human ' s evolving pace . 	0
PE	5055	With advanced technology , many things that seemed impossible in the past , have become realities . 	0
PE	5056	For example , people in the past never dreamed of talking to anyone whenever they wanted or see someone overseas on a computer screen , both of these can be achieved with cellphone and internet . 	0
PE	5057	For example , Bill Gates was attracted by the original huge computer , then he did everything he could to understand how it worked . 	0
PE	5058	After he had figured out all the stuff , he then began to promote the computer . 	0
PE	5059	By doing this , outdoors relationships may expand and it may accompany with sexual relationship and as result , their thoughts deviate from the studies . 	0
PE	5060	By contrast , some experts believe that attending both girls and boys in a same school cause many disadvantages for them . 	0
PE	5061	Women or men almost need each other in full of life even in school . 	0
PE	5062	Attending boys and girls in a same school would bring many advantages 	0
PE	5063	In my opinion , boys and girls should study together in the sense that they have a chance to know each other and learn how to behave with an opposite sex . 	1
PE	5064	Although some experts believe that common schools for both female and male lead to diminish their efficiency in education , others view it as a helpful way to recognize the opposite gender . 	0
PE	5065	By attending to the same school , students can learn how to view the opposite gender in classes as a friend or a classmate . 	1
PE	5066	School is a small society for students , which prepares them for the future life . 	0
PE	5067	They would know how to ask her in order to cooperate with his study , how communicate with girls in a group , etc . Admittedly , when they study together and help each other , they exercise the the real life as they age . 	0
PE	5068	In addition , a boy would know how to speak with a girl in every situation and vice versa . 	0
PE	5069	Study achievements depend on a range of various factors , one of which is pattern of work you tend to choose while studying . 	0
PE	5070	Type of temper and advantages of individual work as best arguments in favor of studying alone 	0
PE	5071	As for me , I favor the latter because of the following reasons . 	0
PE	5072	In particular , we may prefer to work either within a team of other students or alone . 	0
PE	5073	Being by nature introvert , I have to spend much time and efforts on adjusting to surroundings and especially new people . 	0
PE	5074	To begin with , type of temper is one of the reasons that make me to choose individual work instead of team one . 	0
PE	5075	Therefore , my productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper . 	1
PE	5076	Once , when I was working on presentation with strangers , I sat aside and so prepared more than half of work myself instead of making attempts to get acquainted with unknown people . 	0
PE	5077	In other words , I must not divide tasks and duties between team members , share responsibility and benefits , and spend time on teambuilding . 	0
PE	5078	Furthermore / moreover , working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork . 	1
PE	5079	Not to mention , that hasty decisions , not only goes to waste , but also , could affect the entire life of the person . 	1
PE	5080	To put it differently , is that after this person has quit his job and became unemployed , he can no longer pay his bills nor buy what he needs for his everyday needs , thus , his life had taken a turn to the worst . 	0
PE	5081	For example : if someone decided to quit his job without really thinking about the alternative , or a plan B , he could end up being unemployed , because of his speedy decision . 	0
PE	5082	In addition , making a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity . 	1
PE	5083	In another word , if this person had waited and thought his decision through he wouldn ' t have missed out on the job opening in the same firm , but at a different position . 	0
PE	5084	Hence , he wouldn ' t have been unemployed . 	0
PE	5085	Haste makes waste 	0
PE	5086	This saying is stating that every fast and not well thought decision is a wasted one . 	1
PE	5087	In my opinion , this statement is completely true , for these few reasons : For one thing , making a quick decision means that it ' s not very thought out , and that it hasn ' t been checked from all its aspects . 	0
PE	5088	Consequently , making quick decisions leads to probable bad results . 	1
PE	5089	In my opinion , one of the main reasons for supporting this statement is that successful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things . 	1
PE	5090	According to a statistic conducted by the International Animal Preserving Association , we have only ten percent of the animals that have ever existed , which means that the biodiversity of our home is grievously endangered . 	0
PE	5091	First , conservation is more urgent now than at any time in history . 	1
PE	5092	If I had the opportunity to help a company make a decision on spending money either on supporting the arts or helping the environment , I would choose the latter without hesitation for the reasons below . 	0
PE	5093	Spending money on supporting art or protecting environment 	0
PE	5094	Furthermore , supporting environment protection will benefit the company eventually . 	1
PE	5095	In short , the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever and if we didn ' t take harsh measures now , we never will . 	0
PE	5096	If we continue discharging carbon dioxide with non-environmentally friendly cars , nations like Japan will be submerged and weather patterns could change , causing flooding , drought , and an increasing amount of damaging storms . 	0
PE	5097	What ' s more , rising sea levels , caused by global warming , have reached a level that is threatening human ' s life in many countries . 	0
PE	5098	Just imagine if the project your company is sponsoring effectively improves the environment , then your company would be known as an environmentally-friendly company and benefit from it in this consumer-oriented society . 	0
PE	5099	Nowadays , an increasing amount of people pay more attention to conservation ; therefore , sponsoring conservation is a more efficient method of advertising . 	0
PE	5100	However , it would be indispensable that the government conduct a survey about the community opinion on the new university first . 	0
PE	5101	I believe the benefit from it will outweigh the cost . 	1
PE	5102	These people depend solely on hard work and luck . 	0
PE	5103	Take for instance those who start their own business . 	0
PE	5104	To cite an example , Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19 . 	0
PE	5105	Interestingly , for some of them it proved to be a profitable job . 	0
PE	5106	Eventually , he used his earnings as well as his family ' s loan in order to progress to be who he is now . 	0
PE	5107	Initially , he started his computer company in his college dorm room . 	0
PE	5108	This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports . 	0
PE	5109	In addition , people with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life . 	0
PE	5110	To illustrate this further , David Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many . 	0
PE	5111	The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph . 	0
PE	5112	Also I got familiar with different kind of animals and plants in this age . 	0
PE	5113	As a matter of fact , I made a large number of friends in this age , and I almost traveled to all cities of my county when I was in kindergarten . 	0
PE	5114	If we lived in good environment , our life would be better . 	0
PE	5115	In addition to controlling emission carbon dioxide , government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy . 	1
PE	5116	Second , environment is also important issue that everyone depend on it . 	0
PE	5117	Thus , people have a good quality life . 	0
PE	5118	Therefore , criminal rate were drop . 	0
PE	5119	When people have jobs , they did not have to steal money . 	0
PE	5120	So , government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide . 	0
PE	5121	These impact on every living creature in the world . 	0
PE	5122	Greenhouse effect causes of climate change . 	0
PE	5123	Nowaday , industrial in many countries still emit high intense of carbon dioxide , which caused of greenhouse effect . 	0
PE	5124	For instance , through taking part in a sport , students can understand team spirit and learn lessons about teamwork skills . 	0
PE	5125	Therefore , these subjects might fulfil the students ' ability . 	1
PE	5126	Finally , children ' s future do not depend heavily on the academic subjects they study in school , it is the result of their efforts and capacity . 	0
PE	5127	In conclusion , although the academic subjects play a primary role in nurturing children , it seem to me that the effects of learning music , sports are profound . 	1
PE	5128	So it is important that government needs to impose rules on particularly advertisement company ( for example , toys company ) to avoid youngster have bias thought on what they really need . 	1
PE	5129	In my opinion , I think buying habit is people ' s choice to make , not entirely affected by advertisements . 	1
PE	5130	But for children or adolescents who is not mentally develop , it might be hard for them not to swayed by advertising . 	0
PE	5131	Blatantly seen , success of most companies stems from young people , whose enterprising ideas that catch up with the world is regarded as wind of refreshment . 	0
PE	5132	This , by all means , is outweigh by youngsters ' adventurousness and bravery . 	0
PE	5133	Hence , with the use of computers we spend less time in search for information , and can get it from different sources . 	0
PE	5134	Second , in a globalized world that we live computers made communications faster , visual and cheaper . 	0
PE	5135	Computers have made life easier 	0
PE	5136	The advent of the computer is one of the results of the development of the advantaged technology . 	0
PE	5137	While some people advocate for the idea that computers have made life more complex and stressful , others support the idea that computers have made life easier and more convenient . 	0
PE	5138	In my point of view , computers brought convenience and easiness to our life since they enabled easier access to information and increased qualities of the communication . 	1
PE	5139	First , computers through internet made our access to information easier . 	1
PE	5140	Through computers we can collect appropriate data very quickly , store it in the hard disc as long as we want and use it when needed . 	0
PE	5141	Search engines such as google , yandex with many features relevant to the characteristics of the information needed enable search of information in few minutes . 	0
PE	5142	Social networks such as facebook , twitter have changed traditional sources of information and decreasing the monopolization of the information by the governments . 	0
PE	5143	I think it ' s fun and educational . 	1
PE	5144	But in the future , it seems that the distance learning become more popular and ordinary in schools . 	0
PE	5145	In conclusion , traditional learning still has many benefits to the students . 	1
PE	5146	Nevertheless , I think it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology , and technology is not the root cause of the gap . 	0
PE	5147	To some extent , the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology , because only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products , and these products can help them to earn more in return . 	1
PE	5148	Under proper use of technology , the human being can be benefit a lot and perpetually from the advancement of it . 	1
PE	5149	In conclusion , the good technology bringing to us is undeniable . 	1
PE	5150	Nowadays , we can talk with our friends online , no matter where we are and how far between us . 	0
PE	5151	In the past time , we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us . 	0
PE	5152	Undoubtedly , everything has two sides and technology is not an exception . 	0
PE	5153	In addition , the Internet gives everyone access to the same information , this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals . 	0
PE	5154	That ' s why we can obtain reward from out excellent knowledge . 	0
PE	5155	To sum up , I would have to say that although we can use the ability of adapting oneself in a new environment , the excellent knowledge will be of more importance . 	1
PE	5156	After we get a job , the destination of we keep accumulating and collecting knowledge is rooted not in fawn on our manager with the ability to adapt this kind of business culture , but in making us excellent and totally master this job . 	0
PE	5157	Finally , we will be rewarded with pride . 	0
PE	5158	Employees will obtain reward from hard-work pursuing excellent knowledge . 	1
PE	5159	Through our whole study life , undergraduate and graduate , we keep learning with the purpose of exerting these knowledge and experience on our job , just like an old Chinese scholar said , the essence of study is utilizing it . 	0
PE	5160	The high reputation and popularity of a company is earned by some brilliant workers in public relation department with excellent skill to propagate this company . 	0
PE	5161	So the company will earn more money and reputation from these workers with excellent knowledge . 	0
PE	5162	Because it can not only benefit our employers , but also ourselves will be rewarded . 	1
PE	5163	Secondly , these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country . 	0
PE	5164	Thus , world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace . 	1
PE	5165	This clearly shows that international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back , sooner or later , to a relative peaceful normality . 	0
PE	5166	For example , when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War , its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers . 	0
PE	5167	Firstly , during times of war , people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event . 	0
PE	5168	This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace , and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols . 	0
PE	5169	It is agreed that large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes , and help them being proud of their nation . 	1
PE	5170	This trend is so deeply engraved in people ' s mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned , even when some participants are facing grievous social problems . 	0
PE	5171	For most folks on Earth , the need to gather in one place , and enjoy competition with other talented people from different cultures through popular games has always been a strong motivation . 	0
PE	5172	Sporting events easing international tensions , releasing patriotic feelings 	0
PE	5173	Giving mobile phones to the unemployed 	0
PE	5174	Today , the rate of unemployment is on the rise and is seriously being debated by many . 	0
PE	5175	Some opine that the best method to minimize this problem is by providing the unemployed with hand phones that have access to the Internet . 	0
PE	5176	They also believe that this solution is the most appropriate way to utilize the public money . 	0
PE	5177	Nevertheless , I agree to this solution only to a certain degree because I feel that giving those with no work a mobile phone each is a total waste of money . 	1
PE	5178	In a positive point of view , when people without jobs have hand phones that have access to the Internet , they will be able to browse the net for more job opportunities . 	0
PE	5179	For example , they can surf the The Star Onlines ' work section to find a job that is suitable for them . 	0
PE	5180	With the help of the net , they can also do more research on the work that they have found apart from looking up on how they can prepare themselves for the job . 	0
PE	5181	Not only that , the mobile phones can also be used to make calls with the companies in which they would like to work with . 	0
PE	5182	In short , if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone , they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive . 	1
PE	5183	These feedbacks , in turn , help raise one ’ s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more . 	0
PE	5184	Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential . 	1
PE	5185	People moved due to a number of reasons , namely better educations or higher salary jobs . 	0
PE	5186	Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries ’ cultures . 	0
PE	5187	More people are migrating to other countries than ever before 	0
PE	5188	The last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries . 	0
PE	5189	Take Australia for example , immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues . 	0
PE	5190	Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows , learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values . 	0
PE	5191	However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values . 	1
PE	5192	Firstly , maintaining one ’ s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments . 	0
PE	5193	Hence , taking advice from parents , the young adult can go through obstacles easily . 	1
PE	5194	If the parents do not help him immediately , he would have to suffer more pain . 	0
PE	5195	If the government encourage the use of nuclear , solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity . 	0
PE	5196	Therefore , it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources . 	1
PE	5197	Firstly , the major source of energy today is water . 	0
PE	5198	Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source . 	0
PE	5199	To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short . 	0
PE	5200	Thus , during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India . 	0
PE	5201	Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy 	0
PE	5202	The increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past . 	0
PE	5203	It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly . 	0
PE	5204	I will analyze these areas in the essay . 	0
PE	5205	People in society must do more than paying taxes to contribute to their society . 	1
PE	5206	For instance , people should have knowledge about their own culture and history by studying at school with full concentration or reading them from books . 	0
PE	5207	On the other hand , a person has to unite with other people in the community so as to develop their nation . 	0
PE	5208	Indeed , if people in society have a strong bond with each other , society will become a peaceful place , where people are helping and sharing to each other . 	0
PE	5209	Taking everything into account , I strongly believe that being a citizen involves in a number of duties , other than paying taxes . 	1
PE	5210	On top of that , till now , there are no surveys or evidences that prove this method in effective in reducing the rate of unemployment . 	1
PE	5211	To put it in a nutshell , the suggestion of providing those who are jobless with mobile phones that are accessible to internet is not a proper and the best way to trim down the rate of unemployment . 	1
PE	5212	To illustrate this further , the money can be used to build more amenities for the public or given to the poor so that they can use it to help them earn a living . 	0
PE	5213	To conclude , the money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed . 	1
PE	5214	Nonetheless , looking from another perspective , supplying hand phones to the unemployed is a waste of the taxpayers ' money . 	0
PE	5215	This is because the money instead of being used to supply the electronic gadget can be used for other useful purposes for the country . 	0
PE	5216	Some might even go to the extent of lying that they are on unemployment to make them eligible to get the phones . 	0
PE	5217	In this context , the public ' s money is spent worthlessly . 	0
PE	5218	Furthermore , when hand phones are provided for free , many would want to take advantage of this opportunity . 	1
PE	5219	It will not be surprising that in order to obtain a mobile phone , they make themselves jobless . 	0
PE	5220	There are many advantage of these invention , telephones and email . 	0
PE	5221	Telephones and emails have made personal communication less required 	0
PE	5222	I personally disagree with this notion that these types of communication , telephones and email , made people less personal . 	1
PE	5223	Communication between people by using telephones and email made my life easier . 	1
PE	5224	To begin with , telephones and email help people , who live far away from other people , to connect each other . 	1
PE	5225	I will give several reasons to support my opinion . 	0
PE	5226	I can using telephones and email to talk or write directly to people I want to connect with . 	0
PE	5227	Unlike email , send message by using mail service could be lost and could be sent to wrong address . 	0
PE	5228	Consequently , I can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want . 	0
PE	5229	For example , right now , I am in the U . S . It is not possible to have conversation in person with my parents , who live in my country . 	0
PE	5230	I believe that studying abroad has many advantages . 	1
PE	5231	Students gain a lot out of the experience personally , academically , and culturally . 	1
PE	5232	Studies abroad and the cultural aspect of the experience 	0
PE	5233	After that I understood , I had to never judge with people ' s appearance . 	0
PE	5234	But people should be careful with what they eat , because some industrial foods are very bad for their health , so they should buy only food from well known brands . 	1
PE	5235	All in all , that ease to prepare food has improved people ’ s lives . 	1
PE	5236	And that happened mainly because of the development of the technology . 	0
PE	5237	For example , if a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend , he could just buy some food that comes with instructions . 	0
PE	5238	Normally you just need to put it into the oven and wait some time . 	0
PE	5239	Living on your own is a huge financial commitment . 	0
PE	5240	At younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job , so It can be a difficult task to pay for rent , food , utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself . 	0
PE	5241	So , I believe that living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income . 	1
PE	5242	Another advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them . 	1
PE	5243	Young adults preference on how long they should live with their parents before moving out 	0
PE	5244	As young people gets older they tend to seek more freedom and want to live on their own . 	0
PE	5245	But , the issue of what is the right age for young adults to leave their parents and start living on their own is a contentious one . 	0
PE	5246	Personally , I believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time . 	1
PE	5247	Parents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life . 	0
PE	5248	Living together develops the environment of discussing adult ' s physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents . 	0
PE	5249	Unfortunately , many people play role to cheat the others , and they try to hide their real personality with their appearance . 	0
PE	5250	This is another downside of growing up in the countryside . 	0
PE	5251	Crimes kill someone which is illegal ; nevertheless , the government use law to punish them , which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one . 	0
PE	5252	Growing up in the countryside is not such a good experience , you won ’ t know a lot of people , there are gossips everywhere , and your life will be really limited . 	1
PE	5253	If someday I have children , I ’ m absolutely sure that they will grow up in a good neighborhood of a big city and they will be very happy about it . 	1
PE	5254	" Capital punishment or the death penalty is a legal process whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime . " 	0
PE	5255	Capital punishment ; 51% countries have polished death penalty 	0
PE	5256	In the whole world , 51% countries have polished death penalty ; even , it is at 98% in Europe . 	0
PE	5257	In recently years , many countries have polished the law of the death penalty . 	0
PE	5258	However , others argue that it is not essential to control violence in society by the death penalty . 	0
PE	5259	Some people claim that without this punishment our lives would be less secure and crimes of violence would increase . 	0
PE	5260	Firstly , capital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture . 	0
PE	5261	Personally , I think it is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty because of many reasons . 	1
PE	5262	Finally , in big cities children access to media easily , so they can learn a lot of things by watching television and surfing through the net . 	1
PE	5263	Via internet they can have connection with the other children all around the world , therefor they can exchange their knowledge , they can learn different cultures . 	1
PE	5264	To sum up , although countrysides have some advantages such as fresh air , peace , and etc . Today ' s children needs somethings to entertain them , and occupy their leisure time in the best way . 	1
PE	5265	That ' s why I believe that the excellent knowledge of this job will be more significant . 	1
PE	5266	Admittedly , the ability to adapt oneself to the new environment has been proven to be part of job . 	1
PE	5267	This ability is helpful in communicating with other workmates , cooperating with other workers needs this ability , too . 	0
PE	5268	But working alone is a longer-term job than communicating , that is , the ability of adapting oneself to a new environment may be necessary for a fresh worker , but the excellent knowledge of this job will be benefit till one leave . 	0
PE	5269	Excellent knowledge is better than ability to adopt oneself 	0
PE	5270	With the rapid development of economy , the controversial of good worker ' s requirement is always in a limelight . 	0
PE	5271	A large number of people will say the ability to adapt oneself to a new environment is necessary , because it is the basic communication skill for a new worker . 	0
PE	5272	From my perspective , there is only one thing would be beneficial to company , and there is only one way to be an outstanding worker , that is possessing excellent knowledge of this job . 	1
PE	5273	Therefore , I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money , and that did influence me in my life now . 	0
PE	5274	Unfortunately , I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend . 	0
PE	5275	In my views , I agree that it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare their adult life for several reasons . 	1
PE	5276	Parents can use many methods to guide them to achieve that , for example , asking them to do some housework or clean the rooms by themselves . 	0
PE	5277	Nowadays , the society has become exceedingly competitive than ever before , parents have the responsibilitis to teach their children to survive and to be indepedent from them , just as animals teach their offspring skills of finding foods . 	0
PE	5278	Parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life 	0
PE	5279	At the beginning of the semester , I was told to buy a text book . 	0
PE	5280	Take me as an example , when I was 16 , I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own . 	0
PE	5281	Thus , it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money . 	1
PE	5282	First of all , when children get a job , they are able to earn money by themselves , instead of getting pocket money from their parents . 	0
PE	5283	By way of conclusion , it is my belief that distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases . 	1
PE	5284	However , discussions and interactions should be held via video conferencing frequently so that the joy of learning would not be diminished . 	0
PE	5285	They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life . 	0
PE	5286	It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive . 	0
PE	5287	For example , the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign . 	0
PE	5288	Thus , the possibility of the conflicts is reduced because the understanding between both parties . 	0
PE	5289	Furthermore , the tour guide are willing to help tourists to understand the culture from other countries . 	0
PE	5290	Hence , I think international tourism leads to both tension and understanding between people from different culture . 	1
PE	5291	Obviously , people are looking for the solution such as understanding each other while they encounter the conflicts caused by international tourism . 	1
PE	5292	A greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues 	0
PE	5293	In today ' s world , the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens . 	0
PE	5294	I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients . 	0
PE	5295	Therefore , society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients . 	1
PE	5296	For instance , Thomas Edison is undeniably considered as one of the greatest inventors in the 20th century since his invention ' s productivity is countless useful for mankind . 	0
PE	5297	More importantly , the more beneficial for the society his achievement is , the more successful he is considered . 	0
PE	5298	A person ' s great prosperity does not state that he has gained it ethically by himself . 	0
PE	5299	Money is undeniably pivotal , but ways of earning it is also various . 	0
PE	5300	Whether it is a personal or a social achievement , that man is laudable . 	0
PE	5301	Nevertheless , a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard-working , dedication and passion . 	1
PE	5302	It ' s such a common definition of a successful person is one who has earned a lot of money , especially in nowadays society . 	0
PE	5303	A successful person is one who has earned a lot of money 	0
PE	5304	Still , my term of a successful man is one who has certain achievements in life rather than the one with a high income . 	1
PE	5305	Each individual visualize success differently . 	0
PE	5306	People are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology ; nevertheless , behind the glamorous facade of it , what we loss will never be returned . 	1
PE	5307	The introduction of foreign language will be new to them ; however , their curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend . 	0
PE	5308	Nevertheless , it is undeniable that kids are amazing learners , and the best time to hone them is in their younger years . 	0
PE	5309	In addition , the positive impact of this strategy is beneficial to both learners and teachers . 	0
PE	5310	In this way , grasping a new language will be natural to them . 	0
PE	5311	It is certainly clear that the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages . 	1
PE	5312	Teachers will not find it difficult to make students learn such new concept in their teenage years . 	0
PE	5313	I am totally convinced that if this endeavour is properly implemented by schools , this will most likely lead to improvement of learning ability among children . 	1
PE	5314	In conclusion , the use of foreign language instruction as early as kindergarten is supported by some people ; however , there are those who disagree . 	0
PE	5315	In conclusion , if children take part in some kind of paid work with their parents ' permission , they can learn lively lessons and become mature and responsible . 	1
PE	5316	However , if children get good care and instructions from their parents , they can take advantages of the work to learn valuable things and avoid going in a wrong way . 	0
PE	5317	It ' s just like a picky mirror through which we can see the bad side of us and thus try to become more beautiful and confident . 	0
PE	5318	In conclusion , criticism is essential especially in group working but in other occasions we still need criticism . 	1
PE	5319	And it ' s kind of art to make the best use of criticism . 	0
PE	5320	You should have your own judgments too ! 	0
PE	5321	Taking criticism doesn ' t necessary mean that you have to take it all . 	0
PE	5322	In my point of view , even if you are right , criticism is still helpful because in this case it not only is a fixer , but it also serves as a practice to test you how much you know about your work . 	1
PE	5323	Doesn ' t insistence also a good character ? 	0
PE	5324	What if that I was at first right but the seemingly reasonable criticism led me to the wrong direction ? 	0
PE	5325	Computers expose children to vulgar materials . 	0
PE	5326	Virus programs , privacy breach , leak of confidential documents , cyber attacks , identity theft , frauds etc . are some of its demerits , from a countless list . 	0
PE	5327	Nanotechnology is working to make computers to the order of microscopic levels . 	0
PE	5328	From a computer as big as a room , it has now been minimized to the size of a palm . 	0
PE	5329	Along with the advancement of long-distance transportation , international tourism has boomed in the last few decades . 	0
PE	5330	By working too long , they often become tired , lazy and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy and eventually loose health and become sick . 	0
PE	5331	Moreover , they become extensively addicted to their work and become workaholic type persons . 	0
PE	5332	There is a saying in my native village , " Health is Wealth " . 	0
PE	5333	I believe many of people including me are not really considering the importance of health . 	0
PE	5334	Working Extended hours should restricted 	0
PE	5335	Working longer hours is becoming prevalent in these days . 	0
PE	5336	In my opinion , a balance between personal and professional life should be created by restricting maximum number of working hours . 	1
PE	5337	First of all , many of us would agree to the fact that people ; who prefer working longer hours , do not find time to focus on their health . 	1
PE	5338	The need for increased working hours might be because of enhanced competitive environment and desire to acquire much money and promotion . 	0
PE	5339	However , people working for extended hours have been found having adverse effects on their health and personal life . 	1
PE	5340	Based on these grounds , it seems that tourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources , and it should not be encouraged . 	0
PE	5341	Having three reasons helps us to bring up students who are well-educated , with a bright and independent mind . 	0
PE	5342	In conclusion , as a young women I want my children to get knowledge they have desire to study in order to have distinguished achievement so it has advantage not only for him or her but for society as well . 	1
PE	5343	Furthermore , this type of opportunities can raise future geniuses . 	1
PE	5344	When schools can give such kind of opportunity the students are likely do their best and succeed in their future lives which is one of the point most people get education . 	0
PE	5345	Lastly , the most important reason I support this idea is he or she can explore in an area she / he has an aptitude . 	0
PE	5346	Because of the technology of internet and air transportation , businessmen are able to handle plenty of international trade and financial transactions . 	0
PE	5347	This also helps many countries to more efficiently export their products to the world and increase their revenue . 	0
PE	5348	Besides , advanced technology enables people to enhance their living-level and health care standard . 	1
PE	5349	With the improvement of medical technology , it is obvious that the life expectancy in many countries has been significantly longer than before , and many serious diseases are under control . 	0
PE	5350	Technological progress in the past century has its negative effect 	0
PE	5351	In the past few decades , there were many remarkable achievements in technology fields that have numbers of beneficial effects on the whole society or individuals , although bringing some disadvantages to us . 	1
PE	5352	On one hand , the development of technology can prompt economic growth and the improvement of living standards . 	1
PE	5353	Scientists and engineers have invented many novel products and tools , which play an important role in economic activity . 	0
PE	5354	Digital entertainment technology allows people to enjoy playing interactive video games and watching three-dimensional movies , and this means that we could get more happiness from technology . 	0
PE	5355	On the other hand , the development of technology is likely to bring some negative effects on the environment and society . 	1
PE	5356	Technology , in the past two hundred years , has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society , such as telecommunications , manufacturing and buildings , etc . Certainly , technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives . 	0
PE	5357	Technology that widen the gap between rich and poor ? 	0
PE	5358	Personally , I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons . 	0
PE	5359	However , today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor . 	0
PE	5360	About ten years ago , mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country , only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one . 	0
PE	5361	In the first instance , the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products . 	0
PE	5362	Thus , most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements , especially the poor people . 	1
PE	5363	Today , mobile phones become a common one of household items , which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies . 	0
PE	5364	With the development of Internet , we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day . 	0
PE	5365	Secondly , technical developments improve productivity , which help people to escape from daily chores , and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life . 	1
PE	5366	Moreover , there are problems if paying teacher by grade students get . 	1
PE	5367	Teacher may not care about how they have to teach to make students understand the topics . 	0
PE	5368	Teachers may just give high grades to get higher salary . 	0
PE	5369	This problem should not be happened . 	0
PE	5370	Therefore , grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher . 	1
PE	5371	I have to wait for an hour to go to my friend house . 	0
PE	5372	The traffic in the city was too crowed . 	0
PE	5373	Last week , I went to the city center to meet my friends . 	0
PE	5374	We have large streets but few cars , so we can move easily to anywhere . 	0
PE	5375	In conclusion , I strongly feel that staying in one place is better than moving number of places . 	1
PE	5376	There were a lot of people so the environment can ' t be keep clean . 	0
PE	5377	I have been gone to some places to travel and stay for a short time , and I realize that the environment in some place isn ' t clean and fresh like my home town . 	0
PE	5378	I also love the environment in here . 	1
PE	5379	Moving some places can give to you a lot of experiences but living in one place like your hometown can make you feel comfortable about the traffic , people and of course the environment . 	1
PE	5380	If you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam . 	0
PE	5381	You cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck , even if you be a very lucky . 	0
PE	5382	Finally , you have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way . 	0
PE	5383	Undoubtedly it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam . 	0
PE	5384	These plans is done by someone who is mastered in his / her work . 	0
PE	5385	The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance . 	1
PE	5386	In the end , I think any great success need great work not great luck , even though luck is one factor in reaching goal but its impact is extraneous and we must not reckon on luck in our plans . 	1
PE	5387	Undoubtedly such people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works . 	0
PE	5388	To sum up , new technology has affected cultures of the world , and we can see many similarities in many cultures . 	1
PE	5389	For example , two days ago , I went to a Canadian restaurant , and I ate noodle , sushi , which are Chinese foods , and Greek salad . 	0
PE	5390	In fact , new technology has influences on educational system , jobs and foods in the world . 	1
PE	5391	Some people might argue that there are some cultures such as making foods which are unicq in each culture , and technology cannot affect them . 	1
PE	5392	This example shows that jobs that are related to technology are in demand in most of the countries . 	0
PE	5393	In fact , cooks can find many new food recipes easily on the Internet . 	0
PE	5394	This point has some merits on the surface ; however , many countries such as Canada , the USA , and British have many restaurants which serve many foods form different countries and cultures . 	0
PE	5395	Which do you prefer : do only what you already do well , or not . 	0
PE	5396	Those who disagree , believe that globalization contribute effectively to the global improvement of the world in many aspects . 	1
PE	5397	As a fact that the criminal is repeated second time ; also , it is regarded as the " legalized revenge " to victims ' family . 	0
PE	5398	Some people prefer to recognize globalization as a threat to ethnic and religious values of people of their country . 	1
PE	5399	They think that the idea of globalization put their inherited culture in danger of uncontrolled change and make them vulnerable against the attack of imperialistic governments . 	0
PE	5400	Globalization as a gradual change affecting all over the world is not an exception . 	0
PE	5401	Although it has undeniable effects on the economics of the world ; it has side effects which make it a controversial issue . 	0
PE	5402	Effects of globalization 	0
PE	5403	In a big city you have more qualified teachers and a better access to technology . 	1
PE	5404	In addition , they admit that globalization can be considered a chance for people of each country to promote their lifestyle through the stuffs and services imported from other countries . 	0
PE	5405	Moreover , the proponents of globalization idea point out globalization results in considerable decrease in global tension due to convergence of benefits of people of the world which is a natural consequence of globalization . 	1
PE	5406	There are many ways of teaching . 	0
PE	5407	Sports activities can improve mental health as well . 	1
PE	5408	Many studies has points out that numbers of overweight people have increased in developed countries in recent years , which mainly results from insufficient exercises . 	0
PE	5409	Although miscellaneous people may apply diverse strategies , such as reading , watching movies , or working in their gardens , I argue that the most suitable method of reducing stress for modern people is by different kinds of exercise , which can not only improve health conditions but also bring positive emotions . 	1
PE	5410	Therefore , it is necessary for many to find ways to relax . 	0
PE	5411	In modern society , people often face many difficulties under great stress . 	0
PE	5412	The best way to relax is by exercises 	0
PE	5413	The latter one is of particular importance because nowadays more and more people are suffer from obesity . 	0
PE	5414	Moreover , these sports can also strengthen muscles and lessen surplus adipose tissues in human body . 	0
PE	5415	Any kinds of sports , such as jogging , swimming , or playing basketball , can effectively facilitate human respiration and circulation system . 	0
PE	5416	It is not surprised that exercise play a crucial role in ameliorating physical health . 	1
PE	5417	While I was in senior high school , my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas . 	0
PE	5418	For instance , my father had a a breakdown several years ago due to his stressful job . 	0
PE	5419	After several weeks off his body was restored , now he has reduced the tempo of his lifestyle and is doing fine . 	0
PE	5420	In my opinion , it is very important to live life at a slower pace , because living in a hurry comes along with several disadvantages . 	1
PE	5421	First , living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health . 	1
PE	5422	If you are always hurried and you do not take a certain time off , your body will react to your stressful lifestyle . 	0
PE	5423	Many hardworking people have diseases , like the burn-out syndrome , because their bodies cannot hold the pace . 	0
PE	5424	Rush vs Slower Pace 	0
PE	5425	Modern technologies and globalization have increased the speed of life in the past decades tremendously . 	0
PE	5426	However , while the majority of people live on the fast lane , others decide to reduce the speed and take their time . 	0
PE	5427	To draw an entire picture , we have to consider both the advantages and disadvantages of this increased speed of life and ask our self which way of life is better . 	0
PE	5428	However , some cases occupy a crucial reason to do a criminality in society such unemployment . 	0
PE	5429	In my view , the main focus is decreasing a level of unemployment to avoid a criminal act . 	0
PE	5430	Many well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably . 	0
PE	5431	Secondly , cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive , so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs . 	0
PE	5432	Many baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport , for instance . 	0
PE	5433	In conclusion , it seems to me that the guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence . 	1
PE	5434	Nowadays , computers enable people to prepare presentations , draw complex graphs and pictures , document thesis in a simple though efficient way . 	0
PE	5435	As an example , students preparing for delivering speech on a certain topic can browse through internet to learn each and every minute details of the subject matter . 	0
PE	5436	It ' s hard to get everything at a same place unless children are not familiar with computers . 	0
PE	5437	Some students enjoy taking part in some research . 	0
PE	5438	For instance , some Asians are seeking individualism , previously denied by many Asian countries , due to the fact that they have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies , which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English . 	0
PE	5439	On the other hand , there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities . 	1
PE	5440	Firstly , the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries . 	0
PE	5441	Obviously , police officers can force a criminal to surrender , because they have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public . 	0
PE	5442	As a result , some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence . 	1
PE	5443	On the one hand , I agree that a police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun . 	0
PE	5444	An obvious example of this happens in The United State , a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon , while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him . 	0
PE	5445	Some inhabitants argue that this case appears because the guns are always used by a police to solve a criminal act . 	0
PE	5446	Personally , I tend to disagree with this statement , while I believe that other factors contribute a slight incline level of violence . 	0
PE	5447	Do guns can really increase the level of violence ? 	0
PE	5448	The number of criminality is increase rapidly throughout the world . 	0
PE	5449	Therefore , we can commence to agree that certain facilities are beneficial to students . 	1
PE	5450	Some people believe that this has brought more problems than benefits . 	0
PE	5451	The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that the more advanced facilities we have , the more chances we can increase our knowledge . 	0
PE	5452	Problems and benefits of international tourism 	0
PE	5453	Therefore , past obviously saves ourselves a bunch of failures and times . 	1
PE	5454	Secondly , people ' s success in the past is as significant as those mistakes . 	1
PE	5455	As everyone ' s life is too short to risk trying anything without any prepare , we all should learn about other ' s mistakes so that we can avoid making the same ones . 	0
PE	5456	Each mistake , from the smallest to the bigger one , is a treasure of experience , which , if we can make full use of , will make us well-prepared for many complicated situations of our life . 	0
PE	5457	Although it is true that life changes rapidly , there are many things in the past that we can learn about , such as mistakes , success and knowledge in many fields of study . 	1
PE	5458	First of all , the predecessors ' mistakes are the first thing that we should consider when learning about the past . 	0
PE	5459	Success and knowledge 	0
PE	5460	Many people think that " Past has nothing to do with present , as time never stops , the next generations are completely different from the predecessors " . 	0
PE	5461	Improving facilities is the best way 	0
PE	5462	If the predecessors ' mistakes are the indirect way that leads us to the goals , others ' accomplishment can be served as the direct way . 	0
PE	5463	By looking into the ways other people use to achieve their targets , we have the chance to make those mine , put them into practice and , of course , be successful like them . 	0
PE	5464	Some people tend to prefer that schools should invest in renewing facilities , while other seem to believe that famous teachers is more conducive to students . 	0
PE	5465	In order to meet the needs of tourists , local governments are likely to build more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions , which may result in the destruction of natural habitats . 	0
PE	5466	The option to work or study from home is advantage or disadvantage 	0
PE	5467	Undoubtedly this is an era of internet which impacts one ' s personal as well as professional life . 	0
PE	5468	The effect is seen more on the developed countries where people choose to work or study from home instead of going to office or university . 	0
PE	5469	Some consider this approach to be an advantage while others reject this as a disadvantage . 	0
PE	5470	Both the points of views will be discussed in order . 	0
PE	5471	On the one hand , the benefit that professionals or students get by connecting from home is enormous . 	0
PE	5472	For one , it helps working people to maintain work life balance . 	0
PE	5473	The best example is the new mother who can join her work as well as take care of her baby . 	0
PE	5474	People also get the desired flexibility in terms of working hours . 	0
PE	5475	For students too , studying from home is an attractive option . 	0
PE	5476	For instance , the Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafés , hospital and shopping street . 	0
PE	5477	Secondly , the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender . 	1
PE	5478	Therefore , the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented . 	1
PE	5479	A large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases . 	0
PE	5480	Recent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking . 	0
PE	5481	Firstly , it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time . 	0
PE	5482	It is agreed that the move will do more good by looking at the quality of health and image of a nation in long run . 	1
PE	5483	As a result , some businesses prohibit smoking in their premises and even some governments restrict smoking in public area . 	0
PE	5484	The awareness on harmful effects from smoking among the general public has put much pressure on the government and private sectors . 	0
PE	5485	Prohibit public smoking ? 	0
PE	5486	Once student ' s starts earning , they might not like to go back to studies where they would lose their financial independence . 	0
PE	5487	They might even find it difficult to adapt to education environment . 	0
PE	5488	There is also a risk of student never going back to university or higher education . 	0
PE	5489	Probably some might take some short term courses instead of proper and complete university education , which will help them to get a better job and salaries . 	0
PE	5490	This might only help them in a short run as it is a known fact that to make a reasonable career in longer runs , one needs a proper and higher qualification . 	0
PE	5491	In my view point , I would agree to idea of taking a break before starting higher education . 	1
PE	5492	Students who take break , gain lot of benefits by traveling around the places or by working . 	1
PE	5493	They tend to contribute more due to their real world experiences which makes them more mature . 	0
PE	5494	On top of that , due to the lack of genuine passion on the work which was not of their option , there is a greater possibility for their performance standard to dwindle at their workplace . 	0
PE	5495	Apart from that , not all elderly workers are physically well . 	0
PE	5496	I , for one , strongly agree that age should be set as a criterion for people to retire at the aforementioned age due to several reasons that I shall discuss below . 	1
PE	5497	First and foremost , if senior workers dominate the working sector , there will be lesser job opportunities for the fresh graduates . 	0
PE	5498	As a result , most of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for . 	1
PE	5499	To illustrate this further , a medical graduate might find it very disheartened when he had to spend around five precious years studying medicine and at the end of the day , he will have to take up another profession rather than doctor due to the insufficient job opportunities available . 	0
PE	5500	Should people be forced to stop working ? 	0
PE	5501	The appropriate age at which a person should stop working is now a much debated issue in the society . 	0
PE	5502	Some opine that people should be given the option to choose when they want to call it a day while others oppose this notion . 	0
PE	5503	In my personal point of view , the right age for a person to retire should be around 60 years old . 	1
PE	5504	In this case , the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them , so that they can have the chance to get back to work . 	0
PE	5505	They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support . 	0
PE	5506	In conclusion , my point of view is that , although the government should provide help for the disadvantaged people , direct financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity . 	1
PE	5507	After all , it is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again . 	0
PE	5508	In summary , students should find interesting subjects and acquire general knowledge to prepare higher education at tertiary education . 	1
PE	5509	Therefore , schools should be responsible for their future and protect them . 	1
PE	5510	Those activities have proven that women can also do the men ' s works . 	0
PE	5511	For instance , you sometimes need knowledge about physics to read a text on chemistry . 	0
PE	5512	In addition , although textbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects , in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects . 	0
PE	5513	Science today , for example , is said to be more and more specialized , but in order to solve a problem scientists have to combine knowledge from chemistry to physics . 	0
PE	5514	General education plays a significant role in specialized education . 	0
PE	5515	This might result in limited choices in the future . 	0
PE	5516	They might avoid tough courses , but instead attend mainly Mickey Mouse courses and enjoy themselves too much . 	0
PE	5517	Last but not least , students have tendency to shun difficulties . 	0
PE	5518	Therefore , high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university . 	1
PE	5519	Moreover , I did not have to worry about costs and other things , I just had fun and learned . 	0
PE	5520	For example , when I was young I just came home from school and then I would took my bike or soccer ball and go out and play with my friends in my neighborhood . 	0
PE	5521	Next , students should obtain knowledge from a variety of academic fields . 	0
PE	5522	For instance , a would-be mathematician student may be strongly intrigued by philosophy and make a success in the field . 	0
PE	5523	We can see now that women tend to work in various fields which in the past normally done by men such as being engineers , and dealing with machines . 	0
PE	5524	I think , however , students should study a broad range of subjects from literature to mathematics . 	1
PE	5525	They believe this motivates students to study . 	0
PE	5526	Some people state that high schools should allow students to study what they want to . 	0
PE	5527	High schools must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum 	0
PE	5528	They should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects , otherwise they might miss valuable encounter with the subject . 	0
PE	5529	To begin with , students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested . 	1
PE	5530	In addition , it should be to some extent paternalistic to prevent students from avoiding hurdles . 	1
PE	5531	I believe that tertiary education should make students prepare for specialization at university . 	1
PE	5532	In many societies , choice of a job depends on the size of the salary offered . 	0
PE	5533	Factor of choosing a career . 	0
PE	5534	To begin with , I agree that in order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well . 	1
PE	5535	Nevertheless , while I admit that the salary is very pivotal factor , I claim that there are other equally vital aspects that need to be considered in this regard . 	1
PE	5536	People , for instance , who don ' t like their co-workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs , despite of a high salary . 	0
PE	5537	However , aspects such as : friendly colleagues , environment and work-place condition , sometimes , have even more impact on person ' s happiness and quality of life . 	0
PE	5538	Further and even more importantly , most of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements , skills and the position they reach . 	0
PE	5539	In this sense , it is also one very salient proof of the accuracy of my position . 	0
PE	5540	For example , people , who work in monotonous jobs , where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied , even though they have a very good salaries . 	0
PE	5541	In other words , career promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are , likely , more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary . 	1
PE	5542	In today ' s world , the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens . 	0
PE	5543	A greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues 	0
PE	5544	In addition , the basic economic course can also help with the students when they go to college . 	1
PE	5545	I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions . 	1
PE	5546	Therefore , society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients . 	1
PE	5547	I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients . 	0
PE	5548	In my opinion , there is nothing more important than health in a human ' s life and the happiness and welfare come with health . 	0
PE	5549	The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society . 	1
PE	5550	For example , the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign . 	0
PE	5551	Therefore , a government ' s role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people ' s lives . 	0
PE	5552	He do a lot of exercise in football field every day , so it is not for which he is luckier than me . 	0
PE	5553	Moreover , we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful . 	1
PE	5554	I mean , when you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success . 	0
PE	5555	For example in football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal . 	0
PE	5556	Statically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty . 	0
PE	5557	But I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me . 	0
PE	5558	On the other hand , universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities , and this could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects . 	1
PE	5559	Government should take interim measures , to regulate admission process for university courses which enables every student to get benefit . 	0
PE	5560	In conclusion , I am firmly supporting the view , that every student either male or female should be given fairly equal opportunity to purse their education in all university subjects , provided they should meet the required qualifications rather than putting limitations based on their gender . 	1
PE	5561	These machines reduce the physical work done by humans . 	0
PE	5562	Machines - positive or negative for humans 	0
PE	5563	It is felt by many that the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans since machines decrease the work done by people . 	1
PE	5564	For example , in many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days . 	0
PE	5565	Some people think that this is a positive development while others believe it to be disadvantageous for humans . 	0
PE	5566	Both sides will be critiqued before a reasoned conclusion is reached . 	0
PE	5567	Mobile phones are not out of expectation . 	0
PE	5568	First of all , almost everything that changed our lifestyle a lot will also cause some social problems . 	1
PE	5569	What is worse , some students utilize their cell phones as an effective cheating tools in examinations in which they can send and receive answers by texting each other . 	0
PE	5570	Speaking loudly on the phone in public areas , such as schools , libraries and hospitals appears to be very impolite and offensive . 	0
PE	5571	Nowadays , the popularity of mobile phones has brought about a lot of convenience but at the meanwhile a variety of problems as well , such as social , medical and technical problems . 	0
PE	5572	Effects of mobile phones 	0
PE	5573	In this essay , I would like to analyze these three issues in order to support my viewpoint . 	0
PE	5574	However , I do not think these disadvantages will outweigh the advantages brought by cell phones . 	1
PE	5575	Children are privileged to have these abilities because they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances . 	0
PE	5576	They are more abstract , requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched . 	0
PE	5577	It is also worth mentioning that some harmful effects on our health are lethal . 	1
PE	5578	Nevertheless , it is not impossible to solve these problems , as long as some regulations and rules can be effectively implemented . 	0
PE	5579	Success needs us to work hard and sacrifice more whether we choose to study alone or with group . 	0
PE	5580	In fact , I agree with the idea of studying a lone since it helps me to focus more and establish my personality . 	1
PE	5581	To conclude , there are many ways to study and it is our right to choose which is suitable for our characters whether alone or with group . 	0
PE	5582	Personally , when I fix my study plan with a specific time and finish it on time , it improves my ability in the future to become more precise and careful . 	0
PE	5583	Also , it motivates us to be accurate in our work in the future . 	0
PE	5584	For example , answering our homework alone encourages us to be more responsible and independent . 	0
PE	5585	Additionally , we are building our personalities when we study alone . 	1
PE	5586	To illustrate this point , I can write about my own experience . 	0
PE	5587	We can talk to them because they listen to us , more than some people will ever do . 	0
PE	5588	In this way , the crime rate is reduced and society becomes a peaceful place , so the country will develop at a rapid pace . 	0
PE	5589	Furthermore , being a citizen in society should protect the country ' s culture and history . 	0
PE	5590	Some people think that pets should be treated like family members . 	0
PE	5591	Cats and dogs are the most common pets but there are birds , tortoises and fishes as well . 	0
PE	5592	Pets have always been essential in our society . 	0
PE	5593	Our useful friends 	0
PE	5594	Similarly to friends , indeed , they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone . 	0
PE	5595	First , pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are . 	1
PE	5596	The issue is controversial but in my opinion , pets should be treated like human beings for different reasons . 	1
PE	5597	However , others argue that they are just animals and aren ' t able to think like us . 	0
PE	5598	First and foremost , today entertainment is easier for people to enjoy than ever before . 	0
PE	5599	The fact is that such news media as televisions , radios , or newspapers are bringing many news on entertainment sector from all over the world to everybody . 	0
PE	5600	It is widely seen that news media not only brings people entertainment , but also polishes up people ' knowledge . 	1
PE	5601	Therefore , it seems not unreasonable to suggest that this is a positive development . 	0
PE	5602	Many people consider that the drawbacks of this phenomenon outweigh its merits . 	0
PE	5603	However , it is possible that this idea is not completely true . 	0
PE	5604	The popularity of news media 	0
PE	5605	Nowadays news media have become more and more popular . 	0
PE	5606	People can sit in front of their televisions and watch whatever they want , from musical concerts to live football match . 	0
PE	5607	This is a convenient way of relaxation after hard work . 	0
PE	5608	Through face-to-face communication , teachers can also pinpoint the weaknesses of each student and therefore , adjusting and tailoring his or her teaching methodology to meet the levels or the demands of those students . 	0
PE	5609	Admittedly , the computer can show whether an answer to a particular question is right or wrong but it cannot give as an in-depth explanation as a human teacher can . 	1
PE	5610	As a result , information from those sources is subject to question . 	1
PE	5611	Much information as the Internet may provide , most of the sources are unjustified by experts . 	0
PE	5612	On the other hand , critics of this idea maintain that although the educational benefits that the Internet may yield are undeniable , there still remain certain shortcomings . 	0
PE	5613	Internet and computer also offer a more comprehensive access to knowledge , ranging from visual to aural stimuli , which make learning an ever enjoyable experience , especially for children . 	0
PE	5614	Central to the supporting arguments of this issue is the idea that the global online network is the inexhaustible source of information , which definitely exceeds the fund of knowledge that any veteran teacher can accumulate . 	1
PE	5615	This idea may point out to two main directions , both of which present different arguments . 	0
PE	5616	With the number of technological advances growing apace , it is generally believed that Internet and computers will supplant the traditional role of teachers in a not too distant future . 	0
PE	5617	Computers replace human teachers 	0
PE	5618	This is a problem that suffers all of us everyday . 	0
PE	5619	At the end , there is no time for call to our parents or friends . 	0
PE	5620	Television is the culprit for destroying communication between friends & family 	0
PE	5621	It is very hard to find a home that does not have a television . 	0
PE	5622	Nowadays , number of television channels and programs are increasing everyday . 	0
PE	5623	Unfortunately , most of people do not have a plan for make a limitation or schedule for watching television . 	1
PE	5624	I agree with that idea that television devastate families ties . 	1
PE	5625	In spite of enjoying watching television shows , it is really time consuming task . 	1
PE	5626	Emergence of new television channels or shows are not surprising . 	0
PE	5627	We kill time by tracking these channels so at the end of the day we understand it is late for doing any other activities . 	0
PE	5628	many people argue about learning their children the financial responsibility in young ages or in adulthood . 	0
PE	5629	One of the best characteristics of a mature adult is responsibility , specially in financially matters . 	0
PE	5630	For instance , I recall my first trip to a zoo , at age eight . 	0
PE	5631	I was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated . 	0
PE	5632	I can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo . 	0
PE	5633	They beat them up because they did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals . 	0
PE	5634	In conclusion , I strongly believe that we have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible . 	1
PE	5635	Scientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals . 	1
PE	5636	Moreover , many zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them . 	1
PE	5637	So it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues . 	1
PE	5638	To clarify my point I would like to say a memory from my childhood , when I was at age 7 my father gave me monthly money to buy thing that I liked . 	0
PE	5639	Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject . 	0
PE	5640	Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children . 	0
PE	5641	Should teenagers learn all school subjects / focus on one subject 	0
PE	5642	Presently , it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school . 	0
PE	5643	The benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized . 	1
PE	5644	In the first place , with some basic knowledge of diverse fields , students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future . 	0
PE	5645	While , others claim that studying only one subject is more effective . 	0
PE	5646	Before rendering my own opinion , I will explore sides of this topic . 	0
PE	5647	Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate . 	0
PE	5648	In students ' point of view , the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes . 	0
PE	5649	If it is a crucial win to acclaim a trophy , you will be " on site " to witness and celebrate the victory . 	0
PE	5650	Furthermore , it can be an exclusive experience . 	0
PE	5651	It can be unforgettable moments in your life . 	1
PE	5652	The first important point that I want to make is that sociologists found that our characteristics and personality forms early in life , even though when we are not borne . 	0
PE	5653	In conclusion , watch a football match on television it is comfortable and pleasing , but watching the match live at the stadium is more enjoyable . 	1
PE	5654	You can watch it at home , but " easy come , easy go " , you will quickly forget it , like a movie . 	0
PE	5655	Second , watching a live football game is an exceptional experience . 	1
PE	5656	You can cherish your experience for a long time . 	0
PE	5657	I firmly believe that the zoo is so useful for the earth . 	1
PE	5658	The tickets to get in the stadium may be a little expensive , but you will gain much more entertainment value from the game . 	0
PE	5659	If the zoo has a large number of both national and foreign tourists , it will receive a great deal of money . 	0
PE	5660	That also make money flow , and then economics become better . 	0
PE	5661	It benefits to a certain country . 	1
PE	5662	In conclusion , the zoo not only saves animals in danger of extinction , but also helps people around the world have better lives . 	1
PE	5663	For example , when I face my parents , I can ' t speak out every idea and express consecutively . 	0
PE	5664	They may stop me , speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say . 	0
PE	5665	Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation . 	0
PE	5666	E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive . 	1
PE	5667	On the whole , to compare to all ways of communication , I really think that e-mail is the greatest way for major people to use . 	1
PE	5668	Its convenience saves our time . 	1
PE	5669	Additionally , honesty is necessary for every conversation and also fluency can ' t be missing for a persuasive expression . 	0
PE	5670	They know something which are not incorporated in such materials as books and webpages . 	0
PE	5671	Hence I , in my class , often communicate with my teacher to find a coordinated answer to a my faced problem , and my classmates are so accustomed to communicating with the teacher . 	0
PE	5672	In addition , the learning with a teacher makes us bear more burdens of studies cause they assign us homework , Nevertheless , I prefer to learn with a teacher rather than learn by myself . 	1
PE	5673	Firstly , The distinguishing fact of the learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies . 	1
PE	5674	In other words , when we encounter difficulty in our study which we can not make out , that asking the difficulty from our teacher is propitious way for us to solve it instantly . 	0
PE	5675	In addition , professors and teachers have much experience and knowledge , and are so dextrous with letting students understand their study . 	0
PE	5676	Learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself . 	0
PE	5677	Every person learn in their own manner which they think that is most expedient to them . 	0
PE	5678	As for the learning by yourself , it has some certain profit . 	0
PE	5679	It gives you a chance to concentrate on what you learn cause there is no one who distracts your attention in presence of you , and your learning becomes more profound . 	0
PE	5680	For example , if you want to learn driving a car or some jobs like medicine and engineering and some sports like skiing and swimming , you ' ll have to find a teacher . 	0
PE	5681	There are some practical subjects that you can only learn them with a teacher or an instructor . 	1
PE	5682	By the way , if you are going to learn some things by yourself , you may learn and understand them incorrectly ! 	0
PE	5683	It ' s almost impossible and inefficient to learn those things on your own . 	0
PE	5684	There are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher because I won ' t have to spend extra money for a teacher and my time will not be wasted either because of going to classes . 	1
PE	5685	For example , from my own experiences , after I had started learning playing the guitar without a teacher , I got used to wrong habits regarding strumming and tempo , but after finding and learning with a tutor and identifying and eliminating those incorrect habits , I was able to play properly . 	0
PE	5686	I can utilize them as tutorials for many things . 	0
PE	5687	In today ' s world there are many great and useful sources available like books , electronic books , the internet and TV and satellite . 	0
PE	5688	In sum , sometimes it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own . 	1
PE	5689	For instance , I can learn English or other languages by a lot of helpful books and many online websites . 	0
PE	5690	Is it necessary for children or not ? 	0
PE	5691	Learning a foreign language is necessary for children to strengthen their ability to learn . 	0
PE	5692	Thereby students in the beginning of their education can learn faster and easier in compare to a young one to understand a foreign language . 	0
PE	5693	They can easily understand the language structure and memorize the vocabularies . 	0
PE	5694	Learning that not only help them to improve their minds and memories , but can extend their visions about the other countries . 	1
PE	5695	First , the ability of Learning in the childhood period is more powerful than other periods of life . 	0
PE	5696	For example , I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn ' t have enough parking lots for the cars . 	0
PE	5697	So , with the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own . 	0
PE	5698	On the other hand by advertising companies , businesses , firms and individuals promote their goods and services . 	1
PE	5699	Thanks to ads we learn about new products , we can compare them and choose what ’ s the best for us . 	0
PE	5700	These days , not only many businesses , but also governments have to rely on advertising . 	1
PE	5701	For example , tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic ' s economy . 	0
PE	5702	In order to promote the country ' s attractions , the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers . 	0
PE	5703	Only well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country . 	0
PE	5704	In conclusion , I think that modern society needs advertising . 	1
PE	5705	Ads will keep us well informed about new products and services , but we should also bear in mind that advertising cigarettes and alcohol will definitely affect our children in negative way . 	1
PE	5706	Should good people are rewarded and bad people are punished in movies or dramas ? 	0
PE	5707	When we watch movies or dramas , some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished . 	0
PE	5708	If we follow just one wing of my life i . e . , studying as a student , after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn ' t have any motivation . 	0
PE	5709	Moreover , they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments . 	1
PE	5710	So , social activities have same rights to receive monetary support . 	1
PE	5711	In my opinion , social groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment . 	0
PE	5712	Thus social activities can help them to be familiar with other ' s mind and different environment . 	0
PE	5713	As a practical epitome , students should be prepared to present in society after their graduation . 	0
PE	5714	Second , besides the academic knowledge , the awareness of social behavior is an important factor for human ' s life . 	0
PE	5715	As a result , sports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health . 	1
PE	5716	In my perspective , more friends and new experience inspire the feeling of happiness and excitement in me . 	0
PE	5717	Such activities can help us to pick up with other students and have more friends . 	0
PE	5718	Living with a roommate saves me a lot of money . 	1
PE	5719	If you have roommates , you can split the rent and utilities among them . 	0
PE	5720	As far as I am concerned , I prefer to live with a roommate . 	1
PE	5721	This is because it saves me money , enables me to socialize , and allows me to get help . 	1
PE	5722	Each makes different decisions . 	0
PE	5723	Some people choose to live alone for privacy , while others choose to live with a roommate for practical reasons . 	0
PE	5724	Living with a roommate is better than Living alone 	0
PE	5725	Many single people have difficulties deciding whether to live with a roommate or to live alone . 	0
PE	5726	This means you can get more for less . 	0
PE	5727	For example , last year , I shared a room off-campus with my friend , and we decided to split the rent and heating bills into half : I was able to save about fifty dollars for heating , and two hundred dollars for rent monthly . 	0
PE	5728	If the address is wrong , then you will know right away . 	0
PE	5729	We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address . 	0
PE	5730	Technology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day . 	0
PE	5731	E-mail or Voice mail Versus Telephone or face to face 	0
PE	5732	Voice mail , e-mail , telephone or just traditional way : face-to-face . 	0
PE	5733	Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much . 	0
PE	5734	Everyone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication . 	1
PE	5735	However , I prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons : convenience , honest expression and fluency in communicating . 	1
PE	5736	For instance , if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth , no matter how far it is , you can keep contact . 	0
PE	5737	You can talk to others from thousands mile . 	0
PE	5738	Moreover , he is still in-touch with some of his classmates and sometimes they get together and share their childhood memories . 	0
PE	5739	For example , my father ' s best moments in his life are in his school years . 	0
PE	5740	There is only one life and one childhood and people should live their childhood thoroughly . 	0
PE	5741	In other words , childhood is , indeed , the most happiest moments in a person ' s life . 	1
PE	5742	Second , childhood is the period where people go to school and learn . 	0
PE	5743	Also , people are most creative when they were children , children imagine new things and games just to have fun and be happy . 	1
PE	5744	There you learn , to find your first love , to make new long-lasting friendships and of-course you will have a lot of fun . 	0
PE	5745	Therefore , school memories are one of the best memories in a person ' s life . 	1
PE	5746	In conclusion , I strongly agree with notion that dancing is an important part of culture because dancing are represent to believe of people . 	1
PE	5747	I felt that people around me happy and group of santas also happy to see people happy . 	0
PE	5748	For instance , I have seen many western movies that when a kingdom have visitor from another kingdom , king or queen would dance to show a splendid of their kingdom culture . 	0
PE	5749	Secondly , dancing can represent to civilization of that culture . 	1
PE	5750	All this is a civilization of their culture . 	0
PE	5751	The way of movement , the way that they costume and also a music while they dance . 	0
PE	5752	And dancing is one of that ways . 	1
PE	5753	Thirdly , many culture , people have many ways to entertain themselves . 	0
PE	5754	For example , many event , such as christmas , last christmas I went to mall to buy gifts , and I was entertained by group of people in santa custom dancing in christmas song . 	0
PE	5755	Both people who see and dance also have a good time . 	0
PE	5756	But if the good people are not always rewarded , we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story . 	0
PE	5757	His habits may be totally different from theirs , his behavior may be inappropriate , but they will have to live with him or even share a room , in order to have less expenses . 	0
PE	5758	Living with such a person may be a huge problem for the young adults . 	0
PE	5759	When the co-tenant do not share their interests and points of view , they will not be able to ask him for advice . 	0
PE	5760	To clarify , my younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of . 	0
PE	5761	In conclusion , I reckon that for the young adults it will be better to live with their parents , because of the benefits they will have . 	1
PE	5762	They will not need to worry about financial problems or if they will get on well with their roommate . 	1
PE	5763	Next , technology destroys the language . 	1
PE	5764	At first , I tried to go through all the instructions but , soon , I gave up because I found out that it is time-consuming and there are too many things to learn . 	0
PE	5765	However , even though I used it for couple months , I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently . 	0
PE	5766	For instance , I use new Iphone which I personally think is great . 	0
PE	5767	What are even worse , young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions . 	0
PE	5768	This has gotten worse with twitter , myspace , and facebook . 	0
PE	5769	Because people try to type as fast as they are talking , they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language . 	0
PE	5770	Ever since people used computers or cellphones to chat with others , they created their own language to communicate . 	0
PE	5771	Moreover , if we let them do anything they can to just make a profit , they will produce products with low qualities and high prices , therefore they might hit consumer ' s life . 	1
PE	5772	For instance , a few months ago it was broadcast from TV that a company which produced baby milk , sold milk which did not have quality and it caused a few babies die . 	0
PE	5773	Firstly , if there is not any control on the businesses and they are permitted to do everything they want , they will threaten the beings ' life such as human , animals and plants . 	1
PE	5774	As every day we read and hear in televisions and newspapers that some factories hit the environment by their toxic substances . 	0
PE	5775	However , I completely disagree with the idea that businesses should be allowed to do anything they want to make a profit . 	1
PE	5776	With this permission they are allowed to hit and damage everything for just making a profit . 	1
PE	5777	Businesses should be only concerned about making profits . 	0
PE	5778	There is no doubt that companies , factories and businesses establish to provide products which are people ' s need and make a profit for their managers . 	0
PE	5779	Whenever I met a difficulty , I would reach him for consulting . 	0
PE	5780	Because he has many experiences , I could save enormous time in finding solution . 	0
PE	5781	First of all , as parents are involved in the same environment , they could thus support much more to their children , such as domain knowledge and industry-related information . 	1
PE	5782	For example , my father is a software programmer , and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge . 	0
PE	5783	Whether to choose a job which is similar to parents ' job or not , different people may hold different opinions . 	0
PE	5784	As far as I am concerned , I think choosing the job that is similar to parents ' jobs could benefit to one ' s career . 	1
PE	5785	In conclusion , all companies , factories and businesses should be monitored by governments and executive , and they do not have to let do anything they want just due to making profit . 	1
PE	5786	They can hit both the environment and human ' s life easily . 	1
PE	5787	Its advantages will outweigh disadvantages as long as the factories dispose their waste and pollution in the correct way . 	0
PE	5788	In conclusion , installation of manufacturing plant is a trend of industrialization for many countries . 	0
PE	5789	In fact most problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well . 	0
PE	5790	Therefore , how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it . 	1
PE	5791	However , it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society . 	0
PE	5792	For instance , in some industrial cities , a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems , such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances . 	0
PE	5793	It is true that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry , such as water pollution , overcrowded traffic and medical problems . 	0
PE	5794	Apart from the one I have mentioned above , another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy . 	0
PE	5795	If I can avoid being a sluggish person , I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully . 	0
PE	5796	I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam because I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place ; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test . 	0
PE	5797	Therefore , we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives . 	1
PE	5798	I favor the former ; that is , I prefer to live in a higher pace condition . 	1
PE	5799	The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks , and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam . 	0
PE	5800	Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks , while others seem to prefer the opposite position . 	0
PE	5801	After deeply pondering over this issue , I also develop my own perspective . 	0
PE	5802	Living in a higher pace is better 	0
PE	5803	There is a hotly debated issue over whether people have to live at a higher or lower pace , and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity . 	0
PE	5804	In conclusion , I admittedly and strongly agree that the merits of email and messaging have reduced amount of ours time to communicate to . 	1
PE	5805	Besides , we need to make sure for the real gathering with our colleague . 	1
PE	5806	In conclusion , i can certainly state that I would rather prefer working in a large company than in a small one . 	1
PE	5807	As well as learning new skills in my field from these workshops . 	0
PE	5808	I have different reasons to hold that , such as having a better chance to find work , having a better salary and having the opportunity to travel around the world to attend international conferences . 	1
PE	5809	For instance , common sense would tell us that a famous and international known company won ' t give the same salary as a small local company . 	0
PE	5810	In other words , this means that the company can give more salaries to its employees . 	0
PE	5811	large companies have an international reputation , as they organize international conferences , meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people . 	1
PE	5812	Third , I love travelling around the world . 	0
PE	5813	It is undeniable that when they are given the opportunity to express themselves , most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies . 	0
PE	5814	First and foremost , if there is control over artists ' ideas , they will definitely lose their sense of creativity in the long run . 	0
PE	5815	In short , without any limitations , there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists . 	1
PE	5816	For example , paintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times . 	0
PE	5817	Artists in most countries are given the freedom to express their thoughts in whatever they do . 	0
PE	5818	Artists ' freedom to express ideas 	0
PE	5819	I however , agree to this only to a certain extent and believe that the artists must be given freedom so that they will produce some really marvelous masterpiece . 	1
PE	5820	Nevertheless , some argue that there should be government restrictions in order to limit their opinions . 	0
PE	5821	Today , many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries . 	0
PE	5822	Furthermore , it is every human ' s right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation . 	0
PE	5823	Although research could bring funding and latest achievements in the field , the research takes up too much teaching time . 	1
PE	5824	As far as I am concerned , professors should spend more time on preparing courses than research . 	1
PE	5825	The precondition of doing research by professors 	0
PE	5826	Nowadays , many professors conduct research while teaching in colleges or universities . 	0
PE	5827	If professors spend a lot of time on research , he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced , which may decrease the quality of classes . 	0
PE	5828	The reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting-edged technologies . 	0
PE	5829	However , living and studying overseas gives the individual a new perspective on the subject that is studied or in general life . 	1
PE	5830	In conclusion , there are many difficulties a student might face when studying and living overseas . 	1
PE	5831	In this way , professors should provide well-preparation courses to convey the state-of-art knowledge for college and university students . 	0
PE	5832	Therefore , professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research . 	1
PE	5833	Finally , human need some crucial things to continue their life , and most of them are industrial such as medicine . 	0
PE	5834	Dwelling is one of the most important human needs after food which is undeniable . 	0
PE	5835	We need farmland to grow crops such as wheat and corn , and there is no doubt that without food people cannot alive for more than some weeks . 	0
PE	5836	Firstly , day by day population is increasing , so human needs for food is increasing as well . 	0
PE	5837	Secondly , people need shelters to protect themselves from mother nature such as wind and flood and wild animals , so they need land to build their houses on it . 	1
PE	5838	Therefore , farmlands are vital for human life . 	1
PE	5839	Nowadays there are some issues which many countries and nations are concern about that . 	0
PE	5840	Some people think that human needs for farmland , housing and industry are more 	0
PE	5841	From my point of view although endangered animals are important , human needs should be considered more . 	1
PE	5842	Two of the most important of them are rate of increasing population and endangered plants and animals . 	0
PE	5843	Thanks to the economical online-teaching , universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains . 	0
PE	5844	Nevertheless , opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates . 	1
PE	5845	Distance-learning vs . attending school in person 	0
PE	5846	A matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance-learning should be promoted as much as possible , or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees . 	0
PE	5847	From my perspective , online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions . 	1
PE	5848	To begin with , distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world . 	1
PE	5849	In earlier times , students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby , regardless of any differences in teaching facilities , teacher ' s qualifications or the school reputation . 	0
PE	5850	Now , however , students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide . 	0
PE	5851	Furthermore , the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students . 	0
PE	5852	Consequently , educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios . 	1
PE	5853	I agree with this viewpoint to some extent . 	0
PE	5854	Admittedly , in concerning the social relationship with peers , some may support that children should watch TV and movies for their rich contents that could give children some topics in conversation . 	1
PE	5855	How can anyone expect children could do well at school if they have those abnormal behaviors ? 	0
PE	5856	It is obvious that there are many programs on TV or movies that are harmful to children in metal and physical health . 	1
PE	5857	What ' s even worse , according to some statistics , there are more and more children have violent tendency , and the reports attribute this to TV programs and movies . 	0
PE	5858	Recently , more and more children smoke because they imitate actors ' behaviors on TV or movies . 	0
PE	5859	Children are not mature enough to make a judgment of what is good or bad , therefore they are likely to imitate the behaviors on TV out of their curiosity . 	0
PE	5860	Moreover , sometimes programs on TV are full of violence and sex which are harmful to children . 	0
PE	5861	I , therefore , did extremely bad at school due to the lack of studying . 	0
PE	5862	I could memorize all channels that TV programs was playing , but I could barely memorize any word on the textbook . 	0
PE	5863	As can be seen , these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world , making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages . 	0
PE	5864	Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper , nowadays , they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet , everywhere and at anytime . 	0
PE	5865	First of all , to obtain information , using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers . 	0
PE	5866	Personally , I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons . 	0
PE	5867	Some people , however , still believe that they can exist for long time ; others disagree , arguing that newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence . 	1
PE	5868	As a result of this , print media such as newspapers have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of readers . 	0
PE	5869	The internet has been more and more popular for recent years , providing people with a huge source of information . 	0
PE	5870	Will newspapers become a thing of the past ? 	0
PE	5871	Another point is that , from the economic aspect , buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one . 	0
PE	5872	Hence , the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information . 	1
PE	5873	Actually what is the best way to learn responsibility ? 	0
PE	5874	Hence , people will have more ways to go to a place . 	0
PE	5875	Since now buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community , It makes people in this area have no choice . 	0
PE	5876	However , it is difficult to find a community which can perfectly meet our requirements . 	0
PE	5877	In my hometown , there are almost complete public utilities for one ’ s needs but transportation . 	0
PE	5878	One important thing that I want to change about my hometown 	0
PE	5879	Public utilities and surroundings are the primary factors which we basically consider before we decide to live in a place . 	0
PE	5880	And this problem seem to get worst . 	0
PE	5881	At first , it should have more alternatives to use public transportation , such as a subway train or a sky train . 	1
PE	5882	So the thing that I really want to change is to have more public transportation . 	1
PE	5883	Since I ’ m facing the traffic congestion every day . 	1
PE	5884	First time I spend the whole money to eat at school and my money finished . 	0
PE	5885	I asked my father for extra money , but he refuse to give it to me . 	0
PE	5886	The high technology and new ideas applied into practice may not only lead a country to flourish but also elevate its status in the international community . 	0
PE	5887	Some may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention , but this argument is invalid . 	0
PE	5888	As a result you might make mistakes , you would not have done with more patience . 	1
PE	5889	To illustrate , I once wrote an essay in a hurry and got a bad grade , because I made few mistakes I could have avoided . 	0
PE	5890	When you are faced with difficult tasks and you do them in a rush , you are more likely to do avoidable errors or mistakes . 	0
PE	5891	Doing tasks in a hurry may end up in not considering all necessary aspects or opportunities . 	0
PE	5892	For example , a friend of mine lives at a slow pace and is really satisfied about it , because he can enjoy his family and cultivate his friendships . 	0
PE	5893	That ' s not enough , for higher education , which represent the cutting edge of a country ' s academic achievements , act as the vanguard in economic and social advance . 	0
PE	5894	Government budget focus , young children or university ? 	0
PE	5895	" Education is the investment in our future " , as Senator Bernie Sanders once pointed out , education , which fosters a civilized society , plays a significant role in a country ' s long-lasting prosperity . 	0
PE	5896	In addition , living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness . 	1
PE	5897	As for the two integral components within the system , elementary and advanced education , there ' s no doubt that a government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both . 	1
PE	5898	However , other people believe that the existence of zoos is next to nothing . 	0
PE	5899	In my opinion , the zoo deserves maintenance and public respect for two specific reasons . 	1
PE	5900	Hence , I recommend that big sports events should be held more frequently in the future . 	0
PE	5901	For a long time , the zoo has been a second home to endangered animals . 	0
PE	5902	At a higher level , it is of university students ' benefits to do biological research based on practical statistics and live recordings , which otherwise would not be at hand . 	0
PE	5903	This means that the zoos conduce to the acquisition of knowledge at various levels . 	0
PE	5904	First of all , the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners . 	1
PE	5905	With zoos , pupils will have a chance of observing the habit and unique instinct of , for instance , a lion or a crocodile . 	0
PE	5906	People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags , banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President . 	0
PE	5907	The eager atmosphere lasted many next days . 	0
PE	5908	When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others , many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness . 	0
PE	5909	For instance , when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008 , a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets . 	0
PE	5910	Therefore , it can be said that sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen . 	1
PE	5911	In conclusion , international sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely . 	1
PE	5912	In fact , some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally . 	0
PE	5913	However , the hooligans only took a minority of people . 	0
PE	5914	I remembered how I was suffered in the first round when I was last person who touched the line . 	0
PE	5915	However , I did not give up , and believed that I would be better in the next round because I knew how to improve myself . 	0
PE	5916	I had been a loser for a thousand time before the first winning , and suffering from losing in each competition makes me stronger . 	0
PE	5917	Thirdly , at some point , we , as an average people , might feel that the responsibility to our goal is too heavy to carry on . 	0
PE	5918	I believe that the responsibility is worthy of carrying . 	1
PE	5919	When the distance is longer and harder to achieve , a runner who can go beyond his limit will proud of himself . 	0
PE	5920	He can feel the sweetness of triumph because he did not stop pursing his goal . 	0
PE	5921	For these reasons , I agree that one should not give up , as the true reward is to have the dignity . 	1
PE	5922	Anyone who wants to achieve the goal should acknowledge that his effort and experience from suffering helps him understand his true potential and increase his strength , and ultimately , it will prompt him to be ready for overcoming the greater challenge in his life . 	1
PE	5923	So that , government should invest to create more jobs . 	1
PE	5924	Consequently , quality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy . 	0
PE	5925	Therefore , in my opinion , I accede with notion that government should pay attention on basic needs of people first . 	1
PE	5926	Thus , these technologies mean nothing if people lack of prosperity . 	0
PE	5927	Although developing technologies to discover amazing thing in galaxy is interesting , there are many people in the world are in poverty or starvation . 	0
PE	5928	Governments should spend money on space exploration or for basic needs of people 	0
PE	5929	There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities . 	0
PE	5930	When people did not have money , They had to rob other people . 	0
PE	5931	Then , many people did not have money . 	0
PE	5932	First , as you can see that after great economic recession , many people in many countries were unemployed . 	0
PE	5933	In spite of this , the disadvantages of the promotion of a universal language cannot be denied . 	0
PE	5934	To be more specific , a single international language may , to some extent , erode the cultural identity of a nation . 	1
PE	5935	This is because people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language , eroding a sense of national belong . 	0
PE	5936	Recently , there has been a social concern in regards to whether mobile phones have a negative effect in our social communication . 	0
PE	5937	Mobile phone ; " Iron man " / " Weichat " - destroy social interactions ? 	0
PE	5938	However , as far as I am concerned , I strongly agree with the view that this great invention causes many social problems . 	1
PE	5939	Indeed , mobile phones have been widely used for people of all ages , bringing convenience and entertainment into our life . 	0
PE	5940	In the first place , as people increasingly tend to focus and relay on phones , they may lose their interest on daily activities like meeting with their friends so that distraction may be developed during study or social activities . 	0
PE	5941	In the first place , spending too much time on phones may exert adverse effects on social life . 	1
PE	5942	Furthermore , there are many types of games available in the phone and many of them are very aggressive in nature such as " Iron man " . 	0
PE	5943	Moreover , continuous use of mobile phone may damage both eyesight and physical posture of the children . 	0
PE	5944	For instance , many games involve children helping their character to kill or shoot , which many lead to increased aggressive feelings , thoughts and behaviours . 	0
PE	5945	In those games , children are rewarded for being more violent , and this violence is repeated again and again . 	0
PE	5946	It enriches people ' s knowledge with worldwide information . 	0
PE	5947	It also positively affects the way people live in many other aspects . 	0
PE	5948	This is particularly essential when the globalization process has been permeating into all areas of society . 	0
PE	5949	Indeed , the fast growth of news media is helpful for people worldwide . 	0
PE	5950	In conclusion , the development of news media has been making great inroads into the lives of all people . 	1
PE	5951	It relaxes people with plentiful entertainment news . 	0
PE	5952	Obviously , the popularity of news media is beneficial to human beings . 	1
PE	5953	In addition to this , news media help people broaden their knowledge . 	1
PE	5954	It is clearly seen that mass media provide people with a variety of global news on all fields , including political situation , economic change , global warming , and so forth . 	0
PE	5955	Hence , there is a strong likelihood that today people are able to know the world better . 	0
PE	5956	For example , if an engineer needs to make a project , but he needs to deliver it tomorrow , he could save hours preparing a food with the microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch . 	0
PE	5957	Secondly , when someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason , some time ago he / she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food , but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food . 	1
PE	5958	Some good reasons are about having more time and being able to prepare better food without being a good cook . 	0
PE	5959	Firstly , people normally have lots of things to do . 	0
PE	5960	Because of that , they don ’ t have much time to spend in the kitchen . 	0
PE	5961	But being able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome . 	1
PE	5962	Easy preparation of food leads to a better life 	0
PE	5963	The Technology has developed a lot . 	0
PE	5964	With that development , food can be prepared more easily and it can taste a lot better than it used to . 	0
PE	5965	With that change , people ’ s lives are a lot better for several reasons . 	0
PE	5966	Furthermore , the preservation of old buildings is also a ways to conserve our culture and everyone can learn much from them . 	0
PE	5967	Old buildings should be used as the culture museums and provide accommodation with more convenient for people who live there . 	1
PE	5968	. 	0
PE	5969	Many cities have development strategies as a city contains both unique and modern beauty , and that preservation help to finish half of work . 	1
PE	5970	Overall , both of those view have strong arguments : the need for housing or the expense of restoration contrast with our desire to conserve culture and attract tourism . 	0
PE	5971	So I think we should restore those building because old buildings process the most outstanding feature of areas which contain them . 	1
PE	5972	Other than that , they have other critical obligations to take , in order to make our society function in an ordered way . 	1
PE	5973	In conclusion , it is a significant obligation of citizens to pay tax to the government . 	0
PE	5974	So it is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities , by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department . 	0
PE	5975	There are criminals in every society , and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited . 	0
PE	5976	Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force . 	0
PE	5977	In such case , aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial , which are a great complement to government support . 	0
PE	5978	It is true that the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties , but such financial help is usually far from enough . 	0
PE	5979	Leisure activities are one of them and I myself choose outdoor activities to spend my leisure time . 	1
PE	5980	There ' s no doubt that indoor activities like reading a book , watching TV or listening to music can bring us lots of joy . 	0
PE	5981	Admittedly , indoor activities are fun . 	1
PE	5982	After all , people are people and we have our own propensity . 	0
PE	5983	Although I can also have fun in indoor activities , this advantage cannot outweigh the attractions coming from outdoor activities . 	1
PE	5984	Moreover , you can also enjoy the beautiful nature when doing some outdoor activities like going hiking , sunbathing , going biking . 	1
PE	5985	If , for example , I hadn ' t participate in that camping , I wouldn ' t have had many friends like today . 	0
PE	5986	Spending time outdoors , people can breathe fresh air , feel the warm sun on their face and enjoy the complete peace that only nature brings . 	1
PE	5987	If you spend your spare time at home or something like that , you can ' t enjoy beautiful nature . 	0
PE	5988	Second , not all of serious movies are boring . 	0
PE	5989	" Click " is a very interesting comedy , with a serious approach about the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses . 	0
PE	5990	Serious or entertaining movies 	0
PE	5991	I prefer the serious movies which are simple , touching and powerful . 	1
PE	5992	Here are my reasons . 	0
PE	5993	First , most serious movies have a wide variety of content . 	1
PE	5994	Entertaining movies are created to amuse people . 	0
PE	5995	However , most entertaining movies are empty and nonsensical . 	0
PE	5996	Compared with the entertainment film , the serious film may be more worthwhile and meaningful . 	0
PE	5997	Serious movies usually designed to express one or more thinking about love , humaneness ; moreover , it may point out the dark sides of the society . 	0
PE	5998	Therefore , judging a person by his income is difficult , especially in the success aspect . 	1
PE	5999	On the other hand , the fact of knowing a man ' s utilization of his money remains in the dark . 	0
PE	6000	Yet , it is the common scene that a man can be publicly considered successful when his achievements , which can only accomplished by passion , dedication and ethics , are helpful not only for himself . 	0
PE	6001	In conclusion , using only money as a scale to measure a man ' s success is impossible despite the fact that it is the essential in basic needs . 	1
PE	6002	To conclude , I strongly believe that universities must open choice for everyone to select his subject . 	1
PE	6003	" Save the planet Earth " is a common line which can be read and heard all over the world . 	0
PE	6004	More , even if family members who are in different countries , they also can use the Internet to connect each others , especially though the images or videos , they can feel close . 	0
PE	6005	Instead of using letters , technology advanced not only gives us more spare time but also convenient and efficient . 	0
PE	6006	While public use the Internet or smart phone to share information to each other at different positions . 	0
PE	6007	The main advantage is that technology has enabled people stay in contact with each other more closely . 	1
PE	6008	However , I strongly agree with that the technology has large positive effects on relationships between people . 	1
PE	6009	As technology develops , it has negative influences in many respects . 	0
PE	6010	Nowadays , the variety of communication systems used widely . 	0
PE	6011	Man to man interaction changed 	0
PE	6012	Another issue is that in the ever-accelerated updating of science and technology , technology provides opportunities for people to establish the social network . 	0
PE	6013	Furthermore , technology is also essential for students , live in remote districts , shared the valuable natural resources with friends . 	0
PE	6014	Despite the argument of some people that learners can obtain more useful knowledge from teachers than from other sources , I firmly believe that both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children ' s acquisition of knowledge . 	1
PE	6015	It is undeniable that the widespread of alternative sources of knowledge has played an important role in students ' acquisition of knowledge . 	0
PE	6016	Teachers lesson vs other sources 	0
PE	6017	The way in which children today study is radically different from any previous generations , and the increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology has been instrumental in this change . 	0
PE	6018	Moreover , when students have some academic problems , they can post those to some websites and receive correct answers from unknown people in faraway places without any costs . 	0
PE	6019	Arts and public services are both important to the community and should be invested properly 	0
PE	6020	Computers can be programmed to provide an endless numbers of questions in diverse range of fields , and as the students answer these questions , the facts has been learned and reinforced . 	0
PE	6021	A case in point is the reading and listening parts of TOEFL iBT exams , as candidates have to answer many questions in a limited period of time . 	0
PE	6022	Thus , technologies are vital in students ' learning . 	1
PE	6023	There has been wide opinion that Government should invest more money on public services rather than arts such as music and theatre . 	0
PE	6024	On the other hand , if professors are busy in doing research , ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students , it would ruin the reputation of universities . 	0
PE	6025	Students are unsatisfied with the unprepared course , and the enrollment of universities may decline . 	0
PE	6026	Many students would not choose these kinds of universities to study . 	0
PE	6027	In this way , hardly can professors find assistants to help with projects . 	0
PE	6028	It is adverse to the whole academic field . 	0
PE	6029	Accordingly , spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors , rather than research . 	1
PE	6030	On the other hand , some people oppose the argument , saying it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society , since a great number of people , in fact , have had the capacity to pay for the both privately . 	1
PE	6031	Therefore , the government should be accountable for citizens ' health care and education to keep society safe and stable . 	1
PE	6032	Through to use the equipment and invent their own work , they may get more experience in the process of research . 	0
PE	6033	For instance , electronic students always invent new machines such as robots , MP3 and remote control car . 	0
PE	6034	If citizens had no access to health care and education , their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk . 	0
PE	6035	This is because citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment , which should be enabled by the government , the leader of the society . 	0
PE	6036	Some people argue that it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens . 	0
PE	6037	And a much debated issue these days is whether or not the government should be responsible for citizens ' health care and education . 	0
PE	6038	Despite the development of modern society , the health care and education still remain the basic rights of citizens . 	0
PE	6039	Government should be responsible for education and health care or not ? 	0
PE	6040	Personally speaking , it is unfair for passive smokers because they do not smoke but they have same health risks as the active one . 	1
PE	6041	Stroke , heart disorders , hearing loss , and cancers are some diseases that can attack passive smokers . 	0
PE	6042	When they are around the active smokers , they will inhale hazardous smoke . 	0
PE	6043	Last but not least , passive smokers will have a lot of health risks . 	0
PE	6044	The most dangerous people that would be affected by smoke are the pregnant women because they will breathe in the contaminated air and it will disrupt the growth of the babies . 	0
PE	6045	Smoking in restaurants also can affect the elders ' health , especially if they have problems with their hearts and lungs . 	1
PE	6046	Children have a high potential to imitate what adults do because they have really high curiosity towards something . 	0
PE	6047	Smoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children . 	1
PE	6048	State laws that prohibit it should be upheld so the restaurant ' management can make a clear rule in their restaurants because everyone has a right to enjoy their meals . 	0
PE	6049	In conclusion , smoking should not be permitted in restaurants because there will be a lot of people get disadvantaged . 	1
PE	6050	Educational rights must be given to both genders . 	0
PE	6051	Choice of course should be the discretion of the student and their merit , irrespective of the gender . 	0
PE	6052	Another reason is that from part time jobs students can earn money , which can help their parents . 	1
PE	6053	This experience taught me , doing part time job can help students to learn many things . 	0
PE	6054	I taught math to two kids of my neighbor . 	0
PE	6055	For instance , when i was in high school I worked as a home tutor . 	0
PE	6056	Moreover , I learn money management . 	0
PE	6057	This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively . 	0
PE	6058	From this i learned , how to manage money correctly . 	0
PE	6059	When my boss was out of the shop , i had to manage the accounts section of the shop . 	0
PE	6060	By tutoring them , i earned some money and bought me books with it . 	0
PE	6061	I helped them to understand the difficult topics of the books . 	0
PE	6062	A recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign , the sales revenue would increase by 40% , which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic . 	0
PE	6063	That is not to say , however , that advertisements have no downsides . 	0
PE	6064	First , it is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring . 	1
PE	6065	In fact , they are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture , good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor . 	0
PE	6066	Besides , it is obvious that publicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies . 	1
PE	6067	In a larger sense , it could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country . 	0
PE	6068	Should all the advertisements be banned ? 	0
PE	6069	Never in history was advertising industry so developed as in modern society and it has led to some adverse sentiments in public because some deliver exaggerated and fake information . 	0
PE	6070	Hence whether we should ban all the advertisements or not has aroused much controversy of the public . 	0
PE	6071	My view is that while some of them are disturbing , we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring . 	1
PE	6072	Secondly , most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns , especially in some countries where guns are available for people . 	1
PE	6073	So the fewer guns possessed , the fewer accidents would happened , our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates . 	1
PE	6074	Therefore , this is still a controversial topic around the world . 	0
PE	6075	However , gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others . 	0
PE	6076	Gun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society , which is strictly controlled in most countries . 	0
PE	6077	Gun control 	0
PE	6078	For example , we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting . 	0
PE	6079	The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns . 	0
PE	6080	The first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns . 	0
PE	6081	From my point of view , it is sensible to enforce the gun control . 	1
PE	6082	Undoubtedly , math , language , science and history are all extremely important subjects in student ' s education since these subjects provide students the basic understanding of the world . 	0
PE	6083	Younger school children should study art and music 	0
PE	6084	Nevertheless , the art and music , from my point of view , are also essential for younger student ' s future life because those subjects help students learn this planet from another perspective and they can release people from the enormous pressure nowadays . 	1
PE	6085	Therefore , some people assert that there is no need to learn other subjects for younger students . 	0
PE	6086	First of all , art and music would broaden student ' s horizon and therefore make them thoughtful . 	1
PE	6087	In this case , I would definitely agree that the art and music should be required to study . 	1
PE	6088	Under this circumstance , learning art and music enables students to appreciate the fruits of eminent artists and musicians and to feel the fascination of different cultures . 	0
PE	6089	It is well known that the art and music are not bound by country border , and they are something that is shared by the people from every parts of this world and is symbols of various cultures . 	0
PE	6090	For instance , students are able to feel the greatest music masterpiece in Euopren as the symphony of destiny-Beethoven ' s most notable workpiece is played . 	0
PE	6091	Ergo , opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime . 	0
PE	6092	However , one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences . 	0
PE	6093	In short , these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers . 	1
PE	6094	In the event of an argument , the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken . 	0
PE	6095	Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras . 	1
PE	6096	Looking from another perspective , the use of CCTV cameras does cause controversy . 	0
PE	6097	Furthermore , at some offices , employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers . 	0
PE	6098	Thus , it is clear that CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized . 	1
PE	6099	Hence , the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded . 	0
PE	6100	At times , face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger . 	0
PE	6101	In this complex society , we , young people , are encompassed with multiple tasks , so the ability to plan and organize is undoubtedly a powerful and sharp weapon that we must be armed with . 	1
PE	6102	It is obviously a huge waste of time . 	0
PE	6103	But if they make their plan in the first place , and then stick to their plans , they could get their work done quickly beyond their imagination . 	0
PE	6104	In the past , teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard , resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers . 	0
PE	6105	Second , technology also makes teaching simpler . 	1
PE	6106	Believe it or not , nowadays people are always confronted with a problem that whether technology makes their life simpler or not , thus making them confused . 	0
PE	6107	Technology makes people ' s lives simpler rather than complicated 	0
PE	6108	Although I conceded technology may make people ' s life complicated in some aspects , the convenience it brings is more . 	1
PE	6109	Many people advocate that technology makes their life easier . 	0
PE	6110	First , when it comes to the field of transportation , there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people ' s life simpler . 	1
PE	6111	In what follows , I will illustrate my point of view . 	0
PE	6112	Alternatively , if you would like to have a trip across the ocean , a plane can carry you there in only a few hours , which is hard to imagine in the ancient times . 	0
PE	6113	With a private car , you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle . 	0
PE	6114	While many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation , I strongly disagree with this notion . 	1
PE	6115	However , cars themselves , especially private ones , have exerted severe pressure on the environment and economy for wasteful oil consumption . 	0
PE	6116	There is no doubt our life has had a change for the better since cars were introduced . 	0
PE	6117	Increased taxation on petrol and diesel fuel to discourage private cars ? 	0
PE	6118	However , taxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation . 	0
PE	6119	Additionally , for those who have already afforded a car , there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities . 	0
PE	6120	Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains , buses or ferries . 	1
PE	6121	One can not deny the fact that if petrol and fuel taxation are raised , people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile . 	0
PE	6122	Consequently , people have to turn to cheaper alternatives , which might cause the abundance in goods and later on , economic crisis . 	1
PE	6123	To be precise , the more costly petrol is , the higher the price of necessary product : rice , meat or even vegetable . 	0
PE	6124	Todays life has some difficulty which become comfortable with the help of industry . 	0
PE	6125	Therefore , some lands should be assigned to industry . 	1
PE	6126	I would maintain that nowadays humans need farmland , housing and industry because of increasing population are more important than saving land for endangered animals . 	1
PE	6127	To conclude , the population of endangered animals are less than people ' s population , so they do not need so much land that people need . 	1
PE	6128	First , making college education free would cost too much . 	1
PE	6129	However , I believe that individuals should pay their college tuition because it would cost too much , the college education is a personal ' s choice , and there are many ways to fund a college education . 	1
PE	6130	Some people believe that the government should cover the college tuitions and expenses for any citizen who wants to go to a college . 	0
PE	6131	Should the Government Provide Free College ? 	0
PE	6132	Consequently , it would affect all taxpayers whether or not they benefit from the use of the funds . 	0
PE	6133	In addition , it would cause to raise our taxes again and again to fund college education . 	0
PE	6134	There are many other needs which should come first , such as providing health care to all American , or improving public schools . 	0
PE	6135	It would divert public funds from other needs such as law enforcement , infrastructure and so forth . 	0
PE	6136	Not everyone wants to go to a college . 	0
PE	6137	Second , it is a personal choice to go to a college . 	0
PE	6138	We should make full use of the past , instead of ignoring it , for a better and brighter future . 	0
PE	6139	How can the comtemporary scientists study the earth ' s gravity without the apple which fall on Newton ' s head . 	0
PE	6140	They are only some of many precious knowledge that the past presents us . 	0
PE	6141	We cannot ignore them in any way . 	0
PE	6142	All in all , the past ' s mistakes , success and knowledge all have crucial impact on people ' s lives today . 	1
PE	6143	For instance , Edison ' s statement " Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration " is still helpful for everyone today , and probably in the future . 	0
PE	6144	Last but not least , the past is the basis in which people can use to develope new knowledge , inventions . 	1
PE	6145	If it had not been for those knowledge in the past , we could never be as modern as today . 	0
PE	6146	How can America be the world ' s leading country if Columbus did not accidentally discover it in his search for India . 	0
PE	6147	Therefore , companies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation . 	1
PE	6148	To sum up , TV may take some of your time away from your family and friends but it can also make family get together and help to get in conversation . 	1
PE	6149	As well as it ' s one way of recent communications , based on that I think TV helps you to get connected with people . 	1
PE	6150	Moreover , TV can be connected to multimedia devices that have smart operating system like Google TV , WDTV using Skype , tango and other apps . 	0
PE	6151	In addition Teenagers can play games online with their friends ; therefore we can communicate with each other through TV . 	1
PE	6152	It was fun and a little bit similar to the cinema . 	0
PE	6153	Third , TV can be one of communication ways . 	0
PE	6154	However , if those with exaggerated and fake information could be banned , advertisements would be welcomed by more . 	0
PE	6155	Taken all together , advertisements have its social responsibility and contribute to economic growth . 	1
PE	6156	We can not deny all of them . 	0
PE	6157	Of course , the advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information , creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies . 	1
PE	6158	Yet , its merits still outweigh these downsides . 	0
PE	6159	It is targeted for children to teenager . 	0
PE	6160	For example , in Korea , there ' s program called EBS . 	0
PE	6161	However , I strongly believe that television has more positive effects than negative effects . 	1
PE	6162	Many people say that television has negative effects on children , since it can be violent or inappropriate for children . 	0
PE	6163	Nowadays , we have undergone many technology innovations such as Tv . 	0
PE	6164	Tv has NO negative effects on children 	0
PE	6165	If children can use those programs wisely , they can learn many information from it . 	0
PE	6166	Not only the up-to-date news , but also there are many programs which has educational purposes . 	0
PE	6167	First of all , television has useful and educational programs . 	1
PE	6168	There are two reasons to support my idea . 	0
PE	6169	In my opinion , one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons . 	1
PE	6170	While some students study and live overseas to achieve this , some prefer to study home because of the difficulties of living and studying overseas . 	0
PE	6171	As a result , the project cannot being done . 	0
PE	6172	In condition , doing all jobs alone makes employees fall asleep easily . 	0
PE	6173	The other reason is that great success requires taking great risks . 	1
PE	6174	There are always interesting and useful experiences that successful people can learn them only by trying new things . 	0
PE	6175	For example , if you want to know how to act effectively when communicating with people , you can try something new like salesmanship in various stores and places . 	0
PE	6176	By selling goods or other commodities you will face different people with different behaviors and personalities and as a result you will learn how to behave people in different situations and jobs in the future . 	0
PE	6177	Successful people try new things and take risks 	0
PE	6178	I have my own reasons why I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks . 	0
PE	6179	There are many viewpoints regarding what the main characteristics of successful people are . 	0
PE	6180	Fatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child ' s life starting from the the birth 	0
PE	6181	These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can ’ t be always found in books . 	1
PE	6182	I do believe that great success requires taking great risks . 	0
PE	6183	During my all vacations , I used to miss my school due to which I used to restart my session with great enthusiasm of learning and scoring good marks in new quarter . 	0
PE	6184	If I work for other people , I have to give my ideas to employers cheaply . 	0
PE	6185	Which is better - Learning foreign language in home or host country ? 	0
PE	6186	As a result , they lit the light for the poor and victims ; in addition , they could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world . 	0
PE	6187	For the above reasons and examples , it could be widely thought that groups or organizations are a vital part for us in plenty of aspects in different ages and in different backgrounds . 	1
PE	6188	Our World has varied cultures and each culture has its own language . 	0
PE	6189	Also , I think its better that people learn foreign language in their own country . 	1
PE	6190	The reasons for holding that opinion are illustrated in the subsequent paragraphs . 	0
PE	6191	First of all , it is not possible for everyone to visit a foreign country to learn a foreign language as it requires large amount of money and legal formalities . 	1
PE	6192	In the earlier periods , it was not easy to find a teacher to learn a foreign languge . 	0
PE	6193	But with the advent of globalization , one can easily find a teacher in their own country . 	1
PE	6194	After all , charity organisations are mainly funded by the home country thus there is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected . 	0
PE	6195	Despite the importance of helping those beyond our national borders , it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens . 	1
PE	6196	By solving the problems in the home country , it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth . 	0
PE	6197	Another reason is that , even within the most developed countries , there are still poor people who lack their basic needs . 	0
PE	6198	In conclusion , people from unfortunate countries need more international assistance while helping citizens in the home country is also necessary . 	1
PE	6199	But to me , learning about life through personal experience seems more appropriate . 	1
PE	6200	In summary , each way learning life has its own benefits . 	0
PE	6201	However , flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy . 	1
PE	6202	Holiday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions , but also pay for food , accommodation , transportation and entertainment . 	0
PE	6203	With this convenient and versatile facility , students can improve their learning condition . 	0
PE	6204	For instance , folks have to check their Facebooks , Twitters , and Forums accounts every minute , which add too much pressure to them . 	0
PE	6205	I favor the former ; that is , I prefer to spend money on improving facilities . 	1
PE	6206	I disagree with this view . 	0
PE	6207	For example , library is a good place for students to study or research . 	0
PE	6208	They can concentrate on the subjects with a tranquil ambience ; also , there are a lot of references for students to utilize . 	0
PE	6209	Tourism also creates more pollution and waste , including growing emission of greenhouse gases , dumped leftovers and overuse of water , power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels . 	0
PE	6210	There is a hotly debated issue over whether universities should spend money on improving facilities is more than hiring famous teachers , and this topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity . 	0
PE	6211	I admit that tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment . 	1
PE	6212	After deeply pondering over this issue , I develop my own perspective as well . 	0
PE	6213	It can influence us in different aspects of life . 	0
PE	6214	In conclusion , studying abroad does not only have advantages , but also can change us in a very positive way . 	1
PE	6215	Both genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior . 	0
PE	6216	It would affect students ' mental health to study in the environment of single gender . 	0
PE	6217	In conclusion , it is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls , and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject . 	1
PE	6218	For example , a girl , who is interested in literature , is arranged into an engineering department , but she is unlikely to focus on her subject , and this also can block the girl ' s future development and career prospect . 	0
PE	6219	People who cannot afford to pay their tuition benefit from the scholarship , financial aids , and other funds . 	0
PE	6220	Third , there are many ways to fund a college education . 	1
PE	6221	Therefore , those people should make the financial investment in their own choice ; not the government . 	1
PE	6222	People who want to make more money , and live a better life than other people decide to take a college education . 	0
PE	6223	While the money is not given to individual students , these contributions are not trivial . 	0
PE	6224	They also provide funds for academic research . 	0
PE	6225	They often provide services such as fire departments , medical assistance , and police protection for the schools and their students . 	0
PE	6226	In addition , the government already helps pay college expense through indirect means . 	0
PE	6227	Otherwise , it would cause too much cost from taxpayers and the government . 	1
PE	6228	In short , the individual should finance his or her education because it is a personal choice . 	1
PE	6229	Moreover , children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills , they will know little about the outside life . 	0
PE	6230	It is a well-known fact that people who are addicted to games , especially online games , can eventually bear dangerous consequences . 	1
PE	6231	First , using computer constantly has bad influence on children ' s eyes . 	1
PE	6232	When they concentrate on computer for too long , their eyes will get tired , which is the main reason for some eyes problems , typically shortsighted . 	0
PE	6233	Some people think that computer is good for children and it should be used daily by children but some others think differently . 	0
PE	6234	In my opinion , the latter opinion is true . 	0
PE	6235	Computer has negative effects to children 	0
PE	6236	Nowadays , thanks to the development of technology , computer is now indispensable to life . 	0
PE	6237	For instance , several teenagers play games without rest , which leads to health depression , a typical example is the death of Korean gamer , who had a non-stop playing for 3 days . 	0
PE	6238	Finally , even people who are not interested in online game can still be negatively affected by using computer too much . 	1
PE	6239	In conclusion , I totally disagree with this statement that teachers should be paid by how much their students learn because teacher could not pay attention to each students in class . 	1
PE	6240	Besides , learning abilities of student are different . 	1
PE	6241	In conclusion , the time-saving , simple food preparation process gives us more time to do other activities , more chance to select diverse kinds of foods and more willingness to cook meals . 	1
PE	6242	Of course , there may be some other perspectives that I neglected to fully consider . 	0
PE	6243	More men , on the other hand , are willing to participate in cooking that they had never done before . 	0
PE	6244	This transformation may bring positive impacts to family in some cases . 	1
PE	6245	Nevertheless , for the reasons that I have presented above , I would assert that this change has improved our life significantly . 	1
PE	6246	If people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying , they can stares in their workplace . 	0
PE	6247	For example , I have a friend who was working so slowly . 	0
PE	6248	I am totally agrees with the statement for some reasons . 	0
PE	6249	Trying to learn skills , working in two places in a week and gaining more tasks are the reasons which take into account as the most important causes of my choice . 	1
PE	6250	To begin with , if persons work rapidly , they will have more chance to study . 	1
PE	6251	Attending in some classes which try to increase the skills of employees can be considered as an absolutely effective parameter . 	0
PE	6252	More important to work quickly and risk making mistakes 	0
PE	6253	Organizations , these days , seek to find people who can work extraordinary fast and carefully . 	0
PE	6254	These people play an important role to increase effectiveness of a company . 	0
PE	6255	Working fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal mentioned before . 	1
PE	6256	The reasons are the followings . 	0
PE	6257	Capitalism enfranchised people ' s right to own properties , and consequently , their rights to use them . 	0
PE	6258	Driving cars during the rush hours might is bound to polluting cities ' s environment , but laws protect drivers to do so , and accordingly , charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction . 	1
PE	6259	From another point of view , traffic jam is a natural phenomenon that nobody is able to shun or ban ; so it is out of drivers ' control . 	0
PE	6260	Drivers have to pay a fee for driving in Rush Hour 	0
PE	6261	Started in the late eighteenth century , the industrialization and urbanization witnessed the explosion in number of automobiles . 	0
PE	6262	The very fuel that they rely on , oil , has now become the dominant pollution of cities ' environment . 	0
PE	6263	While critics castigating about the exorbitant use of oil and other insisting to charged drivers with extra fee during the rush hours for their selfish conducts , I hold the contention that no additional payment should be charged on them . 	1
PE	6264	Why drivers should pay a fine only for driving their own cars in a particular time ? 	0
PE	6265	Wars are notorious , but you can ' t blame the soldiers who are justing fight for their countries . 	0
PE	6266	Second , public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems . 	1
PE	6267	Averagely , public transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars . 	0
PE	6268	In the contrary , if the public transportation is efficiently used , the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower . 	0
PE	6269	And this definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource , gasoline . 	0
PE	6270	Cars depend on gasoline , which is a non-renewable resource . 	0
PE	6271	Therefore , the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up . 	0
PE	6272	In my opinion , governments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system because it would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating . 	1
PE	6273	First , the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation . 	1
PE	6274	Improve roads or public transports 	0
PE	6275	Many people think that governments should spend money on improving roads and highways while the others say that it would be better to spend money on public transportation . 	0
PE	6276	For instance , tourists are given the brochures about the local traditions and customs before they visit the place . 	0
PE	6277	On the other hand , in order to avoid the conflicts between foreigners and locals , people are trying to understand different culture and find solutions . 	1
PE	6278	I agree with both opinions that international tourism not only causes tension but also leads to understanding between people from different culture , because most people will be trying to understand each other after they have conflict or debates . 	1
PE	6279	International tourism leads to both - tension and understanding 	0
PE	6280	Firstly , some people leave the rubbish after visiting the attractions . 	0
PE	6281	There is no doubt that some behaviors of the tourists are not welcome in the local area . 	1
PE	6282	Moreover , tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background . 	0
PE	6283	Therefore , those local residents have to clean the place frequently so that the new batch of tourists will have a tidy and neat environment . 	0
PE	6284	Thus , if tourists want to respect the tradition , they will not order any beef in the local restaurant . 	0
PE	6285	For example , Indians don ' t eat beef since they worship cows . 	0
PE	6286	These two art forms not only provide the public with entertainment but also contribute significantly to the economy . 	0
PE	6287	The income of film and music industries produce millions of dollars each year for the Goverment , for instance K-pop and Hollywood , and these industries can not survive without goverment ' s financial assistance . 	0
PE	6288	But our standard of living also depend on another factor - spiritual life which is related closely with arts . 	1
PE	6289	Arts include many forms and music as well as cinema are the most typical . 	0
PE	6290	Investing in hospitals helps improve people ' s health , also , in schools assists with raising our children ' s education level . 	0
PE	6291	Apparently if these facilities were not spent adequately , our standard of living would deteriorate . 	0
PE	6292	However , in my perspective , both public services and arts worth investment . 	1
PE	6293	It is obvious axiomatic that indispensable public services like hospital and school worth every penny investing . 	1
PE	6294	As can be seen from this , is that a hurried decision is almost never a good one . 	1
PE	6295	That ' s why one should always study his decision carefully and slowly , to ensure that the decision that the person is making is the best for him . 	0
PE	6296	In this case , the child would imitate the actor ' s behaviors in order to look like to him . 	0
PE	6297	In addition , computers can do most difficult tasks which leads to make life easier . 	0
PE	6298	By considering all reasons , advantages of computers outweigh disadvantages . 	1
PE	6299	Moreover , even when people watch television together , there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television . 	1
PE	6300	Watching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone . 	0
PE	6301	Thus , it is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness . 	0
PE	6302	To illustrate my point , it is reported that most of people don ' t converse with their family when they are watching television together . 	0
PE	6303	It is natural they behave in that way because television shows don ' t require any participation . 	0
PE	6304	In conclusion , I firmly believe that it is detrimental to communication among members in group , family or friends or whatever , to sit in front of television and just stare forward . 	1
PE	6305	It is because television not only makes people be obsessed with it but also makes their mouth close . 	1
PE	6306	Thus , unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child ’ s behaviors . 	1
PE	6307	For example , in Indian sub-continent there are large number of centers opened for getting trained in variety of languages like french , german etc . Second , colleges and universities have introduced foreign language course as a part of their curriculum . 	0
PE	6308	Students can choose any language from the set of languages available at a university . 	0
PE	6309	But the benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points . 	0
PE	6310	All in all , the university should allow the student to participate in the classed without passing the test because not only is every students expert in every part of one subject but also it will reduce the student in the campus who leave uncultivated . 	1
PE	6311	In the end , this student will become a loser in the world . 	0
PE	6312	And all this is due to that the university don ' t permit them to attend the class . 	0
PE	6313	This is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system . 	0
PE	6314	Admittedly , the university student may don ' t reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not . 	1
PE	6315	They do not undergo any pain or misery . 	0
PE	6316	Why do not we have other wisely punishments ? 	0
PE	6317	As we can see some industries such as mining , oil and gas extraction , reclamation , etc , needs many labors . 	0
PE	6318	Why do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country - it is better . 	0
PE	6319	Moreover , rehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts . 	0
PE	6320	To conclude , capital punishment is a form of legalized revenge , it is an easy way for serious crimes , and nobody has rights to take others life ; thus , it neither demines crimes of violence nor be essential to control violence in society . 	1
PE	6321	The world should consider clearly about polishing the law of the dead penalty . 	1
PE	6322	For instance , my older brother has got married and lived independently for two years but when he faces difficulties in his work or his life , he comes back to meet our parents and ask for advice . 	0
PE	6323	To conclude , I strongly believe that parents are our best teachers . 	1
PE	6324	Also , being caged in the zoos for long render wildlife lost the ability to survive in nature where is full of cruel competition among various animals . 	0
PE	6325	In order to protect animals , from my perspective , zoos offer a good man-made environment which could prolong the life span of wild animals and cultivate the notion of protecting animals . 	1
PE	6326	What the zoos should do is improvement of the management system and use the income wisely in preserving wild animals better . 	0
PE	6327	When children pay a visit to the zoos , they still could observe the eating behavior or leisure activities among animals , which would definitely enrich their knowledge associated with different animals . 	0
PE	6328	Further , children could acquire the information regarding how to protect wild animals according to guided tour or volunteers . 	0
PE	6329	On the other hand , complained about the drawbacks of zoos are often heard . 	1
PE	6330	It is true that some zoos are lack of systematic management which attributes to numerous wild animals die because of food shortage . 	0
PE	6331	I think when we leave school , maybe we will forget parts of the lessons we learn at school if we do not experience them in life , but I strongly believe we will never forget what our parents have taught us because we use it every day . 	1
PE	6332	For example , I believe I will never forget what my parents told me about how to be grateful to other people who help me . 	0
PE	6333	The fact that a company is a large one , this means that it ' s having a considerable success . 	0
PE	6334	Second , I think that a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one . 	1
PE	6335	Thirdly , I totally believe parents love their sons or daughters unconditionally . 	0
PE	6336	Companies vary from small to large ones based on the context , success and needs of their work . 	0
PE	6337	Some people prefer to work for a large company 	0
PE	6338	I personally prefer to work for a large company for several reasons . 	1
PE	6339	Small companies usually have a local job in the area , while large companies work in an international context providing for the entire nation or even for other foreign countries . 	0
PE	6340	Large companies always look for new skilled employees to fill in their need of distributing , managing and selling their products in different countries . 	0
PE	6341	First , to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company . 	1
PE	6342	In other words , Large company equals more job opportunity . 	0
PE	6343	For example , if a large company decides to open a branch in a foreign country , they would need more employees in that country to work there . 	0
WD	6344	However , I think that the evaluation / decision needs to weigh the impact that inclusion will have on the class as a whole . . . not just whether it ' s good for that one child . . . . because , imo , inclusion to benefit 1 at the expense of others is wrong . 	1
WD	6345	Public school teachers make more money than private school teachers . 	0
WD	6346	I understand & support the desire of parents to have their dcs , regardless of abilities ( high or low ) , in the most beneficial educational environment possible and I know that I made some broad statements / gave examples that obviously doesn ' t apply to every inclusion situation . 	0
WD	6347	I do agree with others who said inclusion does need to be done / evaluated on an individual basis . 	0
WD	6348	ed kid w / the same inclusion student if it feels that doing so is beneficial to the inclusion student without discussing with the parents of the reg . 	0
WD	6349	ed . child whether doing so is desired by them & beneficial for their child . 	0
WD	6350	The fact of the matter is that doing so ( calming down a student ) is not their job or their responsibility . 	0
WD	6351	Some schools , though , such as my dcs ' , will repeatedly place a reg . 	0
WD	6352	Honestly there are likely a lot more people that feel the way I do it ' s just not something popular to speak out about here . 	0
WD	6353	But in general , I don ' t think I could ever be convinced that it ' s " wrong " for me to be anti-homeschool . 	0
WD	6354	The best musicians tend to make the most money . 	0
WD	6355	In addition he adds that single-sex education for boys would allow adequate time for male maturation and would benefit the boys by giving them more structure and discipline due to their tendencies of restlessness and aggression ( Mael , 1998 ) It seems clear that single-sex education advocates have done their research and that it does make sense that girls and boys being separated would foster an environment of non-stereotyping and encourage learning . 	0
WD	6356	Thus my lack of surprise to learn that public school students outperform private school students on a level playing field and that public schools and their teachers are more open to innovations and trying new learning techniques . 	0
WD	6357	On the other hand , it can work in the girls ' favour if they do run the class with a teacher and its a very small group . 	0
WD	6358	How long until other religions start demanding similar accommodation for their superstitions ? 	0
WD	6359	来いは戦争 	0
WD	6360	Forget the obscene fact that Beyonce makes about 200 times what the concertmaster for the New York Philharmonic does , they both do quite well when compared to the average piano teacher who gives lessons through the Jewish Community Center or the YMCA . 	0
WD	6361	You have to agree to not frown upon them not participating in group prayer . 	0
WD	6362	If schools would agree to this , then why not ? 	0
WD	6363	If we allow Christian students to pray , you must allow Wiccan students to pray , Jewish , Islamic , Muslim . 	0
WD	6364	You have to allow ALL of them to pray and wear their religious symbols . 	0
WD	6365	The best accountants tend to make the most money . 	0
WD	6366	Will the Muslim clerics claim the right to punish girls that fail to sit at their rear during their period ? 	0
WD	6367	The best writers — business and entertainment — tend to make the most money . 	0
WD	6368	Isn ' t permitting Muslim prayer in public schools a significant step onto the slippery slope towards applying Sharia Law ? 	0
WD	6369	Now I ’ m not saying that Alex Rodriguez deserves to make more money than Miguel Cabrera , but that they and every other professional ball player make a lot more money than minor leaguers , those in foreign leagues , semi-pros and beer league softballers . 	0
WD	6370	Based on my experience , and my research on competition , gender , and education , promoting all-girls ' education in the grade school years is a useful strategy to raise women who know how to lean in throughout life . 	0
WD	6371	Further in the study Mael highlights both the benefits for females and males to single-sex education he states that because coeducational schools foster obsession over hair and clothes and tend to make girls more silent that the single-sex education of girls is better for their mentality . 	0
WD	6372	Also , if girls schools don ' t have the interest / enough numbers to run advanced maths classes they may not offer it at all or only offer it as a correspondence subject . 	0
WD	6373	Why should I subsidize others who don ' t make the same degree of personal sacrifice ? 	0
WD	6374	My kids are better educated and better positioned in their life because of my personal sacrifice - pure and simple . 	0
WD	6375	Let me know what you think . 	0
WD	6376	Their is no voucher program in my community - i pay for the public schools with my taxes and the actual school with my own dollars . 	0
WD	6377	Propaganda - not compelling logic . 	0
WD	6378	I find them both rather frightening . 	0
WD	6379	The whole premise of this is flawed . 	0
WD	6380	People have taken their children out of public schools BECAUSE of the poor quality of education . 	0
WD	6381	The downturn in quality didn ' t start with people taking their kids out , it had been going on slowly but surely for years . 	0
WD	6382	Lack of discipline , turning teachers into babysitters , banning prayer and the Ten Commandments , and refusing to have anyone fail are just a few of the weapons that liberals and the Federal government have used to turn the public school system into a disaster . 	0
WD	6383	They have been screwing things up for decades now and to dymb to see the error ( s ) of their ways . 	0
WD	6384	The Public School System is a mess in many districts and it ' s not the responsibility of the parent to sacrifice their child ' s education in order to keep that failing system going . 	1
WD	6385	What a joke ! ! ! 	0
WD	6386	But if prayer really works , then that group of students calling out to God around the flagpole becomes a threat to those who deny the God ’ s existence or His sovereignty over this world . 	0
WD	6387	De La Salle would have mixed results because although single-sex education does have its benefits to boys , there is no clear evidence that exists either way . 	0
WD	6388	Sometimes single sex schools don ' t have the numbers ( or enough interest ) to run certain subjects for example – girls schools may not run shop classes , boys schools may not run home-ec classes . 	0
WD	6389	The point of view that those of us who pay for a private education are some how contributing to the failing public system is just crazy 	0
WD	6390	It ' s an opinion . 	0
WD	6391	It ' s not wrong to hold the opinoin that in general it ' s better for kids to go to school than to be homeschooled . 	1
WD	6392	And I never said that I think all homeschoolers are like the Duggars or all socially awkward , just that the overall " School " experience to me is very important for development of all children , and to me , that can ' t be entirely replicated at home . 	0
WD	6393	I have reasons behind it . 	0
WD	6394	Yes I do . 	0
WD	6395	Do I still think a decent majority of homeschoolers do it for reasons like sheltering kids , religion , wanting to keep control on kids , special snowflake syndrome , etc ? 	0
WD	6396	Do I judge all families that choose to homeschool based on that ? 	0
WD	6397	I ' m sorry but I do . 	0
WD	6398	Especially not here where there are a lot of highly intelligent people who break the mold IMO for " Every day " mothers in lots of ways . 	0
WD	6399	No way . 	0
WD	6400	Regina high school would benefit the most because their girls would have higher self-esteem and higher self-confidence in their learning abilities then they would at a coeducational school . 	0
WD	6401	I would look at the subjects on offer . 	0
WD	6402	But , from 2007-2010 , JHS was unable to “ initiate this program as designed ” and now plans to revamp the program . 	0
WD	6403	There is no need to politicize the classroom any more than it already has been . 	0
WD	6404	So , I guess by the author ' s reasoning , we ' re ALL " good " people . 	0
WD	6405	Good parents do what is best for their children , and they already support public schools with their tax dollars whether or not their children attend . 	0
WD	6406	It went great as far as academics and learning . 	0
WD	6407	I was sent to private schools my first 7 of years of schooling . 	0
WD	6408	It wasn ' t that I was stupid or that my parents wouldn ' t help , it was that I was bored to tears and had teachers who , even obvious to a 7th grader , HATED their jobs . 	0
WD	6409	Then , I was switched to public schooling in a " better " district , and my grades went from A ' s to D ' s . 	0
WD	6410	I know it sounds wrong , but that ' s the way it is . . . 	0
WD	6411	5 ) Religion is a touchy issue . 	0
WD	6412	A 2010 study on two separate pre-school classes displays negative , social affects on students , " In one class , the teacher used gender-specific language to address the children . 	0
WD	6413	The other teacher did not . 	0
WD	6414	It is clear to me that the issue of single-sex education juggles an academic as well as a psychological / social side . 	0
WD	6415	A article published by ABC News focuses on the negative effects of single-sex education when it comes to the social aspect . 	0
WD	6416	But does that single-sex environment only further the intelligence of the " elite " students in private education ? 	0
WD	6417	Again , Penn State ' s Lynn Liben denies any benefits of single-sex schooling , " Kids ' own occupational aspirations are going to be limited , and there could be long-term consequences where , for example , girls are used to being in roles only among other girls , then they have to face the real world where that ' s not the case . " 	0
WD	6418	Another factor in this issue is that most single-sex schools are private , and require an entrance test . 	0
WD	6419	Therefore , one can argue that the students in single-sex schools are already at an advantage . 	0
WD	6420	Studies show that women suffer from a stereotype threat in math and science , meaning that in the fields of math and science women are more apprehensive to perform due to their perceived inferiority to men . 	0
WD	6421	Perhaps that is why girls at my high school were so confident in their work , there were no boys to do better and perhaps this is why women are always found to do better in single-sex school environments . 	0
WD	6422	Even Jesus was against school prayer . 	0
WD	6423	Matt 6 : 5-6 Anyways , children can pray in school if they want to . 	0
WD	6424	Japan , where no one prays at school , has the lowest crime rate of any developed nation . 	0
WD	6425	I mean , c ’ mon ! 	0
WD	6426	How pathetic . 	0
WD	6427	Are we so weak minded ? 	0
WD	6428	Wow , here we go again . 	0
WD	6429	Christians blaming moral decline on prayer being taken out of school . 	0
WD	6430	At the end of the day , we are not preparing our students for the real world . 	0
WD	6431	That right hasn ’ t been taken away , they merely need to keep it to themselves . 	0
WD	6432	It just isn ’ t fair to have prayer required in schools . 	1
WD	6433	Many schools are choosing to spend those limited resources on single-sex programs despite the fact that “ there is no well-designed research showing that single-sex education improves students ’ academic performance , but there is evidence that sex segregation increases gender stereotyping and legitimizes institutional sexism . ” 	0
WD	6434	The Socialist agenda of world domination makes no place for solemn “ swearing ” between individuals . 	0
WD	6435	As a result of prioritizing single-sex classes , these schools don ’ t have the funds to spend on techniques that have actually been proven to improve academic outcomes , like smaller class sizes and personalized learning environments with mentors , counseling , and other supports . 	0
WD	6436	Private schools usually offer smaller classrooms , and generally provide better facilities for students . 	0
WD	6437	What ’ s next ? 	0
WD	6438	Today , parents and students can choose a variety of ways to homeschool . 	0
WD	6439	There are co-ops that offer classes to all levels from pre-k to high school . 	0
WD	6440	Some offer these classes throughout the week and you can choose which classes to take . 	0
WD	6441	Others offer classes once a week and parents teach . 	0
WD	6442	In fact , I didn ' t really grasp geometry till I started gardening . 	0
WD	6443	Today ' s homeschoolers can learn Russian or even geometry without their parent ' s assistance through DVDs and online courses . 	0
WD	6444	Homeschool has morphed into a uniquely American creation . 	0
WD	6445	We should all be proud of what it has become no matter where we stand on the homeschool versus public school debate . 	0
WD	6446	Then there is the mix of private school and homeschool , where the student is taught in a classroom three days a week and the parent downloads assignments from the same teacher the other two days a week . 	0
WD	6447	You can participate in any sport or any extracurricular function via these co-ops that you can in public school . 	0
WD	6448	I think mainstream is not that much good for our kids . 	1
WD	6449	There must be some changes for getting out their best from them . 	0
WD	6450	I ' m a regular education teacher . 	0
WD	6451	I have students mainstreamed into my class every year . 	0
WD	6452	My opinion is that it needs to be done far more judiciously than it is done now- if six exceptional children are put in my class , that is the equivalent of putting an entire special ed classroom into my regular class . 	0
WD	6453	I personally feel like these kids are shortchanged- some of them are good kids who need an adult close by and able to give more focused attention . 	0
WD	6454	In a class of 30+ , this isn ' t going to happen consistently . 	0
WD	6455	And some of the ones who come to me have legally imposed modifications , some of which have little or no bearing on what I teach , so I am not allowed to handle my class in a way I think it should be done . 	0
WD	6456	That impairs my efficiency as an educator . 	0
WD	6457	Also , some have so many modifications that for all intents and purposes they are merely taking a special ed class whose physical location just happens to be in a regular classroom . 	0
WD	6458	From my point of view , mainstreaming is not a terrible idea , but it is lamentable in its execution , and because of that , damaging in its results . 	1
WD	6459	Dr . Densmore encourages parents to keep themselves on an even keel and project a steady , positive attitude . 	0
WD	6460	Lib mentality on crack ! 	0
WD	6461	Extreme behavioral trouble , kids that just aren ' t able to keep up with what they ' re learning in average classes , etc . But on the whole , I like mainstreaming . 	1
WD	6462	Besides forbidding perjury , ( calling God to witness a lie ) and false swearing , this passage also forbids all rash and unnecessary swearing , and especially warns against promissory oaths – that require a performance . 	0
WD	6463	Public schools receive money from federal and state governments and are obligated to do whatever the state and national governments say . 	0
WD	6464	I have 2 kids born 3 years 2 days apart . 	0
WD	6465	It is a juggling act for teachers in inclusive classrooms to handle the needs of so many different students but it is well worth the reward . 	1
WD	6466	He also notes in the article the classroom ' s reaction to Jonas ' demeanor ( slow to articulate his words , delay in making his meaning understanding ) and how there is a clearly defined moment where the classroom establishes that Jonas is " different " . 	0
WD	6467	The professor realizes in that instance that this is a moment for himself and the classroom to accept and engage Jonas and somehow help him navigate his way throughout the course and the classroom . 	0
WD	6468	Forced prayer isn ’ t prayer anyway . 	0
WD	6469	When prayer was removed from the schools I think that it worked to the Christians advantage , not against them . 	0
WD	6470	I have a feeling that all we Christians are asking for when they want prayer back into the schools is for some sort of superior respect above all other religions in allowing us to have our sacred prayers brought into the schools . 	0
WD	6471	How many of us would stand for that kind of equality ? 	0
WD	6472	Jesus said to expect persecution , suffering , being servants of all and to be in the face of regular culture standards . 	0
WD	6473	Why would Christians demand or even expect that their way of doing things should be allowed and even made a routine ? 	0
WD	6474	It makes no sense to expect a public school to act in a Christian manner . 	0
WD	6475	He did not say to get upset when the government goes the opposite way of what is comfortable to us and try to make our systems fit our religious needs the best . 	0
WD	6476	If prayer being in the schools or not seriously affects the outcome of our students , or affects anything at all in the Christian world negatively than I think we have a lot more serious problems to think about than whether or not the kids are allowed to pray or not in school . 	0
WD	6477	It makes no sense to expect a public school to bring prayer back , if that ’ s what we want , we should send our kids to a Christian school . 	0
WD	6478	We not only have a strong parental relationship but the siblings do as well . 	0
WD	6479	This alone is a wonderful opportunity for building social skills . 	0
WD	6480	The usual argument for private schools is that they have the freedom to offer any curriculum that they choose , and the freedom to hire or fire teachers who can teach effectively . 	0
WD	6481	He notes that student bodies are increasingly riddled with drugs , violence , promiscuity , emotional disorders , crime , illiteracy , peer dependency and contempt for authority . 	0
WD	6482	It is disturbing to read the 101 reasons to homeschool . 	0
WD	6483	How is that for socialization ? 	0
WD	6484	One reason we choose to homeschool is because our family wanted to maintain family relationships in a way that cannot be done if our children are in school six-plus hours a day . 	0
WD	6485	Life is short and we want to spend the majority of our time together . 	0
WD	6486	Children grow up quickly and before you know it , they are heading off on their own . 	0
WD	6487	Of course this is not the only reason to homeschool but since we are interacting with each other all day long , it forces us to deal with relationship issues when they come up . 	0
WD	6488	We enjoy being around our children and they enjoy being around us . 	0
WD	6489	There is no longer an absolute and just legal basis for judging “ between a man and his brother , ” much less a man and his neighbor ( Deuteronomy 1 : 16 , 17 ) . 	0
WD	6490	Fortunately , my parents saw what was happening and moved me to a private school where I was challenged at or above the grade level I was in at the time . 	0
WD	6491	( I am certainly not the first to ask this question . ) 	0
WD	6492	Leonard Sax , a psychologist and physician , argues not only that gender segregated schools can be equal , but that they can be better than coeducational schooling . 	1
WD	6493	The Supreme Court ruled that separate but equal in regard to race is not actually equal at all . 	0
WD	6494	Should we expect gendered segregation of schooling to be any different ? 	0
WD	6495	According to the ACLU , not only are sex-segregated educational programs ineffective , they are illegal . 	1
WD	6496	Title IX , which states that “ No person in the United States shall , on the basis of sex , be excluded from participation in , be denied the benefits of , or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance … ” , is where the ACLU and other opponents of sex-segregated schools point to bolster their claim of illegality . 	0
WD	6497	He argues that the language of “ separate but equal ” in relation to the single-sex education debate is out of place because while racial segregation of schooling was about limiting students ’ access , single-sex education is about broadening students ’ access and opportunities . 	0
WD	6498	The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) disagrees . 	0
WD	6499	The ACLU has struggled against sex-segregated schooling for a very long time , but earlier this year they officially launched their “ Teach Kids , Not Stereotypes ” campaign . 	0
WD	6500	As a part of the campaign , they gathered data on single-sex education programs in 15 states and found that the majority of them were out of compliance with Title IX requirements . 	0
WD	6501	If I were to suddenly send my kids to public - I ' d be saving money ( not the school ) - but I ' d be not doing the best I can for my kids . 	0
WD	6502	My daughter will be 5 in Sept . and she is going to Kindergarten . 	0
WD	6503	She is very excited to go and I don ’ t want her to be behind . 	0
WD	6504	She can write her on name and knows some of her Abc ’ s but not all of them . 	0
WD	6505	She is small for age , but so was I . I was probably one if the smallest kids in my class my entire life but my mom did not hold me back and I am glad . 	0
WD	6506	I had some issues when I was younger with a learning disability , but I learned to cope . 	0
WD	6507	I had a lot of friends and even skipped a year of high school . 	0
WD	6508	All affairs of life become subject to state , rather than individual control . 	0
WD	6509	That is the only thing that kept me from being a delinquent . 	0
WD	6510	I would argue that integration is an aspiration and not a prerequisite for ensuring the best education for disabled children . 	0
WD	6511	This has the effect of treating all students the same and teaching them the same things , despite the fact that every student is unique , and not all students fit into the same categories . 	0
WD	6512	Just look at the students of the Kings School you see traveling to school I went to the Lorien novalis school fete at dural on Saturday amazed at the Muslim mothers there but then I thought this school gives them the chance to partipate in their children ' s education far more than the local state school so as a community private education is far better around than state education can be 	1
WD	6513	Worse yet even the most successful ones while good at rote items were quite helpless and pathetic when it came to independent or critical thinking . 	0
WD	6514	A number of conservative Christian leaders frequently complain about the tragic injustice of how kids aren ’ t allowed to pray in school anymore . 	0
WD	6515	You can customize the syllabus for your child according to his needs and abilities . 	0
WD	6516	There is a lot of heated rhetoric in the air these days regarding an alleged ban on prayer in the public schools . 	0
WD	6517	Admittedly 71 per cent of respondents at the 2001 census described themselves as " Christian " , but if most of those are not religious and don ' t believe in God , that ' s a pretty nominal affiliation . 	0
WD	6518	My reading of it is now lots of grandparents are awarding scholarships to their grandchildren and a good private school allows the grandparents access to the children ' s education by the out of hours activities that these schools offer against the public system . . 	0
WD	6519	Another poll in 2006 found that only 33 per cent of Britons describe themselves as " religious " . 	0
WD	6520	Rev . Ingram documents and points out that “ a broad , organized attack reaching into high places is under way to remove the third commandment from legal standing in the United States and throughout the world . ” 	0
WD	6521	In recent blogs , I ’ ve been concerned with clearing up some common misconceptions relating to areas of interface ( sometimes involving significant controversy and conflict ) between religion and secular American culture . 	0
WD	6522	It ' s in danger of becoming one of those joke laws , like the one that apparently says you can shoot a Welshman with a crossbow within the walls of Chester , and needs to be removed . 	0
WD	6523	If a private school is not teaching its students well enough , its graduation rate , or its college acceptance rate , will sink , and parents will be able to quickly remove their child and put him or her into a better school . 	0
WD	6524	E and did some kind of activity . 	0
WD	6525	Now days they do not do as much activity at school or at home . 	0
WD	6526	When I was in grade school we had Recess in the morning , then lunch at noon and after we ate we were taken out side and walked around the baseball field . 	0
WD	6527	Then we had P . 	0
WD	6528	Now the government is talking about kids being obese so we have to have health food . 	0
WD	6529	Its not so much what they eat as much as what they do ! 	0
WD	6530	Well the Federal Government got involved and that is what has ruined schools . 	0
WD	6531	Also school has dumbed down since I went . 	0
WD	6532	I would say to myself in frustration . 	0
WD	6533	“ This isn ’ t how the world is ! ” 	0
WD	6534	I had to get out , for the sake of my future ! 	0
WD	6535	For four long years , grades six through nine , I attended a rigid , traditional all-girls school . 	0
WD	6536	In 2013 , is single-sex education really the way to go ? 	1
WD	6537	Much more my style . 	0
WD	6538	Now days kids want to sit and play xbox , Nintendo , computers , ipads , or ipods or ride four wheelers when they should be out playing or riding bicycles . 	0
WD	6539	I part yea parents need to take an active role in their child ' s health and education , but if the school fails to sucks then let them put them in private school . 	0
WD	6540	The disruptive child gets more attention and takes away from the time spent on the rest of the class . 	0
WD	6541	Is we choose to send our children to a different , more expensive school in order to provide them with a better education , So be it . 	0
WD	6542	@eileenphoto . 	0
WD	6543	School can be very bad for you . 	1
WD	6544	For some people it can be a catastophic experience from which they never recover . 	0
WD	6545	To claim otherwise is rank ignorance . 	0
WD	6546	Being an involved parent with kids in public schools , it doesn ' t matter what policies I try to bring about , or suggestions I bring , or SAFETY CONCERNS that I have made the schools and transportation departments aware of , things will NOT change . 	0
WD	6547	I just wanted to present a much more common iteration . 	0
WD	6548	The racialized question of separate but equal in education was answered by Brown v . 	0
WD	6549	It is heartbreaking . 	0
WD	6550	Do you think I should of just left my kid in this class ? 	0
WD	6551	tara_mommy : I agree with you too , which is why I said : There are obviously cases where this isn ' t going to work . 	0
WD	6552	Give me a break ! 	0
WD	6553	It would require that they make certain that their children are given opportunities to interact with and form lasting relationships with other children in their age group , and this is can achieved by exposing them to extracurricular activities . 	0
WD	6554	I sent my kid to private school so that she could get a better education . 	0
WD	6555	Our “ Yes ” should be “ Yes , ” and our “ No ” should mean “ No . ” 	0
WD	6556	She was at a public school that was 90% hispanic . 	0
WD	6557	The problem was not their race but the fact that they were way behind in reading langauge and math . 	0
WD	6558	This situation was holding my kid and preventing her from excelling in her studies . 	0
WD	6559	Best decision they ever made . 	1
WD	6560	My parents scrimped and saved to send me to a private Catholic school from K - 8 . 	1
WD	6561	My study habits were much better and I was more prepared for college than most in my high school . 	0
WD	6562	I was ahead of my peers by high school . 	0
WD	6563	Kids are taught to pass standardized exams rather than learn the material effectively . 	0
WD	6564	My kids attend public school now and I detest it . 	0
WD	6565	In fact I had one teacher tell me she didn ' t assign homework because the kids didn ' t do it anyway . . . WHAT ? 	0
WD	6566	They can ' t bring home their books , so they rarely have homework to reinforce what they ' ve learned in school . 	0
WD	6567	I also don ' t agree for constant reward parties for doing everyday things . 	0
WD	6568	So reward the bad behavior ? ? 	0
WD	6569	If understood , our word uttered in integrity should of itself be a sufficient and proper bond . 	0
WD	6570	It is , and always has been pure ignorance , stop slating something you have no experience or knowledge about . 	0
WD	6571	If it is a public school it should be a place where all cultures and all religions and all people should be able to come and feel comfortable in order to do what they are there to do which I ’ m sorry is not to learn about religion . 	0
WD	6572	If you want prayer forced send your child to a religious specific school . 	0
WD	6573	Yet you walk down the street or listen to the 18-24ish yr olds today and they are complaining about having to work more than 6 hours at a decently paying job . 	0
WD	6574	I remember my Grandfather telling stories of the horrible things that he was forced to do in WWII things that no one should ever have to go through , NO ONE ( at 19 mind you ) . 	0
WD	6575	In conclusion , I personally believe that forcing prayer upon our children in the class room is wrong . 	1
WD	6576	Ok if anyone has actually read this entire thing I thank you for your time and I apologize if I have jumped around a lot . 	0
WD	6577	I know that more than half of you remember when you were young if you didn ’ t do what your father told you , you were going to get the belt , and you know what you sure never made that mistake again . 	0
WD	6578	In today ’ s society it has become acceptable to avoid all sense of responsibility . 	0
WD	6579	People today are basically in my mind , for a lack of a better word soft . 	0
WD	6580	Now , you even show your child a belt with the intention of hitting him / her and your own child can sue you . 	0
WD	6581	This was different . 	0
WD	6582	This was saying we believe in coeducation , because we live in a coed world , but in this one particular area we ’ re giving up . 	0
WD	6583	Those schools weren ’ t founded on the premise that men and women have incompatible intellects , but in recognition of what were often limited educational opportunities for women . 	0
WD	6584	Their origin stories belonged to the past , and their traditions continued , Hogwarts-like , under their own steam . 	0
WD	6585	Everything I could think of saying sounded offensive or deflating or dumb : math is hard for girls ; they—that is , you—need special treatment ; boys ’ and girls ’ brains are different ; pre-algebra with boys in the room is just too exciting—you won ’ t know what hit you ! 	0
WD	6586	If we ’ d chosen an all-girls ’ school , that would be one thing . 	0
WD	6587	I ’ d never found the arguments especially persuasive . 	0
WD	6588	But what really brought me up short was imagining how I would explain the policy to my daughter , whose best friends were boys . 	0
WD	6589	A few years ago , when I was looking at middle schools for my daughter , I heard about a school that sounded lovely except for one thing : it had a policy of separating math classes by gender . 	0
WD	6590	Having reported on a vogue for single-sex classrooms in the nineties , I knew the rationale : girls and boys distract one another ; girls need extra ego boosts and a gentle approach when it comes to studying math and science . 	0
WD	6591	The public schools are not going to get better . 	1
WD	6592	no . teachers keep asking for more with no difference in teaching just more money and if they dont get it what happens they strike . well thats real nice on kids education is it not boo hoo you TAKE YOUR KIDS PRIVATE IF YOU CARE AS I DID 	1
WD	6593	BIG E . what about all the money we do send to our schools . does it help our child . 	0
WD	6594	Now , we are talking about a school-sponsored prayer . 	0
WD	6595	No student-sponsored prayer is , or needs to be , prohibited . 	0
WD	6596	But in the Cold War , America was distinguishing itself from a Communist enemy that was known to be atheistic . 	0
WD	6597	So , the school district in New York decided to develop a prayer which they thought anyone who believed in God could pray . 	0
WD	6598	But you have to look at the background on this . 	0
WD	6599	Our country was initially populated by people escaping religious persecution who were looking for a safe have to practice their own religion . 	0
WD	6600	When we came together as a country , we had a religiously diverse population , so when we wrote the constitution , we had to say that the government would not support any religion at the expense of others , nor would it prohibit the free exercise of religion . 	0
WD	6601	Prayer in public schools was a complicated issue where there was a religious diversity amongst students and teachers , because , how could , say , Catholics and Protestants agree on a prayer to say . 	0
WD	6602	( Those of you who pray , do you ever pray generic prayers ? ) 	0
WD	6603	I am sorry but we are forced through our property taxes to support a system that we do not believe works and shows no sign of improving . 	1
WD	6604	We also incur the additional cost associate with sending our child to a school we feel confident will give her what she need to be successful in life . 	0
WD	6605	So I say Allison Benedikt , treat the cause not the system . 	0
WD	6606	The major thing was that I always felt like the presence of boys would have made the girls far less bitchy ( as they did in my co-ed school experiences ) . 	0
WD	6607	My wife and I live in a very expensive suburb . 	0
WD	6608	We pay very high taxes , most of which are allocated to an adequate school system that is monetarily driven by a broken system designed to teach children the answers to the questions not how they derive at them . 	0
WD	6609	As such there is pressure on the schools to meet the GPA standards that there states put on the schools that they have forgotten why the children are there in the first place . 	0
WD	6610	Every other week we hear stories about another child that has died from an overdose of heroin and how it has become an epidemic in the school systems . 	0
WD	6611	The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( IDEA ) of 1990 requires all schools to provide services for children who need special education in the “ least restrictive environment conducive to learning . ” 	0
WD	6612	And in that aspect , he ' s correct : According to Virginia law , parents who have a religious objection can opt to not only home-school their children but to do so without any government oversight , meaning there is no mandatory curriculum and no checks placed on the family to ensure the children are learning at an appropriate level . 	0
WD	6613	It was previously mentioned in this project that coeducational schools need to adopt a non-stereotyping language and equal opportunity environment to foster equity and success between boys and girls . 	0
WD	6614	There is about 5 cases a year for the whole province of Quebec , mostly very immature children . 	0
WD	6615	Ours is Sept . 30th , and no one ” red shirts ” . 	0
WD	6616	What IS the cut-off date ? 	0
WD	6617	He sounds ready . 	0
WD	6618	Everybody in my family ( my siblings , husband ’ s sibling ) skipped a year in school i . e . moved forward faster . 	0
WD	6619	Three of my girls were born in August , but there is no question of holding them back . 	1
WD	6620	I am a product and proponent of the public school system , and do my best to support to support local public schools ( especially when it comes to music and arts programs ) whenever possible . 	0
WD	6621	I also send my son to a local private elementary school . 	0
WD	6622	More to the point , US public schools are the best in the world . 	1
WD	6623	So , no special education , no behavior problems , and no unbalanced portion of low socio-economic students coming from families with suspect value of education . 	0
WD	6624	If students fail the high-stakes test in America , schools are forced to pass them on to the next grade , again , because public schools are rarely allowed to enforce retention policies to prevent students from being placed in classes beyond their demonstrable ability . 	0
WD	6625	They are required to teach EVERYONE regardless of ability , income , behavior , etc . . . Other countries have education systems built upon the tract theory where if a student fails a test at a certain grade level , that student moves into an alternative education tract that will prepare them for " career " training at their " ability level . " 	0
WD	6626	The ugly truth about private schools is that these institutions can select who attends through entrance exams and other admissions criteria . 	0
WD	6627	It is absolutely correct . 	0
WD	6628	Public schools have neither option . 	0
WD	6629	They can also enforce consequences for attendance and discipline policies . 	0
WD	6630	We were taught tolerance and acceptance . 	0
WD	6631	Clearly we ’ re off to a great start . 	0
WD	6632	With private schools stealing students away from public schools , the problem is exacerbated further . 	0
WD	6633	This ultimately results in other countries getting to the point where only best are tested and compared internationally , whereas American public schools test EVERY student at EVERY level . 	0
WD	6634	Pulled him out again and put him in a selective school and he ' s loving it . 	0
WD	6635	This could lead to costly court battles , or more children entering into inadequate homeschooling programs . 	0
WD	6636	What if the child ' s parents dissent ? 	0
WD	6637	Although I accept that initial intentions can be noble , sometimes , the language of liberation can carry an unintended payload . 	0
WD	6638	If you don ' t do well , it isn ' t necessarily the school ' s fault . 	0
WD	6639	Public school is what you and your parents make of it . 	1
WD	6640	Everyone I know went to public school and on to college . 	0
WD	6641	It really is up to the student to do the work . 	0
WD	6642	Maybe schools were better then . 	0
WD	6643	We didn ' t feel unprepared . 	0
WD	6644	I hope these kids get a chance in life their parents are denying them . 	0
WD	6645	And people who are fortunate enough to send their children to a private school or to , even better , homeschool , are not going to make a difference . 	0
WD	6646	Social advancement ? 	0
WD	6647	Human nature makes the final result , of anything having a lack of competition and guaranteed employment , stagnation for the simple lack of incentive . 	0
WD	6648	Unions and their inherent lack of competition is what is wrong with our schools , government and anything else unions monopolize . 	0
WD	6649	It ' s human nature . 	0
WD	6650	The problem is without competition , the product becomes stale and innovation disappears . 	0
WD	6651	Unions DO NOT like competition ( try walking across a strike line , you SCAB ) . 	0
WD	6652	For years they nearly had one , the result , the sad shape of our public school system . 	0
WD	6653	Public schools want a monopoly . 	0
WD	6654	Those enrolled in private schools still support public schools thru RET ' s like every other property owner . 	0
WD	6655	Whether the result is choosing a state school , independent school or home education will depend on our children , our selves and our family situations . 	0
WD	6656	If we don ' t make decisions based on our ideas and beliefs , our moral values and our understanding of the world - then surely we are failing to do our best for our children . 	0
WD	6657	To say school is best is every bit as ideological as any argument for home education . 	0

WD	6660	Others come to it later because school has not worked for their child . 	0
WD	6661	Some choose it at the start because their child appears to be unsuited to early formal education , or because they favour education methods not available in state schools . 	0

WD	6665	For example , consider the theories that " boys are visual learners " and " girls are auditory learners . " 	0
WD	6666	Their research suggests that learning is best accomplished when the delivery method matches the subject matter . 	0
WD	6667	According to researchers Dr . Rebecca Bigler and Dr . Lise Eliot , " Placing children into classrooms based on their gender and making assumptions about their physiology , brains , interests , and learning ability will virtually guarantee that teachers ' expectations are biased and their gender-based practices are misguided for most of their students . " 	0
WD	6668	Bigler and Eliot maintain that many of the popular ideas about gender learning are simply untrue . 	0
WD	6669	Still , critics of single-sex education contend that the vast majority of research is based on pseudoscience " laughable to neuroscientists . " 	0
WD	6670	The differences that have been identified are considered too small to warrant separating students . 	0

WD	6713	Co-ed schools are also the cause for some boys dropping out of school when in fact the society benefits by keeping these boys engaged in education and make them complete school . some posters here have admitted girls could better benefit by attending single sex-schools than co-ed schools . 	0

WD	6721	What a stupid argument ! 	0
WD	6722	We are all so glib in the way we promise and don ’ t perform and never realize that it is sapping our moral energy . “ Think then , what happens to a nation rife with perjury , broken marriage covenants , unforgiveness , cults with demonic covenants , extortion , bribery , libel , slander , profanity , hypocrisy , idle talk , and lawsuits initiated solely for revenge and personal gain . 	0
WD	6723	And there ’ s the real trouble with this single-sex approach . 	0

WD	6725	Not all people who forego public schools are wealthy , some of had to sacrifice to do it , but it was definitely worth every penny . 	0
WD	6726	I felt I was letting both sides down when teaching in an inclusive secondary in London . 	0
WD	6727	The presumptions behind it are fusty and often plain silly—which might make them easy for kids who don ’ t conform to them to dismiss , except that their teachers and principals are repeating them so earnestly . 	0
WD	6728	I ' m sure that if we did away with private schools the government would then fix all the problems wiht public education . 	0

WD	6737	Well last night I caught 60 Minutes ' rebroadcast of Redshirting - Holding kids back from kindergarten , which I had missed back in March , and I was , once again , all in a huff . 	0
WD	6738	This piece of journalism , as have many others ( in both print & broadcast ) focused solely on the superficial and relatively transient perceived benefits of holding your 5-year-old back , while Mr . Safer & team failed to explore any of the real developmental reasons some children really do need to put off kindergarten for a year and how that extra time may benefit them in the short and long term . 	0

WD	6746	Redshirting your 5-year-old solely for the purpose of giving them an advantage in sports , a leg up in the future popularity contest , or just to save them from the horrible fate of being the " youngest " in their class ( and the last to have a driver ' s license ) drives me NUTZ ! 	0

WD	6749	Or leave it to the teacher ( me ) to pick the kid up from a supermarket for shoplifting and sort it out , because they are watching the football . 	0
WD	6750	I tended to teach the kids in my class as individuals . 	0
WD	6751	I would also like to add that I personally , in many years in a very mixed comprehensive in Inner London , never took the blindest bit of notice of who was currently " failing " as a group , whether it be black , Asian , white boys , girls or bunny rabbits . 	0
WD	6752	At school , or homeschooled . 	0
WD	6753	The kids that do well and attain up to their optimum levels are the ones with good parental support . 	0
WD	6754	You really can ' t expect a child to listen to a teacher telling them they can succeed , when their parents can ' t be bothered to pick them up after a football match , or send them to school dirty , unwashed . 	0
WD	6755	Sadly , many parents seemed to regard school as a babysitter , not something to be worked with , and were all to ready to blame the teachers or school rather then themselves or the child . 	0
WD	6756	If a teacher can call the parent and get backed up , and work with the parent , then the kid will do well and work through difficulties . 	0
WD	6757	The one factor that I did notice made the biggest difference was , as mentioned above , parenting . 	0
WD	6758	My high school graduating class had fewer than 50 seniors , yet PTA meetings had to be held in the auditorium . 	0
WD	6759	One high school where I taught had almost 2 , 000 students ; what passed for PTA meetings were held in the principal ' s office . 	0
WD	6760	Parents had a stake in their public schools when they were neighborhood schools . 	0
WD	6761	Neighborhood schools were community gathering places , where parents , kids and teachers all came together and all knew each other . 	0
WD	6762	Run , don ' t walk , to the nearest private school . 	1
WD	6763	Public schools are not about education ; they are about social engineering . 	0
WD	6764	I taught in public high schools for 15 years . 	0
WD	6765	My advice to parents ? 	0
WD	6766	It is time we stop rewarding a bad system , and reform it with the good old reward system that promotes doing better called competition . 	0
WD	6767	The school board for my system was made up of lay people , each of whom had a personal agenda that had nothing to do with education . 	0
WD	6768	In 15 years I never saw a board member visit either of my two schools . 	0
WD	6769	I believe a more disciplined school in the formative teenage years pays off when the child matures . 	0
WD	6770	I know my friend ' s case is rather extreme , but the thing is . . . the vast majority of my homeschooled friends have similar issues . 	0
WD	6771	Many of them are also very over-protected by their parents , and many of them , to be honest , act more like 6th-graders than 10th-graders . 	0
WD	6772	Jewelry ? 	0
WD	6773	Purse ? 	0
WD	6774	We had a Regina George , Gretchen Wieners , Karen Smith and , of course , a Cady Heron . 	0
WD	6775	Really , it was like Mean Girls ! 	0
WD	6776	Who makes your sneakers ? 	0
WD	6777	Just because we had a strict uniform , by no means did that mean there wasn ’ t competition wardrobe-wise . 	0
WD	6778	I was sent on a wild goose chase from clique to clique . 	0
WD	6779	I actually had to go down there one day , find the culprit and set the record straight . 	0
WD	6780	There was to be no cross-contamination between groups ; you had to choose your friends or the queen bees would choose for you . 	0
WD	6781	When I eventually found her , she gave me a snobby and unapologetic , “ Sorry , are we done here ? ” , swiveled on her pink Converse and strutted in the opposite direction . 	0
WD	6782	Not everything in the media is okay . 	0
WD	6783	Being outdoors by yourself can be dangerous . 	0
WD	6784	She acts younger than her age , and I often find that in order to get along with her , I have to act less mature as well . 	0
WD	6785	Now , I understand her parents ' point of view . 	0
WD	6786	But if you ' re going to survive in it , you have to know what you ' re up against . 	0
WD	6787	I can tell you without a doubt that when my friend reaches adulthood and leaves home , she will be stepping into a world that she knows nothing about , and she ' s going to suffer because of it . 	0
WD	6788	Would she send me to a public school now - ABSOLUTELY NOT ! ! ! 	1
WD	6789	I was even a public school high school teacher ! 	0
WD	6790	I trust that was tongue in cheek ? 	0
WD	6791	And , until America starts realizing that education is a privilege that should be supported and respected , where teachers are revered , we are always going to have problems . 	0
WD	6792	But she ' s not a child anymore , she ' s going to legally be an adult in two years , and she does not understand the world at all . 	0
WD	6793	So yes , if you want a strong , no bull , parent supported , child first , customer service-based , " you will follow the rules or you will get kicked out " educational atmosphere where education and discipline and respect are demanded , then you should send your child to a private school . 	0
WD	6794	And as long as the schools live in fear of these parents and " live to serve the public " and don ' t want to anger parents and are worried about their government funding , they are always going to kowtow to pissy parents and weak teachers and administrators . 	0
WD	6795	Yeah , the world is a pretty suckish place , and I can completely understand why any parent would want to shield their child from it . 	0
WD	6796	I can not believe that someone in the room did not beotch slap her for suggesting such lunacy . 	0
WD	6797	There is no more public education , it is all indoctrination , warm and fuzzy political correctness . 	0
WD	6798	She is a total marxist moron . 	0
WD	6799	They have something to lose if they act a fool . 	0
WD	6800	YOU ARE IDIOTS . 	0
WD	6801	I apologize , but your child may be playing violent video games and what not , but when they go out and rape or shoot someone . 	0
WD	6802	Parents are the ones that are supposed to be teaching they ’ re kids values and morals and what is right and wrong . 	0
WD	6803	O ’ and side note all those parents that think that “ Angry Music & Video Games ” are the root of all evil and its what ’ s causing your children to become evil and lash out at society . 	0
WD	6804	SOCIETY SIDE NOTE : The reason that society is bad today is not because of the lack of Fear for God . 	0
WD	6805	It is because of what our society has become . 	0
WD	6806	It will not be because of the video game it will be your lack of parenting , maybe you should have hit them those last few times . 	0
WD	6807	And if any of you are saying “ Well what about the belt ? ” there is a difference between getting a belt to the butt and physically assaulting your child multiple times with your fists . 	0
WD	6808	All parents carefully consider their child ' s education and those decisions are not taken lightly . 	0
WD	6809	The parents think of school as a free baby sitter . 	0
WD	6810	People who send their children to a private school are not “ bad ” people . 	0
WD	6811	I ' m just going to say " so why not move her to 3rd grade where she belongs ? " 	0
WD	6812	They want the best for their kids ! 	0
WD	6813	I have worked for a group that goes into the school systems to talk to the kids . 	0
WD	6814	I think the individual schools themselves and and the individual needs of your daughters are more important than generalisations about education and single-sex or co-ed schools . 	0
WD	6815	However , if you want an opinon from a general education pespective , and you can read up on this , the general rule is that single sex schools are better for the academic performance of your daughters . 	1
WD	6816	Research is quite clear about this . 	0
WD	6817	The children in the private system , are polite , listen to what you are telling them and responsive . 	0
WD	6818	For the benefit of chidlren of course . 	0
WD	6819	I agree - Kids can do great in the public school system and parents DO need to be involved . 	1
WD	6820	It is wasting valuable school time . 	0
WD	6821	I have had parents tell me , I gave birth , my job is over , it is your ( mine , the teachers , ect ) to raise and educate these kids . 	0
WD	6822	It stems from children having kids , forcing them off on the grandparents , and the children thinking that they mother is there sister . 	0
WD	6823	One of the benefits of SEN education arguably benefits all children ; class sizes are smaller ensuring a better teacher to pupil ratio . 	0
WD	6824	How prevalent is redshirting anyway ? 	0
WD	6825	*How many homeschooling families do you know ? * I cited three as specific examples , so you ' re way off already . 	0
WD	6826	*None of them cite a desire to avoid diversity as a reason to homeschool . * There are numerous studies on why people homeschool , and a significant portion of the reasons boil down to " wanted to avoid having my children subjected to opinions , values , beliefs , etc . , that I don ' t agree with .

WD	6827	Do you have any advice on how to start to get people together and have the law changed and to allow school prayer back so it will be constitutional ? 	0
WD	6828	I will like to start prayer in the schools of Moses Lake , Wa . 	1
WD	6829	You can pray whenever you want . 	0
WD	6830	Do not be like them , for your Father knows what you need before you ask him . ” 	0
WD	6831	I always thought of girls as the sports stars and the valedictorians , because at my school they were . 	0
WD	6832	But when you pray , go into your room , close the door and pray to your Father , who is unseen . 	0
WD	6833	I tell you the truth , they have received their reward in full . 	0
WD	6834	And when you pray , do not keep on babbling like pagans , for they think they will be heard because of their many words . 	0
WD	6835	Then your Father , who sees what is done in secret , will reward you . 	0
WD	6836	This entire article is ridiculous . 	0
WD	6837	Who are you all to say that we need God in our lives . 	0
WD	6838	You can pray quietly whenever you want and does the bible not say in : Matthew 6 : 5-8 “ And when you pray , do not be like the hypocrites , for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men . 	0
WD	6839	You are still allowed to pray in school as long as it doesn ’ t affect the education that the school system is trying to give our children . 	0
WD	6840	All the enrichment camps and afterschool activities will not make up for the fact that your kid is bored for 6-8 hours per day in school and whips through their homework in a flash , or takes all night because they are so bored they can ' t stand it . 	0
WD	6841	I believe that parents should send their kids to the school the best fits the needs of the child at the time . 	0
WD	6842	Yes , parents can provide support and should , but when your child is bored at school , there is only so much you can do to help with that . 	0
WD	6843	Occasionally , you will get lucky and have a teacher that will challenge your kid in class , but if not , then what ? 	0
WD	6844	And it is the cornerstone of a child ’ s well-being , ” Densmore told me . 	0
WD	6845	The National Association for the Education of Young Children offers lots of information about the benefits of play and how parents and teachers can help facilitate it . 	0
WD	6846	Prayer should be back in school to give these kids that are going up a sense of belief , trust and fear of God , because kids these days think they could do anything they want to and get away with it . 	1
WD	6847	On the community level , Densmore encourages parents to take an active role . 	0
WD	6848	Parents should talk with teachers , principals , and other parents . 	0
WD	6849	Look for preschools with facilitated play as the center of their curriculum . 	0
WD	6850	I have only one more problem . 	0
WD	6851	Where would we find enough time for an actual school day ? 	0
WD	6852	This is where the difference is . 	0
WD	6853	Teaching things that contradicting any belief , or lack of belief , is one thing . 	0
WD	6854	Teaching " God " and then praying to that deity is something else , and just as problematic as teaching " no God " then insisting all recite " There is no God " at some point in the school day over and over . 	0
WD	6855	Now if those who would prefer the be public school prayer have no problem with children reciting that last one too , and also showing similar respect to any other deity ( ies ) any of them might possibly believe in , or their family does . 	0
WD	6856	If the shoe were switched would those so quick to treat enforced prayer as something that hurts no one if they were taught to pray to Allah , Zoroaster , Zeus and the Gods ? 	0
WD	6857	The inmates are running the asylum in many public schools . 	0
WD	6858	They cannot correct errors , cannot encourage high achievers for fear of upsetting the regular students , assign homework , or expect respect from the students . 	0
WD	6859	No matter how much we may or may not respect Darwin and what he brought forth , he was no God , as I ' m sure all would say . 	0
WD	6860	No matter when your child starts kindergarten , it ’ s a new beginning for him or her—and for you . 	0
WD	6861	Additionally , many homeschooling families belong to like-minded groups that meet regularly and participate in field trips . 	0
WD	6862	The more people leave , the worse its going to become . 	0
WD	6863	Pray on your own time . 	0
WD	6864	They do not belong . 	0
WD	6865	Offend everybody equally ! ! 	0
WD	6866	No prayers in schools ! 	1
WD	6867	And if the answer to that is " Maybe , but those children are still alive " , then consider this : an estimated 16 children per year commit suicide because of problems at school . 	0
WD	6868	Even the language of the serious case review demonstrates this failure of understanding . 	0
WD	6869	Small wonder that home-educating parents are afraid of conferring power on people who do not know what it is that they are judging . 	0
WD	6870	This is particularly so for families who have taken children out of school ; they would be in the insidious position of being answerable to a system that they believe has already failed them . 	0
WD	6871	The idea that you can protect children simply by increasing government involvement ignores the difficulties the education system itself imposes on the lives of many families . 	0
WD	6872	Every year we would by used uniforms and used books whenever possible . 	0
WD	6873	My Parents could barley afford to send my sister and I to private school . 	0
WD	6874	When we moved to an areas with better schools , we would go to public schools or magnet schools . 	0
WD	6875	We took sack lunches and cut cost where ever possible . 	0
WD	6876	Both my sister and I plan to send our children to private school as well . 	1
WD	6877	We scrapped by then and now my sister and I have been pretty successful in life . 	0
WD	6878	Because we got a better education than was available in most public schools . 	0
WD	6879	Why ? 	0
WD	6880	My parents would have always send us to Public schools if they were good schools . 	0
WD	6881	When we both got to college we were ahead of the game with AP credits and CLEP tests . 	0
WD	6882	He made this children take the Vineyard Adaptive Behavior Scales test , which identifies well-adapted behaviors and maturity . 	0
WD	6883	Why don ' t students that have a particularly strong religious faith go to schools that are especially for them ( e . g . Muslims go to Muslim schools , Christians to Christian schools , Jewish to Jewish schools etc . ) , and for all other students , no religious doctrine in the schools , period . 	1
WD	6884	Here ' s a suggestion : why don ' t we all stop pretending that Canada is this utopian place where everyone holds hands and sings about buying the world a coke in their own language . 	0
WD	6885	I find it simply offensive that Christianity is seen as some sort of imperialistic oppressive practice even when the majority of the students in the class are Christian , because it makes students of other faiths ' uncomfortable , yet any other religion cries racism when the situation is reversed . 	0
WD	6886	If my memory serves me correctly , there has been plenty of controversy over reciting the Lord ' s Prayer in schools , yet this special status has been given to Muslim students , in this case . 	0
WD	6887	If so then people better start brushing up on their knowledge of less widely practiced religions , such as Wicca , Shinto , Satanism , Kabbalah , Bahai ' i , etc . And what happens when one practice interferes with another practice ' s beliefs . 	0
WD	6888	Are we supposed to grant exceptions to everyone claiming to be part of a religious group ? 	0
WD	6889	When does it end ? 	0
WD	6890	We are getting to a place in this country where political correctness is trumping almost everything else . 	0

WD	6892	Hi Carol This is such sound advise and thank goodness there are Head Teachers like yourself out there ! ! 	0
WD	6893	My Son has complex needs and starts mainstream in September and it makes me angry when I hear Parents like Joanne having such a struggle to find a place for their Child I agree too , that although labels are scary for Parents , with them , the Children do get more benefits and support , so can be a positive thing Fran 	0
WD	6894	These beliefs on the effects of homeschooling on socialization have led to numerous studies on homeschooled kids . 	0
WD	6895	Rather than prove these beliefs to be correct , they show a very clear picture that homeschooled children and teens present a distinct advantage over their peers in public school . 	0
WD	6896	Because of the growing incidences of peer pressure and bullying , violence , drugs , promiscuity and moral relativism , the greater is the belief of parents that they need to take their kids out of public school before these influences have a detrimental effect on both their lives and their future . 	0
WD	6897	It is ironic to say the least that in Dr . Brian Ray ’ s California study , around 92 percent of public school superintendents harbors the erroneous notions that homeschooled kids are socially impaired , emotionally unstable , and “ too judgmental ” of their community and the world in general . 	0
WD	6898	President Theodore Roosevelt once said , “ To educate a man in mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to society . ” 	0
WD	6899	This is an ideal that is being espoused by homeschooling parents who no longer wish to expose their children to the questionable teachings and people that are a part of the public school system . 	0
WD	6900	Teachers , on the other hand , are afraid that they will lose their jobs to more effective parents who are not even certified educators . 	0
WD	6901	It is not surprising , therefore , that they would constantly put down homeschooling as not an effective form of education , specifically targeting the “ lack of social skills ” as a main point against homeschoolers . 	0
WD	6902	What she will get is brainwashed to be a liberal zombie and grow up to write and believe stupid articles like this one . 	0
WD	6903	What a load of BS . 	0
WD	6904	All I can say is WOW ! ! ! 	0
WD	6905	That ' s right , I do not give a s**t about the public schools system , I care about giving my child the best education and best opportunities possible and she will NOT get that at a public school . 	0
WD	6906	I never post on these things but today I had to . 	0
WD	6907	However it may take a little while to really settle down to an “ absence of a rigid routine ” before you can enjoy this freedom from timetables and rules of an educational institution . 	0

WD	6916	I ’ m thinking / planning on submitting this to the local Sarnia newspaper in repsonse to all the poorly written letters lobbying for prayer to be brought back into the schools . 	0
WD	6917	Additionally , it is said that homeschooled children do well on standardised tests , and as adults , are known to be self-directed learners and reliable employees . 	0
WD	6918	On the other hand , as a family member recently pointed out to me , by homeschooling children we could be stunting the development of their socialisation skills . 	0
WD	6919	I make that point because teachers specialise in specific subject areas and if parents choose to homeschool their children , it is expected that they would have vast knowledge of each subject area which they choose to teach their children . 	0
WD	6920	Research in the United States has shown that homeschooling is growing at a rate of seven to 15 per cent per year , with millions of children currently learning at home . 	0
WD	6921	Indeed , that is a distinct possibility and the onus would have to be on the parents to ensure that does not happen . 	0
WD	6922	And , some studies indicate that children who are redshirted also have higher use of special education services in elementary school and higher rates of behavioral problems in adolescence . 	0
WD	6923	I ' m always fasinated by the ideology argument . 	0
WD	6924	But to just bring in services for one group flies in the face of equality . 	0
WD	6925	I think that religion should be either implemented for ALL religions ; or otherwise , for none . 	1
WD	6926	Doesn ’ t it make sense that they would therefore do a better job and that public schools would therefore do better in quantitative comparisons ? 	0
WD	6927	The public school system lets them deal with real life too , unfortunate that it may be but that is what ' s out there in college and the work force too . 	0
WD	6928	This is only a " compelling " argument to the MSNBC boobs who wrote this . 	0

WD	6936	If I had teen-aged children today I would seek out single-sex education for them without hesitation . 	1
WD	6937	Then those who ran public education decreed that every child should have a college-prep curriculum . 	0
WD	6938	When I left that school , seniors were lucky to have two hours of shop ; the rest of the time they spent taking courses for which they had no need , desire or use . 	0

WD	6941	Co-ed schools don ' t cultivate the cooperation or better understanding between the opposite sexes , That ' s a myth . . . otherwise why would you have high rates of divorce and acrimony just a few years after they graduate out of co-ed schools and colleges ? 	0
WD	6942	Schooling is not a time for all such acts and learning falls by the wayside . 	0
WD	6943	No wonder why our educational standards are sliding . . 	0

WD	6946	You are a bad person if you don ' t do whatever it takes to get YOUR child the best education and start in life possible , and if that means sending your child to private school , that ' s what you do . 	1
WD	6947	So , does delaying kindergarten give kids a head start ? 	0
WD	6948	Private and parochial schools are more likely to adhere to the same value system as the families whose kids attend them , while public schools tend to reflect the values of whatever politician is in charge of them at the moment . 	0
WD	6949	I found the attitude and behaviour of students in the co ed school to be better , and i attribute that to the influence of the opposite sex . 	0
WD	6950	IMO the only ' bad person ' here is the person writing the article . 	0
WD	6951	The writer is free to send her kids wherever she wants and so is everyone else . 	0
WD	6952	Even despite this range , the overall frequency is much lower than previously thought . 	0
WD	6953	However , evidence also indicates that age at school entry is a poor predictor of school success , with younger children performing just as well or better than their older peers . 	0
WD	6954	It appears that it can , at least for the first few years of elementary school , and this is especially true for kids who are already at risk for school difficulties due to socio-economic factors ( unfortunately those are also the kids who are least likely to start later ) . 	0

WD	6964	On the school board etc . If they want the middle class to leave their kids at public school they need to put effort in to meet their educational needs of the children and give us a reason to stay not just fob us off with your children will be all right because of their demographic background . 	0
WD	6965	The standard was set at the lowest common denominator with no effort put into challenge children who were bored . 	0
WD	6966	They need to bring back classes where all children ' s needs are met not just the worst behaved , why should the whole class be punished because one child ' s behaviour . 	0
WD	6967	Composite classes should be discouraged as teachers are unable to meet all the levels needed and are more likely to ignore those who can do the work at the higher grade . 	0
WD	6968	They do not have time to offer more complex work or seem reluctant to celebrate intelligence , attention to detail and completing work that comes from the higher achieving students . 	0
WD	6969	In all of the three years before baled from public school despite talks and promises that things would improve nothing changed . 	0
WD	6970	We left and went from bored , hating school children to excited about learning , keen to get to school , enthused again . 	0
WD	6971	Not exactly over night but certainly by the end of the 2nd term at the new school . 	0
WD	6972	Public schools need to do more to keep those of us who care about education attending their schools . 	0

WD	6978	If you look at education philosophy and ideas it becomes clear that our current state school system is very much based on a narrow set of ideas . 	0
WD	6979	To not have an ideology - does this mean that you don ' t think that any other world view is acceptable , or that you simple don ' t think ? 	0
WD	6980	That it is wrong to do something because you belief it is right and have thought about the ideas behind it ! 	0
WD	6981	If they survive all this lot they can be brainwashed into embracing multiculturalism , diversity , man-made climate change and sex education , even when their parents don ' t want it for them . 	0

WD	6989	I asked them to tell me why . 	0
WD	6990	I later learned that I came off as a combination of snobby , shy and rude – simply because I hadn ’ t spent enough time in social situations or just being around the opposite sex , and I had no idea how to talk to them ! 	0
WD	6991	Switching schools changed that all for the better . 	0

WD	7006	Also , if your children attended this school , parent involvement was an expectation . 	0
WD	7007	As a result , every Home / School association meeting was packed . 	0

WD	7009	I knew the parents of every child my kids went to school with . 	0

WD	7012	I personlly am acquainted with four families who are home schooling their large families . 	0

WD	7022	It ' s 12 : 40 . . . 	0
WD	7023	That the Commonwealth of Virginia has such a rich tradition of the education of young people and allows this travesty is shameful . 	0
WD	7024	The point is not to fling those stereotypes back and forth , but to have a respectful discussion about the ideas of a home education versus a public standardized environment . 	0
WD	7025	And if any part of that made no sense , just point it out . 	0
WD	7026	I think putting a 4 year old on kindergarten is more about the parents need to prove how superior their child is than it is about what is best for the child Or , more likely , it ' s a low to middle income parent , and they ' d rather send the child to school than pay for another year of daycare while they work . 	0
WD	7027	Neither of these scenarios were true for me . 	0

WD	7031	The evidence wasn ’ t very good then for a gap between the genders ’ learning styles so significant that it would mandate separate instruction , and it hasn ’ t gotten any better . 	0
WD	7032	Of course there are psychological and intellectual differences between men and women , but meta-analyses of the best studies show that those differences are relatively small , that there is a great deal of variability among individuals , and that , as the neuroscientist Lise Eliot writes , “ fundamentally , men and women are more similar than different . ” 	0

WD	7034	Men were hardwired for sleeping around and math , women for monogamy and English . 	0
WD	7035	Most people didn ’ t know much about brain science , but that didn ’ t stop them from trotting out vaguely recalled findings based on a handful of M . R . I . s showing that men and women thought differently . 	0
WD	7036	In one way , the fashion in single-sex classrooms has not changed at all . 	0
WD	7037	“ Math class is tough ! ” as that infamous talking Barbie complained . 	0
WD	7038	I remembered all this last week when I read about a new trend toward single-sex classrooms . 	0
WD	7039	Only about a dozen public schools were trying them in 2002 , but since the Department of Education relaxed its rules on gender-segregated classrooms , in 2006 , about five hundred public schools across the country have adopted them , according to an A . P . story . 	0
WD	7040	In May , the A . C . L . U . sent cease-and-desist letters to school districts in Alabama , Maine , Mississippi , West Virginia , and Virginia that have been separating boys and girls for academic instruction . 	0
WD	7041	Any personal experiences to share ? 	0
WD	7042	What do you think about kindergarten redshirting ? 	0
WD	7043	A lot of the academic stuff evens itself out by 3rd grade . 	0
WD	7044	Some kids take longer to learn subjects and it doesn ’ t necessarily mean they ’ re less smart than , say , kids who learned to read a year earlier . 	0
WD	7045	My child goes to public school , and if the school starts to suck then guess what I ' ll send her to private school to get a better education Because sometimes you just can ' t fix stupid ! 	1
WD	7046	If my daughters can be in an environment that celebrates girls as intelligent , creative individuals , without the boy craziness ( and reducing of one ' s self to something befitting a boy ' s attention ) , than I will take it . 	0
WD	7047	No , you are not a " bad " person if you send your kids to private school . 	0
WD	7048	Most public schools cannot handle really " bright " kids . 	0
WD	7049	This is especially true at the elementary school level where they have to teach to the middle at best and the lower achieving kids most of the time . 	0
WD	7050	Why ? 	0
WD	7051	They have to teach to the test , so their focus is making sure their kids will pass the standardized tests that are given . 	0
WD	7052	Kids that are really bright , quick learners , etc . get bored and in a lot of cases start acting up . 	0

WD	7055	Homeschooling is one of the ways we can fight back . 	0
WD	7056	He would have been bored going over the same things and not getting challenged . 	0
WD	7057	We live in a day of under-protective parenting . 	0
WD	7058	It ’ s what lets you pick their friends and control the nature , speed and context of their broader socialization . 	0
WD	7059	It ’ s what lets you insulate them from the world before their maturity is ready to engage it on their own . 	0
WD	7060	It ’ s what allows you to optimally shape their spiritual life , and pour into it without contest during those years when there should be no contest . 	0
WD	7061	I hope and pray and that every parent will consider homeschooling their child at least through the most pivotal years , which to my thinking , is late elementary and middle school years . 	0
WD	7062	I cannot say this strongly enough . 	0
WD	7063	We had to have a GED or a degree from a correspondence school . 	0
WD	7064	Having multiple inclusion kids in a classroom can slow a class down . 	0
WD	7065	A little flexibility like that is fine but I think it would be easy to go over board . 	0
WD	7066	I have sent my son to private schools so that he could avoid the negative elements of society . 	0
WD	7067	Homeschool was very different when I was in school . 	0
WD	7068	What a waste of time and money and takes a very short view of life long goals of independence . . 	0
WD	7069	I ' m dumbfounded these parents would deny their children an education - or one that is so insufficient they require three years of remedial-college to simply be able to attend another 4 year university . 	0
WD	7070	It wouldn ' t work anyhow . 	0
WD	7071	We ’ re working on such things and , in recent weeks , I ’ ve noticed a ton of positive changes in Ryan . 	0
WD	7072	A recent survey in Ghana found that of 450 children enrolled in low-cost , private schools , 449 were previously enrolled in government-subsidised schools – those schools that will now suffer as a result of poor investment . 	0
WD	7073	Yet there is a consistent failure on the part of local authorities and government reviews to grasp even the basis of the ideas that can underlie a different kind of education . 	0
WD	7074	Evidence including our own suggests strongly that this kind of education prepares children to enter further and higher education , or the workforce – and offers them the freedom to learn in the ways that suit them best . 	0
WD	7075	We have half-a-year which means A LOT can change before kindergarten ( besides , since when did kids have to be perfect for kindergarten ? ) . 	0
WD	7076	It is here that home educators have their strongest reservations . 	0
WD	7077	And , most insidious of all , if the law were changed , social workers and education professionals would presumably be expected to monitor the quality of education provided . 	0
WD	7078	Research by ourselves at the University of London ' s Institute of Education has shown how diverse individual learners are , and therefore the diversity of ways in which their needs can best be met . 	0
WD	7079	Education at home is nothing like education at school . 	1
WD	7080	Styles of education can change between children and over time , bringing a flexibility and dynamism that would be impossible in a formal setting . 	0
WD	7081	Home education can range from the highly structured , based on set curriculums and lessons , to the completely informal . 	0
WD	7082	That school should be the benchmark against which all education is measured is resented by many home educators . 	0
WD	7083	While officials talk the language of individualism and chances for everybody , home educators are in a position to deliver precisely that kind of tailor-made education . 	0
WD	7084	After more than 25 years of severe moral decline is it not time to repent , reverence the name of the Lord , reinstitute and keep the third commandment ? 	0
WD	7085	I believe everyone deserves an education , and much more than the 12 years we get , but I also believe I have a choice to do what I feel is best for my children ! 	0
WD	7086	As a matter of fact , as a homeowner , I am supporting both systems , much more than those less fortunate can . 	0
WD	7087	You actively , with forethought , work to deny your child an education ? 	0
WD	7088	Just a thought - the way it works in my community is REAL ESTATE TAXES fund our public schools . 	0
WD	7089	Therefore I am not taking ANYTHING away from the public school system by sending my sons to private school . 	0
WD	7090	It would be silly to sacrifice him to public schools to make them better . 	0
WD	7091	In recent years , the biggest gains in education occurred when governments eliminated user fees to deliver on the right to education , leading to tens of millions of children enrolling in school for the first time , and supporting low-cost private schools mocks the importance of that evidence . 	0
WD	7092	It comes from 2 Chronicles 7 : 14 which is summarized as “ If we pray , seek , turn ; then God hears , forgives , heals . ” 	0
WD	7093	As I moved from middle school into high school , my friends moved from homeschool to public school . 	0
WD	7094	* He ’ s in the 90th percentile for height and weight so he runs no risk of being picked on for smallness . 	0
WD	7095	The article is written from the professor ' s perspective and he writes about his experience in teaching Jonas and some of the issues that he felt Jonas dealt with in the class . 	0
WD	7096	In the article , the professor describes the first day of class and how Jonas asked him if there would be a paper required for the course in which the professor responded that was how the previous course was taught and that he would solicit the thoughts of the class and he noticed how Jonas ' demeanor changed with his answer . 	0
WD	7097	Granted , public education , like most other government programs , is corrupt at it ' s core and an administrative nightmare , it needs to be completely overhauled , but the fact remains that the populace needs to be educated and if not forced by law , a lot of parents simply wouldn ' t bother , paying for their kid ' s education gets in the way of the new car and the designer jeans . 	1
WD	7098	If you come out on the other side deficient , it ’ s hard to make up for that . 	0
WD	7099	There are many elements that come into play when mainstreaming special education students into regular education settings . 	0
WD	7100	Teachers will need to educate themselves so they can learn different strategies to teach two diverse groups , exceptional students and " regular " students , in the same classroom . 	0
WD	7101	The inclusive classroom is different in that the individualized styles of learning and needs of the students fall outside the normal parameter . 	0
WD	7102	Sometimes it is not only the teacher that is resistant but the exceptional students as well are resistant to the change in educational setting because they are used to being separated from the mainstream of school life . 	0
WD	7103	This is where teamwork will become important between the school , the students , and the teachers . 	0
WD	7104	The inclusive classroom is a different dynamic so everyone will have to adjust but the transition will be easier with cooperation from everyone . 	0
WD	7105	I read an article on a particular student named Jonas , a previous special education high school student , and his experience in a college setting . 	0
WD	7106	Jonas is presently a special education assistant or para-professional in a urban high school and he is taking the undergraduate course , Critical Issues in School , to complete his degree . 	0
WD	7107	Second , special education students typically have some modifications or accommodations written in their Individualized Education Plan . 	0
WD	7108	For a special education student , this is magnified tremendously . 	0
WD	7109	Traditional students also try to refrain from asking questions in class because they don ' t want to look dumb . 	0
WD	7110	I say that because I love my country and it really bothers me to see our politicians drag us down further and further in to the abyss . 	0
WD	7111	When classes are filled with 36 to 40 students per class , one-on-one instruction becomes impossible . 	0
WD	7112	In addition , special education students tend to need more one-on-one instruction without distractions . 	0
WD	7113	This means that the students choose to take the test in class — and have attention drawn to them because they get special treatment in other students eyes — or they take their test in the testing center where they can have more privacy . 	0
WD	7114	Oftentimes , their plan allows them to use notes , a calculator and / or textbooks on tests . 	0
WD	7115	I pay taxes that go to the local school system that my children don ' t attend on both my residential property and business properties and I pay the private school tuition . 	0
WD	7116	And as a parent of two " youngest in the class " , I wonder if these redshirt parents ' choice will be subjecting other children , who ' s parents followed the rules , to a school life of struggling to keep up with classmates that should actually be in another class ? 	0
WD	7117	I have always taken time to help as many students as possible , both traditional and special education students . 	0
WD	7118	Lastly , special education teachers catch on quickly which traditional teachers are going to take the time to help the kids on their case load . 	0
WD	7119	Redshirting - does it really buy your child a long-term advantage in school and in life ? 	0
WD	7120	We choose to be the primary influence in our children ’ s life and know it is the right decision for our family . 	0
WD	7121	In fact , the National Home Education Research Institute disclosed that the 36 to 54 hours that students spend in school-related weekly activities make peers and adults outside of the home the primary influences in children ' s lives - not the parents . 	0
WD	7122	But lack of socialization for homeschoolers is really just a myth that holds no weight and is not a valid reason to not consider homeschooling . 	0
WD	7123	Each parent and family must make the decision to do what is best for them whether it be public school or homeschool . 	0
WD	7124	Mr . Safer also failed to examine the long-term effects of redshirting on children as the proceed thru their academic life . 	0
WD	7125	I sure hope somebody is out there studying these old , bigger , more mature students as they progress thru their school years ? 	0
WD	7126	I was all alone my freshmen year , by my senior year , there were enough high school homeschoolers to count on two hands . 	0
WD	7127	I think the best way to get Public schools to be better and for the system to be fairer is for parents to be given vouchers for the amount public schools would receive for your child ' s education and for the parents to have a choice of where to send their children . 	0
WD	7128	I think that where inclusion is being considered , it has to be carefully planned to meet the childs needs . 	0
WD	7129	Just because the vast majority of home educators are good , loving and decent parents cannot mean that the few children at risk *must* be ignored to give you all privacy . 	0
WD	7130	The subjects were deemed too difficult to teach at home . 	0
WD	7131	Public schools will never get better until they have competition . 	0
WD	7132	so my kids should suffer for the school systems down fall while we figure it out . . . . news flash change takes time and you only have kids in school for a short time . . . . 	0
WD	7133	I wish . 	0
WD	7134	No one is claiming " the professionals " are the only ones who can teach . 	0
WD	7135	Teachers in schools are also subject to intrusive checks , the assumption that they would abuse a child as soon as look at them and constant surveillance . 	0
WD	7136	I will always be happy they were happy there , despite my misery . 	0
WD	7137	And so children die . 	0
WD	7138	If no one is checking up , no one has noticed their child ' s bruises and withdrawal and misery . 	0
WD	7139	So , some parents take their children out of school and abuse them so they do not get caught . 	0
WD	7140	What this is about is when a child is being abused by parents , teachers notice and they report it . 	0
WD	7141	It is just a Get of Jail Free card to a very small minority of people . 	0
WD	7142	It is not a widespread problem , no one is claiming that . 	0
WD	7143	There is no way to tell who any of us would have been different without having the experience . 	0
WD	7144	Public schools have failed at their purpose because they have lost their purpose . 	0
WD	7145	Comes up in conversation ? 	0
WD	7146	I don ' t hide it . 	0
WD	7147	" they want to put her in G&T " -- now seriously , it ' s not jealousy - my ODD is identified gifted and I don ' t brag to the world about it . 	0
WD	7148	It ' s our deal . 	0
WD	7149	Got one friend who held her kid back in K because she was immature ( August birthday ) . 	0
WD	7150	Now she ' s in 2nd and all I hear is " she ' s so smart " " she ' s bored . " 	0
WD	7151	But this holding them back because they are immature ? 	1
WD	7152	No way - not a good reason IMO . . . because they will grow up , , they will mature . 	1
WD	7153	Also has anyone considered that maybe the reason many " redshirted " kids to not do as well academically is because their parents waited a year to start them because they did not feel they were ready and maybe they are just not academic performers . 	0
WD	7154	I ' m all for redshirting kids who are not academically ready . 	0
WD	7155	Nope , public school not for me ! 	1
WD	7156	Who in their right mind would want their children to have to rely on an education from one of those to prepare them for life ? 	0
WD	7157	You ' ve got to be kidding . 	0
WD	7158	The public school system the way it is now is not an option . 	1
WD	7159	Plus , I live in a right wing state whose legislators take books out of libraries on religious grounds and who tried to remove teaching the theory of evolution . 	0
WD	7160	This is still a country where your successes do provide some benefits . 	0
WD	7161	Education is one . 	0
WD	7162	I hope that the government doesn ' t make that impossible to . 	0
WD	7163	Just look at public schools . 	0
WD	7164	If you want what is best for your child , you ' ll send them to a private school . 	1
WD	7165	I think the idea that sending all children to public schools is a poor way to bring public education up to grade . 	0
WD	7166	Most would say , not at the expense of my child , and they would be right . 	0
WD	7167	The entire socialist mentality has no place here in the United States . 	0
WD	7168	I am going to be starting a single sex school but am not intimidated by this at all , as it was not just my parents choice but mine too , alot of people I know quite well go there and enjoy it tremendisly . 	0
WD	7169	Its just a debate that has two extremely good arguments on both sides 	0
WD	7170	Not sure how it would have turned out if we ' d sent him straight through , but I can attest that he is a leader in all things he does – athletically , professionally , and socially . 	0
WD	7171	Testimony : My son , now 25 , was held back by going to Transitional first grade ( T1 ) . 	0
WD	7172	I believe that his going the T1 route was a part of what worked for us . 	0
WD	7173	He was awarded a full athletic college scholarship ; voted captain of his team by his teammates for three years , and earned another scholarship to get his masters ; and had several generous job offers to choose from upon graduating . 	0
WD	7174	I know it ' s a tough decision to make – best of luck to those trying to make the decision , I know its tough and is different for each child . 	0
WD	7175	I am a loving , knowledgeable , intelligent and successful individual that wants to do all that I can to prepare my children and give them a great life . 	0
WD	7176	These parents are paying for public schools as well with tax dollars . 	0
WD	7177	People sending their kids to private schools and homeschooling actual helps the public schools . 	0
WD	7178	By helping pay for it , but not sending their children there , they are increasing the amount of funds that are available per student . 	0
WD	7179	Constitutionally , Canada has no religion , although some mistakenly believe we are a Christian nation even though legally that argument has no ground . 	0
WD	7180	Lets keep it that way . 	0
WD	7181	There is no place for religion in schools nor should taxpayers subsidize any religion ' s prayer services . 	1
WD	7182	I do not care if the person is Christian , Muslim , Jewish , Hindu , Zorastrian , Buddhist , Jainist , Wiccan , Protestant , Catholic , Orthodox , or Pagan their beliefs belong in premises financed by their believers not the government . 	0
WD	7183	My decision was based solely on those points as found by our exhaustive research of what was available to us in our area . 	0
WD	7184	Allowing prayer in schools leads to prosetylization and that is unacceptable . 	0
WD	7185	Nobody needs to be practicing religion at a public school . 	1
WD	7186	The whole point is to separate education from religion . 	0
WD	7187	If you want your kid learning and praying in the same place then send them to a religious school . 	0
WD	7188	if you had to do something and be child free during that time , the munchkins went to gramma or the teenage girl 3 doors down the block . 	0
WD	7189	your kid turned 5 , you sent them to KINDERGARTEN , boom , done . 	0
WD	7190	too often , parents are doing it because it ' s the done thing now , not because they have any sense that it will actually benefit their child ; someone said it was a good idea , so they did it . we didn ' t put our daughter in day care , pre-school , or 4K ; ppl thought we were nuts . 	0
WD	7191	now , parents do all this crap to give their kids a leg up , get them ahead of their peers , send them to umpteen different activities , get them in pre-school , and now this redshirting thing . 	0
WD	7192	dept . on the cheap , the dance classes , soccer , softball , on and on ad nauseum . 	0
WD	7193	this idea that kids need just one more year to be a kid . . . perhaps for some parents , there ' s some truth to it . when i was a kid , back in the dark ages , there wasn ' t day care , pre-school , 4 year old kindergarten , we didn ' t have all these things kids can do via the rec . 	0
WD	7194	there wasn ' t even the designation of 5K ; there was just KINDERGARTEN . 	0
WD	7195	when i was a kid , i was allowed to be a kid until kindergarten , where my mother had the choice of half day or full day kindergarten . 	0
WD	7196	There are many religions that do not pray to their gods , and some that don ' t have any gods whatsoever . 	0
WD	7197	2 ) The 1st amendment clearly establishes ( heh heh get it ) that the government may not sponsor a religion . 	0
WD	7198	One of the biggest myths about homeschooled kids is that they are poorly socialized . 	0
WD	7199	A study by the Canadian Center for Home Education found homeschooled young people at 15-34 years of age more socially engaged ( 67% ) compared with their public school educated peers ( 44% ) . 	0
WD	7200	It ' s not . 	0
WD	7201	4 ) It forces children to think that religion is okay . 	0
WD	7202	Prayer is solely religious in nature . 	0
WD	7203	3 ) Not only that , but the 1st amendment has been interpreted to mean that the government may not sponsor religion in general . 	0
WD	7204	I found it fascinating that homeschooled children , who are not being taught to the test , on the whole do much better than their public school counterparts . 	0
WD	7205	The statistics showing the higher test scores may be skewed because parents of homeschooled kids are not required to take or report scores for standardized tests in many states . 	0
WD	7206	Homeschooled students do have more time to pursue extracurricular activities as opposed to their exhausted public school peers . 	0
WD	7207	Teachers teach to the test because that is what they are instructed to do by administrations that are under pressure for government funding . 	0
WD	7208	Some parents bring in tutors or enroll their children in enrichment programs driving up the cost . 	0
WD	7209	Many parents recycle curriculum among siblings , get groups together for the group rate when visiting museums , and get free materials from the library or online to cut costs . 	0
WD	7210	In public school everyone must take standardized tests and schools must report the scores . 	0
WD	7211	The cost of homeschooling varies widely . 	0
WD	7212	It really is that simple . 	0
WD	7213	But the state ( including the public schools ) cannot mandate , sponsor , conduct , or otherwise officially sanction prayer . 	1
WD	7214	Private individuals can pray whenever and wherever they want ; no one ’ s personal freedoms are being abridged in this regard . 	1
WD	7215	( They can ’ t even offer to lead purely “ voluntary ” prayers with an “ opt out ” option for non-praying students ; that ’ s still a form of religious participation and support , on an official basis , by the state — which is flatly unconstitutional ) . 	0
WD	7216	Ergo , public schools ( e . g . , the state ) may not lead or conduct prayers . 	0
WD	7217	U . S . public schools , being government-run and taxpayer-supported , are part of “ the state . ” 	0
WD	7218	The state may not establish , endorse , promote , sponsor , or conduct prayers . 	0
WD	7219	Individuals may freely exercise their religion of choice , and give free expression to their own private religious preferences ; however , the state cannot do likewise ( because the U . S . Constitution also mandates that the state may not promote , endorse , or otherwise “ establish ” religion ) . 	0
WD	7220	However , teachers on duty in public schools are not acting as private individuals , but as employees ( and hence representatives ) of the state . 	0
WD	7221	It is sometimes objected that teachers ’ rights of religious expression and free speech are being violated , if they are forbidden to lead students in prayer . 	0
WD	7222	However , when they want to pray out loud or with a group , I consider that a disruption and therefore not acceptable . 	0
WD	7223	While one child may be an extreme extrovert and need to be surrounded by students and in a classroom , another may be an extreme introvert , overwhelmed and anxious in the classroom . 	0
WD	7224	The private and Catholic schools were grew out of the need created because the public schools sucked " first " . 	0
WD	7225	If the failing public schools were to suddenly get better because the parents whose kids are ' stuck ' there demanded better , likely the parents of private school kids would put their kids back in public schools . 	0
WD	7226	If the problems could be solved by more involved parents ( and a majority of them probably can be ) , then put the onus on the remaining parents to rise up and get more involved . 	0
WD	7227	You ' re blaming people who choose to walk away in disgust ( often while paying tax money ANYWAY to subsidize failure ) yet ignoring the obvious . 	0
WD	7228	IF this were true , then why don ' t the parents whose kids ARE in the public school system work to improve it ? 	0
WD	7229	They deserve better . 	0
WD	7230	If the atmosphere in the school is right , if the pastoral care excellent than I feel that the co-ed environment creates a vibrant , exciting , stimulating school but also a more relaxed and less stressful climate . 	0
WD	7231	As a boy in a boarding school myself many years ago , which was single sex until A levels , the arrival of girls in the sixth form was the worst possible distraction to teenage boys about to embark serious exams . 	0
WD	7232	Girls also feel the pressure of exam much more than boys and in their teenage years exam pressure can become very intense with often very serious negative consequences . 	0
WD	7233	My experience in a secondary co-ed is that the co-ed situation does deflect some of this tension . 	0
WD	7234	But in my opinion it should be from 2-18 . 	0
WD	7235	Boys and girls perhaps learn differently and approach work in different ways . 	0
WD	7236	If a school is aware of this and teachers can adapt styles and vary their teaching strategies – I see co-eds as both a more natural and realistic preparation for the fast approaching lesson of adult life . 	1
WD	7237	This can cause children to not experience as much about society and those different from them as they would in a public or private school setting . 	0
WD	7238	Experiences are left out of childhood that could have been gained through attendance at school in a multicultural classroom . 	0
WD	7239	Finances Finances can be difficult for families when children are homeschooled . 	0
WD	7240	With one parent teaching children in the comfort of your own home , the other is left to be sole " breadwinner , " and that can place a burden on a family ' s budget . 	0
WD	7241	Many schools also provide a free lunch to students in order to aid families during this tough economic time , something that cannot be offered while homeschooling . 	0
WD	7242	Isolation from Differences Children are isolated from differences in race , ethnicity , age and culture when being homeschooled . 	0
WD	7243	Ideally , I don ’ t think school children should spend as much time as they usually do isolated by age , let alone sex . 	1
WD	7244	The unhealthiest social situations I was ever in were an all-boys school and military training . 	0
WD	7245	In a rough analogy to monocultural farming , I think than any highly homogeneous group of people , while it offers certain efficiencies , is inherently pathology prone . 	0
WD	7246	Diversity damps extremes of outlook , need and behavior . 	0
WD	7247	She compares the push toward mainstreaming students from special education classes to the 1980s movement to downsize mental health institutes , which resulted in an increase in homelessness because individuals could no long receive needed supports . 	0

WD	7249	Dr . Densmore doesn ’ t believe that holding kids back from kindergarten entry is the total solution . 	0
WD	7250	Lesson plans ( and the national curriculum ) are the death of real education . 	0
WD	7251	Others may differ , but I always think , isn ’ t high school supposed to transition you into the world , college , and life on your own ? 	0
WD	7252	Girls were said to be hitting a self-esteem barrier in junior high , when they would droop like Ophelias in need of reviving . 	0
WD	7253	The reformers ’ talk was all about “ How Schools Shortchange Girls ” ( the title of a much-discussed report from the American Association of University Women ) or were “ Failing at Fairness ” ( the title of a 1994 book ) for young women . 	0
WD	7254	My view on the subject is no . 	1
WD	7255	and I actually do feel like co-ed schools develop a girl better socially and emotionally than all-girls schools , just from the mere fact that a girl will get to interact with boys on a daily basis . 	0
WD	7256	As Halpern and her co-authors point out , there are some excellent single-sex programs , and some can point to real gains , but often these can be attributed to selection bias—the children involved were more committed students—and to the motivation and sense of mission among teachers and staff . 	0
WD	7257	In an article called , bluntly , “ The Pseudoscience of Single-Sex Schooling , ” which was co-authored by Diane Halpern , a research psychologist at Claremont McKenna college , and published in Science magazine this fall , Halpern et al . conclude that “ there is no well-designed research showing that single-sex education improves students ’ academic performance . ” 	0
WD	7258	A woman whose daughters attend one of the West Virginia middle schools with boys ’ and girls ’ classes contributed an article this week to the A . C . L . U . Web site in which she pointed out that her school ’ s all-male classes operated on the humane assumption that many kids concentrate better if they ’ re permitted to move about a bit . 	0
WD	7259	When I was reporting on single-sex education experiments in the nineties , one of the things I noticed was that teaching methods enthusiastically billed as better for girls , like hands-on science demonstrations , or mixing word problems in with more standard equations , would be better for anyone without a natural bent for math or science . 	0
WD	7260	She thought , reasonably enough , that some girls might benefit from a little of the same freedom . 	0
WD	7261	In the boys ’ classes , students could lounge in beanbag chairs and run around outside sometimes to “ blow off steam . ” 	0
WD	7262	In the nineties , it was girls . 	0
WD	7263	What has changed since the nineties is the notion of who single-sex education is supposed to help most . 	0
WD	7264	We should make the public system as good as possible for those who can ' t afford it but if parents want their kids to get a better education than the system provides don ' t stop them . 	0
WD	7265	I went to a private school and the public system could never have given me the same experience and quality education . 	0

WD	7267	He enjoys his preschool activities but if he had to do everything over again , I envision lots of fussing about going to school . 	0
WD	7268	Mornings would be ugly . 	0
WD	7269	Besides , the biggest detriment of preschool boredom is associating disinterest with school . 	0
WD	7270	No one wants a kid to develop the habit of tuning out . 	0
WD	7271	Ryan also is like me in that he ’ s observant and listening intensely , although if you didn ’ t know him , or me , you might think we ’ re not paying attention . 	0
WD	7272	But trust me , we have mentally filed away every detail of interest and can almost recite word-for-word what was said . 	0
WD	7273	Here ’ s another thing : A bored Ryan is trouble waiting to happen . 	0
WD	7274	I cannot imagine him spending a year not moving forward with his learning . 	0
WD	7275	They pay most , if not all of the taxes that support the socialistic schools . 	0
WD	7276	Just who do you think pays for the schools ? 	0
WD	7277	A very few excel , but they are the type who would have exceled even without schooling , so they exceled in spite of public schools . 	0
WD	7278	I went to both single sex and co-ed high schools , and I feel the later made it easier to build cross gender friendships that weren ' t just hormone driven . 	0
WD	7279	I believe that envy is one of the carnal sins . 	0
WD	7280	It ' d be good to read up on the literature . 	0
WD	7281	My first thoughts are that it would be more likely to produce an objectified view even with regular cross school events . 	0
WD	7282	Yes , private school is expensive but not every parent that sends their kid to private school is well to do . 	0
WD	7283	My husband and I both work and make good money , but allowing him to go to private school took some thought in regards to our budget . 	0
WD	7284	I suggest reading a blog I wrote earlier this year titled “ Parents , Sports and Church . ” 	0
WD	7285	All I would add to its words would be that as someone who played competitive sports himself at almost every level , and saw my homeschooled kids engage them at almost every level as well , it ’ s a red herring . 	0
WD	7286	I have two children . 	0

WD	7290	She excels in public school . 	0
WD	7291	My son who at the end of his Freshman year had a GPA of 3 . 8 excelled as well but he was stressed out for 90% of the year because of the classroom sizes . 	0
WD	7292	He would come home so frustrated because the teacher spent most of the class trying to get everyone to focus and pay attention that by the time the bell rang to go to the next class they were left to figure out the lesson for the day on their own or go to tutoring after school which is what he would do . 	0
WD	7293	Others may feel they are not qualified or temperamentally suited to the task . 	0

WD	7306	these few children who are really JUST not ready for prime time , maybe i can see it , IF these kids are doing something to help them in w / e area they are lacking , but to do it for sports , or just because they need that one extra year to " just be a kid " ? 	0

WD	7309	If Muslims are required by their religion to pray several ( is it 6 ? ) times a day , and this space is being allotted so the Muslim youth can practice their religion properly . . . why is this prayer only being conducted once per week ? 	0
WD	7310	This timetable would seem in opposition of what their faith demands . 	0
WD	7311	I am convinced more satisfaction is gained from the fact that they will be allowed to halfheartedly practice their faith in a public school rather than actually practicing their faith properly an a place of worship . 	0
WD	7312	And boo hiss on any Canadian institution that would allow discrimination against gender to be practiced on tax-payer funded property . 	0
WD	7313	She is repeating 3rd grade this year and is having a much better time of it , not just academically , but also socially . 	0
WD	7314	The school was reluctant to retain her and told us this was rarely done , but we know this was the best decision we ever could have made . 	1
WD	7315	They have since then transitioned into public schools and ( from my distant vantage point ) seem to be doing fine . 	0

WD	7343	He isn ' t bored , and despite my greatest worries , the other kids are nice to him and he has friends . 	0
WD	7344	He was in special ed preschool for 2 years , and special ed kindergarten for one year , and he ' s doing so much better in his 1st grade class . 	0
WD	7345	His teacher brought in someone to teach some signs , so now everyone can communicate . 	0
WD	7346	I highly recommend a co-ed school . 	1
WD	7347	With the voucher system in place public schools will forced to compete for the same money , hence public school will be forced to improve the way they preform ! 	0
WD	7348	However , voluntary , non-disruptive , silent prayer is fine . 	1
WD	7349	Just getting rid of public schools isn ' t going to get rid of problem students and SOMEONE is going to have to deal with them . 	0
WD	7350	I know because I was one of those kids . 	0
WD	7351	Many of these kids then go on to underachieve in middle and high school because their initial experiences left them bored and as a result , often totally disinterested in school . 	0
WD	7352	She is a genius and is knowledgeable in the arts and in the sciences . 	0
WD	7353	My husband and I agreed , that if our son has to be held back , it will be when we ' re sure he ' s not keeping up with the kids and Pre-K is not that time . 	0
WD	7354	One major reason - God is not allowed in the public schools , but He is more than welcomed in the private ! 	0
WD	7355	The stereotype that home learners spend their days isolated from society at kitchen tables with workbooks in hand could be nothing but farther from reality . 	0
WD	7356	The practice is even more common in charter schools according to statistics . 	0
WD	7357	Our culture has declared war on children in so many ways . 	0
WD	7358	Let ’ s take a look at this . 	0
WD	7359	There seems to be a myth that homeschoolers do not receive proper socialization . 	0
WD	7360	This usually comes from people who do not understand homeschooling or those deeply involved in public education . 	0
WD	7361	In reality , the majority of homeschoolers are provided with plenty of social opportunities . 	0
WD	7362	There has been much discussion regarding homeschooling lately . 	0
WD	7363	He has had no problems so far in Kindergarten . 	0
WD	7364	As a homeschooling parent of five children for over a decade , the most frequent question I receive is , “ what about socialization ? ” 	0
WD	7365	A woman recently contacted me saying she desired to homeschool her child but the socialization issue was keeping her from doing so . 	0
WD	7366	Well , getting drunk before basketball games with kids who lived at the trailer park near my house did the same for me . 	0
WD	7367	Reading Walt Whitman in ninth grade changed the way you see the world ? 	0
WD	7368	As rotten as my school ’ s English , history , science , social studies , math , art , music , and language programs were , going to school with poor kids and rich kids , black kids and brown kids , smart kids and not-so-smart ones , kids with superconservative Christian parents and other upper-middle-class Jews like me was its own education and life preparation . 	0
WD	7369	I ' m happy with my choice and it was comforting to read this article of support for my decision . 	1
WD	7370	Take two things from this on your quest to become a better person : 1 ) Your child will probably do just fine without “ the best , ” so don ’ t freak out too much , but 2 ) do freak out a little more than my parents did—enough to get involved . 	0
WD	7371	( Can you imagine ? ) 	0
WD	7372	They sent me there because that ’ s where we lived , and they weren ’ t too worried about it . 	0
WD	7373	By the way : My parents didn ’ t send me to this shoddy school because they believed in public ed . 	0
WD	7374	My son turned 5 one week before the cut-off . 	0
WD	7375	Many of my ( morally bankrupt ) colleagues send their children to private schools . 	0
WD	7376	He is in a full day Kindergarten and seems to be doing well , considering he is the youngest in the class . 	0
WD	7377	In reality , children and teens are locked behind gates on campus , are segregated by age , are forced to remain silent in class unless called by the teacher , and whose schedules are determined by the blare of school bells . 	0
WD	7378	In contrast , a homeschooler ’ s “ classroom ” is the world around him / her . 	0
WD	7379	Parents don ’ t just limit teaching their children in the living or dining room . 	0
WD	7380	They hold lessons in parks , libraries or museums . 	0
WD	7381	However , Dr . Thomas Smedley debunked these assumptions when he did a study on homeschooled kids . 	0
WD	7382	Last year , his pre-school teacher recommended that I hold him back and keep him in Pre-K one more year . 	0
WD	7383	Homeschooled children scored very high in the 84th percentile compared to public school students who scored at an abysmal 23rd percentile . 	0
WD	7384	Public schools argue that their kids are better socialized . 	0
WD	7385	Pre-K was only 3 hours long , while Kindergarten was a full day . 	0
WD	7386	They take weekly field trips to places of interest in the community , including churches , colleges , hospitals , fire departments , city halls , and even repair shops . 	0
WD	7387	Indeed , parents ensure that their kids are able to interact with people of all ages , and not just with their peers . 	0
WD	7388	If you want to chat with your invisible , supernatural friend do so off school property and on your own time . 	0
WD	7389	Our education system ( as with our government ) must remain secular and free from these silly distractions . 	0
WD	7390	NO PRAYER IN SCHOOLS ! . . . period . 	1
WD	7391	While there are many arguments for homeschooling children , there are several reasons that parents might not want to pursue this educational option . 	0
WD	7392	This large step should be considered carefully before children are either homeschooled or enrolled at a public institution . 	0
WD	7393	Homeschooling allows children to move at their own learning pace , yet it can socially isolate them . 	0
WD	7394	Homeschooling is beneficial for some , but may not be right for every family . 	0
WD	7395	Also , teaching itself can be difficult , as parents usually haven ' t earned a degree in education and occasionally they don ' t even have any kind of post-secondary education . 	0
WD	7396	Social Networks Children who are homeschooled can lack the social interaction gained by having classmates . 	0
WD	7397	Teaching Many parents find the variety of choices and lesson plans that can be used for homeschooling overwhelming . 	0
WD	7398	Since there are no laid out plans for teaching , homeschooling can be a great deal of work for parents , and occasionally confusing for children . 	0
WD	7399	This can be difficult for children as they can be socially isolated unless parents create their own social groups through sports , extracurricular activities or religious organizations . 	0
WD	7400	The value of learning how to get along with others and develop social skills that will be needed throughout life is an important part of the education experience . 	0
WD	7401	My child changes every year and so will his needs . 	1
WD	7402	So bored ! 	0
WD	7403	NONE . 	0
WD	7404	I can ' t imagine tossing them into PreK again for another year . 	0
WD	7405	They would be so bored . 	0
WD	7406	My kids would be bored to tears in Kindergarten if we waited a year . 	0
WD	7407	As it is they already enter Kindy grade level comfortable in 1st grade math / 1-2nd grade reading level . 	0
WD	7408	I have seen it from all angles and am now seeing it from the parent ' s angle . 	1
WD	7409	Actually , my son had a homeschooled boy on his hockey team for several years . 	0
WD	7410	Home educated children are also more involved in their communities , as are adults who were homeschooled . 	0
WD	7411	The top reason my friends say they didn ’ t consider homeschooling is because they are sure their kids won ’ t listen to them . 	0
WD	7412	He socialized just fine and was exceptionally bright , though judging from his fascination with my garage door opener , seemed a bit sheltered . 	0
WD	7413	Many readers addressed this saying it ’ s a matter of discipline and good parenting . 	0
WD	7414	I have to say , I ’ m with them . 	0
WD	7415	Someone out there should start a consulting business teaching parents how to get their kids to listen to them while homeschooling . 	0
WD	7416	Although there is a huge homeschool community out there that makes it work , I still can ’ t imagine my boys cooperating . 	0
WD	7417	Christian prayer in schools is not a problem because the Christian holy day of the week is Sunday - a day when there is no school . 	0
WD	7418	He went in a boy and came out a god-loving man of character ! 	0
WD	7419	The subject of homeschool shouldn ' t open a firestorm of debate anymore than mentioning a child is going to public school opens a debate . 	0
WD	7420	This is after all a free country . 	0
WD	7421	It depends on what you think a Christian is . 	0
WD	7422	There are too many who try to use the government and our schools to force their religion on everyone . 	0
WD	7423	Not surpirsingly the worst behavior problems are lower potential and high potential students . 	0
WD	7424	But you are free to carry a Bible until you use it to violate the rights of others . 	0
WD	7425	Well , of course the whole Bible isn ' t mythology . 	0
WD	7426	There is some religious laws , there is a lot of poetry , there is some history , and there is a lot of mythology . 	0
WD	7427	How else should Genesis be characterized ? 	0
WD	7428	Nonsense . 	0
WD	7429	As an agent of the government you would be enjoined from giving the appearance that the government endorsed or supported a particular religion . 	0
WD	7430	I believe that there has been case law on the matter in which a teacher was dismissed for putting a Bible on the desk . 	0
WD	7431	Carry it in your brief case , but to take it out and place it promenently on the desk every day crosses the line . 	0
WD	7432	My child went to a private all boys school and it was the best thing I ever did ! 	1
WD	7433	As a teacher , this is a moral and ethical struggle for me . 	0
WD	7434	In public school , the parents nor the teachers have too much say in the government run institutions ! 	0
WD	7435	I don ' t know if I agree that a parent has to be super organized , so much as motivated . 	0
WD	7436	( though organization does help . ) 	0
WD	7437	This is why I work to support my family rather than work to support a random group of my fellow human beings . 	0
WD	7438	Ergo , if I have kids that I love and I live in a place with a crappy school district , you ' re damn right I ' m going to put them in a private school if I ' m able to do it . 	1
WD	7439	I ' m not going to ship them off to some crappy public just so I can use them as a tool for making a sociopolitical point . 	0
WD	7440	When preparing for a test , the boys may go for a run , or engage in some other activity , while the girls are more likely to do calming exercises , such as yoga . ” 	0
WD	7441	The writer is an idiot . 	0
WD	7442	As a responsible , rational , moral human being , I have a hierarchy of responsibility . 	0
WD	7443	I have a responsibility to my society but I also have a responsibility to my family . 	0
WD	7444	My responsibility to my family trumps my responsibility to society . 	0
WD	7445	I ’ m not saying it ’ s a good thing that I got a lame education . 	0
WD	7446	I think that as a parent you really have to commit to x amount of hours a day HAVE to be designated for school , and it is really easy to be like " Well , we ' ll get back on track tomorrow . " 	0
WD	7447	Girls thrive on team projects and collaboration ; boys on bright lights , loud voices , and competition . 	0
WD	7448	I ’ m saying that I survived it , and so will your child , who must endure having no AP calculus so that in 25 years there will be AP calculus for all . 	0
WD	7449	This year it may be homeschool . 	1
WD	7450	Isn ' t this an interesting country we live in when we have to justify practicing our religious freedoms ! 	0
WD	7451	In a study conducted by Dr . Michael Mitchell , traits for successful socialization in students include popularity among peers , aggressive competitiveness , pride and self-confidence , and a drive toward materialism . 	0
WD	7452	A second point to consider is that there is an obvious discrepancy between public school educators and homeschoolers on what traits define successful socialization . 	0
WD	7453	It ’ s amazing how much more emotionally mature a six year old is . 	0
WD	7454	With this in mind I feel it does no harm to wait till he ’ s six . 	1
WD	7455	You son sounds like he ’ s much more ready intelligence wise but not emotionally wise . 	0
WD	7456	He wasn ’ t ready for kindergarten though . 	0
WD	7457	I know my oldest was and it ’ s just now in the fourth grade that he ’ s really catching up to his peers . 	0
WD	7458	He sounds like he ’ s mostly ready , but like you said he would be one of the youngest in his class . 	0
WD	7459	I think you really have to know your own child . 	0
WD	7460	As I stated earlier , mainstream was the right move for me , however I do not regret my time spent in The Court . 	0
WD	7461	To my mind , this is not an issue with a quick fix solution , nor are there any definitive answers on what ’ s better for disabled children . 	0
WD	7462	This means that teachers can spend more time on each pupil , answering any questions or concerns they may have about the tasks set . 	0
WD	7463	In contrast , homeschoolers want their children to focus on building character and integrity , developing a sense of responsibility , and respect toward others – ideals of Christian living . 	0
WD	7464	So I would argue that all provision for disabled pupils ( and students ) needs defending whether its special schools , SEN ( special education needs ) departments in mainstream schools or learning support assistants . 	0
WD	7465	To that end , the ‘ integration vs . segregation ’ argument simply becomes an argument that is abstract and separate from reality . 	0
WD	7466	I feel that it is almost certain that ‘ special ’ education will always be necessary for some school-students and ultimately it is their needs which should form the focus of this debate . 	0
WD	7467	It provided me with the first steps in my education . 	0
WD	7468	I hope disabled people , carers , teachers and parents can consider this possibility the next time this debate arises . 	0
WD	7469	The drift toward private schools was predicted as far back at the mid 1980s when I first became a teacher . 	0
WD	7470	At public it ' s payment in full at private it ' s payment in full or pay the difference . 	0
WD	7471	It was said that a ' voucher system ' would eventually be put in place , where by the funding attached to each student would ' travel ' with the student . 	0
WD	7472	Not surprisingly , delinquent and antisocial behaviors are practically non-existent in homeschooled children . 	0
WD	7473	This meant that the public school funding would be dependent upon demand from the community . 	0
WD	7474	" If he ' s older , he won ' t be easily manipulated into drug use and malpractices like this . 	0
WD	7475	As a publicly educated teacher I was concerned about the genesis of ' schools of last resort ' . 	0
WD	7476	He might feel more confident dealing with older students , " she said . 	0
WD	7477	Just as Gibb made a choice depending on her son ' s emotional needs , Vela recommends that parents do the same . 	0
WD	7478	I don ' t necessarily think that social skills or academics should be a sole deciding factor when figuring out when to start school . 	0
WD	7479	If she was down one grade it wouldn ' t make much difference socially since she is SO far off , but she would be further ahead with academics , totally bored , and would have other issues there as a result . 	0
WD	7480	She is a 13 year-old 8th grader with a fall birthday who is at or above level academically . 	0
WD	7481	If my oldest was in the grade where she fits SOCIALLY she would be in 3rd or 4th . 	0
WD	7482	You will also always have someone at the top and at the bottom when it comes to academics . 	0
WD	7483	It doesn ' t matter what the cut-off date is , there will always be someone who falls into each of those categories whether they are one and the same or not . 	0
WD	7484	Someone always has to be the youngest and someone always has to be the most immature . 	0
WD	7485	Tracy Gibb , a mother , blogger of Less than Perfect , deliberately redshirted her son because she thought he was emotionally immature . 	0
WD	7486	My wife and I also wanted our daughter to receive an education in Christ and that ' s a big reason we sent her to Christian private school . 	0
WD	7487	I often spent 20 mins of each year 9 lesson getting the boys to stop aggravating the ADHD boy , as he would then " blow " , much to the amusement of everyone . 	0
WD	7488	Certain schools by us have opened the doors to ESL , and now every lowlife transfers to the great school and destroys the curriculum at that school . 	0
WD	7489	" When he complains about his friend , I always try to remind him that he is one year younger than him and that he was doing the same things last year , " Gibb told ABCNews . com . 	0
WD	7490	Gibb still thinks she made the right choice not only because her son was " emotionally immature , " but also because she did not want him to join high school or college at a very young age . 	0
WD	7491	GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE EDUCATION PROCESS . 	0
WD	7492	YOU WANT TO FIX THE PATHETIC PUBLIC SCHOOLS . . . . 	0
WD	7493	I guess I choose to be a bad person and go with private schooling . 	1
WD	7494	So lets see I have a choice of sending my kids to a private school ; or better yet of homeschooling them and raising intelligent indivuals who can think for themselves and make intelligent decisions when they become adults or I can send them to public schools and play a role in raising more federal libtard zombies who question nothing and can carry on the torch of the last two generations of people destroying this once great country . 	0
WD	7495	The hell with do they know how to read , write , etc . The question is do you agree with the homosexual agenda , do you 5th graders know how to put on a condom , Christianity is evil but don ' t hurt the sweet people of Isam ' s feeling because after all they are part of the religion of peace . 	0
WD	7496	Should I send my kids to school where they can learn NOT how to READ , WRITE , SPELL , do MATH , SCIENCE , HISTORY , but learn how to think the way the Liberal federal government wants them too . 	0
WD	7497	Lets see here . 	0
WD	7498	Hmmm . . . . 	0
WD	7499	there ' s no social advantage at all ; the best place to learn to be social with kids of all ages is a school ! 	0
WD	7500	there ' s no academic advantage to keeping your kid out of school for an extra year , if all you do is put them in some kind of kiddie college , or if you won ' t or can ' t teach them on your own . 	0
WD	7501	all this pressure i see on other kids , and where ' s the benefit ? 	0
WD	7502	she takes one dance class , 45 minutes every saturday , because she asked if she could , not because i think it ' s good for much of anything ; she likes to dance and maybe she ' ll learn to not be such a clod . 	0
WD	7503	i am in the somewhat , these days , enviable position of being a stay at home mom , and i am a nerdy book worm , so it ' s easy enough for me to fill her time at home with education , and in such a way that she doesn ' t think she ' s being taught , ha ha sneaky mom . 	0
WD	7504	what DO you do , if you hold them back that first year ? 	0
WD	7505	the flip side is the parents who HAVE to put their kids in day care and pre-school , because they both work , and how many of them really find that their kids are SO much better off when they finally start school ? 	0
WD	7506	how many of the redshirted kids have parents who can do that , as opposed to paying for extracurricular programs ? 	0
WD	7507	but , no , i don ' t see it . if you want your kid to just be a kid , DON ' T put them in all these activities , unless they ASK to do them . 	0
WD	7508	i have not found one study that shows any tangible benefit to redshirting , and yes , i have looked , because it made no sense to me when i first heard of it , but i thought maybe there was some validity to the idea just the same . 	0
WD	7509	But , say a classmate has died . 	0
WD	7510	If the government actually spent money on the school system instead of other things that would be different . 	0
WD	7511	If prayer really works , then students might turn to God and come to know His love and forgiveness . 	0
WD	7512	Alliance Defending Freedom stands with See You at the Pole and with every student who desires to call upon the name of God . 	0
WD	7513	My husband helped update plumbing . 	0
WD	7514	If prayer didn ’ t work , then a group of students gathering around a flagpole early in the morning to talk to God would pose no threat . 	0
WD	7515	If prayer didn ’ t work , then FFRF would not find it “ unfortunate ” that students are encouraged to “ reach out to [ their ] classmates who do not know God ’ s love and forgiveness . ” 	0
WD	7516	In 2006 , then Education Secretary Margaret Spellings eased federal regulations on the policy , allowing schools to offer single-sex classrooms and schools so as long as these options are completely voluntary . 	0
WD	7517	If prayer really works , then it is a threat to those who would seek to corrupt a generation of students into embracing a godless worldview . 	0
WD	7518	The theme of this year ’ s See You at the Pole is #IFTHEN . 	0
WD	7519	And during a moment of silence , cannot some students pray and others reflect ? 	0
WD	7520	To FFRF and groups like it , the threat of prayer at school is the “ then . ” 	0
WD	7521	The threat is that when students pray , then God responds . 	0
WD	7522	The say and decisions are directed by leader of the system who reports to the state education system . . . not to parents . 	0
WD	7523	As such this leaves little room for parental suggestion let alone parental say in the class . 	0
WD	7524	This is where money talks , if you want to make a change or have a say in your child ' s education this will take either you teaching them yourself or paying someone else to teach them the way you believe is best ( private school ) . 	1
WD	7525	The author assumes parents can change a public system . 	0
WD	7526	The flaw . 	0
WD	7527	If it were the ins and outs of the school would be to serve the parents . . it is not it is to serve and teach the children . 	0
WD	7528	This is not so . 	0
WD	7529	This worked really well . 	0
WD	7530	On top of all this , we also paid taxes to the public school . 	0
WD	7531	I think it is really destructive when inclusion fails . 	0
WD	7532	It is better to build up to inclusion gradually where possible . 	0
WD	7533	I can see disallowing vocal prayer . 	1
WD	7534	A school is a public institution . 	0
WD	7535	It might offend some people . 	0
WD	7536	Inconsiderate bigots . 	0
WD	7537	What about the other children who believe in a different religion or have no religion ? 	0
WD	7538	But , of course . 	0
WD	7539	These types of Christians only care about themselves and THEIR beliefs . 	0
WD	7540	To hell with everyone else . 	0
WD	7541	The schools and government seem to think that my children belong to them . 	0
WD	7542	When I went to the schools about my children I was treated like an interloper and talked down to as if I was beneath them . 	0
WD	7543	As with any generalization , there are exceptions to the rule , but this is what I have seen . 	0
WD	7544	First , students with learning disabilities tend to be self conscious of the fact that they have a learning disability . 	0
WD	7545	There are , however , special education students with more severe disabilities who do stay in a different classroom , but those students are few and far between . 	0
WD	7546	Nowadays , special education students are in regular education classes along with everyone else . 	0
WD	7547	Things have changed tremendously since then . 	0
WD	7548	When I was in high school , special education students had their own wing in the school and mostly stayed there for all of their classes . 	0
WD	7549	Here is my experience . 	0
WD	7550	There can be , however , a few road blocks for special education students , parents and teachers . 	0
WD	7551	I have had several of them in my math classes , and they have generally been some of the best students . 	0
WD	7552	I think mainstreaming special education students is wonderful . 	1
WD	7553	For Zach homeschooling meant greater stability . 	0
WD	7554	He seem surprised that I was even going to the University and not the local Junior College to learn a trade and gave me no advise how to achieve it . 	0
WD	7555	In the University , I found out what they didn ' t teach me in high school and I was behind much of the first year . 	0
WD	7556	The idea is that a child needs extra time to catch up , whether physically , academically or emotionally . 	0
WD	7557	He would be one of the youngest kindergarteners–and because of this , I also have the option to hold him back ( or redshirt him ) . 	0
WD	7558	this was 1970 . 	0
WD	7559	Nobody seemed to care what we did . 	0
WD	7560	This is nuts . 	0
WD	7561	I went to a crappy high school . 	0

WD	7565	It ’ s snowing as I write this . 	0
WD	7566	My son Ryan turns 5 in May and , under our school district ’ s cutoff dates , he is eligible to start elementary school this fall . 	0
WD	7567	Like many parents of children with late-spring and summer birthdays , I must decide RIGHT NOW whether my child should begin kindergarten next year or repeat preschool . 	0
WD	7568	In most parts of the country , it ’ s time to register your 4- and 5-year-olds for kindergarten . 	0
WD	7569	But no matter . 	0
WD	7570	After this period , the brain becomes slowly less plastic and by the time the child reaches adolescence , the brain cannot develop " richly and normally any real cognitive system , including language . " http://www.cal.org/earlylang/benefits/research_notes.html As Larry The Cable Guy would say : " Only in America ! " 	0
WD	7571	These kids need to be prepared for the 21st centuary global economy by being enrolled in a local second language immersion kindergarden as soon as they can enroll . 	0
WD	7572	This is because language acquisition therories tell us that , " there is a window of opportunity in which the child learns that first language normally . 	0
WD	7573	Redshirting a trend ? 	0

WD	7578	Jesus ’ teaching on oath-taking recorded in Matthew 5 : 33-37 , while often misinterpreted , is actually a strong affirmation of the third commandment and a clear warning that “ the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain ” ( Exodus 20 : 7 ) . 	0
WD	7579	Not in Public Schools . 	0
WD	7580	Each and every family has the right to evaluate their child or children and their needs . 	0
WD	7581	I know that there are some very competent and dedicated private school teachers , but in general , how could they outperform public school teachers , who make so much more money ? 	0
WD	7582	Each choice , regardless of your opinion on homeschool or public school , should be respected . 	0
WD	7583	No one knows their child like them and the entire debate of homeschool versus public school is moot , except between mom and dad . 	0
WD	7584	That angle is in choosing what it best for my child this year . 	1
WD	7585	One thing is for sure . 	0
WD	7586	Next year it may be public school . 	1
WD	7587	What are the factors you considered when making this decision for your child ? 	0
WD	7588	I plan to see how that age assortment goes for him as it may mirror what we will encounter in kindergarten . 	0
WD	7589	This coming year of preschool instead of being in a traditional 3 ′ s classroom , he will be in a young 4 ′ s room that ranges from 3 1 / 2 to 4 1 / 2 . 	0
WD	7590	Taken together , the risk of Leo becoming bored outweighs any concerns I have about him socially . 	0
WD	7591	In some ways being surrounded by older kids is much easier because they tend to be more prosocial and they model social skills from which Leo can benefit . 	0
WD	7592	But , at this point he keeps up well with friends who are a year or more older , and prefers their company to kids who are a few months younger . 	0
WD	7593	Socially , I do wonder if being older would be helpful for him , especially since in adolescence it is socially advantageous for boys to hit puberty early ( it is risk factor for girls ) because that means physical strength . 	0
WD	7594	After his first day of preschool he was disappointed because “ I didn ’ t learn anything . ” 	0
WD	7595	I think he is a kid who is in danger of getting bored in a less stimulating / demanding environment . 	0
WD	7596	I know nothing about poetry , very little about art , and please don ’ t quiz me on the dates of the Civil War . 	0

WD	7604	Of course , we all know that bad parents exist . 	0
WD	7605	But typically , the state tends to make the worst parent of all , and I don ' t need its kinds of lessons . 	0
WD	7606	Only a fortnight ago a report was published by Robin Alexander and his team at Cambridge University which found that the primary school curriculum is too narrow and involves too much testing . 	0
WD	7607	Rather than taking on the challenge of addressing existing problems in a failing system run by overworked and pressured staff , Ed Balls is making a scapegoat of those who have chosen to work outside of that system , and blame them for noticing the government ' s educational failings . 	0
WD	7608	The reason for this is that kids and teens are getting their “ socialization education ” from other adults and their peers , without the guidance of their parents . 	0
WD	7609	Lastly , it is important to mention that these same negative values in public school are what is causing the increase in delinquent behavior , including drug abuse , sexual promiscuity , violence , emotional and psychological disorders , just to name a few . 	0

WD	7612	*** The real solution to improve the education system is , give every family with kids a voucher . 	0
WD	7613	The voucher can be surrendered at both private and public school . 	0
WD	7614	For that under privileged family it ' s a blessing , but for my family it was sad . 	0
WD	7615	The solution should have been fix the shxt school rather then wreck the good one . 	0
WD	7616	Some teachers get tenured and then stop trying to educate since they are now " retirement safe " this prevents a lot of the new graduates from obtaining a teaching carrier and replacing the dead wood . 	0
WD	7617	Each mother shared their respective observations of their kids , explaining how they came to their decision , when one mother interrupted , turned to me , pointed , and said , “ I want to know what you would do . 	0

WD	7620	But Khyra was known to be at risk by the agencies whose job it was to protect her both before and after her withdrawal from school . 	0
WD	7621	The topic quickly changed to kindergarten entrance , which was charged with palatable anxiety over whether their child should start this coming year or wait a year . 	0
WD	7622	Prayer is something that needs to be and should be taught in the home , by parents . 	0
WD	7623	Two years ago I was at a cocktail party and making friendly conversation with a group of women . 	0
WD	7624	This is one hot topic . 	0
WD	7625	Thankfully our child had to contend only with changing neighborhoods and not schools too . 	0
WD	7626	Since we were homeschooling our only child , we were able to give greater support to him during this time of upheaval and change . ” 	0

WD	7634	When they do , they never know if they will ever see their child alive again , or have their child ' s innocence stolen from them , or have their child ' s future altered and scared forever . 	0
WD	7635	Most Parents want to send their kids to private schools . 	0
WD	7636	We exchanged basic information about each other , you know , where we live , how many kids we have , what we do for a living . 	0

WD	7638	The school systems cannot afford to suspend or expel children . 	0
WD	7639	Emotional Security Bullying , peer pressure , teasing , competitive feelings are real issues that can mar the experience of a regular school for a child . 	0
WD	7640	Particularly for parents of only children , these issues often take nightmarish proportions ( and probably rightly so ) considering the deep care and protectiveness they offer their child . 	0
WD	7641	The principle seems straightforward – through registration , all home-educated children would become visible to the authorities , who could then protect them – and ensure that the education being received is adequate . 	0
WD	7642	If you want children to pray at school , there are plenty of Catholic and other private schools available . 	0
WD	7643	This is because they want the children to know , there is a price for acting up . 	0
WD	7644	I have seen in the public system , where a principal would give candy to the children that act up , to not do it again . 	0
WD	7645	It ' s ironic to me that the folks most likely to kvetch about all those worthless teachers and teachers unions are the ones who will then turn around and demand those teachers should be able to lead their students in prayer . 	0
WD	7646	Let me say , as a parent and as a Christian , I don ' t want my daughter ' s teacher or her principal or her classmates leading her in prayer in school — including what someone else might consider " good Christian prayer " or else some watered-down pablum generic invocation . 	1

WD	7655	In a matter of moments , five students were gunned down . 	0

WD	7657	Parent-Teacher conferences were set for Thursday . 	0

WD	7664	Gunfire . 	0
WD	7665	There is a time and a place for everything , including religion . 	0
WD	7666	I am not sure if this is already the case , but I believe that it would serve the State well to treat homeschooling as a type of private school and require that they meet the same standards as those registered facilities . 	0
WD	7667	I am involved as a parent , why is it that we have religion in Jails but not in the public school system . 	0
WD	7668	There ' s no doubt boys behave a little different when girls are watching , and i also found boys were quite good at limiting the bitchyness girls are renowned for . 	0
WD	7669	Some parents may see this as an invasion of their privacy and an intrusion , but the State has a responsibility to ensure that all children living in this country are properly educated . 	0
WD	7670	So both kept one another in line , and made for a more positive and dynamic environment . 	0
WD	7671	I also think there ' s a few extra life lessons and skills children can learn at co ed schools . 	0
WD	7672	Public schools have kicked prayer and Christ out and now their working on the pledge of allegiance . 	0
WD	7673	Really I ' m bad because I want my daughter to know Christ . 	0
WD	7674	Dating , relationships , interacting with the opposite sex , i think children at co ed schools tend to have a far better grasp of these skills then students who ' ve only attended same sex schools . 	0
WD	7675	So what makes your average mom or dad think they can do my job with no degree and no experience ? 	0
WD	7676	The unpleasant fact is that parents who want to abuse children have ample opportunity wherever their children ' s education is taking place . 	0
WD	7677	Public School is not the place for religion , unless we are doing a Comparative Religions course , in which all views are examined . 	1
WD	7678	Parents today can shell out some cash and skip the " Reform Period " by going private . 	0
WD	7679	I was a product of the public school system , and yes , they are very necessary . 	0
WD	7680	Secondly , banning school prayer can in no way be seen as somehow rejecting or abandoning the alleged divine protection that schools would otherwise enjoy , as such theological criticisms always seem to intend to imply . 	0
WD	7681	That in itself clearly does not transform schools into “ God-free zones ” ; banning schools from leading prayers , like banning schools from teaching religious doctrines such as creationism or posting religious rules such as the Ten Commandments , merely ensures that public schools remain religiously neutral environments , for students of every religion or no religion . 	0
WD	7682	For proof of this , all one need do is to recall the 2006 shooting spree which occurred in an Amish school in Pennsylvania . 	0
WD	7683	Officially implementing mandatory school prayers in no way offers a divine guarantee against school shootings from occurring . 	0
WD	7684	And this tragedy occurred despite the fact that community-based Amish schools ( which are not public schools ) conduct morning Bible readings and daily prayers . 	0
WD	7685	Or you could stop being so selfish to the child and send it out into the world so it can learn the importance of society and how to ineract with it . . . an education is often only useful if you know how to work with people using it . 	0
WD	7686	I ' m sure you are , but there are plenty that aren ' t . 	0
WD	7687	what like making sure you are fit to teach a child responsibly . . 	0
WD	7688	The girls in my year just had entirely different interests . 	0
WD	7689	In terms of results ; I really think it ' s mostly up to the individual and how driven they are , coupled together with a good teacher , as to whether or not they do well . 	0
WD	7690	Most of the people I have spoken to who have attended an all-girls school would have chosen to go co-ed had they been given another chance . 	0
WD	7691	I myself went to a co-ed , and am so glad I was able to – I only had a few close female friends , because I was way more comfortable hanging out with the boys – I just preferred playing sport during breaks than gossiping about what happened over the weekend . 	0
WD	7692	But there is also a case to be made for parents who wish to home-school their children . 	1
WD	7693	We in Barbados think of homeschooling as an activity that occurs only in North American countries or perhaps further afield , and cannot imagine why in a country that offers free education to all school aged children , a parent would want to take on the responsibility of teaching their child . 	0
WD	7694	The curriculum is much more hands on and students learn more . 	0
WD	7695	I am all for the public school system . 	1
WD	7696	It is a question I used to ask myself some years ago , until I recognised that the school environment of today is much more explosive than it was just a few decades ago . 	0
WD	7697	I would respectfully recommend you actually take the time to learn about home-schooling before posting such ignorant and hateful words but alas , the products of a liberal and intolerant educational system cannot possibly fathom such a possibility . 	0
WD	7698	Ah yes , the shining examples of the ignorance of home-schooling is well displayed in the majority of these posts . 	0
WD	7699	A second reason I deplore single sex schools is that girls and women are shortchanged as far as math and science are concerned . 	0
WD	7700	This is a skill that is not learned in a single sex environment . 	0
WD	7701	In order to get along in adult society most occupations require that their practitioners get along with both men and women . 	0
WD	7702	They learn to regard members of the opposite sex as people . 	0
WD	7703	In a coed school children deal with each other as individuals . 	0
WD	7704	It will no doubt require that officials of the Ministry of Education create measures to guide parents opting to go this route , and by extension require them to visit these homes to observe what is being done . 	0
WD	7705	One thing that I hope all people learn in school is to get along with other people . 	0
WD	7706	I regard single sex education as bad . 	1
WD	7707	“ It ’ s the isolation that allows it to exist . " 	0
WD	7708	One friend of mine , a product of a girl ' s high school , had to take remedial courses so that she could satisfactorily take college level science course . 	0
WD	7709	My observations of women who were products of girls schools is that they do not have the same preparation that women who are products of coed schools do . 	0
WD	7710	So if we add Friday to the weekend , then Muslims can go to the mosque on Friday , and not have to choose between going to school , or going to worship . 	0
WD	7711	It ’ s simple ! 	0
WD	7712	Now , there are pros and cons for each . 	0
WD	7713	But I feel that the co-ed school is more " natural " and its pros outweigh its cons more than the all-girls school . 	0
WD	7714	Otherwise , any discussion of religion should be strictly technical . 	0
WD	7715	I switched to an all-girls school in the 10th grade and stayed until I finished high school . 	0
WD	7716	First of all , those of us who send our children to private schools are also paying for the public schools at the same time through our property taxes . 	0
WD	7717	I can not tell you how many times I have come across teachers with over inflated egos . 	0
WD	7718	Schools are not always bad because of funding etc . Sometimes they are un areas that are mismanaged or just have bad teachers . 	0
WD	7719	Good schools draw good students regardless of a private or public classification . 	0
WD	7720	They think they are a parent and saving the world of their students , when really they are incapable of passing on any amount of knowledge . 	0
WD	7721	But there ' s always going to be a difference of maturity between different individuals , whether male or female . 	0
WD	7722	My father continues to deny my condition to this day and like many disabled children in mainstream schools I was bullied . 	0
WD	7723	Girls are more mature than boys generally , yes . 	0
WD	7724	And personally , I was always more mature than most of the other girls , too . 	0
WD	7725	Since you can no longer pray at school or discuss God , I choose to raise my child with my beliefs and send her to a private school . 	1
WD	7726	Ask your daughters what they would prefer . . . Btw , I work at a co-ed school at the moment and the kids there get on just fine . 	0
WD	7727	Her year went really well too . 	0
WD	7728	And on and on . 	0
WD	7729	Girls do calming exercises ; boys run . 	0
WD	7730	It has a way of sharpening the mind . 	0
WD	7731	That ’ s likely to be good for all of us , regardless of gender . 	0
WD	7732	Hearing yourself say some of this gobbledygook aloud to your kids , though ? 	0
WD	7733	It is closer to the ' real world ' that way . 	0
WD	7734	I went to an all boys school – Can ' t say I particularly liked it , I would of much preferred gone to a co-ed . 	1
WD	7735	They will be more at ease around the opposite sex when they are older and it just makes sense . 	0
WD	7736	Kids should grow up in the company of both sexes . . . 	0
WD	7737	We were the worst in 12 years and were beaten by LOTS of co-ed and public schools . . . 	0
WD	7738	If it is purely education you are concerned about ( and not so much behaviour ) , our year ( at a private school ) went shockingly bad in OP scores . 	0
WD	7739	In saying that my sister really enjoyed going to an all girls school . 	0
WD	7740	So you can never tell . 	0
WD	7741	We are making this sacrifice for him because this is what is best for him . 	0
WD	7742	I would make the same sacrifice for my daughter but she is doing just fine where she is now . 	0
WD	7743	We are making it work and I can tell you , that I have seen a 100% difference in him . 	0
WD	7744	He is relaxed and eager to do well and so excited that his largest class has 14 kids . 	0
WD	7745	At the end of the day this is a very personal choice that each family has to make for their child individually . 	0
WD	7746	Some view much of what as taught as " secularism . " 	0
WD	7747	But none of this is praying to Darwin , or claiming him , or anything , a deity . 	0
WD	7748	This is a sticky subject . 	0
WD	7749	Some think of evolution as teaching atheism . 	0
WD	7750	If they wish to raise their children as atheists , that is their right no matter what anyone thinks . 	0
WD	7751	So therefore they must put up with the school forcing a faith , no matter how shallow , on them ? 	0
WD	7752	Please look forif you ' re interested . 	0
WD	7753	A good question here is how much does this cut into a parent ' s right to raise their children . 	0
WD	7754	Wow . 	0
WD	7755	This brings up a related topic about children ' s rights . 	0
WD	7756	There are serious problems in our public schools . 	0
WD	7757	Morals can only be built on the basis that a moral source-God-exists . 	0
WD	7758	Once acknowledgement of God ' s existence is removed , there is no absolute basis for morals , and a free society drifts toward anarchy . 	0
WD	7759	Young Mr . Powell is another tragic example of the fallacy of Home Schooling . 	0
WD	7760	Then its badness is just something you deplore in the abstract . 	0
WD	7761	Since prayer was removed from public school classrooms in 1962 , we have had a six-fold increase in violent crime , our divorce rate has tripled , births to single mothers have increased five-fold , the teenage suicide rate has tripled , and SAT scores ( standardized college entrance test ) have dropped 80 points ( approximately 10% ) . 	0
WD	7762	No matter how well intentioned , few parents have the education , time , and skills needed to teach . 	0
WD	7763	Parents have all the years before the kids start school in which to indoctrinate litt 	0
WD	7764	When your public school system ranks #50 in the nation you tell me , would you rather send your child to public school or honor them with attending a private school ? 	0
WD	7765	Those who find the schools beneath their ideal learning experience should join everyone in an effort to renew our schools , demanding better performance and . 	0
WD	7766	outcome and be willing to support the much needed funding . 	0
WD	7767	Independent schools have much greater freedom to follow other educational philosophies and practices - Montessori , Steiner , small alternative schools and Summerhill being particularly noteworthy . 	0
WD	7768	But the belief that the schools and teachers must meet their Christian education agenda ends any discussion . 	0
WD	7769	I feel my education was a perfect balance . 	0
WD	7770	The whole issue is just another example of a populace that has fallen into a big ditch , dug by those who despise authority ( Nobody tells me what to do ) , see plots and loss of freedom in every shadow , behind every bush , and in anything that will require them to think before they vote . 	0
WD	7771	Befuddled wishful thinking rules . 	0
WD	7772	Imo it ' s not healthy for anyone . 	0
WD	7773	Maybe that makes me awful but I cannot and will not be everything to them 24 / 7 . 	0
WD	7774	I simply don ' t have the desire or patience to be THAT present . 	0
WD	7775	I would shell out the money for private school before I homeschool . 	1
WD	7776	As Britain becomes more secular , it becomes increasingly ridiculous that outdated laws like that of collective worship stay on the books . 	0
WD	7777	They have lots of great adults in their lives . 	0
WD	7778	I am homeschooling and I am not under any illusion that I am " everything " for my kids 24 / 7 . 	0
WD	7779	It ' s important to remember too that private schools are neither required to hire certified teachers nor administer state tests . 	0
WD	7780	They also have wide latitude in deciding which students to admit and which to push out . 	0
WD	7781	The national average of public schools is pulled down by the number of such schools serving poor students . 	0
WD	7782	If these schools were eliminated , schools in the affluent suburbs would hold their own against the best private schools . 	0
WD	7783	But achievement is higher because students in private schools come from more affluent families than students in public schools , rather than because of better practices . 	0
WD	7784	This distinction is crucial . 	0
WD	7785	Using data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study , Sarah and Christopher Lubienski , professors at the University of Illinois , found that when controlling for demographic factors , public schools are doing a better job academically than private schools . 	0
WD	7786	The parents can talk to their kids about evolution and explain that they do not believe that evolution ever happened ; they can try to push the creation theory and see where they end up . 	0
WD	7787	At a time when public schools are the target of unrelenting criticism , the results of a new study come as welcome news ( " Are Private Schools Worth It ? " 	0
WD	7788	The Atlantic , Oct . 18 ) . 	0
WD	7789	But don ' t assume that one size fits everybody , because it doesn ' t . 	1
WD	7790	If you really enjoyed school , good for you . 	0
WD	7791	Each to his own , as I said . 	0
WD	7792	I learned nothing that I did not know before other than a handful of French verbs which have so far been of as much use as a chocolate fireguard . 	0
WD	7793	I feel strongly that I had a very good education , but my husband said his was lacking . 	0
WD	7794	Neither of us knows much about private education from personal experience , however both of us have met privately-schooled people at university and through work . 	0
WD	7795	These people have spoken about opportunities , like sport and music programs , that had not been available to us as public students , and the extra resources available at the private schools because there was more money available . 	0
WD	7796	The media is full of reports on the lack of funding for public education , and the number of teachers compared with students in the public system means classes are bigger than we ’ d like . 	0
WD	7797	But for a complete , general education do private schools offer the range of subjects , experiences and environment public schools do ? 	0
WD	7798	From my school experience , public schools offered more diversity socially , spiritually and ethnically , so I think it provided a more realistic view of the world I would face after school . 	0
WD	7799	If officials at your school have questions about the event , share our letter with them . 	0
WD	7800	To help these students , we have prepared a letter explaining students ’ well-established legal right to engage in prayer and worship at See You at the Pole and to promote the event at school . 	0
WD	7801	An impotent prayer is no threat to anyone . 	0
WD	7802	If you honestly think your kids will be permanently damaged by learning about evolution , get a grip . 	0
WD	7803	But an effective prayer to a God who hears … well , I guess some might find that a little threatening . " 	0
WD	7804	I am not one who needs others to make the choices I made to feel better about myself . 	0
WD	7805	And it ’ s not even the superior academics . 	0
WD	7806	Full disclosure : my wife and I homeschooled our four children through eighth grade , and then used a mixture of private Christian high school and additional homeschooling throughout their high school years . 	0
WD	7807	But that ’ s not what drives this for me . 	0
WD	7808	And want one more fact that may surprise you ? 	0
WD	7809	Homeschooled children do not lag behind public school children overall in communication and socialization skills . 	0
WD	7810	Homeschooled children ’ s tests scores were not significantly affected by their parents ’ household incomes or whether their parents were certified teachers . 	0
WD	7811	Homeschooled children perform better overall in college — from their freshman years to their senior years . 	0
WD	7812	So why am I such an advocate ? 	0
WD	7813	Because homeschooling is what lets you guard and protect your child ’ s heart and optimally mold their character in a dark and fallen world . 	0
WD	7814	Trust me , I know . 	0
WD	7815	First hand . 	0
WD	7816	Learn what ? 	0
WD	7817	The BS they half-arsedly try to teach us ? 	0
WD	7818	Isherwood Yes , that ' s true , but the purpose is to give students time to collect thoughts , pray , do homework for the class at hand , etc . Sorry , I can ' t quote the source , but I read some statistics the other day that students who make time each day for some silence ( not necessarily religiously related silence and / or prayer , just silence ) do much better in school because people don ' t realize how much noise dominates our days and inhibits our thought . 	0
WD	7819	I don ' t think 2 minutes of silence could possibly hinder our absolutely terrible public education any further than it ' s current decrepit state . 	0
WD	7820	It ' s all good . 	0
WD	7821	Don ' t worry , I agree . 	0
WD	7822	They are still usually better than parents who have other things to do and who ignore the daily chore of teaching their kids schoolwork . 	0
WD	7823	I attended private school up until age 14 , and I have yet to learn anything from our public ed . system . 	0
WD	7824	True , but the scenario at the top was obviously over-the-top wrong . 	0
WD	7825	His father , Clarence Powell , defends the home-school education that Josh and his 11 siblings have received , and that he has a right to educate his children any way he sees fit without the government interfering . 	0
WD	7826	He eventually took remedial classes at a community college and has since transferred to Georgetown University , but he still has a long way to go in catching up on the years of missed education . 	0
WD	7827	When they declined , he petitioned the school system to let him in , but they declined too . 	0
WD	7828	Powell himself realized how far behind he was falling and had asked his parents to send him to school . 	0
WD	7829	One of his siblings , currently at middle school age , still hasn ' t learned to read . 	0
WD	7830	Powell tells of how his parents , who kept him and his 11 younger siblings out of public schools for religious reasons , failed to provide a basic education that left him far behind other children his age in areas like math , science , history , and English . 	0
WD	7831	The article profiles 21-year-old Josh Powell , the product of home schooling in rural Virginia , who paints an incredibly negative picture of the experience of getting your education at home . 	0
WD	7832	Why do some parents not think their kids can attain ? 	0
WD	7833	No student should be *ASSIGNED* to a single-sex school against his / her will , but I ' m all in favor of voluntary selection into one . 	0
WD	7834	I would much prefer my children attend single-sex high schools to cut down on the distraction factor . 	1
WD	7835	The Powells , of course , are just on case of a home-schooling family , but Josh thinks they are other kids like him . 	0
WD	7836	The example one of them gave was , " My neighbor held back her child , and now she ' s in first grade , and reading at a 4th grade level ! " 	0
WD	7837	Not only that , but far from the crisis in public education that many see , the Lubienskis make a strong case that public school are doing a fine job educating the youth of America . 	0
WD	7838	The results of the study don ’ t surprise me because I live in the real world , and in the real world the best get paid the most . 	0
WD	7839	According to Atlantic , the Lubienskis report that the Educational Testing Service , Stanford and Notre Dame all took a look at the same statistics — datasets they call it — and came to the same conclusions . 	0
WD	7840	The Lubienskis aren ’ t saying that public school students score higher , because test comparisons show that the average private school student scores higher . 	0
WD	7841	But the private school student is likely to be wealthier , come from a stable family , not have a disability and not have suffered early life trauma . 	0
WD	7842	Correct for these factors — in a sense only compare apples that fell from the private school tree with those that fell from the public school tree — and the public school wins hands down . 	0
WD	7843	It doesn ’ t surprise me that somebody figured out how to prove that public schools outperform private schools . 	1
WD	7844	And it doesn ’ t surprise me that this seminal study is being ignored by the mainstream news media . 	0
WD	7845	As of one day after Atlantic released its article reviewing The Public School Advantage : Why Public Schools Outperform Private Schools , a Google search yielded but one article covering the important findings of authors Sarah Theule Lubienski and Christopher A Lubienski . 	0
WD	7846	The Lubienskis took into the account the effects of affluence , disabilities and other background factors and found that then public schools outperformed private schools over the past twenty years . 	0
WD	7847	I don ' t think age really dictates how well you will do in school or in sports . 	0
WD	7848	The only reason most private schools show good numbers is because they can completely ignore all the problem students . 	0
WD	7849	Around here , there are plenty of choices , but the government only pays for public education of various types and those who can afford private schools pay for those above and beyond their property taxes that fund the public schools . 	0
WD	7850	I don ' t see the big deal . 	1
WD	7851	I do what is best for my children and assume other parents do what is best for their children . 	0
WD	7852	Interestingly , it wasn ' t the atheist Madalyn Murray O ' Hair who sued the school district to stop this , it was some Jewish parents , who thought that the prayers said in school would not be considered appropriate for Jewish students to pray . 	0
WD	7853	Let us hope they do not break the broad global consensus on education reform by pursuing ideological distractions that threaten to undermine the right to education . 	0
WD	7854	For many years the DFID has been a global leader in supporting sector-wide public education reform through the Global Partnership for Education . 	0
WD	7855	Lost revenues from tax exemptions given away unnecessarily by governments add up to $138 billion annually- which is more than enough to ensure we deliver on the full education and wider development agenda in every country . 	0
WD	7856	We need to support progressive macro-economic policies over austerity and we urgently need to expand the domestic tax base of low income countries , for example by ending the unnecessary and often corrupt tax holidays given to big multinational companies . 	0
WD	7857	We need to mobilise new resourcing for education , securing at least 6% of GDP and 20% of national budgets . 	0
WD	7858	We desperately need to improve the quality of public schools , and this issue needs concerted attention and support . 	0
WD	7859	Thankfully , most DFID funding for education is still spent on such efforts . 	0
WD	7860	Such investments yield systemic , nation-wide returns in improving quality – a much more strategic and effective use of public money . 	0
WD	7861	Ideological reasons for homeschooling are , in my opinion , completely legitimate . 	0
WD	7862	The public education system has not failed , it ' s got to deal with things that no private school does . 	0
WD	7863	Most private schools are nothing more than religious indoctrination , what difference does it make ? 	0
WD	7864	If you put the same restrictions on the private schools , they ' d be just as bad . 	0
WD	7865	America has experienced radical decline in each of the four areas which the children ’ s prayer touched upon : youth , family , education , national life . 	0
WD	7866	The New York school children which prompted the Engel vs . Vitale ruling had simply prayed : “ Almighty God , we acknowledge our dependence on Thee and beg Thy blessing over us , our parents , our teachers and our nation . ” 	0
WD	7867	The removal of prayer from our schools was a violation of the third commandment which commands us “ not to take the name of the Lord in vain . ” 	0
WD	7868	Minor recovery has occurred only since 1980 when the election of President Reagan brought forth a renewed emphasis on “ traditional ” values . 	0
WD	7869	Consider the following chart compiled from his study , America : To Pray or Not to Pray . 	0
WD	7870	A recent statistical analysis by David Barton graphically illustrates how America has plummeted from righteous living , prosperity and success in the last quarter century . 	0
WD	7871	On June 25 , l962 , 39 million students were forbidden to do what they and their predecessors had been doing since the founding of our nation – publicly calling upon the name of the Lord at the beginning of each school day . 	0
WD	7872	1 As you might have already noticed on Mr . Barton ’ s graph , America ’ s moral decline rapidly accelerated following one event – the U . S . Supreme Court ’ s removal of prayer from our nation ’ s schools . 	0
WD	7873	Worse than taking the Lord ’ s sacred name in vain is treating it with contempt , denying it rightful place and stripping it from public use and even from the lips of children . 	0
WD	7874	By the judicial act of forbidding invocation , the Court audaciously elevated a secularized system of education beyond the authority , reach and blessing of God Himself . 	0
WD	7875	Each school district is different . 	0
WD	7876	Each classroom environment is different . 	0
WD	7877	Each child is an individual . 	0
WD	7878	I continue to monetarily support a broken system that I can not even take advantage the so called benefits of because it does not give my child the adequate tools she will need to be successful in life . 	0
WD	7879	That February birthday excuses me from much of this anxiety . 	0
WD	7880	I think the social aspect of co-education outweighs the potential distractions ; at the end of 6 years , you come out with a study score , but once you have that , I think the memories and friendships you got out of those 6 years become much more important , and I can ' t imagine having as good an experience had I gone to an all-girls school . 	0
WD	7881	While a public school classroom is perfect for your 11-year old Johnnie , it might not be right for 9-year old Susie . 	0
WD	7882	While a particular school district worked well for your kids , perhaps moving to a new school district found them to not be so cooperative . 	0
WD	7883	Given the research on the topic , if you have concerns about your child ’ s behavior and that is why you are considering delaying them , this is important information that may signal your child would benefit from behavioral intervention , if not immediately than it is something to keep in mind as they progress through their early years of schooling . 	0
WD	7884	So what is the answer to the question originally asked of me at that cocktail party ? 	0
WD	7885	What will I do for Leo ? 	0
WD	7886	Well , he will be 5 1 / 2 at the time of kindergarten . 	0
WD	7887	Although I am a big fan of examining the data to inform parenting , the results often do not reveal a clear path , and although group level statistics are useful , they do not tell parents what their individual child ’ s trajectory will be . 	0
WD	7888	What is clear , however , is that given redshirting is much less common than originally thought , parents should worry less about how their child ’ s age will compare to peers ( there is no reason to hold them back just so they won ’ t be much younger than most of their peers ) and more about the signals their own children are giving them . 	0
WD	7889	The big areas to consider are : social skills ( ability to initiate and maintain play , sharing , understanding of own and others ’ emotions ) , academic skills ( knowledge of content areas such as letter / number recognition and phonics ) , ability to regulate impulses ( staying on task , following directions ) , and fine motor skills ( fine motor skills have been linked with academic success above and beyond content knowledge and attentional abilities ) . 	0
WD	7890	Interestingly , teachers rate enthusiasm to learn , ability to follow directions , and attention span as the most important factors for kindergarten success , less so than actual academic knowledge ( which parents tend to perceive as most important ) . 	0
WD	7891	Send your kids to school with their kids . 	0
WD	7892	Do something about it . 	0
WD	7893	Use your connections to power and money and innovation to make your local school—the one you are now sending your child to—better . 	0
WD	7894	Use the energy you have otherwise directed at fighting to get your daughter a slot at the competitive private school to fight for more computers at the public school . 	0
WD	7895	Don ’ t just acknowledge your liberal guilt—listen to it . 	0
WD	7896	Single sex education has been very good for girls , especially . 	1
WD	7897	Look at the women leaders in this country and you will find that they are products of single sex educational institutions . 	0
WD	7898	That would still be a step beyond even what those who complain about secularism are complaining to God . 	0
WD	7899	It is opposed because it represents the antithesis to the beliefs of those who set policy for much of our public school system . 	0
WD	7900	My kids won ' t go to public schools for a lot of reasons . 	0
WD	7901	I in good conscience could not ask anyone else to through good money after bad as you suggest that we all do . 	0
WD	7902	Values can be promoted , in accordance with the client population ' s choice . 	0
WD	7903	Private schools provide an option for respecting religion and expressing it publicly . 	0
WD	7904	Ms Wong is really the bad person here , because she wishes to impose a secularist establishment which cannot bring itself to keeping boys in the boys ' lavatories or allowing even elective religiously supported ethical education to be presented to students . 	0
WD	7905	We are so integrated in our neighborhoods and businesses that there is no chance that divisiveness might be exacerbated by private schools , especially in the contemporary religious environment . 	0
WD	7906	That secularism was the worst feature of Soviet Communism and we know what it led to . 	0
WD	7907	Prayer is an action which proclaims that life is more than saving the environment or accumulating wealth . 	0
WD	7908	If the textbooks contain any reference to God , there ' s trouble , and if the teachers happen to make any kind of a reference to God , or religion . . or the hereafter . . or what ever may have any religious connotation , the children tell their parents and the parents complain ! ! ! ! 	0
WD	7909	Time was , the school day started with a prayer , and yes , maybe religion classes , but not nowadays . . there would be full scale war . 	0
WD	7910	The movement to single-sex education in the US has been framed as a solution to both girls ’ absence from science , technology , engineering , and math disciplines and the perceived decline in boys ’ overall academic success . 	0
WD	7911	However , the data behind these assertions is shaky at best . 	0
WD	7912	Diane Halpern , Professor of Psychology at Claremont McKenna College and former President of the American Psychological Association , wrote a particularly biting review of the pro single-sex education literature . 	0
WD	7913	Perhaps as a result of the pro single-sex education framing , the US has seen an increased interest in single-sex schooling in the last few decades . 	0
WD	7914	More private single-sex schools have emerged and even many public school districts have begun to experiment with single-sex programs or classrooms . 	0
WD	7915	An important question that arises in consideration of public schooling , though , is if separate schooling is actually fair to all students . 	0
WD	7916	Where ever the Muslims go , they expect " special " treatment . 	0
WD	7917	Ohhhh , here we go again ! ! ! ! 	0
WD	7918	In order to keep everyone satisfied , there should be no religion in schools . 	1
WD	7919	No religion in schools . . . . this is what we ' ve come to . 	1
WD	7920	Too bad , if the Muslim children don ' t come back to classes after their prayers . 	0
WD	7921	If parents want their children to have religion , they are going to have to teach them at home or in their places of worship . 	0
WD	7922	For goodness sake , it ' s just awful . 	0
WD	7923	That ' s their problem , not the school ' s . 	0
WD	7924	To this day , I tend to feel uncomfortable around anyone who doesn ' t fit that criteria ( ironically enough , since I ' m a left-winged , pansexual atheist ) . 	0
WD	7925	No one is being forced to participate in the event , nor is it interfering with class time . 	0
WD	7926	Yes , they socialize with other people - but those people are other white , right-winged , heterosexual Christians . 	0
WD	7927	So what is the threat ? 	0
WD	7928	They just don ' t get it . 	0
WD	7929	They just don ' t understand the world . 	0
WD	7930	And , that starts with a high quality , fair education that focuses on techniques that work and teaches all students as individuals , not as stereotypes . 	0
WD	7931	There were not a lot of choices as far as curriculum and very few parents continued to homeschool through high school . 	0
WD	7932	I don ' t think that home schooling is good for children and I don ' t think that single sex schooling is good for children either . 	1
WD	7933	On September 25th , millions of students across the globe will participate in See You at the Pole by joining together before the beginning of the school day to pray for their friends , families , teachers , school , and nations . 	0
WD	7934	Whatever home schooling does for you intellectually , I can ' t think it can have that great an influence on their ability to fit in with other kids . 	0
WD	7935	Prepared to be proved wrong though . . . . 	0
WD	7936	Interesting . 	0
WD	7937	I commend your commitment and I wish you all the best for your sons . 	0
WD	7938	I suspect you will probably do a better job of educating them than most schools would . 	0
WD	7939	I can ' t help wondering , though , what the fallout is likely to be in terms of their ability to socialise with other kids . 	0
WD	7940	What bothers me here is that this appears to have been a group decision . 	0
WD	7941	None of us are perfect . 	0
WD	7942	That said , should the decision have been made by one person I would understand and cut that person some slack . 	0
WD	7943	There are many intricate details when making decisions in regards to drawing the line when separation is required . 	0
WD	7944	But such reasoning is deeply flawed and fallacious on multiple levels . 	0
WD	7945	Firstly , we have not “ kicked God out of our schools . ” 	0
WD	7946	Students can ( and do ) . 	0
WD	7947	In the wake of violent school-related tragedies , such as the recent massacre at a Newtown , Connecticut public elementary school , there is often a wave of heated rhetoric emanating from religious conservatives regarding how perhaps such school shootings might not have occurred if only we had not “ kicked God out of our schools ” by banning state-led school prayer . 	0
WD	7948	So , schools are by no means “ prayer free zones ” — the shrill objections of ultra-conservative Christians committed to the unconstitutional re-introduction of state-sanctioned , teacher-led daily school prayer notwithstanding . 	0
WD	7949	Just because school officials may not lead students in prayers does not mean that students are unable to freely pray on their own , throughout the day , at school . 	0
WD	7950	While acting in their capacity as employees of the state , public school teachers must comply by the constitutional rules that prevent the state from endorsing or promoting religion . 	0
WD	7951	( That also means that public school teachers may not post the Ten Commandments in their classrooms , or teach creationism in science classes , since doing so amounts to just as much of an unconstitutional state endorsement or promotion of religion as does leading students in classroom prayers . ) 	0
WD	7952	That was a hard call because he was pretty shy until high school . 	0
WD	7953	These techniques can vary from room temperature to instruction approaches . 	0
WD	7954	Some educators also suggest that single-sex education can broaden the educational prospects for both the sexes . 	0
WD	7955	When putting these theories into practice , however , experts have asserted that separating students has consequences that extend far beyond the act of learning . 	0
WD	7956	Social , political , and legal concerns come into play when dealing with instituting these policies in public schools . 	0
WD	7957	Proponents of same-sex education argue that a mixed-gender classroom can be distracting for many students , especially at certain ages . 	0
WD	7958	Leonard Sax , founder of the National Association for Single-Sex Public Education , argues that while merely placing boys in separate classrooms from girls accomplishes little , single-sex education enhances student success when teachers use techniques geared toward the gender of their students . 	0
WD	7959	Single-sex education ( teaching males and females in separate classrooms or schools ) is an old approach to instruction that has been gaining new momentum in the education reform era . 	0
WD	7960	Although the practice has long existed in many private schools , it ' s a relatively new option for traditional public schools and charter schools . 	0
WD	7961	Now that over 500 public schools offer some form of single-sex education , experts are renewing the debate over the value of separating boys and girls in the classroom . 	0
WD	7962	According to recent research on the differences between males and females , there are natural differences in how boys and girls approach learning . 	0
WD	7963	I can learn things for myself w / little effort . 	0
WD	7964	But I cannot teach someone else on an educational level , especially since the techniques have changed so much from the way I learned . 	0
WD	7965	My boys have needed help w / their homework at times , and I am honestly dumbfounded at the processes that are used today . 	0
WD	7966	Aside from the fact that I just could not ensure they would get the proper education they deserve for themselves , the only other con that I can see w / homeschooling though is the socialization skills . 	0
WD	7967	I have to say that I admire anyone who has the patience for homeschooling . 	0
WD	7968	I know that I could never do it and make sure that my boys got a good enough education . 	0
WD	7969	Because I ' m a much better " learner " than I am a " teacher " and admittingly I just don ' t have the patience that it requires . 	0
WD	7970	I can teach life skills w / no problem . 	0
WD	7971	I know there are other ways around it , but to me , the best way for kids to learn how to interact w / their own peers is by having the opportunity to learn in an environment that isn ' t necessarily always something interest-based like sports , clubs , playgrounds , etc . but that ' s just me . 	0
WD	7972	I know exactly what is spent per student , the check I just wrote . 	0
WD	7973	They removed me from school because school / teachers were teaching me nothing other than ‘ you are thick so why bother teaching you ’ . 	0
WD	7974	My second son , whom graduated from MIT , received a “ Mathematics and Verbal Talent Search Award from The John Hopkins University in 1995 ; when we attended the ceremony we observed that most of the recipients of the awards were home-schooling students and had foreign last names . 	0
WD	7975	No everybody can teach and learn at home , and some parents and students cheat at home as well as they do at public schools , and the big problem is that nobody could catch them because the most important thing for many parents in this country is that their children should have as many “ As ” as possible on their resu 	0
WD	7976	From the students I taught that were home-schooling , only one was exceptional brilliant , he got a very high score in the SAT , and he attended the University of Maryland , College Park to study engineering . 	0
WD	7977	Also , I know that I could have home-schooling my children , because I have a very high level of education , but I would not have the patient to do that , and I believe my sons were benefited with a very good education from a very good public high school with excellent teachers in Worcester County in Maryland ; my oldest son is a biologist ( Salisbury University ) with three masters , my second son is a mathematician ( MIT ) , and my third son is a mechanical engineer ( College Park ) . 	0
WD	7978	It isn ’ t the same the influence that a student mind has from several teachers and their way of thinking than from only one parent way of teaching . 	0
WD	7979	My three sons graduated from a very good high school in Worcester County in Maryland , and the three of them attended excellent universities . 	0
WD	7980	( And non of the home schooling families I know did / do that either , so what a silly thing to assume that ' s why families do it ) . 	0
WD	7981	It blows my mind to see a public school student with a cell phone , but the parents can ' t afford a box of Cheerios and a ham sandwich . 	0
WD	7982	My parents knew I was capable of more , that I was intelligent but somehow school weren ’ t willing to see it . 	0
WD	7983	I wasn ’ t me that ‘ couldn ’ t be bothered to learn ’ it was the teachers who couldn ’ t be bothered to teach . 	0
WD	7984	Teachers in private school make a fraction of what teachers make in public schools . 	0
WD	7985	How is it that sending a child to a private school for religious reasons makes a parent , " bad people " ? 	0
WD	7986	Our liberal , anti-Christian government and the small minority of whining atheists have cleansed our public schools of any positive values and moral teaching . 	0
WD	7987	Revisionist historians have changed the textbooks to honor the immoral and eliminate reference to godly individuals and the good contributions that religion and churches have made to our society . 	0
WD	7988	They , instead , use our public schools to promote a liberal agenda and brainwash our children to follow those principles . 	0
WD	7989	And this author thinks we are " bad people " for shielding our children from this garbage and creating well-balanced , healthy minded adults who contribute greatly to help our communities ? 	0
WD	7990	The advantage of private school is simple , my money pays for my daughter to be surrounded by like-minded teachers and parents who all want the same thing for their children , a top notch education . 	0
WD	7991	The teachers and administrators are all held accountable and not beholden to a system that is more concerned with keeping people employed , per student spending and providing free breakfast and lunch . 	0
WD	7992	There are the rare exceptions where homeschooling is great - but for most it is child abuse . 	1
WD	7993	Regular testing should be required and if they fail it ' s back to public school . 	0
WD	7994	I have been known to crunch some granola myself and do not view this as a bad thing . 	0
WD	7995	Actually , after reading the comments , that is about the same percentage as my readers who choose to homeschool . 	0
WD	7996	While homeschooling is becoming more secular , the No . 1 reason ( 36% ) parents give for homeschooling is for religious reasons . 	0
WD	7997	However , one is in college and the other is going to be a junior in high school this fall , so that ship has sailed . 	0
WD	7998	Many parents commented that they can get through their lesson plans in just a few hours as opposed to the six hours of instruction it takes in school . 	0
WD	7999	Actually , I don ’ t remember any teacher I worked with ever saying a negative word about homeschooling . 	0
WD	8000	If you show respect to the teachers , they just might return the favor . 	0
WD	8001	I was rather offended at the teacher bashing . 	0
WD	8002	In a class of 25 this takes some time , but I believe it is a good thing for students to hear the various perspectives and express their views among their peers . 	0
WD	8003	This is because there is no classroom management to deal with , and there are often questions and discussion during lessons . 	0
WD	8004	I don ' t think that the big school model is very effective . 	0
WD	8005	Private through 8th grade then public HS . 	0
WD	8006	This idea looks logical on a Macro level sure . . . but it would take at least a couple generations before it paid off . 	0
WD	8007	Temperaments considered . 	0
WD	8008	Pros and cons must be weighed . 	0
WD	8009	For many parents , the Big Kindergarten Question causes much angst . 	0
WD	8010	With my daughter , I would have preferred a redshirt option but I had no choice because she has a December birthday . 	0
WD	8011	A lot of my friends feel the stress : Kindergarten or preschool ? 	0
WD	8012	At least that ’ s how it seems . 	0
WD	8013	Your child ’ s future success starts RIGHT NOW ! 	0
WD	8014	As do long-term educational goals : Will my kid still get into Harvard if he starts kindergarten without knowing how to write his name ? 	0
WD	8015	Private schools = better education ? 	0
WD	8016	I believe he ’ s ready because : * He knows his ABCs , writes his name , recognizes a few sites words and grasps basic math concepts . 	0
WD	8017	For me , the decision was made long ago : Kindergarten get ready for Ryan . 	0
WD	8018	Where will the child find the best role models , social circles , and friends ? 	0
WD	8019	Not necessarily but it typically has a stronger sense of community and common morals among families . 	0
WD	8020	Most wasteful in history ! 	0
WD	8021	Throwing good money after bad never works . 	0
WD	8022	Just look at how our government is run now . 	0
WD	8023	Ten girls were shot ; five of them died . 	0
WD	8024	If you don ' t want the liberals corrupting your child with issues such as mandatory acceptance of homosexuality , private schools are the only way to go . 	1
WD	8025	There is no education in public schools any more ! 	0
WD	8026	And shaming parents over it is only going to further the divide when it comes to schooling . 	0
WD	8027	It ' s not that I was taught that it was wrong , it was never a topic that was brought up . 	0
WD	8028	Lately I ' ve been thinking more seriously about my single-sex education after devouring Sheryl Sandberg ' s now infamous Lean In . 	0
WD	8029	One of Sandberg ' s bigger points is that a lot of work needs to be done long before women are in careers , graduate school , or even college , in order to teach them how to lean in . 	0
WD	8030	When people find out I ' m the product of eight years of all-girls ' schooling they often ask what the best part of the experience was . 	0
WD	8031	I usually answer , only half-joking , " I rarely had to shave my legs . " 	0
WD	8032	In Lean In Sandberg explains that as a child she used to organize all the neighborhood children and tell them what to do . 	0
WD	8033	But to this day she cringes when her siblings tell this story because : " When a girl tries to lead , she is often labeled bossy . 	0
WD	8034	Given this focus on childhood and adolescence I ' m surprised that all-girls ' schools haven ' t been discussed in the same breath as Sandberg ' s long-term project . 	0

WD	8036	My professional , adult self certainly understands this sentiment , but my 13-year-old self would have been confused . 	0
WD	8037	But it turns out , she ’ s not the only one with this problem , and , in fact , given the rapid increase in single-sex programs in public schools , it looks like the trouble may only be spreading . 	0
WD	8038	Take a look at the recently-released November 2010 Arkansas Department of Education ’ s Application for School Improvement Grants . 	0
WD	8039	It explains that Jacksonville High School ( JHS ) initiated The Freshman Academy “ to help incoming freshmen who needed extra help with academics and social / emotional needs , ” a laudable goal . 	0
WD	8040	Oh come on . 	0
WD	8041	As a visiting student at Barnard College years ago , I attended the transfer students ’ orientation where each student was asked to explain why she had chosen Barnard . 	0
WD	8042	I ’ ll never forget one woman ’ s response : Well , I went to an all-girls elementary school and an all-girls middle school and an all-girls high school , and when I got to my co-ed college , I didn ’ t know how to function around the boys , so I decided to transfer to Barnard . 	0
WD	8043	Well , that ’ s one solution . 	0
WD	8044	I think I laughed at the time . 	0
WD	8045	Instead of using the program to meet its designated goals , JHS leadership used “ the Academy as a dual gender reassimilation because the students were coming from gender-based feeder schools . 	0
WD	8046	The Academy became a chance for the students to get back together after being separated in the Jacksonville Boys Middle School and the Jacksonville Girls Middle School . ” 	0
WD	8047	These same children go to school where they could be introduced to bullying and drugs , and have their education ruined by undisciplined , uncontrolable , disruptive classmates . 	0
WD	8048	But here ’ s the thing : sending my child to a private school does not exempt me from paying city and state taxes that help fund public schools , nor would I want it to . 	0
WD	8049	In an ideal world , I would be in full support of such ideas but in reality , this issue is far more complex ; embracing children with different requirements and potentials . 	0

WD	8057	@oommph - here you get to a sensitive subject - modern science contains hardly any proper science , just compare the exam papers from the past decade with those from the 70s and 80s . 	0
WD	8058	You ' re also making the mistake of directly comparing discrete subjects from school with a more broad-based approach used by home educators . 	0
WD	8059	We ' ve even done addition and subtraction exercises on a flight home from a holiday before now , and in a Parliamentary committee room one evening , so you can see we ' re all quite flexible about learning . 	0
WD	8060	Forcing prayer upon them is tantamount to removing their ability to decide for themselves whether they would like to be an atheist or not . 	0
WD	8061	He ' s interested now , so we cover the subject now and he ' ll learn it much quicker because of that interest . 	0
WD	8062	Also consider that school is about 25% efficient , so of the five hours a day of nominal lesson time , you lose a fair bit in disruptions , admin , not understanding ( or not listening to ) the topic and having it explained again , finishing the exercise and waiting while it ' s explained again to someone else , etc . Home education doesn ' t take long holidays like school does , so if you work it out , the 250 useful hours of learning at school during a year is easily matched and exceeded by home educators who are doing low-key , low-pressure teaching all the time . 	0

WD	8071	Even if granted , I would have to go through this process on an annual basis and , at any point the LEA could refuse my application and force my child into school . 	0

WD	8076	Today , I received a copy of a letter that my local MP sent to the education secretary , Ed Balls . 	0
WD	8077	I would also have to apply to my local authority for approval which may , or may not , be granted . 	0
WD	8078	It would be compulsory for me to register with the local authority and a criminal offence for me not to . 	0
WD	8079	Badman ' s recommendations would change what home education means to us – a positive and successful part of our family life – into an ongoing battle with the state . 	0
WD	8080	I am not a home-education evangelist and neither do I have any problem with the concept of school , but I do know that home education works for us . 	1
WD	8081	Consequently , the outcome , far from being one of ‘ liberation ’ , can actually cement oppression , simply because the bigger picture hasn ’ t been considered . 	0
WD	8082	NO ! 	0
WD	8083	From my own experience , I can vouch for the truth of the previous statement . 	0
WD	8084	Many sociologists agree that females are , " unable to perform if they are not at least 50% of a class , they feel pressured by stereotype threat and the potential for gender bias , and so a 100% same-sex class would seem to unlock the potential for all females " ( Campbell 7 ) . 	0
WD	8085	And so , one can argue that a single-sex education can more accurately focus the learning needs of the targeted sex ; but does that secluded sex suffer from the lack of the opposite ? 	0
WD	8086	We must first come to realize that while males and females are not two different species , that are very different when it comes to learning , expression , and overall being . 	0
WD	8087	So , will a single-sex education make you smarter ? 	0
WD	8088	Nonetheless , it has been an on-going , contentious issue for society as to whether a single-sex or co-ed environment provides a superior education . 	0
WD	8089	Contrary to popular belief , the 500 girls that went to my school were not closeted-bible-loving-anti-social-feminists and we did , in fact , socialize with members of the opposite sex . 	0
WD	8090	I spent the last four years of my life in a private , catholic , all girls college preparatory high school and while one may say that I missed out on the standard , social facets of a typical high school experience ; I would argue till death that my all girls high school experience was something I wouldn ' t trade for the world . 	1
WD	8091	I , myself , felt more open and confident to participate in an all girls setting . 	0
WD	8092	I had classmates in high school that flourished in an all-girls setting , by allowing themselves to say and do things they wouldn ' t have done in the company of boys . 	0
WD	8093	Seems a tad delusional to me . 	0
WD	8094	For us , we are having the opposite issue -- we are sending our 4 YO twins to kindergarten early because they are academically , socially and physically ready . 	0
WD	8095	They miss the cut off by three months here , so it ' s been an issue finding a placement for them . 	0
WD	8096	So all this redshirting means that they are likely to have kids who are 2 years older then them in the same class as them by first grade . 	0
WD	8097	But I don ' t bring it up and it ' s " yeah , us too , so how is your dd liking her new music teacher ? " 	0
WD	8098	So this mom is just annoying as Hell - heck , I don ' t think she realizes my kid is too . 	0

WD	8102	I knew a few kids that it happened to . 	0
WD	8103	The latter point is crucial , as parents who opt to pay have prioritised education in their households and will provide a more supportive home environment – which is a key determinant of educational success . 	0
WD	8104	Even if there was some marginal evidence of an increase in gain of quality , it is questionable as to whether or not this could be retained on a larger scale . 	0
WD	8105	Furthermore , and there is no evidence to suggest that the “ competition effect ” of low-cost private schools helps to aid in the process of put increasing pressure for improvements in the quality of public schools ( in fact , private schools do the opposite , draining and pauperising the public sector ) . 	0
WD	8106	The narrative surrounding the causality of any ( flawed ) claims of difference in learning outcomes tends to relate to teacher attendance and school accountability . 	0
WD	8107	Even private schools that charge the lowest fees will not help extend access to the 57 million children not in school today . 	0
WD	8108	Proponents of low-cost , private schools argue that privatised schools offer a model of higher educational quality ; but it is here that the evidence is highly contested and inconclusive . 	0
WD	8109	Proponents tend to be highly selective in quoting what is often flawed , and superficial research about improved learning outcomes . 	0
WD	8110	The biggest flaw is that most comparative studies fail to control for the socio-economic status of children as well as the self-evident motivation of parents . 	0
WD	8111	I believe in discipline , accountability , and excellence . 	0
WD	8112	After all , I have a Master of Arts in Teaching , I did my time doing internships and student teaching , and I am experienced at teaching in the classroom . 	0
WD	8113	The proponents of privatised education argue that private schools make a difference by ensuring that teachers are in the classroom and that schools are accountable to parents . 	0
WD	8114	If so , the coherent response should be to invest in teachers within the public system : expanding and improving training and support , making school inspectorates work effectively and strengthening school management committees . 	0
WD	8115	These things are not attainable in public schools because the poor teachers and administrators are worried about getting sued by the parents for everything . 	0
WD	8116	It would only be fair , that if we were to bring Christian Protestant prayer back into the schools that we also allow for Catholic prayer , Muslim prayer and yes , even Satanic prayer to have their place within the school system . 	0
WD	8117	At best , it will create a lot of grumpy students who are forced to say something that they don ’ t believe teaching them hypocrisy and that religion is just something you say . 	0
WD	8118	Why would a public school , a school that isn ’ t designated as a specific Christian school , bring back Christian prayer into the schools ? 	0
WD	8119	It made me cringe to know that us Christians were depending on government , school boards and people who don ’ t subscribe to their faith to bring back prayer into the schools . 	0
WD	8120	While I am a Christian , and I follow Jesus , I don ’ t believe that bringing ‘ prayer back into the schools ’ will do anything of value to our school system , our students or our city . 	1
WD	8121	Why would we even expect them too or be disappointed if / when they frown upon it ? 	0

WD	8269	To believe ‘ one size first all ’ is clearly coming from people who have never suffered from learning difficulties themselves , from bullying , from the physically ‘ sick with dread ’ feeling one gets on the Sunday knowing that tomorrow is a school day . 	0
WD	8270	I am one of 4 children , my sister thrived in mainstream school , so my parents let her stay there , my two brothers went to a different school altogether , school for boys with learning difficulties and they thrived in their school . 	0
WD	8271	Parents should have a right to raise their children any way they wish , but when they are failing to provide even the most basic elementary skills and knowledge they are depriving their kids of a chance to succeed in life . 	0
WD	8272	I ’ m sick to death of it ! 	0
WD	8273	Since the age of 10 I ’ ve had to put up with people judging something they don ’ t understand , telling my parents that they ’ re wrong for home schooling me ( even though I could not have been happier ) , they never asked me ( the one being home schooled ) how I felt about it , if they did they still wouldn ' t have listened , they ' ve made their mind up and they are sticking with their inexperienced views . 	0
WD	8274	Gathered around the flagpole of their elementary , middle , and high schools , they will cry out to God for forgiveness , favor , and protection for the coming year . 	0
WD	8275	Yet there are many people and groups , like FFRF , that find the peaceful prayers of this gathering of Christian students to be threatening . 	0
WD	8276	Parents seem to think not : an opinion poll commissioned by the BBC found that 60 per cent of adults do not support the enforcement of the law ( that figure drops for older people , with more than 50 per cent of over-65s believing it should be upheld ) . 	0
WD	8277	As Clarence Powell himself says in the Post article : “ A good education is not an option . 	0
WD	8278	It “ breeds divisiveness and bullying , ” and can even “ build walls between public school students who would otherwise get along . ” 	0
WD	8279	What is this “ spontaneous eruption of religiosity ” that FFRF finds to be so threatening to students at public schools ? 	0
WD	8280	All our children are different so why should we teach them all in the same way / style , surly that ’ s just common sense ? 	0
WD	8281	However , if I were to have another child , who knows , maybe if I feel he / she will benefit from being homeschooled that will most definitely be the road I go down . 	0
WD	8282	I ’ ll state the obvious : some boys do ; some don ’ t . 	0
WD	8283	Agree with Moore that our children are not to be sacrificed for a utopian ideal that is just not going to happen any time soon . 	0
WD	8284	It also says to not use God ' s name in vain . 	0
WD	8285	she is academically ahead of the curve , she is a social butterfly ( which she did NOT get from her wallflower mother ) , she didn ' t suffer for me deciding that i was very capable , tyvm , of teaching her myself , and that " socializing " at the park and the play areas at the mall was fine for learning how to interact with her peers . 	0
WD	8286	she was allowed to " just be a kid " until she started school at 5 , and for every one of the last 4 years she has continued to " just be a kid " . 	0
WD	8287	Having said that , a private education is no guarentee of a job , nor that you will always have that job . . . 	0
WD	8288	I have seen plenty of people being shown the door in the corporate world for being incompetent , lazy . 	0
WD	8289	A few points , the " perceived advantages " were hardly touched on in this article . 	0
WD	8290	I know there are some advantages at private schools , having gone to a woefully basic selective high school . 	1
WD	8291	eg daughter in yr 10 decided not to do a science for yr 11 , i received a call from her academic advisor about this , and how did i feel about the career choices she was shutting the door on . 	0
WD	8292	I really appreciated the call , as it meant someone genuinely cared about her future . 	0
WD	8293	stupid , or getting their hand caught in the till . . . . . the boss does not care where you went to school when it comes to firing for these " crimes " . 	0
WD	8294	I am delighted with the education my kids are getting at a private Catholic school , for the fact that trouble makers are dealt with , resources are good , and it is hard to put into words , but someone is keeping an eye on them all the time . 	0
WD	8295	I am democrat and I vote just like everybody else , but I can see the public school system just isn ' t what it used to be and that ' s why I want to send her to private school . 	0
WD	8296	If we could afford it , I would home school and be done with the system all together . 	0
WD	8297	would this happen in a state school ? 	0
WD	8298	I doubt it , as there are not the funds for a full time academic advisor . 	0
WD	8299	He also couldn ' t seem to learn to read . 	0
WD	8300	In the public school , our son was more well-adjusted with better manners and generally happier , but didn ' t receive appropriate levels of OT and ST . 	0
WD	8301	Our contention all along , no matter where he goes to school , is that everyone consider the whole child - not just the academic gains or his emotional well-being but the totality of our son as a person . 	0
WD	8302	Instead , he was given private placement in a non-public school . 	0
WD	8303	At his year end IEP , we pressed for appropriate services in the public school . 	0
WD	8304	Despite all this , he seemed happy enough with his peers in the special education classroom ; he was a bubbly , outgoing , talkative boy . 	0
WD	8305	They weren ' t actively mean to him - they just gave him a wide berth . 	0
WD	8306	He was invited to 1 birthday party of a non-disabled peer ( God bless that little girl and her parents ! ) but no other classmates with disabilities came and the other children stayed away from my son . 	0
WD	8307	A stark difference is the culture of the non-public school versus the public school . 	0
WD	8308	In the non-public school , while they have more OT and ST and he is making progress academically , he is having behavior problems . 	0
WD	8309	WAKE UP AMERICA , PLEASE ! 	0
WD	8310	Saying a student or a teacher can ' t pray is a OBVIOUS VIOLATION OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ! 	1
WD	8311	" How long will you waiver between two opinions ? " 	0
WD	8312	Either there is Religious Freedom or there is not . 	0
WD	8313	Give me a break ! 	0
WD	8314	Hello , I constantly hear and read the cliches ( no offense ) , " I am not ______ , but I don ' t the ______ should do _______ . " . 	0
WD	8315	It by definition must be NUMERO UNO in all areas of life . 	0
WD	8316	Well , duh , it is this simple : Religion is a structure of beliefs that influence everything you do , think , and say . 	0
WD	8317	Why ? 	0
WD	8318	All or Nothing people , there cannot be middle ground . 	0
WD	8319	In India , for example , low-cost , private schools often pay less than one fifth of a teacher ' s salary . 	0
WD	8320	These low-cost private schools share a common thread in that they extract a profit from the fees received , by either employing teachers who lack training and / or qualifications , or by paying teachers much lower salaries than those earned by teachers in government schools . 	0
WD	8321	UK aid is supposed to be focused on ending extreme poverty and support for low-cost private schools inherently contradicts this ; instead , such schools actually exacerbate inequality . 	0
WD	8322	Typically teachers are given short-term contracts ; they can be hired and fired at the whim of the private provider : this has dangerous systemic effects on the status of teachers and the credibility of the teaching profession . 	0
WD	8323	For parents with four children , living on a dollar a day , paying $8 or more per child per month consumes more than their entire income . 	0
WD	8324	DFID concedes that in India , “ no schools charging below $8 are able to perform well ” . 	0
WD	8325	DFID has found that : “ Evidence does suggest that there are serious equity and choice barriers associated with the growth of low cost private schools ” , yet , it seems that these concerns are not enough to stop new and further DFID investments . 	0
WD	8326	In such contexts , parents may choose to send just one child to the low-cost school ; and usually boys are prioritised , thereby excluding girls and children with disabilities . 	0
WD	8327	Depriving your child of a basic education is a form of child abuse . 	0
WD	8328	It can ruin your child ' s whole life . 	0
WD	8329	Home schooling should be illegal unless the parent can demonstrate that they are providing the same level of education as a public school . 	1
WD	8330	There should be a core national curriculum and testing to ensure children are achieving at least a basic level of education . 	0
WD	8331	In an increasingly complex , global technological society , all people need to have a basic understanding of science , technology and local and global culture , just to be able to function and make informed decisions . 	0
WD	8332	I don ' t see any need for home schooling any child unless the child has special needs or learning difficulties . 	1
WD	8333	If public schools are under-performing , then the public education system needs to be improved . 	0
WD	8334	Public education in the US seems to be a self-perpetuating disaster , with ignorant , uneducated , unqualified people on school boards deciding what children should learn . 	0
WD	8335	No amount of teachers and staff can keep students from throwing up a prayer before class or a test or before they eat lunch . 	0
WD	8336	As a student , i think schools should definately support prayer in schools . 	1
WD	8337	Children who don ' t want to pray don ' t have to , and those who do can have their concentration to do so . 	0
WD	8338	As far as a moment of silence during homeroom , I say why not ? . 	0
WD	8339	I fully understand nonbelievers or nonreligious people who dont pray , but their moment of silence can be used for relaxation or even sleep if they want . 	0
WD	8340	A moment of silence doesnt require students or teachers to pray ; Prayer isnt even mentioned in the words , so why make a big deal of it ? . 	0
WD	8341	Unfortunately , we have millions of kids and not all families have the resources to homeschool . 	0
WD	8342	In many underresourced schools , it ’ s the aggressive PTAs that raise the money for enrichment programs and willful parents who get in the administration ’ s face when a teacher is falling down on the job . 	0
WD	8343	And parents have a lot of power . 	0
WD	8344	If I have kids , I will probably homeschool them , because I think that homeschooling fosters real interest and excitement in issues , compared to the stressful motivators of grades and standardized testing . 	1
WD	8345	I also went to public school in a wealthy area in San Diego . 	0
WD	8346	I went to private school in " the hood " in Los Angeles . 	0
WD	8347	Why ? 	0
WD	8348	Private school wins , no matter where you go . 	1
WD	8349	Granted , this should be taught at home . 	0
WD	8350	Children are taught , not only the mandatory curriculum , but also how to be considerate , disciplined and respectful . 	0
WD	8351	In the future , should I have children , they will without a doubt be enrolled in private schools , K-12 , just as I was . 	0
WD	8352	But if you know that what your child is being taught at school emphasizes what you ' re teaching them at home and they ' re being supervised at all times , and they ' re getting a good education , how does that not make sense ? 	0
WD	8353	No self control at all . 	0
WD	8354	There is widespread complaint among parents that children are tested too young and too often , teaching them only to pass tests so that civil servants can compile ultimately meaningless statistics . 	0
WD	8355	More and more parents are choosing to home educate because the school system fails their children . 	0
WD	8356	Under the new regulations though , they would have the legal right to enter my home and interview my child alone in a room to " check " for signs of abuse , not because of any good reason to suspect abuse is taking place , but simply because I have chosen to home educate . 	0
WD	8357	The education officers who liaise with home-educators are trained teachers , not social workers , and so are not trained in the highly specialised field of child abuse . 	0
WD	8358	He claims that home education is the perfect cover for child abuse , but provides no evidence to support this claim . 	0
WD	8359	My greatest concern about Badman , though , is his suggestion throughout the report that being at home rather than with " professionals " means that the child is at a " greater risk of harm " . 	0
WD	8360	As with so much legislation that the government has managed to get through parliament under the emotive banner of " child welfare " , this proposed legislation peddles the idea that children can only be dealt with by professionals . 	0
WD	8361	This report is a solution without a problem . 	0
WD	8362	No , because what the report implies is that if you send your child to a school , you are less likely to be a child abuser . 	0
WD	8363	Will education officers also be going into schools and taking each child into a room by themselves to " check for signs of abuse " ? 	0
WD	8364	This superintendent was trying every possible way to improve the children ' s education and the union shot it down . 	0
WD	8365	If you can afford to send your kids to a private school or if you can get them into a charter school do it . 	1
WD	8366	I have many resources available to me , my classes meet all the standards to get a high school diploma , and I ' m about to start working on university applications . 	0
WD	8367	This particular evening ’ s crowd , however , fell into the interested camp . 	0
WD	8368	Go on Netflix and watch " Waiting for Superman " . 	0
WD	8369	Quite the eye opener . 	0
WD	8370	It ' s not uncommon for public school teachers to send their own kids to private schools . 	0
WD	8371	Most of the homeschoolers I knew growing up were the stereotypical Christian homeschoolers with strict parents who didn ' t do anything secular or know anything about the real world . 	0
WD	8372	In this documentary the superintendent of schools in Washington DC offered to double teachers salaries if they were willing to give up their tenure and get out of the teacher ' s union . 	0
WD	8373	( Teachers get tenure after only 2 years of teaching which makes it virtually impossible to fire them for any reason . ) 	0
WD	8374	They could choose to stay tenured and keep their salary or give it up and double their salary . 	0
WD	8375	The teacher ' s union refused to allow it to be voted on by the teachers . 	0
WD	8376	One solution to the problem of how to set standards for schools that has grown increasingly popular in the U . S . is the use of private schools . 	0
WD	8377	It ’ s essential . 	0
WD	8378	I graduated and went back and got an MBA . 	0
WD	8379	I have my own opinions on this debate . 	0
WD	8380	The debate points have changed little while both homeschool and public school have changed greatly ! 	0
WD	8381	I hold two bachelor degrees , graduated Magna Cum Laude from a public university , and taught in the public school system . 	0
WD	8382	First , may I point out that I am a product of homeschool . 	0
WD	8383	You basically get one opportunity to do it . 	0
WD	8384	I accidentally unleashed a firestorm debate on Facebook by simply asking for homeschool information from my homeschooling friends . 	0
WD	8385	The debate between homeschool and public school has been taking place for longer than I even know . 	0
WD	8386	Instead of receiving said advice , I started a debate of homeschool versus public school and socialization versus the lack thereof . 	0
WD	8387	When I graduated , state law did not yet allow ( or perhaps had just allowed . 	0
WD	8388	I graduated from homeschool in November of 1994 , a semester early . 	0
WD	8389	Most Americans are in favor of prayer in public school because they realize that there is something to be gained from the open acknowledgement of God ' s existence . 	0
WD	8390	Homeschoolers , on the other hand , frequently extend their everyday classroom in real community settings and interactions . 	0
WD	8391	When my kids got old enough for school , I sent them to private school and they were ready for University work . 	0
WD	8392	Some consider public school to be an artificial setting with students being locked behind school gates characterized by forced silence , age-segregation and school bells . 	0
WD	8393	There is pressure for all our pupils today in school – in fact far too much and too early . 	0
WD	8394	We have become a very narrow exam based factory where the ‘ whole ’ person does not appear to be as important as Maths , English and Verbal Reasoning ! 	0
WD	8395	Everyone needs to be invested in our public schools in order for them to get better . 	0
WD	8396	Ditto , social justice and pastoral care . 	0
WD	8397	I recall two girls at my high school had a parent die . 	0
WD	8398	We were never formally told , we just swept it under the carpet . . . i still feel gulity for never saying " so sad for you , how can I help you now that you mum has died . " 	0
WD	8399	At Private schools , a food roster is started , and kids are told to reach out . . 	0
WD	8400	I know it may see , irrelevant , but people care more . . . for me , this is the perceived advantage of private schooling . 	0
WD	8401	Boys and girls going through their teens together is a far more realistic and healthy arrangement than either single sex girls school or a school where girls join the boys in sixth form . 	0
WD	8402	The teenage years are perhaps the most turbulent we experience and during this period growing up side by side as the norm and mixing with the opposite sex is a powerful and important life skill . 	0
WD	8403	Just learning and knowing how to interact with each other , feeling comfortable , going to parties and just appreciating from a boy ’ s view that girls are not some ‘ alien creature ’ not to be talked to are vital factors in helping children to adapt to society as a whole . 	0
WD	8404	Parents who send their children to private schools do support public schools . 	0
WD	8405	So , how would this work exactly ? 	0
WD	8406	I bet you are going to do everything within your power to make it better . 	0
WD	8407	Your local school stinks and you do send your child there ? 	0
WD	8408	It is very costly , but I believe that the two things you can give your children are a good education and lots of love . 	0
WD	8409	The moral law never alters for the noblest or the weakest ; it remains abidingly and eternally the same . ” 	0
WD	8410	Regardless of how the U . S . Supreme Court has ruled , we must each , as Oswald Chambers declared , realize that “ God ’ s laws are not watered down to suit anyone ; if God did that He would cease to be God . 	0
WD	8411	We are living witnesses that truly “ the Lord does not hold such a nation guiltless . ” 	0
WD	8412	If you can I would suggest Private schooling . 	1
WD	8413	Worked for us . 	0
WD	8414	I guess it depends on your child as well and the dynamics of your family ( boys / girls / both / number of kids ) . 	0
WD	8415	We have 2 boys and they are going to a boys only private school and we ' re thinking of sending them to a boys only High school as well . 	0
WD	8416	Your local school stinks but you don ’ t send your child there ? 	0
WD	8417	Choose Your Pace , Choose Your Subjects Your only child will have the educational freedom to choose what he wants to learn and in a pace that he finds comfortable . 	0
WD	8418	At the same time , the advantages of homeschooling attracted me a great deal , ” she says . 	0
WD	8419	I didn ’ t want to deny him that . 	0
WD	8420	A school is a place where my only child can be with other children . 	0
WD	8421	“ I wanted to be sure I was doing the right thing . 	0
WD	8422	Jessica , parent of an only child who wanted to homeschool her son , gathered a long list of pros and cons from her interactions with other parents who were homeschooling their children . 	0
WD	8423	They are reported to be performing on par with regular schoolchildren at college , universities and at work . 	0
WD	8424	It is estimated that there are currently two million children coming under the homeschooling program . 	0
WD	8425	The trend of homeschooling is indeed catching on with growth rate of 7 to 15 percent per year . 	0
WD	8426	Advantages Of Homeschooling Your Only Child Many parents of single children toy with the idea of homeschooling their child at least once during their child ’ s tenure at school . 	0
WD	8427	I will never let my kids go to public school unless the teachers can prove they can teach . 	1
WD	8428	what a bunch of hogwash . . . dekalb county schoold district in jacked up georgia is not worth pigs poop . . . as a matter of fact , almost all public schools in dekalb county is lower than whale dung . . . . teachers dont care . . . . I am all for Private Schools . 	1

WD	8430	Teachers pay should be based on performance . 	0
WD	8431	But that did not turn out to be the long-term problem . 	0
WD	8432	Our schools are taking God out of the schools and that is my main deciding factor . 	0
WD	8433	And I think its every parents right to chose to educate their child as they see fit . 	0
WD	8434	Kids have too much homework ; no one I know who goes to school gets enough sleep . 	0

WD	8438	You don ' t have as much busywork . 	0
WD	8439	Maybe for the people who live in that neighborhood , homeschooling isn ' t the better option . 	0
WD	8440	But I had to go to my local public school to take the PSAT and someone was getting arrested as we were leaving . 	0
WD	8441	Thanks , Michael Byrd 	0
WD	8442	But I live in a community that could be considered a little rednecked and the extremes are a little more common here . 	0
WD	8443	But , hey , my first year as a full time student in college was at 13 , which I ' m not anyore , but i feel like im behind because all of the General facts about things you learn in regular school , I don ' t know . 	0
WD	8444	I think that the superiority over one type of schooling doesn ' t exist . 	0
WD	8445	It all depends on the person . 	0
WD	8446	I went to public school and was in every club , president of some , and also was in the Student Body Presidency . 	0
WD	8447	Public schooling creates lots of oppurtunities to meet large groups of people . 	0
WD	8448	This was good for me because my type of personality is to lead people , though usually through manipulation bargains and other types of persuasion , not because im a strong leader . 	0
WD	8449	At the same time I signed up for homechooling so that I could launch myself into college . 	0
WD	8450	I ' ve never done regular homeschooling though . 	0
WD	8451	So I don ' t have grounds on it . 	0
WD	8452	Honestly , of all the groups of people to be put through " separate but equal , " gender should be the least likely . 	0
WD	8453	Bottom line : Yet again left wingers hate competition and choice and want to force EVERYONE into their failed system ( see also : Obamacare ) . 	0
WD	8454	I ' ve known people who were HS where their parents didn ' t really teach them all that much . 	0
WD	8455	Public schools are not going to change even if you and every other parent went up there and complained everyday because the unions won ' t allow it . 	0
WD	8456	There are still great teachers in the public schools - lets stand behind them . 	0
WD	8457	That finding will no doubt come as a surprise to those who believe private schools are intrinsically superior . 	0
WD	8458	The simple fact is that these students will do well in any education venue . 	0
WD	8459	Instead of keeping these bright and well-behaved students in the public schools as models to other students , private schools take only the best and claim that their system is better since their student body is so much more elite . 	0
WD	8460	Responsible homeschooling families attempt to have open and honest communication , preparing children to deal with situations as they arise . 	0
WD	8461	In fact , homeschooled children are often confident , adept at communicating their point of view and capable of making wise choices and responsible decisions . 	0
WD	8462	It ’ s innate , a brain thing . 	0
WD	8463	But I ’ m that way , as is his dad and his sister . 	0
WD	8464	Students with special needs might benefit too . 	0
WD	8465	However , the flexibility provided by the homeschool lifestyle may allow students to develop expertise in other areas such as nature , travel and culture , or budgeting and home management . 	0
WD	8466	Homeschoolers might not study the same topics as peers ' neighborhood schools . 	0
WD	8467	Limited Breadth of Curriculum Some proponents of formal education are concerned that homeschooled students will not receive the breadth of curriculum that children receive in school . 	0
WD	8468	This argument simply does not stand , as most homeschooling families do not live in isolation . 	0
WD	8469	Sheltering Children vs . Strengthening Families A final argument that often crops is that homeschooled children are not prepared to deal with real-world situations . 	0
WD	8470	Families are able to decide how broad or how channeled a child ' s curriculum should be . 	0
WD	8471	They may not receive services from school-based special education staff , but they can receive individualized education in the areas most relevant to their needs . 	0
WD	8472	With our eldest son turning four next year , my partner and I have started discussing when he will go to school - and where . 	0
WD	8473	The problem is the public schools are running the schools poorly . 	1
WD	8474	The private school parents pay for Public , schools , as well as childless parents pay . 	0
WD	8475	So I don ' t blame those that spend more to send their kids to private schools , 	0
WD	8476	The unions are their main priorty , not the child ' s education . 	0
WD	8477	Also , if I hear one more person talk about the lack of “ socialization ” as a reason not to homeschool , I ’ m going to erupt . 	0
WD	8478	So why would anyone want to take their children out of the dominant public education system of our country and attempt to homeschool them on their own ? 	0
WD	8479	That ’ s easy . 	0
WD	8480	Kids do better academically when homeschooled . 	0
WD	8481	I think everyone who is able should consider homeschooling their child . 	1
WD	8482	However , there are also a number of respected private , or independent , schools within easy driving distance , so this is something else for us to consider when planning for our sons ’ educational needs . 	0
WD	8483	Somebody needs to . 	0
WD	8484	I am sick and tired of reading diatribes against homeschooling from those who have never homeschooled , don ’ t have children , or simply have a bias against the Christian overtones related to homeschooling . 	0
WD	8485	It ' s time to disestablish the Church in this country , as well , and allow children to pick any religion ( or none ) in their own time , without the Government pushing them in any direction . 	1
WD	8486	My husband and I both attended public schools . 	0
WD	8487	We aren ' t interested in whether you like it or not . 	0
WD	8488	So we had to do what was best for our children by finding a school that fit the same values we were trying to instill in our children . 	0
WD	8489	Teachers voted against everything us as parents were trying to accomplish . 	0
WD	8490	Very little changed with all our efforts . 	0
WD	8491	Reality sunk in . 	0
WD	8492	We put all of our effort into making the system better , joined every group , volunteered at the school and all events . 	0
WD	8493	Our family switched back to the charter school after doing exactly what the writer suggested . 	0
WD	8494	I ' ve had my children in parochial school , switched to public and now a charter school . 	0
WD	8495	That says something about our morals or ethics if you will . 	0
WD	8496	Even with aides , a teacher often has to slow down and / or pause the lesson to address certain disruptive behaviors ( saw this in my dcs ' class last year , which had multiple inclusion students , some of whom were non-verbal & had daily tantrums & outbursts ) . 	0
WD	8497	At any rate I do have a point to make . 	0
WD	8498	The fact that it made the news that these two kids were honest is amazing . 	0
WD	8499	The store management even provided them with some sort of reward . 	0
WD	8500	All of this attention and a reward for doing the right thing . 	0
WD	8501	Obviously , I touched a nerve and found out first-hand the extent of the cohesiveness among homeschooling community . 	0
WD	8502	As the elder Powell says , the failure to do so can be incredibly difficult for a child to overcome . 	0
WD	8503	Having those distractions ( not to mention having additonal aides in the room ) can be counterproductive to other students . 	0
WD	8504	People were able to learn social skills long before there were schools . 	0
WD	8505	You don ' t need school for this , since this can be provided by a properly functioning community of friends and relations . 	0
WD	8506	It provides children with the chance to work and play with their peers and promotes the development of social skills and interacting with people outside of the family . " 	0
WD	8507	@ Danot " There ' s a lot more to be learned at school than the syllabus . 	0
WD	8508	Home schooling , on the other hand , promotes independence , especially independence from the state - which is the reason totalitarians hate home schooling so much , and ban it so happily . 	0
WD	8509	What schools actually promote , of course , is not " social skill " but social conformity , social obedience , and social subservience to an unelected " authority " external to the family . 	0
WD	8510	That is the kind of thing that parents are supposed to be teaching their kids not to do . 	0
WD	8511	I highly doubt most bad people as kids are thinking to themselves , “ You know what , when I grow up I don ’ t want to be a fireman , I want to hurt people ” . 	0
WD	8512	Maybe just a bad choice or two has led them down a path that they did not intend to be on . 	0
WD	8513	Hell not all bad people are BAD people . 	0
WD	8514	Not all prisoners are bad people . 	0
WD	8515	Not all religious folks are good people . 	0
WD	8516	Now I understand that there is GOOD and BAD in everything . 	0
WD	8517	You know about 60 % of religious people that I have personally met are hypocrites they preach about this and they preach about that and then once they are done putting on there Sunday best they go home drink a fifth and beat their kids . 	0
WD	8518	Last time I checked you were supposed to let God do that kind of work . 	0
WD	8519	Who do you think that you talking to a non-religious person is going to get them to change or believe what you believe . 	0
WD	8520	I ' m sending them there to learn . 	0
WD	8521	Plus , from my own sports experience , age has little to do with sports once you hit the high school level anyway -- I played Varsity Volleyball and Varsity Track as a freshman ( when I was 14 ) . 	0
WD	8522	She claims it makes a " huge " difference for sports . 	0
WD	8523	Personally , I ' m not sending my kids to school to play sports . 	0
WD	8524	I can certainly understand it if the parents feel the kid isn ' t ready , but what I ' m hearing a lot of in our area is parents ( particularly of boys ) doing it because they feel it will make their kid the " class leader " or the " best " in sports ( which is ridiculous IMHO ) . 	0
WD	8525	One of the girls I went to high school with went redshirted two of her three boys because of the sports issue alone ( apparently , she didn ' t know she had the option with the first one but would have redshirted his too if she had known ) . 	0
WD	8526	In Chicago , Illinois ( USA ) , the school district instituted a policy that required 6 YOs to be placed in 1st grade if their parents held them back from Kindergarten . 	0
WD	8527	Redshirting has become such an issue there that the school district felt they had no choice . 	0
WD	8528	Most of the team was made up of seniors and juniors ( who were 3 to 4 years older than me ) . 	0
WD	8529	And really , how can you as a parent feel proud of your child and feel that he is " better " at sports than his classmates when his classmates are 2 years younger than him . 	0
WD	8530	I ' m on the same page as FedUp . 	0
WD	8531	classroom teacher , who often is not special ed certified , has his / her resources & abilities stretched to try to accommodate the special needs in their class . 	0
WD	8532	It isn ’ t necessarily better to have kindergarten classes full of 6- and 7-year-olds . 	0
WD	8533	( A good example is Hope Academy in Concord , N . C . ) 	0
WD	8534	If you can ’ t do that , take advantage of the growing number of schools that offer a combination of homeschooling and formalized classroom experience . 	0
WD	8535	But because there are few voices out there promoting for it , let me make mine loud and clear . 	0
WD	8536	It ’ s a difficult thing to advocate for what you feel may be the best for a child without unduly demeaning the good being done in other settings . 	0
WD	8537	Not just for the academics , but for their protection . 	0
WD	8538	If you can homeschool your child through at least the middle school years , do . 	1
WD	8539	And that ’ s what your goal should be : parenting your child ’ s inner world . 	0
WD	8540	But even if there was a conflict ( there isn ’ t ) , sports don ’ t outweigh what ’ s best for your child ’ s heart . 	0
WD	8541	I know so many of you strive to bring Christ to bear on that setting . 	0
WD	8542	Please know how much I respect and value the hard work and clear calling present in the life of countless teachers and administrators in the public school system . 	0
WD	8543	Let us require the parents to insure those children learn the same subjects , as their age peers , in public or private schools . 	0
WD	8544	Let us required the children to take standardized tests . 	0
WD	8545	And if you experience any difficulty promoting or participating in the event , contact us . 	0
WD	8546	The bible says to pray in private . 	0
WD	8547	That , within itself , is a major problem : these children do not receive that personal contactt with other children of their own ages . 	0
WD	8548	The majority of home schooled children I have met , and had contact with , are smart and get along well with adults , but have an awful time relating to other children . 	0
WD	8549	Happily , some parents realize this , and have their children participate in other groups , such as church , Scouting , 4H , etc . to get that additional group support , and friendships amongst their peers . 	0
WD	8550	They simply do not learn to interact with their peers , and thus are constrained by that pressure , the rest of their lives . 	0
WD	8551	The parents , described in this article , are doing their children a disservice by refusisng to not only let them , but require them to have that knowledge , required in todays workplace . 	0
WD	8552	This is an important part of education , and goes along with the actual learning skills and knowledge required of todays citizen , in order to further their education , get a job and advance through life . 	0
WD	8553	This state needs to immediately back off on the present rules , and fix the problem . 	0
WD	8554	They have robbed them of the chance to advance in life , and that is child abuse . 	0
WD	8555	We do have a lot of private schools around us , we are starting to look into the cost , as ODD is now 3 we figured we should start looking into it . 	0
WD	8556	Early formal education , adult-led activities , single age classes , each child across the country pretty much studying the same thing , in the same way at the same time irrespective of ability , interest or other opportunities . 	0
WD	8557	Funny I really could care less if people are offended by these things , but I am quite concerned that God might be . 	0
WD	8558	Private schools do not receive money from the federal or state governments , so they have significantly more freedom in the types of courses to offer , the types of teachers they hire , and the requirements for graduation . 	0
WD	8559	If you can afford private school ( even if affording means scrimping and saving , or taking out loans ) , chances are that your spawn will be perfectly fine at a crappy public school . 	0
WD	8560	Inclusion can be successful & rewarding for all involved but it also has drawbacks . 	0
WD	8561	It ' s ironic that it is viewed as anti-christian to not want prayer at school and in public venues , to not want " In God We Trust " on our money , and to not want " One nation under God " in the pledge of allegiance because we really haven ' t earned that claim . 	0
WD	8562	Cut down on the ( misogynistic ) bigotry in the classroom and society and there won ' t be any perceived " need " for single-gender classrooms . 	1
WD	8563	Seriously , our society depends on us interacting with each , at the very least , since we each make up over half the damn species ! 	0
WD	8564	In light of that fact , there are only two reasons why students are enrolled in private schools : 1 ) It is a matter of prestige in order to instill an image of elitism , or 2 ) people have been intentionally misled into believing that private schools are " better " than their public counterparts . 	0
WD	8565	So , my high school diploma is a GED which I passed with flying colors and had my choice of colleges to attend . 	0
WD	8566	There is no partnership between the parents and the teachers and as a result , there is a tendancy for the parents to side ( usually unfairly ) with their kids . 	0
WD	8567	Unless you are actively involved with the ongoing education of your children , helping to shape their character and working with them to develop themselves into positive , constructive members of society , then you will wind up with what we are seeing . 	0
WD	8568	The main problem with public schools is parent participation . 	0
WD	8569	What you see is 10% of the parents being involved and the rest of them expect the school system to take care of their kids . 	0
WD	8570	People do not send their kids so they can associate with rich kids , they send them because they know the expectations are higher and that their kids will have a chance at a better education because of it . 	0
WD	8571	A school system that is struggling , against the odds to somehow , marginally educate our children . 	0
WD	8572	There ' s nothing wrong with private schools . 	1
WD	8573	I know several people who said that they wish their parents had waited a year to send them to kindergarten . 	0
WD	8574	DH was 4 when he started school and was only 17 when he graduated from HS . 	0
WD	8575	He hated that everyone was doing everything a year before he could do it . 	0
WD	8576	He was very good at sports though , even though he was a year younger than anyone else on his team . 	0
WD	8577	I honestly made my decision because I had a choice and I just did not feel right personally about sending my DS to Kindergarten at age 4 . 	0
WD	8578	Last year the cut off was October 9th I believe and this year it has been changed to July 1st . 	0
WD	8579	DS ' s birthday is August 30th . 	0
WD	8580	I did not wait to send DS because I wanted him to have an edge over anyone . 	0
WD	8581	Age has nothing to do with ability and if he were the type who would struggle , he would struggle regardless of when he started school . 	0
WD	8582	I do not compare my children with other people ' s children . 	0
WD	8583	What appears at first glimpse to be good progress might not be , according to psychotherapist Melinda Clayton , who practices in Florida and Colorado . 	0
WD	8584	A study released last August showed that the New York City Department of Education is making good progress toward reforms that will reverse a longstanding practice of segregating special education students in their own classrooms and schools , the New York Times reported . 	0
WD	8585	Ours will be that the State Education system is totally ruined , due to many years of being systematically abused by left-wingers . 	0
WD	8586	I wouldn ' t trust a state school to train a dog , much less raise a child . 	1
WD	8587	Should schools be forcing children to worship anyway ? 	0
WD	8588	I was merely soliciting information from them to add to our decision making process . 	0
WD	8589	For the majority of the children in the school , mainstream would not have been a suitable placement . 	1
WD	8590	Many didn ' t speak at all , had extremely challenging behavior and needed to access the curriculum in a very different way to how they would in a mainstream setting . 	0
WD	8591	As has been mentioned by others it really depends on the child and the resources available . 	0
WD	8592	I am a teacher ( currently SAHM ) and worked in a specialist school for children with severe learning difficulties and ASD . 	0
WD	8593	In some cases , inclusion can work fantastically well . 	1
WD	8594	My school had an inclusion class attached to a local mainstream school . 	0
WD	8595	Their needs can be far better met in a specialist school with specialist teachers and resources . 	0
WD	8596	No offended intended to teachers in mainstream settings-I just think it ' s a lot to ask when they may have a class of 30+ children with completely different needs to consider and limited training in SEN . 	0
WD	8597	The pupils would spend the majority of the time in the inclusion classroom , but spend a few lessons a week in a mainstream class ( with a known teaching assistant ) . 	0
WD	8598	They usually went in for sessions like Art , where the difference in ability is less obvious . 	0
WD	8599	Public school are just as good really , if you find the good ones out of the lot that is - In CT they are recognizable 	1
WD	8600	Every one does not have to pray if you choose not to then that is your choice . 	0
WD	8601	Me being a young teen in school , have witnessed first hand to this and i can truly say that prayer should be allowed in schools . 	1
WD	8602	Not only has it affected the schools it has also affected the homes and the homes and its inhabitants . 	0
WD	8603	I believe that prayer being banned from the public school systems was by far the most uneducated and most of all immoral thing that could have been done . 	1
WD	8604	The United States , a far more religious place than this nation of lost souls , has enshrined that idea in its constitution : the state must not support or endorse any religion , so that people can be free to choose their own without coercion . 	0
WD	8605	But more important than that , imposing a state-sponsored religion is wrong . 	1
WD	8606	Please don ’ t let the ignorance of 10 people ruin a nations well being ! ! ! 	0
WD	8607	Increasingly , girls have been besting boys ’ performance across the board : G . P . A . s , school leadership , graduation rates , college attendance . 	0
WD	8608	No organized prayers or services anywhere on public school board property - FOR ANYONE . 	1
WD	8609	In those cases , children can end up being home-schooled by people who may not have the attitude or aptitude for it . 	0
WD	8610	I went to co-ed schools from kindergarten until the end of 9th grade . 	0
WD	8611	I will have 10 special education students in one class period , and another math teacher with the same class in the same period will have none . 	0
WD	8612	I have ADHD and really struggled with the classroom setting- I had too much energy to stay in my seat , I was making too much noise , I was disturbing the other kids , etc- and because of that I spent virtually all of elementary school on behavior contracts that to this day still fill me with an acute sense of shame . 	0
WD	8613	In middle school , I was severely bullied and isolated . 	0
WD	8614	That led to the development of various mental illnesses in ninth grade , and between that and the ADHD , I couldn ' t handle public school anymore and switched out . 	0
WD	8615	I had some great teachers , I had good grades , and I had a small handful of friends , but ultimately public school did not work for me . 	0
WD	8616	The success of homeschooling depends so much on the student , the parent , and the environment they live in . 	0
WD	8617	I did ten and a half years of public school , and then switched out halfway through ninth grade to homeschool . 	0
WD	8618	I now do online school and I think it works fairly well for me . 	0
WD	8619	Yes , I succeeded in school and was generally an A student , but that was mostly because I ' m naturally intelligent and capable . 	0
WD	8620	Yes , I face social barriers now , but honestly I ' m just as awkward as I was in public school . 	0
WD	8621	I have trouble with self motivation sometimes , and take lots of breaks , but I always get all of my schoolwork done . 	0
WD	8622	And the same goes for any child in any school , as any teacher will tell you . 	0
WD	8623	Frankly , the difference is in the parenting and input , not in the method of education . 	0
WD	8624	Homeschooling is not something I have a problem with . 	1
WD	8625	Same with the daughter . 	0
WD	8626	If he likes it , he ' ll stay , if he doesn ' t like it , he ' ll stay and i ' ll work with the school to sort the problems , if he still doesn ' t get on , i ' ll homeschool . 	0
WD	8627	As a secondary teacher who is currently a SAHM with two kids under 4 , I ' ve applied for my sons ' primary place next year . 	0
WD	8628	60 % of them were homeschooled badly , were not up to speed , had evidently not done much mixing , and the kids themselves struggled to fit in at all for the first few years and did not do as well academically . 	0
WD	8629	They went on to do very well . 	0
WD	8630	40% of them were fantastic and had obviously had superb parenting and a grounded education with lots of input from a variety of educators and people . 	0
WD	8631	However , I have taughth some children who have been homeschooled up to Secondary level . 	0
WD	8632	St . Clair high school would once again have both good and bad consequences because boys would most likely do better because of the presence of girls , but girls would most likely do worse . 	0
WD	8633	If De La Salle had teachers capable of punishing students and keeping the boys on track while in school , then it would most likely be a benefit , if the staff lacks the ability to control the boys , it would be bad . 	0
WD	8634	It breaks my heart when I hear about other teachers ridiculing these students in class or dismissing their needs . 	0
WD	8635	I do know one family over-sheltered homeschoolers who fit the stereotypes ; and I know some AWESOME , WONDERFUL people who go to public school . 	0
WD	8636	Healthy , wonderful people can come out of any education ; same for unhealthy people . 	0
WD	8637	There are such things as homeschool groups , and we get together just for the purpose of socializing . 	0
WD	8638	I have so many AMAZING friends now from homeschool events . 	0
WD	8639	There are exceptions to this , but this is true for the MAJORITY of homeschoolers : you get healthier socialization ! 	0
WD	8640	5 . ) 	0
WD	8641	I could go on forever , but I won ' t . 	0
WD	8642	So those are my main points . 	0
WD	8643	I would think it weird to talk to someone in another grade back at school , but I have friends I can honestly call BFFs ranging from age 11-23 . 	0
WD	8644	Plus , you ' re exposed to a wider age range when you ' re homeschooled . 	0
WD	8645	I can also see how child abusers could use home-schooling as part of their evil plans . 	0
WD	8646	The debate around single sex versus co-educational ( co-ed ) will always be a controversial one . 	0
WD	8647	That ' s nice I suppose . 	0
WD	8648	Everyone interested in education will have their opinion and although data would indicate that single sex girls ’ schools might produce the best results , it would seem to be that there is more to this debate than just academic results . 	0
WD	8649	This is the reality of public education today . 	0
WD	8650	I have experience working in all boys ’ schools and co-eds and although I have not worked in a single sex girls ’ school , I strongly believe that the most important factor in all this is the school itself . 	0
WD	8651	I have a december baby and a may baby — my dec son went to kdg at almost 6 b / c of a sept cutoff and my may son went to kdg at slightly over 5 … . 	0
WD	8652	I didn ’ t debate and didn ’ t lament – - I did what the cutoff suggested AND guess what ? 	0
WD	8653	Around third grade , everything evens out and I see it with all the kids – they are all doing what they are supposed to be doing when I look at both my sons and the rest of their classes . 	0
WD	8654	While history suggests boys are stronger at Maths and Science and girls are more linguistic , I believe this gender divide can be bridged by an educational framework which is inspiring and uses a range of teaching strategies . 	0
WD	8655	I totally agree that this segment was driven by helicopter parents . 	0
WD	8656	We must say that our kids are doing what they should be doing b / c they are who they are and not say things like performing at the top and exceeding this or that because IMO – we just propel the argument . 	0
WD	8657	I did like what they speculated in the segment about what will be with all these kids as adults – I am so curious ! 	0
WD	8658	RB 	0
WD	8659	I have seen this first hand as both a teacher and through lesson observations , as the Headteacher of North Bridge House School , it is the more social dynamic side to fully integrated co-eds that I believe to be so important . 	0
WD	8660	The issue of home schooling is one that always seems to spark a fierce debate , and a story published yesterday by the Washington Post is only likely to add fuel to the fire . 	0
WD	8661	Play , which is really a child ’ s ‘ work , ’ contributes to cognitive , physical , social , and emotional growth . 	0
WD	8662	Christian , Jewish , Muslim , Hindu , Sikh , Buddhist , Jedi , Star Trek , etc . . . 	0
WD	8663	The father doesn ' t appear very well educated since he doesn ' t seem to have steady employment other than being a handyman of some sort . 	0
WD	8664	No religious activities in schools . 	1
WD	8665	If there ' s a demand for single-sex schools , those should be an option available to families . 	0
WD	8666	The best way to respect all religions is to show favoritism to none . 	0
WD	8667	“ Standardized tests and other pressures have changed the trajectory of elementary education . 	0
WD	8668	It is a totally deteriorated system , it needs to be torn down and start over with the same kind of private education that made this country great in the first place . 	0
WD	8669	Too many liberals who have been indoctrinated by public universities that have no standards of right and wrong or decent and immoral . 	0
WD	8670	Tried hard to change the public system . 	0
WD	8671	That ’ s the practice of not starting a child in kindergarten until after his or her sixth birthday . 	0
WD	8672	A 60 Minutes segment this week focused on “ redshirting . ” 	0
WD	8673	The segment has generated a lot of conversation both online and in neighborhoods and preschools . 	0
WD	8674	It isn ’ t because of school-district rules , but is something that parents do to give their child an advantage from kindergarten and beyond . 	0
WD	8675	As the mom of a boy with an August birthday and a September 1 cutoff in our school system , I was torn about the potential advantages of an extra year of preschool . 	0
WD	8676	Including the one my kids attend . 	0
WD	8677	I had the opportunity to discuss this issue with Ann Densmore , EdD , an expert in language and social communication skills in children and co-author of Your Successful Preschooler . 	0
WD	8678	( My husband was not . ) 	0
WD	8679	And believe me it has been an adjustment . 	0
WD	8680	Not just the private to public adjustment but also day care . 	0
WD	8681	The only reason why we decided to take out daughter of private school this year is because of the price . 	0
WD	8682	Up until now we were able to afford it , but with my long commute everyday and gas prices and all other prices not coming down we had to make a very difficult decision . 	0
WD	8683	Not only is the learning environment better and more organized so are the teaching practices . 	0
WD	8684	In the private setting she is not being taught how to pass a test so that the school can remain accredited or whatever she is being taught how to think and organize her ideas , and she is actually graded , and not passed along if she can just get by . 	0
WD	8685	Wow ! ! ! 	0
WD	8686	If I have the choice and the opportunity to do so I will gladly put her back in private scholl without hesitation . 	1
WD	8687	He likes it and seems excited by the prospect of being a big kid in school . 	0
WD	8688	* He knows a lot of the kids who will start kindergarten with him ( thanks to preschool ) . 	0
WD	8689	I like the fact that she is being challenged by her school work and even being pushed to begin learning at least a grade level higher . 	0
WD	8690	* He is familiar with the elementary school , a benefit of having an older sibling . 	0
WD	8691	For example , Ryan recently tried to help a friend at school and the friend ( politely , kindly , rightfully ) declined Ryan ’ s help . 	0
WD	8692	Ryan ’ s feelings were hurt so he hit his friend . 	0
WD	8693	The question mark is his maturity . 	0
WD	8694	He can be impulsive . 	0
WD	8695	Girls like reading ; boys don ’ t . 	0
WD	8696	Not just lip-service investment , or property tax investment , but real flesh-and-blood-offspring investment . 	0
WD	8697	I think my view differs from my gal pals because I was able to leave and see the other side . 	0
WD	8698	She reiterated the fact that it all does depend on the person . 	0
WD	8699	And his wife appears to be so cowed she doesn ' t speak for herself . 	0
WD	8700	Often , those who do well academically / behaviorally are often left on their own unless a parent continually advocates for their dcs in order to ensure that things are done to help them reach their full potential . 	0
WD	8701	As wonderful as it is that students want to help take care of the inclusion students , calming down another student means that the child doing that is taking time away from his / her own learning , not the mention the initial distraction that the outburst created . 	0
WD	8702	The primary responsibility of the education of a child rests on the parents . 	0
WD	8703	This puts a tremendous amount of pressure on me , as I want to help all of my students , but can ' t provide the one-on-one time that my students need during class time . 	0
WD	8704	They went to school with them . 	0
WD	8705	They grew up with them . 	0
WD	8706	The point that I am trying to make here is that special education students already have a learning curve , so to speak , and we as teachers need to do everything we can to assist them . 	0
WD	8707	. 	0
WD	8708	My belief is preschool , kindergarten and even 1st grade should be exciting and fun so kids associate those qualities with learning . 	0
WD	8709	Another thing that I feel parents should be aware of : I personally found that girls who attend all-girls school will go out more to actually meet boys than girls in co-ed schools . 	0
WD	8710	What I mean by this is , girls in co-ed schools will hang out with boys from school ( inside and outside of school ) , yes , but the fact is : they know these boys . 	0
WD	8711	But that ' s just my opinion . 	0
WD	8712	Special education teachers see this and place more students in my classes than in other math teachers ' classes . 	0
WD	8713	I know that seems like such a minor gripe , but trust me , you don ' t want to be surrounded by the bullshit girls can concoct amongst each other when there are no boys to " restrict " certain behaviours . 	0
WD	8714	Whether they can write their names in kindergarten is not the point . 	0
WD	8715	Students can pray all they want together or by themselves , and very few people actually argue against this , at least I think . 	0
WD	8716	Prayer in schools should not be led by a school official ( who is a gov ' t official if we are talking about public schools ) . 	1
WD	8717	I see no reason why kids need to have a school-led prayer , or a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance , for that matter . 	0
WD	8718	If teachers aren ' t willing to step up to the challenge , they shouldn ' t enter the teaching profession in the first place . 	0
WD	8719	Seriously . 	0
WD	8720	But here are my reasons : 1 . ) 	0
WD	8721	As a parent , I support that concept as long as the inclusion doesn ' t come at the expense of the other students in class . 	0
WD	8722	Each of these examples are a bias when there is no balance or equal time given to educate other views in the public schools . 	0
WD	8723	I believe that everyone should be allowed to believe whatever they want to believe and pray to whomever they want to pray . 	0
WD	8724	But what does bug me and what I do feel is unacceptable is when people try to impose they ’ re religious beliefs FORCFULLY on someone else . 	0
WD	8725	Lastly , every person sending their children to private schools will pay for public schools as well through local taxing especially if real estate taxes fund that government system too . 	0
WD	8726	But you must donate so that I can build a better platform to get the word out that I can save people you must help me you must donate and don ’ t forget , don ’ t do this … this and this … or else you will not go anywhere remotely nice when you die . 	0
WD	8727	You know this sort of thing gets to me when people think that they are right about they ’ re religion or topics . 	0
WD	8728	Ignorance is truly bliss . 	0
WD	8729	Now in lieu of that last statement I am not saying that I am right in anyway shape or form . 	0
WD	8730	People are always afraid . 	0
WD	8731	Always thinking of death and what could or won ’ t happen next . 	0
WD	8732	Now if your scared enough and all of a sudden in what seems like coincidence , someone comes up to you and says hey you know what . 	0
WD	8733	I can save you I can save you from what ’ s to come . 	0
WD	8734	If a student wishes to silently pray during my class , I do not have a problem with it . 	1

WD	8738	He admonished his followers : “ Always beware of vowing , it is a risky thing . 	0
WD	8739	So why did we make all of the necessary sacrifices and send our four children through the private sector ? 	0
WD	8740	It ' s individuals like that who take away the right to choose and assuming it ' s just rich people who send their kids shows the ignorance in that statement . 	0
WD	8741	So , I guess we are bad parents because we put our faith in God first and foremost . 	0
WD	8742	The “ evangelical prophet , ” Oswald Chambers ( 1874 – 1917 ) , saw that the empty promises made by so many Christians actually result in great “ spiritual leakage . ” 	0
WD	8743	I agree that this article is a crock ! 	0
WD	8744	My wife and I are both school teachers . 	0
WD	8745	I worked in the public system , and she worked in the Catholic school system in our area . 	0
WD	8746	In fact many middle class and even lower income folks use private education for their children . 	0
WD	8747	If you can ' t manage that then enroll your children in an alternative school . . . it really is that simple . 	0
WD	8748	It also bids the argument that religion plays a roll and it ' s an obvious attack against those schools who are affiliated that way . 	0
WD	8749	The public school system is secular , keep your religious beliefs at home . 	1
WD	8750	Why not use public schools here are a couple reasons they teach liberal sex education , they teach evolution , they teach homosexuality generally at an early age , and some even hold classes about certain religions . 	0

WD	8757	My daughter was 4 when she started kindergarten , turned 5 in late Sept . She thrived socially , but was definitely " middle of the pack " academically till the end of 2nd grade , when something kicked in , and she started caring more about doing well in school . 	0
WD	8758	Yes everyone can stand review but at a point you lose students . 	0
WD	8759	The students can opt out of their accomodations , and they do to save face , further , they are not only hurting themselves , but others in the calss . 	0
WD	8760	The resources teacher ( their aid ) can ' t sit by there side and give them the help and attention they need due to confidentiality . 	0
WD	8761	We have gotten away from this " tracking " mentality , but really , the majority or resource kids I see are no better off . 	0
WD	8762	I have 32 kids in one class and an on level class is mixed beyond belief . 	0
WD	8763	I can attest to the idea that things even out by 3rd grade . 	0
WD	8764	Few children can rise above the poor education of a public school and that is why most of our leaders attended private schools and why they send their children to private schools also . 	0
WD	8765	My kids both have nice professional jobs . 	0
WD	8766	I pay my school taxes but public schools don ' t want my input , just my money . 	0
WD	8767	I just disagree that if public schools went away , all these wonderful educational facilities would magically spring up and everyone would be educated and the world would be a better place to be . 	0
WD	8768	You will never , ever regret it . 	0
WD	8769	Nor will your child . 	0
WD	8770	If you can ’ t do that , explore the many good private Christian schools that are available . 	0
WD	8771	But please , consider doing something . 	0
WD	8772	Pressure to prepare kids for these tests starts as early as kindergarten . 	0
WD	8773	Later , as a parent , I changed direction and became worried about the behaviour that impeded learning and teaching in public schools- behaviour that I witnessed first hand . 	0
WD	8774	Consequently I chose to move my own children from public to private . 	0
WD	8775	I own up to being part of the problem of the weakening of the public system . 	0
WD	8776	I couldn ' t abide that my own values of respect , cooperation and high expectations were not being held for my children in the public system . 	0
WD	8777	The teachers in both systems are the same , but the expectations of the parents are simply different . 	0
WD	8778	I want for my children what my parents did not have to pay for ! 	0
WD	8779	If you have the ability to send your children to private school and choose not to , then it is clear that you love money more than your children . 	0
WD	8780	I helped paint classrooms and wash windows . 	0
WD	8781	Would a moment of silence be out of order ? 	0
WD	8782	This is absolutely the worst piece of garbage I have ever read ! 	0
WD	8783	We did without so we could send our kids to Catholic school . 	0
WD	8784	Why can ' t we have a moment of silence ? 	0
WD	8785	If public school parents don ' t like their ' crappy ' school then let THEM make changes . 	0
WD	8786	Other parents did landscaping , waxed floors , supervised recess , helped in the kitchen , repaired the furnace and water heater , maintained the school bus , and re-sealed the driveway . 	0
WD	8787	This is the way it has always been done in the Catholic school system . 	0
WD	8788	We have done our share . 	0
WD	8789	Where will that child be best prepared to succeed in college and beyond ? 	0
WD	8790	Like most certified teachers I did not hold this method of education in very high regard . 	0
WD	8791	If you wish to improve public schools the only answer is to get government out of education and turn it back to local control . 	0
WD	8792	, specifically my bias against homeschooling before doing the research . 	0
WD	8793	What is wrong with this country is public schools and people that believe that someone owes them something . 	1
WD	8794	This is not about real " choice " . 	0
WD	8795	When middle-class parents go private , they are supporting a shift that will see public schools become a residual system for the poor . 	0
WD	8796	I find it deeply offensive when parents imply that they send their kids to private schools because they care about them more . 	0
WD	8797	There ' s plenty of evidence to show that the best thing you can do for your kids is engage with them ( ie . more time at home , less time at work ) and make their home life an enriching one . 	0
WD	8798	How well a child does at school depends on the child itself not the school it goes to . 	0
WD	8799	Attitude to studies is all important . 	0
WD	8800	I send my kids to public schools because I care about them - their links with their diverse local community etc - but also because I care about the kind of culture they live in . 	0
WD	8801	To me , learning to care about and contribute to society as a whole - not just your own personal interests - is the best value a child can inherit . 	0
WD	8802	All of our kids deserve to reach their full potential , regardless of their sex . 	0
WD	8803	I have written more than a hundred articles for this column and this has never happened before . 	0
WD	8804	If a student ' s mind is occupied with sex , drugs and alcohol you can ' t expect good results . 	0
WD	8805	Set high moral standards for your child and encourage the proper attitude to study and life in general and it won ' t matter which school he / she attends . 	0
WD	8806	The next thing I know there are thousands of readers “ recommending ” my article on their Facebook pages . 	0
WD	8807	Then I did the research and found , for the most part , that they are doing a fine job and I said so . 	1
WD	8808	All of us , no matter our religious beliefs , need to pray that the law changes before more smart children are left behind . 	0
WD	8809	That has changed because of immigrants , the world just in general becoming smaller through computers , TV . , and people becoming more independent from their own study and reading . 	0
WD	8810	When I was a kid we learned religion in church , math , reading , history , etc . , in school and at home . 	0
WD	8811	What will Americans do when Arabs wear headscarves , burkas to public school as is happening in Europe ? 	0
WD	8812	Why are some people making it so difficult , demanding that religion be taught also in schools , alongside science ? 	0
WD	8813	We have some problems to face , don ' t we ? 	0
WD	8814	Notice these are only women ' s wear , which creates another gigantic problem of suppression of the female ( Americans think ) . 	0
WD	8815	The entire world has these problems , not just here in America , and we are the guineau pigs . 	0
WD	8816	Now just 38 per cent of Britons , according to a 2005 poll , believe in " a God " of any kind ( a further 40 per cent of people believe in " some sort of spirit or life force " , apparently , showing that the market for new-age waffly nonsense is still going strong ) . 	0
WD	8817	I can ' t remember the exact timeline ) homeschoolers to simply graduate . 	0
WD	8818	Why , because their parents pay for them to be there . 	0
WD	8819	After reading all the comments attached to this article I would like to address some of them : Thank you for your encouragement to homeschool my boys . 	0
WD	8820	In the end I would like to emphasise two things : 1 ) People have suggested that there are pros and cons , and yes , this is obviously true but the implication to some may be that all this ' washes out ' in the end . 	0
WD	8821	This is NOT true . 	0
WD	8822	Any decent school will have various other contacts . 	0
WD	8823	However , more importantly , a rounded upbringing includes children being involved in other extra-curricula activities that allows them all sorts of interactions with a wide variety of people . 	0
WD	8824	Science can be wrong , but by far I ' ll take science over anecdotal evidence . 	0
WD	8825	: ) Single-sex schools do not mean living in a monastry . 	0
WD	8826	Depending on who you speak to , there is also anecdotal evidence that there are significant risks in vaccination babies . 	0
WD	8827	But the science indicates that the risk is almost negligible . 	0
WD	8828	Again , do the research . 	0
WD	8829	Studies clearly establish that single-sex schools are , IN GENERAL , better for educational outcomes than co-ed schools . 	0
WD	8830	But … 	0
WD	8831	And I thought , sure , because she ' s a bright kid who ' s supposed to be in 2nd grade . 	0
WD	8832	But I didn ' t say it . 	0
WD	8833	Many who say money is a factor are simply choosing to spend their resources on other things when they could spend it on freeing up the possibility of homeschooling . 	0
WD	8834	Oooo - I had to bite my tongue to keep from saying almost the same thing , in a similar situation recentl ! . 	0
WD	8835	I have a July ' 07 girl whom I am sending to kindergarten this fall . 	0
WD	8836	I swear if I hear one more time ( and I know I will ) about how advanced her kid is . . . 	0
WD	8837	I ' m just going to say " so why not move her to 3rd grade where she belongs ? " 	0
WD	8838	It went unsaid , but the message I got was that I was not doing the right thing , by sending mine . 	0
WD	8839	Many who say they are not temperamentally suited to homeschooling are using that as a smokescreen when the truth is they are not willing to exercise the patience and submit to the sacrifice needed to homeschool . 	0
WD	8840	I got into a conversation with another mom whose child was the same age , who was holding her daughter back . 	0
WD	8841	She was actually totally cool , said she was still kind of conflicted about her decision , respected others choices , etc . It was the other women there who jumped into our conversation and assured her that she was DEFINITELY doing the right thing , who annoyed me . 	0
WD	8842	My daughter does not let the overcrowded classrooms bother her . 	0
WD	8843	To this day , I believe it may be the most prophetic series I ’ ve ever delivered at Meck . 	0
WD	8844	I do not believe homeschooling is for everyone , nor the mark of whether you are a good parent . 	0
WD	8845	The children in the public system , some , not all , are just waiting to get out at the end of the day . 	0
WD	8846	I know there can be economic barriers to homeschooling . 	0
WD	8847	Only to be more frustrated because there were about 60 kids in the tutoring session who all had questions . 	0
WD	8848	. 	0
WD	8849	At least one child died . 	0
WD	8850	Terrified students huddled in classrooms . 	0
WD	8851	They called 911 . 	0
WD	8852	They texted and tweeted . 	0
WD	8853	Teachers locked doors and implemented emergency procedures . 	0
WD	8854	And at least one teacher chased the gunman out of the school – an act of bravery that possibly saved lives . 	0
WD	8855	As police try to make sense of the senseless , the school superintendent called on people to pray . 	0
WD	8856	It was a wise decision . 	0
WD	8857	But perhaps lost in the chaos is the irony that in American public schools – people are not allowed to pray . 	0
WD	8858	Liberals have successfully banished God from the classroom , replacing Him with the manmade god of secularism . 	0
WD	8859	The kids are coddled , have no responsibility with the school system in this area . 	0
WD	8860	I think it sends the wrong message . 	0
WD	8861	It drives me nuts . 	0
WD	8862	I am in no way " Wealthy " however I chose to send my children to private school that has a religion based background . 	0
WD	8863	After all , there are very few things one can do as a grown-up , short of joining a cloistered religious order , to be exclusively in a single-sex environment . 	0
WD	8864	I can learn and do schoolwork and still have time for loads of other experiences . 	0
WD	8865	They could do this at public schools but do not . 	0
WD	8866	The public school was a joke . 	1
WD	8867	So I think your argument needs a lot more supporting facts . 	0
WD	8868	It ' s a strange hangover from a time when Britain really was a majority Christian country . 	0
WD	8869	Seems to me that you would send your child to private school if you felt you had the means . 	0
WD	8870	Children in the public school systems ARE left behind , bullied , and not challenged enough in their own learning capabilities . 	0
WD	8871	Private teachers have more passion about teaching because they are free to write their own curriculum for each child based on developmental assessments and achievements to where each child is learning at the level they need to be at and not just a class as a whole . 	0
WD	8872	The teachers do not open up a text book and teach every child the same way . 	0
WD	8873	Sending your child to a private school is one of the best things you can do for them . 	1
WD	8874	Oh , but she ’ s gifted ? 	0
WD	8875	This isn ' t the place to argue about Planned Parenthood , but the things they say to children as young as ten are things that shouldn ' t be said without a parent ' s permission . 	0
WD	8876	I went K–12 to a terrible public school . 	0
WD	8877	Well , then , she ’ ll really be fine . 	0
WD	8878	You want the best for your child , but your child doesn ’ t need it . 	0
WD	8879	I understand . 	0
WD	8880	She will have support at home ( that ’ s you ! ) and all the advantages that go along with being a person whose family can pay for and cares about superior education—the exact kind of family that can help your crappy public school become less crappy . 	0
WD	8881	Schools everywhere are failing to crack down on issues like bullying , and failing a lot of other things too . 	0
WD	8882	I ' m on the homeschool side of the debate . 	1
WD	8883	Woahhh , guys , some of this is starting to get a little attack-y . 	0
WD	8884	For the purpose of this argument , I ' m referring to homeschooling as any kind of flexible education : online schools , unschooling , a hodge-podge of curricula from different places , anything . 	0
WD	8885	That said , I don ' t believe it ' s the best in every single case . 	0
WD	8886	There wasn ’ t even soccer . 	0
WD	8887	When I asked her about it , she said , “ I think the absence of boys helped me personally because I was a shy kid , so being with all girls helped me discover myself more easily and become more outgoing without the pressure of trying to impress boys . ” 	0
WD	8888	Some of you with different political backgrounds may disagree , but this is what I believe . 	0
WD	8889	But even beyond that , I see him being very enthusiastic about learning and I want to give him as many opportunities as I can to foster that curiosity . 	0
WD	8890	This involves more than just the memorization of facts . 	0
WD	8891	Even in the story in the original post , I think mainstreaming was a good thing . 	1
WD	8892	Now that this person has graduated from high school , he might not be able to go on and get the types of college degrees that his peers are pursuing but maybe he could be placed in some sort of work program or job training program to help him be as independent as possible . 	0
WD	8893	I agree with what other posters have said . . . it depends on the individual child and how high functioning they are . 	0
WD	8894	If the being in a mainstream classroom is good for them and doesn ' t interfere with other students ability to learn then it is a good thing . 	0
WD	8895	I would NEVER put my child in a public school system if I could place them in a private . 	1
WD	8896	As far as public schools go , WOW are you sure that your child will come home to you tonight ? ? ? ? ? ? 	0
WD	8897	My husband and I ( my parents too ! ) sacrificed a lot to give him this education . 	0
WD	8898	As a parent that sent her son to private schools , I feel this is totally wrong for her to make this judgment . 	0
WD	8899	His case was brought before the U . S . Supreme Court . 	0
WD	8900	So in some cases there ' s a safety issue . 	0
WD	8901	Tina 	0
WD	8902	So , come up with a different way to make the public systems in better shape ! 	0
WD	8903	The effect of this ruling is not just to eat away at the sacredness of the name of God , but to eliminate the sacredness and thereby the substance of the oath itself . 	0
WD	8904	Mr . Morley , writing in the Nation ’ s Business September 1961 , pointed out “ the absurdity of having an official administer to others oaths in the sanctity of which he does not himself believe . ” 	0
WD	8905	In other places , it ' s what kids will hear , and I ' m not talking about peers . 	0
WD	8906	While one child may choose an excellent set of friends and role models , another child might migrate toward the trouble makers . 	0
WD	8907	If he ' d stayed in preschool , it would have been another year of being the bad kid who couldn ' t play or socialize properly . 	0
WD	8908	His confidence has improved so much being in a big kid school and being able to easily do all the work . 	0
WD	8909	He met the cutoff to start at 4yo and we sent him . 	0
WD	8910	HIPPO ODS will never be socially en par with his peers , but was reading and writing and adding by 4yo . 	0
WD	8911	Had I a daughter , I would encourage her to find single-sex schools . 	1

WD	8914	I ' m good with that . 	1
WD	8915	They do not impose significantly on the other traditions . 	0
WD	8916	Both are reasonable accommodations . 	0
WD	8917	Nobody is being influenced here - Muslim students are simply being given a place to pray . 	1
WD	8918	I see no issue here . 	0
WD	8919	Fact : Muslims pray five times daily , in a way which is not practical in a normal classroom setting . 	0
WD	8920	This is just silliness . 	0
WD	8921	For example , Jehovah ' s Witnesses commonly do not participate in the national anthem , because they only recognize the Kingdom of God . 	0
WD	8922	Fact : we make other appropriate accommodations for other faith groups . 	0
WD	8923	You will soon understand the failings of the public school system . 	0
WD	8924	The idea that I should consider a lower level of achievement for my children so that the public schools MIGHT improve is ridiculous . 	0
WD	8925	When you remove God you invite everything that is wicked to come in and destroy . 	0
WD	8926	I believe the demise of our schools are solely due in part to the removal of prayer in schools . 	1
WD	8927	Removal of prayer in schools is not a violation of the third amendmant . 	0
WD	8928	In a blog for Yahoo ! , Clayton writes that the real motivator behind downsizing special education classrooms by mainstreaming students with disabilities into general education classes is a desire to save money , not an effort to do what ’ s best for students with disabilities . 	0
WD	8929	The removal of prayer may not be the only cause of social ills , but the negative trends are certainly a symptom of the spiritual decline which is at their root . 	0
WD	8930	She always has the best advice , no matter the topic , and was so happy that I inquired about her opinion on the subject of our education . 	0
WD	8931	Overall , she was happy with the all-girls experience , thinking maybe four years would have been a little better than six , but self-discovery was her biggest gain out of the school . 	0
WD	8932	Of course , it all really depends on the person . 	0
WD	8933	I reached out to some of the girls that I have remained very close with , and their opinions differ from mine quite a bit . 	0

WD	8936	Which uniform style are YOU wearing ? 	0
WD	8937	Anyone who was anybody carried their books in a Dylan ’ s Candy Bar tote , then of course the accusations would fly about who really started the trend and who was copying whom . 	0
WD	8938	EVERYONE had the same one ! 	0
WD	8939	All-estrogen environments at that age thrive on gossip and making oneself seem holier-than-thou to at least a few girls . 	0
WD	8940	The cost for specialized services to children with disabilities far outweighs the cost of mainstreaming them into regular classrooms where they are unlikely to receive the specialized services they need , Clayton wrote . 	0
WD	8941	It ' s just embarrassing to see what the United States is becoming . 	0
WD	8942	Slate . com decided to take the helm with a piece by Allison Benedikt called “ If You Send Your Kid to Private School , You Are a Bad Person . ” 	0
WD	8943	We ’ re not even into the article and the judgements are flying . 	0
WD	8944	Or do you homeschool or unschool ? 	0
WD	8945	Regardless of what might work best for your own child and family , there is plenty of public opinion that will tell you that whatever you ’ ve decided is inherently wrong . 	0
WD	8946	Private ? 	0
WD	8947	Charter ? 	0
WD	8948	What school do you send your child to ? 	0
WD	8949	Public ? 	0
WD	8950	This week , many kids , including my own , are headed back to school . 	0
WD	8951	And , like anything parenting-related , school brings along with it its own heaping pile of judgement . 	0
WD	8952	I didn ' t know one person who did drugs at my co-ed high school , or know anyone who had access to drugs . 	0
WD	8953	The girls at my all-girls school got drugs from the boys they knew ( all outside of school , of course , as it was an all-girls school ) . 	0
WD	8954	Whereas girls who go to all-girls schools will hang out with guys from another school ( maybe their " brother " school ) , guys from the train station , the arcade . 	0
WD	8955	Surely as a parent you ' d feel more OK knowing that your daughter was with someone she knew ? 	0
WD	8956	. 	0
WD	8957	. 	0
WD	8958	They tend to be more open to hanging out with guys they ' ve just met – and not really knowing anything about them . 	0
WD	8959	you get my drift . 	0
WD	8960	And if they ' re not getting it at school , they ' ll get it elsewhere . 	0
WD	8961	Girls LIKE male attention . 	0
WD	8962	A study conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2011 said that starting kindergarten one year late " substantially reduces the probability of repeating the third grade , and meaningfully increases in tenth grade math and reading scores . 	0
WD	8963	He instills fear into people . 	0
WD	8964	All one man has to do is get people to follow him and how does he do that . 	0
WD	8965	You cannot expect to hold up class time and such and force other people of other religions to listen to Christian prayers , Jewish prayers , Hindu , Muslim whatever it is not right to force people who do not share the same feelings about religion as you to sit there and listen to you pray is insensitive to the beliefs of others . 	0
WD	8966	Church may also be a good time for that kind of stuff . 	0
WD	8967	If there was a correct religion and we knew about it then everyone would most likely be it , don ’ t you think . 	0
WD	8968	You cannot be so ignorant to say that your religion no matter what it is , is the correct religion there is no proof that it is the correct one . 	0
WD	8969	Because no one knows what the right one is . 	0
WD	8970	Why are there so many religions in the world . 	0
WD	8971	How many religions have been founded or made off the words of one man . 	0
WD	8972	Look at it this way . 	0

WD	8976	I certainly know more than 3 home educated people , non of which went off the rails , yet I could compile a huge list of children that attended school who did . 	0
WD	8977	As for social interacting , I used to go on camping trips , day trips , I would study with friends by rivers , in the woods , on the beach or just pop round to each others houses . 	0
WD	8978	It was such a positive and wonderful experience , my parents travelled far and wide to give me these experiences , for that I will always admire them ! 	0
WD	8979	For the record , my parents aren ’ t hippies , or God fearing Christians . 	0
WD	8980	Also to sate that home educating families are middle class could not be further from the truth , with four children and my father receiving a pitiful wage as a hill farmer and my mum being an unpaied housewife , they , nor I fall into the bizarre and inaccurate stereo type of a home educated family . 	0
WD	8981	To assume parents who home school are ‘ cruel ’ could not be more wrong . 	0
WD	8982	To send a distressed and terrified child to school everyday is sick ! 	0
WD	8983	As supporters of this campaign against public teachers unions , it only makes sense that the news media ignores important books such as The Public School Advantage : Why Public Schools Outperform Private Schools . 	0
WD	8984	Charter schools , vouchers for private schools , school and school district takeovers — virtually all right-wing school reform efforts attack public school teachers because they are unionized and therefore make a decent wage . 	0
WD	8985	Weakening unions is one key strategy in the thirty-year class war in which wealth has been transferred from the middle class and poor up the economic ladder to the wealthy . 	0
WD	8986	The news media will certainly give fair coverage to both sides of most labor disputes , but in feature coverage they give far greater voice to anti-union pundits , writers , politicians , theories and events than to those in support of unions . 	0
WD	8987	The news media , owned as they are by large companies , have come to share big business ’ disdain for unions , especially over the past thirty years . 	0
WD	8988	In the case of education , it ’ s just not so , but the news media filters out this important news for ideological reasons . 	0
WD	8989	One of the ideological tenets of the mass media is that the private sector always outperforms the public sector . 	0
WD	8990	Nor was I surprised that the news media has ignored the Lubienski book . 	0
WD	8991	Are private schools better or worse ? 	0
WD	8992	Should private schools be allowed to compete with public schools ? 	0
WD	8993	However , school vouchers are illegal in most states , so this solution is not available to most parents . 	0
WD	8994	The most common solution to this problem is called a school voucher , which is essentially a tax rebate for parents that they can use to pay private tuition . 	0
WD	8995	What do you think ? 	0
WD	8996	Many polls have indicated that the American public is supportive to the idea of school vouchers , but national teacher ’ s unions oppose them , and so far they have not become a mainstream alternative to public school . 	0
WD	8997	The primary obstacle to creating more private schools is cost . 	0
WD	8998	A private school can choose to create a new curriculum for auto mechanics if it wants to , and doesn ’ t need to ask the government for permission or funding . 	0
WD	8999	Many parents do not have enough money to both pay school taxes and pay for tuition at a private school . 	0
WD	9000	Right now , all citizens of the U . S . pay taxes to maintain their local schools . 	0
WD	9001	We are not number one in any single category . 	0
WD	9002	We are a second rate nation when it comes to education and while were ' at it we aren ' t exactly a shinning example of exemplary medicine either . 	0

WD	9004	Look at the world achievement rankings of our young people . 	0
WD	9005	According to a report issued by the National Center for Education Statistics in spring 2011 , the scores for kindergarten entry were higher for delayed-entry kindergartners and on-time kindergartners than for repeating kindergartners . 	0
WD	9006	We find substantial variation in practices across schools , with schools serving larger proportions of white and high-income children having far higher rates of delayed entry , " noted the report , " The Extent , Patterns , and Implications of Kindergarten ' Redshirting , ' " issued in April 2013 . 	0
WD	9007	No thanks . 	0
WD	9008	If you don ' t believe that they are as bad as I think they are , then you need only pay close attention when you ' re in a situation where young people might be talking or better yet when they are at a check out register . 	0
WD	9009	Some parents are even delaying schooling to give their children a competitive advantage in sports , or to delay admission age to college . 	0
WD	9010	Parents might think their child is not emotionally ready to leave home , or not socially or academically adept . 	0
WD	9011	" We find that between 4 and 5 . 5 percent of children delay kindergarten , a lower number than typically reported … 	0
WD	9012	A joint study by the University of Virginia and Stanford University released in 2013 established a relationship between red shirting and socio-economic status and ethnicity . 	0
WD	9013	It ' s a phenomenon known as redshirting . 	0

WD	9018	Truth be told College may not be in his future , but we will do everything in our power to try to get him there . 	0
WD	9019	It not only threatens educational freedom but also places a presumption of guilt on loving families who must prove themselves innocent to suspicious officialdom . 	0
WD	9020	From the home educators ' point of view , however , the conflating of welfare issues with education is a dangerous step . 	0

WD	9022	We tried to mainstream him in kindergarten , but he had a hard time adjusting . 	0
WD	9023	My child was in " preschool handicapped " from age 2-5 . 	0
WD	9024	lf not , it can backfire on the child . 	0
WD	9025	l think as parents of the child you have to be certain and confident that your child is ready to mainstream . 	0
WD	9026	We took him off meds and we have a strong behavior plan , he sees therapists , and it is hourly teaching and redirecting with him . 	0
WD	9027	Our goal is for him to not have a one on one by middle school . 	0
WD	9028	2 grades later , he still has a one on one aide but doing EXCELLENT . 	0
WD	9029	So the school got him a one on one para and it helped a bit . 	0
WD	9030	I ' ll be putting this view into practise when my daughter is old enough . 	0
WD	9031	Why can ' t we find a situation where he is happy AND can receive an appropriate education and related services ? 	0
WD	9032	The tragic case of Khyra Ishaq prompted Ed Balls to commission a review of home education in 2009 that was undertaken by Graham Badman . 	0
WD	9033	Thankfully , the teacher situation seems to have stabilized . 	0
WD	9034	Yet , they still seem ill-equipped to deal with behavior problems . 	0
WD	9035	The non-public school director has said repeatedly that we are welcome to take our child out of her school since she has a waiting list , whenever we have brought up concerns . 	0
WD	9036	( Our biggest concern was the revolving door that teachers were on in 2006 / 07 : 3 teachers quit in 1 year . ) 	0
WD	9037	The non-public school has a very unwelcome attitude towards parent involvement , and even to questions and concerns that parents may raise . 	0
WD	9038	The idea that child abuse can be thwarted by tightening laws about home education has been around for some time . 	0
WD	9039	It seems that Khyra ' s last hope was that the local authority ' s home education support team might intervene once her mother had withdrawn her from school . 	0
WD	9040	What does that tell ya about are public school system ? 	0
WD	9041	He reached the same conclusions as this week ' s serious case review – that the law be changed to ensure that social services speak to children to assess if home education is in their interests . 	0
WD	9042	My problem is when a parent doesn ' t put the effort in to socialize the kids , they are in too narrow of a group of friends and not allowed any friends out side of that group . 	0
WD	9043	They will take away your rights to homeschool based on the outcome of the testing , I think that ' s a good thing . 	0
WD	9044	I know in this state the kids have to pass a yearly assesment test . 	0
WD	9045	Writers have a responsibility to be unbiased . 	0
WD	9046	Public school has shortened hours and the school year in Orange County CA . 	0
WD	9047	I send my son to a Catholic School and last year I saw what they were doing . 	0
WD	9048	Far better than when I was at that grade and far better than the local public school . 	0
WD	9049	This writer is not thinking . 	0
WD	9050	We all want our children to get a good education . 	0
WD	9051	A TA once a week for a severly ADHD boy who became violent was NO GOOD . 	0
WD	9052	A TA once a week in my lessons for an sutistic boy was NO GOOD . 	0
WD	9053	In this age group ( senior high school ) , the benefits were larger and more consistent across the board for girls than for boys . 	0
WD	9054	The National Foundation for Educational Research conducted a study in which they observed and calculated of 2 , 954 high schools ( both co-ed and single-sex ) throughout England and found , " Even after controlling for students ' academic ability and other background factors , both girls and boys did significantly better in single-sex schools than in coed schools . 	0
WD	9055	It is very clear by the above chart that both sexes academically benefit from a single-sex education . 	0
WD	9056	But then we have studies that show the numbers . 	0
WD	9057	Advantages have not been demonstrated . " 	0
WD	9058	That ' s not to say that academic outcomes are definitively worse , but neither are they definitively better . 	0
WD	9059	Penn State ' s very own , psychology professor Lynn S . Liben claims there is no academic benefit to a single-sex education , " Our examination of the existing studies leads us to conclude that there is not scientific evidence for positive effects of single-sex schooling . 	0
WD	9060	So , while the single-sex atmosphere allowed young women at my school to branch out and express themselves without the restriction of the opposite sex , some may argue that it could have instilled an anxiety associated with the opposite sex . 	0
WD	9061	It ' s been proven that the per student cost basis in public schools is much higher than private schools . 	0
WD	9062	For higher-achieving boys , there was no statistically significant effect of school type on performance , positive or negative . " 	0
WD	9063	Specifically , girls at all levels of academic ability did better in single-sex schools than in coed schools ; whereas for boys , the beneficial effect of single-sex schools was significant only for boys at the lower end of the ability scale . 	0
WD	9064	Age wise I was right in the middle of my class at school and I was far ahead of my class . 	0
WD	9065	Yes , out public school system is broken , but until the PARENTS start caring and actively participating in the education of their children and stop making it solely the schools ' job , nothing is going to change . 	0
WD	9066	I remember when I went to public school and it just seemed that the teachers cared about more than their yearly raises and making sure the school got enough money each year from the government . 	0
WD	9067	However I feel that the school struggles to meet her needs due to lack of experience and always fighting for funding . 	0
WD	9068	I ran life skills groups and was always part of any meetings about trips , work experience , careers etc . I now work as a TA with a child with CP who is placed in a mainstream school appropriately so because despite physical and communication difficulties is very bright . 	0
WD	9069	Those with physical disabilitys but no additiona learning needs were fully intergrated into the class but because of the inclusive nature and an excellent senco adaptations could be made , e . g IT provision in every lesson , access to a scribe , extended time to sit exams and submit homework , leaving lessons a few minutes earlier to avoid the crush in the corridors . 	0
WD	9070	They were able to mix with their peers of all abilities at break times . 	0
WD	9071	The kids intergrated into the lessons they were able to and had lessons within the unit . 	0
WD	9072	One secondary school had a great system with a unit attached with a high ratio of TA ' s to children . 	0
WD	9073	I was a paediatric Occupational Therapist and worked in both special needs schools and mainstream environments and saw successes and failiures in both . 	0
WD	9074	I think it must be a mindfield for parents having to make this choice and despair at the battles they face for funding appropriate eductation for their children . 	0
WD	9075	I can see the benefits of both types of schooling for differnt children . 	0
WD	9076	More over , they will probably succeed in their work life no matter the school they attended . 	0
WD	9077	This is what ALL schools should aspire to be . 	0
WD	9078	There are true outliers in both directions based on personality vs when they started school . 	0
WD	9079	The single-sex education question is , at least in part , a legal one , but it is also a scientific one . 	0
WD	9080	The ACLU ’ s findings have led them to challenge the sex-segregated programs in several states and even file a lawsuit against a West Virginia program . 	0
WD	9081	As a result they were , in fact , decidedly unequal . 	0
WD	9082	Many of them relied on outdated and scientifically unfounded stereotypes of boys and girls to drive their curriculum . 	0
WD	9083	But , in the absence of high-quality research , why err on the side of segregation ? 	0
WD	9084	Perhaps if we do a better job of having the scientific conversation about whether or not single-sex education actually works we wouldn ’ t have to have the conversation about the legality . 	0
WD	9085	At the moment we simply don ’ t have sufficient evidence to say that single-sex education in the US actually works . 	0

WD	9087	I have little reason to think that one day , Ryan will wake up with a hushed demeanor . 	0
WD	9088	Hard though it may be to believe , the public school was better on these issues . 	0
WD	9089	Additionally , Ryan can have short attention span , especially if he ’ s bored . 	0
WD	9090	( Please , pass me another glass of wine ) . 	0
WD	9091	I worry some about her going off to college at age 17 , but the idea of a gap year at 17 to engage in a rewarding volunteer experience sounds better to me than an extra year spent in preschool would have been . 	0
WD	9092	( His hearing has been tested and , yes , he ’ s fine ) . 	0
WD	9093	I ’ ve often wondered – if God is good enough for the bad times , shouldn ’ t He be good enough for the good times ? 	0
WD	9094	Yet in times of great tragedy , school leaders inevitably seek guidance and solace from the same God they ’ ve expelled . 	0
WD	9095	Another issue is Ryan ’ s loudness . 	0
WD	9096	But his father is loud and so is his older sister . 	0
WD	9097	It ’ s as if he ’ s a broken volume button on an old radio , stuck on high no matter what . 	0
WD	9098	Now she ' s in 7th grade , and still at the top of her class . 	0
WD	9099	Our society has become so concentrated on how people FEEL . 	0
WD	9100	That if someone is FEELING bad and they don ’ t FEEL like going to work today then they don ’ t . 	0

WD	9106	We need a moral adjustment , not a legislative one . ) 	0
WD	9107	There are a lot of reasons why bad people send their kids to private school . 	0
WD	9108	Everyone , all in . 	0
WD	9109	( By the way : Banning private schools isn ’ t the answer . 	0
WD	9110	None of these are compelling reasons . 	0
WD	9111	Or , rather , the compelling ones ( behavioral or learning issues , wanting a not-subpar school for your child ) are exactly why we should all opt in , not out . 	0
WD	9112	Yes , some do it for prestige or out of loyalty to a long-standing family tradition or because they want their children to eventually work at Slate . 	0
WD	9113	But many others go private for religious reasons , or because their kids have behavioral or learning issues , or simply because the public school in their district is not so hot . 	0
WD	9114	I believe in public education , but my district school really isn ’ t good ! 	0
WD	9115	you might say . 	0
WD	9116	We are also far from rich . 	0

WD	9118	I didn ' t feel equipped to teach him and he got nothing from my lessons , and when he was " blowing " neither did anyone else . 	0
WD	9119	There , I said it . 	0
WD	9120	Every single solitary teacher I ' ve spoken to about this says that any differential based upon age pretty much disappears by the time the child is in 3rd grade . 	0
WD	9121	I can see it right now at the end of second grade - to the extent there were differences because she was so young are completely eliminated . 	0
WD	9122	FWIW - I think for many kids you can tell in kindergarten and first . 	0
WD	9123	But being at the tail end of this , you can ' t tell after that . 	0
WD	9124	So the question is : Why do people hold their kids out a year when the District says this is when the kids go ? 	0
WD	9125	If you really can ' t tell - why don ' t you just follow the rules ? 	0
WD	9126	You honestly cannot tell the difference in the ages of the kids . 	0
WD	9127	Every once in a while a child might stand out but it ' s not that often and the reason they are standing out is usually not because they seem " older " or " younger " I don ' t necessarily disagree with you . 	0
WD	9128	The teacher says she can ' t tell any difference at all . 	0
WD	9129	As the temporary alliance between Liz Sayce and Maria Miller proves , this can make for some very unlikely bedfellows . 	0
WD	9130	BUT teaching in a class of 35 without support was silly . 	0
WD	9131	Preparing special work for the ADHD / Autistic / severely limited children was not a problem , a joy , really , and my job ! 	0
WD	9132	No wonder students who have been divided by sex for years need help learning how to work and learn together . 	0
WD	9133	Here ’ s the bottom line : many of our schools are in trouble and coming out of the largest recession since the 1930s , with mounting national debt , we have limited resources . 	0
WD	9134	Perhaps this outcome isn ’ t surprising . 	0
WD	9135	Social scientists have found that labeling and separating students based on almost any characteristic ( e . g . , sex , eye color , randomly assigned t-shirts ) makes those differences even more salient to the students and produces intergroup bias . 	0
WD	9136	Got that ? 	0
WD	9137	Instead of focusing on techniques that have been proven to improve academic outcomes , the school has to spend its limited resources teaching boys and girls to play well with each other . 	0
WD	9138	So , the right of kids to pray in school is not only not banned , but even constitutionally protected . 	0
WD	9139	In fact , the Bill of Rights ’ First Amendment protects both the right to freedom of speech ( prayer can obviously be a form of speech ) as well as the right to free exercise of religion ( praying also obviously qualifies as exercising one ’ s religion ) . 	0
WD	9140	Kids pray all the time in school ( often right before a quiz or exam ) . 	0
WD	9141	This is nonsense . 	0
WD	9142	The dearest private schools with long heritage of generations of pupils from the one family don ' t show it theses days . . . 	0
WD	9143	Sports on Saturdays music classes drama classes etc the catholic school that ' s says 95% is reflecting their area . . 	0
WD	9144	Having previously discussed why teaching creationism in public school science classes , or posting the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms , are both inappropriate and unconstitutional , I suppose it ’ s perhaps time now to take a look at the whole heated issue of the place of prayer in U . S . public schools . 	0
WD	9145	Article failed to justify the heading lost the plot along the way . . 	0
WD	9146	However , please note that these constitutionally protected legal rights and freedoms apply only to people , and not to the government . 	0
WD	9147	And , in actual fact , no one is officially disallowing kids to pray in school whenever they want ( so long as it isn ’ t disruptive , of course — a basic school rule that equally applies to other sorts of free speech and forms of self-expression ) . 	0
WD	9148	Today , parents who homeschool don ' t even worry about high school or diplomas . 	0
WD	9149	Still , it seems that should be some oversight to prevent children from falling through the cracks . 	0
WD	9150	Both sides of this debate have a compelling case . 	0
WD	9151	And it is entirely possible that some children might receive a better education at home than they would in any of the available schools they could attend . 	0
WD	9152	Unfortunately , for parents who cannot afford private education , live in certain suburbs or who want to send their children to a public school , the selective system is the only one that will nurture and encourage them to learn and grow amongst peers who want to learn . 	0
WD	9153	Parents should not be judged for trying to do what ' s best for their children . 	0
WD	9154	I also recognize that there are deep roots to explore when we look at who is attending private versus public schools , and it certainly bears looking at why people make those choices , rather than dismissing them as not compelling enough like Benedikt does . 	0
WD	9155	Using Benedikt ’ s rational , if everyone sent their kids to public schools they would somehow magically improve . 	0
WD	9156	And due to cost , location , waiting lists , and other issues , sometimes Catholic school or another private school is not an option ( though home schooling versus Catholic schools has been a whole other debate ) . 	0
WD	9157	Out in the Western suburbs , where we can afford to live , public high schools just won ' t do unless you ' re happy for your kids to be beaten up , spat on , thrown rocks at , and depressed going to a school full of delinquents who swear at teachers & disrupt the class all day . 	0
WD	9158	How can they learn and grow in such a place , even with high involvement and support from home ? 	0
WD	9159	Don ' t need statistics , just need to put your kids into the public school system to know they ' re being disadvantaged through under resourcing and teachers ill-equipped to deal with the policies they are meant to be managing , i . e . bullying , attire , social attitude , etc . The number of parents pulling their kids from the public system speaks for itself in how the public system is operating . 	0
WD	9160	Pulling my kids out of the public system was the best thing we ever did for them ! 	1
WD	9161	An outgoing & popular bright teenager transformed into one hiding in closets to avoid school . 	0

WD	9168	However , it should be made clear that coeducation can also foster good mental and emotional situations . 	0
WD	9169	Since private schools compete with each other to gain students , they have a strong incentive to hire good teachers and offer good courses . 	0

WD	9184	At 13 I would have said that of course girls need to be bossy -- who else would lead ? 	0
WD	9185	As far as prayer in school , I think a moment of silence to allow a private prayer of any type for anyone who wishes to give such is most appropiate . 	1

WD	9187	Some of my classes were coed . 	0
WD	9188	The boys came over for European history and drama , classes where I always positioned myself in the front row , preferring the " visiting " boys sit behind me . 	0
WD	9189	To my teenage self they were clearly infringing on my territory and I made sure I outperformed them . 	0
WD	9190	That confidence translated when I went next door for Latin , where I righteously covered my tests with my arm to make sure the boy sitting behind me couldn ' t cheat off of me ( a trick he only got away with once ) . 	0
WD	9191	When I arrived at Harvard ( also Sandberg ' s alma mater ) I was never afraid to raise my hand in a seminar , and I quickly learned that the best way to be heard meant jumping into the discussion and not waiting to be recognized . 	0
WD	9192	Most institutions now accept parents ' transcripts , letters from community members , SAT scores and entrance exam scores as proof of achievement . 	0
WD	9193	Colleges and universities are now recognizing that homeschooled children ' s education is as well-rounded as that of their peers . 	0
WD	9194	In the private school system , the administration is more able to deal with the difficult student , even if that mean expelling them from the school . 	0
WD	9195	All of these situations encourage development of social and conflict-resolution skills , expect courteous and respectful behavior and expose children to diversity . 	0
WD	9196	While it is true that they may not spend six hours of every day with same-age peers , many homeschooled children are from large families , are involved in extracurricular activities and lessons , and volunteer in the community . 	0
WD	9197	Socialization One of the most common arguments against homeschooling is that children who learn at home will not have opportunities to socialize with their peers . 	0
WD	9198	Others might purchase commercial online or DVD-based curricula . 	0
WD	9199	Some may hire a tutor or belong to a cooperative where parents take turns teaching in their area of expertise . 	0
WD	9200	This may have been accurate in the past but today , even if parents do not have the required skill set , they have many options . 	0
WD	9201	Meeting Academic Standards Another argument against homeschooling is that students may not be exposed to the same rigorous curriculum standards at home as they would be at school , which would make it difficult to be accepted at postsecondary institutions . 	0

WD	9224	As private individuals , kids today remain as free to pray in their schools as they have ever been ; in fact , their right to do so is constitutionally protected . 	0

WD	9227	Those who can afford to bail on trying to improve the system and end up sending their children to private school rather than work on improving public ones . 	0
WD	9228	It ’ s just that it has been widely recognized that it is clearly unconstitutional for the state ( and , by extension , state schools ) to officially sanction , sponsor , offer , or conduct prayers . 	0

WD	9235	And that ' s what scares these selfish people that want to take away people ' s freedom and start calling people names just because they are envious of what others have or do ! 	0
WD	9236	After all , the public school systems get tax money from everyone , even from the one ' s who send their kids to private schools . 	0
WD	9237	And the public school doesn ' t provide anything for those kids , but the system still takes their money . 	0
WD	9238	I have three children with kid ' s of the their own , one moved to be able to send his kids to a private school , the other home school ' s her children , while my other children still go to a public school . . . . but they ' re father is a teacher . . . . thank God ! ! 	0

WD	9274	I retired because I could no longer stand seeing children who desperately wanted to learn being thwarted by disruptive hoodlums . 	0
WD	9275	Additionally , private schools are not encumbered by national teacher ’ s unions or political correctness . 	0
WD	9276	Private schools that compete with each other for students will be forced to find the best teachers available , and will be able to offer flexibility that meets each individual ’ s educational needs . 	0
WD	9277	OTOH , one does read and hear about people who withdraw children from school because they have some dispute with the school about discipline ( school tries to , parents object ) or because the school has failed to address bullying concerns . 	0

WD	9297	Not bad like murderer bad—but bad like ruining-one-of-our-nation ’ s-most-essential-institutions-in-order-to-get-what ’ s-best-for-your-kid bad . 	0
WD	9298	You are a bad person if you send your children to private school . 	1
WD	9299	Your children and grandchildren might get mediocre educations in the meantime , but it will be worth it , for the eventual common good . 	0
WD	9300	It could take generations . 	0
WD	9301	This would not happen immediately . 	0
WD	9302	But it seems to me that if every single parent sent every single child to public school , public schools would improve . 	0
WD	9303	The report that an increasing number of parents in this country are seeking to homeschool their children is not at all surprising . 	0
WD	9304	However , some persons expressed confusion about this admission from an official of the Ministry of Education recently , because of the high standard of education we afford our children at the nursery , primary and secondary levels . 	0
WD	9305	But rich people will always find a way to game the system : That shouldn ’ t be an argument against an all-in approach to public education any more than it is a case against single-payer health care . ) 	0
WD	9306	( Yes , rich people might cluster . 	0
WD	9307	The media coverage here and abroad about bullying , teasing as well as physical and emotional abuse in public schools is abundant , and it could make a parent want to protect their children from that bad environment . 	0
WD	9308	Certainly there are advantages and disadvantages to homeschooling and if it is an area that is gaining currency in this country , the relevant authorities will need to do some probing to ensure that parents are giving their children instruction in the right manner , and are not in fact putting their children at a disadvantage . 	0
WD	9309	Unless there are individual circumstances I wouldn ' t be sending my children to a single sex school . 	1
WD	9310	Indeed , if homeschooling is really on the rise , Government may have to seek parliamentary approval to institute laws and regulations to govern this method of teaching . 	0
WD	9311	Yet most slum dwellers would much prefer their governments to open schools . 	0
WD	9312	Low-cost private schools thrive in very particular contexts ; for example , they flourish in illegal slum settlements in marginal urban areas , where governments fail to provide public schools because they do not recognise the settlements . 	0
WD	9313	Simple analysis shows that this is the result of the government failing to invest in education . 	0
WD	9314	Low-cost private schools are also evident in other contexts : for example , where government services are largely absent , such as in rural Pakistan . 	0
WD	9315	In doing this , the DFID is following in the ideological footsteps of the World Bank . 	0
WD	9316	Over the past three years , the Department for International Development ( DFID ) has made the controversial move to support low-cost private schools in some countries , such as Nigeria , Ghana , or Pakistan , where public education systems are in desperate need of investment . 	0
WD	9317	This begs the question of whether or not is it a good use of public money from UK taxpayers to invest speculatively in for-profit private schools in poor countries ? 	0
WD	9318	Indeed , a recent DFID Guidance Note on low-cost private schools argues that such schools have a key role to play in expanding education provision , despite acknowledging the fact that “ there is still a lack of data and comparative analysis on education outcomes to assess value for money ” . 	0
WD	9319	I support public school with my taxes and do help the public schools by lowering their class size with one less child . 	0
WD	9320	It certainly is not surprising , therefore , that Christian parents and those who have strong belief systems choose to homeschool their children instead of their developing questionable values in the public school system . 	0
WD	9321	I want my child to have a education that supports my religious beliefs and reinforces what I teach at home . 	0
WD	9322	In this context DFID ought to be making the case for increased domestic investment , as it is the only sustainable solution . 	0
WD	9323	Pakistan spends only 2 . 4% of its gross domestic product ( GDP ) on education against a benchmark of good practice of 6% of GDP . 	0
WD	9324	Then , in first grade , we asked he be placed in inclusive classrooms for non-academic subjects with an aide . 	0
WD	9325	He made academic gains and seemed very happy . 	0
WD	9326	The first year was great . 	0
WD	9327	So he ended up in a segregated , structured special ed . classroom . 	0
WD	9328	We didn ' t know the questions to ask , period . 	0
WD	9329	First of all , we didn ' t know he had a right to inclusion . 	0
WD	9330	In real life , it hasn ' t worked so well for my son . 	0
WD	9331	In theory , I absolutely support inclusion . 	0
WD	9332	What a hypocritical message we send to our children when we allow laws to be passed which limit the free expression of speech in public by banning public prayer in classrooms . 	0
WD	9333	Federal and Supreme Court judges should be impeached who undermine the freedom upon which this country was founded . 	0
WD	9334	He didn ' t have any friends among the peers without disabilities . 	0
WD	9335	By the second semester , it became apparent he was slipping behind academically in his special ed . classes . 	0
WD	9336	But that ' s a whole bag opened : why do some parents not care ? 	0
WD	9337	—but there is always going to be bullying . 	0
WD	9338	On the other hand , some parents were fabulous , agreeing to hand me the leads to the X-Box until I decided the work had improved , or calling on my phone in my lesson to check up . 	0
WD	9339	That , not race , is the difference . 	0
WD	9340	It ' s not something I expect to improve under this government , which has already basically written off a whole sector of society as not worth it . 	0
WD	9341	the fact that they feel comfortable enough telling me is testament to this fact . 	0
WD	9342	It ’ s a lesson I sadly suspect our nation ’ s educators will never learn . 	0
WD	9343	—The boys forget how to act around women and go cuckoo bananas when they go on a field trip together —many girls complain about it ; however , many others have told me that they like it because they are insecure about " being bad readers " and feel more comfortable in an all-girls environment . 	0
WD	9344	The fervency with which school prayer is opposed is not because the ACLU ( an anti-Christian legal group ) is trying to protect atheist from being indoctrinated by religion . 	0
WD	9345	I teach single sex classes to 7th and 8th grade students IN the Bronx similar to in the article and here is what I ' ve found . 	0
WD	9346	Humanism assumes that the supernatural does not exist and that reality must be discovered purely from man ' s reasoning . 	0
WD	9347	Our public school system has been operating on this foundation since prayer was removed in 1962 . 	0
WD	9348	Since prayer was eliminated from public schools , the quality of education has shown a steady statistical decline . 	0
WD	9349	Is there a link between the two ? 	0
WD	9350	It tells students that they are more than just a collection of chemicals and energy that happen to be occupying space and time . 	0
WD	9351	Returning prayer to school would be an affront to this philosophy because prayer acknowledges the existence of someone greater than man . 	0
WD	9352	Allowing prayer in school sets an important standard . 	0
WD	9353	As much as I hate a lot of things that happen in public education , give me that stupidity over the utter lunacy of teaching kids about invisible father figures in the sky . 	0
WD	9354	Of course , then they could learn about the earth being flat and that big flood too . 	0
WD	9355	You mean when most children weren ' t educated at all , they just worked on their parent ' s farm and a large percentage never learned to read or write ? 	0
WD	9356	Let ' s face facts , if we did away with public education , most private schools are religious these days , that ' s where people would have to turn . 	0
WD	9357	I know that there are plenty of homeschoolers who turn out just fine . . . but I ' ve never met them in reality . 	0
WD	9358	Again , I do apologize if anyone finds this offensive in any way . 	0
WD	9359	Because I was never allowed to socialize with them as a child . 	0
WD	9360	Why ? 	0
WD	9361	One was the youngest in his class . 	0
WD	9362	By the way I taught in the public schools for over twenty-five tears . 	0
WD	9363	Academically he did great , valedictorian when he graduated . 	0
WD	9364	coed OR single sex is not going to change any of that because 13 year old girls are the devil —you spend an inordinate time talking about medal of honor / twilight 	0
WD	9365	I held him back because he couldn ' t sit still . for 2 minutes . 	0
WD	9366	The other is the 2nd oldest in his class . 	0
WD	9367	After thousands of bedtime stories and hundreds of trips to the library , books were only as good as the pictures . 	0
WD	9368	In fact , The National Home Education Research Institute ( NHERI ) reports that homeschoolers actually participate in approximately five different social activities outside the home on a regular basis : boy / girl scouts , dance , swimming lessons , Sunday School , 4-H , homeschool co-ops , sports , theater , music classes and field trips . 	0
WD	9369	Honestly ? 	0
WD	9370	I do however think that one of the biggest pros to homeschooling though ( for those who do it properly and not take advantage of the way the system works ) is that kids can learn at their own pace w / o having to slow down or speed up to suit another child in their class . 	0
WD	9371	More students attending public school doesn ’ t automatically mean more involved parents either . 	0
WD	9372	How would you feel about you 6th grade daughter being in the classroom with a 17 year old predator ? 	0
WD	9373	I went to both , public and private . 	0
WD	9374	The essential difference were the students . 	0
WD	9375	And it makes all the difference . 	0
WD	9376	How would you feel about your child having to endure being bullied and taunted daily and when he reports it to the teacher nothing is done to the bully but your kid gets the snot beaten out of him ? 	0
WD	9377	I wholeheartedly support public education and in fact , our plans include sending our son to public middle and high school . 	1
WD	9378	Or … they ’ d be overcrowded . 	0
WD	9379	The way the current system works , schools in lower-class neighborhoods are overcrowded and underfunded , while schools in wealthier districts enjoy the benefits of higher taxes — and yet , even many of them are also underfunded . 	0
WD	9380	I wish we had a better way to fund schools then based on property lines and tax dollars . 	0
WD	9381	Benedikt , in her push to help promote public education , seems to think that the best way to fix the public school system is to shame parents into sending all the kids there . 	0
WD	9382	And when you complain you will be told that there are procedures that must be followed . 	0
WD	9383	The current formula for funding public schools doesn ’ t automatically mean a bunch more money per school for each new student who enrolls . 	0
WD	9384	Overcrowding public schools isn ’ t going to solve anything . 	0
WD	9385	Every school function I went to most all the parents couldn ' t speak English and the kids would act like they was a little gang member or something . 	0
WD	9386	So , the data about the high percentage of the home-schooling students that graduate and that attended top universities such Harvard , Stanford , Yale , etc . is based on those students I saw in that award ceremony . 	0
WD	9387	No more will she ever go to a public school again . 	1
WD	9388	My children went to Catholic School so they could receive a religious education , attend mass daily , be safe , and learn . 	0
WD	9389	And she always said the Mexican kids was really mean to her . 	0
WD	9390	In public school she was the only Caucasian kid in her class in third grade . 	0
WD	9391	This will be her second year . 	0
WD	9392	Their teaching methods , no matter how hard I tried to understand , just did not work for me . 	0
WD	9393	As a disabled person with an interest in politics , the conversation sometimes turns to education . 	0
WD	9394	I have a right as an American to send my children to private school and by the way we are not rich by ant means . 	0
WD	9395	The media often frame the argument as one of “ integration ” and “ segregation ” . 	0
WD	9396	However , I personally feel that this is a gross oversimplification which sometimes leads those who proclaim to be allies of the disabled down risky paths . 	0
WD	9397	This was made clear to me last year when disabled charities advocated the closure of the Remploy factories on similar grounds . 	0
WD	9398	I tried SO hard to understand , I didn ’ t want to be ‘ behind ’ the other kids , but it was no good . 	0
WD	9399	Not having it . . . . . . So you can judge and tell me I ' m wrong , but my kid is making way better grades then she was when she was in public schools . 	0
WD	9400	This week , examiner . com is having a promo called , “ The Great Debate : to homeschool or not . ” 	0
WD	9401	Why are public educators and superintendents concerned about the growing number of parents who are homeschooling their kids ? 	0
WD	9402	No matter how hard I tried it was not good enough . 	0
WD	9403	Public schools are help hostage by state and federal govenments . 	0
WD	9404	I was home educated from aged 10 onwards ; my parents were the most fantastic , enthusiastic teachers . 	0
WD	9405	Despite the best efforts of teachers and administrators they have no control over curriculum , what happens in the classroom , discipline , or anything else . 	0
WD	9406	Public schools are not influenced by parents , that ' s hooey . 	0
WD	9407	My personal experience of mainstream school was damaging . 	0
WD	9408	My parents didn ’ t take me out of school to ‘ protect me from the world ’ , good grief what a stupid thing to do ! 	0
WD	9409	I wrote this paragraph on a prior commentary because it is a fallacy that a great percentage of the home-schooling students attended top universities : I disagree that all the public schools in Maryland are bad . 	1
WD	9410	The most obvious reason is that with fewer students enrolling in public school , there will be lesser funds going into the system . 	0
WD	9411	Also remember that there ’ s more to education than what ’ s taught . 	0
WD	9412	Being Jewish , nun wasn ’ t really an option . 	0
WD	9413	Thanks in part to Sandberg and her Facebook team , I know that many of the girls I attended middle and high school with have made a variety of different choices as women : some are married , many have children , and some are stay-at-home moms while others are doctors or lawyers ( one even premiered at the Metropolitan Opera this month , while still nursing her five-month-old son ) . 	0
WD	9414	But we can know how people assess their experiences -- like me and my former classmates . 	0
WD	9415	This knowledge and the confidence that comes with it can ' t be discounted . 	0
WD	9416	I wasn ’ t going to an all-women ’ s college , and how many jobs are there where there are strictly women in the workplace ? 	0
WD	9417	Other studies have acknowledged that all-girls ' education doesn ' t necessarily improve academic performance , but they haven ' t found that it hurts either . 	0
WD	9418	Short of being able to do twin experiments ( where one identical twin goes to a coed school and the other goes to a single-sex school ) , we may never know the precise effect of what learning in a single-sex environment does for girls . 	0
WD	9419	A well-publicized 2011 Science paper disagreed , proclaiming that single-sex education can have a long-term negative effect by promoting gender stereotypes . 	0
WD	9420	And while we ' re at it , ladies , it ' s also worth remembering that shaving your legs every day isn ' t a necessity -- and not doing so leaves more time for all kinds of leaning in . 	0
WD	9421	Of course not . 	0
WD	9422	In fact it ’ s part of the reason I feel so strongly about public schools . 	0
WD	9423	Give me a break ! 	0
WD	9424	His argument was that because girls are more structured and academically oriented than boys that more girls in the classroom would give the boys more “ positive school behavior ” to model . 	0
WD	9425	In study conducted by Mieke Van Houte ( 2004 ) he examined whether or not the presence of girls affected the achievement and behavior of boys . 	0
WD	9426	Boys take a more laid-back approach , work less hard , and are distracted more quickly . 	0
WD	9427	“ In general it is stated that girls spend more time doing homework , display less disturbing behaviour in the classroom and play truant less often . 	0
WD	9428	I believe the far more important thing to consider in the single-sex vs . coeducational debate is whether or not the attitudes and emotions of the children involved are adversely or positively affected . 	0
WD	9429	It has been noted in the previous sections that single-sex education can provide a more structured learning environment for both boys and girls . 	0
WD	9430	So maybe the debate really has no footing at all , maybe it is just inherent that boys do not like school as much as girls ? 	0
WD	9431	“ Recently , various studies have demonstrated that boys are less motivated than girls and hold less positive attitudes towards school than girls ( Van Houte , 2004 ) . ” 	0
WD	9432	In another study conducted by Salomone ( 2006 ) she states “ There is some indication that single-sex classes may develop greater self-confidence and broader interests especially among adolescents … . girls report that they feel more comfortable … interact more with teachers … and develop more favorable attitudes towards these subjects ( math and science ) . ” 	0
WD	9433	( Van Houte , 2004 ) ” The study found that indeed the more girls that are in the classroom , the better the boys perform ( Van Houte , 2004 ) , it also found out that it is not so much the mere presence of girls as it is the proportion of girls . 	0
WD	9434	Some children , depending on disposition , may enjoy a single sex school more as they may not make friends from the other sex easily , and being solely around children of their own sex could develop their self-confidence . 	0
WD	9435	Advantages to sending your child to a single sex school include : children will be encouraged to learn how to interact with the other sex , despite not being able to interact every day . 	1
WD	9436	They are also exposed to how different the opposite sex can be , and how to cope with situations that come with being in a co-ed school . 	0
WD	9437	Children are able to interact daily with those from the opposite sex , allowing them to develop their social skills and have a variety of friendships . 	0
WD	9438	Let ’ s look at the advantages to sending your child to a co-ed school . 	1
WD	9439	Since each child is different , there is no specific formula to decide on a school . 	0
WD	9440	Since , the ultimate decision lies with the parents , focus needs to be on how the child would respond to either type of school , based on their personality , interests and general likes and dislikes . 	0
WD	9441	Parents often debate this issue , with many having issues with both co-ed and single sex schools . 	0
WD	9442	The author completely misses the reason why I send my children to private school as well as how to help the education system as a whole . 	0
WD	9443	Being aware of your child ’ s personality is crucial in determining which school you should choose , regardless of whether its co-ed or single sex , since a school ’ s academics , sports and cultural activities are vital issues . 	0
WD	9444	I couldn ' t come up with a more illogical argument . 	0
WD	9445	Parents of private school kids know absolutely nothing would change in the few years their children would attend a public school , even if they voiced their concerns . 	0
WD	9446	So , why waste valuable development years in a childs life when a parent could enroll their child in a private school and give them a better education immediately ? 	0
WD	9447	Seriously , do you think the same teachers who continually go on strike for better wages and less demanding grading scales would listen to parents and actually incorporate suggested changes into their classrooms ? 	0
WD	9448	Unfortunately that has me paying for my children to attend private school , and me paying for BOTH types of education . 	0
WD	9449	A 2009 study by professors at UCLA ' s Graduate School of Education & Information Studies presented data that graduates of all-girls ' schools show stronger academic orientations , especially in math and computer skills , and higher standardized tests scores , than their coed counterparts . 	0
WD	9450	But there was actually a gross violation of the third commandment by the U . S . Supreme Court a year earlier . 	0
WD	9451	When asking friends about whether they preferred public or private schooling for their children I got varied responses : some moved to be near a good public school , others sent their children to private schools because they wanted better discipline and to give them a social and professional head-start for when they left school , and one had tried both and saw pros and cons in each system . 	0
WD	9452	Then there are the fees for education . 	0
WD	9453	On the other hand , when your child excels in a particular area , such as music , languages or sports , or you want your child to have a spiritual education , it might be worth considering schools that have a curriculum focusing on those subjects . 	0
WD	9454	Most of those are private . 	0
WD	9455	Debate constantly rages about public funding of private schools , regardless of the school ’ s wealth raised from fees and donations . 	0
WD	9456	Money will definitely be an issue for us to consider when it comes to deciding which school our sons will attend . 	0
WD	9457	Public schooling is by-and-large free , with voluntary annual fees at around several hundred dollars . 	0
WD	9458	Private schooling costs thousands of dollars . 	0
WD	9459	When all the evidence for public and private schooling is boiled down , I think the most important factors are sending your children to a school where they are safe , secure and will receive a good education from high calibre teachers . 	0
WD	9460	There are schools in both the public and private systems where these factors are paramount , so it is up to us as parents to find the school that ticks as many of our boxes as possible . 	0
WD	9461	Not to mention do you really think anyone wants to pay taxes for the public system and pay huge $ for the private education . 	0
WD	9462	It ' s just like everything else the government has involvement with , failure ! ! 	0
WD	9463	He began to start not caring about school itself , he was very bored . 	0
WD	9464	I ended up pulling him out in 5th Grade into to private education through High School . 	0
WD	9465	I had several issues with the public education system not being able to keep up with my son who happened to be 3 grades ahead of his age level . 	0
WD	9466	Many conversations with the Principal and teachers . 	0
WD	9467	I made 7 . 50 / hr and was able to get an income based grant through the school . 	0
WD	9468	It was the best investment I had made . 	0
WD	9469	Or recite over and over " there is no God ? " 	0
WD	9470	And so , some may argue that single-sex education promotes gender-issued stereotypes . 	0
WD	9471	After just two weeks , the researchers reported that children who had the teacher using sex-specific language played less with children of the other sex . " 	0
WD	9472	My proposed solution would be to create co-ed , public schools that separate the sexes for the subjects of math and science ( debatably the two hardest , most demanding subjects taught in high school and the subjects that evoke the stereotype threat ) and create co-ed environments for all the other subjects . 	0
WD	9473	At the end of the day is it up to the parents : sacrifice your child ' s appreciation and cooperation with the opposite sex for a more specialized , concentrated academic environment ? 	0
WD	9474	This utopian schooling system would essentially provide the best of both worlds . 	0
WD	9475	Then , teachers could focus on targeting the needs for each sex when it comes to math and science , and incorporate both males and females for all other aspects of high school life . 	0
WD	9476	As a former educator , I believe that every child deserves equal access to education in the least restrictive environment possible . 	0
WD	9477	Private schools succeed where public schools fail largely because in a public school the teacher ' s hands are tied by politically correct nonsense . 	1
WD	9478	These hardly constitute the totality of private schools in this country . 	0
WD	9479	So before drawing any definitive conclusions , we need to know how other private schools compare . 	0
WD	9480	Perhaps a study by Luis Benveniste , Martin Carnoy and Richard Rothstein provides an answer . 	0
WD	9481	They concluded that " the social , cultural , and economic backgrounds of the parents and the community in which the school was located seemed to be the main determinant of variation , much more so than a school ' s public or private character or , within the latter group , whether it was religious or secular " ( All Else Equal , RoutledgeFalmer , 2003 ) . 	0
WD	9482	In short , they operate entirely differently . 	0
WD	9483	Therefore , I ' ll go a step farther . 	0
WD	9484	Even when socioeconomic factors are controlled , I don ' t think it ' s fair to compare private schools with public schools . 	0
WD	9485	I also hasten to note that most of the schools in the Lubienskis ' study were religious schools . 	0
WD	9486	We live in between two very highly-regarded public schools , and he will probably attend the local primary school as it is walking distance from our house and many of his friends from day care will be going there too . 	0
WD	9487	AND , then other schools down the line , like The Freshman Academy , are forced to spend their limited resources undoing the damage done by single-sex classes rather than , again , implementing proven techniques to expand academic achievement . 	0
WD	9488	I wasn ' t equipped to deal with a lad with lowered learning and physical disabilities that meant he " broke " really easily either , and seeing him fitting and falling from the chair in my lesson easily rates as one of the scariest moments of my life , until the support got there . 	0
WD	9489	Where does that child get the best education ? 	0
WD	9490	What matters is what is best for that child ' s personality ? 	0
WD	9491	In all honesty , it does not matter which avenue of education grants the best socialization . 	0
WD	9492	You don ' t sit next to them everyday , so you make time to spend with them no matter where they live . 	0
WD	9493	Deep connections are encouraged because you must go out of your way to see your friends . 	0
WD	9494	Some families homeschool year round , taking a month off between semesters to visit family and friends who live out of state . 	0
WD	9495	The opportunities to socialize quite likely outnumber those of public school because of the flexible time schedules . 	0
WD	9496	There is football , cheerleading , sign language , music , etc . There are field trips , playdates , study groups , Bible studies , conferences ( for all ages , not just the parents ) , and the list goes on . 	0
WD	9497	You know the rules , so if you take a job that makes you an agent of government , you need to respect the Constitution . 	0
WD	9498	Carry your Bible and pray if you want , but do it privately . 	1
WD	9499	I would have thought that a Christian would respect the rights of others , especially the rights of children . 	0
WD	9500	The teach in a private school or don ' t teach . 	0
WD	9501	All this time I thought it was God who was supposed to be worshiped . 	0
WD	9502	Not so with Bible thumping literalists . 	0
WD	9503	But much of it is mythology . 	0
WD	9504	Then you can continue to worship your silly book . 	0
WD	9505	Talk to your child about the routine in kindergarten and give him or her a schedule using pictures or words , depending on your child ’ s reading level . 	0
WD	9506	Ask the teacher if you can take photos of the room . 	0
WD	9507	” See if you can meet the teacher before September . 	0
WD	9508	And there are many ways ( beyond the myriad children ’ s books on the subject ) to help prepare your child . 	0
WD	9509	He was fine , and somehow thrived . 	0
WD	9510	I sobbed when I dropped our son off on his first day—not delicate weeping , but chest-heaving sobs . 	0
WD	9511	As with so many things in parenting , you can only be so prepared . 	0
WD	9512	The more your child and you know , the more comfortable everyone will be when starting this new chapter . ” 	0
WD	9513	only God himself can turn this world around and i believe He is tired of all the corruption caused by man . 	0
WD	9514	He is soon to return so we all need to be ready when He comes . 	0
WD	9515	hi . i am a 35year old lady who would love to see prayer back in the schools . 	1
WD	9516	i am writing a paper for my college writing class about the situation . 	0
WD	9517	invite the Lord in and watch the transformation . 	0
WD	9518	prayer should be done openly and privately . 	0
WD	9519	please lets get prayer back in the schools to eliminate all the violence . 	1
WD	9520	I mean why not ? 	0
WD	9521	I have a great solution to this problem - 3 day weekends anyone ? 	0
WD	9522	In Canada , no Christian would ever have to choose between going to Sunday service , and going to school . 	0
WD	9523	I didn ' t . 	0
WD	9524	Did you know that schools are still legally required to make children perform acts of Christian worship in schools ? 	0
WD	9525	Which is why it came as something of a shock to read today that " the vast majority of schools are flouting the law by failing to stage a daily Christian assembly " . 	0
WD	9526	I had no idea . 	0
WD	9527	Parents can opt their kids out , but the children themselves have no say in the matter . 	0
WD	9528	Apparently , under the 1944 Education Act , it is required that schools provide “ broadly Christian worship ” every schoolday . 	0
WD	9529	I vaguely remember some at primary school , but that was a CofE-run establishment so it ' s hardly surprising . 	0
WD	9530	I was surprised to learn that , because when I was at secondary school – a reasonably ordinary comprehensive in Oxford – there was , to my memory , not a single prayer assembly in the five years I was there . 	0
WD	9531	Assuming my experience was at least vaguely representative of the nation ' s , this is hardly a new situation . 	0
WD	9532	I left school a dozen years ago . 	0
WD	9533	Jewish prayer in schools is not a problem , because their Holy day is Saturday , also a day when there is no school . 	0
WD	9534	I don ' t know . 	0
WD	9535	It ' s certainly better than letting religion brainwash your children , which seems to be the other alternative . 	0
WD	9536	Christians , this is not a time to bring up the ‘ if prayer should be in schools ’ debate , because it ’ s a worthless cause . 	0
WD	9537	Instead , let ’ s teach people what it means to pray , even if that means not being seen at all . 	0
WD	9538	You don ’ t need to have your prayer mandated by schools or government , but you also don ’ t need to draw attention to yourself while praying . 	0
WD	9539	Done ! 	0
WD	9540	Prayer that doesn ’ t change the one praying isn ’ t prayer either . 	0
WD	9541	When prayer left the schools it reminded the church that prayer is the Christian ’ s responsibility and not the governments . 	0
WD	9542	It made parents , Sunday school teachers and pastors teach the students what prayer really was , and it is a lot different than some recited sentences once a day or scenes in the smoking section . 	0
WD	9543	It made us rethink what prayer should look like , and rethink what Jesus meant when he said prayer shouldn ’ t be on the street corners making scenes but in our rooms in private . 	0
WD	9544	" The student will develop a persona that they are always bigger , better , and have the upper hand , which might be challenging in their future , " she said . 	0
WD	9545	This is a large developmental gap when trying to get through the state standard curricula , " said Vela . 	0
WD	9546	There are mixed results on whether redshirting is helpful for the child in the long run . 	0
WD	9547	" Even though most school districts want the child to be at least at the age of five , the cut-off date for joining differs according to school district and state , " said Vela . 	0
WD	9548	Effects are highest for low income students and males . " 	0
WD	9549	Redshirting poses challenges not only to children but to teachers and parents . 	0
WD	9550	Alternately , estimates suggest that entering kindergarten early may also have detrimental effect on future outcomes . 	0
WD	9551	They are dealing with children of ages ranging between four and a half and six and a half . 	0
WD	9552	" The teacher is mostly impacted by it . 	0
WD	9553	The philosophy involves bringing support services to the child within the classroom instead of taking the student to the services , and stipulates only that the child will benefit from being in the classroom . 	0
WD	9554	The Special Education Advisor blog defines mainstreaming as “ selective placement of special education students in one or more ‘ regular ’ education classes . ” 	0
WD	9555	You know who else wants those things ? 	0
WD	9556	Philosophies and policies for carrying out the law vary , though . 	0
WD	9557	The override has been cut down the past two attempts but they ' re urging citizens to vote yes . . . . even though they just approved $150 , 000 for the purchase of additional visitor bleachers at our local high school football field . 	0
WD	9558	Inclusion , the philosophy Adelman prefers , is defined by SEA as “ the commitment to educate each child , to the maximum extent appropriate , in the school and classroom he or she would otherwise attend . ” 	0
WD	9559	The law requires that children with disabilities be educated with children who are not disabled to the extent that is appropriate . 	0
WD	9560	As Edmund Burke , correctly noted in 1795 , " All it takes for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing . " 	0
WD	9561	Whenever the opportunity arises to support the public acknowledgement of God by prayer ( or any other means ) , it benefits all of society to take a vocal stand . 	0
WD	9562	As with all truths , this is still applicable today . 	0
WD	9563	Our nation was founded on the freedom to publicly acknowledge God ' s existence . 	0
WD	9564	The situation has become so absurd that congressional prayers cannot be voluntarily read in a school building . 	0
WD	9565	Our experiment with replacing affirmation of God ' s existence with atheistic humanism has been a dismal failure . 	0
WD	9566	Allowing prayer in schools will improve , not detract from a student ' s understanding of the universe . 	0
WD	9567	It is hard to find out things that are good about co-ed schools and bad things about single sex schools 	0
WD	9568	That is why I am doing this , because of one of my classes . 	0
WD	9569	Single sex schools are not good because they do not give you the same oppertunity to us as a co-ed schools do . . . you shoulkd post some things for debate teams . 	1
WD	9570	I think sometimes we are just unrealistic . 	0
WD	9571	They can mainstream them in sports and electives for socialization . 	0
WD	9572	Guess what , they are ridiculed and picked on and continuie to act out cause they thin the other students are laughing " with them " . 	0
WD	9573	Also , sometimes ability and IQ are not the issue , social and bahavior are . 	0
WD	9574	If not , they need to be tracked in a class that tailors to thier needs . 	0
WD	9575	If a student can show in increased performance in a higher level mainstream class even with resource , great . 	0
WD	9576	Really , I think we need to actually offer individualized education . 	0
WD	9577	And I also see the government abuse for both sides of the spectrum . 	0
WD	9578	If you want you children to get a good education , private is the only way to do it ! 	1
WD	9579	That is up to government officials to start listening to the public and making the right changes . 	0
WD	9580	And no I don ' t feel guilty when I vote no on tax increases for their budget . 	0
WD	9581	The child would then be free to pursue other valuable activities such as art , playing etc . If done by parents with the right mindset , education levels and resources , I cannot see the problem . 	0
WD	9582	Although IDEA became law more than two decades ago , its implementation remains spotty . 	0
WD	9583	The government , teachers unions and political correctness has killed them . 	0
WD	9584	He points out that , “ the World Court , for example , presumably the new fountain of justice , or a prototype of the socialist dream of world government , has no provision for ’ taking the name of God ’ – no oath . ” 	0
WD	9585	I feel quite strongly that these students deserve education and mixing with others , but mainstream is not the way . 	1
WD	9586	Correction . . . worked hard and made sacrifices to afford PRIVATE school . 	0
WD	9587	The people who are demanding " Tolerance " are the biggest hypocrites of them all . 	0
WD	9588	All of this is avoided at most private schools . 	0
WD	9589	That is what is wrong . 	0
WD	9590	They have a Gay Straight Alliance club , but if someone were to form a Straight Straight Alliance club they would be demonized and labeled as " intolerant " which is complete BS . 	0
WD	9591	Final lesson ? 	0
WD	9592	You ’ ll always be judged for pretty much any parenting decision , so figure out what works best for your family and go with it . 	0
WD	9593	Benedikt ’ s argument stands on shaky legs and seems fueled solely by judgement ( which she admits ) rather than exploring actual , attainable solutions for improving the public school system . 	0
WD	9594	But , this seems par for the course when it comes to the “ Mommy Wars ” : Instead of focusing on real solutions and changes in harmful infrastructure , judgement is tossed about like it will bring magical results ( beyond anger and defensiveness ) in its wake . 	0
WD	9595	I have been advised to put my money in private schools , or else save it for attorneys later . 	0
WD	9596	Yes , there were some quite handsome ones that my eye would wander to in class , but not enough to distract me from my work , have me expelled for poor grades and end up a delinquent on the street . 	0
WD	9597	Once I switched schools , I found myself with valuable – and what I ’ m sure to be life long – friendships with the boys I sat with in class . 	0
WD	9598	The shock of all of a sudden being in a class with boys upon entering college must be just as scary as leaving home on the collegiate journey ! 	0
WD	9599	How can that be successfully done when you are singularly interacting with only girls in an educational environment ? 	0
WD	9600	I really felt if I had stayed , I would have been unprepared for life after high school , socially speaking . 	0
WD	9601	Well , smart child , smart decisions = successful in a co-ed school ! 	0
WD	9602	Isn ’ t that the fear of parents ? 	0
WD	9603	And look at that , not pregnant ! 	0
WD	9604	What struck me throughout her school years was her total confidence as she went through school . 	0
WD	9605	She always felt she could succeed and did . 	0
WD	9606	We always did a lot of reading and exploring the world we live in , so keeping her mind busy wasn ' t a problem . 	0
WD	9607	She is now a lawyer , who graduated in 2011 , president of the law school bar association , hired right out of school and doing very well . 	0
WD	9608	We kept our middle child back one year . 	0
WD	9609	She turned 5 in early September , but our thought was emotionally , she wasn ' t ready , so she started at 6 . 	0
WD	9610	I lost all faith in our local public educators when I was repeatedly asked " You ' re an engineer , like on a train ? " and " How do I hook this to the computer ? " 	0
WD	9611	( speaking about the cardboard pinhole camera we had made that day with the class , with film ) 	0
WD	9612	I am a product of private school vs the rather run down public school around the corner from where I grew up . 	0
WD	9613	I later worked in an after school science program in public schools . 	0
WD	9614	I can attest , that if I went to these schools , I would not have been there to test these kids after school . 	0
WD	9615	The only way my parents could have fixed it , as the author claims would have happened , is if they quit their jobs and taught themselves . 	0
WD	9616	On the other side Homechoolers , depending on where you live and possibly how you are homeschooled , have homeschooling groups which not only have a large group of people , though usually smaller thatn the public school , but have the freedom of doing things togethermore often , Time schedules are more flexible and if you really wanted to you could skip a whole day of school in the middle of the wek just to hand out eith people . 	0
WD	9617	This point may actually lead to a superiorty in certain areas on one side or the other 	0
WD	9618	Where you could study the World in Highschool , , I might spend two years just to get an overview of the United States History in college . 	0
WD	9619	Another point to be made is your peers , if your a introvert , than it doesn ' t really matter which school you go to on this point , If you are an extrovert then here are the facts : when public school was created , many people grasped it to recieve a free education and now it is a part of everyday life , at least it is in the United States , that means that there are a lot of poeple in public school and so it would be great for an extrovert . 	0
WD	9620	Salomone also states that single-sex schooling for promotes interest for boys in humanities courses and that boys ’ feel more at ease because they do not feel societal pressures to be male . 	0
WD	9621	Challenge school committees to reconsider whether standardized testing in the lower elementary grades is a good idea . 	0
WD	9622	When my daughter has a 4 year window in HS to succeed or not to succeed , I don ' t have time to drive the change that typically take years . 	0
WD	9623	That was all it took for me to send her to the private school where the learning environment is better and the teachers can do something about it . 	0
WD	9624	I don ' t disagree the author about the parents driving change but guess what ? 	0
WD	9625	grades say " the kids are such a distraction in the classroom and I can ' t concentrate / work . 	0
WD	9626	And the teachers can ' t do anything about it . " 	0
WD	9627	I have students in both private and public schools . 	0
WD	9628	When I heard my daughter ( in 8th grade at a public school ) , who has to work very hard to get slightly above avg . 	0
WD	9629	You don ’ t have to believe it but it ’ s true . 	0
WD	9630	Every knee will bow and toung confess that JESUS is LORD . 	0
WD	9631	Try reading the BIBLE and see what it says . 	0
WD	9632	Just because you don ’ t believe something doesn ’ t mean it doesn ’ t exist . 	0
WD	9633	Since that was removed almost 50 years ago we have been spiralling out of control . 	0
WD	9634	The fact is that as long as we were a praying nation in school and in government we were truly a blessed nation . 	0
WD	9635	Wow anyone who does not believe prayer should be in school has not studied history . 	0
WD	9636	This lady is something else . 	0
WD	9637	First of all let me say , my children attend a private school . 	0
WD	9638	Our district schools are less than admirable . 	0
WD	9639	Having attended our district schools myself all throughout my childhood , it is clear that our district schools have issues . . . financially and educationally . 	0
WD	9640	I agree that if I sent my child to a public school I would do everything in my power to help make it a better place for all children but why would I subject my children to that experiment when I have the choice to send them to a private school where I can be involved in the school without having to help fix it ? 	0
WD	9641	I ' m not saying that private schools are worry-free or perfect by any means but our private school is a hell of a lot better than our local district schools . 	0
WD	9642	I ' m still a citizen that pays taxes that go to my local school district . . . whether I agree with it or not ! 	0
WD	9643	Our district will be voting on a budget override for the third time this year . 	0
WD	9644	While the 60 Minutes piece suggested that some parents hold children back from kindergarten to gain competitive advantages , Dr . Densmore pointed out that many parents are responding to the shift in what kindergarten is . 	0
WD	9645	Really ? 	0
WD	9646	The private schools that I have visited have a form that they want the parent ’ s sign , that the children can be disciplined . 	0
WD	9647	It is to learn and become educated and become the successful people that we all know they can be . 	0
WD	9648	Forcing your religion on someone else is wrong and if your faith is not strong enough to withstand any of the statements above without you becoming frustrated or enraged , then maybe you should visit your local religious establishment and pray for open mindedness and patience . 	0
WD	9649	Thank you for your time . 	0
WD	9650	-Mick 	0
WD	9651	As mentioned in a study by Mael ( 1998 ) coeducation classrooms and schools reflect real life and prepare youths for gender interactions and society more so than a single-sex school would , it could also reduce sex stereotypes . 	0
WD	9652	There are MANY issues with how public education is formed , and the parents sending their kids to private school , are not going to make a difference . 	0
WD	9653	We all learned as young women the hard-to-measure notion that females can be leaders in any area just by looking around us at our peers . 	0
WD	9654	I have seen a few schools that if the form is not signed , they tell you that there school might not be right for you . 	0
WD	9655	I don ' t think we should pretend it couldn ' t happen but I agree that the automatic suspicion of the government is , in itself , highly damaging . 	0
