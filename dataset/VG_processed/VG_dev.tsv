VG	21	They as well , believed with all their hearts that this man , whom they slept with , whom they ate with and whom they fought with , was in fact recieving Revelation from GOD . 	1
VG	22	But , what is different between Muhammad and other perported figures who claimed Divine Revelation , were those who were closest to him . 	0
VG	23	So , if Muhammad exhibited such outstanding moral characteristics that those who were not close to him would come to believe that he was always a trustworthy and honourable person , and that they would have no reason to disbelieve in his claim of Divine Revelation . 	0
