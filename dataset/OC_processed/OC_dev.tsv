OC	511	I think that everything will be ok . . . 	1
OC	512	I guess I felt pretty jaded about this film before I saw it , less so now that I ' ve seen it . . . but I wasn ' t jaded because I ' m just some cynical , bitter queen : I ' m jaded partly because I see the potential for something even MORE wonderful than this film . 	0
OC	513	And I hear that same longing in the word of a lot of the other queens out there who are taken as " bitter . " 	0
OC	514	I can see that way of responding to it ; I was more aware of the differences , and a little more aware that , as painful as some of my own life was in the past , I live a much better life now . 	0
OC	515	And like furr_a_bruin , I ' m ready to see films where the men lead lives a little more like the ones some of us really do get to live these days . 	0
OC	516	Whereas Alan was reminded of how he felt isolated and didn ' t even realize that when he was in college in Indiana in the early 1970s , there were gay bars all over Indianapolis where he could have gone . 	0
OC	517	If we take this story personally as a comment on how much the world hasn ' t changed for gay and bi men , or as a look at a common history many of us share , I think it works a lot better . 	0
OC	518	Much of the progress in our world as gay and bi men has happened because men dared to keep at those kinds of dreams . 	0
OC	519	I also have to say , I ' m always SO uncomfortable when gay men call each other " jaded queens " over their disagreements . 	0
OC	520	I agree that it ' s not all that likely that Hollywood will want to make such films any time soon , but the fact that I have big dreams is NOT a flaw in me , or in anyone else . 	1
OC	521	It just means we have dreams and needs that can ' t always get met right now . 	0
OC	522	Sorry you can ' t make it , but , yes , there will be others . 	0

OC	528	Even if every state has this , that ' s still 50 individuals who think they ' re in charge . 	0

OC	532	I never knew if she was just joking around , or whatever . 	0
OC	533	Also , she ' s been with this guy for like , 5 years , so I dunno . 	0
OC	534	Maybe it was -his - fantasy ? 	0

OC	612	I think people are responding strongly to the story partly because of something envirobear said earlier in this thread : " The story . . . is sparse . . . that is part of its power , because it requires the reader or viewer to put his / her OWN experiences into play and feel the emotion generated from within yourself . " 	1
OC	613	I think a lot of us are seeing this movie through the lens of our own experiences , and it ' s feeling intensely personal because we line the pain the characters feel up with whatever we ' ve been through that feels similar and was painful at the time . 	0
OC	614	To me , it ' s the film ' s biggest strength AND greatest weakness . 	0
OC	615	I got into a bit of an argument with my own partner last night , because he was telling me about how " this is the story that a lot of gay and bi men still live and struggle with , " and I was saying , " Well , yes , I ' m sure it is , but not exactly , and the differences may be important , and maybe we shouldn ' t overpersonalize this . " 	0
OC	616	I mean , I actually did live in Wyoming in the late 1980s , a few years after this film ends . 	0
OC	617	catalina = yes . 	0
OC	618	They also told us not to get caught at the gay bars in Denver . 	0
OC	619	Which is to say , by the time I lived in Wyoming , twenty years after the characters in the film were that age , we had words like " gay " and concepts like " gay bar , " even if they were two hours away and sounded scary . 	0
OC	620	I was closeted , felt isolated , and dated a couple of women . . . but even in 1985 , I was vaguely aware that there were other options . 	0
OC	621	Now in 2005 , the options are even greater , even if the isolation and depression and feelings of entrapment still hit a lot of us . 	0

OC	721	Jim Henson ' s passion for his work gave us the Muppets , characters that millions of people love . 	0
OC	722	Leaving the argument about the words " gay " or " love " out of this , clearly there ' s supposed to be a great deal of passion here - hence the bit about " a force of nature " in the advertising for the movie . 	0
OC	723	You make some excellent points - but my core objection ( perhaps I ' m not expressing myself well ) is very simple . 	0

OC	757	I was scared for her . 	0
OC	758	It was like she tried to throw up , but couldn ' t , and then she was breathing through her mouth really , really heavily . 	0

OC	769	. 	0
OC	770	The core of where I was going definitionally was the difference in approach - from my reading thus far , the question , " by what means can we best achieve our goals ? " seems to be the main way in which " schools " of feminism split off from each other ( first-wave example : the suffragists and those who focused on equality in educational opportunities [ educationalists ? ? ] ) 	0
OC	771	I don ' t consider " Marxist " to be part of the definition , nor even " collectivist-socialist " - that bit was more a reflection on how , and in what part of the zeitgeist of the times , radical feminism did much of its developing . 	0
OC	772	Yup , I ' ve been talking about the " different jurisdictions , different conditions " thing all along ( and was pleased to read your German example - I know very little about how it works in countries other than Canada and the US ) . 	1
