OC	512	I guess I felt pretty jaded about this film before I saw it , less so now that I ' ve seen it . . . but I wasn ' t jaded because I ' m just some cynical , bitter queen : I ' m jaded partly because I see the potential for something even MORE wonderful than this film . 	0
OC	513	And I hear that same longing in the word of a lot of the other queens out there who are taken as " bitter . " 	0
OC	514	I can see that way of responding to it ; I was more aware of the differences , and a little more aware that , as painful as some of my own life was in the past , I live a much better life now . 	0
OC	515	And like furr_a_bruin , I ' m ready to see films where the men lead lives a little more like the ones some of us really do get to live these days . 	0
OC	516	Whereas Alan was reminded of how he felt isolated and didn ' t even realize that when he was in college in Indiana in the early 1970s , there were gay bars all over Indianapolis where he could have gone . 	0
OC	517	If we take this story personally as a comment on how much the world hasn ' t changed for gay and bi men , or as a look at a common history many of us share , I think it works a lot better . 	0
OC	518	Much of the progress in our world as gay and bi men has happened because men dared to keep at those kinds of dreams . 	0
OC	519	I also have to say , I ' m always SO uncomfortable when gay men call each other " jaded queens " over their disagreements . 	0
OC	520	I agree that it ' s not all that likely that Hollywood will want to make such films any time soon , but the fact that I have big dreams is NOT a flaw in me , or in anyone else . 	1
OC	521	It just means we have dreams and needs that can ' t always get met right now . 	0
OC	522	Sorry you can ' t make it , but , yes , there will be others . 	0

OC	528	Even if every state has this , that ' s still 50 individuals who think they ' re in charge . 	0

OC	534	Maybe it was -his - fantasy ? 	0

OC	612	I think people are responding strongly to the story partly because of something envirobear said earlier in this thread : " The story . . . is sparse . . . that is part of its power , because it requires the reader or viewer to put his / her OWN experiences into play and feel the emotion generated from within yourself . " 	1
OC	613	I think a lot of us are seeing this movie through the lens of our own experiences , and it ' s feeling intensely personal because we line the pain the characters feel up with whatever we ' ve been through that feels similar and was painful at the time . 	0
OC	614	To me , it ' s the film ' s biggest strength AND greatest weakness . 	0
OC	615	I got into a bit of an argument with my own partner last night , because he was telling me about how " this is the story that a lot of gay and bi men still live and struggle with , " and I was saying , " Well , yes , I ' m sure it is , but not exactly , and the differences may be important , and maybe we shouldn ' t overpersonalize this . " 	0

OC	617	catalina = yes . 	0
OC	618	They also told us not to get caught at the gay bars in Denver . 	0
OC	619	Which is to say , by the time I lived in Wyoming , twenty years after the characters in the film were that age , we had words like " gay " and concepts like " gay bar , " even if they were two hours away and sounded scary . 	0
OC	620	I was closeted , felt isolated , and dated a couple of women . . . but even in 1985 , I was vaguely aware that there were other options . 	0
OC	621	Now in 2005 , the options are even greater , even if the isolation and depression and feelings of entrapment still hit a lot of us . 	0

OC	722	Leaving the argument about the words " gay " or " love " out of this , clearly there ' s supposed to be a great deal of passion here - hence the bit about " a force of nature " in the advertising for the movie . 	0

OC	770	The core of where I was going definitionally was the difference in approach - from my reading thus far , the question , " by what means can we best achieve our goals ? " seems to be the main way in which " schools " of feminism split off from each other ( first-wave example : the suffragists and those who focused on equality in educational opportunities [ educationalists ? ? ] ) 	0
OC	771	I don ' t consider " Marxist " to be part of the definition , nor even " collectivist-socialist " - that bit was more a reflection on how , and in what part of the zeitgeist of the times , radical feminism did much of its developing . 	0
OC	772	Yup , I ' ve been talking about the " different jurisdictions , different conditions " thing all along ( and was pleased to read your German example - I know very little about how it works in countries other than Canada and the US ) . 	1

OC	1003	they ' re cautionary tales and fables as well - it ' s sad that they ' re dismissed so readily by people who ' ve probably never even read them . 	0
OC	1004	they definately do not promote or condone slavery in the least - if anything they ' re against it , as the hoovmeister said . 	1

OC	1795	Gay , bi , or whatever , I think that ' s the lesson I learned , and the film is about what happens if you * don ' t * learn and apply that lesson . 	0
OC	1796	The publicity for the film gets the film wrong , but I think the film gets this point sort of " right . " 	0
OC	1797	I hear you more clearly . 	0
OC	1798	I suppose I could agree with you and still go in a slightly different direction : I think stunted passion can drive people to lead lives in which they appear to be passionless . 	1
OC	1799	It ' s not an easy mindset to recall after nearly a decade being out of the closet , but I would say that I spent a good deal of my 20s , when I felt both uncomfortable with my own sexuality and isolated about being who I was , using my drive and my power as an intellectual , emotional , and spiritual being to either route my passion anywhere BUT sex , or to holding myself in . 	0
OC	1800	In a sense , what the movie gets " right " for me happens most clearly with Ennis ' s character : the force of nature of his passion is one he devotes to containing himself , rather than trying to break free . 	0
OC	1801	And he does fail to contain himself in many ways . . . but what ' s tragic is that had he failed a little more , he might have been able to succeed at something a lot more fulfilling . 	0
OC	1802	Does that make any sense ? 	0
OC	1803	Maybe one way I could come at it is nothing more than this : I had a couple of clunky , difficult relationships with women before I came out as a queer man , and I ' ve had a couple of decent relationships with women since coming out , fucking around with a lot of men , and giving my whole heart and soul to a couple of men over the years . 	0
OC	1804	Which is to say : although my desires for women are a fairly small part of my overall makeup , I could only express them decently once I took the brakes off my WHOLE self . 	0

OC	1818	( Sheep have a flap of ' foreskin ' type thing that hangs off their butts and gets painfully infected by parasites and leads to their death - so sheep herders in the maritimes have been and other peoples have been cutting that skin off for THOUSANDS OF YEARS - but now they ' re writting letters to us demanding we ban it . 	0
OC	1819	They ' ve got pictures circulating of people from Abu Ghraib , covered in what appears to be shit and blood , being beat , hung upside down , raped and worse - though I shudder to think of what could be worse than what I ' ve seen so far . 	0

OC	1925	It seems counterintuitive , but the Church knows just as well as anyone how ridiculous they would look treating every rebellious teen as possessed , or what have you . 	0
OC	1926	The chief of the branch should be even more responsible than the run-of-the-mill exorcist , not less . 	0
OC	1927	Yes . 	1
OC	1928	Well , frankly ? 	0
OC	1929	The job of exorcist is supposed to be rather like folks involved in canonization - to be skeptical , seek solid evidence , then act - not to see devils everywhere and try to solve every problem with exorcism . 	0

OC	3299	Obviously everyone except for Wilf is protected by not having fully human DNA and thus being immune to the overwrite . 	0
OC	3300	So are we supposed to assume that the only non-Master people left on the planet are Wilf , the Doctor , Donna , and maybe the green people ? 	0
OC	3301	The Naismith family also needs some background info , as well as the green people . 	0
OC	3302	Still , how does a former prime minister gather a crazed group of disciples ? 	0
OC	3303	Presumably , because at the end of series three they only rewound to right before the arrival of the American convoy , there ' d still be stuff left about Saxon ' s existence . 	0

OC	3316	I have been struggling with this for a really long while and she has expressed interest in meeting me as well . 	0
OC	3317	I really , really want to meet her , but I am afraid because I don ' t know what to expect , if anything . 	0
OC	3318	Thank you for the opportunity to get this off of my chest . 	0
OC	3319	I can ' t seem to get over this insane crush that I have on a girl that I met in the Colbert community . 	0
OC	3320	She and I have a lot in common and I always eagerly await her comments , replies , etc and find myself wanting to do things for her and talk to her , but I already have someone in my life and it is frankly really confusing . 	0
OC	3321	Part of me is telling myself to be careful because I already have someone , but another part of me really wishes that I could go for her . 	0
OC	3322	I honestly have little attraction to men as a rule in the physical sense , so personality , talents , mannerisms , and interests become more of the basis for my feelings for someone . 	0

OC	3368	But I wouldn ' t recommend it if you intend on linking a lot of people to it because it has a tendency to go " OMG TOO MANY PAGE VIEWS EXCEEDED BANDWIDTH WE ARE GONNA MAKE DIS IMAGE UNAVAILABABLE UNTIL NEXT MONTH ! " 	0

OC	3370	I was going to suggest Facebook , but FB has a 60 image limit per album and uploads can be a bit of a bitch . 	1

OC	3396	i seem to have successfully extracted myself from academia , for the time being - - somehow managed to graduate last sunday - - and have landed in the most mahvelous summer job at the tar pits as the assistant excavator and it ' s like summer camp , only better , because i get PAID to learn anatomy and hang out with the loveliest people and i HURT everywhere my last day at the vile lawfirm was tuesday first day at the museum on wednesday and five days straight excavating since then and i hurt EVerywhere my back , my right arm , my left palm , my abdominal muscles , my feet - - which is bizarre because i spend most of my day lying on my stomach , leaning over a 3 x 3 foot grid of asphalt picking at dead animals and i am just so thrilled to be in so much pain it ' s great and i don ' t have a paper to write ! 	1

OC	3424	I know , it ' s irritating . 	0
OC	3425	I have issues with " film critics " who insert their own visions of what they believe is " proper sociology " --whether it ' s a homophobic straight man sniffing at the concept of two men , or homo-superior asswipes who believe that how THEY met and how THEY live THEIR lives should be the universally-accepted way of depicting man-to-man relationships without accepting differences or nuances . 	0
OC	3426	Some people have issues with the story . . . others don ' t want to deal with the hype about it . . . . others see something to it . . . and all points of view are fine . 	0
OC	3427	As difficult as it may be to crack the shells some of us use to protect ourselves from life ' s difficulties and frustrations , you learn nothing about yourself if you choose to learn nothing from the experiences of others , fictional or not . 	0
OC	3428	I ' ve had my own experience in losing people and property by murder , death , robbery , and accident to know that it ' s awful to live through and easier to deal with with the compassion of others . 	0
OC	3429	I don ' t have to live through a hurricane myself in order to do SOMETHING to help people affected by one . . . 	0
OC	3430	Putting it another way , my mother never had to understand my " thing " for facial hair and particular traits in men in order for her empathize with my need for male companionship . . . she knows the need for male companionship satisfied by my dad . . . 	0
OC	3431	If you can ' t put yourself in a position to either sympathize or empathize with at least one of the things you credit to my " logic " , then the storyline will hold nothing for you . . . and that would be unfortunate . 	0
OC	3432	No , you don ' t need to be bi male shepherds on a mountain in Wyoming to " legitimately " comment on it . . . for you to UNDERSTAND the story , you need to be able to sympathize or empathize with the characters and their situation . 	1
OC	3433	And that is bullshit posturing not worth the electrons that carry their spew of " holding court " . 	0
OC	3434	I think most movie critics are full of pompous self-centered hot air to begin with , and these guys worry too much about the genre and storyline than they do about the technical expertise of the screenplay or the quality of the cinematography or direction or production , or the artistic value of the sound track or skills of the actors . 	0
OC	3435	Aha ! 	0
OC	3436	Yes , it was completely anonymous . 	0

OC	3455	Sometimes the " I am putting all the food I own into this one meal before it goes bad while I am at home for a week " meal ends up being pretty damn good , but it was not the International Passport with Swedish pancakes and lingonberries . 	0
OC	3456	So I made myself a spinach salad with sliced pears , crumbled bacon , shredded Jarlsberg cheese , and raspberry vinaigrette . 	0
OC	3457	I had every intention of going to the Harvard Square IHOP on Saturday afternoon before flying back home , but I realized that I had a ton of food in my fridge that needed to be cooked and eaten ( including a pound of salmon that had gone bad anyway - FAIL ) . 	0

OC	3468	And honestly , if I wanted to have a screenshot of a site to make it look nice , I ' d probably at least consider using Safari ; the stuff is more typographically " correct " using that rendering , which in the context of an image of a site may well look better . 	0
OC	3469	A lot of people seem to prefer it , though . 	0

OC	3851	As to why I don ' t have shell eggs , it ' s twofold : I do better when I avoid egg yolks , and my use of eggs in general is mostly for baking . 	0
OC	3852	So as long as I keep that in mind and reduce the oil by at least 1 / 3 , it should be okay . 	0
OC	3853	Really , the only thing likely to give me fits is the egg / oil mix , because I ' ve found that my egg white breads don ' t " hold " the oil the same way when made with whole eggs . 	1
OC	3854	I don ' t have any milk-milk , so I ' ll need to reconstitute some from powder , then measure it , because I ' m not sure exactly how much powder and water are needed for three tablespoons ( 2tsp of powder and 8tsp of water ? ) and with quantities in this range , there ' s less tolerance for error , but that ' s not bad . 	1
OC	3855	I have the flour and the sugar , so that ' s set . 	0
OC	3856	It was a thinking-out-loud sort of thing . 	0
OC	3857	And it ' s not the last word . 	0
OC	3858	According to the head of a group advocating for G / L federal employees , Obama * can ' t * simply unilaterally change pension and healthcare rights without Congressional action . 	0
OC	3859	But something * did * happen . 	0
OC	3860	It ' s not all that we would have wanted , but it ' s more than ever happened under Bush . 	0
OC	3861	The words of my defensive driving instructor ! ! 	0
OC	3862	Believe me , that ' s exactly what was going through my head ! 	0
OC	3863	I understand your frustration and disappointment , but don ' t treat something valuable as nothing because it ' s not everything all at once . 	0
OC	3864	I was envious of them , but I would never be that stupid go between the traffic . 	0
OC	3865	That ' ll learn you ! 	0
OC	3866	The only reason our schools are " competitive " is because the administration choose to do things like this : force us to choose between our own school and everyone else . 	0
OC	3867	and , of course , we are obligated to choose our own school . 	0
OC	3868	I may crash some Paxon after " party , " because I miss you guys , but Stanton prom is free , and your prom is expensive . 	1
OC	3869	Oh I wasn ' t woken up , I was very awake . 	0
OC	3870	; ) I ' m two weeks behind on the show , but I ' ve just binged on a whole bunch of Mentalist fic , and it has driven home for me yet again how that guy is one giant pile of reckless , self-loathing craaaaazy . 	0
OC	3871	I remember it was MIDNIGHT I actually went to sleep whereas when you came I was at the computer . 	0
OC	3872	It seems to me that the overwhelming mass of their garments is only accentuated with the ridiculous level of adornment ; it ’ s as if someone reached back into the early 90 ’ s , got their hands on a Bedazzler and went plastic rhinestone crazy . 	0

OC	3875	gosh , that murakami exhibit at the brooklyn museum was awesome , wasn ' t it ? 	0
OC	3876	But if we do , there ' s an obligation to be careful where we point the thing . 	1
OC	3877	It ' s generally a bad idea to make one ' s " feminist " argument at the expense of actual women ' s experiences . 	0
OC	3878	if something causes wisps of steam to begin issuing from my ears , I will almost certainly learn something significant from it . 	0
OC	3879	There are folks whose writing I read primarily for that purpose - though a fair chunk of the time , it ' s my own argument that gets vivisected . 	0
OC	3880	That kind of situation is what the phrase " stop being on my side , you ' re making my side look stupid " was invented for . 	0
OC	3881	I like this one too . 	0

OC	3888	eh , ya aint too bad 	0
OC	3889	Ok have a good evening : ) may be see you later : ) 	0
OC	3890	It ' s not just an academic exercise in utopian philosophy ; real people , with diverse individual needs , will be living the changes we make . 	0
OC	3891	Making feminist arguments at the expense of actual women ' s experiences is , IMO , one of the most significant fracture points within feminism , The reverse is also true : the political is personal . 	0
OC	3892	Mind you , Canada isn ' t perfect , by any means ; another part of why it was possible for me is because my family was supportive - I ' d have been in a much more precarious position if they weren ' t . 	0
OC	3893	Kid won , of course . ) 	0
OC	3894	( My son ' s father didn ' t even get an opt-in ; he was . . . not very stable - but again , Canadian conditions meant I only had to consider that problem in terms of the personal , weighing fairness to him against what it could mean for my baby if he took it into his head to try for custody . 	0
OC	3895	I ' m pretty sure we ' re at least close to the same page - it ' s partly because Canada has some of those social and legal conditions that I was able to let my daughter ' s father opt out . 	1
OC	3896	( IOW , I think he might be a Nice Guy ( tm ) . ) 	0
OC	3897	What I suspect here is that he has a vested interest in not changing the institutional injustices , because in a just world , women wouldn ' t need men . 	0
OC	3898	I suspect the latter , because of him bringing up " pregnancy is so dangerous " as an argument supporting mandatory support - the only connection I can see between them is that the financial support would mean better health care ( assuming the father , or his parents , have or are able to earn enough to make a difference ) and an improved , but not risk-free , outcome ; otherwise , obligating the father ' s involvement has no effect on those dangers ( or may have a negative effect ) . 	0
OC	3899	I ' m not so sure the KiSA is on your side ; he didn ' t seem to have the slightest interest in the injustices I was trying to talk about - at best , he ' s convinced they ' re immutable ; at worst , he ' s got a hidden agenda . 	1

OC	4555	They manage to scrape together the money for their own ranch , and indeed have a period of some happiness together , during which they wind up shooting to death a couple shitheads who come to their spread with the intent of killing our protagonists - in circumstances that make it clear it was self defense . 	0

OC	4560	OK , so I ' m throwing in some cliches here as shorthand , but the point is all that passion drives them TO something . 	0
OC	4561	They don ' t have to be " gay " , they just have to NOT be utterly fucking STUPID . 	0
OC	4562	I don ' t recall the characters in the story being portrayed as being particularly dim , so I find it difficult to believe that EVEN in the given setting , it ' s impossible for them to conceive of a way to be together that would slip under the radar , or behind the common presumptions of the time , at least for a while . 	0
OC	4563	I ' m no stranger to holding a minority opinion in a variety of fields , but it ' s been rare that I ' ve gotten this much personal hostility over openly stating I dislike a particular story , and that I can ' t for the life of me understand why people are cumming all over themselves about it . 	0

OC	4586	The McLellan family had written to Canadian senators to say they cancelled a vacation in Canada because of the hunt , which they called " horrible " and " inhumane , " Montreal ' s La Presse reports . 	0
OC	4587	While I don ' t at all agree with the seal hunt , I give huge props to this : Senator fires back at U . S . family upset with seal hunt A Liberal senator has replied to a family in Minnesota upset about Canada ' s seal hunt with a letter denouncing the United States for executing prisoners at home and killing people in Iraq . 	0
OC	4588	She said Americans are not in a position to criticize others . 	0
OC	4589	In her response , Senator Céline Hervieux-Payette said that what she finds horrible is " the daily massacre of innocent people in Iraq , the execution of prisoners – mainly blacks – in American prisons , the massive sale of handguns to Americans , the destabilization of the entire world by the American government ' s aggressive foreign policy , etc .

OC	4592	Full article . 	0
OC	4593	CNN probably unfairly concluded that blacks overwhelmingly voted for prop 8 , but it doesn ' t excuse anyone for voting for prop 8 , because a lot of every race was responsible for its passage . 	0
OC	4594	( Actually , the pro-8 people really really twisted it so bad it made me want to puke . ) 	0
OC	4595	We all know religion was what caused the passage , but my main gripe was that people decided to fall on religion instead of their experience to vote . 	0
OC	4596	But let ' s assume that poll conducted by CNN was severely flawed as speculated . 	0
OC	4597	I was more upset that a majority of people who voted for the issue didn ' t see the measure as an issue of rights and equality for all , just about gay marriage . 	0
OC	4598	Again , expectations were turned upside-down , and that was what upset me the most . 	0
OC	4599	Even the Catholic church made a huge push to support 8 as well , but the Hispanics who are usually very religious only barely supported the measure . 	0
OC	4600	So many good ones to choose from ! 	0
OC	4601	Turns out it was the other way around . 	0
OC	4602	I originally thought that the Hispanic population would have overwhelmingly voted for prop 8 , and that the blacks would be 50 / 50 . 	0

OC	4645	In fact , one of the reasons it was not made clear what benefits would be included until today is they announced it before they even figured out what they could put in it . 	0
OC	4646	Formulation of this may have been started back in January , but somehow it disappeared and the administration has admitted this is only being done because some big money gay donors started to pull out of a big DNC fundraising soiree over the administration ' s hate brief on DOMA . 	0

OC	4716	There are feminist theorists who have posited that full equality will only be possible when all babies are grown in vitro - a stance that at least proposes a solution , rather than shaking its fist at the slings and arrows of outrageous biology , but . . . well , rather than writing yet another essay in a comment , I ' ll just say I find it extreme . 	0

OC	5016	After my post a bit earlier in Windows Safari , kurisu posted this fascinating article on the differences between Windows and OS X ( and now Safari for Windows ) font rendering , which has puzzled me for ages . 	0
OC	5017	I think it ' s fair to say that neither is " better " , but it ' s interesting to see the way the different approaches go . 	1
OC	5018	So far we ' ve watched Seasons 1 , 2 and 7 . 	0

OC	5020	We are trying to catch up on Survivor before watching this current season of Heroes vs Villains to really appreciate who all these people are . 	0

OC	5027	Anyone know where I can get seasons 3-6 that isn ' t a choppy , garbley mess with a giant logo slapped over a huge part of it ? 	0
OC	5028	The only good thing about this whole nightmare is seeing how loving and selfless people are being towards the victims of this fire . 	0
OC	5029	And that doesn ' t even touch the vast differences between the lives we are able to live NOW versus the experiences of non-urban gay and bi men prior to the 1970 ' s . 	0
OC	5030	It ' s one thing to not understand what you ' ve never experienced , it ' s another thing entirely to disdain what you don ' t understand without making an attempt to walk a mile in the boots you turn your nose up over . 	0
OC	5031	You have to apply your OWN experiences and ability to read non-verbal communication and pluck yourself out of L . A . or Cambridge and the life you live NOW in order to feel the impact of the setting and circumstances of the story . . . and if you ' ve never been in love , never lived with vast distance between you and someone you love , never lived in small-town rural America , never lived with having nearly everyone in a 20-mile radius KNOWING you and your family , never lived with all those people who are the extent of your known world putting very exacting expectations on how you will live and die . . . then you will have trouble connecting with the film and the story . 	0
OC	5032	The story of " Brokeback Mountain " is sparse . . . that is part of its power , because it requires the reader or viewer to put his / her OWN experiences into play and feel the emotion generated from within yourself --not something that grabs you by the shoulders and says " Oh , Bob--I LOVE YOU ! " and turns into a chick-flick full of flowery prose and verbal vomit that leads you to big block letters saying " THIS IS A LOVE STORY . . . YOU CAN TELL FROM THE LINES . " 	1
OC	5033	And while Mars-Jones may have worked with Edmund White and spent some time in Charlottesville , Virginia , I have serious doubts if the Brit truly grasps the lives of rural Americans who are NOT in the " ivory tower " . 	1
OC	5034	I agree with you whole-heartedly about Ehrenstein--he probably has never stepped outside of his little world to see , much less understand , how rural gay AND bisexual men live outside his little bubble of long-term happy partnership in a place where the dirtiest thing one encounters is the street person he passes on the sidewalk and inhabits the happy land of make-believe of movies and live-as-queerly-as-you-want-without-fear . 	0
OC	5035	They are happy to be urban--and urbane- - " queers " of 2005 , and they never presume to " lower themselves " to understand lives that are different from their own . . . very much like the Log Cabin Republicans who are more concerned about taking care of their POSESSIONS than they are about the big-picture of what their political support does to us as a minority population . . . as " W " has no clue or compassion regarding the outcomes of his policies , since he has never lived with privation , never had to worry about how he would pay the bills if his job went away because someone always swooped in to fix things for him if things fell apart in his private life . 	1
OC	5036	That is the big problem with blowhards like them- - they have never experienced the isolation and loneliness and societal pressure put on less-than-college-degreed rural American gay and bisexual men . . . therefore the story and the premise means NOTHING to them . 	0
OC	5037	I ' m pretty numb right now and trying to stay that way so I don ' t have a meltdown . 	0
OC	5038	But it always leads to lives and potential unfulfilled when love is thwarted . . . and depression , too . 	1
OC	5039	It ' s a love story alright . . . but it ' s a tragedy , too . . . passion between two people does not always lead to a happy conclusion when conditioning from childhood and reinforcement by a society that can ' t be separated from your own life makes your allegiance to compliance more important than what you love . 	0

OC	5375	I think my spiffy new icon tells you quite a lot about what I , as a feminist , think of men ( however they identify ) who want to slay villains for me . 	0
OC	5376	As I ' ve already mentioned , I ' m down with ( authentic ) male feminists ; they are my brothers-in-arms , and I ' m very glad to have them fighting beside me , watching my back , and all those other good warrior metaphors . 	0
OC	5377	( And when we get back to the barracks . . . um , never mind . ) 	0

OC	5380	So - you can see Sir Lancelot in action at Derek ' s Doing Feminism - not Derek ; you should have no trouble identifying the guy in the tin suit in the comments , even before I take him to task . 	0
OC	5381	Since ol ' Lance has already transformed himself into Brave Sir Robin and flounced ( ' bout a six , I figure ; the execution was technically quite good , if unoriginal , until he spoiled it by coming back for one parting shot ) , there ' s little point in piling on him there ; I doubt it ' ll penetrate his + 4 Armor of Complacence ( what , surely you don ' t think he won ' t sneak back to see how we took it ? ) , and it ' ll just distract further from what could be a very productive discussion ( which you could join if you ' re so inclined ) . 	0
OC	5382	Anyway , it wouldn ' t be courteous to Derek . 	0
OC	5383	And , since I ' m going to mention over there that I ' ve snarked about it here , with link , chances are we ' ll have a meal of Silly Knigget deliver itself right to my doorstep - dinner ' s on me ! 	0

OC	6106	Well you can repent of a sin , and then live in grace . 	1
OC	6107	And it gets more complicated of course , because some Protestants believe that salvation is through faith alone , some through faith and acts , and some still even believe in Pre-Destination , which means either you ' re on the list or your not and nothing you do in this life has a bearing on that . 	1
OC	6108	Protestants don ' t have that option , because they don ' t believe their preachers stand in for God , and so they don ' t have the power to absolve . 	0

OC	6735	This particular argument has more to do with social standards . 	0
OC	6736	It is accepted that all people are " sinners " but Christians are supposed to repent their sins . 	0
OC	6737	I ' m not a Christian so I ' m not sure how " Grace " figures into this discussion . 	0
OC	6738	My understanding is that " grace " has to do with salvation . 	0
OC	6739	My argument is just that it is hypocritical to punish homosexuals for being unrepentant sinners but allow divorced people off the hook . 	0
OC	6740	Christ didn ' t say anything about homosexuals but he was quite explicit about divorce . 	0
OC	6741	The issue seems to be that giving social status in the Church to unrepentant sinners would encourage sin by setting a bad example . 	0

OC	6778	They were right ; they just handled the announcement poorly . 	0
OC	6779	That there is even a need for that implies that people aren ' t happy with the government . 	0
OC	6780	The essence of the social contract is that if people aren ' t happy , the government should change--not that the government should try to gather intelligence to increase its power over them . 	0

OC	6831	I ' ll say that your inner circle of friends are prolly the only ones you should be as honest as you want with . 	0
OC	6832	Why ? 	0

OC	6954	Sometimes the arguments are so devoid of intelligence , or I ' ve heard them so many times before , that there ' s no reward in refuting them , but if the other side is willing to engage , then having to explain myself and not getting any free passes means that the argument gets a good workout . 	0
OC	6955	Is this HHGGTG ? 	0
OC	6956	But right now we don ' t have that . 	0
OC	6957	Instead , we have conservative think tanks complaining that what little aid we do give costs too much . 	0
OC	6958	What " choice for men " comes down to for me is who bears the cost instead . 	1
OC	6959	I ' m a lot more comfortable with the idea of a father being able to legally opt out if there ' s a sufficient support system in place so that the child ' s mother can raise the child without assistance from the father - even if she chooses not to . 	0
OC	6960	But it ' s not particularly relevant here unless one takes the attitude that child support is supposed to be either compensation for , or an equivalent " punishment " to , pregnancy , and I don ' t see how one can reconcile that attitude with feminism . 	0
OC	6961	And as for calling folks on things , it depends on the situation . 	0
OC	6962	I think the bringing up of " pregnancy is so dangerous " may simply have been a context failure . 	1
OC	6963	I typically see that argument used in the context of pro-choice or childfree advocacy , and he may have just internalized that as " the feminist position . " 	0
OC	6964	So marked . 	0

OC	7525	this LJ is a place for me to express my unbridled and extremely subjective thoughts and feelings . 	0

OC	7532	i don ' t think they are idiots because they don ' t agree with me . i think they are idiots because their premises alienate and destroy . 	1
OC	7533	i don ' t care who the person is , if they have republican beliefs ( such as unregulated corporations , independence at the expense of the community , free market capitalism ) and more specifically social conservative beliefs ( such as being opposed homosexual marriage and social programs and believing in a version of family values based on twisted theology ) then i believe their beliefs are selfish , ignorant , and exceedingly adverse . 	0

OC	7542	If there is such a thing as memes ( and the theory ' s proponents say that they are things ) , then this is the meme equivalent of engineering weapons-grade strains of the Bird Flu . 	0
OC	7543	I think if you set out by saying , " Hey guys , I am starting this new meme , " then it is definitely not a meme . 	0
OC	7544	It ' s like infecting someone with a disease on purpose and saying they " caught " it . 	0
OC	7545	And if you don ' t agree it ' s only because the meme that makes you think otherwise is a strong one . 	0
OC	7546	But , anyway , yeah . 	0
OC	7547	Well , I actually don ' t much care for the term in general , as it means engaging with a corner of philosophy of the mind that I find a little silly . 	1
OC	7548	In its stronger forms , meme theory suggests that there ' s no such thing as human consciousness or thought because our brains are just spongy , meme-infested piles of goop . 	0

OC	7809	I ' m sorry to go off on you - I ' m just so angry at Americans for writing , and for Paul McCartney ' s photo op in PEI . 	0
OC	7810	In this case , polar bears , which used to be numerous in Newfoundland and Labrador , and NWT kept the seals down , but since they ' re on the extinction list . . . they haven ' t been doing alot lately . 	0
OC	7811	The number of seals has actually doubled since the 70s . . . and do you know how much they eat ? 	0
OC	7812	They would populate themselves into famine if left unchecked . 	0
OC	7813	I used to be against it , until I had to study the fisheries and now I get that though many animals are cute , and these are the ones I don ' t like seeing killed ( seals , deers , rabbits , kangaroos ) that sometimes it is necessary . 	1
OC	7814	I don ' t want to get argumentative on LJ , but why don ' t you agree with the seal hunt ? 	0
OC	7815	Do you agree with hunting deer ? 	0
OC	7816	Culling cat and dog populations by neutering ? 	0
OC	7817	The unfortunate truth is that we ' ve killed off many of the predators that kept seal populations in check ( like we did with deer and moose , etc ) . 	0

OC	7840	I ' m not sure I ' d sign on to the Marxist part of your definition of radical feminist . 	1
OC	7841	That only describes a fraction of the overall group . 	0
OC	7842	In Germany , single motherhood is less common than in the U . S . - people are less delusional about sex and birth control . 	0
OC	7843	But up until recently , anyway , going on welfare as a single mother was not terribly stigmatized . 	0
OC	7844	The German social safety net has been progressively undermined over the past few years , so I have to think that this option is getting harder - they have a lot more emphasis on working to earn one ' s benefits , which is obviously a problem if you have little ones . 	0
OC	7845	( Germany ' s public daycare system is also being slowly de-funded . ) 	0
OC	7846	Sunflower , you were in Canada when you had your babies , yes ? 	0
OC	7847	Because as jfpbookworm points out , the supports are awfully thin here in the U . S . The only reason men get stuck with child support is that society as a whole isn ' t willing to support children of single parents . 	1
OC	7848	At least in Canada , you ' re covered for health care . 	0

OC	7872	You can ' t really have that kind of set-up though , but a small office might get you pretty close . . . 	0
OC	7873	In a small office where my boss is my dad and I know the accountant pretty well , and I talk to the same fifteen subcontractors on the phone , it ' s not an overly social environment like most other jobs I ' ve had have been ( which is probably the main reason I don ' t have a rapidly developing ulcer right now ) , so I don ' t have to be that outgoing . 	0
OC	7874	About the job thing , I ' ve always just faked outgoing-ness . 	0
OC	7875	It ' s just all so out of control . 	0
OC	7876	I ' ve been listening to news less lately , too . 	0

OC	8111	I grant you there ' s a certain amount of urban sniffery in those two perspectives on thot of truth in th my pserspective there ' s also a lot of truth in what they say that most people jibbering madly about the movie just don ' t want to deal with . 	0

OC	8201	Hm , well YepRoc ' s site is not online right now . 	0
OC	8202	maybe it ' s not that they didn ' t want to fuck you before , but just feel safer telling you once you ' re in a relationship and they can ' t really act on it ? 	1
OC	8203	it may just be fear . 	0

OC	8206	        For the record : I haven ' t seen it , so I really have no opinion as of yet ; however I ' m probably gonna wait on this one - - I ' m just not a fan of Westerns .   Even though its really a movie about sheepherders .   Technically . 	0
OC	8207	It is streamable from YepRoc - - matter of fact I should update the post with a link to that . 	0
OC	8208	Wow , you didn ' t know ? 	0
OC	8209	I ' m so happy you ' ve decided as such . 	0
OC	8210	This is a great , great record . 	1
OC	8211	I keep hearing people say things like " best record since Element of Light " and " Best Record since I Often Dream of Trains " - - I ' m hesitant to say that kind of thing because I ' m not a critic ; but it is certainly in a league with Robyn ' s very best work . 	0

OC	8217	i ' m afraid someone is going to reveal something terrible about me that only people i ' ve known for years know . 	0
OC	8218	I ' ll have to ask Fay how she cooked their rooster - he turned out very tasty . 	1
OC	8219	What I take offense at is the suggestion there ' s something wrong with me for disliking the story ( and presumably by extension , the movie . ) 	0
OC	8220	Note that I ' m talking about the response to my opinion of this particular work in the aggregate , not necessarily or specifically yours . 	0
OC	8221	Whether or not the word " love " gets used or not , clearly there ' s supposedly passion in the story . . . but what does it do ? 	0
OC	8222	I take offense at the insinuation that I ' m some kind of traitor to the " Gay Cause " for thinking the story sucks and that the hype around the movie is simply INTOLERABLE . 	1
OC	8223	Passion moves fucking mountains and surmounts daunting difficulties . 	0
OC	8224	It ' s like getting a huge verbal buildup for a fireworks display that turns out to be a guy waving a couple of sparklers . 	0
OC	8225	And no , the story needn ' t have a " happy ending " in order to be satisfying . 	0

OC	8239	What ' s really pissing me off is watching a liberal reporter tour damaged areas of Lebanon with a representative of Hezbollah while he whines about what the Israelis are doing to their cities . 	1
OC	8240	WTF ? 	0
OC	8241	Maybe if your rag-headed leader hadn ' t ordered the invasion of Israel , and the kidnapping of troops they wouldn ' t be shelling the fuck out of your little hidey holes , which happen to be in civilian areas . 	0
OC	8242	Cowardly fucks . 	0
OC	8243	And the reporter is eating it up , when he should be kicking the fucker ' s ass for assuming the rest of the world is as stupid as they are . 	0
OC	8244	Oh , and the whiney ass , self-centered , American bitch that couldn ' t understand why she wasn ' t being evacuated immediately . 	0
OC	8245	" The Italians , and French got their people out . 	0

OC	8277	I ' ve just been tussling with that particularly poisonous variety of " feminist ally " , a Knight in Shining Armor . 	0
OC	8278	I ' d like to say I took him apart , but , while I believe I acquitted myself very well , I fear he missed the point altogether , and flounced with his complacence and his virtuously noble self-image unscathed . 	0
OC	8279	When I deal with them , I sound for all the world like a stereotypical grim-and-strident radical feminist - out come phrases like " sexist entitlement " and " male privilege " . 	0
OC	8280	Nope , I ' m definitely not a Fun Feminist when it comes to that . 	0
OC	8281	A Knight in Shining Armor is the sort of male self-described feminist ( or he may describe himself as a feminist ally , or some other term chosen to show that of course he ' d never usurp our movement - this one favors " radical pro-feminist " ) who is involved with feminism because he ' s Good and Noble , and will slay all the evil misogynistic patriarchal villains and make the world safe for womankind . 	0

OC	8333	I just recently learned that Sikhism is an offshoot of Hinduism . 	0

OC	8419	I know that many animators have been pushing for some kind of official rerelease just because the segments with Brer Rabbit are just damn good animation , but otherwise it wasn ' t hugely financially or critically successful and really didn ' t quite fit next to other live action / animation hybrid family films like Mary Poppins or Bedknobs and Broomsticks on the Disney Classics shelves . 	0

OC	8423	It ' s not ever overtly offensive or in any way compelling durring the live segments , but Remus does look tweeked out of his gord durring Zippadee Doo Dah and whenever the little boy cries his transforms into the vissage of a demon . 	0
OC	8424	thank you ! 	0

OC	8608	- Sunflower If I ' m reading my feminist history aright , that ' s right on the historic fracture point between liberal feminism and radical feminism ; liberal feminism preferred to address injustices by adjusting the existing paradigms , while radical feminism believed it was necessary to examine , and work to change , the paradigm itself . 	1
