WD	280	I just spent the better part of a day with the faculty of the all-girls Ellis School in Pittsburgh , where I was reminded of all the best aspects of my own education around gender and gender roles . 	0
WD	281	The survival of excellent girls ' and boys ' schools in just about every large community I can think of strikes me as testimony not to the enduring idea of separation of the sexes but rather to some very sophisticated evolving ideas of what it means to be a young woman or man . 	0
WD	282	We celebrate the suddenly disproportionate success of girls in the conventional academic realm ( they do so much better in high school that they disadvantage one another when it comes to competitive college admission ) while we wonder whether one of our unending culture wars is on boys . 	0
WD	283	Education for boys and young men is changing , and it ' s heartening , for example , to note that old-fashioned expressions of stereotypical maleness , like those caught on tape when Rutgers coach Mike Rice went off on his players , excite general shock and outrage . 	0
WD	284	Curricula increasingly include diverse viewpoints , and access to self and creativity are as much a part of boys ' school programs as lacrosse and basketball ; schools work hard to imbue students with more beneficent ideas of what it means to be male , with responsibilities and difference equal parts of the equation . 	0
WD	285	The problem is that you are only looking at 5 and 6 year olds . 	0
WD	286	They have a 100% college acceptance rate ! 	0
WD	287	I send my daughter to public school but if I could afford to I would definitely send her to a nearby private school and not have to deal with lots of the problems in public schools . 	1
WD	288	And as a public school teacher I ' m well aware of those problems . 	0
WD	289	This is bat insane ? 	0
WD	290	Parents are supposed to sacrifice their kids on the altar of public education in the rather thin hope that if " everyone does it " that the schools overall will get better and THEN their kids will get a better education ! ! ! 	0
WD	291	No one should be expected to sacrifice their kids for the " greater good " if at all possible . 	0
WD	292	It ' s a hugely complicated situation that balances child protection and the assumption that a child ' s parents are the best source of protection for them ( the current default position for child care ) . 	0
WD	293	Frankly , I doubt that any real answer will be found on this thread . 	0
WD	294	Once they start working , or going to college , they are going to be subjected to the reality of the secular world we live in , and it is better to prepare them for dealing with that fact before they are 18 years old . 	0
WD	295	It truly is not fair to deny children an education that they need to make their way in the world . 	0
WD	296	Protecting them from heathen children is not a viable strategy . 	0
WD	297	They also ensure that their children are trained in the Christian faith . 	0
WD	298	I don ' t know about the rest of Virginia , but in Northern Virginia we have excellent public schools . 	1
WD	299	The public schools are not churches and that seems to be the problem for some . 	0
WD	300	There should NOT be any praying in school . 	1
WD	301	Praying is a home thing , or a church , temple , synagogue or what have you exercise . 	0
WD	302	Prayer is not for public consumption . 	0
WD	303	Our esteemed government should also change the words of the national anthem to eliminate the sentence that is a prayer . 	0
WD	304	Canada is a secular nation . 	0
WD	305	Let ' s keep it that way . 	0
WD	306	Just do what ' s best for your kids . 	0
WD	307	Private schools don ' t promote all of this gay stuff that they call alternative lifestyles . 	0
WD	308	Also , the private schools don ' t teach all of this anti American social justice crap . 	0
WD	309	It says that transvestites can use either bathroom facilities , and that they can play on either team in sports , male or female . 	0
WD	310	Just look at the law that California governor Brown signed a couple of weeks ago . 	0
WD	311	I remember when they started teaching in Spanish in the early 1990s in Illinois . 	0
WD	312	The public schools are a bad place to send a kid for a good education anymore . 	1
WD	313	It ' s pretty bad when we have to raise kids that don ' t belong here . 	0
WD	314	My kids didn ' t speak Spanish , so I pulled them out , and they went to private schools after that . 	0
WD	315	Perhaps some Homeschool kids are ' awkward " and all that , but all the ones I know , are not . 	0
WD	316	My friend and her family are Homeschoolers and they are all friendly and funny and wonderfully nice people . 	0
WD	317	etc . . . . why would you put your child in that situation ? 	0
WD	318	( No offense to anyone here , don ' t take this wrongly . ) 	0
WD	319	My parents decided to Homeschool me ( and the rest of my siblings ) because they did not want me exposed to all of the crap that goes on in public schools . 	0
WD	320	All the drugs , swearing , bullying , condoms being handed out to young children who shouldn ' t even know what sex is yet , evolution . 	0
WD	321	But besides that , God has commanded us to train up our children , not give them to someone else where you have no control over what they are taught . 	0
WD	322	And what they are taught is directly against him . 	0
WD	323	http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=1JJW-JgHVac This film changed my perspective on public schools tremendously . 	0
WD	324	Here is the preview . 	0
WD	325	http://www.admissionsquest.com/onboardingschools/2013/09/why-we-need-private-schools.html 	0
WD	326	Good luck and I hope I helped . 	0
WD	327	Anyways , I think you should “ redshirt ” your son , but to compensate for him being the eldest child in his class , you should try to get him to excel in something . 	0
WD	328	Anything , it can be his favorite school subject ( in my case , math ) , an instrument ( piano ) , or something else he likes ( in my case , ballet ) . 	0
WD	329	This is Poppycock ! 	0
WD	330	It ' s the same as denying a sick child medicine because it offends the parents religious beliefs . 	0
WD	331	But religious zealotry is no excuse for raising a kid devoid of a proper education . 	0
WD	332	If Mom and Dad feel they are equipped to home school their children , so be it . 	0
WD	333	remember , keeping your kids away from knowledge that you don ' t like is a moral crime . 	0
WD	334	Well this has been fun but I have to go back to work . 	0
WD	335	Have a nice day . 	0
WD	336	No wonder Hurricane Katrina smote New Orleans just before a gay rally ! 	0
WD	337	No wonder hundreds of earthquakes have popped up in ‘ divers places ’ . 	0
WD	338	THink About it ! 	0
WD	339	No wonder our economy is nose-diving ! 	0
WD	340	It is just another sign of moral / spiritual decay of the American . 	0
WD	341	Prayer being removed from school is just the leading indicator of a nation that is ‘ Falling Away ’ from Jehovah . 	0
WD	342	No wonder 50 million babies have been aborted since 1973 . 	0
WD	343	And the disasters we see today are simply God ’ s finger writing on the wall : Mene , mene , Tekel , Upharsin ; that is , God has weighed America in the balances , and we ’ ve been found wanting . 	0
WD	344	We can ignore Him or listen to Him . 	0
WD	345	God ’ s speaking to us . 	0
WD	346	Public Schools are not allowed to teach religions which also teaches virtues . 	0
WD	347	We work hard to pay for private school education and I have been on both sides to see the difference . 	0
WD	348	So whoever this lady is saying parents are Bad for sending them to private should bite her tongue . 	0
WD	349	Hence , I switched to Private . . . . 	0
WD	350	That ' s still a baby ! 	0
WD	351	But I think I ' ll just keep him with me until SK and then let him go . 	0
WD	352	Why is it called redshirting , I wonder ? 	0
WD	353	My son was born in December ( cut-off Dec . 31 ) and I have been a little worried for him because they would want him to start JK when he ' s only 3 ! 	0
WD	354	( physically he ' s an ox , takes after my side of the family ! ) 	0
WD	355	Besides , you need to think of the kid ' s future . 	0
WD	356	I ' m not pleased with the full-day kindergarten coming in , but I ' ll worry about that when it gets closer . 	0
WD	357	( he ' s 2 now ) I thought of holding him back , but my husband was always bored in school and so if he ' s smart like his daddy it might actually work out very well for him to be a bit younger than the other kids . 	0
WD	358	If all the others are graduating high school at 17 , why does he need to be there until he ' s 18 ? 	0
WD	359	His whole life is delayed by a year . 	0
WD	360	My In our state , we have one of the youngest start ages ( 5 by Dec 31st ) . 	0
WD	361	I think it ' s a desperate shame - the poor kid is being deprived of an education and the opportunity to mix with other children . 	0
WD	362	Mine went to Public in Florida in Kindergarten and 1st and were coloring all day and playing computer games , and 1 / 2 the class did not speak English , in the same class ! 	0
WD	363	Kim 	0
WD	364	lurker here . . there is only mainstreaming where I live in Canada . . ALL special needs not matter what the handicap is . . or how severe go into regualr classes . . they do go to assisted learning classes for about 1 hr / day to get help w / reading etc . . this works awesome ! ! . . 	1
WD	365	I have a HF autistic son w / severe ADHD . . he is doing awesome in grade 1 he has a 1 on 1 aide in the class . . we feel well supported by the school system and he has only 18 in his class ! 	0
WD	366	Having sent my children to both public and private schools , I prefer private schools . 	1
WD	367	I say " NOT " ! 	0
WD	368	I think it is a very loving thing , a good and decent thing to send children to a private school ! 	1
WD	369	Give Me A Break ! 	0
WD	370	Bad people . . . 	0
WD	371	This statement . . . “ There are a lot of reasons why bad people send their kids to private school , ” Benedikt wrote . . . . is absolutely a lie ! 	0
WD	372	You say she has a compelling argument . . . 	0
WD	373	I know we all have to work extra hard to keep these private schools running and that is also teaching our children persistence . . . and how to care for one another without depending on Uncle Sam to come in and pick up the pieces . . . are you kidding me by judging all parents who know and believe in a Higher Power than themselves . . . now that is a refreshing statement for Ms . Benedikt to mull over along with all of her secular ideas that the public school system is pumping into our children . 	0
WD	374	I would like to say that the programs that the public schools are pushing are " bad " and teaching children to become more dependant upon our government where private schools teach self responsibility and good character . . . how dare this person call us bad if we chose to use our private schools . . . as a parent of a terrific private school system . . . 	0
WD	375	Do we still not live in the free United States of America ? ? ? 	0
WD	376	Private schools , producing more 1-dimensional bigots with an overblown sense of self-entitlement than any other education option . . . #Rex , Of which most of them become either lawyers or politicians . 	0
WD	377	Test scores would be an astoundingly poor way to judge the merits of single-sex education anyway . 	0
WD	378	I went to school with boys but somehow I managed to see myself as a human being and to retain higher goals than being pretty . 	0
WD	379	Succeeding in life is the goal . 	0
WD	380	Testing well is not the goal . 	0
WD	381	Maybe half of boys and half of girls would do better in a competitive atmosphere , and the same in a collaborative one . 	0
WD	382	Even if it were a good idea to separate children by learning style , one could not reasonably infer a child ' s learning style from their genitalia . 	0
WD	383	To everyone who thinks girls are better off in single-sex schools so that they don ' t invest time in being sexually desirable to men , I would note that we might be better off working toward a society where girls don ' t see themselves as sex objects , rather than designing institutions that say , " we think you can ' t learn around boys because you would have to spend so much time being a sex object . " 	0
WD	384	But that still would not mean that society would benefit from children being spoon-fed in homogeneous groups when the real world is diverse and demands adaptation . 	0
WD	385	Ms . Wong , Benedikt ' s reason is in no-way-shape-or-from compelling . 	0
WD	386	It ' s a self confessed a manifesto . 	0
WD	387	It requires a jaundiced eye . 	0
WD	388	While I ' m all for public schools ; both our kids attend . 	1
WD	389	Or being bested by her . 	0
WD	390	I shudder to imagine the losses we ' d suffer in reducing the gender gap in the remaining boys ' clubs like engineering and high level business management if women had to deal with men who had never in their lives had the experience of cooperating with a woman . 	0
WD	391	American parents have never given up their right to find the best solution for their child nor should they . 	0
WD	392	In the grey world , it ' s perfectly possible to believe-in and support public school but choose a private school for your student . 	0
WD	393	She may be advanced academically , but kindy is full day and she is just not ready for that , maturity-wise . 	0
WD	394	The school is having her wait , and I am 100% fine with that . 	0
WD	395	If a young five is already reading and doing basic math , they can continue to develop those skills at home for another year . 	0
WD	396	That ' s what we are doing . 	0
WD	397	She can keep doing her thing at home another year , and do half day preschool . 	0
WD	398	They will find ways to challenge her , the curriculum is designed to accomodate all skill levels . 	0
WD	399	Is the government supposed to say , OK , we just abandon home-educated kids to the whims of their parents ? 	0
WD	400	I encourage everybody I know to send their children to private school . 	1
WD	401	Okay , if I had children now they would go to private school . 	1
WD	402	I am a police officer and work part time at a private school and the attitude there is totally different . 	0
WD	403	The kids there are very respectful and so far no one asked about my gun . 	0
WD	404	If I go into a public school they ask about your gun and half the time while we are there , we are arresting someone . 	0
WD	405	That ' s not a favour , in my opinion . 	0
WD	406	: P ( surely you don ' t get marks in Kindergarten ? 	0
WD	407	I have no idea . ) 	0
WD	408	Now I am extremely confident and star in theatre performances , school choir , am going to take ABRSM Grade 7 for Piano , perfected the AMC 8 , and am taking Pre-Calculus . 	0
WD	409	So what about being a year older than my classmates ? 	0
WD	410	I think you should “ redshirt ” your son , no offense . 	1
WD	411	I am a 12-year-old 6th grader turning 13 in May , so I know what it ’ s like . 	0
WD	412	Here is my experience and I hope it will help you with your decision : In preschool , I had some issues , just like your son . 	0
WD	413	Yes , I knew my ABCs since 2 , just like him . 	0
WD	414	I feel socially confident now , and feel great ( except when I got 91 . 5 / 150 on AMC 10 and 76 . 5 / 150 on AMC 12- I have extremely high standards for myself ) . 	0
WD	415	Being at the top of the class is awesome . 	0
WD	416	I ' ll make sure to remind the teacher of his tender years if he starts getting poor marks for " scissoring skills " . 	0
WD	417	If you in Cape Town and your child loves playing cricket , send him to Wynberg boys high ! 	0
WD	418	what a terrific school it is ! 	0
WD	419	There are many parents who attend my church who send their children to public schools to attain essential knowledge that they will need to find a job or go on to college . 	0
WD	420	The life lessons learned from interacting with the opposite sex would be the winner for me . 	0
WD	421	So in Columbus , Ohio if you can ' t afford private school move to the suburbs . 	0
WD	422	Most public schools especially those that are intercity are not good . 	0
WD	423	Boys are also able to focus better during their puberity stages without the distraction of girls and the urges their hormones tend to trigger . 	0
WD	424	I wish I had moved sooner , but if I could have afforded private school my son would have gone . 	0
WD	425	I even could read music and knew my multiplication tables and could add and subtract 3-digit numbers ( not to brag , but you know what I mean ) . 	0
WD	426	However , I was behind socially ; I couldn ’ t stand up for myself without swearing ( actually using the f-word and such ) , I refused to ask for help , so I was redshirted . 	0
WD	427	Intentionally and explicitly working to turn out strong , capable , assertive women , Ellis--its heritage , its excellent teachers , and its visionary leadership--is all about helping girls find and build on their strengths and passions . 	0
WD	428	Ellis makes no apologies for its commitment to the growth of girls and young women as a single-sex school , and its palpable ethos had me wishing I had a daughter to send there . 	0
WD	429	Although Im pretty sure someone will scream about how dare I assume they ' re abusive etc . . . 	0
WD	430	But you either have some checking of child welfare or none . 	0
WD	431	I ' ve obviously not got the answers ! 	0
WD	432	Most boys ' schools have long since stopped selling themselves as bastions of male hegemony and cut-it-with-a-knife testosterone culture . 	0
WD	433	The gap is even wider with boys vs girls because of maturity levels . 	0
WD	434	The gap then continues to get wider due to confidence issues . 	0
WD	435	I teach middle school and see a HUGE difference in abilities between the younger and older kids . 	0
WD	436	I held her back . 	0
WD	437	My daughter was born on the cut off date . 	0
WD	438	There have been a lot of studies that show people born later in the year ( March ) are more successful in life due to the age gap . 	0
WD	439	This was promising to see . 	0
WD	440	Another promising skill I saw was when he was stuck on a word , he remembered he wrote it previously and therefore looked back at the word to help him spell it again . 	0
WD	441	He wanted all the action to start at the beginning and with all his ideas the characters were being sent in every direction possible . 	0
WD	442	However , he had no idea how to start the beginning of his narrative and what the structure of a narrative is , with the orientation beginning the narrative and the complication following . 	0
WD	443	This is quite interesting as it demonstrates that he is still at that level of a kindergarten / yr 1 student , being able to verbally produce a sentence however , not write it down exactly . 	0
WD	444	From this , even though his structuring was slightly off track he was able to verbally produce some great sentences however , forgot them for when he had to write them down . 	0
WD	445	I thought I would add this piece in to help develop an understanding of the difficulties one child has and the significant disadvantage he has academically . 	0
WD	446	As previously mentioned in my last blog ( Weekly reflection 2 ) I was working individually with a child with significant learning difficulties . 	0
WD	447	What I did notice whilst I was working with him was that at first he had absolutely no idea of what to write and me not knowing the movie did not help either but once I asked him to retell me what happened in the movie and started giving him some ideas he thought of his own and from there had some great ideas . 	0
WD	448	He spends a lot of time out of class with the special education teachers receiving one on one work but missing out on other important activities . 	0
WD	449	always have been whether it be Catholic school or Christian school . 	0
WD	450	private schools will always be around . 	0
WD	451	if you can ' t teach then someone will take notice . 	0
WD	452	I also agree God should have never came out of the schools . 	0
WD	453	if they can ' t provide , you can ' t teach . 	0
WD	454	If you can afford to send your kids to private schools do . 	1
WD	455	My son went to Columbus Public Schools , in Columbus , Ohio and they treated him and myself badly . 	0
WD	456	I was constantly in the school and very involved in his education . 	0
WD	457	It made no difference . 	0
WD	458	They didn ' t want my help or my commitment to the school . 	0
WD	459	I moved to the suburbs and the education in our suburban public schools are good the teachers were better and they appreciated my involvement . 	0
WD	460	if you don ' t like the way the public schools are then elect better leaders . 	0
WD	461	don ' t try to make parents feel guilty about it . 	0
WD	462	it is what it is . 	0
WD	463	In 2013 , the world is decidedly different , and the battles are far less obscure . 	0
WD	464	Colleges wrestle explicitly with how to combat " rape culture , " and events like the Steubenville trial generate national conversations around how our society fosters gender-role development . 	0
WD	465	I had never really thought what it might be like to work in an all-female environment , stuck firmly at the bottom of a ladder , and so my summers there were a revelation . 	0
WD	466	Not the least part of the revelation involved my discovery that the young leaders of the camp , members of the first generation of late-20th-century feminists , were pretty serious about using the camp experience--sailing , biking , swimming , and lots of group activities--as leadership development . 	0
WD	467	I also learned the hard way not to step into problem-solving roles until I was asked to , and I saw that younger campers idolized the competence of their counselors as much as they loved their warmth and enthusiasm . 	0
WD	468	The task of female role models and mentors was changing , and the staff was up to the work . 	0
WD	469	I also discovered what " collaborative leadership " meant , as the administrative staff--led by a superb director not long out of college herself--talked things over and made decisions in ways that sounded way more like what Chris Argyris had been talking about in his myth-shattering Organizational Behavior course that year than the autocratic , just-follow-me style I had imbibed from television , movies , and high school . 	0
WD	470	If summers found me in a land of strong and independent women , my first three teaching jobs ( my fourth has been in a decidedly coed environment ) were back in a man ' s world . 	0
WD	471	I think many of my generation of male teachers , with varying experiences navigating the waters of what the news magazines assured us was a Feminist Revolution , had been chastened more than a little on the meaning of masculinity and manhood , and so we did our best to tame our little corners of school environments that occasionally evoked Lord of the Flies ; gently mocked as Sensitive New Age Guys , we tried to help our male students exchange bluster and boisterousness for an occasional listen and maybe even the occasional tear . 	0
WD	472	I don ' t know how well it worked , but we felt we were doing our small part to win obscure battles in the most remote fields of that revolution . 	0
WD	473	I wouldn ' t send my dog to public schools in Florida . 	1
WD	474	I rose up to make changes . . . rose up to my feet and walked my family the hell out of a corrupt , unsafe , government battle ground and into the Private Catholic school system . 	0
WD	475	After all , it ’ s usually the parents who rise up to make changes to the system . . " 	0
WD	476	" . . . 	0
WD	477	If you fail to get your kids educated in our SHARED knowledge base to a high school level , you are guilty of child abuse . 	0
WD	478	I am sorry , I am a hardliner on this . 	0
WD	479	All schools should be accredited by at least the state level government and you should not be legally allowed to drop out until you are 16 years old . 	0
WD	480	You are assigning your kids to a life of poverty , opening them up to abuse and cutting them off from their potential . 	0
WD	481	I went there in 2009 with my highschool in a cricket tour . . . i went to rondebosch , sacs / sax ( forgot ) , wynberg and another school that i cant remember model c or private school is your best bet ! 	1
WD	482	make sure however , you send your kid to extra tuitions after school for problem subjects because i can safely say that when i was in school , sports was more important rather than academics . . . everyone wants to be 1st team in cricket , soccer and rugby 	0
WD	483	If the child has support throughout all of his schooling life , I see why not . 	1
WD	484	So the question is … should a child who has such significant learning difficulties be in a mainstream classroom ? 	1
WD	485	I do believe that all students have the right to a good education and although this child is at a low academic level , he still participates in class when prompted and the other students in the class still communicate and play with him even though he is significantly behind academically . 	0
WD	486	He has no behaviour problems and no physical demands that will affect other students in the classroom . 	0
WD	487	He still has one on one time with the special education teacher and is receiving great help from his class teacher now and from his peers . 	0
WD	488	If this child was to be in a special school / support unit the social skills he has now would be diminished and he may be at an even lower level than he is now as there are more interruptions than in a mainstream class . 	0
WD	489	When I taught in NYC before NCLB , students were leveled off to their level and abilities so children can advance and not be waiting for others to catch up and learn English even . 	0
WD	490	For a critical mass families and kids , some period of single-sex education is part of a path toward an adulthood informed in positive ways by an understanding of both the differences between the sexes and the ways in which we are all bound by our shared and very human anxieties , aspirations , and capacities . 	0
WD	491	All you commies out there can shove it right up your A$$ ! 	0
WD	492	I ' m talking black , white , brown , asian , oriental , you name it they ' ve got it . 	0
WD	493	So you won ' t get your undies in a bunch , the young people graduating from this school are from accross the race spectrum . 	0
WD	494	That ' s unheard of in public schools . 	0
WD	495	We have a local private High school who turns out bright talented young people . 	0
WD	496	No amount of parent involvement is going to solve those problems . 	0
WD	497	With a plethora of drugs and gang problems , public schools are the LAST place I would send my child ! 	1
WD	498	I would not having a problem sending mine to public if they were learning . 	0
WD	499	We have a few thousand years of evidence for how poorly men treat women when women are excluded from male institutions . 	0
WD	500	Actually he ' s much bigger than most kids so it seems unlikely . 	0
WD	501	They get a better education and they are safer from acts of violence . 	0
WD	502	Public schools have become more interested in political correctness than in education and there is too little control over violence . 	0
WD	503	Boys tend to play and act up less when girls are not around , and they ' re less inclined to show off and seek attention . 	0
WD	504	Girls on the other hand do not benfit as much from same sex schools as boys . 	0
WD	505	Girls tend to achieve as well in both mixed and same sex environments . 	0
WD	506	Not a problem . 	0
WD	507	I can also speak from my experiences as qualified teacher and child psyc . 	0
WD	508	Same sex education works best for males . 	0
WD	509	Boys tend to obtain better grades and have less disciplinary issues in same sex schools . 	0
WD	510	That said all the above are generalisations and atypical results , doesn ' t mean they apply or are relavent to your daughter . 	0
WD	511	My personal opinion : If your daughter is on the fence about it , i personally would go for the co ed school assuming its facilities , teachers , and resources are equal to that of the same sex . 	1
WD	512	Education is far too important to let the government do it . 	0
WD	513	It is wrong to send a child to government schools . 	1
WD	514	Whew ! 	0
WD	515	Just know He will judge the wicked . 	0

WD	517	you can demand all you want , but unless you have a school system that worthy of sending any child too , then it ' s all for not . 	0
WD	518	teachers claim they are not paid enough . 	0
WD	519	if that means sending them to private school , then so be it . 	0
WD	520	no difference in home schooling . 	0
WD	521	you had to research it before you decided that would be your major ? 	0
WD	522	you say you have to spend your own money for supplies . 	0
WD	523	well , excuse me , but you did know that before you decided to become a teacher . 	0
WD	524	you had to intern somewhere ? 	0
WD	525	It ' s a crappy situation , and god help any social worker who haves to work that one case , because they ' re not even walking a thin line anymore , they ' re trying to dance between the clouds of child protection and respect of parental care . 	0
WD	526	So many abuse cases show few warning signs while they occur ( the ones we hear about in the press tend to be more gory or shocking than the majority ) , and sadly even if a child is watched by social carers for 23 hours and 59 minutes a day , a determined abuser will wait till the last minute . 	0
WD	527	And while of course the vast majority of people who home educate won ' t be using it as an excuse to hide the abuse of their children , there will be someone somewhere who does , and if and when that occurs the media frenzy and search for blame will occur . 	0
WD	528	However . . . 	0
WD	529	Removal of a child from established programs and situations ( such as state education ) will always raise a question mark in these times . 	0
WD	530	why ? 	0
WD	531	demand the school provide . 	0
WD	532	Even the best public schools cannot reach every student all of the time . 	0
WD	533	Additionally , American families hold a plethora of educational positions and beliefs that might move them to choose a private school . 	0
WD	534	she is obviously a liberal . 	0
WD	535	only a liberal buys into the if you make more money you have to give to the poor mindset . 	0
WD	536	what she fails to recognize is , the more money you have , the more you give to charity . 	0
WD	537	you donate your time , you give away clothing / shoes / coats to the needy , you assist with fundraisers to raise money for the poor whether it be for school supplies , food banks , etc . 	0
WD	538	people with money give more . 	0
WD	539	simple as that . 	0
WD	540	you don ' t need to take additional tax dollars to prove that . 	0
WD	541	i live in an area ( Georgia ) where there is no way in h*ll i would send my kid to a public school here . 	1
WD	542	it is not safe , the teachers are cheating and it is riddled with gang activity . 	0
WD	543	sending a child whose parents have money to a private school doesn ' t mean they are bad parents , it simply means they want more for their child . 	0
WD	544	Of course , turning up late for a doctors appointment for your child will also raise a question mark , but generally these things mean nothing in isolation ( an A&E visit with a child will gain a mark , but you ' ll need a fair few before anyone pays any attention to it ) . 	0

WD	546	I don ' t agree with overprotectiveness but I do agree with parents doing their jobs . 	0
WD	547	Being parents . 	0
WD	548	" To control the future requires the control of education and of the child . 	0
WD	549	Hence , for Christians to tolerate statist education , or to allow their children to be trained thereby , means to renounce power in society , to renounce their children , and to deny Christ ' s Lordship over all of life . ” 	0
WD	550	My other friend is super-mega smart and got a fantastic education . 	0
WD	551	She ended up going to be a Missionary / English teacher . 	0
WD	552	Her sister , in college now , and she ' s such a sweet person . 	0
WD	553	None of my friends or siblings are messed up , because they have been taught well . 	0
WD	554	There will be reprecusions for the choices that have been made without God . 	0
WD	555	But do remember – God is not mocked . 	0
WD	556	Every knee shall bow , and every tongue will confess the Jesus Christ is Lord . 	0
WD	557	This country in now the most liberal county , we allow everything to go . 	0
WD	558	After all that God has done to make this the richest land ever , this is how we show our thanks . 	0
WD	559	I too believed that out nation is under a great fall due taking prayer out of schools and attempting to take God out of everything we do . 	0
WD	560	Our country has lost morales and respect for God . 	0
WD	561	His mum doesn ' t send him to school because she worries he ' ll get bullied . 	0
WD	562	Boys were beastly enough without the distraction of girls , and the educational needs of girls were thought to diverge from those of boys even before puberty brought its complications . 	0
WD	563	Early advocates of coeducation like Bronson Alcott were thought to be batty . 	0
WD	564	While the debate goes on about the legitimacy of single-sex classes and schools in the public sector , private and independent schools keep taking the concept to whole new levels . 	0
WD	565	Once upon a time coeducation was unthinkable . 	0
WD	566	As a kid I experienced both single-sex and coeducational schools . 	0
WD	567	My public elementary school was coed , of course , and then I had six years of boys-only junior and senior high school . 	0
WD	568	Plenty of progressive educators and theorists have since laid to rest most of the traditional concerns and fears of coeducation skeptics . 	0
WD	569	Public schools have been coed for a long time , and old schoolhouses with separate " Boys " and " Girls " entrances are quaint in a way that makes us shake our heads . 	0
WD	570	Then followed a couple of years of all-male university , until we were happily rolled over by the tidal wave of vintage 1970 coeducation , leaving the president to figure out how to keep his promise that we ' d produce " a thousand male leaders " every year ; so was born the cramped room students call a " forced triple . " 	0
WD	571	As at many all-male institutions , the arrival of women didn ' t make a huge dent in the culture right away , and so it when I found myself the lone male at a girls ' summer camp ( the maintenance guy , often reeking slightly of rotting garbage ) I experienced culture shock . 	0
WD	572	I know one " home-educated " kid . 	0
WD	573	I ' m not a fan of the nanny state , but I can see why the government is doing this . 	0
WD	574	The trouble is , home schooling can be a cover for all sorts of undesirable stuff . 	0
WD	575	I don ' t want to be the hate figure here , but home schooling is probably always going to be the subject of some suspicion purely because any possible abuse wouldn ' t be able to be reported by any other pupils or teachers . 	0
WD	576	As far as I can tell , the education he receives at home is pretty minimal - nothing like what you ' d get in school . 	0
WD	577	And yeah , I agree that people shouldn ' t be automatically deisgnated as suspects for child abuse simply because they decide on home teaching . 	0
WD	578	I ’ m ready . 	0
WD	579	People generally do this because they want what is best for their children . 	0
WD	580	For example , religion is a good thing . . . the public school does not believe in that . . . . . 	0
WD	581	Lady , you need to get your head out of your *ss . 	0
WD	582	There are plenty of good reasons for sending my kids to private school , and guess what , they are none of your business but here are a few . 	1
WD	583	The government has proven over and over that they can not be trusted to do the right thing and I am not going to let them take over my child ' s education . 	0
WD	584	By the way , last time I checked , we are not in Cuba . 	0
WD	585	Christmas is usually referred to as the ' Winter Festival . ' 	0
WD	586	Additionally , I don ' t want my child indoctrinated with leftist liberal crap . 	0
