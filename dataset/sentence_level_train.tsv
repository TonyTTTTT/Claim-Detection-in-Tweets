MT	0	US series are preferred over “ Tatort ” , and online magazines are turned to instead of the “ Tagesthemen ” . 	0
MT	1	The TV & radio licence enables economically independent journalism . 	0
MT	2	Not everyone should be obliged to pay the TV & radio licence . 	1
MT	3	Particularly the younger generations are no longer dependent on the programming of public broadcasters . 	0
MT	4	But as long as the licence payers have no say in the distribution of the funds , the fee quite rightly annoys them . 	0
MT	5	There should be much higher fines for dog dirt left on pavements . 	1
MT	6	Stepping in dog dirt is gross and absolutely ruins your day due to the dirt , the stench and the often considerable effort to get rid of it . 	0
MT	7	Besides , the fines for public urination by a human are higher than for leaving behind dog dirt on the pavement , which is disproportionate . 	0
MT	8	Some dog owners assume that paying a dog licence fee covers the removal of such waste , but according to this logic one could hardly make the taxpayer accountable for almost any offense . 	0
MT	9	Since the impact of the morning-after pill is so massive , particularly due to its abortive effect , dispensing it without medical advice would be inappropriate . 	1
MT	10	Easy access to the morning-after pill could also result in its appearing to be an easier method than other forms of contraception that , however , have fewer health effects . 	0
MT	11	The state ought not to restrict medical products or medical treatments for moral reasons as long as they don ' t do damage to others . 	0
MT	12	But without a prescription requirement there ' s also no medical advice given before intake . 	0
MT	13	For instance the morning-after pill could result in a decrease in the use of condoms and thus lead to an increase in new infections with Aids . 	0
MT	14	Three different bin bags stink away in the kitchen and have to be sorted into different wheelie bins . 	0
MT	15	Yes , it ' s annoying and cumbersome to separate your rubbish properly all the time . 	0
MT	16	We Berliners should take the chance and become pioneers in waste separation ! 	1
MT	17	But still Germany produces way too much rubbish and too many resources are lost when what actually should be separated and recycled is burnt . 	0
MT	18	Moreover it turns out time and again that innocent people are also convicted and executed . 	0
MT	19	From a Christian and humanistic perspective it is not allowed to kill someone . 	0
MT	20	The death penalty should be abandoned everywhere . 	1
MT	21	However also the threat of the death penalty in the respective countries apparently cannot prevent murder and violent crime . 	0
MT	22	Proponents of the death penalty count on its deterring effect as well as the ultimate elimination of any potential threat . 	0
MT	23	Throughout the six or seven semesters , however , topics are covered that likewise ought to carry weight . 	0
MT	24	Usually you only have eight weeks to complete a bachelor thesis in linguistics degrees . 	0
MT	25	Adjusting the portion of the total grade upwards anyway would not be commensurate to other study assignments and examinations . 	0
MT	26	Current regulations for the calculation of the total grade should therefore be maintained . 	1
MT	27	Indeed the preparation of such a scientific work is a fundamental competency that must be acquired in philological degrees . 	0
MT	28	In individual cases they may indeed act as a deterrent , in general , however , a clean environment and the role model effect of others is more likely to motivate the dog owner to pick up the droppings than a potential fine . 	0
MT	29	Higher penalties for dog dirt are pointless as long as there is not enough personnel to enforce them . 	1
MT	30	That ' s why intelligence services must be regulated in the framework of parliamentary oversight committees . 	1
MT	31	Of course a certain level of secrecy is the basis for the work of intelligence services . 	0
MT	32	The unregulated work of the secret services , however , carries the danger of misuse of their authority . 	0
MT	33	Intelligence services apparently enjoy indiscriminate liberties . 	0
MT	34	No one can follow their activities in detail . 	0
MT	35	Higher fines may not be ideal , particularly for financially weaker individuals , but cleaning up after their dogs does happen to be the obligation of the owners . 	0
MT	36	If there were higher fines for leaving dog dirt on pavements , there would presumably be less dog dirt , which in turn would result in generally clean pavements . 	1
MT	37	Every German citizen has a right to education . 	0
MT	38	Quality at universities has its price , which is why students also ought to be involved in this cost factor . 	0
MT	39	But education must not be a question of money in a wealthy society such as Germany . 	0
MT	40	Therefore universities should not charge tuition fees in Germany . 	1
MT	41	And funding-wise it ought to be considered how costs incurred by students from other ( federal ) states can be reimbursed . 	0
MT	42	The anticipated objectives of tuition fees can be achieved by other means . 	0
MT	43	There are other instruments to motivate tighter discipline while studying . 	0
MT	44	The universities in Germany should not under any circumstances charge tuition fees . 	1
MT	45	This would impede or prevent access to those who are financially weaker . 	0
MT	46	Considering what ' s on television these days , it would be appropriate to only have those people pay who actually ( want to ) follow the programming . 	1
MT	47	In some cases there are only shows for older generations on at prime times , so why then should everyone pay for this ? 	0
MT	48	By now you have advertising on all channels , so there ' s no advantage for the current paying viewers of the public broadcasters . 	0
MT	49	Nevertheless one has to point out that there ' d probably be way fewer stations if it weren ’ t the whole of Germany that ’ s obliged to pay . 	0
MT	50	The steering system may still need a bit of tweaking , as the car jack-knifes at higher speeds , and surely you ' ll want to be speeding a lot with that beauty . 	0
MT	51	Plus everyone has to move approx . 3-10 times in his or her life , because the size of the desired accommodation changes over the course of a lifetime . 	0
MT	52	For affordable living space is scarce . 	0
MT	53	Pricing pressures are just too high , and his pool of customers is shrinking constantly . 	0
MT	54	Peter should close his snack bar as soon as possible . 	1
MT	55	Of course he could do another big ad campaign , but that won ' t do the trick if the whole neighbourhood is going down the drain in the end . 	0
MT	56	Higher fines are therefore the right measure against negligent , lazy or simply thoughtless dog owners . 	1
MT	57	Of course , first they ' d actually need to be caught in the act by public order officers , but once they have to dig into their pockets , their laziness will sure vanish ! 	0
MT	58	One can hardly move in Friedrichshain or Neukölln these days without permanently scanning the ground for dog dirt . 	0
MT	59	And when bad luck does strike and you step into one of the many ' land mines ' you have to painstakingly scrape the remains off your soles . 	0
MT	60	Even if many people think that a murderer has already decided on the life or death of another person , this is precisely the crime that we should not repay with the same . 	0
MT	61	The death penalty is a legal means that as such is not practicable in Germany . 	1
MT	62	For one thing , inviolable human dignity is anchored in our constitution , and furthermore no one may have the right to adjudicate upon the death of another human being . 	0
MT	63	But once a safeguard has been found against a new virus , everyone gets it in no time through the automatic update . 	0
MT	64	Admittedly they do not generally prevent you from catching a virus , since they can only react to publicly known threats . 	0
MT	65	That ' s why everyone should have an anti-virus programme on his or her Windows machine . 	1
MT	66	Anti-virus software protects the users of a computer from dangers from the internet . 	0
MT	67	These areas will be upgraded economically due to these factors ( housing health and employment ) . 	0
MT	68	After the new BER Airport has been commissioned , Tegel should definitely be closed . 	1
MT	69	Also , Berlin urgently needs inner-city areas for business and industry , and for housing . 	0
MT	70	Closing down Tegel will have health benefits for hundreds of thousands in the approach path . 	0
MT	71	I think Berlin with its two inner-city airports was lucky not having to experience an airplane catastrophe for decades . 	0
MT	72	For safety reasons alone I find continued operation wrong . 	0
MT	73	The danger here is that experienced junior staff is not available in sufficient numbers . 	0
MT	74	By purchasing illegally acquired tax data of citizens , the state is not only turning itself into a felon , but it is paying criminals , too . 	0
MT	75	It is indisputable , however , that by purchasing such data the state increases the pressure on tax evaders to turn themselves in . 	0
MT	76	Acquiring CDs with tax data of tax delinquents is therefore out of the question . 	1
MT	77	I am not of the opinion that the retirement age should be set at 63 years . 	1
MT	78	This would mean that organizations would be lacking a great deal of manpower in the future . 	0
MT	79	The introductory phase of retirement at 63 would also be a particular challenge as upon introduction many current employees of advanced age would immediately be eligible to retire . 	0
MT	80	This is detrimental for Germany as a business location and leaves employers without a transition period . 	0
MT	81	The morning-after pill should only be prescribed after counselling by a physician or pharmacist . 	1
MT	82	However these are clearly stated on the package insert , and a request for an early termination of a pregnancy is the right of every woman . 	0
MT	83	A differentiated analysis of its side effects is not achievable for a layperson without medical advice . 	0
MT	84	The morning-after pill has a number of side effects . 	0
MT	85	Opening on Sundays and holidays would therefore help both customers and shops . 	1
MT	86	Owner-run shops may potentially be overwhelmed by additional work times on Sundays and holidays , then again supermarkets and large shopping centres dominate the market today already . 	0
MT	87	Thus smaller shops could benefit from the additional freedom , as customers are on average more laid-back on Sunday . 	0
MT	88	Due to the many random factors the bachelor thesis should not play a bigger role . 	1
MT	89	But one can make occasional mistakes in the thesis . 	0
MT	90	The bachelor thesis reflects both the content and the methods of the topics covered during a degree programme . 	0
MT	91	A good grade for the thesis also significantly depends on the supervision of a dedicated teacher . 	0
MT	92	If this carries more weight , many good individual assignments done during the course of study may be obscured . 	0
MT	93	Also the scripts are often copied off each other . 	0
MT	94	For those people the late opening hours , which meanwhile already extend to 12 : 00 midnight , present a good alternative . 	0
MT	95	It was clearly a mistake to include Tom in our football team . 	1
MT	96	He ' s just not a team player , and often goes it alone . 	0
MT	97	Plus he comes to training way too rarely , although he plays very well without training . 	0
MT	98	But the worst thing is his habit of always complaining to the referee . 	0
MT	99	Schweinsteiger has now been injured for three days . 	0
MT	100	We urgently need a midfield replacement for the coming match . 	1
MT	101	The doctor was able to sign him off as fit for play with enough painkillers , but that would only make the injury worse in the long run . 	0
MT	102	And a young substitute always invigorates the team . 	0
MT	103	Of course a higher federal subsidy would be even better for Berlin ' s coffers , but you shouldn ' t bother hoping for that . 	0
MT	104	Hence the Mayor of Berlin ought to keep the hurdles for organizing such events as low as possible . 	1
MT	105	Large events that stir national or even international attention attract many visitors , and nothing will get Berlin out of its financial jam more than a lot of spending visitors . 	0
MT	106	If you dispose of the waste then and there yourself , no fine is necessary . 	0
MT	107	Also children , adults and other animals aren ' t allowed to leave droppings on the pavement . 	0
MT	108	Dog dirt is disgusting and a hygiene problem . 	0
MT	109	There should be a higher fine for dog dirt on the pavement . 	1
MT	110	Unfortunately this can lead to disagreeable dependencies in some cases . 	0
MT	111	Universities are for all citizens , independent of their finances . 	0
MT	112	Tuition fees should not generally be charged by universities . 	1
MT	113	If a university lacks the funds , sponsors must be found . 	0
MT	114	Education and training are fundamental rights which the state , the society must provide . 	0
MT	115	My parents say this could also be pure coincidence . 	0
MT	116	But that much of a coincidence is simply impossible . 	0
MT	117	Freddy and I must be siblings . 	1
MT	118	We both have the exact same two moles on our left arm and you only get that with siblings . 	0
MT	119	That shouldn ' t be an issue though , given the sheer number of programmes and stations that essentially show the same things anyway . 	0
MT	120	They do offer the benefit that the competition over brand-name clothes and the discrimination of the socially weak are prevented . 	0
MT	121	School uniforms should not be worn in our schools . 	1
MT	122	Plus such uniforms also stand for ideological conformity and for the suppression of individual self-development . 	0
MT	123	Nevertheless hardly anyone wishes to dress themselves or their children in a standard uniform . 	0
MT	124	The EU should exert influence on the political events in Ukraine . 	1
MT	125	The developments in that conflict should not be left to former Cold War opponents alone , for that course can only lead to escalation in some form . 	0
MT	126	Furthermore , Ukraine is culturally and geographically much closer than other countries that the EU ( used to ) get involved with . 	0
MT	127	Indeed one could argue that a country has to deal with internal political changes itself , but political power also brings about political responsibility , in this case the responsibility to protect the Ukrainian people from the rather strong interests of the two Great Powers . 	0
MT	128	That the same actors time and again get to have a laugh at exotic shooting locations ? 	0
MT	129	What are you paying for , then ? 	0
MT	130	Curiously , however , there are still adverts and product placements on the public channels . 	0
MT	131	Actually only those people should pay a TV & radio licence fee who really watch ARD , ZDF , Arte etc . It is in fact good to support sophisticated programming through fees . 	1
MT	132	Our society is in danger of overheating due to ' never clocking off ' . 	0
MT	133	Even though politicians stress the Christian character of our country , the last 20 years have seen the Sunday off work increasingly sacrificed to commerce . 	0
MT	134	But after all , the purpose of having a day off is not just to make time to go to church . 	0
MT	135	Rather it should give people the chance to have a mental break . 	0
MT	136	That ' s why there ought to be one day a week when supermarkets and shopping centres stay closed . 	1
MT	137	Indeed , however , it ' s already the case today that students of apparently ' uniform-free ' schools are essentially wearing a uniform consisting of certain brand-name garments . 	0
MT	138	Some may find the idea of a school uniform anachronistic , or regard it as too much of an intervention into the leeway of students and parents to make decisions . 	0
MT	139	A simply designed practical outfit would even out the overall visual image of a school , and direct attention towards the character and achievements of the students - and not their buying power . 	1
MT	140	And yet now I ' ll actually have all the more time for them . 	0
MT	141	I ' m also tired of my data boosting the market value of that corporation . 	0
MT	142	Facebook warns me emphatically that I may lose contact with my friends . 	0
MT	143	Today I will delete my Facebook account . 	1
MT	144	Not only because I ' m constantly astonished about who wants to be my friend . 	0
MT	145	Besides , the purchase of such CDs is unnecessary today , as , due to changed terms of business , many banks urge their customers to turn themselves in . 	0
MT	146	Admittedly the number of immigrants is constantly rising in Germany , but without sufficient , well-qualified junior employees there is hardly a possibility for adequate pension financing . 	0
MT	147	The implementation of retirement at 63 is no longer socially sustainable , as the population in Germany has , viewed demographically , a disproportionate number of old people , and constantly declining birth rates are being recorded . 	1
MT	148	Because for one thing , their products will still sell in bad times , and in addition , such a share is not as sensitive as those of other IT companies . 	0
MT	149	Although IBM ' s numbers haven ' t been staggering recently , and the mood in the stock market could be better on the whole , you should buy IBM shares if you want to invest . 	1
MT	150	This is also more akin to the real working world later , where performance isn ' t singular , but constant and has to be delivered over longer periods . 	0
MT	151	The idea of the bachelor degree is to put together a cumulative grade from various individual assignments in order to generate a final grade . 	0
MT	152	However , the effort required for the individual equally weighted modules differs strongly . 	0
MT	153	That ' s why it makes sense that the bachelor thesis only makes up a relatively small portion of the final grade ( 15 out of 120 credits ) . 	0
MT	154	It would therefore be wise to adjust the required effort for final theses accordingly . 	1
MT	155	Energy saving light bulbs contain a significant amount of toxins . 	0
MT	156	A commercially available bulb may contain for example up to five milligrams of mercury . 	0
MT	157	That ' s why they should be taken off the market , unless they ' re unbreakable . 	1
MT	158	But precisely this is unfortunately not the case . 	0
MT	159	Both the drawn-out building operations and the mounting safety issues show clear shortcomings in the entire planning . 	0
MT	160	BER should be re-conceptualized from scratch , even if billions of Euros have already been invested in the existing airport project and this would delay the date of completion indefinitely . 	1
MT	161	Especially the home games have seen the team stay behind expectations . 	0
MT	162	Berlin ' s basketball team has just come out of a sobering season . 	1
MT	163	Indeed the team ended up third in the league , but given the cost of the star-players one could ' ve expected more . 	0
MT	164	A sad highlight : Losing 60 : 87 to the weakish Mannheimers in a sold-out stadium . 	0
MT	165	Humanity has made enough mistakes throughout history by waiting too long , and when it has finally reacted , the only remaining option has usually been war . 	0
MT	166	A violation of international law should be more than enough to consider a reaction ! 	0
MT	167	Since , however , in Russia besides gas and oil only propaganda and corruption rule , the EU should intervene right away . 	1
MT	168	It ' s to be noted that in our civilized world , in a democratic country , the people can determine their own fate , as long as the motivation of those people isn ' t triggered by propaganda , corruption and military pressure . 	0
MT	169	If however one could find a compromise between green space and housing , then Tempelhofer Feld should definitely be made available for residential construction . 	1
MT	170	Admittedly the fields have currently become an attractive leisure park with sporting areas for many visitors and Berliners , especially in spring and summer . 	0
MT	171	Since the area belongs to the federal state , or the federation , it could even be used for social housing with affordable rents . 	0
MT	172	For years there has been a housing shortage in Berlin , so that using Tempelhofer Feld , which offers a lot of open space and is currently hardly developed , as living space is a sensible idea . 	0
MT	173	But I want to experience this incredible moment of freedom that skydivers report time and again . 	0
MT	174	Besides , Jochen was given a parachute jump the other day as a gift , and it mustn ' t be that this wannabe-adventurer has one up on me . 	0
MT	175	Tomorrow I will skydive for the first time in my life . 	1
MT	176	Yes , there is a certain risk to life . 	0
MT	177	For dog dirt left on the pavement dog owners should by all means pay a bit more . 	1
MT	178	Indeed it ' s not the fault of the animals , but once you step in it , their excrement seems to stick rather persistently to your soles . 	0
MT	179	And many a video game is physically and particularly mentally more demanding , when I think of the last FIFA tournament ' s final , than kicking a ball 20 metres . 	0
MT	180	Plus the hurdle to make video games Olympic events is minimal , as you don ' t even need doping tests , only a neutral console . 	0
MT	181	Perhaps it is less thrilling for a spectator than for the player , but also for contemporary Olympic events , I recall curling and 50km cross-country skiing , you have to be more than a freak to follow those more properly than only in the roundup of highlights . 	0
MT	182	It would be fair to make them into an Olympic event . 	1
MT	183	Video games , namely FIFA in my case , can fascinate young people for hours more intensively and emotionally than any sport in the world ! 	0
MT	184	I find the peripheral housing development at Tempelhofer Feld right for urban planning reasons , as the area is right in the middle of the city ( capital ) . 	1
MT	185	The size of the field allows for both housing and generous open space . 	0
MT	186	A dog dirt-free city will be more attractive not only for its residents but also for tourists ! 	0
MT	187	Increasing penalties is therefore the right way . 	1
MT	188	A fine for leaving dog waste behind admittedly seems rather authoritarian , but similar rules are often in place for bicycles on park paths , after all . 	0
MT	189	Time and again children or the elderly slip on them . 	0
MT	190	Pieces of dog poo on the pavements are a real danger . 	0
MT	191	Complementary medicine includes treatments with proven health benefits in many areas which are often less costly than medication from conventional medicine , which are also paid for after all . 	0
MT	192	Often natural treatments do not put as much of a strain on the patient . 	0
MT	193	Such therapies can frequently result in an improvement in the condition through the active participation of the patient . 	0
MT	194	The health insurance companies ought to be enabled to recognize a doctor ' s decision for natural treatment and also to cover it . 	1
MT	195	For , due to the low birth rate , the proportion of the elderly population and with it pension costs are on the rise , and furthermore , due to today ' s healthcare most people in many occupations are fitter for work in old age than before . 	0
MT	196	Although the workload is getting heavier in many professions and physical and psychological wear on personnel is steadily increasing , the statutory retirement age should in the future not remain at 63 years . 	1
MT	197	Raising the relative retirement age on the basis of the physical fitness of the average citizen is fair . 	1
MT	198	Yet no one should be required to work for more than 40 years . 	0
MT	199	Thus social security and pension costs are increasing . 	0
MT	200	Germany ' s aging society is undergoing demographic change , and the age of those who are physically and mentally fit is increasing steadily . 	0
MT	201	If there must be rent increases , there should also be a cap to avoid nasty surprises . 	0
MT	202	Rent increases upon re-letting aren ' t bad as such , if it ' s only a small amount , With those kinds of amounts you think twice about whether you really want to stay in the flat . 	0
MT	203	That the landlords are then slightly restricted in the administration of their property is not a problem , as they have more pull in the end anyway . 	0
MT	204	This helps the landlords , as they can adjust their expenses through the increase , and also the tenants , as they can plan for a maximum rent increase . 	1
MT	205	they ’ re very bad however , if the rent suddenly climbs by €100 or €200 . 	0
MT	206	The prototype of Audi ' s new sports car has car lovers raving . 	1
MT	207	But aside from that the car caters to pretty much every wish . 	0
MT	208	People , however , who work during the week and on Saturdays then have a problem : everyone else can shop weekdays , but they can ' t . 	0
MT	209	Hence it is good when shops are not open on Sundays and public holidays . 	1
MT	210	Likewise public holidays should remain what they are : for some a day of introspection , for others a paid day off that is not taken away from the annual paid leave proper . 	0
MT	211	Supermarket employees and people who work in shopping centres also have the right to a Sunday off work . 	0
MT	212	One should not re-introduce capital punishment in Germany , since no one can claim the right to rule over the life or death of another human being . 	1
MT	213	Capital punishment will not deter anyone else from an atrocity . 	0
MT	214	Everyone must be given the chance to hone their conscience and possibly make amends for their deed . 	0
MT	215	Admittedly trash and turmoil are exactly what the majority of people want to see . 	0
MT	216	The thought of television exclusively made up of private channels scares me . 	0
MT	217	Only in public TV programmes can viewers get information that is not profit-oriented . 	0
MT	218	But to therefore offer TV according to audience rates only would be dangerous . 	0
MT	219	And since it is the duty of society to collectively finance certain areas that cannot hold their own in a market economy , everyone should chip in . 	1
MT	220	Plus , the state wants me to spend my money , and how am I supposed to do that when the shops aren ' t open when I ' m off work ? 	0
MT	221	Well , I as an employee find it very practical to be able to shop at least on weekends . 	1
MT	222	Sure , other people have to work in the shops on the weekend , but they can have days off during the week and run errands at their leisure while I ' m stuck in the office . 	0
MT	223	Health insurance companies should naturally cover alternative medical treatments . 	1
MT	224	Not all practices and approaches that are lumped together under this term may have been proven in clinical trials , yet it ' s precisely their positive effect when accompanying conventional ' western ' medical therapies that ' s been demonstrated as beneficial . 	0
MT	225	Besides many general practitioners offer such counselling and treatments in parallel anyway - and who would want to question their broad expertise ? 	0
MT	226	Some worry about careless use of such measures , but this problem should rather be addressed with comprehensive prior education . 	0
MT	227	The morning-after pill ought to be available over-the-counter in pharmacies . 	1
MT	228	Even with state-of-the-art contraceptives there can be mistakes and problems and an unwanted pregnancy can place a significant strain on both the parents and the child for the rest of their lives . 	0
MT	229	Considering their requirements , some video games are not relevant as sports , but this issue should be solvable through a clearly structured preselection process . 	0
MT	230	Various skills are promoted and required by different games , including planning abilities , reaction time , and reasoning to name but a few . 	0
MT	231	The performance often required by players is considerable and by all means comparable to physical efforts . 	0
MT	232	Video games ought to be included in the ranks of Olympic events . 	1
MT	233	In a few decades our society will have a disproportionate number of old people : the life expectancy is constantly rising , and at the same time birth rates are declining . 	1
MT	234	Although having children has become more fashionable again in recent years , these short-term fluctuations in birth rates don ' t change the general trend at all . 	0
MT	235	Voters have become more sceptical . 	0
MT	236	Too many promises have not been kept . 	0
MT	237	There are parliamentary elections soon and traditionally the governing party is generous with popular promises in the run-up to federal elections . 	0
MT	238	Nevertheless the head of government , Merkel , had better restrain herself in announcing handouts this year . 	1
MT	239	But what is the good of a wonderfully outfitted university if it doesn ' t actually allow the majority of clever people to broaden their horizons with all that great equipment ? 	0
MT	240	Even without tuition fees half of the student population has to work while studying and hence has less time for studying or recreation . 	0
MT	241	One could argue that an increase in tuition fees would allow institutions to be better equipped . 	0
MT	242	German universities should on no account charge tuition fees . 	1
MT	243	This would simply mean that only those people with wealthy parents or a previous education and a part-time job while studying would be able to apply for a degree programme in the first place . 	0
MT	244	The effectiveness of many natural remedies has not been demonstrated . 	0
MT	245	They should not be spent on personal preferences without proven use . 	0
MT	246	Yet the funds of the health insurance companies are a common benefit for all premium payers . 	0
MT	247	The choice of an attending physician is at the discretion of the patient . 	0
MT	248	Intelligence services should be more closely regulated by parliament , for , as the most recent NSA wiretapping scandal has shown , the federal state government is allegedly not always familiar with the scope of operations of its intelligence services . 	1
MT	249	Checks could contribute to restricting the so far rather opaque scope of action of individual services . 	0
MT	250	Yet it remains questionable whether the actual implementation of such supervision would at the same time lead to a stronger observance of laws , as ultimately this decision is in the hands of the respective government leaders . 	0
MT	251	Therefore no unproven and unrecognized treatments by naturopaths should be reimbursed by the insurance companies . 	1
MT	252	Retirement at 63 , that ' s something everyone who has toiled away ( nonstop ) up to this point surely deserves . 	0
MT	253	Only the question remains whether this early ' leisure ' will be nicer if you have no idea what do to all day and you statistically still have almost 20 ( ! ! ! ) years to go ? 	0
MT	254	Also , one isn ' t taking responsibility for society if one gives up one ' s experienced , healthy and highly qualified capabilities earlier than necessary for private / personal reasons . 	0
MT	255	Especially now , as there is a lack of skilled labour , it ' s irresponsible for the economy and prosperity to retire at 63 . 	1
MT	256	Always having to visit the doctor first ( including travel and waiting time , possible embarrassment , etc . ) leads to more unwanted pregnancies . 	0
MT	257	Many opponents of the pill point out that this does away with the consultation at the doctor ' s and many women take it unnecessarily . 	0
MT	258	Being a pharmacist myself , I argue categorically in favour of over-the-counter availability of the morning-after pill in pharmacies . 	1
MT	259	From a medical perspective the morning-after pill works best when taken as soon as possible after intercourse . 	0
MT	260	However , the fact is that we pharmacists are legally required to inform the patients and possess the same subject matter expertise as doctors . 	0
MT	261	But for snap shots that ' s still enough . 	0
MT	262	I can only recommend the new smartphone XYZ-123 to everyone . 	1
MT	263	Of course the camera could be better , as it only has mediocre resolution and images in dark surroundings are often snowy . 	0
MT	264	Many people see proven relief of their symptoms and complaints by complementary medicine . 	0
MT	265	However there is no substantiated data that this healing isn ' t simply due to the placebo effect . 	0
MT	266	Besides many practices in this field are not regulated professions , which means that quacks and phonies can practice these occupations unknown to the patients . 	0
MT	267	That ' s why the statutory health insurance companies should not cover such treatments . 	1
MT	268	It would be conceivable to invest more into the training and control of this occupation sector on the part of the state . 	0
MT	269	For these reasons supermarkets and shopping centres should not be allowed to be open for business on arbitrary Sundays and holidays . 	1
MT	270	On top of that , private and family life suffers massively because of this reduction and shifting in designated off-times . 	0
MT	271	And it ’ s only the large companies that can afford the additional personnel expenditure . 	0
MT	272	Due to the increase in opening hours on Sundays and holidays there is a rise in employment . 	0
MT	273	However it ' s mainly temps ( that is , students , pupils etc . ) who are employed , so this has hardly any effect on the level of full-time employment and the number of unemployed . 	0
MT	274	Even if one might think that additional rent control is needed besides the current tenant protection , one should not deny longstanding owners the opportunity to adjust their returns to market level . 	0
MT	275	A cap on rent increases upon tenant change is therefore not to be supported . 	1
MT	276	Rent prices are already regulated in favour of tenants due to existing laws and the rent index . 	0
MT	277	In view of the high prices for buying flats with existing rent contracts , these are an unattractive investment . 	0
MT	278	Rent prices should be limited by a cap when there ' s a change of tenant . 	1
MT	279	Landlords may want to earn as much as possible , and many , consistent with market principles , are prepared to pay higher rents , but that people with the same income suddenly must pay more and can ' t live in the same flat anymore seems implausible . 	0
MT	280	Gentrification destroys entire districts and their culture . 	0
MT	281	Also the rules of the public transportation services are rarely observed . 	0
MT	282	Every day passengers are harassed by hooligans and drunks on the underground , trains and busses . 	0
MT	283	Passengers would definitely feel safer then . 	0
MT	284	This is why we need more police presence in public transport , even if there are actually designated in-house security forces . 	1
MT	285	Fear of punishment hence does not deter murderers . 	0
MT	286	Despite the death penalty there are significantly more homicides in the US than in Germany . 	0
MT	287	The state ought to prevent murder - not avenge it . 	1
MT	288	' An eye for an eye ' seems to miss the point . 	0
MT	289	A re-introduction of capital punishment in Germany would be a step back into the Middle Ages . 	0
MT	290	Thus Sundays should remain a day for getting together with family , otherwise there will be a new kind of leisure activity where people spend their time in supermarkets instead of outside or in conversation etc . Furthermore , there ' s no need to keep shops open on Sundays . 	0
MT	291	For you can go shopping 6 days a week , as shops are open till 10pm on some days . 	0
MT	292	It is quite clear that Sunday should remain a day of rest . 	1
MT	293	Besides you ' re not allowed to leave other rubbish without punishment . 	0
MT	294	One reason for this is that they have thus far hardly had to fear the consequences despite the obligation to clean up . 	0
MT	295	Dog owners should pay higher fines for dog dirt left on pavements , although there aren ' t enough bins and bag-dispensers for dog dirt . 	1
MT	296	The city , especially the green spaces , should be kept tidy after all , for they are there for our recreation . 	0
MT	297	A higher fine , so dog owners would have to dig deeper into their pockets , is supposed to be a deterrent after all . 	0
MT	298	One could worry that our farmers would then run into economic difficulties . 	0
MT	299	We should thus all limit our consumption of meat rigorously . 	1
MT	300	Furthermore , the production of meat is comparably resource-intensive . 	0
MT	301	Excessive consumption of meat is unhealthy . 	0
MT	302	However , no serious economist has confirmed this prediction to date . 	0
MT	303	However , a death would not be of any more use to those affected and their relatives than if the felon receives a long sentence . 	0
MT	304	If Germany were to introduce the death penalty , convicted felons could not be paroled or break out of prison and commit new felonies . 	0
MT	305	Handing out capital punishment is unethical . 	0
MT	306	Plus we don ' t live in medieval times anymore . 	0
MT	307	We don ' t need it . 	1
MT	308	Many European countries , for instance the Netherlands , Sweden and Great Britain , have already understood this and successfully adjusted the opening hours for retailers . 	0
MT	309	Considering the growing digitization of society , the traditional model of the weekend will soon be obsolete . 	0
MT	310	However , especially for working customers this would mean greater flexibility and fewer nerve-racking peak times during the week . 	0
MT	311	This may be a change for the employees that cannot to be implemented easily . 	0
MT	312	Supermarkets and shopping centres should be allowed to open on any Sundays and holidays . 	1
MT	313	But even without an ex-girlfriend he would never touch that . 	0
MT	314	Ralf does insist that they drank advocaat together . 	0
MT	315	Thus one of his ex-girlfriends must have been there . 	1
MT	316	When he got back from Ralf ' s party last night he was still stone-cold sober . 	0
MT	317	Whenever Peter bumps into an ex-girlfriend at a party , he forgoes any further consumption of alcohol just in case . 	0
MT	318	Capital punishment would be murder and would have to be punished with the death penalty itself . 	0
MT	319	What , then , ought to be done with criminals who have committed truly awful crimes such as murder or rape - should they simply be allowed to live on although they have taken or destroyed another life ? 	0
MT	320	Germany should by no means introduce capital punishment . 	1
MT	321	If there were capital punishment , this would mean people are allowed to put themselves above others and rule over their lives . 	0
MT	322	Yes , for it is a much graver punishment to be imprisoned forever and be tortured by one ' s own thoughts than to be killed quickly and easily by an injection . 	0
MT	323	Besides , a higher degree of luxury ( expensive flats ) is not necessary for the majority of the people , but rather a flat at all . 	0
MT	324	A stop must be put to exorbitant rents by imposing a limit on rent increases when changing residences . 	1
MT	325	No , the retirement age should be raised to 65 again . 	1
MT	326	People are getting older on average , but they are not sicker and not duller because of it . 	0
MT	327	Without them we ' d forgo a great deal of collected experience . 	0
MT	328	And we ' d have to offer more leisure activities for seniors . 	0
MT	329	Just as with other choices in culture or infrastructure , public broadcasters are also to be financed , regardless of whether individuals make use of their programming or not . 	0
MT	330	However , it is impossible to monitor this and collect more customized fees . 	0
MT	331	I do doubt that there is anyone who has never at least indirectly watched the programming of the public broadcasters . 	0
MT	332	Critics point out that they are not using what ' s on offer by public broadcasting . 	0
MT	333	The TV / radio licence fee can only be required of all citizens / households equally . 	1
MT	334	I think Fritz has never been in a fight in his life . 	1
MT	335	As a boy he did use to scuffle with the other choirboys , but that hardly counts as a proper brawl . 	0
MT	336	And he always chickens out when things get dicey . 	0
MT	337	Yesterday , when the bouncer wouldn ' t let us in , he was suddenly gone . 	0
MT	338	Yet the fees are demanded from everybody who does not apply for a waiver , no matter how many receiver devices actually exist in the household and how they are being used . 	0
MT	339	However it is obvious that the license fee officers are not in a position to check the usage of every single device . 	0
MT	340	The TV license fee should only be collected from those who actually make use of the programming of the public broadcasters . 	1
MT	341	After all there are many people in Germany who pay the fee although they merely use a computer to work . 	0
MT	342	No one should have the possibility to pick up the morning-after pill over the counter at the pharmacy . 	1
MT	343	Though there ' d be the advantage of forgoing the embarrassment of a visit to the doctor or a nighttime trip to the walk-in clinic , women should still be informed about the risks and have a gynaecological examination before taking it . 	0
MT	344	Furthermore there ' s the risk that women could use the over-the-counter morning-after pill as a substitute for contraception . 	0
MT	345	The patient could learn to be more aware of his or her body and to treat it more healthily . 	0
MT	346	This will do little damage to the pharmaceutical industry , and conventional medicine will also hardly suffer . 	0
MT	347	A reduction in the amount of chemically produced medication per person is most certainly desirable . 	1
MT	348	From time immemorial humans have had complementary medicine , and it has not generally been ineffective . 	0
MT	349	Of course it would be nice and simple if after a fun night out with a party acquaintance you could simply take the ' morning-after pill ' and feel at ease . 	0
MT	350	But it ' s not that simple . 	0
MT	351	Perhaps a new life was already created that night . 	0
MT	352	I would kill it without further thought . 	0
MT	353	That ' s why a visit to the doctor and professional advice should remain mandatory . 	1
MT	354	With a BA dissertation one can , however , demonstrate interests and subject matter expertise particularly well . 	0
MT	355	After all one doesn ' t excel in every subject . 	0
MT	356	The BA dissertation should , if not make up the entire grade , then at least constitute a larger share of it . 	1
MT	357	For a good overall grade opens many doors , but is not of top priority for employers . 	0
MT	358	Capital punishment is not a solution , as it cannot be ruled out that the judicial process may make mistakes . 	0
MT	359	Criminals should not be put in luxury prisons , though . 	0
MT	360	After all there are criminals who enjoy ' living ' in prison for its decent board , no taxes to be paid , no stress with work . 	0
MT	361	Still , the state needs the death penalty as a deterrent to horrific crimes . 	1
MT	362	Dog owners may think that dog dirt is only a harmless secretion of an animal like any other . 	0
MT	363	That ' s why causing such obstacles must to be more urgently punished . 	1
MT	364	This results in a lack of alertness in the road traffic comparable to a minor offense of the traffic regulations . 	0
MT	365	Dog dirt on the pavement requires my complete , ground-focused attention on my way to work . 	0
MT	366	Yet then they misjudge its impact on road traffic . 	0
OC	367	I thought maybe we ' d grab dinner and try to find something fun to do ( which may be hard in Cleveland on a Sunday night , but . . . we can try ! ) . 	0

OC	441	Gay , bi , or whatever , I think that ' s the lesson I learned , and the film is about what happens if you * don ' t * learn and apply that lesson . 	0
OC	442	The publicity for the film gets the film wrong , but I think the film gets this point sort of " right . " 	0
OC	443	I hear you more clearly . 	0
OC	444	I suppose I could agree with you and still go in a slightly different direction : I think stunted passion can drive people to lead lives in which they appear to be passionless . 	1
OC	445	It ' s not an easy mindset to recall after nearly a decade being out of the closet , but I would say that I spent a good deal of my 20s , when I felt both uncomfortable with my own sexuality and isolated about being who I was , using my drive and my power as an intellectual , emotional , and spiritual being to either route my passion anywhere BUT sex , or to holding myself in . 	0
OC	446	In a sense , what the movie gets " right " for me happens most clearly with Ennis ' s character : the force of nature of his passion is one he devotes to containing himself , rather than trying to break free . 	0
OC	447	And he does fail to contain himself in many ways . . . but what ' s tragic is that had he failed a little more , he might have been able to succeed at something a lot more fulfilling . 	0
OC	448	Does that make any sense ? 	0
OC	449	Maybe one way I could come at it is nothing more than this : I had a couple of clunky , difficult relationships with women before I came out as a queer man , and I ' ve had a couple of decent relationships with women since coming out , fucking around with a lot of men , and giving my whole heart and soul to a couple of men over the years . 	0
OC	450	Which is to say : although my desires for women are a fairly small part of my overall makeup , I could only express them decently once I took the brakes off my WHOLE self . 	0

OC	1772	I think things will pick up . 	1
OC	1773	People also don ' t like to look at relisted auctions , and I relsited two . 	0
OC	1774	It might be because I listed sweaters and girdles instead of dresses and coats , it might be because of competition from other sellers ( let ' s face it Ebay is so overstocked , it can be hard to get your auctions looked at ) . 	1
OC	1775	I began to change stuff ( gallery pic format , layout / background , user ID ) because of the slowness / lower number of hits on my auctions . 	0

OC	1815	It ' s OK that you disagree , but your disagreement doesn ' t make conflicting points of view any less valid than your own . . . and the impression you give is that you take offense because people disagree with you . 	0
OC	1816	People pushing back is not making you a pariah . . . it ' s saying that many of us see value that you don ' t wish to see , and that many of us see love as a LOT more than just valuing someone else ' s well-being more than your own . . . or having a rough fuck . 	0

OC	1837	The existing intelligence fusion centers are [ theoretically / technically / kinda ] state institutions rather than a centralized federal one , but they ' re funded by federal grants , accountable to federal oversight , and several of them ( if not all - we ' re not sure yet ) are required to share the intelligence they gather with federal agencies . 	0

OC	1945	Obviously everyone except for Wilf is protected by not having fully human DNA and thus being immune to the overwrite . 	0
OC	1946	So are we supposed to assume that the only non-Master people left on the planet are Wilf , the Doctor , Donna , and maybe the green people ? 	0
OC	1947	The Naismith family also needs some background info , as well as the green people . 	0
OC	1948	Still , how does a former prime minister gather a crazed group of disciples ? 	0

OC	1966	She and I have a lot in common and I always eagerly await her comments , replies , etc and find myself wanting to do things for her and talk to her , but I already have someone in my life and it is frankly really confusing . 	0
OC	1967	Part of me is telling myself to be careful because I already have someone , but another part of me really wishes that I could go for her . 	0
OC	1968	I honestly have little attraction to men as a rule in the physical sense , so personality , talents , mannerisms , and interests become more of the basis for my feelings for someone . 	0

OC	2013	I use Photobucket because it ' s easy and the service it provides is enough for what I do ( read : not a lot ) . 	0
OC	2014	But I wouldn ' t recommend it if you intend on linking a lot of people to it because it has a tendency to go " OMG TOO MANY PAGE VIEWS EXCEEDED BANDWIDTH WE ARE GONNA MAKE DIS IMAGE UNAVAILABABLE UNTIL NEXT MONTH ! " 	0
OC	2015	I -could - be wrong about it , but I ' m pretty sure I ' m not . 	0
OC	2016	I was going to suggest Facebook , but FB has a 60 image limit per album and uploads can be a bit of a bitch . 	1

OC	2042	i seem to have successfully extracted myself from academia , for the time being - - somehow managed to graduate last sunday - - and have landed in the most mahvelous summer job at the tar pits as the assistant excavator and it ' s like summer camp , only better , because i get PAID to learn anatomy and hang out with the loveliest people and i HURT everywhere my last day at the vile lawfirm was tuesday first day at the museum on wednesday and five days straight excavating since then and i hurt EVerywhere my back , my right arm , my left palm , my abdominal muscles , my feet - - which is bizarre because i spend most of my day lying on my stomach , leaning over a 3 x 3 foot grid of asphalt picking at dead animals and i am just so thrilled to be in so much pain it ' s great and i don ' t have a paper to write ! 	1
OC	2043	my god ! 	0

OC	2050	You might be right , and if you are , then there ' s no case where Safari would be better for media , other than possibly a projector . 	0

OC	2052	ps I really want to meet your hub and furry babes ! 	0
OC	2053	Oh , me too . 	0

OC	2055	Your doggie < 33 ! 	0

OC	2068	do you have plans RIGHT after work tomorrow ? 	0
OC	2069	It ' s hard to resist arguing with them , but they ' re all so fucking stupid that it doesn ' t even get you anywhere . 	0
OC	2070	I know , it ' s irritating . 	0
OC	2071	I have issues with " film critics " who insert their own visions of what they believe is " proper sociology " --whether it ' s a homophobic straight man sniffing at the concept of two men , or homo-superior asswipes who believe that how THEY met and how THEY live THEIR lives should be the universally-accepted way of depicting man-to-man relationships without accepting differences or nuances . 	0
OC	2072	Some people have issues with the story . . . others don ' t want to deal with the hype about it . . . . others see something to it . . . and all points of view are fine . 	0
OC	2073	As difficult as it may be to crack the shells some of us use to protect ourselves from life ' s difficulties and frustrations , you learn nothing about yourself if you choose to learn nothing from the experiences of others , fictional or not . 	0
OC	2074	I ' ve had my own experience in losing people and property by murder , death , robbery , and accident to know that it ' s awful to live through and easier to deal with with the compassion of others . 	0
OC	2075	I don ' t have to live through a hurricane myself in order to do SOMETHING to help people affected by one . . . 	0
OC	2076	Putting it another way , my mother never had to understand my " thing " for facial hair and particular traits in men in order for her empathize with my need for male companionship . . . she knows the need for male companionship satisfied by my dad . . . 	0
OC	2077	If you can ' t put yourself in a position to either sympathize or empathize with at least one of the things you credit to my " logic " , then the storyline will hold nothing for you . . . and that would be unfortunate . 	0
OC	2078	No , you don ' t need to be bi male shepherds on a mountain in Wyoming to " legitimately " comment on it . . . for you to UNDERSTAND the story , you need to be able to sympathize or empathize with the characters and their situation . 	1
OC	2079	And that is bullshit posturing not worth the electrons that carry their spew of " holding court " . 	0
OC	2080	I think most movie critics are full of pompous self-centered hot air to begin with , and these guys worry too much about the genre and storyline than they do about the technical expertise of the screenplay or the quality of the cinematography or direction or production , or the artistic value of the sound track or skills of the actors . 	0
OC	2081	Aha ! 	0
OC	2082	Yes , it was completely anonymous . 	0

OC	2100	I just got a call from my mother two minutes ago : " I ' m on my way home from work and I ' m about to pass by IHOP . 	0
OC	2101	Sometimes the " I am putting all the food I own into this one meal before it goes bad while I am at home for a week " meal ends up being pretty damn good , but it was not the International Passport with Swedish pancakes and lingonberries . 	0
OC	2102	So I made myself a spinach salad with sliced pears , crumbled bacon , shredded Jarlsberg cheese , and raspberry vinaigrette . 	0
OC	2103	I had every intention of going to the Harvard Square IHOP on Saturday afternoon before flying back home , but I realized that I had a ton of food in my fridge that needed to be cooked and eaten ( including a pound of salmon that had gone bad anyway - FAIL ) . 	0
OC	2104	Does that not mean anything to you ? 	0
OC	2105	I will never understand why there are people in the world who don ' t - it ' s the INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF FUCKING PANCAKES , everyone . 	1

OC	2113	For usability it ' s probably worse , though . 	0
OC	2114	And honestly , if I wanted to have a screenshot of a site to make it look nice , I ' d probably at least consider using Safari ; the stuff is more typographically " correct " using that rendering , which in the context of an image of a site may well look better . 	0
OC	2115	A lot of people seem to prefer it , though . 	0
OC	2116	Will go fix , thanks ! 	0
OC	2117	Heh , this is what happens when I model for stuff - apparently my hands ( esp . thumb ) do not behave like normal people ' s . 	0

OC	2124	Cincinnati had a wicked wind storm last night , the result of the lovely Ike visiting the Midwest . 	0

OC	2203	Too forward , I don ' t know , but you ' re very forward and it can be annoying ( recent case in point ) . 	0
OC	2204	Confrontational implies attitude and having a bone to pick , when sometimes just saying the truth is effective enough . 	0
OC	2205	Blunt is good , but controntational is bad . 	1
OC	2206	Its easy to flatter people , but its difficult to tell the truth and say something honest that might sound mean . 	0

OC	2282	The most frustrating thing about that game , to me , is that the random encounters are literally random . 	1
OC	2283	In more modern RPGs the " random " encounters are calculated in a such a way that they ' re spaced out a bit , though not by a specific amount . 	0
OC	2284	It keeps the appearance of enemies steady , but unpredictable and less tedious . 	0

OC	2291	The passage of these measures reflects a conservative majority , however slim that is . 	0
OC	2292	So , it actually shows that , at least in this election , running on a socially conservative platform was not enough to win the votes . 	1

OC	2490	i can ' t help it - i am extremely judgmental of people who don ' t love their pets and take care of them like they should . 	0
OC	2491	I just don ' t get how people can take advantage of that type of trust and devotion : ( Dirty Santa is so much fun ! 	0
OC	2492	My dog was a rescue and he was extremely abused by his previous owner , yet he is so trusting and loving of everyone . 	0
OC	2493	Everyone takes turns opening a gift , and if someone gets something you want , you can steal it from them . 	0
OC	2494	Everyone buys a unisex gift and wraps it with no name tag . 	0
OC	2495	It ' s the most fun if you have at least 10 people because people constantly steal from each other and in my family it can get ruthless XD 	0
OC	2496	It ' s better / easier for me if I use packaged egg whites , because then I have a hope of using the " leftovers " before they go bad . 	1
OC	2497	As to why I don ' t have shell eggs , it ' s twofold : I do better when I avoid egg yolks , and my use of eggs in general is mostly for baking . 	0
OC	2498	So as long as I keep that in mind and reduce the oil by at least 1 / 3 , it should be okay . 	0
OC	2499	Really , the only thing likely to give me fits is the egg / oil mix , because I ' ve found that my egg white breads don ' t " hold " the oil the same way when made with whole eggs . 	1
OC	2500	I don ' t have any milk-milk , so I ' ll need to reconstitute some from powder , then measure it , because I ' m not sure exactly how much powder and water are needed for three tablespoons ( 2tsp of powder and 8tsp of water ? ) and with quantities in this range , there ' s less tolerance for error , but that ' s not bad . 	1

OC	2509	I understand your frustration and disappointment , but don ' t treat something valuable as nothing because it ' s not everything all at once . 	0
OC	2510	I was envious of them , but I would never be that stupid go between the traffic . 	0
OC	2511	That ' ll learn you ! 	0
OC	2512	The only reason our schools are " competitive " is because the administration choose to do things like this : force us to choose between our own school and everyone else . 	0
OC	2513	and , of course , we are obligated to choose our own school . 	0
OC	2514	I may crash some Paxon after " party , " because I miss you guys , but Stanton prom is free , and your prom is expensive . 	1

OC	2517	I remember it was MIDNIGHT I actually went to sleep whereas when you came I was at the computer . 	0
OC	2518	It seems to me that the overwhelming mass of their garments is only accentuated with the ridiculous level of adornment ; it ’ s as if someone reached back into the early 90 ’ s , got their hands on a Bedazzler and went plastic rhinestone crazy . 	0

OC	2521	gosh , that murakami exhibit at the brooklyn museum was awesome , wasn ' t it ? 	0
OC	2522	But if we do , there ' s an obligation to be careful where we point the thing . 	1
OC	2523	It ' s generally a bad idea to make one ' s " feminist " argument at the expense of actual women ' s experiences . 	0
OC	2524	if something causes wisps of steam to begin issuing from my ears , I will almost certainly learn something significant from it . 	0
OC	2525	There are folks whose writing I read primarily for that purpose - though a fair chunk of the time , it ' s my own argument that gets vivisected . 	0
OC	2526	That kind of situation is what the phrase " stop being on my side , you ' re making my side look stupid " was invented for . 	0
OC	2527	I like this one too . 	0

OC	2533	Anyone interested ? 	0
OC	2534	eh , ya aint too bad 	0
OC	2535	Ok have a good evening : ) may be see you later : ) 	0
OC	2536	It ' s not just an academic exercise in utopian philosophy ; real people , with diverse individual needs , will be living the changes we make . 	0
OC	2537	Making feminist arguments at the expense of actual women ' s experiences is , IMO , one of the most significant fracture points within feminism , The reverse is also true : the political is personal . 	0
OC	2538	Mind you , Canada isn ' t perfect , by any means ; another part of why it was possible for me is because my family was supportive - I ' d have been in a much more precarious position if they weren ' t . 	0
OC	2539	Kid won , of course . ) 	0
OC	2540	( My son ' s father didn ' t even get an opt-in ; he was . . . not very stable - but again , Canadian conditions meant I only had to consider that problem in terms of the personal , weighing fairness to him against what it could mean for my baby if he took it into his head to try for custody . 	0
OC	2541	I ' m pretty sure we ' re at least close to the same page - it ' s partly because Canada has some of those social and legal conditions that I was able to let my daughter ' s father opt out . 	1
OC	2542	( IOW , I think he might be a Nice Guy ( tm ) . ) 	0
OC	2543	What I suspect here is that he has a vested interest in not changing the institutional injustices , because in a just world , women wouldn ' t need men . 	0
OC	2544	I suspect the latter , because of him bringing up " pregnancy is so dangerous " as an argument supporting mandatory support - the only connection I can see between them is that the financial support would mean better health care ( assuming the father , or his parents , have or are able to earn enough to make a difference ) and an improved , but not risk-free , outcome ; otherwise , obligating the father ' s involvement has no effect on those dangers ( or may have a negative effect ) . 	0
OC	2545	I ' m not so sure the KiSA is on your side ; he didn ' t seem to have the slightest interest in the injustices I was trying to talk about - at best , he ' s convinced they ' re immutable ; at worst , he ' s got a hidden agenda . 	1

OC	3201	They manage to scrape together the money for their own ranch , and indeed have a period of some happiness together , during which they wind up shooting to death a couple shitheads who come to their spread with the intent of killing our protagonists - in circumstances that make it clear it was self defense . 	0

OC	3209	I ' m no stranger to holding a minority opinion in a variety of fields , but it ' s been rare that I ' ve gotten this much personal hostility over openly stating I dislike a particular story , and that I can ' t for the life of me understand why people are cumming all over themselves about it . 	0

OC	3232	The McLellan family had written to Canadian senators to say they cancelled a vacation in Canada because of the hunt , which they called " horrible " and " inhumane , " Montreal ' s La Presse reports . 	0
OC	3233	While I don ' t at all agree with the seal hunt , I give huge props to this : Senator fires back at U .

OC	3234	She said Americans are not in a position to criticize others . 	0
OC	3235	In her response , Senator Céline Hervieux-Payette said that what she finds horrible is " the daily massacre of innocent people in Iraq , the execution of prisoners – mainly blacks – in American prisons , the massive sale of handguns to Americans , the destabilization of the entire world by the American government ' s aggressive foreign policy , etc .

OC	3662	After my post a bit earlier in Windows Safari , kurisu posted this fascinating article on the differences between Windows and OS X ( and now Safari for Windows ) font rendering , which has puzzled me for ages . 	0
OC	3663	I think it ' s fair to say that neither is " better " , but it ' s interesting to see the way the different approaches go . 	1

OC	3674	The only good thing about this whole nightmare is seeing how loving and selfless people are being towards the victims of this fire . 	0
OC	3675	And that doesn ' t even touch the vast differences between the lives we are able to live NOW versus the experiences of non-urban gay and bi men prior to the 1970 ' s . 	0
OC	3676	It ' s one thing to not understand what you ' ve never experienced , it ' s another thing entirely to disdain what you don ' t understand without making an attempt to walk a mile in the boots you turn your nose up over . 	0
OC	3677	You have to apply your OWN experiences and ability to read non-verbal communication and pluck yourself out of L . A . or Cambridge and the life you live NOW in order to feel the impact of the setting and circumstances of the story . . . and if you ' ve never been in love , never lived with vast distance between you and someone you love , never lived in small-town rural America , never lived with having nearly everyone in a 20-mile radius KNOWING you and your family , never lived with all those people who are the extent of your known world putting very exacting expectations on how you will live and die . . . then you will have trouble connecting with the film and the story . 	0
OC	3678	The story of " Brokeback Mountain " is sparse . . . that is part of its power , because it requires the reader or viewer to put his / her OWN experiences into play and feel the emotion generated from within yourself --not something that grabs you by the shoulders and says " Oh , Bob--I LOVE YOU ! " and turns into a chick-flick full of flowery prose and verbal vomit that leads you to big block letters saying " THIS IS A LOVE STORY . . . YOU CAN TELL FROM THE LINES . " 	1
OC	3679	And while Mars-Jones may have worked with Edmund White and spent some time in Charlottesville , Virginia , I have serious doubts if the Brit truly grasps the lives of rural Americans who are NOT in the " ivory tower " . 	1
OC	3680	I agree with you whole-heartedly about Ehrenstein--he probably has never stepped outside of his little world to see , much less understand , how rural gay AND bisexual men live outside his little bubble of long-term happy partnership in a place where the dirtiest thing one encounters is the street person he passes on the sidewalk and inhabits the happy land of make-believe of movies and live-as-queerly-as-you-want-without-fear . 	0
OC	3681	They are happy to be urban--and urbane- - " queers " of 2005 , and they never presume to " lower themselves " to understand lives that are different from their own . . . very much like the Log Cabin Republicans who are more concerned about taking care of their POSESSIONS than they are about the big-picture of what their political support does to us as a minority population . . . as " W " has no clue or compassion regarding the outcomes of his policies , since he has never lived with privation , never had to worry about how he would pay the bills if his job went away because someone always swooped in to fix things for him if things fell apart in his private life . 	1
OC	3682	That is the big problem with blowhards like them- - they have never experienced the isolation and loneliness and societal pressure put on less-than-college-degreed rural American gay and bisexual men . . . therefore the story and the premise means NOTHING to them . 	0
OC	3683	I ' m pretty numb right now and trying to stay that way so I don ' t have a meltdown . 	0
OC	3684	But it always leads to lives and potential unfulfilled when love is thwarted . . . and depression , too . 	1
OC	3685	It ' s a love story alright . . . but it ' s a tragedy , too . . . passion between two people does not always lead to a happy conclusion when conditioning from childhood and reinforcement by a society that can ' t be separated from your own life makes your allegiance to compliance more important than what you love . 	0

OC	4027	Since ol ' Lance has already transformed himself into Brave Sir Robin and flounced ( ' bout a six , I figure ; the execution was technically quite good , if unoriginal , until he spoiled it by coming back for one parting shot ) , there ' s little point in piling on him there ; I doubt it ' ll penetrate his + 4 Armor of Complacence ( what , surely you don ' t think he won ' t sneak back to see how we took it ? ) , and it ' ll just distract further from what could be a very productive discussion ( which you could join if you ' re so inclined ) . 	0
OC	4028	Anyway , it wouldn ' t be courteous to Derek . 	0

OC	4503	We talked about performing that for the next recital later this year , but I decided not to because it would be too similar . 	0
OC	4504	However , I did decide I should sing one of Tom Lehrer ' s pieces , I just have to decide which one . 	0

OC	4660	The use of sterotype " Southern " accents , as I ' ve mentioned too common in films set in New Orleans was unfortunately not avoided , and at first was quite distracting . 	0

OC	4749	The different ways Christians handle Grace led to their splitting into hundreds of denominations . 	0
OC	4750	Christ ' s admonitions on divorce were really a way to prevent women from being abandoned by their husbands , and leaving families without livelihoods . 	0
OC	4751	If you continue to live in sin though , you haven ' t repented so you can ' t gain grace . 	0
OC	4752	Well you can repent of a sin , and then live in grace . 	1
OC	4753	And it gets more complicated of course , because some Protestants believe that salvation is through faith alone , some through faith and acts , and some still even believe in Pre-Destination , which means either you ' re on the list or your not and nothing you do in this life has a bearing on that . 	1
OC	4754	Protestants don ' t have that option , because they don ' t believe their preachers stand in for God , and so they don ' t have the power to absolve . 	0
OC	4755	If you were Catholic and gay , you could technically cohabitate and be celibate and live in grace , but if you slip up and have sex , you could go to confession and be absolved . 	0

OC	5313	Looks aren ' t everything . 	1
OC	5314	In fact , they usually lead to an artificially inflated sense of worth for the attractive person , and attitudes which usually piss me off to no end . 	0
OC	5315	Plus they ' ll likely be bad at sex , having never had to put much effort into it and not the intelligence to realize how much fun it can actually be . 	0

OC	5381	This particular argument has more to do with social standards . 	0
OC	5382	It is accepted that all people are " sinners " but Christians are supposed to repent their sins . 	0
OC	5383	I ' m not a Christian so I ' m not sure how " Grace " figures into this discussion . 	0
OC	5384	My understanding is that " grace " has to do with salvation . 	0
OC	5385	My argument is just that it is hypocritical to punish homosexuals for being unrepentant sinners but allow divorced people off the hook . 	0
OC	5386	Christ didn ' t say anything about homosexuals but he was quite explicit about divorce . 	0
OC	5387	The issue seems to be that giving social status in the Church to unrepentant sinners would encourage sin by setting a bad example . 	0

OC	5600	Sometimes the arguments are so devoid of intelligence , or I ' ve heard them so many times before , that there ' s no reward in refuting them , but if the other side is willing to engage , then having to explain myself and not getting any free passes means that the argument gets a good workout . 	0
OC	5601	Is this HHGGTG ? 	0
OC	5602	But right now we don ' t have that . 	0
OC	5603	Instead , we have conservative think tanks complaining that what little aid we do give costs too much . 	0
OC	5604	What " choice for men " comes down to for me is who bears the cost instead . 	1
OC	5605	I ' m a lot more comfortable with the idea of a father being able to legally opt out if there ' s a sufficient support system in place so that the child ' s mother can raise the child without assistance from the father - even if she chooses not to . 	0
OC	5606	But it ' s not particularly relevant here unless one takes the attitude that child support is supposed to be either compensation for , or an equivalent " punishment " to , pregnancy , and I don ' t see how one can reconcile that attitude with feminism . 	0
OC	5607	And as for calling folks on things , it depends on the situation . 	0
OC	5608	I think the bringing up of " pregnancy is so dangerous " may simply have been a context failure . 	1
OC	5609	I typically see that argument used in the context of pro-choice or childfree advocacy , and he may have just internalized that as " the feminist position . " 	0
OC	5610	So marked . 	0

OC	6489	But up until recently , anyway , going on welfare as a single mother was not terribly stigmatized . 	0
OC	6490	The German social safety net has been progressively undermined over the past few years , so I have to think that this option is getting harder - they have a lot more emphasis on working to earn one ' s benefits , which is obviously a problem if you have little ones . 	0

OC	6757	I grant you there ' s a certain amount of urban sniffery in those two perspectives on thot of truth in th my pserspective there ' s also a lot of truth in what they say that most people jibbering madly about the movie just don ' t want to deal with . 	0

OC	6846	But you should be able to follow this link and get a page with a link to YepRoc ' s Goodnight Oslo page , which has an audio stream of the record . 	0
OC	6847	Hm , well YepRoc ' s site is not online right now . 	0
OC	6848	maybe it ' s not that they didn ' t want to fuck you before , but just feel safer telling you once you ' re in a relationship and they can ' t really act on it ? 	1
OC	6849	it may just be fear . 	0

OC	6852	        For the record : I haven ' t seen it , so I really have no opinion as of yet ; however I ' m probably gonna wait on this one - - I ' m just not a fan of Westerns .   Even though its really a movie about sheepherders .   Technically . 	0
OC	6853	It is streamable from YepRoc - - matter of fact I should update the post with a link to that . 	0
OC	6854	Wow , you didn ' t know ? 	0

OC	6864	I ' ll have to ask Fay how she cooked their rooster - he turned out very tasty . 	1
OC	6865	What I take offense at is the suggestion there ' s something wrong with me for disliking the story ( and presumably by extension , the movie . ) 	0
OC	6866	Note that I ' m talking about the response to my opinion of this particular work in the aggregate , not necessarily or specifically yours . 	0
OC	6867	Whether or not the word " love " gets used or not , clearly there ' s supposedly passion in the story . . . but what does it do ? 	0
OC	6868	I take offense at the insinuation that I ' m some kind of traitor to the " Gay Cause " for thinking the story sucks and that the hype around the movie is simply INTOLERABLE . 	1

OC	6885	What ' s really pissing me off is watching a liberal reporter tour damaged areas of Lebanon with a representative of Hezbollah while he whines about what the Israelis are doing to their cities . 	1
OC	6886	WTF ? 	0

OC	6923	I ' ve just been tussling with that particularly poisonous variety of " feminist ally " , a Knight in Shining Armor . 	0
OC	6924	I ' d like to say I took him apart , but , while I believe I acquitted myself very well , I fear he missed the point altogether , and flounced with his complacence and his virtuously noble self-image unscathed . 	0
OC	6925	When I deal with them , I sound for all the world like a stereotypical grim-and-strident radical feminist - out come phrases like " sexist entitlement " and " male privilege " . 	0
OC	6926	Nope , I ' m definitely not a Fun Feminist when it comes to that . 	0
OC	6927	A Knight in Shining Armor is the sort of male self-described feminist ( or he may describe himself as a feminist ally , or some other term chosen to show that of course he ' d never usurp our movement - this one favors " radical pro-feminist " ) who is involved with feminism because he ' s Good and Noble , and will slay all the evil misogynistic patriarchal villains and make the world safe for womankind . 	0

OC	7064	I don ' t think this movie was shelved so much because of it ' s being offensive as much as it just being embarassingly badly done . 	1
OC	7065	I know that many animators have been pushing for some kind of official rerelease just because the segments with Brer Rabbit are just damn good animation , but otherwise it wasn ' t hugely financially or critically successful and really didn ' t quite fit next to other live action / animation hybrid family films like Mary Poppins or Bedknobs and Broomsticks on the Disney Classics shelves . 	0
OC	7066	The most labor any black person does is cooking , there ' s no bloody uprising , nobody is beaten , bought or sold . 	0
OC	7067	Remus does get a browbeating from the mother and grandmother for telling stories to the kid , and he does get very " no mam , yessum " humble and even depressed about it , but that ' s as bad as things get . 	0
OC	7068	Not bad as in imoral , but bad as in just poor quality . 	0
OC	7069	It ' s not ever overtly offensive or in any way compelling durring the live segments , but Remus does look tweeked out of his gord durring Zippadee Doo Dah and whenever the little boy cries his transforms into the vissage of a demon . 	0
OC	7070	thank you ! 	0
OC	7071	For two reasons : the animation is some of the best done character animation that exists and because the live action elements are VERY badly written , acted and directed . 	0
OC	7072	So yeah , my basic thoughts ? 	0
OC	7073	It ' s not a great film , the worries about racism are far overblown , the kid ' s a demon , the animation is beautiful . 	0

OC	7159	Also , I ' ve heard arguments on both sides of the seal hunt , without really having any hard data that ' s impartial . 	0
OC	7160	The truth is that I disagree with the seal hunt in principle , in the same way that I disagree with game hunting . 	1
OC	7161	No , no rebuttal here . 	0

OC	7186	also things should definitely be darker and there shouldn ' t be so much detail in the street , if it ' s dark out then you shouldn ' t be able to see all of the stuff you are drawing . 	1
OC	7187	I think the first panel could be done more simplistically and effectively . 	0
OC	7188	I think you need to just loosen up and go with more instinct , it really feels like you are second guessing yourself a lot in these panels . 	1

OC	7202	Yeah , I don ' t know . 	0
OC	7203	The best I can come up with is that the Time Lords are trying to unlock the Time War and are manipulating the Master and the green people to repair Gallifrey . 	0

OC	7252	" I ' m much clearer on what ' s problematic about # 5 : it subtly assumes that a woman , at any rate a pregnant woman , needs a man , and glosses over the injustices that create that need . 	0
OC	7253	Sir Knigget is not without utility ; he not only contributed greatly to clarifying my thinking regarding that discussion , he also shed some light on the complex tangle of my feminism . 	1
OC	7254	- Sunflower If I ' m reading my feminist history aright , that ' s right on the historic fracture point between liberal feminism and radical feminism ; liberal feminism preferred to address injustices by adjusting the existing paradigms , while radical feminism believed it was necessary to examine , and work to change , the paradigm itself . 	1
OC	7255	Obliging men to ante up does nothing whatsoever to address those injustices ; it seeks only to alleviate them . " 	0
OC	7256	Old-school radical feminism , or so I understand , largely examined paradigms through collectivist-socialist , or even outright Marxist , lenses , while I ' m cut [ changes metaphors in midstream ] from rather different cloth ( though the fabric still has a left bias - " individualist-socialist " might describe it ) . 	0
OC	7257	( I invite corrections , clarifications , etc , from my more learned readers . ) 	0
OC	7258	( Certainly I have a good many ideas that some feminists , many of whom identify as radfem , consider " radical " in the pejorative sense , but that ' s another can of worms . ) 	0

PE	7592	Simply put , charging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful . 	1
PE	7593	In conclusion , " rush hours " are usually not the direct consequence of drivers . 	1
PE	7594	Sometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light , or unreasonable organization of roadways . 	0
PE	7595	In these cases , the one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner , not drivers . 	0
PE	7596	Majority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance , and charging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights . 	0
PE	7597	Rather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee , government should instead , be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental-friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil . 	1
PE	7598	Buying a car spends hundreds of thousand ; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several-these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear . 	0
PE	7599	Charging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous . 	1
PE	7600	Instead , the real causes of traffic jam may fall on various of grounds , and therefore , charging drivers for another fee for this could be unreasonable and irrational . 	1
PE	7601	Tourist often decide to discover the culture of a country when they visit through those old buildings . 	0
PE	7602	Therefore , managers of cities can earn more money from the attraction provided by old buildings and that amount can be spent on their conservation . 	1
PE	7603	In my opinion , all of the old building which contribute to our sense of culture should be conserved . 	1
PE	7604	There are different reasons which persuade that people should not restore old buildings . 	0
PE	7605	Old buildings should be preserved 	0
PE	7606	The preservation of old buildings always is a large question for governments because conflict between the issues of housing for citizens and the protection of our culture . 	0
PE	7607	Besides that , the preservation is very expensive because all components of old buildings have historical values . 	0
PE	7608	Old buildings are an essential part of history . 	0
PE	7609	As a result of the rapid urbanization process , in which rural people must go to urban centers to look for job opportunities , the question of the preservation of old buildings has become more pressing . 	0
PE	7610	Because of that need , governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings . 	1
PE	7611	Developing globalization , people can have more access to many natural resources of the world and it leads to increasing the pace of scientific and economic promotions of the entire world . 	0
PE	7612	During the history of the world , every change has its own positive and negative sides . 	0
PE	7613	However , the jury giving the verdict are also humans . 	0
PE	7614	They have the life of a person at their discretion . 	0
PE	7615	They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent , circumstantially marred criminals . 	1
PE	7616	The jury must therefore , take into account the circumstances of committing a crime . 	0
PE	7617	When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment , they will fear and not commit such crimes . 	0
PE	7618	Thus , the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased . 	1
PE	7619	Importantly , capital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals . 	0
PE	7620	Criminals who don ' t have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are , therefore , given capital punishment . 	1
PE	7621	For example , if an individual murders someone for self-defense , then such a crime is not heinous . 	0
PE	7622	Only deserving criminals , who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment . 	0
PE	7623	Taking part in the study groups would increase student ' s motivation to study more . 	1
PE	7624	In a word , attending boys and girls in a same school would bring many advantages . 	1
PE	7625	In addition , they would be able to know the opposite gender , which help them to be prepared for the adult life where they almost will live or work together . 	1
PE	7626	Boys and girls will try to show their capabilities and abilities in the class , therefore they will study increasingly . 	0
PE	7627	Moreover , attending in the school having boys and girls might be beneficial for both to increase their motivation to study better . 	1
PE	7628	As a result , the productivity of the class will be increased . 	0
PE	7629	Indeed , Boys do not like to seem weak in front of girls and vice versa . 	0
PE	7630	So , communicating in single language will reduce the problems of travelers in daily activities like ordering food in a restaurant or in going around places . 	0
PE	7631	Due to globalization , many people are traveling for professional trips . 	0
PE	7632	As a consequence , various local languages are becoming extinct . 	0
PE	7633	Its usage is increasing day by day . 	0
PE	7634	Today , English is commonly used language across the world . 	0
PE	7635	Various local languages are becoming extinct 	0
PE	7636	A world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way . 	1
PE	7637	In my opinion , I believe using single language through out the world is a positive change which is helping the world to become a better place to live . 	1
PE	7638	While there are others who disagree with this and are more concerned about dying local languages . 	0
PE	7639	Some people argue that , this is a positive change and would help people to easily communicate . 	0
PE	7640	These days , most of countries on the world invest for technology . 	0
PE	7641	Traditional skills and ways are always valuable and will last forever 	0
PE	7642	Many people think that conventional things will not exist and should be eliminated . 	0
PE	7643	It is evident that technology promotes economy . 	0
PE	7644	First of all , traditional skills and ways belong to value of culture . 	1
PE	7645	I totally disagree this opinion . 	0
PE	7646	Every country has unique tradtions which show their creation , intelligence . 	0
PE	7647	They make differences between countries . 	0
PE	7648	For example , ways to build a house in every country are different and they distinguish between countries . 	0
PE	7649	Consequently , people feel pround of their country , so they keep reserving conventions . 	0
PE	7650	In conclusion , considering the rise in accident rates , violent crime rates and suicide rates , I support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence . 	1
PE	7651	Finally , a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented . 	1
PE	7652	As astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in , scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks . 	0
PE	7653	By observing planet earth from outer space , people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth . 	0
PE	7654	With this knowledge , people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming . 	0
PE	7655	As a conclusion , I personally think that human beings should travel to outer space . 	1
PE	7656	In spite of costing a fortune , space exploration has given aforementioned benefits . 	0
PE	7657	Oxygen tanks , for instance , are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater . 	0
PE	7658	Moreover , spaceships , communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society . 	0
PE	7659	It will help people around the world understand each other more . 	0
PE	7660	Since , international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way . 	1
PE	7661	When many people congregate in one place , I think that some kinds of social problems will follow . 	0
PE	7662	International sporting events are a good change to create a multi-nation community of fans having the same passion . 	0
PE	7663	In conclusion , university restriction has both pros and cons . 	0
PE	7664	Apart from the disheartened ones , many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs , mostly the white-collar ones . 	0
PE	7665	What is more , there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people . 	1
PE	7666	Therefore , it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people , who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively . 	1
PE	7667	That ' s why it should be made available for a wide range of learners . 	1
PE	7668	In my opinion , it will yield more negative results than positive ones . 	1
PE	7669	Moreover , when people have jobs , they will have money to spend on goods and services . 	0
PE	7670	For the time of occasions , people regardless of nationality , origin and religion will live together . 	0
PE	7671	It is inevitable to be exposed to the environment full of advertisements but it does not mean that our right to choose is taken away . 	0
PE	7672	Besides , advertising might lead to healthier eating customs due to the growing awareness of living under a better lifestyle . 	1
PE	7673	We will always be able to decide our own lifestyles . 	0
PE	7674	Health education will help people to have right choices of treatment to recover more quickly . 	0
PE	7675	Many diseases which may be cured easily can turn to serious ones if we do not have right treatment . 	0
PE	7676	Instead of afraid or panic , they may be calmer if unfortunately committing some normal diseases such as allergy or illness in seasonal changes . 	0
PE	7677	Secondly , health education will prepare for people especially children necessary knowledge to protect themselves from risks of diseases . 	0
PE	7678	For example , if a child is educated to have a hygienic lifestyle at a very young age , he also keeps it when older . 	0
PE	7679	First of all , thank to a full health education from their childhoods , children will have good habits of taking care of their own health and these habits may be kept in their adolescences . 	0
PE	7680	Health education causes long-term positive effects on our next generations . 	1
PE	7681	Once applied , it will bring many benefits to both citizens and governments . 	0
PE	7682	It is a completely right and extremely wise policy to focus on health education and preventative measures rather than treatment . 	1
PE	7683	Prevention is better than cure 	0
PE	7684	It is are easy and usable . 	1
PE	7685	In my point of view , listening to music , exercising , and doing meditation are the most activities that people could do to escape from stress . 	1
PE	7686	In conclusion , there are many ways to reduce the stress . 	0
PE	7687	These could relieve me from stress . 	0
PE	7688	A way to do meditation is that I just sit down , close my eyes , and count my breath . 	0
PE	7689	Meditation is easy way to relax because it is not require any equipment , and it take few minutes . 	0
PE	7690	when I have many things to think about , and this make me stress , I will do meditation . 	0
PE	7691	Third , meditation also one of the ways to reduce the stress . 	1
PE	7692	And everyone should find the time to do more and more to feel better physically and in everyone mind . 	1
PE	7693	The main reason why I believe artists should be funded is because art helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists . 	0
PE	7694	For example , monuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city ' s history and culture , but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists . 	0
PE	7695	In fact , some countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue , thus , the governments should help arts because their work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry . 	1
PE	7696	In addition , sculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation . 	0
PE	7697	Funding artists 	0
PE	7698	Nowadays , in order to save as much budget as possible and improve the economy of the country , every government around the world is seeking for some ways to spend wisely . 	0
PE	7699	Therefore , there is a suggestion that governments should not continue to fund the artists , but they ought to spend money on other necessary subjects such as medical research and space . 	0
PE	7700	In my view , I firmly disagree with this recommendation due to several reasons . 	0
PE	7701	Therefore , culture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art . 	1
PE	7702	Young people are also able to get more knowledge about their country ' s history and culture by observing various work crafts . 	0
PE	7703	With the rapid development of the standard of people ' s life , increasing numbers of animal experiments are done , new medicines and foods , for instance . 	0
PE	7704	Using animals for the benefit of the human beings 	0
PE	7705	In my essay , I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects . 	0
PE	7706	Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature , however , I believe that no sensible person will deny that it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals . 	1
PE	7707	The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals . 	0
PE	7708	First of all , as we all know , animals are friendly and vital for people , because if there are no animals in the world , the balance of nature will broke down , and we , human , will die out as well . 	0
PE	7709	Though animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance , it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life . 	0
PE	7710	In other words , doing this various testing is a hazard of human ' s future and next generation . 	1
PE	7711	The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human ' s life . 	0
PE	7712	To begin with , it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious , and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying . 	1
PE	7713	In conclusion , there are abovementioned three key points of positive effects of aid ; supporting poor countries to make its economy strong and building humane concepts to people , keeping strong global economy . 	1
PE	7714	When America mortgage loan system went bad , several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated , even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt . 	0
PE	7715	In globalized world , the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others . 	0
PE	7716	Third , the campaigns might include practical benefits . 	1
PE	7717	It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love , but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization . 	0
PE	7718	If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases , they would never take their abundance for granted . 	0
PE	7719	Secondly , aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people . 	1
PE	7720	Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties . 	0
PE	7721	there are certain period of time for teachers to teach . 	0
PE	7722	I strongly believe that being a global neighbor by aiding poor countries would be continues by many organizations and volunteers , and it will make the earth a better place to live . 	1
PE	7723	In the zoo you can see an animal and their different variations , the male and the female or the baby and the adult . 	0
PE	7724	If you visit the zoo , you get to watch the animals , their customs , what they eat and how they eat it , as well as which characteristics the different species have . 	0
PE	7725	We can learn a lot from books and lectures , but there is an even better way to learn , that is visuals and personal experience . 	0
PE	7726	Animals , the different species , their habitats and behaviors are a subject of study at schools and universities . 	0
PE	7727	Finally , a visit to the zoo will help increasing someone ' s respect and appreciation for animals . 	1
PE	7728	Visiting the zoo would help the students understand what they learn at school . 	1
PE	7729	Moreover , it will also help identify which animals could be dangerous . 	0
PE	7730	It offers a great opportunity to observe their reactions to different situations , such as weather , specie and genre interaction , defense behavior , or protection of their babies . 	0
PE	7731	This is especially true for people living in the city , where the only animals they normally interact with are pets like cats and dogs . 	0
PE	7732	It is a lot easier to appreciate something after you have seen it , and learned from it . 	0
PE	7733	Should teachers be paid according to how much their students learn ? 	0
PE	7734	Moreover , another daily expense is also the considerable outgoings . 	0
PE	7735	Furthermore , museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages ; therefore , these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture . 	1
PE	7736	It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos , so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it . 	0
PE	7737	On the one hand , technology indeed simplifies people ' s life all the time . 	0
PE	7738	Although modern technology make it possible , I still believe some museums and art galleries will not disappear . 	1
PE	7739	It is quite common that more and more people can watch exhibitions through television or internet at home due to modern technology ; therefore , some people think museums and art galleries will disappear soon . 	0
PE	7740	Museums and art galleries will disappear soon ? 	0
PE	7741	First of all , authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos . 	0
PE	7742	On the other hand , the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture . 	1
PE	7743	However , in accordance with recent research , experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy because they lack of physical exercise and face-to-face communication . 	0
PE	7744	Obviously , people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home , save the time and money on the road , which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society . 	1
PE	7745	Because I could find a better way to solve problems . 	0
PE	7746	In conclusion , experiences that shape my thinking and the way to live my life are teach me to be a better person . 	1
PE	7747	This experience change me to concern about making plan for my future life . 	0
PE	7748	Consequently , I start changing myself from spending many thing that I want to saving money for my entire life . 	0
PE	7749	These experiences taught me to change my life to be a better person . 	1
PE	7750	Moreover , these experiences could make me to make plan for my future life . 	0
PE	7751	Besides , experiences could shape me to be more aware about my health . 	0
PE	7752	Therefore , instead of interfering children ' s creativity , technology actually encourages children to learn and to create . 	1
PE	7753	It is true that TV is one of the prime source of data and information . 	0
PE	7754	There are international and local news channels like BBC , CNBC , Etv Gujarati , Etv Marathi etc to keep individuals updated about latest happenings . 	0
PE	7755	By watching TV , children can develop skills in extra-curriculum activities . 	1
PE	7756	For example , Cooking programs teach about how to make new dishes and similarly , sports events like cricket , football can teach leadership skills , team building skills , communication skills and many more that can help students in their future jobs . 	0
PE	7757	Children can effectively learn from watching television 	0
PE	7758	TV is an immense source of information and pupils can learn and develop various skills by watching it . 	0
PE	7759	But I believe that by allowing students to watch TV at both school and house can adversely impact on their overall growth . 	1
PE	7760	If children spend too much time in front of TV , it will negatively impact their health and study . 	1
PE	7761	Technology has made life too easy for most children . 	0
PE	7762	But on other hand , watching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health . 	1
PE	7763	For example , they can get poor eyesight in early ages of childhood , and also develop back pain . 	0
PE	7764	Nonetheless , passion on jobs , in my opinion , can bring actual happiness and help us get promoted in working to earn even more money later on . 	1
PE	7765	In conclusion , it is undeniable that income is still a vital determination impacting us on choices of careers . 	1
PE	7766	Finally , some people choose a career due to their desire to help others and contribute positively to their countries and societies . 	0
PE	7767	Besides , important factors in choosing a job such as level of happiness , satisfaction of jobs , personal relationships , professional skills , working environment , managers and colleagues should not be underestimated . 	0
PE	7768	Computer was invented for the benefit of mankind and it has fulfilled its objective . 	0
PE	7769	Human life today can ' t be imagined without computers , so not depending on them is out of question . 	0
PE	7770	Thus , dependence on computers is not a bad thing . 	1
PE	7771	However , one needs to be aware of all the pros and cons and beware of malicious things . 	0
PE	7772	The recent case of Wikileaks , leaking confidential data is an example of how computers are harmful . 	0
PE	7773	Nevertheless , with all the mentioned demerits , computers have provided security and sophistication too . 	1
PE	7774	They have even invaded mental health of humans , for example , FAD ( Facebook Addiction Disorder - excessive use of social networking website Facebook ) . 	0
PE	7775	Computers have intruded our lives to the effect that a satellite can peep into our homes and privates lives . 	0
PE	7776	From my point of view , computers have an important and inevitable role in economic , business , and other part of societies . 	1
PE	7777	However , some people especially young ones use computers extremely and this excessive usage lead to increase stress among them , but computers have brought many advantages to our lives . 	0
PE	7778	Computers have revolutionized our lifestyle during last century . 	0
PE	7779	People benefit more from coming computers into their lives 	0
PE	7780	Many industries use computers to command to robots in order to do many regular tasks , which were carried out by human early . 	0
PE	7781	Nowadays , computer can control and perform some routine activities in industries , which were early done by human . 	0
PE	7782	Admittedly , by using computers in many industries human ' s role has been reduced . 	0
PE	7783	In addition , they make the way of living easier by doing our routine duties . 	1
PE	7784	In addition , car companies use computers to simulate and analyze car accident by computers . 	0
PE	7785	For example , many processes of production of cars are carrying out by robots , which are controlled by computers . 	0
PE	7786	Unfortunately , the unstoppable trend of urbanization makes me only appreciate parts of those classic buildings in the pictures or in museums . 	0
PE	7787	I will discuss my view in two main areas . 	0
PE	7788	Old buildings are reminders of a city ' s culture and complexity . 	0
PE	7789	Historic buildings have intrinsic values , because they are significant symbols of a city . 	1
PE	7790	Here are some reasons and examples to illustrate my viewpoint . 	0
PE	7791	We certainly do not hope for a reduction for these sorts of taxes . 	0
PE	7792	It would be highly unpractical to ask people to adopt a simpler way of life . 	0
PE	7793	The biggest risk is not taking any risk 	0
PE	7794	" The biggest risk is not taking any risk . " 	0
PE	7795	The ones who have a big dream , they need to be brave and dare to live new situations . 	0
PE	7796	It is not guaranteed that you are going to achieve your dream if you had planned carefully as the same way when you take risks , but it is more frustrating if you had made plans and then it went wrong . 	0
PE	7797	Therefore , it is essential to take chances and believe this is going to work out . 	1
PE	7798	Assuming new opportunities is indispensable to have diverse experiences . 	1
PE	7799	In fact , life may not be easy ; it will have various challenges especially when you take risks , but in the end , it can be surprisingly wonderful . 	0
PE	7800	Also , they can save value things in their life such as time and money , and enjoy they life with the best way . 	0
PE	7801	In the beginning , it can be tough to fit in this new place and find any opportunity , but after fighting against the obstacles blocking the way to get what is desired ; it is possible to conquer what they are craving as well as start to build a new life in this other country . 	0
PE	7802	In fact , many people are afraid to take risks and fail . 	0
PE	7803	Moreover , I have always believed that parents and adults relatives are the best friends and consular for the teenagers , because unfortunately nowadays there are some individuals who cheat the others for gaining more power and money . 	1
PE	7804	As a result , experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time . 	1
PE	7805	What ' s more , people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles . 	1
PE	7806	From my point of view , I am in favor the former statement that some tough experiences people met before will be helpful in their life path . 	1
PE	7807	To start with , hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their life such as , a shining weather , a delicious breakfast and etc . People who have such nice spirit usually know how to find the true love in their life instead of being seduced by greed as to lose themselves in the end . 	0
PE	7808	For that reason , some people advocate that some difficulties people met at their early ages will become an invaluable fortune in their future lives . 	0
PE	7809	However , some people think it isn ' t supposed to be that case . 	0
PE	7810	Most difficult experiences will become valuable lessons 	0
PE	7811	There is a famous old saying that failure is the mother of success . 	0
PE	7812	Because they already have such experiences of overcoming some difficulties , they are conscious of what to do and how to do when fierce crisis happens . 	0
PE	7813	Those people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career because they are aware of how to lead people to reach success despite what kind of difficulties are getting in their way . 	0
PE	7814	To sum up , I have to concede to the materialistic diversion from treatment to health education and preventative measures . 	1
PE	7815	This will yield positive results on not only the people ' s physical and mental development but also their finance . 	1
PE	7816	Experiences that have shaped your outlook and the way you live 	0
PE	7817	What is more , the ever-increasing huntings are having a heavy toll on rare and specious species . 	0
PE	7818	Only when zoos appear are such distinction-driven animals as : giraffe , panda , koala or leopard provided with their own inaccessible territory . 	0
PE	7819	In sum , the role of zoos towards both human and animals is undeniably indispensable . 	1
PE	7820	It is highly recommended that zoos should be seen with different perspective in order to function at their most efficiency . 	0
PE	7821	Many circumstances that I experienced change the way I think . 	1
PE	7822	A number of people then may come from any other communities in order to get in to or get the jobs at the university . 	0
PE	7823	For example , when I go to office , I use public transport . 	0
PE	7824	I see many things such as traffic jam , crowded people at bus stop , and all so crowded people in buses . 	0
PE	7825	Thus , many people try to reduce their stress . 	0
PE	7826	There are many activities that could relieve those people who are in stress . 	0
PE	7827	in my opinion , reducing stress by listening to music , playing sports , and doing meditation are easy and practical ways . 	1
PE	7828	First of all , listening to music is a great way to relax . 	1
PE	7829	Best ways of reducing stress : listening to music , exercise , meditation 	0
PE	7830	Nowadays , we are living in in the world which is absolutely complicated . 	0
PE	7831	Everything seem to be rush , and it have a lot of competition . 	0
PE	7832	These make people get stress . 	0
PE	7833	I will give reasons to support my opinion . 	0
PE	7834	To begin with , studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems . 	1
PE	7835	Others believe that television , newspapers and magazines should keep us entertained and therefore they should pay attention to famous people lives as well . 	0
PE	7836	Getting to know the theory in this area seems really important for our students . 	0
PE	7837	Then , the earlier we jump into this area , the more skillful we will be . 	0
PE	7838	Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field 	0
PE	7839	In today ' s community , economy becomes the order of the day . 	0
PE	7840	For the primary concern , it can provide students a sense of direction in academy . 	1
PE	7841	Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field , let them to know what this subject mainly discuss . 	0
PE	7842	Thus , in my point of view , although it will take some time on it , high school students should take a course on basic economics . 	1
PE	7843	Let me explain it in detail . 	0
PE	7844	That will help the students cultivate their own interest and a sense of career orientation . 	0
PE	7845	Finally , students may study harder for their economic dreams . 	0
PE	7846	The third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted . 	1
PE	7847	Moreover , in terms of punishment , living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away . 	0
PE	7848	Secondly , capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes , life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives . 	1
PE	7849	In addition , execution does not resolve the consequences of crime , not to mention it could put the criminal ' s family through hardship while the pain of the victim ' s kin is never to be consoled . 	0
PE	7850	Although what criminals cause to the society , specifically to the victims , is indeed significantly offensive , they are humans and their lives need to be valued . 	0
PE	7851	First of all , it is recognized that every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life . 	1
PE	7852	However , as the society grows , human rights become more highly respected , " murdering " criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept . 	1
PE	7853	In a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred , it may be true that the death penalty is an efficient retribution to admonish the violence . 	0
PE	7854	Capital punishment is a controversial debate in many countries . 	0
PE	7855	Capital punishment is necessary or not ? 	0
PE	7856	Nowadays , unscrupulous paparazzi constantly follow celebrities just to take a photo while they are eating or training . 	0
PE	7857	Newspapers often receive accusations of checkbook journalism ; this means that magazines pay people a lot of money for stories or photos . 	0
PE	7858	To conclude , Earth is our home and it should be protected . 	1
PE	7859	Any human activity causing harm to Earth should be controlled and alternate ways should be devised to control damage . 	0
PE	7860	Creative ideas should be encouraged to leave minimum environmental footprints without compromising quality of life . 	0
PE	7861	To add to it , excess emission of carbon dioxide gas mainly by vehicles around the world has increased the average temperature at north pole which in turn has increased water level due to gradual melting of glaciers . 	0
PE	7862	Lastly , either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth . 	1
PE	7863	For instance a large amount of unnoticed industrial waste released in oceans effects aquatic life to a large extent . 	0
PE	7864	Harmful chemicals present in industrial waste kills lot of sea creatures in oceans or rivers . 	0
PE	7865	Besides , there is also an intimate connection between economy and enterprises , students can also gain knowledge more practical and vivid . 	1
PE	7866	Also , we can avoid conflicts among students and teachers which can be enjoyable and productive for both instructor and students . 	0
PE	7867	Next , students should choose their classes to have progress in their studies and grades . 	0
PE	7868	As children of independent country we should know our rights and opportunities we have in order to achieve our goals and dreams . 	0
PE	7869	Not allowing students their desired subjects to be chosen is a restriction of human rights . 	0
PE	7870	First of all , as I mentioned above students should have a right to choose what they want to study . 	1
PE	7871	In my opinion high school should permit students to choose courses they want for several reasons which are freedom of choice , to have progress in students grades and knowledge as well as to help students explore their aptitude . 	1
PE	7872	High school is the time when you decide your future career and particular field you want to concentrate and interested in . 	0
PE	7873	Educated high-school students with bright and independent mind 	0
PE	7874	Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit . 	1
PE	7875	For example , when I was taking art class everyone shared the same interests and it was easy to understand each other . 	0
PE	7876	Setting up a council to monitor the media information to the public could be a practical idea . 	0
PE	7877	Playing baseball provided my upper body for hitting and throwing . 	0
PE	7878	Soccer , on the other hand , developed my lower body for kicking and endurance for playing full 90-minute-games . 	0
PE	7879	Taking the SARS in 2003 as an example , the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths . 	0
PE	7880	Even so , another perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest . 	0
PE	7881	The major opposing argument is to protect the safety of citizens . 	0
PE	7882	In other words , the government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner , especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases . 	1
PE	7883	Some people prefer to spend their free time indoors . 	0
PE	7884	But from my experience , I myself prefer to spend my leisure time outdoors because I strongly feel that it is good for health and keep my body fit . 	1
PE	7885	Leisure activities - Spend your free time outdoors or indoors . 	0
PE	7886	People often relax themselves by joining leisure activities . 	0
PE	7887	One benefit is that doing outdoor activities such as soccer and baseball is good for one ' s health . 	1
PE	7888	For instance , last year , I spent my summer time playing soccer and baseball . 	0
PE	7889	Also , outdoor activities enable me to socialize with other people and enjoy natural beauty . 	1
PE	7890	There are strong advantages to spend leisure time outdoors . 	0
PE	7891	Obviously , it is waste of time . 	0
PE	7892	People need to put much more effort to keep their living condition . 	0
PE	7893	Therefore , lives in the old days is easier than today . 	1
PE	7894	They must take only a bus to go to another place . 	0
PE	7895	If a subway and a sky train are available here , it will be more convenience to them . 	0
PE	7896	For example , people can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule . 	0
PE	7897	On the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus . 	0
PE	7898	Also , this improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly . 	1
PE	7899	Secondly , the buses provide merely two routes in this community . 	0
PE	7900	It is absolutely a major problem . 	0
PE	7901	For example , if a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses , I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus . 	0
PE	7902	Many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to lives therefore it should be considered a positive activity while others have held a complete different idea about this . 	0
PE	7903	Both views will be critiqued before a reasonable conclusion is drawn . 	0
PE	7904	Advertising - positive or negative part of our lives 	0
PE	7905	Nowadays , the use of advertisement through different forms of media such as newspapers , radio and television has become very prevalent , so it is thought to be a necessary part of today ' s society . 	0
PE	7906	Also , to consumers , advertising can bring them many benefits . 	1
PE	7907	For example , customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans . 	0
PE	7908	First , it is generally understood that advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more . 	0
PE	7909	Advertisements are , therefore , very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits . 	1
PE	7910	From all of these , it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support . 	0
PE	7911	However , it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts . 	0
PE	7912	Children should grow up in a big city ! 	0
PE	7913	Taking IT industry for an example , top technical science is published in English . 	0
PE	7914	Furthermore , researchers , especially those who work on high-tech , would have wider range of references if they are good at English . 	0
PE	7915	Computers and modems bring works to home but these still have many things distract their mind . 	1
PE	7916	Doing all jobs at home don ' t make employees attempt to work like this . 	1
PE	7917	Hence , the culture heritage and nation identity vanish . 	1
PE	7918	Admittedly , opponents may blame that English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year . 	0
PE	7919	In conclusion , in spite of some negative effects , I ' m totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around . 	1
PE	7920	However , this is really short-sighted , ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society . 	0
PE	7921	But at the same time , actions , like recording , can be taken to protect native languages and cultures . 	0
PE	7922	I suggest all youths should learn English owing to its key role in globalization . 	0
PE	7923	Some people think that working at home brings to workers and employees too much convenience , but i don ' t . 	0
PE	7924	Computers have made it possible for office workers to do their work 	0
PE	7925	Then again , the workers must try their best to finish the time limit . 	0
PE	7926	The directors manage employers and give them the deadline of projects . 	0
PE	7927	Each office has its rules that keep workers do their job as effectively as possible . 	0
PE	7928	Pressure is motivation . 	0
PE	7929	I have a friend that grew up in the countryside . 	0
PE	7930	He said that he had to study a lot to pass the test to enter the university . 	0
PE	7931	Moreover they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training . 	0
PE	7932	In addition , the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination , which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan . 	0
PE	7933	The purpose of this essay is to discuss what can students and the organizations benefit from the activity that the students sent by their schools to work for companies without salaries . 	0
PE	7934	Benefits of students ' unpaid work 	0
PE	7935	To begin with , students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to . 	1
PE	7936	In this essay , I would start by analyzing the advantages for doing this for both students and companies , and then I would draw a conclusion at the end . 	0
PE	7937	As a result , students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation . 	0
PE	7938	In most school curriculums , the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom . 	0
PE	7939	As for the companies , the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money . 	0
PE	7940	For this reason , the internship , although without pay , can give them the experiences that money cannot buy . 	0
PE	7941	I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy . 	0
PE	7942	In contrast , it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment . 	0
PE	7943	Based on the reasons demonstrated above , I believe that living in a higher pace is better because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite . 	1
PE	7944	In other words , I prefer to live in high pace . 	1
PE	7945	For instance , I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition , defeating those spending less time on practicing . 	0
PE	7946	Hence , from this case we are capable of stating that keeping our pace higher is important . 	1
PE	7947	Admittedly , on the other hand , there might be some people proclaiming that with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more because it is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed . 	1
PE	7948	However , from my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying . 	0
PE	7949	It is not to say , of course that other points of view are totally without merit . 	0
PE	7950	Still , I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and plausible . 	0
PE	7951	He looked at every aspect that he needed to qualify for the promotion . 	0
PE	7952	For example , my boss worked tirelessly for his promotion . 	0
PE	7953	Although there are valid arguments to the contrary , it is my belief that the majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication . 	1
PE	7954	Yet , there remains some disagreement as to whether the overall effect of this innovation has been positive or negative . 	0
PE	7955	With the click of a button , the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds . 	0
PE	7956	To begin with , mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business . 	0
PE	7957	With a mobile phone or a laptop , a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop , in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine . 	0
PE	7958	Furthermore , it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world . 	0
PE	7959	Nevertheless , opponents of modern communications claim that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits . 	0
PE	7960	Therefore , it seems that these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind . 	1
PE	7961	If you believe in luck , you would be clueless about where you are heading . 	0
PE	7962	They carefully organize the process of achieving their targets and continue to evaluate their progress until they reach the final goal . 	0
PE	7963	He was living in an illusion that he can solve his financial issues with this lottery . 	0
PE	7964	For example , a friend of mine , who had severe financial constraints , had the habit of buying lottery tickets thinking that one day he would win a lottery . 	0
PE	7965	Thirdly , if you work hard , luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target . 	1
PE	7966	However , up to this day his luck has not appeared and problems have got further worsened . 	0
PE	7967	To sum up , although supporting art will benefit the human beings and the company in short-term interest , I still hold the environment protection for long-term interest . 	1
PE	7968	Biodiversity and a more beautiful nature are not only the results of abetter environment but also are the necessities of photography and other types of art . 	0
PE	7969	I confess that art is one of the best ways of entertaining human beings , but , with exhaust fumes and acid rain , we do not have the energy and enthusiasm to appreciate the paintings or photographs . 	0
PE	7970	Finally , conservation leads us to a higher standard of living . 	1
PE	7971	Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers . 	0
PE	7972	However , the current job market affects the decision of universities . 	0
PE	7973	They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission . 	0
PE	7974	Furthermore , university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination . 	0
PE	7975	They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling , teaching , designing etc . Therefore , universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender . 	1
PE	7976	They prefer male staff for night shifts . 	0
PE	7977	For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine . 	0
PE	7978	The job selection criteria are pre decided . 	0
PE	7979	When you run into a problem , you can ask your roommates if they can help . 	0
PE	7980	It often is the case that your roommates have the skills or knowledge you need . 	0
PE	7981	To illustrate , when my computer mysteriously broke down , I dialed up the manufacturer and asked for help . 	0
PE	7982	Some of them may have something to offer . 	0
PE	7983	To my surprise , one of my roommates noticed my problems and offered to help . 	0
PE	7984	They failed to give me any useful solutions . 	0
PE	7985	In conclusion , while many people decide to live alone for various reasons , I prefer to live with a roommate , and I always will . 	1
PE	7986	He was very good with computers , and he managed to fix the problem quickly . 	0
PE	7987	I think single people should live with a roommate , if they want to enjoy their lives . 	0
PE	7988	This is because it offers me many advantages , such as less spending , more socializing , and more help . 	1
PE	7989	Instead , he hardly cared about something else . 	0
PE	7990	For instance , Albert Einstein , one of the most competent physicians in history , devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity . 	0
PE	7991	Although , they will not be having a pace and an eager to get on the top as the competitors do , but they shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team . 	1
PE	7992	If student do it by themselves , they might be hurt themselves . 	0
PE	7993	Classroom have specialist trainer to teach students to it right way . 	0
PE	7994	Lastly , learning in classroom , student could have healthier life because in school can provide exercise class which train student to move their body . 	1
PE	7995	This important skill cannot be gotten in online classes . 	0
PE	7996	On the other hand , the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory . 	0
PE	7997	For instance , In a classroom , teacher could give assignment to student to work as a group . 	0
PE	7998	Secondly , online class could not provide knowledge about social skills . 	1
PE	7999	Unlike classroom , online class just only study in textbook not learnin real situation . 	0
PE	8000	First of all , through cooperation , children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students . 	1
PE	8001	From this point of view , I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education . 	1
PE	8002	During the process of cooperation , children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others , how to communicate with others , how to think comprehensively , and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred . 	0
PE	8003	What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly , how to get along with others . 	0
PE	8004	It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy . 	0
PE	8005	Should students be taught to compete or to cooperate ? 	0
PE	8006	In conclusion , I personally disagree this this notion that we should replace classroom with online class . 	1
PE	8007	This make students have healthier life which online class cannot provide . 	0
PE	8008	There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset . 	0
PE	8009	Finally , psychology knows two types of motivation . 	0
PE	8010	Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects , the better they perform in academic areas . 	0
PE	8011	With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency . 	0
PE	8012	Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning . 	0
PE	8013	In addition , being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life . 	1
PE	8014	Thus they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently . 	0
PE	8015	By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching . 	0
PE	8016	This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic . 	0
PE	8017	Secondly , some students might learn better at home on their own , for instance , by reading the textbook . 	1
PE	8018	This is because language can be seen as much more than just one method of communication . 	0
PE	8019	Despite of the above arguments , i still strongly believe that the government should try to preserve minority languages . 	1
PE	8020	I personally suppose that no matter how widely they are spoken , every language should be protected from being disappeared . 	1
PE	8021	The question whether our government should make an effort to preserve them by investing more money on that minority languages or not is still a debatable one . 	0
PE	8022	It is true that the increasing number of languages which are at risk of extinction has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today ' s society are very concerned for . 	0
PE	8023	Languages ' extinction , discuss both views 	0
PE	8024	Secondly , it is obvious that in many aspects such as communication , trade , cooperation as well as transaction , it will be absolutely easier for the whole society to work together in one language only . 	1
PE	8025	For example , some certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese , so the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers , facilities and appropriate materials . 	0
PE	8026	Firstly , we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages , it can be really expensive because educational programmes will need to be given so as to keep young people learning and using them . 	0
PE	8027	There are several reasons why saving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money . 	1
PE	8028	The company only needs some technicians to make sure machines are working on the right track or replace some part when machines are not working . 	0
PE	8029	However , the disadvantages of machines that bring to us should not be neglected by people . 	1
PE	8030	For another , using machines can save company ' s money . 	0
PE	8031	Because machines never ask for salary , over-time pay or pension , so employers do not need to spend money on employee ' s welfare . 	0
PE	8032	For one thing , machines are more effective than human . 	0
PE	8033	Not like human , machines do not need rest , which means they can work as long as employers want and consistently produce high quality products without any mistakes . 	0
PE	8034	In my opinion , although using machines have many benefits , we cannot ignore its negative effects . 	1
PE	8035	It is undoubted that machines can bring many benefits . 	1
PE	8036	Advantages and disadvantages of machines instead of human to do the work 	0
PE	8037	The issue of whether using of machine are bring many advantages to society is of great concern to many people . 	0
PE	8038	People will spend less time on cooking food 	0
PE	8039	However , I do think that people are likely to spend less time in cooking food . 	1
PE	8040	The first and foremost reason is that with the development of science and technology , more advanced kitchen facilities , such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers , have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time . 	0
PE	8041	There are various reasons why I maintain this viewpoint , and among those reasons are two important ones . 	0
PE	8042	Actually , in recent years , there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valuable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework . 	0
PE	8043	As a result , people nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two , even three hours like in the last 10 years . 	0
PE	8044	He would miss various childhood activities such as hang out with friends , clubs and fun activities and social interaction with others . 	0
PE	8045	They have whole life to do job and prove themselves , but the childhood phase will never return in their life . 	0
PE	8046	Moreover , they drop out their studies so as to earn more money . 	0
PE	8047	In addition to this , the main drawback of teenagers job is that , they miss out the fun of their childhood time . 	0
PE	8048	They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money . 	0
PE	8049	This would affect their studies , they loose their interest from studies . 	0
PE	8050	Another reason , jobs can divert students from their studies . 	1
PE	8051	If students started earning in earlier age in their life , then they get attracted towards money . 	0
PE	8052	They won ' t be able to get proper time for relaxation , sleep . 	0
PE	8053	Thus , would affect their mental and physical health . 	1
PE	8054	Ancient people would probably think that we are like magicians . 	0
PE	8055	As we know , there are impoverished or disabled people in every society , needing help and support from others . 	0
PE	8056	However , I would argue that citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax . 	1
PE	8057	Although these workers do not produce profit directly , what they do is for the well-being of the whole society . 	0
PE	8058	The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors , such as teachers and police officers . 	0
PE	8059	For example , a large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability , so that every one can work and live in a peaceful environment . 	0
PE	8060	To start with , all people who are able to work should pay tax to the government , as it is the most important source of government ' s revenue , which is mainly used to serve all citizens . 	1
PE	8061	Personally , I tend to disagree with this view . 	0
PE	8062	Some people believe that they have made enough contribution to the country by doing that . 	0
PE	8063	Paying taxes is the obligation of citizens in almost every country . 	0
PE	8064	Paying taxes is enough contribution from citizens 	0
PE	8065	In conclusion , it is indeed evident that age limit should be set for retirement . 	1
PE	8066	There will come a certain time when the older generation should hand over the responsibility to the fresh comers who are certainly waiting to be given a choice to prove themselves . 	0
PE	8067	Their invaluable experiences and knowledge in their respective fields such as engineering , medicine , and law can certainly be beneficial to the younger generation . 	0
PE	8068	Hence , it is highly recommended that the retiree come over to the companies or hospitals to have regular sessions with the present staffs to bridge the gap between them and to pass on their knowledge . 	0
PE	8069	Thus , it would indeed be better if at an older age , opportunities are given to the younger ones . 	1
PE	8070	Admittedly , the expertise of the senior workers who had retired should never be underestimated . 	1
PE	8071	Consequently , they will not be able to give their best in whatever they are doing . 	0
PE	8072	Besides , the academic institution will have to pay for his medical bills , resulting in more loss for the institution . 	0
PE	8073	Beyond that age , a large proportion of them have an elevated chance of contracting a multitude of health problems such as stress related diseases and cardiovascular illnesses . 	0
PE	8074	To cite an example , the stressful life that an aged teacher goes through will definitely take a toll on him . 	0
PE	8075	In my hometown , I have a lot of friends and good relationships , I love the traffic in here , and the environment is wonderful . 	1
PE	8076	I prefer to spend my entire live in one place which is my hometown . 	1
PE	8077	Some people may prefer to live in different places at different time because of many reasons such as looking for better job , house , community and so on . 	0
PE	8078	Staying in one place is better than moving number of places 	0
PE	8079	If anyone needs help , his neighbor will help as much as possible . 	1
PE	8080	Every people in my town have known each others , and we have good relationships . 	0
PE	8081	In here , I have a lot of friends , and we usually spend free time to play sports like soccer , basketball and of course we have a lot of fun . 	0
PE	8082	I was born and grew up in here , a small town . 	0
PE	8083	I want to live here because I love the traffic system in here . 	1
PE	8084	Nowhere else can give me some people like in here . 	0
PE	8085	Their notion should be inspirational in such a way which makes our society educative and increase our literacy rate . 	0
PE	8086	I believe that they are important somehow , but not essential . 	1
PE	8087	However , while people view these sportive events as vital in release international problems , others think that they are just entertainment to distract people . 	0
PE	8088	Moreover , these sports events are not essential in other issues such as politics or other international affairs . 	1
PE	8089	For example , the football world cup taking place every four years is a very followed event during which everyone is having fun . 	0
PE	8090	In conclusion , although letting languages spoken by ethnic minorities be extinct seems to be very beneficial , it will definitely impact seriously on many other aspects especially in the loss of our cultural heritages . 	1
PE	8091	Therefore , saving the use of that kinds of languages in this case generally is the most important element of the cultural diversity ' s preservation . 	0
PE	8092	On one hand , governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands . 	0
PE	8093	Specifically , price control institution has been used in plenty of social areas , for example , in the farming products and in the real estate area ; however , whether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated . 	0
PE	8094	On the other hand , pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil , chemical pollutants , extra lights , also constitute considerable amount of pollution . 	0
PE	8095	Consequently , it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly . 	1
PE	8096	As we read newspapers or watch TV , we have always been attracted by environmental problems such as traffic issues , air and water pollution questions . 	0
PE	8097	Growing traffic and pollution can be controlled by increasing petrol prices 	0
PE	8098	As the impacts for those pollution and traffic issues are extremely far-reaching , it is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems , though it is a promising method discussed in the contemporary society . 	1
PE	8099	Initiatives should be taken to address the specific problems . 	0
PE	8100	As illustrated before , several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems . 	1
PE	8101	In addition , the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace , resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours . 	0
PE	8102	In short , I can say for certain that spending money on improving public transportation is necessary because it is the key to protect our world , creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in . 	1
PE	8103	It means that by using public transports , the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads , which is always full of fumes . 	0
PE	8104	Last but not least , using public transportation is much safer than private transportation . 	0
PE	8105	According to National Safety Council , riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care . 	0
PE	8106	Thus there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation , a healthy , safe and economical way of transporting . 	1
PE	8107	Alternative forms of transport to alleviate traffic congestion 	0
PE	8108	Recently , a great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation . 	0
PE	8109	Some state that automobile is the most convenient transportation , while others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution . 	0
PE	8110	In my opinion , I strongly agree that alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced . 	1
PE	8111	In this essay , several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages . 	0
PE	8112	Firstly , an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution . 	0
PE	8113	Since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air , the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants . 	0
PE	8114	Therefore , it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles . 	1
PE	8115	Secondly , an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion . 	0
PE	8116	Once we get into the traffic jam , it forces us to waste our time for a while . 	0
PE	8117	If they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins , it is so easy for them . 	0
PE	8118	Criminals should be punished for their misdeeds . 	0
PE	8119	Second , learning abilities in each students is different . 	0
PE	8120	If teachers pay attention to specific students , their work might not finish on time , and this might make many student miss some field in topics that they should know . 	0
PE	8121	Some students might understand all topics that they had learnt but some are not . 	0
PE	8122	It is not possible that they all comprehend all lessons in the same period of time . 	0
PE	8123	This problems depend on how hard study they do . 	0
PE	8124	Therefore , testing result are different . 	0
PE	8125	Still , I an firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my sentiment are much more tenable and cogent . 	0
PE	8126	Thus , teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get . 	1
PE	8127	In other words , students can procure more advantages from better facilities . 	1
PE	8128	Based on the reasons demonstrate above , I believe that improving facilities is the best way for school because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the other . 	1
PE	8129	It is not teachers fault . 	0
PE	8130	No one has the right to take the life of a human ; even if he committed murder . 	0
PE	8131	It is undeniable that the rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being . 	0
PE	8132	For instance , some lecturers in our university read the same text in the reference books for that particular course module . 	0
PE	8133	Further , they didn ' t explain the contents in order to understand by the students . 	0
PE	8134	Therefore , I strongly agree that going to classes should be optional for the students . 	1
PE	8135	To begin with , going to classes are sometimes waste of the time . 	1
PE	8136	Some students believe that they should be required to attend classes while others believe that it is an optional for the students . 	0
PE	8137	According to my opinion , because it is university level of education , students have enough maturity to choose their choice . 	1
PE	8138	Going to classes should be optional for the students 	0
PE	8139	University students have different opinion about their attendance to class . 	0
PE	8140	It was waste of the time . 	0
PE	8141	Because the university students have grown up , they have enough ability to read and understand the text book . 	1
PE	8142	Recent investigations reveal that toxic foods are sold pervasively in today ' s market . 	0
PE	8143	Also , overpopulation may make people suffer from infectious deseases , especially cough , sneezing and illness . 	0
PE	8144	Furthermore , historic buildings make our lives more colorful , provide places for citizens to relax bodies and minds . 	1
PE	8145	Depending on the study of Capital Palace , researchers have a comprehensive understanding of the history and the culture . 	0
PE	8146	Our governments will be happy with those efficient consequences , and a majority of cities also can imitate this economical cycle . 	0
PE	8147	There are many historic buildings , such as Beijing Place , Shanghai Artist Museum , they are all able to support themselves financially by charging tens of thousands of tourists . 	0
PE	8148	Meanwhile , historic buildings can be a source of maintenance fees . 	1
PE	8149	Lying under the roof of a historic building or sitting on the desk fill with history are both easy ways to forget life ' s little annoyance and feel peaceful . 	0
PE	8150	Life in Big Cities Vs People ' s health 	0
PE	8151	Today , more and more people are moving to big cities to live . 	0
PE	8152	However , while life in those cities is good in some ways , I completely argue that people ' s health would therefore be affected negatively . 	1
PE	8153	Environment pollution one of the primary reasons why life in cities is becoming worse than ever before . 	1
PE	8154	Exhaust from transportation , especially cars , and factories ' tosix fumes can lead people to face with various respiratory deseases . 	0
PE	8155	Besides , water pollution makes people ' s health become more critical . 	0
PE	8156	The fact is that dangerous bacterias and germs in polluted water can go indirectly into people ' s bodies and create severe problems , which may result in death if the patients are not treated in time . 	0
PE	8157	Moreover , it is likely that many foods in big cities are not safe for people to eat or drink . 	1
PE	8158	They are essential to our spiritual life . 	0
PE	8159	They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way . 	0
PE	8160	Second , music and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing . 	0
PE	8161	Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies , music and art still bring out children ' s joy of flying in imagination . 	0
PE	8162	If parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer , that might be too much . 	0
PE	8163	In my opinion , it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like . 	0
PE	8164	However , some people might argue that parents shouldn ' t put so much stress on children , since learning too many skills seems to be a burden for them . 	1
PE	8165	Therefore , even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists , learning music and art is still worthy because it can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure . 	1
PE	8166	In this way , it will not be such pressure on children . 	0
PE	8167	In a child stage , music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills . 	0
PE	8168	It is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities . 	0
PE	8169	In addition , the policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam . 	0
PE	8170	Obviously , the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth . 	1
PE	8171	Whereas , if there are more good buses , trains , or subways , people are inclined to use less private vehicles , which decreases the amount of carbon released . 	0
PE	8172	In conclusion , I would concede that high-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around . 	1
PE	8173	There is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion . 	0
PE	8174	In order to tackle the problem , governments have to turn people ' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes . 	1
PE	8175	The main reason for this issue is that there are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads . 	0
PE	8176	They not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere . 	1
PE	8177	Nevertheless , public transportation systems even have more important advantages . 	1
PE	8178	Some people might argue that economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside . 	1
PE	8179	Environmental issues can not be divided by nationality because all humans are simply entwined together by our only home-Earth . 	0
PE	8180	However , the truth is that we ' ve been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now . 	0
PE	8181	They may say that if the economic is in a very bad situation , people would revolt instantly , while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away . 	0
PE	8182	Environmental problems are global rather than local , which means that no countries can be spared from these problems . 	0
PE	8183	Second , the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues . 	1
PE	8184	The melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region , but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator , since the rising sea water could drown them . 	0
PE	8185	Take global warming for example , when the temperature increases , the whole globe is affected , suffering the hotter weather together . 	0
PE	8186	In conclusion , environmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence . 	1
PE	8187	It would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately , usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages . 	0
PE	8188	Furthermore , it also have potentially harm for human ' s health without any testing . 	0
PE	8189	Thus even if they are volunteers ; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines . 	0
PE	8190	To sum up , I reaffirm that although there is some disadvantages of animals ' profits , the merits of animal experiments still outweigh the demerits . 	1
PE	8191	One of the difficulties was some of his histories , such as Mickey Mouse and Three Little Pigs , were turned down . 	0
PE	8192	He heard lots of " no " , furthermore one editor fired him alleging that he had no imagination , after all what he had gone through , he never stop chasing his dreams . 	0
PE	8193	It is possible to get frustrate along the way , but it is vital to never give up on your dream . 	1
PE	8194	To illustrate , Walt Disney , whose career is famous , had a challenging life . 	0
PE	8195	To conclude , in this competitive world you have to be fearless and face all new situations . 	1
PE	8196	Even though sometimes you consider backing down and stay in the same routine that you are used to , it is necessary to have courage to take risks , be different and pursue your dream to have a successful life . 	1
PE	8197	After having considered all the problems that I have discussed above , we can finally draw a conclusion that although mobile phones brings convenience of communication , they also contribute to some social problems . 	1
PE	8198	Therefore , mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication . 	1
PE	8199	However , other people may perceive this issue from different viewpoint . 	0
PE	8200	Therefore , the hardship of communication may be developed . 	1
PE	8201	For instance , as lots of chatting apps available online such as " Weichat " , people tend to send instant messages free of charge by using their phones rather than face to face communication . 	0
PE	8202	With rapid development of the internet , people are able to enjoy quick electronic communication via internet . 	0
PE	8203	Vehicle technology enables many people to drive private cars , and emission of exhaust gas could lead to air pollution in large cities . 	0
PE	8204	In conclusion , although technological progress causes corresponding problems , it still provides us with much more advantages . 	1
PE	8205	People utilize architecture technology to construct buildings to expand urban areas , and fuel companies apply drilling technology to extract a great amount of fossil oil in natural regions . 	0
PE	8206	This would pose a large threat to the ecology and environment . 	0
PE	8207	In conclusion , I agree that IT discoveries are likely to have more disadvantages than benefits and people should know how to use their developments properly . 	1
PE	8208	In conclusion , students can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes . 	1
PE	8209	Besides , even if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors , they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates . 	0
PE	8210	I believe that professors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors . 	0
PE	8211	However , in my opinion , this is a rather immodest way of thinking . 	0
PE	8212	Doesn ' t self-study more efficient ? 	0
PE	8213	Why wasting time going to classes ? 	0
PE	8214	Some people might argue that if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own . 	1
PE	8215	Those who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn ' t show up in the classes . 	0
PE	8216	In other words , class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances . 	1
PE	8217	Many professors grade their students with class attendances . 	0
PE	8218	In the modern world , computers are used everywhere . 	0
PE	8219	Ever since Charles Babbage ( know as " Father of computers " ) invented computers , its development never had a pause . 	0
PE	8220	Computer-a device which has given a whole new dimension to the human life . 	0
PE	8221	But today , it can be sent in few minutes by typing a email and few clicks . 	0
PE	8222	For example , in earlier days , if one had to send a message to someone in other country , it used to take months . 	0
PE	8223	After I watch the soccer match between Korea and Japan , the stress was gone . 	0
PE	8224	So , I was quite aggressive , however . 	0
PE	8225	In addition , Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses . 	1
PE	8226	Using those education programs let people get a lot of inspirations instead of having negative effects . 	0
PE	8227	Also , there are many documentary films such as the life of a great man in Korea . 	0
PE	8228	We can study subjects through EBS lecture . 	0
PE	8229	As an example , I got too much stress from the school . 	0
PE	8230	When they are watching sports programs , it ' s easy to relieve those stresses . 	0
PE	8231	Many children have a lot of stresses recently , since they have so much pressure about study . 	0
PE	8232	There are many Tv programs such as sports programs . 	0
PE	8233	However , I believe their concern is groundless . 	0
PE	8234	Instead , technology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles . 	1
PE	8235	In terms of time and space , technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life . 	1
PE	8236	In the past , only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles . 	0
PE	8237	Technology keeps traditional skills and ways of life alive or not ? 	0
PE	8238	Living in the 21st century , people are firmly convinced that technology is the main driving force behind productivity . 	0
PE	8239	Thus , every country has been promoting technological advances in the recent years , regardless of any potential problems it may bring about . 	0
PE	8240	Some people are worried modern technological technology is probably a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles . 	0
PE	8241	This means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills . 	0
PE	8242	However , with the access to the Internet , one of the greatest innovations in modern society , humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime , anywhere . 	0
PE	8243	Childhood , in several aspects , is the happiest period of our lives . 	1
PE	8244	In adulthood , people are forced to express themselves in boundaries , therefore they are in no way free to think or use their imagination . 	0
PE	8245	In an ideal world with less boundaries , social judgement and more freedom of thought , things could be different ; but since this is not the case , it seems that we will always be missing our childhood days . 	0
PE	8246	It ' s not only because of the nature of childhood and children , but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults . 	1
PE	8247	Therefore , childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most . 	1
PE	8248	There are lots of new facts you can learn , stories you can listen to and things you can see . 	0
PE	8249	Children are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults , and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination . 	0
PE	8250	Using your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child . 	1
PE	8251	Although exploring space used for discovery of other planets , nowadays most of governments have used many rockets for military purposes and therefore the purposes of exploring space has altered . 	0
PE	8252	In summary , spending budget for space exploring is not the waste budget , because it may helps to save civilization of humanity . 	1
PE	8253	As a result , space exploration will use as a military power for many countries . 	1
PE	8254	Both countries tried to send man to the moon and show their power to each other . 	0
PE	8255	In the past , the space race happened between the United Stated and the Soviet Union . 	0
PE	8256	It not only has the advantage of working with colleges but also it provides a real working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home . 	1
PE	8257	Moreover , people who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office , like some announcements from the boss . 	0
PE	8258	In conclusion , working in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency . 	1
PE	8259	It ' s hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away . 	0
PE	8260	In addition , while people are working at home , there will be no one supervising them , thus raises the chance of loafing . 	0
PE	8261	Second , working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works . 	1
PE	8262	For example , people are easily distracted while working at home . 	0
PE	8263	Thus , I firmly believe that both genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers . 	1
PE	8264	People benefit more from coming computers into their lives . 	1
PE	8265	It ' s more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone . 	0
PE	8266	For another example , if one ’ s computer or Internet has any breakdown , he / she can call the MIS staff to fix . 	0
PE	8267	In my opinion , I believe that working at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office . 	1
PE	8268	First of all , while working in the office , people can interact with their colleges instantly . 	1
PE	8269	They can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together . 	0
PE	8270	Think about the big project that a group is working on , if any group member has new idea about the project , he / she can assemble his / her colleges right away and discuss . 	0
PE	8271	Working at home vs Working in a company 	0
PE	8272	Due to the convenience of current technology , people can do their works everywhere as long as they have the equipment around them . 	0
PE	8273	People are no longer restricted in the office . 	0
PE	8274	This rapid progress in technology leads to the question whether it ' s better working at home with a computer and a phone than working at the company ' s office . 	0
PE	8275	Some people might say I am silly , but I think mistake is more forgettable than friendship . 	1
PE	8276	However , I forgot about it just after two days , and I felt at peace with him . 	0
PE	8277	However , if you end a friendship whenever your friend makes a mistake , there will be no friends around you . 	0
PE	8278	Second , Everybody makes mistake . 	1
PE	8279	However , when the mistake friend made was not a big problem , we need to understand friend and forgive it because a friend is a gift of our life . 	0
PE	8280	I agree if a friend makes very a big mistake , we will need to end a friendship . 	0
PE	8281	I think that a mistake can not brake friendship if it is not a big because friendship is forever and gift our life . 	1
PE	8282	According to a research , 85% of people answered that a best gift is a friend . 	0
PE	8283	In conclusion , the above stated reasons clearly outweigh the fact that cars cause a lot of pollution because they provide flexibility , which is important in nearly all areas of life . 	1
PE	8284	Personally , I agree with this statement . 	0
PE	8285	First , the core of group working is " consensus " . 	1
PE	8286	It ' s the idea that everyone ’ s opinion accounts . 	0
PE	8287	In group works , group members gather together to have brain-storming discussion , think over every possible solutions and then finally reach an agreement . 	0
PE	8288	People who can ’ t accept others ’ criticism can ’ t succeed in group working 	0
PE	8289	In everyday life we encounter different people , and we receive different opinions about us or our works , no matter positive or negative . 	0
PE	8290	It might be easy to take praises but hard to accept criticism . 	0
PE	8291	Therefore , here goes the point that people who can ' t accept others ' criticism can ' t succeed in group working . 	1
PE	8292	In this long process of discussion , there must be different opinions sparkling out . 	0
PE	8293	It doesn ' t work if one member solely insists on his / her idea and doesn ' t take other member ' s criticism because the work belongs to every member , not a personal show for specific one member . 	0
PE	8294	The reason for this is traditional education has its stand for most appropriate method . 	1
PE	8295	Although , it is agreed that learning by watching TV is more effective to some children , I find it difficult not to oppose against the idea of having students spend more time on TVs . 	0
PE	8296	Education is undeniably pivotal for an individual . 	0
PE	8297	How to learn children more efficiently 	0
PE	8298	The purpose of education is always a controversial topic among people and society , especially in high level such as college or university . 	0
PE	8299	Technology and its advance , to some degrees , have influenced the educational industry positively . 	0
PE	8300	To begin with , classic teaching methods has been scientifically proven and utilized as the best mode of educate a child . 	0
PE	8301	Thus , physical inactivity should not be encouraged for the aim of bettering youngsters ' skills . 	1
PE	8302	Yet , monitors are unable to replace the appearance of educators since their knowledge and adaptability is priceless . 	0
PE	8303	The fact that students nowadays do their homework or researches on computers rather than go to libraries is an illustration for this . 	0
PE	8304	Some people argue that this may lead to ' social division ' , when someone with high education refuses to do the called ' low jobs ' , but actually it gives no harm to the whole community . 	0
PE	8305	Secondly , university should only accept good students because it gives better human resources for sophisticated purposes . 	1
PE	8306	I am a kind of person who believes to children should learn to manage their own money at a young age , due to reasons that I stated below . 	1
PE	8307	From my perspective , the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways because of three crucial reasons . 	1
PE	8308	Many countries have suffered from pollution , noisy and casualty for a long time . 	0
PE	8309	The population explosion results in the high demands of transportation . 	0
PE	8310	Government should regard investing in building roads as the most important 	0
PE	8311	Most importantly , there are many accidents happening on the roads . 	0
PE	8312	Moreover , the sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing . 	0
PE	8313	The buses , cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia . 	0
PE	8314	First and foremost , we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents . 	1
PE	8315	Each year , Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan . 	0
PE	8316	For example , in my country , buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents . 	0
PE	8317	To sum up , I believe that a higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder-working employees . 	1
PE	8318	Alternatively , providing a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity since they will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses . 	1
PE	8319	It ’ s certainly better for children to grow up in a big city . 	1
PE	8320	Modern cooking methods have improved our life-style significantly 	0
PE	8321	With technology advances , food has become easier to prepare in modern days . 	0
PE	8322	People now can use kitchen appliances such as microwave and toaster to cook their meals easier and more convenient than before . 	0
PE	8323	Also , instant food products take only a few minutes to be made into delicious meals . 	0
PE	8324	These changes make cooking so easy-to-use and time-saving as to improve the way we live to a great extent . 	1
PE	8325	First of all , people have more chance to do other activities they like since food preparation is no longer time-consuming . 	1
PE	8326	For instance , such a change has liberated many housewives from tedious cooking process and gave them additional time to do something more meaningful like accompanying family or doing a job . 	0
PE	8327	On the other hand , more people can sleep a bit later to go to work because they only need a couple of time to prepare for the breakfasts . 	0
PE	8328	At the second point , since food preparation has become easier and more convenient , it is certainly great to preserve diverse kinds of foods at home . 	1
PE	8329	People can have a variety of dishes even in a small meal and choose whatever they like . 	0
PE	8330	In conclusion , International sporting events will draw the international concern . 	1
PE	8331	Everythings is created by patriotic emotions of Chinese who wanted to bring a beautiful China to the world . 	0
PE	8332	It will make the world more peaceful by easing internation tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way . 	1
PE	8333	For this point , they all think that the very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure . 	0
PE	8334	Another function that all zoos serve relates to education . 	0
PE	8335	Some people spot out that humanities benefit so much from zoos . 	1
PE	8336	First of all , zoos are fascinating places of entertainment . 	0
PE	8337	Zoos have been established for ages all over the world and have become interesting places for entertainment . 	0
PE	8338	Over the time , there are also a lot of arguments concerning whether zoos are helpful in serving people or they are just some kinds of bad treatments to animals . 	0
PE	8339	Do zoos serve any useful function ? 	0
PE	8340	It has become quite a common hobby of children that they usually spend their free time in zoos . 	0
PE	8341	They are responsible to take care of everything including paying their apartment rent on time , and dealing with the utility bills . 	0
PE	8342	In addition , students also have to focus on their study , and try to maintain their grades higher . 	0
PE	8343	Furthermore , students also have a chance to know about the community around them . 	0
PE	8344	Interacting with the people , and socializing with them prepares students for the life after graduation . 	0
PE	8345	From given the evidences , it seems to me that it becomes hard for students to choose between their living options since both living accommodation have its own benefits . 	1
PE	8346	If I have to choose , I would definitely choose the second option : living in an apartment . 	1
PE	8347	I think that it teaches me everything that I certainly wants to learn in my life because learning all those characteristics would really help me in leading successful life . 	1
PE	8348	Moreover , some zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct . 	0
PE	8349	Test-wise candidates can often perform well on exams without having good underlying knowledge or skills . 	0
PE	8350	In contrast , some test-takers perform cannot achieve a satisfying result because of anxiety . 	0
PE	8351	" Pen and Paper " Examination 	0
PE	8352	Examinations are one of the most common methods of measuring learning in education systems throughout the world . 	0
PE	8353	At virtually every stage of the learning process , exams are used to verify that the learner is ready to move on to the next stage . 	0
PE	8354	However , many believe that the role of examinations should be reconsidered . 	0
PE	8355	There are clearly advantages to exams . 	1
PE	8356	They help to ensure fairness by imposing the same conditions on all exam candidates . 	0
PE	8357	They are also relatively versatile ; different types of exam questions , for example , multiple-choice questions and essay tasks , can test different sorts of reasoning ability . 	0
PE	8358	However , exams also have some drawbacks . 	1
PE	8359	The reasons to be illustrated are follows . 	0
PE	8360	However , from my perspective , students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing exam . 	1
PE	8361	For example , I love Physics . 	0
PE	8362	Firstly , the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject . 	1
PE	8363	Though out the last decade , the load of the university students has been constantly increasing . 	0
PE	8364	It is not necessary for university students to attend classes 	0
PE	8365	There are those who said that student can attend the university coarse without passing the exam . 	0
PE	8366	There are those who consider that university students cannot attend any classes until the students pass the exam . 	0
PE	8367	And I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics . 	0
PE	8368	But I don ' t like electronics , because electronics cannot always be seen in the real world . 	0
PE	8369	Things have changed a lot . 	0
PE	8370	I grow up in a better condition than my father did . 	0
PE	8371	In the past , seldom people have the chance to attend a collage . 	0
PE	8372	For example , my grandparents did not get a education even in high school , so when my father had difficulty in solving a problem in his childhood , he had to go to his teacher for help . 	0
PE	8373	What is more , family members can help us in many other aspects . 	1
PE	8374	For example , when I did not know what major to choose when I attend university , my father told a lot about different majors . 	0
PE	8375	Whenever I have problems , I can always ask my parents for help . 	0
PE	8376	They can solve the problem quickly because they have learned quite a lot . 	0
PE	8377	What is more , the factory is not isolated , other industries and business will be quickly established , resulting in economic growth of local area . 	0
PE	8378	To manufacture goods , there must be the demand of laborers , from which the local residents can benefit . 	0
PE	8379	He shared his own experience with me , which helped me quite a lot . 	0
PE	8380	Parents are quite experienced than their child , they can guide them toward the right direction . 	0
PE	8381	However a vast number of people are against building a factory near their community because of pollution . 	0
PE	8382	Out of the case of economic development , industrial buildings are a necessary part of modern society . 	0
PE	8383	Nowadays , whether to establish large factories nearby housing areas has become a controversial issue in our society . 	0
PE	8384	Influence of large factories 	0
PE	8385	Through part-time job , she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life . 	0
PE	8386	My friend Lisa , who is doing part-time job now , tells me that it is fabulous to take it . 	0
PE	8387	Because most people they contact with are also students . 	0
PE	8388	First , there are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university . 	0
PE	8389	So , they can teach students many things about adult life . 	1
PE	8390	However , when students do part-time jobs , they can work with many kinds of people , and most of whom are adults . 	0
PE	8391	Nowadays , the difference between school and society is bigger and bigger . 	0
PE	8392	The part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it 	0
PE	8393	There are some reasons can support my view . 	0
PE	8394	If students want to get used to the society quickly , it is better for parents to encourage them to take part-time jobs . 	1
PE	8395	To conclude , I would say that people should create a sense of co-operation in their children to make them feel more accomplished in life . 	1
PE	8396	Consequently , the calm atmosphere in the class might be created . 	0
PE	8397	In fact , students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music . 	0
PE	8398	Moreover , if musical activity involves many participants , there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group , which is , of course , beneficial in their future life . 	0
PE	8399	In this case , music can be a useful and interesting solution . 	0
PE	8400	I have an impression that students , who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time . 	0
PE	8401	Therefore , many university authorities provide music lessons for their students so that they live and study in a harmony with music . 	1
PE	8402	It is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology . 	0
PE	8403	In this essay I will give my opinion for both sides . 	0
PE	8404	Most people claim that in high school music must be taught as a main subject , while others say that this is an unnecessary subject and should at least be optional . 	0
PE	8405	Should high school make music lessons compulsory 	0
PE	8406	I can prepare my schedules , guidelines , exercises and go over them all . 	0
PE	8407	For instance , I am a type of person who cannot comprehend my subjects unless I am alone . 	0
PE	8408	Studying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons . 	1
PE	8409	Yet , I prefer to study individually because it helps me to concentrate more , and it helps me to build my personality . 	1
PE	8410	Some students benefit a lot when they study with groups . 	0
PE	8411	At school or university , success depends on how we study . 	0
PE	8412	Everyone has their method to success in life . 	0
PE	8413	Some students prefer to study alone 	0
PE	8414	In my opinion , I can take advantage of every minute without wasting by studying alone . 	0
PE	8415	Moreover , we have a lot of subjects which require us to sit and study alone such as math , reading , and drawing . 	0
PE	8416	Although some people argue that children should be free to spend money to they what they want , In my opinion it is very important to learn our children from their beginning of their life to be financially responsible persons , because our personality form in childhood and it is not easy to change it in adulthood . 	1
PE	8417	Many old traditionally cultural things have long gone as a result of modern technology . 	1
PE	8418	For instance , factories equipped with new and highly-productive system has replaced old handmade products , the exchange of letters among friends is so hard to be seen as we have had emails and social network instead , new video games has superseded the old-physical ones . 	0
PE	8419	However , these newfangled practices has replaced many old traditional ones . 	0
PE	8420	The invention of mobile phone and internet has changed our traditional ways of communicating as well as working , it has also been much less labourous than in the pass with the assistance of electrical machineries . 	0
PE	8421	Thanks to modern technology , our life has been improved with many gadgets . 	1
PE	8422	While there is belief that technology advances means a lost in traditional cultures , I would argue that although the affect of technology on culture is undeniable , it has also contributed to the preservation of traditonal culture . 	1
PE	8423	Nowadays , technology has been developing significantly , impacting many aspects of our life . 	0
PE	8424	Modern technology has impacted the traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways 	0
PE	8425	Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete . 	0
PE	8426	The athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country . 	0
PE	8427	Internet has aided to assess the young generations to the cultural identity of many nations from all around the world . 	0
PE	8428	However , despite the drawback mentioned above , technology has also made some contributions to the maintenance and study of traditional cultures in some ways . 	1
PE	8429	A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself . 	0
PE	8430	We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success . 	0
PE	8431	Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children . 	0
PE	8432	Co-operation is essential for teamwork . 	1
PE	8433	However , co-operative approach always helps a child to become a responsible adult with good moral values and a friendly social circle . 	0
PE	8434	Some people think that inculcating co-operative approach in a child is essential while some think that competing is the best way to succeed . 	0
PE	8435	The modern society is full of cut-throat competition . 	0
PE	8436	Competition or co-operation-which is better 	0
PE	8437	It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy . 	0
PE	8438	For instance , lions hunt in a team . 	0
PE	8439	Besides , when we practice outdoors and indoors sports , many aspects are getting clearer . 	1
PE	8440	For example , when a person goes jogging everyday , eventually he can understand his own body through direct observation . 	0
PE	8441	Physical exercises help to create healthy nation , assist to learning through direct observation and finally aid to financial development of a country . 	1
PE	8442	First of all , the ancient Latin proverb says : " Anima sana in corpore sano " , which means that healthy body is basis for healthy soul . 	0
PE	8443	Physical exercise 	0
PE	8444	Although some people think that the major part of school schedule should be entirely devoted to academics , I truly believe that the physical education part should not be outweighed . 	1
PE	8445	Additionally , there is a fact that one can improve health conditions with everyday physical activity : gradually , step by step we change physical condition to better . 	0
PE	8446	So , if the entire nation , from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday , eventually it may help to build healthy nation . 	1
PE	8447	There is a direct linkage between people ' s health and the frequency of doing physical exercises . 	0
PE	8448	The more we practice , the better we feel . 	0
PE	8449	It helps people build a sustainable society where people can live a happy life when they are old . 	1
PE	8450	By way of conclusion , it is true that the development of the health care system helps people have a better life . 	1
PE	8451	They have given their effort to the society so that young people , the governments have a responsibility to improve the Medicare system . 	0
PE	8452	Although it is real in some aspects , I believe that the capital that spend on taking care the elderly is contributed by these people during their working time , so they are worth to have good care . 	0
PE	8453	With newly developing technologies , people are able to carry various tasks more convenient and easy . 	0
PE	8454	This means that girls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent , and they both have better ability in the specific aspect . 	0
PE	8455	Furthermore , it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender , and that does not conform to students ' personality traits and mental development . 	1
PE	8456	Most of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act , and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases . 	0
PE	8457	For instance , there are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world . 	0
PE	8458	Many boys are interested in science and technology , while a number of girls like to learn literature , education and arts . 	0
PE	8459	Besides , girls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication , such as teacher , singer and interpreter . 	0
PE	8460	We can not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject 	0
PE	8461	There is a view that universities and colleges should equally enroll male and female students in numbers in each faculty . 	0
PE	8462	Personally , I do not agree the viewpoint , because many different characters exist between male and female students . 	1
PE	8463	On one hand , boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality . 	1
PE	8464	Nonetheless , innovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience . 	1
PE	8465	It helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments . 	0
PE	8466	Hence , creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions . 	1
PE	8467	Time and again , creative artists like Michaelangelo , Picasso , Salman Rushdie , Shakespeare etc . have made artistic works which gave a social message . 	0
PE	8468	Right from sculptures to paintings , books to drama and movies , all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras . 	0
PE	8469	Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message . 	1
PE	8470	Creativity - should it be given freedom or restrictions 	0
PE	8471	Creativity is the ability to think beyond the obvious . 	0
PE	8472	Many governments restrict the artistic works of the creative minds . 	0
PE	8473	Creativity originates in a free mind . 	1
PE	8474	Many people think they are blessed to be in the era of high technology . 	0
PE	8475	We definitely do not want our children to spend money on luxurious custom or lifestyle just to be similar to someone , especially when these people are not symbols of any talent but showing off . 	0
PE	8476	However , the young generation these days is very conscious toward positive lifestyles . 	0
PE	8477	They are mostly being educated at very early ages by family or schools as to distinguish what is benefit for them . 	0
PE	8478	Therefore , it is not easy to influence young people these days when they are well equipped of life skills . 	1

PE	8480	Some people argue that adolescents are being influenced badly by untalented people who become famous thanks to their luxurious lifestyle and wealth . 	0
PE	8481	To some extent , I do not agree with this statement . 	0
PE	8482	First of all , it is true that people use their money to become an inspiration are definitely not a good mirror for young people . 	1
PE	8483	Moreover , it seems to me that not many people can exist in the celebrities ' world without any talents or achievements . 	0
PE	8484	We are giving chances to many teenagers to show their intelligence in different talent shows , for example ; The Voice , X Factor or Next Top Models etc . As a result , to become a star and an inspiration for people , a person need to have real talent to compete with other candidates . 	0
PE	8485	When we talk about student , we generally mean a boy or a girl who study in school or college . 	0
PE	8486	Part time job for teenage students 	0
PE	8487	However , some people do not support the concept of teenagers doing job beside study . 	0
PE	8488	In some country , teenage students have the opportunity to do some part time job beside their study . 	0
PE	8489	The main reason is that students can learn lots of things from part time job , before starting their real job . 	1
PE	8490	In my view , it is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he / she is still a student and this is for two reasons . 	1
PE	8491	For example , when I was in my high school I worked as a sales-man in a shop for a year . 	0
PE	8492	Students can learn about time management , money management and convince people by their words . 	0
PE	8493	I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework . 	0
PE	8494	As i had to spend some of my time in my job , therefore , i had to manage my time efficiently . 	0
PE	8495	Of course , new technologies are always great . 	1
PE	8496	Who would the employer choose , an old man with old-fashioned education and a young man who is not only good at fundermentaly subject , but also knows how to program or how to speak foreign languages . 	0
PE	8497	Last but not least , knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor to help young workers outrank the elderly . 	1
PE	8498	They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also . 	0
PE	8499	For example , nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky . 	0
PE	8500	However , in my point of view , it is still of great importance to remain the harmonious coexistence of both sides for the smooth sailing of the company . 	1
PE	8501	All in a nutshell , workers over 50 have proven themselves subordinate to the following generation in all aspects . 	1
PE	8502	Not to undermine old workers , but their lack of authority over such basically required fields in this day and age leads to their incompetence in every modern workplace . 	0
PE	8503	This factor is still affecting thinking of many people . 	0
PE	8504	Contrastingly , in the past time , women worked at home and performed sophisticated work . 	0
PE	8505	Nowadays men and women are equally participating in every field . 	0
PE	8506	Gender Equality at university admission 	0
PE	8507	Initially , if we look into the fact , women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor . 	0
PE	8508	Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders . 	1
PE	8509	This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender . 	0
PE	8510	They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only . 	0
PE	8511	There are couple reasons and examples to support my answer . 	0
PE	8512	In doing so crime can be eliminated from a nation and it is a responsibility of every individual to be in the favor of truth and respect the laws of our constitution . 	0
PE	8513	To conclude , Government should decide for punishment case by case basis . 	1
PE	8514	Not only because there is no machine for the work , but also it looks more beautiful when it is made by hand , so resulting in greater value economy . 	0
PE	8515	For instance , making cone hats from leaves have to use hand . 	0
PE	8516	Traditional skills and ways of life will help youngsters study and know more history . 	1
PE	8517	The last thing is about education . 	0
PE	8518	Lot of people like to use traditional things because if their quality and durability . 	0
PE	8519	In addition , in some cases that traditional way can not replace by a new technology . 	1
PE	8520	Futhermore , there are plenty of works that using traditional way is unique method . 	0
PE	8521	In paticular , vases are made by hand would be used more . 	0
PE	8522	After that , they might create somethings that are useful for life . 	0
PE	8523	Methods which their ancestors used in the past will be displayed again for new generations . 	0
PE	8524	Indeed , their contribution is less important than those from doctors or scientists , albeit necessary . 	0
PE	8525	Hence , their privilege of salary seems groundless , while the main work forces receive modest salaries which only enable them to afford bare necessities . 	1
PE	8526	From all analysis suggested above , professional athletes and singers are overpaid in terms of their contributions . 	1
PE	8527	I think that there should be a modification in the salary of professional singers and athletes to balance with those of people in other fields , namely science and society , who are the driving forces for the prosperity of the nation . 	0
PE	8528	Other people say that singers and athletes , in fact , contribute insignificantly to the development of the society . 	0
PE	8529	It is assumed the amazing performances they give to the audiences are only valuable in aesthetic and entertaining terms . 	0
PE	8530	While scientists invent machines serving daily lives , doctors take care of patients and cure their diseases and policemen help to ensure the safety and stability of the nation , singers and athletes do not play a helpful part in improving the material life . 	0
PE	8531	They commit themselves to promoting relaxation and enjoyment for the audience . 	0
PE	8532	On special dates , city offers free exhibitions which are available for everyone who is interested in art . 	0
PE	8533	I am keen on museums and it would be a pleasure for me to spend several hours a week in front of famous paintings , sculptures or artifacts . 	0
PE	8534	This can at least assure me that if I feel bad , city can provide a high quality help . 	0
PE	8535	What ' s more , cities have better medical facilities than in the countryside . 	1
PE	8536	A night club is an interesting place to visit for young people . 	0
PE	8537	I am fond of Italian food , and if there is an Italian restaurant in the city , I will definitely visit it . 	0
PE	8538	Cultural life of a metropolis is always an entertaining one . 	1
PE	8539	There a person can listen to music , make new friends or enjoy a a drink alone . 	0
PE	8540	All in all , the best way to judge about individuals ' is to be familiar with their personality not with their appearance . 	1
PE	8541	She asked me to stay with her till my parents come , also she was great in hospitality and her behavior was unforgettable . 	0
PE	8542	One day in a cold winter while I was getting back to home from school I realized that I lost my keys , so I could not do anything before my parents getting back home . 	0
PE	8543	Considering all the benefits , I would choose to live in a big city . 	1
PE	8544	In conclusion , while small towns have picturesque nature and pure air , big cities offer countless amount of opportunities and entertainment places . 	1
PE	8545	The result shows that the 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget , while it takes 30 hours for the later one . 	0
PE	8546	The similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other . 	0
PE	8547	An experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity . 	0
PE	8548	The first group was asked to discuss in person , while the second group was asked to discuss by email . 	0
PE	8549	Firstly , team members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently . 	0
PE	8550	Obviously , discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails . 	1
PE	8551	Do you think classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by e-mail 	0
PE	8552	When it comes to the question whether classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by email , I am of the view that wok in person is preferred because this means help to achieve a good communication . 	1
PE	8553	They are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way . 	0
PE	8554	The company will benefit from every worker of excellent knowledge . 	1
PE	8555	The core and most profitable technology of an IT company is invented by a worker with excellent computer knowledge , not a worker with outstanding communicating skill . 	0
PE	8556	Secondly , work in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project because there will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members . 	0
PE	8557	Writing an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official , therefore people who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing . 	0
PE	8558	In a word , the parents can save money , if their children live with them longer . 	1
PE	8559	Beneficial changes will certainly take place if changes are made because for a change to happen , changes have to be done . 	0
PE	8560	This is of paramount importance so that they will be able to give a better and reliable as well as a fair judgment to the convicted . 	1
PE	8561	The third convincing reason is that the young adult needs father and mother ' s suggestions . 	0
PE	8562	If finally he is proven innocent , he may feel embarrassed to face the public . 	0
PE	8563	It is undeniable that when the background of the convicted is ' dug ' deeper and is revealed to mass of anonymous people , his privacy is being jeopardized . 	1
PE	8564	To conclude , I definitely feel that the current way of the juries judging the case should be transformed and they should know the facts about the criminals they are dealing with . 	1
PE	8565	However , I am sure that the crimes done by criminals should be brought to light and the public should be aware of it so that they will not become a victim as well . 	0
PE	8566	Thus , exposing them to the past records of the criminal can give them more room to think rationally and finally put the pieces together in order to produce a more meaningful decision . 	0
PE	8567	As all of us know , juries are a group of people who have no or less knowledge regarding law . 	0
PE	8568	Not only that , the convicted will also receive a fair action . 	1
PE	8569	By doing so , the juries will have a sense of relief that they have come up with better conclusion based on plenty of evidences . 	0
PE	8570	Spending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be . 	0
PE	8571	Learning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home . 	0
PE	8572	Therefore , he may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents . 	0
PE	8573	Thus , I think undergoing with parents is worthwhile . 	1
PE	8574	Furthermore , living at home costs less than living outside . 	0
PE	8575	However , reasonable attentions should be paid to treatment so that our citizens are always looked after with best services . 	1
PE	8576	In conclusion , I strongly agree that we should give more priority to health education and preventative measures than to treatment . 	1
PE	8577	In addition , because the cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention , the government can save a lot of money for our country ' s health budget . 	0
PE	8578	As human resources play a key role in the development of a country , investing money to enhance the general health state is a totally right decision . 	1
PE	8579	When huge injection campaigns are organized throughout our country , the community ' s health state will be improved remarkably . 	0
PE	8580	For example , vaccines will guarantee that pregnant women and their babies are protected from serious infectious diseases such as flu , smallpox , rubella so on . 	0
PE	8581	Preventative measures will help improve general health state of all citizens . 	0
PE	8582	Therefore it is recommended that young people should be educated not to follow these celebrities blindly , rather they should focus on their career so that they may hope for a bright future . 	0
PE	8583	This has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual . 	1
PE	8584	Thus to conclude , it can be said that when young people follow celebrities , it affects their health as well as behavior in a negative way . 	1
PE	8585	So , this example makes it obvious that these glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people . 	1
PE	8586	For instance recently in a poll conducted by an American magazine it was found that most of the parents and teachers complain that teenagers use derogatory words and abusive language at home and at schools . 	0
PE	8587	Adolescents follow not only the make up and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior . 	0
PE	8588	First of all , many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones . 	1
PE	8589	Despite all these positive aspects , I think that the popularity of mobile phones to the young generation is a bad development . 	1
PE	8590	Nowadays , many young people consider mobile phone as the most important thing in their lives as it keeps them constantly organized and it provides much convenience for them to reach out their families and friends . 	0
PE	8591	Popularity of mobile phones to young people 	0
PE	8592	I have spent most of my time trying to reach a higher level to show-off to my friends . 	0
PE	8593	In my college days , I was once addicted to a certain game on my cellular phone . 	0
PE	8594	Similarly , internet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works . 	0
PE	8595	Games and applications installed in phones have occupied much of their time , leaving them lesser time for their studies and other school activities . 	0
PE	8596	Secondly , juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic . 	1
PE	8597	That goal has led me to my lost in interest on doing my homework and I ended up failing one subject in that semester . 	0
PE	8598	However , a movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters . 	0
PE	8599	If they do not try their best , their protection can be halted and waste of money . 	0
PE	8600	In addition , the preservations need a long time to gather , restore all information as well as train in the educational centre . 	0
PE	8601	All people should give a hand to do this better and governments play a vital role on encouraging and distributing those . 	0
PE	8602	In a nutshell , I am convinced that all languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible . 	1
PE	8603	Although governments invest money on doing that , it is hard to gain the good results . 	0
PE	8604	On the other hand , there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages . 	1
PE	8605	These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular . 	0
PE	8606	As evidence of this , there are a few people , particularly the youngsters , do not pay attention on collecting and studying those . 	0
PE	8607	Roles of international sports events 	0
PE	8608	To sum up , if all those factors are contemplated , it is obviously found that there are many solid reasons to support my viewpoint . 	0
PE	8609	Whenever an international sporting occasion like the football World Cup takes place , it attracts millions of people all over the world . 	0
PE	8610	So , from what have been discussed above , I strongly affirm the conclusion that people will spend less time in cooking food . 	1
PE	8611	When you have just few close friends , on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more , but on the other hand they often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours , adding less to your experience . 	1
PE	8612	In sum , although each choice - few close friends or a large number of friends - presents its advantages and its weak points , I think that spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one ' s life . 	1
PE	8613	Growing violence in films has affected youngsters in a negative way ? 	0
PE	8614	It ' s obvious that violent behavior is growing more in films in recent 20 years . 	0
PE	8615	This matter has been considered as a way to advertise a film . 	0
PE	8616	From my point of view , I believe that violence in movies has negative effects on youngsters mostly on their behaviors , emotions & study . 	1
PE	8617	In the first place , children behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best . 	0
PE	8618	Nowadays children are more involved in TV programs . 	0
PE	8619	Imagine an actor who is a child ’ s favorite is doing violent roles . 	0
PE	8620	Therefore , female students are indicated having the same potential and capability as men . 	1
PE	8621	Automatically , the issue stimulates the stakeholders from many places to think what kind of preparations they should take for stabilising the economic growth and the quality life of people . 	1
PE	8622	Meanwhile , human beings are very sensitive , especially of youngsters . 	0
PE	8623	I strongly agree about this statement . 	0
PE	8624	The proportion of women is rising year by year in many parts of the world recently . 	0
PE	8625	Implementing the statue and right of equal education are believed as a sustainable policy that should be held . 	0
PE	8626	Nowadays , there are many institutions that accept the same average number of male and female students in many kinds of course . 	1
PE	8627	The gender issue for getting education needs 	0
PE	8628	The gender issues have been already discussing for many years in order to give solutions for realising the equal proportion of developing human resources . 	0
PE	8629	As sport has become a common passion which passed over every national border , popular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely . 	1
PE	8630	I might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time so for me it is better to leave a voice mail . 	0
PE	8631	I get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems . 	0
PE	8632	Firstly , communicating by e-mail is easy . 	1
PE	8633	There are several reasons to support this idea which I would like to mention in this essay . 	0
PE	8634	Although many people prefer communicating by telephone or face-to-face , personally I believe that communicating by e-mails or voice mails is better . 	1
PE	8635	Communicating via e-mail and voice mail vs Telephone and face-to face 	0
PE	8636	As for me , I work and study at the university and I don ' t have spare time during the day . 	0
PE	8637	Secondly , you can write an e-mail at any time of the day . 	1
PE	8638	In this case it is not so difficult to write an e-mail or to leave a voice mail because even shy people feel themselves more confident . 	0
PE	8639	Many people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with . 	0
PE	8640	Unlike the distance learning that children have few opportunities to discuss with their friends . 	0
PE	8641	Second , classroom learning provides other activities than studying . 	1
PE	8642	Working in group leads to more discussion and more opinion among the class . 	0
PE	8643	Consequently , the discussion class results in expanded children vision and their respect to others roommate ' s ideas . 	0
PE	8644	Although , online classes have many advantages , for me , I prefer traditional learning classes for several reasons . 	1
PE	8645	First , the participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying . 	1
PE	8646	Almost every school develops their online class systems . 	0
PE	8647	One question I always thought about is whether online computer classes should replace classroom learning . 	0
PE	8648	Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom 	0
PE	8649	During these digital age , the online classes has become more interest and more common in the society . 	0
PE	8650	This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming . 	1
PE	8651	Further , government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy . 	0
PE	8652	In the same way , the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution . 	0
PE	8653	To conclude , it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy . 	1
PE	8654	Secondly , the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming . 	1
PE	8655	For example , the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming . 	0
PE	8656	After all , the harmonious society calls for the joint efforts of the government and citizens . 	0
PE	8657	At the same time , citizens available for the both should encourage the government to allocate money to more urgent areas . 	0
PE	8658	Personally , I think the government should fund the deprived for their health care and education , who are the group in real need for the authority ' s help . 	1
PE	8659	Instead , the government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members ' wellbeing , such as soaring crime rate , AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure , which are requiring financial resources from the government to address . 	0
PE	8660	In modern life , zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers . 	1
PE	8661	Besides , recently , zookeepers have also tried their best to make animals feel more comfortable by making artificial landscapes more familiar to the nature , taking care all animals in both feeding and sanity . 	1
PE	8662	On the other hand , there are , however , people who think that zoos just take away freedom of animals . 	1
PE	8663	Being confined , animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented . 	0
PE	8664	In their opinion , zoos are some kind of prisons and it ' s so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons . 	0
PE	8665	From my point of view , I agree with the first group . 	0
PE	8666	Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting . 	1
PE	8667	In this case , the employees know that their company is investing on them for future development of their company . 	0
PE	8668	Secondly , employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained . 	1
PE	8669	Clearly , in company we always have to deal with so many stressful situations such as negotiating with difficult customer , complaining from boss , etc . Therefore , we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends , joking in class , enjoying new knowledge . 	1
PE	8670	Firstly , training time can provide employee interesting time outside working office to refresh their mind . 	0
PE	8671	My arguments for this point are listed follows . 	0
PE	8672	Besides the methods , from my point of view , providing professional training can be effective in encouraging further good work . 	1
PE	8673	It is unquestionable that salary increases and promotions to new positions are very common way to reward employees for good work . 	0
PE	8674	Salary increases and promotions to new positions are not the only ways 	0
PE	8675	For another thing , employees will be very proud of themselves when they are provided training while others don ' t have this opportunity . 	0
PE	8676	So obviously , they will think about develop long term career with their company . 	0
PE	8677	On the one hand , I have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area . 	1
PE	8678	To make it convenient , I will absolutely choose a place to live that is not too far from my workplace . 	0
PE	8679	What ' s more I can save plenty of money on transportation if I choose to live in the city . 	0
PE	8680	On the other hand , life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town . 	1
PE	8681	A more convenient life in a city 	0
PE	8682	There are undeniable advantages to both life in a big city and in a small town . 	0
PE	8683	The former offers more excitement and convenience while the latter offers a cleaner , quieter and often friendlier place to live . 	0
PE	8684	However , despite the advantages of small town life , I prefer to live in a big city for several reasons . 	1
PE	8685	You can enjoy modern life and have more access to the advanced facilities . 	0
PE	8686	For instance , you can visit museums to learn history , and go to a more equipped library to enjoy reading , or you can go to a sports center for exercising . 	0
PE	8687	It is every student ' s desire to study at a good university and experience a new environment . 	0
PE	8688	Living and studying overseas 	0
PE	8689	There will have many disadvantages if the workers work at home . 	1
PE	8690	Interaction is a factor increasing working quality . 	0
PE	8691	Compared to the peers studying in the home country , it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself / herself into new environments and situations in life . 	0
PE	8692	First , studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures . 	1
PE	8693	One who is living overseas will of course struggle with loneliness , living away from family and friends but those difficulties will turn into valuable experiences in the following steps of life . 	0
PE	8694	Second , living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet . 	1
PE	8695	Also , employers are mostly looking for people who have international and language skills . 	0
PE	8696	Moreover , the one will learn living without depending on anyone else . 	0
PE	8697	The dos and don ' t at office play important role to prevent these things from workers . 	0
PE	8698	Facebook or Yahoo have been the entertaining websites , however , they are the reasons why people cannot concentrate on their job . 	0
PE	8699	Besides , interaction help employees improve their communicational skills , therefore , they will have more and more friends and relationships . 	0
PE	8700	Discussing and debating Projects together increase working ability because all we know that the target can be reached fast thanks to working of many people . 	0
PE	8701	Interaction has been an advantage for workers at offices . 	1
PE	8702	The best condition might not be good for people . 	0
PE	8703	Everyone has happy moments during their life . 	0
PE	8704	School memories 	0
PE	8705	In my opinion , childhood is the happiest time of a person ' s life . 	1
PE	8706	These happy moments are both in their childhood and their adulthood . 	0
PE	8707	They do not have to worry about bills , jobs , how would their life be in the future . 	0
PE	8708	First , in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood . 	1
PE	8709	Third , technology has also played a great role in reducing the separation between learning a foreign languge in our own country . 	1
PE	8710	A large number of foreign language courses are available online and there are various forums where people can discuss their problems on different foreign languages . 	0
PE	8711	So , it is very easy to learn a foreign in our own country . 	1
PE	8712	Also , highly qualified foreign language teachers are easily accessible in various schools and colleges . 	0
PE	8713	A child ' s daily life is school , playing and sleeping . 	0
PE	8714	To sum up , it is better for people to learn a foreign language in their own country . 	1
PE	8715	It is cost effective and there is a pool of opportunities available now to accomplish the same . 	1
PE	8716	They just worry about two things : to have fun , learn and be happy . 	0
PE	8717	Firstly , many facts about solar system can be discovered . 	1
PE	8718	Therefore , it is unwise to smoke in a restaurant as well as other public places , and relevant state laws should be codified to strictly prohibit it . 	1
PE	8719	My country need to focus more on the agriculture by establishing centers for research in this field , which will have some very positive consequences on agriculture people work , on the economy and on the employment . 	1
PE	8720	This , on the other hand , can indirectly decrease the restaurants ' popularity because fewer people are willing to consume there due to their unpleasant experiences . 	0
PE	8721	The smoke exhaled from the smoker often makes other people feel uncomfortable or disgusted , thus affecting their mood in having their meals . 	0
PE	8722	Not only does it aggravate his health , making him more subject to respiratory diseases , but also it damages his public image and reputation . 	0
PE	8723	Lastly , smoking does no good to the smoker himself . 	1
PE	8724	At this point , the public are likely to believe that the smoker lacks basic civility and should not be encouraged to be a public leader . 	0
PE	8725	This is especially true when the smoker is a popular political figure or an entertainmening celebrity , because most people see smoking in restaurants as an impolite human behavior . 	0
PE	8726	It spoils the smoker ' s reputation and threats other people ' s health . 	0
PE	8727	To conclude , smoking in a restaurant is a harmful and disrespectable behavior . 	1
PE	8728	However , the current cost of medicines is , in fact , reasonable and based on the medicines ' effectiveness . 	1
PE	8729	Apparently , the process of researching , testing and producing drugs in masses costs a substantial amount of money . 	0
PE	8730	It is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour . 	0
PE	8731	For instance , I always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home . 	0
PE	8732	Not only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads . 	0
PE	8733	Secondly , investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work . 	1
PE	8734	Those bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried . 	0
PE	8735	All of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes . 	0
PE	8736	Last but not least , spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality . 	1
PE	8737	In contrast , if the roads are enlarged , everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions . 	0
PE	8738	What ' s more , a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier . 	0
PE	8739	We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents because a part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities . 	0
PE	8740	I could adapt this method to use my real life . 	0
PE	8741	Nevertheless , supporters would argue that zoos , which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals , would provide better care for the animals inside . 	1
PE	8742	It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives . 	1
PE	8743	To begin with , it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings . 	0
PE	8744	From my perspective , animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos . 	1
PE	8745	Preserving wild animals in zoos is an issue which frequently generates a great deal of heated debate , with supporters maintaining that wild life would be taken good care from professionals , while opponents claim that the animals are deprived of freedom as a result of staying in zoos . 	0
PE	8746	Zoos should be built to protect rural animals 	0
PE	8747	As a result , the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression . 	0
PE	8748	Moreover , if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period , it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures . 	0
PE	8749	Apparently , the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss . 	0
PE	8750	Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals , it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in . 	1
PE	8751	Needless to say , such unpreventable illnesses as cancer or HIV will cost the victim a fortune , not to cure , but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years . 	0
PE	8752	Similarly , if humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health-care product , obesity , myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance . 	0
PE	8753	No one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes , especially at primary level , in the hope of raising people ' s awareness . 	1
PE	8754	Children should be taught about balanced diets , nutritious food as well as harmful ones , thereby they will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle . 	0
PE	8755	What is more , it is much easier for people at early ages to form a habit of , for instance , not consuming too much fast food , over-fried food or intoxicants . 	0
PE	8756	In addition , it will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases . 	1
PE	8757	Prevention is better than cure 	0
PE	8758	There has always been a saying in medicine : " Prevention is better than cure " . 	0
PE	8759	This statement has raised a question whether the government should allocate a large sum out of the national health budget to educating and phasing in health-protected measures . 	0
PE	8760	In my opinion , this plan should be put into practice for the two reasons mentioned accordingly . 	1
PE	8761	The computer games are like cigerate to adults and we need to set up rules to regulate this area . 	0
PE	8762	In conclusion , I believe it is better that children are not be allowed to play the computer games . 	1
PE	8763	It is not uncommon that the teenages are found sleepless for several days playing on-line games at public internet bar , and there are also some media reports regarding the sudden death case of the teenages in the internet bar . 	0
PE	8764	But we have to realize the fact : majority of the students failed in front of the computer games playing and they use their time for studying , sleeping and physical exerice to play these computer games . 	0
PE	8765	So that , I disagree with this notion . 	0
PE	8766	Thus , paying for teacher base on grade that students got is not appropriate , and it is not fair for teacher . 	1
PE	8767	In conclusion , I strongly hold my point that any descriptions of crimes should not go unchecked as any longer , as they may be false , may further drive up the already-high crime rate and may bring even more suffering to the victims of crimes . 	1
PE	8768	Without their consent , this could only add to theses innocent people ' s mental suffering and they may do some extreme actions . 	0
PE	8769	Everyone is different . 	0
PE	8770	In conclusion , a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being . 	1
PE	8771	Some students are fast learner , but some students are not . 	0
PE	8772	Although students are in the same process of education system , learning abilities in each students are not equal . 	0
PE	8773	Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule . 	1
PE	8774	In these short time , it is not possible for teachers to pay attention to individual students in class . 	0
PE	8775	Knowledge is the base of creativity . 	0
PE	8776	The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world , inspires children and encourage them to create new things . 	1
PE	8777	However , with highly advanced technology , children are able to get information from foreign countries and even communicate with foreign friends . 	0
PE	8778	Therefore , they will be able to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking . 	0
PE	8779	Second , technology widen children ' s knowledge . 	0
PE	8780	In the past , children were only able to see things from one perspective . 	0
PE	8781	In the end , he successfully invented a computer that was easy to use and lightweight . 	0
PE	8782	However , this , if occurring , should be seen as a result of the ever-increasing innovations in media technology and in our modern life as a whole . 	0
PE	8783	In conclusion , it might be unpleasant for some advocating newspapers to witness the extinction of the type of media . 	0
PE	8784	At this point , newspapers ' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive . 	1
PE	8785	This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today . 	0
PE	8786	Last , but not least , when taking environment into consideration , people must conceive that the more newspapers are published , the more trees are cut down . 	0
PE	8787	For this reason , the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply , possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time . 	1
PE	8788	The answer , perhaps , is that hardly would rational people do so . 	0
PE	8789	The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same , even usually less information than those he can have with the internet ? 	0
PE	8790	It is clear to recognize that the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries . 	0
PE	8791	All in all , the immigrants should follow the customs in the new country , which can help them survive from the culture shock sooner , and assimilate to a new culture . 	1
PE	8792	If the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia , they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated . 	0
PE	8793	Their houses and private cars were buried by local people , because the locals were jealous of Chinese people , who had so much wealth , which should have been theirs . 	0
PE	8794	Although being much richer than local people , they faced the discrimination . 	0
PE	8795	While the Indonesians stopped working at 4 : 00 pm and went home for rest , Chinese immigrants were still working . 	0
PE	8796	They formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it . 	0
PE	8797	One example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969 . 	0
PE	8798	The local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society . 	0
PE	8799	When people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one , they regard themselves as a special group in the new country . 	0
PE	8800	In order to prevent the disappearance of the historic buildings , some citizens suggest the government to spend money on historic buildings . 	0
PE	8801	On the other hand , economy is always correlate with politics , students can study specialized knowledge along with some Politian status , which may open their vision toward the nation and don ' t get limited in the textbooks . 	0
PE	8802	The city where I was born used to be of a great antique beauty , which was surrounded with by lots of ancient style buildings . 	0
PE	8803	The city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity 	0
PE	8804	Nevertheless , we also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade . 	0
PE	8805	They point out that it is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use . 	0
PE	8806	On the whole , I do believe that taxes paying for state schools are necessary to be compulsory for all members of society no matter where their children enroll in . 	1
PE	8807	As far as I am concerned , we should do our parts to do what ever it takes to protect old buildings , letting next generations still have a chance to look at them . 	1
PE	8808	For example , when somebody mentions Beijing , China ' s capital city , you will immediately have Capital Palace come to appear in your mind , because it is the most remarkable sign of the city , and also it is the inevitable history of Beijing , even the entire China . 	0
PE	8809	By seeing historic buildings - - whether related to something famous or recognizably dramatic , people are able to witness the aesthetic and cultural history of an area . 	0
PE	8810	The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system . 	0
PE	8811	They may feel more readily to learn the knowledge in this field and save much time , with that they are able to study more efficiently and more deeply than other students . 	0
PE	8812	That as well would provide the students with more confidence and let them become more compatible . 	0
PE	8813	Considering all those factors above , I suggest the basic course of economic is necessary . 	1
PE	8814	It is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society . 	0
PE	8815	When others are still struggling in preparing their resume , one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process . 	0
PE	8816	Some may argue that as time is different , the condition of job market is completely different . 	0
PE	8817	Therefore , choosing a job similar to one ' s parents ' is not always a correct decision . 	1
PE	8818	Nevertheless , since parents have worked in tens of years , they have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry . 	0
PE	8819	They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children . 	1
PE	8820	For instance , they know which company has better welfare or provides better education . 	0
PE	8821	Moreover , their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies . 	0
PE	8822	I hope people gain this skill because after that they will endorse my choice . 	0
PE	8823	Gaining more skills by study , having more than one job , and handling more tasks are the benefits of it which overweighs its disadvantages . 	1
PE	8824	To sum up , I completely approve of the statement which says people should work faster even more risky . 	1
PE	8825	Even if we ignore this result , by the same token , you can get higher position and more money . 	0
PE	8826	It turns you to a person who has skill of working without hesitation . 	0
PE	8827	Whereas , the scholars are facing a lot of difficulties apart from their high requirements of previous education , they has a lot to face the other difficulties and burden while getting admission such as accommodation , food , traveling , clothing , etc . Moreover , it is hard to get manage two things at a time for instance , working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars , they need to concentrate on their studies . 	0
PE	8828	MPhils and PhDs scholars are probably engage in the research work , which takes their full concentration and surveys . 	0
PE	8829	University is more likely to become a money making business , the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students . 	1
PE	8830	In today ’ s world education is getting expensive , and people are tending to apply for self-finance education in order to get the admission . 	0
PE	8831	I believe that universities should provide free of cost education to the interested scholars because now-a-days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability . 	1
PE	8832	I have observed that many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities because they have to think about work along with the studies , and this left them with only one choice , which is work . 	0
PE	8833	Should University education be free for everyone interested ? 	0
PE	8834	A famous proverb “ Knowledge is power ” has demonstrated the value of education . 	0
PE	8835	The idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities . 	1
PE	8836	Therefore , universities have to look over the issues face by most of the scholars ; their message should be spread education , not making money , and motivate those scholars who want to get education . 	1
PE	8837	To sum up , living with parents longer brings about memories with parents , less cost , and advice from parents . 	1
PE	8838	It is generally believed that , the second-hand smoke , which comes from the smoker ' s mouth , puts an even greater threat on surrounding people ' s health than the smoker himself . 	0
PE	8839	First of all , although it is too strong to assert that smoking should be prohibited everywhere in the society , one smoking in a restaurant is considered to enjoy his time with the ignorance of others ' health . 	0
PE	8840	This is because some burned substance in a cigarette can easily deteriorate a person ' s respiratory system after he / she inhales it . 	0
PE	8841	For example , if there is only one person smoking in a restaurant , all others will smoke unconsciously and their health is under attacked . 	0
PE	8842	Smoking brings a person great enjoyment and relief . 	0
PE	8843	Smoking should not be promitted in restaurants or other public places 	0
PE	8844	In this case , I advocate the idea that smoking should be prohibited in restaurants as well as other public places , and that we should support states laws to ban it because smoking not only damages the restaurant ' s environment , but also imposes a potential threat on others ' health . 	1
PE	8845	However , one should not be encouraged to smoke as the cost of other people ' s health . 	0
PE	8846	Additionally , there are Reality TV , television programs in which people are put into artificial environments and situations , for example like " Big Brother " . 	0
PE	8847	To sum up , it is clear that television , magazines and newspapers pay too much attention of peoples ' private lives for all the reasons mentioned above , namely to increase audience or readership and to give exciting and shocking news to a society which feed upon gutter press and Tabloid TV . 	1
PE	8848	Nonetheless , its adverse effects need controlling more reasonably . 	0
PE	8849	In conclusion , I strongly prefer studying in a group of my friends because of some important opportunities gaining with this activity . 	1
PE	8850	In conclusion , I totally believe that technology has a great contribution to our lives and civilization . 	1
PE	8851	We can not neglect profound impact of great technological process on human life . 	1
PE	8852	This is because exploiting and collecting raw materials as well as essential fuels to serve the production of technological products have destroyed nature seriously . 	0
PE	8853	Last but not least , technology may decrease a great deal of creativity in certain groups of people especially children and the youth due to the dependence upon available achievements . 	1
PE	8854	Therefore , I think this matter should be controlled by parents or somehow by directors . 	0
PE	8855	Finally , beside all above mentioned items , the study of youngsters shall always been controlled . 	0
PE	8856	On the other hand , he has to study for the exam . 	0
PE	8857	As a result , people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world . 	1
PE	8858	To begin with , in schools , main task of teacher to give knowledge to students , and this role have to finish in time . 	0
PE	8859	Travelling , social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car . 	1
PE	8860	At the same time , rather than attending any boring lecturers , students can participate to other activities such as debate competition , swimming meet , Basketball and so forth . 	1
PE	8861	From that they can meet other university students and build up the relationships with them . 	0
PE	8862	Additionally , mostly university has taken whole day for the lectures . 	0
PE	8863	Besides , most of the university students are working students in order to manage the expenses during the education time . 	0
PE	8864	Students need to work as part time basis . 	0
PE	8865	Hence , they have to schedule the lectures time , studying time and working time . 	1
PE	8866	Moreover , with the modern technology , students can collect more information from different sources . 	1
PE	8867	For example , from the Internet , students can read many articles and e-books and can watch video tutorials which provide the information more apparently . 	0
PE	8868	However , some lecturers deliver lectures very informative and interesting way . 	1
PE	8869	When the students attend that lectures , they can obviously feel that it was very useful and they did not waste their time . 	0
PE	8870	This is an important factor because you also get more space than you would in a dormitory . 	0
PE	8871	Second , from an economic point of view , people often argue that an apartment is more expensive . 	1
PE	8872	Both options have their advantages and disadvantages . 	0
PE	8873	After considering the level of freedom , the studying conditions and the economic factor , if I had to choose , I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community rather than in the university dormitories . 	1
PE	8874	Apartments vs dormitories at university 	0
PE	8875	Many students prefer to live in the university dormitories while others prefer an apartment in the city . 	0
PE	8876	You are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want . 	0
PE	8877	An apartment offers more privacy because you can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student . 	0
PE	8878	First , an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory . 	1
PE	8879	While in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules , in the apartment you set your own rules . 	0
PE	8880	To my view , I incline to believe qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee ' s competency of their jobs . 	1
PE	8881	Yet , the importance of social skills should not be neglected as those skills can help one to perform their job effectiveness and efficiency by facilitating interaction and communication with others . 	1
PE	8882	Besides , organization have been transformed to customers oriented . 	0
PE	8883	Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction . 	0
PE	8884	Interpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other , especially when conflicts arise . 	0
PE	8885	Better social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way . 	0
PE	8886	On the other hand , it is no doubt that the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers . 	1
PE	8887	It is because people nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently . 	0
PE	8888	Firstly , some people suggest that qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer . 	1
PE	8889	It is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job . 	0
PE	8890	Specifically , people who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience . 	0
PE	8891	Social skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery . 	0
PE	8892	Qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee ' s competency of their jobs 	0
PE	8893	With the increased educational level of workforce , there are growing number of employers seeking criteria other than qualifications such as social skills in their employee selection process . 	0
PE	8894	However , some employers still believe that qualifications should be the most paramount criterion . 	0
PE	8895	The essay intends to explore both sides of arguments and also present my own opinion . 	0
PE	8896	Therefore , requiring students to study in many subjects is good for them . 	1
PE	8897	People can understand more about a country , it is useful to ease tensions between nations . 	0
PE	8898	Secondly , it is crucial to keep one ’ s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin . 	0
PE	8899	For instance , children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends . 	0
PE	8900	In this new environment , parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home . 	0
PE	8901	Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated , in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism . 	0
PE	8902	Hence , it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important . 	1
PE	8903	To conclude , although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one ’ s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures . 	1
PE	8904	As far as I am concerned , sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society . 	1
PE	8905	In present educational system there are variety of competitions in academic area and athletic area for children to attend , which could stimulating the will of children to learn and to achieve the best of them , and also be able to teach them teamwork skill . 	0
PE	8906	Sense of cooperation 	0
PE	8907	A strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers , and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents , to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system . 	1
PE	8908	However , some people think it is better to make children be competitive than cooperative , both the values have its arguments . 	0
PE	8909	Being competitive leads them to success , but could also restrict them in many ways . 	0
PE	8910	Even though a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently , but it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others . 	0
PE	8911	On the other hand , cooperation is also an essential quality for children , no matter in school activities or in communities . 	1
PE	8912	For example , it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project . 	0
PE	8913	After all , in society , there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself . 	0
PE	8914	Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others , which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team . 	0
PE	8915	There are many experiences that are improve my life in many way . 	1
PE	8916	For example , I could improve the way that I solve problems , improve how I take care of my health , and improve to plan my life for future . 	0
PE	8917	For example , in math class , the way that we learnt to find an answer by doing step by step . 	0
PE	8918	Start with find cause of problem and the way to do research to solve the problem . 	0
PE	8919	What is more , it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more . 	0
PE	8920	For instance , one night , my roommate , Millan , brought his friends along . 	0
PE	8921	It is certainly true that some languages are disappearing day by day over the world . 	0
PE	8922	Several languages are in danger of extinction 	0
PE	8923	But the others do not believe it is possible . 	0
PE	8924	Some people , therefore , harbour a view saying that governments should preserve those by spending some budgets on them . 	0
PE	8925	First and foremost , it is easy to realize that languages , especially oral language , are a quite major part of culture of a country . 	0
PE	8926	In my opinion , this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly and this essay will discuss this issue . 	0
PE	8927	The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional , customs and habitants do not exist . 	0
PE	8928	It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country . 	0
PE	8929	If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these precious values , they will be destroyed in the near future . 	0
PE	8930	Thus , it is apparent that tourism has threatened the nature environments . 	1
PE	8931	To conclude , I strongly believe that the tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments . 	1
PE	8932	Another debatable problem is about techniques . 	0
PE	8933	It has been proved that overusing of the electronic devices including mobile phones could lead to higher possibility of suffering hearing loss and even cancers , although the further investigation are needed . 	0
PE	8934	This possibility exists all the time . 	0
PE	8935	There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party . 	1
PE	8936	Moreover , the mobile phone has become a dispensable multifunctional tools in people ' s daily life . 	1
PE	8937	But a more efficient and reliable system can also be invented to guarantee the private information of users . 	0
PE	8938	In conclusion , nothing can be overused without side effects . 	0
PE	8939	Not only used for communication , but it also functions as an Internet browser , a music player , a personal organizer and so forth . 	0
PE	8940	The contribution of the mobile phone to our modern society is prominent and people ' s dependence on it is irreversible , although it has a number of problems that should be well handled . 	1
PE	8941	I agree with this opinion to some extent , but when it comes to the trend , no one can predict it correctly . 	0
PE	8942	The condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash , so that there is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more . 	0
PE	8943	And I never did encounter any disappointments of missing my goals . 	0
PE	8944	In my personal experience , all my accomplishments were backed by my hard work , not my luck . 	1
PE	8945	Luck is something intangible and no one can guarantee that it would ever come your way . 	0
PE	8946	First , if you depend only on luck for all your accomplishments , you are taking a great risk . 	1
PE	8947	Instead if you strive hard to achieve what you want , then your hard work would take you at least closer to your final goal . 	0
PE	8948	If it doesn ' t work , it would be a great disappointment . 	0
PE	8949	There are many instances that luck has brought people things that they never could even imagine . 	0
PE	8950	Luck vs hard work 	0
PE	8951	Therefore I strongly agree with the argument that it is one ' s hard work that helps him reach his target . 	1
PE	8952	However , I do not see any rational in believing in luck to reach one ' s goals . 	1
PE	8953	Hence , I think it is good for us to have hobbies and do physical activities which are different from our work . 	1
PE	8954	Although it may take us a lot of times to develop our personal hobbies , but doing so can bring us a healthy body , a refreshed mind and a way to release pressure and sadness . 	1
PE	8955	Many colleges in foreign countries provide vacations to students after each semester that facilitate student to entertain themselves as well as prepare for their next semester . 	0
PE	8956	However , research done by universities proves that student ' s performance improves if they get regular breaks from their learning , preparation and examination schedule . 	0
PE	8957	So other several , prefer numbers of short breaks during the year so that student can get rejuvenate periodically . 	0
PE	8958	Many people promote one long vacation system of the school because it would help student to start their course or academic year with strong zeal of learning . 	0
PE	8959	Everybody require some break from their tight schedules likewise students also require vacation form their intense academic schedules . 	0
PE	8960	One long vacation or several long vacation 	0
PE	8961	Many educational bodies schedule its small vacations after term exams so that student ' s get relief form exam pressure . 	0
PE	8962	Firstly , several vacations throughout the year will keep stress level of students low . 	1
PE	8963	However , i discern that several small breaks will help students to be active in their academics . 	1
PE	8964	In both the scenario students relief themselves . 	0
PE	8965	However , when we consider about the question that how to win the game , we always find that we need the cooperation . 	0
PE	8966	Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective . 	1
PE	8967	Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance , it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach , and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet , and those who are in charge of the medical care . 	0
PE	8968	The greater our goal is , the more competition we need . 	0
PE	8969	Therefore without the cooperation , there would be no victory of competition . 	1
PE	8970	The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team . 	0
PE	8971	Consequently , no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one ' s success . 	1
PE	8972	A good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want , even though it is not the real needs of the society . 	1
PE	8973	And there are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it . 	0
PE	8974	However , buying habit is a very personal things for individuals , the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy , sometimes it depends on one ' s needs and ability of consumption . 	1
PE	8975	It is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income . 	0
PE	8976	Advertising impact on people ' s choice of consumption 	0
PE	8977	Nowdays , people ' s choice of consumption is heavily affected by various of advertising on television , street , magazine etc . This argument may be true that people will be swayed by the advertising and buy things they do not need it for their life . 	1
PE	8978	For example , in most asian countries , advertisement company usually hire popular singers or actors to advertise the products to boosts the sales , and some people , especially adolescent may buy things from their favourite singer advertised to support their idol instead of to fill their needs . 	0
PE	8979	In addition , products usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement , people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought . 	0
PE	8980	Most of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase . 	0
PE	8981	On the other hand , children and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not , since they do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary . 	1
PE	8982	Therefore , it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens ' tax funds to meet a minority of people ' s needs . 	0
PE	8983	For example , not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot . 	0
PE	8984	Furthermore , putting taxpayers ' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them . 	0
PE	8985	Instead , the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits , which deserves more funds from government . 	0
PE	8986	To summarize , I strongly agree that budgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities , because the former is more essential , non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens . 	1
PE	8987	That is the reason why sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support , because they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis . 	1
PE	8988	Admittedly , the study of art and music is supposed to rely on younger student ' s own interest . 	0
PE	8989	Apparently , this sense towards art is built on the initial study on the art . 	0
PE	8990	Thus , the school should replace some basic science class with some art and music class in order to cultivate student ' s interest of art without adding extra study pressure . 	1
PE	8991	The education of art and music would not work if students resist it . 	0
PE	8992	Art and music are , of course most accessible tools for modern people to liberate themselves from the extremely stressful life . 	0
PE	8993	Obviously , with the improvement of life rhythm , people have currently suffered too much pressure from their studies or jobs , and these pressure are likely to destroy one person if he cannot find a way to emancipate himself . 	0
PE	8994	At this moment , they would totally involve in the ocean of art and their stressful nervous would be relieved . 	0
PE	8995	When enjoying one piece of brilliant paintings , such as the Mona Lisa , people would put all their pressure down on the ground and just think about what the most proficient and mysterious smile in this world stands for . 	0
PE	8996	In a nutshell , in the modern society , since understanding of the lengthen and depth of the world is important and meanwhile people have burdened excessive pressure , younger students ' art and music education should not take the second place . 	1
PE	8997	It helps animals out of extinction . 	1
PE	8998	It is very crucial for learning . 	1
PE	8999	First of all , the zoo gives humans new knowledge . 	1
PE	9000	Also , it is a interesting travel location . 	1
PE	9001	Some people may believe that a zoo is futile in the era of globalization , which people can develop their knowledge fast and easily . 	0
PE	9002	Do you agree or disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose 	0
PE	9003	I believe that the zoo is invaluable for human beings . 	1
PE	9004	However , I do not agree with them . 	0
PE	9005	Inevitably , the zoo is the important place for innate learning . 	0
PE	9006	When you were so young that you did not know many kinds of animals , what should you do if there were no zoo ? 	0
PE	9007	Some people may argue that investing much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family . 	1
PE	9008	However , as a matter of fact , using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality . 	0
PE	9009	Another reason is that most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants because they want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves . 	1
PE	9010	Even they have some spare time , they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study . 	0
PE	9011	Consequently , it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality , but do not waste a lot of time . 	0
PE	9012	Besides , along with the high living standard , requirements of quality products in almost restaurants , nowadays , are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities . 	0
PE	9013	For example , my friend Lee made a mistake that he broke my precious gift . 	0
PE	9014	I want to say that mistakes will be forgotten quickly . 	0
PE	9015	First of all , a mistake does not last for a long time but a friendship lasts forever . 	0
PE	9016	In this essay , I will present two reasons supporting my opinion . 	0
PE	9017	If someone remembers mistake , he or she has a closed mind . 	0
PE	9018	Anybody does not remember mistakes . 	0
PE	9019	There is an argument regrading weather letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship . 	0
PE	9020	Friendship is more important than mistake by a friend , although mistake is terrible 	0
PE	9021	However , I believe that friendship is more important than mistake by a friend , although mistake is terrible . 	1
PE	9022	It is widely accepted by many people that a mistake will return sometimes terrible result . 	0
PE	9023	Schools in big cities may receive more funds from whether the local comities or the government , which may make them more equipped with advanced teaching facilities and attract more excellent teachers . 	0
PE	9024	Our children thus will have a better chance of pursuing high-quality education which is very important for their future development . 	0
PE	9025	If one is seeking a job right in the city or planing somewhere to travel , or just wants to buy a product in a dependable store , he might refer to what he has seen or heard from the advertisements to make a relatively wise choice . 	0
PE	9026	There is also another obvious advantage of living in a big city considering the chance of receiving better education of our offspring . 	1
PE	9027	If one can efficiently acquire the information , then , there might come along more opportunities for him to achieve his goals . 	0
PE	9028	For example , there are various advertisements here an there , whether on the leaflets or on the big screen showing things of all sorts in commercial zones . 	0
PE	9029	But a small town may be less developed to satisfy all these kinds of needs . 	0
PE	9030	Furthermore living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation , like all kinds of information . 	1
PE	9031	In conclusion , if I want to live a more convenient life with more access to modern facilities as well as with more exposure to various opportunities , and have my children receive a better education , a big city is the place to live in . 	1
PE	9032	In addition to basic knowledge like language or science , music and art are usually on the must-learn list of the parents . 	0
PE	9033	Moreover , there are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs . 	0
PE	9034	In addition , pets are important for depressed people as well because their presence make them feel better . 	0
PE	9035	I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view . 	0
PE	9036	Although I agree with the idea that knowing different fields is important . 	0
PE	9037	Things ended up that he joined in a great team , while his friend who only knew financing issues can do nothing but worked in a bank . 	0
PE	9038	Thanks to Jeff ' s hard working during his leisure time , he learned a lot about the history of art . 	0
PE	9039	But , they decided to enroll in the art system after graduated . 	0
PE	9040	They majored in financing when they were in college . 	0
PE	9041	Take my cousin Jeff and his friend as an example . 	0
PE	9042	Second , when you want to translate your major , it is important to know some of the things about different fields . 	1
PE	9043	It is much easier for us to contact than any other person in my department , which made me popular there , and much easier to get the help that I need . 	0
PE	9044	While some of the problems are the Engineering department ' s part , I went there and discussed with the colleagues there , since I have studied some of the engineering courses . 	0
PE	9045	Should we require our young children to learn music and art 	0
PE	9046	Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules . 	0
PE	9047	Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art-imagination . 	0
PE	9048	First , it ' s very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young . 	1
PE	9049	In my opinion , I agree that children should learn music and art in a young age because they do contribute several merits to them . 	1
PE	9050	With this kind of power big cities offer more opportunities for one ' s career advancements and a more chances of higher income that small towns does , and higher income can be the basis of a happier , healthier life . 	1
PE	9051	Furthermore , it ' s undeniable that the economic power of a country is driven by it ' s big cities and the majority of wealth and finance is centered and controlled in big cities . 	0
PE	9052	Finally , although I prefer to live in a big city , I can not help but assure that this is a matter of personal taste , to be clear , I would love to spend some days in countryside to recharge my soul and relieve myself from daily stress . 	1
PE	9053	In my opinion , life in the old days brings more happiness to people than today for several reasons . 	1
PE	9054	Therefore , to conclude my opinion on this statement , I want to mentioned that every experience in life whether it is good or bad always gives us something to learn and keep for life . 	1
PE	9055	I also became more casual and social with others , this experience increased my communication skill and social speaking skills . 	0
PE	9056	I had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted , but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them . 	0
PE	9057	When I moved to college hostel after school , first few days were very unsettling for me because first time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known . 	0
PE	9058	We might be facing a toughest time of life at the time , but when we think back about those moments later in life , we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves . 	0
PE	9059	Our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly . 	1
PE	9060	So , all the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through . 	0
PE	9061	It was said that Thomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb . 	0
PE	9062	Good experiences give us good memories and bad ones teach us lessons for life . 	1
PE	9063	There are many different opinions regarding world culture . 	0
PE	9064	Opinions regarding world culture 	0
PE	9065	However , in my view , a single modern culture is being created by modern technology for the following reasons . 	1
PE	9066	Some people think that all the countries in the world cannot have a single culture . 	0
PE	9067	Teachers give topics to the students who should research on the internet to find data , and then students should type their research by using computer and even give a presentation by using PowerPoint . 	0
PE	9068	Firstly , most of the countries have the same educational system based on technology . 	1
PE	9069	Secondly , new technology has created some similar jobs all around the world . 	1
PE	9070	For example , students who are studying in Iran use the same software , Microsoft , to type their homework or have presentation compared to Canadian students . 	0
PE	9071	For example , many immigrants in Canada who have the degree in computer technology fields can easily go to Canadian universities and find jobs with good salaries . 	0
PE	9072	Computer technology is a growing job in most of the countries , and students are being encouraged to study in this field . 	0
PE	9073	Compared with playing computers every day , doing part-time jobs is the best choice for students to spend their holiday . 	0
PE	9074	Actually , most students will do the part-time job in their holiday , so it will not effect on their study . 	0
PE	9075	Hence , thanks to the information her new friends has provided ; now she is more confidence about her future adult life . 	0
PE	9076	For example , Lisa thought in adult life , work is the core ; but after she knows these friends , she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work . 	0
PE	9077	However , because we do not experience it , it is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be . 	0
PE	9078	Second , parents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life . 	0
PE	9079	Actually , some questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part-time jobs , they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly ; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part-time job . 	0
PE	9080	Therefore , we need part-time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be . 	1
PE	9081	Third , some parents are afraid that the part-time job will effect student ' study . 	1
PE	9082	Therefore , the part-time job can make people understand future life better . 	1
PE	9083	When I want to go to somewhere , I try to find the way to reach to destination . 	0
PE	9084	However , parents should advise and guide their children properly so that they don ' t get misled . 	0
PE	9085	Thus , it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many . 	1
PE	9086	Looking from another perspective , written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages . 	1
PE	9087	With only pictures , everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images . 	0
PE	9088	Nonetheless , this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about . 	0
PE	9089	Furthermore , the primary way of educating students is also by this way . 	0
PE	9090	Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better . 	0
PE	9091	To conclude , both images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect , either images or words . 	1
PE	9092	Hence , for a more meaningful communication , these two elements have their respective roles to play : image to exemplify and words to describe a particular subject . 	0
PE	9093	When children are allowed to play around with computer from a very early age , they get acquainted with the previously mentioned skills and become expert before facing professional world . 	0
PE	9094	For instance , students who used to prepare Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for their school projects , get an edge over others at an early stage of their career . 	0
PE	9095	To avoid being a pessimist , we may try to conquer our distress by sharing our worry with friends or families , doing exercise regularly , and trying to see our troubles in a different way . 	0
PE	9096	Last but not least , corporational policy to to pay less to inferiors is another reason that drives labours to work on different sectors . 	0
PE	9097	For the reasons mentioned above , I believe that people are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification and also are more interested to work on various fields simultaneously to earn more and support themselves . 	1
PE	9098	Consequently , it is necessary that we should reduce and cope with our stress in the goal of balancing our mind and body . 	1
PE	9099	North American economists have published reports after scrutinizing the recent American economic situation that , technology is eliminating more jobs than creating one . 	0
PE	9100	For example , robots , automation and softwares are taking over manual human workers professions such as clerks , interpreters , security services , retails and specially in manufacturing companies . 	0
PE	9101	Thus many people ' s jobs are now at high stake . 	0
PE	9102	The best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs . 	1
PE	9103	Communication in single language would improve the productivity of the world and brings everyone on to the same page . 	1
PE	9104	Working outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household . 	1
PE	9105	Personally , I believe that married women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly . 	1
PE	9106	Why and why not ? 	0
PE	9107	Do married women usually work ? 	0
PE	9108	This is really necessary in cases of her husband ' s low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present . 	0
PE	9109	By taking up a job , a wife can earn more money to support her family life . 	0
PE	9110	Firstly , extra income that women earn will contribute to their family ' s expenses . 	0
PE	9111	I will mention some basic reasons as following . 	0
PE	9112	Secondly , working outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world , strengthen their character and show their capacity . 	0
PE	9113	So , it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money . 	1
PE	9114	Besides , in the past , conducting a research require long hours of searching in library shelves , now all can be done at a click of a button . 	0
PE	9115	You set your own schedules . 	0
PE	9116	In the other hand , living in a dormitory , and being surrounded by students also has some advantages , like being able to get help with any academic issues from them . 	0
PE	9117	This is only partially true , you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper . 	0
PE	9118	Transportation is another issue , you have to go to and return from the university everyday . 	0
PE	9119	You could choose to use public transportation , a cheaper option , or to have a car . 	0
PE	9120	The car is an expensive option , but also offers freedom of schedule and destination . 	0
PE	9121	Lastly , the studying conditions are better in an apartment because you don ' t have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories . 	1
PE	9122	A lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times . 	0
PE	9123	Since in an apartment you don ' t have a roommate , you won ' t have this problem , and as a result you would be able to concentrate better . 	0
PE	9124	For the same reason , you won ' t have a problem if you are the one who wants to play music , bring friends over , or study late at night . 	0
PE	9125	To begin with , famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people . 	1
PE	9126	Hard work make you a professional man / woman which are powerful in his or her job . 	0
PE	9127	Howbeit some people think that luck is cause of a lot of success , but to be frank I cannot agree with them . 	0
PE	9128	I would explore my primary reasons here . 	0
PE	9129	Of course don ' t . 	0
PE	9130	Also it is ridiculous if you think world wide webs such as Google , Yahoo etc . created by chance . 	0
PE	9131	And also when you see an airport ? 	0
PE	9132	Do you think they have built by chance ? 	0
PE	9133	What ' s more important : hard work or luck ? 	0
PE	9134	What do you think when you see a beautiful building ? 	0
PE	9135	Moreover , some of serious movies try to make you think about the dark sides of the world . 	0
PE	9136	" Blood diamond " , an adaptation of a real story in South Africa , focuses on the link between diamonds and conflict . 	0
PE	9137	The movie is humorous and satiric , which leads us to think what is the most valuable of our lives , and it reminds us how important our families are . 	0
PE	9138	Thus , the hidden meanings of serious movies are usually beyond words and images which make us think about ourselves . 	1
PE	9139	As a result , serious movie tell you how to see the world in a different way . 	1
PE	9140	For the above reasons , I prefer to see those serious movies which make people have deep thoughts toward their real lives . 	1
PE	9141	After watching the movie , we may learn a lesson between jewels and death . 	0
PE	9142	Diamonds are not rare or a sign of true love ; indeed , the hidden meaning of a diamond is a cruel reality . 	0
PE	9143	In conclusion , I think students understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact . 	1
PE	9144	Hence , having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently . 	1
PE	9145	However , the teaching should be in a constructive manner and students should not feel that they are being bullied for every expense . 	0
PE	9146	Last but not least , compared with teachers , parents do not have enough time to spend with their children . 	0
PE	9147	Nowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work , hence there is only limited time for them to teach their children . 	0
PE	9148	Thus , it was impossible for them to be a good teacher . 	1
PE	9149	In conclusion , teachers are the best for children ' s education . 	1
PE	9150	Is it necessary to teach children handwriting ? 	0
PE	9151	In this age of modern technology , some people usually underestimate the importance of teaching handwriting for children . 	0
PE	9152	To some people , it is considered as an arduous and time consuming task . 	0
PE	9153	From my point of view , children are those who need to be under instruction of handwriting for several reasons . 	1
PE	9154	Despite the convenience from up-to-date facilities , handwriting still plays a vital role in students ' learning . 	1
PE	9155	Firstly , this approach is a basis tool used in several fields such as taking notes , doing homework and writing . 	0
PE	9156	It enables to improve learners ' spelling capacity and accompany reading or writing disabilities as well . 	0
PE	9157	Under the guidance of parents or teachers , children can benefit from practicing handwriting . 	0
PE	9158	Some people argue that individuals of a country are responsible for many other things apart from paying tax . 	1
PE	9159	In fact , in order to develop a country , citizens must obey laws , which were imposed by the government . 	0
PE	9160	If people are paying taxes , that means they are taking part in the development of their country as well as the country ' s economy . 	0
PE	9161	Therefore , they have fulfilled their duty as a citizen . 	1
PE	9162	It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity , violence , eroticism etc . I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents ; however , in the case of adults being the audience , there ' s really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art . 	1
PE	9163	Let ' s then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals . 	0
PE	9164	If the art displays unreality , the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value ; if the art reflects the reality , then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth ? 	0
PE	9165	It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination , exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated ; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not , it is the public ' s authority to determine how to interpret its meaning . 	0
PE	9166	In a word , the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified . 	0
PE	9167	Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth ? 	0
PE	9168	Innovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life ; however , some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government . 	0
PE	9169	Creative Artists 	0
PE	9170	One of the major concerns against freeing artists ' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society ; however , I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work . 	1
PE	9171	It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it ' s rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists ' will to create . 	1
PE	9172	My personal view is that despite the emphasis of citizen safety , the government should regulate the correct amount of violent and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information . 	1
PE	9173	Citizen ' s only responsibility is to pay taxes 	0
PE	9174	There is a controversial debate around the world about the duties of citizen . 	0
PE	9175	From my perspective , a universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people . 	1
PE	9176	It is especially true if we consider the fact that a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation . 	0
PE	9177	A single international language or not ? 	0
PE	9178	The 21st century has witnessed the sweeping trends of globalization , which raises people ' s concerns about whether a single international language should be a necessity or not . 	0
PE	9179	Therefore , a single international language serves an economic purpose . 	1
PE	9180	Also , a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions . 	1
PE	9181	As businessmen from different countries have access to the same language , they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade , which can intensify the transnational cooperation . 	0
PE	9182	In contrast , without the availability of the same language , there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations , impeding collaborations between them . 	0
PE	9183	They often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives . 	0
PE	9184	Another reason should be mentioned is that adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity , while children are always keen on competition and winning . 	1
PE	9185	In conclusion , a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being . 	1
PE	9186	On the other hand , sometimes I would rather learning on my own . 	1
PE	9187	Another important point is that for practical subjects you have to have a teacher . 	1
PE	9188	Sometimes when learning a course by myself which is hard and confusing to understand and has few sources available , I get discouraged after spending a lot of time . 	0
PE	9189	A good and experienced teacher can help me learn faster and easier . 	0
PE	9190	Different people prefer different styles of learning . 	0
PE	9191	Sometimes it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own 	0
PE	9192	Learning with a teacher can prevent one from being confused and increase the rate and speed of learning . 	1
PE	9193	I think both learning by myself and learning with a teacher could be helpful . 	1
PE	9194	And then he or she will teach me the course efficiently in a short time and therefore I will learn faster and better and won ' t get discouraged and confused . 	1
PE	9195	In this situation , I ' ll look for a teacher and request for help from him or her . 	0
PE	9196	It ' s all the same in every profession . 	0
PE	9197	As we are now live in a competent world , we must show ourselves to be great enough so as to convince the employer that we deserve a better payment . 	0
PE	9198	They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily . 	1
PE	9199	First of all , a worker ' s salary can properly reflect his / her competence and value on his / her career . 	0
PE	9200	From my prospect , I believe that they do deserve this high payment . 	1
PE	9201	They are not paid for no reason . 	0
PE	9202	Therefore , those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways . 	1
PE	9203	Professional athletes and entertainers earn a huge amount of money that is hard to imagine . 	0
PE	9204	Should we pay professional athletes ( entertainers ) a high salary ? 	0
PE	9205	This salary gap between those famous people and us leads to a question-do those professional athletes and entertainers deserve this money ? 	0
PE	9206	Most of the people spending their whole life can never achieve this . 	0
PE	9207	The first reason is life is simple in the past . 	0
PE	9208	They develop broader view and can make a better choice of their future studies or courses . 	0
PE	9209	Taking a break not just has benefits but it also comes with some negative impacts . 	1
PE	9210	Nowadays , all humans compete together . 	0
PE	9211	It is not just becoming common among rich students but also in the poor students . 	0
PE	9212	Students take a break of year or two , some students travel all around the world during this time , and some choose to take up a job . 	0
PE	9213	Taking a break before starting higher education is a good idea 	0
PE	9214	Nowadays , it is an increasingly common trend to take a break before starting university studies . 	0
PE	9215	Student ' s who works tend to gather better financial resources which they can rely on during their university studies . 	0
PE	9216	Since world population getting higher , competition is getting fierce . 	0
PE	9217	Experience gained through traveling to different places , meeting different people and even at job goes long way . 	1
PE	9218	It not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent . 	0
PE	9219	To some extent , it is true . 	0
PE	9220	If you are not able to handle your jobs , then someone will replace you right away . 	0
PE	9221	That is the reason why celebrities nowadays give more good influence on young people than they were previously . 	1
PE	9222	Thus , only money and glamour look are not enough for a person to be recognized anymore , it is importance that they have to have achievements in order to be a muse to youngsters . 	1
PE	9223	People are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology 	0
PE	9224	Even , with the help of ozone machines , bacterias , mold spores , or pesticide in vegetables , fruits and foods will be killed and removed , thus health and life of eaters is assured . 	0
PE	9225	The life today is totally different from half centuries before . 	0
PE	9226	It is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically . 	0
PE	9227	Success in life should be the ultimate goal of a student , which requires more than academic knowledge , but also practical life skills such as cooking , good communication skills and teamwork spirit . 	0
PE	9228	I strongly believe that the public money should be utilized for the benefit of the society and not just for some of them who are not willing to put in more effort to find them a proper work . 	0
PE	9229	I suggest the government look into the background of the people in depth before giving out hand phones to them . 	0
PE	9230	Advances in technology do help humans to solve abundant of problems ; however it also deprives of some things that we had . 	0
PE	9231	Non academic subjects should be removed from syllabus 	0
PE	9232	According to a recent survey , 89% of people have come to think that , since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures , they have to use a lot of time to work hard , to update themselves , to acquire all kinds of skills and so on . 	0
PE	9233	While some people believe that non-academic subjects should be completely removed , I strongly disagree with that . 	1
PE	9234	To begin with , from the health point of view , schools should not only deliver academic subjects . 	0
PE	9235	If physical education is removed from the syllabus , there will be considerable negative effects on students ’ health . 	0
PE	9236	For instance , after studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning , it is better for students to do some outdoor activities , such as stretching , jogging and playing ball games , in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes . 	0
PE	9237	Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people ’ s health , it will also decrease their learning capability . 	1
PE	9238	To illustrate this further , the famous movie ' 3 Idiots ' acted by Amir Khan criticises the education system which is chiefly based on memorising and not being able to apply whatever the students learn . 	0
PE	9239	Arts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country . 	0
PE	9240	Looking from another perspective , there are certain drawbacks if artists are not restricted . 	0
PE	9241	Thus , human rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely . 	1
PE	9242	To cite an example , Malaysia is a multiracial country whereby all the citizens live together in harmony and peace . 	0
PE	9243	They might go deeper into certain aspects that can cause controversies in a country . 	0
PE	9244	Nonetheless , I believe that artists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts . 	0
PE	9245	In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races , this might end up in some chaos among the society . 	1
PE	9246	Allowing them to think freely will give them an opportunity to express themselves as ideas can naturally flow when there are no limitations . 	0
PE	9247	To conclude , it is now evident that there should not be any restrictions on artists ' work . 	1
PE	9248	Thus , they find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal . 	0
PE	9249	As you can see , if the policy of raising salary was supported , the demonstration would not happen . 	0
PE	9250	The proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries . 	0
PE	9251	In this case , students learn things easily . 	0
PE	9252	In China , some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick because these factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people . 	0
PE	9253	Even though local residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories , they cannot feel happiness from high-paying job yet because most of them suffer from cancer or other diseases . 	0
PE	9254	These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness because they feel tired and frustrated after long hour work . 	0
PE	9255	Second , beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs , which are the most fundamental requirements for people . 	1
PE	9256	Few people can feel happiness from their job because they have to continue to work more than 30 years . 	0
PE	9257	For example , Workers in the FOXCONN factory , which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company , just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day . 	0
PE	9258	Factories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil . 	0
PE	9259	In order to build city and factory , people destroy huge forests . 	0
PE	9260	Without beautiful environment , people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety . 	0
PE	9261	Nowadays , the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly . 	0
PE	9262	Besides , pupils often have a tangible competence in order that they can get the highest grade in a group . 	0
PE	9263	In a group of student , the best of those always encourages others to study harder . 	0
PE	9264	Increasing the motivation and competence spirit are another benefit of group-studying . 	1
PE	9265	In addition , such a remarkable effect has incorporation that all students can improve their weak points in a group . 	0
PE	9266	For example , when a group faces with complex math problem , they can share their opinions to solve it . 	0
PE	9267	They can work together for understanding the complicated aspect of a course . 	0
PE	9268	When pupils make a group for studying , all member of group have the same chance to help each other . 	1
PE	9269	I personally prefer studying in a group due to these noticeable features , getting help from other students , improving my attitude for learning , managing my time in an effective way . 	1
PE	9270	When I found the chance of studying in a group with my classmates , I wished I can go back in time and took all my exams again . 	0
PE	9271	Studying alone or in a group 	0
PE	9272	The reason why I think teenage students need to understand the money management basics is , primarily when secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation , students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family , during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence . 	1
PE	9273	In my view , I agree to that fact that higher school students should be made aware of the money management . 	1
PE	9274	In addition , if financial management is taught at an early age , students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status , students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized . 	0
PE	9275	For example , while I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month , I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses , during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses . 	0
PE	9276	It is hoped that more businesses and governments will follow the same initiatives for the interest of the people and the country . 	0
PE	9277	To sum up , the effort to prohibit people from smoking in public area is certainly helping in curtailing the associated health risks and to create a healthy nation . 	1
PE	9278	This example shows the benefit of restricting public smoking to a country as a whole . 	0
PE	9279	This step has curbed down the numbers of smokers in the country and as a result , Brunei remains a place known for its tranquility and cleanliness . 	0
PE	9280	In other words , that they are aware of their deteriorating health and lack of enthusiasm comes with their taste for monotony and safe ideology . 	0
PE	9281	Secondly , their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life . 	1
PE	9282	However , for a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour . 	0
PE	9283	For example , buying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background . 	0
PE	9284	So , to sum it up , both not afraid of difficulties and appreciating common but pleasant things in their lives drive me to believe that most tough experiences in people ' s life path will be a priceless treasure to them . 	1
PE	9285	Remember if you are afraid of encountering difficulties , then you will be in the troubles all the time . 	0
PE	9286	They also point out that these people have to undergo painstaking and industrious training , let alone participate in a great number of contests to be recognized and prove themselves . 	0
PE	9287	In addition , although there are many singers and athletes , few of whom could rise to fame and victory ultimately . 	0
PE	9288	First of all , some people claim that athletes and singers deserve their current salary because they have an exceptional ability that other people do not own . 	1
PE	9289	For example , hardly anyone could play basketball as skillfully as Michael Jordan - a legendary former American player who won several times in the NBA championship . 	0
PE	9290	However , that is not equal to their actual contributions to the society . 	0
PE	9291	I believe that their salary at a lower level would be more appropriate compared with other peoples in scientific or social , economic fields . 	1
PE	9292	Whether athletes and singers are overpaid ? 	0
PE	9293	Some people believe that professional athletes and entertainers are paid reasonable salaries , which can be up to millions of dollars each year . 	0
PE	9294	Overcoming all these obstacles , they should be paid a great deal of money for their extraordinary efforts . 	0
PE	9295	However , their talents should not be overrated . 	0
PE	9296	Many artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people . 	0
PE	9297	Artists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar , hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose . 	1
PE	9298	Like the media , artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely . 	1
PE	9299	However , artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people . 	0
PE	9300	Frank Zappa once said , " Mind is like a parachute , it doesn ' t work if its not open “ . 	0
PE	9301	Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains . 	0
PE	9302	In addition , creativity also gives aesthetic charm . 	0
PE	9303	As a result , they have no choice but choosing English as a second language . 	0
PE	9304	For instance , Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government , just because she raised a social issue . 	0
PE	9305	This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds . 	0
PE	9306	Commuincation can bring many benefits . 	0
PE	9307	It ' s neither to get a translated version of these articles , nor to always have a translator besides . 	0
PE	9308	By relating well to people , we are likely to have a lot of friends and therefore we will have a wide network of communication . 	0
PE	9309	Or , if you are a salesman in a store or any other place , by relating well to your customers , you will increase the chance of their coming back again and becoming your regular customers . 	0
PE	9310	For example , if you need help with getting a job , by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well and therefore they respect you as well , you can achieve your goal . 	0
PE	9311	In sum , though some people may disagree with me , as I explained my reasons and examples above , none of those factors are important and sufficient enough by themselves and we should notice to both of them because each of them has its own benefits . 	1
PE	9312	We are told at what hour we shall wake up , how we shall dress up and how we shall behave . 	0
PE	9313	Working without pressure and interaction are some examples for these disadvantages . 	0
PE	9314	Because the best conditions are sometimes not likely to be good as the expectation of people . 	0
PE	9315	Apart from that , a fair trial can be achieved . 	0
PE	9316	Then , punishment can be given in accordance to the condition . 	0
PE	9317	It is a well known fact that a jury involved in a case has no information regarding the criminal ' s past illegal acts under the British and Australian laws . 	0
PE	9318	Jury must have access to criminals ' past records 	0
PE	9319	I , for one , agree to this resolution whole-heartedly as it poses advantages to various parties as I shall discuss below . 	0
PE	9320	There are few of those who are concerned think the current practice should be altered and that the juries should at least know something about the criminals before coming to a conclusion . 	1
PE	9321	This is because , knowing their background very well will enable the juries to analyze the crime before coming up with a judgment . 	0
PE	9322	First and foremost , I believe that it would be easier for the juries to make a decision if they know about the past information about the criminal . 	1
PE	9323	The juries will be able to know weather the individual committed the crime intentionally or due to circumstances by knowing the facts about the person . 	0
PE	9324	For instance , take a person who has not murdered anyone but is suddenly found to be guilty . 	0
PE	9325	Parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their olde 	0
PE	9326	It might seem that teenaged children particularly in age of 15 - 18 are fully grown , so they do not need any help for making important decisions . 	0
PE	9327	However , in my opinion , teenagers need more attention and help in comparison with the higher ages . 	1
PE	9328	It does not seem unreasonable to suggest that governments spend more money on buses , trains , and subways investment . 	1
PE	9329	Whether governments should invest more money in traffic infrastructure or focus more on developing public transportation has erupted endless controversy . 	0
PE	9330	Nowadays transportation has attracted much social concern . 	0
PE	9331	Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways 	0
PE	9332	The fact is that the more cars and motorbikes are on roads , the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged . 	0
PE	9333	First and foremost , carbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere . 	0
PE	9334	Both these two things are important . 	0
PE	9335	Such public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society therefore they help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air . 	1
PE	9336	In the first place , there is no doubt that parents and other adult relatives are more experienced towards children , therefore they are the best advisor for their children . 	1
PE	9337	This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere , which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment . 	1
PE	9338	If governments use more money to improve roads , there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work . 	0
PE	9339	They have experienced a large numbers of stuffs during their life , so if children listen to their advices they can prevent happening worst things . 	0
PE	9340	In short , although both sides have their equally valid arguments , I am inclined to think that although Internet can be a useful tool for education , at no time will the unique role of human teachers be replaced . 	1
PE	9341	This is where the computer proves to be incompetent . 	0
PE	9342	To begin with , communication between countries and cultures become convenient . 	0
PE	9343	No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally . 	1
PE	9344	Thus , studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters . 	0
PE	9345	In my country , English is a required course from elementary school . 	0
PE	9346	In the present age , it is a matter of fact that increasing minority languages have diminished from the world due to the proliferation of English . 	0
PE	9347	Influence of English - advantages outweigh the disadvantages 	0
PE	9348	Personally , I agree with the former opinion . 	0
PE	9349	Some people claim it ' s a reasonable loss in globalization while others argue the demerits exceed the merits . 	1
PE	9350	This , in turn , enhances relationship and promotes international business . 	0
PE	9351	For them , language obstacle is no longer a problem , which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country . 	0
PE	9352	Researchers indicated that most of natural resources are un-recyclable and only several decades after , the Earth ' s natural resources are totally exhausted . 	0
PE	9353	At that time , human activity will be seriously affected due to the dependence on these resources . 	0
PE	9354	Also , people are endangering other species ' live . 	1
PE	9355	Hunting has been a fundamental activity of human for having food . 	0
PE	9356	Hence , it is evident that individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful . 	1
PE	9357	To wrap it all up , it is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person ' s life in order for one to prosper . 	1
PE	9358	However , it would be wrong to say that one ' s success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions . 	1
PE	9359	Natural talent and hard work also contribute to their progress . 	0
PE	9360	Moreover , parents are not able to function their parental care as the necessary thing to children . 	0
PE	9361	In this way , communication between family members is visibly destroyed . 	1
PE	9362	Last but not least , watching too much television people will unconsciously learn bad behavior that sow division among human . 	1
PE	9363	For example , watching film about terrorist children will be able to consider terrorism as a right thing . 	0
PE	9364	What happens if they do act exactly the terrorist in Hollywood movies does ? 	0
PE	9365	is this one of the reason cause division in society ? 	0
PE	9366	In conclusion , though television has some good sides , it has destroyed communication among friends and family . 	1
PE	9367	We need to quickly find the way to address this problem as soon as possible and the first concern is to reducing violent behaviors that children learn from television . 	0
PE	9368	Therefore , in a small town we can live in big houses with good landscapes , also because of less crowded spaces we have more facilities and more services . 	0
PE	9369	Transportation cost is less than in big cities and we have less traffic so that we can save time and money . 	0
PE	9370	Secondly , another advantage of small towns is living costs . 	1
PE	9371	Living cost is one of the important concerns in every society and then , in a small town living cost is fewer than in big cities . 	0
PE	9372	However it is an obvious fact that people in small town have more happiness and friendship and less illness and stress . 	0
PE	9373	In conclusion , I prefer to live in a small town and I think it has some advantages such as less stress , because of better weather conditions and also , better relationship within a town . 	1
PE	9374	In small town people know each other and have better deal together than big cities therefore on big cities people feel alone and depress more than small cities . 	0
PE	9375	These are two sides of the same coin which can ' t be separated . 	0
PE	9376	I firmly believe that children should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition . 	1
PE	9377	A healthy competition which involves raising one ' s own level above others is the best approach . 	0
PE	9378	Thus , competition and co-operation go hand in hand . 	0
PE	9379	' Your loss , my gain ' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run . 	0
PE	9380	Competition should be always based on self-improvement rule . 	1
PE	9381	This kind of competition gives customers more options . 	0
PE	9382	However , blind and selfish competition is detrimental . 	0
PE	9383	They must be made aware of the demerits of selfish competition . 	0
PE	9384	When co-operation and healthy competition is followed together , success , achievements , recognition and any goal becomes easier . 	0
PE	9385	By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes , we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource . 	0
PE	9386	Lastly , in school , there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice . 	1
PE	9387	The professor provides good answers to you . 	0
PE	9388	They do not mind helping you , and they never leave you alone when you got a problem . 	0
PE	9389	In contrast , in distance learning , these aspects of the professor had reduced their important . 	0
PE	9390	During student ' s free time , they have a number of activities that they can join , such as playing sports , going to lab , or going to library . 	0
PE	9391	These activities lead to more interact with their friends . 	0
PE	9392	Connection with friends improves their IQ abilities , furthermore , they have a chance to learn about their societies . 	0
PE	9393	While the online course keeps the children at their home only . 	0
PE	9394	The professor has been assigned to teach only . 	0
PE	9395	Moreover , there will be a long response from the teachers when children ask them a question . 	0
PE	9396	When I was 14 years old , my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important . 	0
PE	9397	There are dogs who lead blind people around the city and therefore without them they could not go around all alone . 	0
PE	9398	Researchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses . 	0
PE	9399	For example , nowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before . 	0
PE	9400	Computers have opened up a network connection among people . 	0
PE	9401	Computers have an important role in social and personal life . 	1
PE	9402	A large number of industries fire many forces because of doing their works by new technologies and computers . 	1
PE	9403	Despite many advantages , by coming computers many jobs has been vanished . 	0
PE	9404	By contrast , excessive use of computers has brought many difficulties . 	1
PE	9405	Moreover , People can use computers to extract their essential information easily . 	0
PE	9406	Teenagers and adolescents spend free time in front of computers . 	0
PE	9407	This technology makes easier for people to send and receive personal message . 	0
PE	9408	People who have type by computers may suffer from such disease related to knees . 	0
PE	9409	The results show that teenagers who are addicted to computer games show more violent and stressful behaviors . 	0
PE	9410	It varies from individual to individual , how they utilize that period . 	0
PE	9411	But , the break should be an optional thing . 	0
PE	9412	Importantly , the sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them . 	1
PE	9413	A break gives students more benefits than harms . 	0
PE	9414	Countries , like India , where such a break is considered a blot , should understand that young minds are delicate and they face a cut-throat competition . 	0
PE	9415	Thus , a break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies . 	1
PE	9416	One year break can help young people to prepare for the challenges of life . 	0
PE	9417	Your job has more effect on your happiness than your living environment does 	0
PE	9418	With the development of the economy , people become more and more rich . 	0
PE	9419	They start to pay attention to mental requirement like happiness . 	0
PE	9420	While I accept that job can offer happiness to some people , I believe that living environment is more important than job for most of us . 	1
PE	9421	About a year ago I was lucky to become a participant of student brainstorming game . 	0
PE	9422	These advantages are especially important in situations of shortage of time . 	0
PE	9423	In conclusion , from my point of view , type of temper and advantages of individual work are the most persuasive arguments in favor of studying alone . 	1
PE	9424	To my rivals ' surprise , being the only member of my own " team " I gained a victory . 	0
PE	9425	However , people should concern more about their living environment than job . 	1
PE	9426	First , for most of us , job is only a tool to maintain our lives . 	0
PE	9427	If good people always win , we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas . 	0
PE	9428	Then we will feel less interested in them . 	0
PE	9429	However , if the good people always get an happy ending , I don ’ t think it ’ s proper . 	1
PE	9430	First , if all the story end up in the same way , it will be boring . 	0
PE	9431	While there are also some people who do not like this . 	0
PE	9432	Personally , I prefer to see good people get rewarded . 	0
PE	9433	Both sides of the arguments have its merits . 	0
PE	9434	Modern communication technologies such as mobile phones , e-mails and internet chat programs like the MSN Messenger have brought significant changes to our lives in recent years . 	0
PE	9435	Do modern communication technologies benefit all people 	0
PE	9436	To summarize , higher fuel and petrol cost has its own pros and cons . 	1
PE	9437	America , for example , has recently drawn its intervention in Russian crisis only due to the influx of oil . 	0
PE	9438	Suppose that the those countries cut down on its oil support , other nations will have to pay more as well as release beneficial policies for them . 	0
PE	9439	Another point that should be taken into account is countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters , both politically and financially . 	1
PE	9440	However , it disadvantages may outweigh its advantages with regard to economic and politic issues , making it advisable to seek another options to reduce the use of personal cars . 	1
PE	9441	Therefore , I will conclude that technology indeed supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles . 	1
PE	9442	Only when traditional culture is integrated with the modern technology can it be developed in the long run . 	0
PE	9443	They argue that people , especially youngsters , are crazier about fresh and advanced things , such as digital products , thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques . 	0
PE	9444	But I believe this is not the issue because people tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years . 	0
PE	9445	In fact , many tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture . 	0
PE	9446	On the other hand , some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles . 	1
PE	9447	Additionally , technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage , making it more vivid and appealing . 	1
PE	9448	For example , China has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo , using a variety of state-of-the-art technological methods , such as robots and LED screens . 	0
PE	9449	In other words , those who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination . 	1
PE	9450	Secondly , if you believe that hard work is the key to success , it would make you a visionary person . 	0
PE	9451	All advantages considered , classmates are unrivalled by the children ' s parents as they provide tremendous incentive and horizon expansion , two crucial commodities leading to a successful presentation at school . 	1
PE	9452	Sharing the same age , children are at their most comfort to exchange ideas , to query and interpret abstract concepts without fear of parental punishments , resulting in deeper comprehension . 	0
PE	9453	Under the circumstances , he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work . 	0
PE	9454	To compare with the school life , they might suffer only a small punishment at school . 	0
PE	9455	For instance , if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work , the company may reduce his payment or even fire him . 	0
PE	9456	Secondly , by taking a part-time job , they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done . 	1
PE	9457	Due to the reasons given above , to encourage children taking a part-time job is a good choice for them to get prepared for adult life . 	1
PE	9458	In conclusion , to help their children to adapt adult life , parents should let them experience it as much as they can . 	1
PE	9459	Secondly , the new high school will be a place for new connections between the student of different communities and districts of the city . 	1
PE	9460	They will study with new breath and great enthusiasm in new school . 	0
PE	9461	Without their research , there will be less information of our ancestors to be known on the earth . 	0
PE	9462	Without their research , there will be more artcrafts being ruined by nothing . 	0
PE	9463	Although some of my neighbors will oppose this idea , personally I approve it . 	0
PE	9464	New high school 	0
PE	9465	The high school of my district is pretty old and lacks in necessities for students , so they can ' t get enough education . 	1
PE	9466	The new high school will bring a lot of advantages to my community . 	1
PE	9467	Firstly , I think that the new high school will bring a lots of opportunities for student concerned in education . 	1
PE	9468	I really believe that new high school is a great addition to the educational system of my community . 	1
PE	9469	Also the laboratory of physics and chemistry was in bad condition , so the students can ' t study well during the classes . 	0
PE	9470	Their old high school is pretty old and need in new educational materials , repairing of the place for sport activities . 	0
PE	9471	I belive this , due to the fact that these schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an appropriate education to their students . 	1
PE	9472	Ultimately I feel that schools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right . 	1
PE	9473	I support the points of those who say that standardized tests are required over those who don ’ t because if the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them . 	0
PE	9474	In any class there will be students who will show low academic performance , so teachers could work with them more intensively . 	0
PE	9475	Finally , I think that requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice , since in this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students . 	1
PE	9476	Thus , it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests , as long as this option helps to both sides . 	1
PE	9477	However , standardized tests offer them such chance . 	0
PE	9478	For example , after many years of teaching experience , teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries , facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills . 	0
PE	9479	By contrast , parents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way . 	0
PE	9480	However , in comparison to teachers , parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children ' s subjects such as mathematics and physics . 	0
PE	9481	Furthermore , teaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children ' s communication skills . 	1
PE	9482	In the first place , school teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education . 	1
PE	9483	For instance , to be able to obtain the teacher certificates , people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge . 	0
PE	9484	Indeed , children grow up with two important people , their parents and teachers , and both are important in children ' s development . 	0
PE	9485	As far as I am concerned , I agree with the view that the teacher is the best option for children ' s education in some aspects . 	1
PE	9486	Teacher is the best option for children ' s education in some aspects 	0
PE	9487	Recently , there has been a social concern with regard to who is the best teacher for children ' s education . 	0
PE	9488	Our youth has become very confident towards his career . 	0
PE	9489	In addition , sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe . 	0
PE	9490	On the other hand , the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology . 	1
PE	9491	First , critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom . 	1
PE	9492	This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures . 	0
PE	9493	That is because , many zoos , especially the ones in developing countries , do not provide care and attention which their animals require . 	0
PE	9494	The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment . 	0
PE	9495	Keeping animals in zoos 	0
PE	9496	Since the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized . 	0
PE	9497	Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important , whereas , others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong . 	0
PE	9498	Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn . 	0
PE	9499	To sumarize , there should never be any replacement for traditional skills or ways of life . 	1
PE	9500	They are the ones that teach , and will teach us to be self-esteem and experienced , which means their preservation throughout history deserve our attention . 	1
PE	9501	First of all , when people face with a failure they can learn a large number of things from that failure , therefore in the next effort they try to avoid doing and repeating that mistakes . 	1
PE	9502	For instance , most of inventors in the first phases of their job face with some problems and defeats , but in the next stages they learn how to deal with problems . 	0
PE	9503	Second of all , experience shows while people doing a job constantly , they become more experienced in that subject , so in the final effort they become successful with the high percentile . 	1
PE	9504	For example , scientists experiment a substance for a long time , after they gain lots of experience and knowledge about that subject they decide to make it final . 	0
PE	9505	The expression " Never , never give up " means keep trying and never stop working 	0
PE	9506	Many individuals throughout their life face with at least one failure in different areas such as education , love and economy . 	0
PE	9507	Some believe when a person faces with a failure the best way is to forget that and releases that ; however , I completely disagree with this idea . 	0
PE	9508	I always believe that a defeated person has to try and try until to achieve her or his goal . 	1
PE	9509	To sum up , I would maintain that people should not give up when they face with a failure . 	1
PE	9510	In opposite , they have to learn new points from that failure , and they become more experienced . 	1
PE	9511	Apparently , more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it . 	0
PE	9512	On the other hand , growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment . 	1
PE	9513	These days , millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure . 	0
PE	9514	It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people , particularly for the lower income group . 	1
PE	9515	Moreover , travels also help to promote the tourist industry development , boost the economy and job markets of many countries . 	0
PE	9516	They can develop their careers , broad their knowledge , and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds . 	0
PE	9517	In recent years , many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights . 	0
PE	9518	Cheap air travel should be encouraged ? 	0
PE	9519	Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged , I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem . 	1
PE	9520	People have various different views about cheap air travel . 	0
PE	9521	Overcoming problems teaches the students how to be more mature and self-independence . 	0
PE	9522	One other important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies . 	1
PE	9523	For example , students might face many challenges in the host country . 	0
PE	9524	Therefore , they should be able to deal with the obstacles that they may encounter . 	0
PE	9525	First of all , students who study outside their countries can get a lot of experience living in a foreign country . 	1
PE	9526	Living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one ' s character . 	0
PE	9527	Studying abroad is one very common thing that students do , and they have different reasons for that . 	0
PE	9528	Benefits of students doing extra jobs 	0
PE	9529	In present day and age , students are normally exposed to extra jobs as early as they start their university . 	0
PE	9530	This phenomenon , although in some extents , are proved to have negative effects , I feel strongly that the disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages . 	0
PE	9531	In this essay , some of the benefits surrounding this matter will be carefully explained . 	0
PE	9532	It is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs . 	0
PE	9533	Part-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities . 	0
PE	9534	In addition , that seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities . 	0
PE	9535	As a result , students who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands-on experience . 	0
PE	9536	Moreover , having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation . 	1
PE	9537	Secondly , students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones . 	1
PE	9538	In the conclusion , I would like to say that the more attention is withdrawn to a problem of physical education , the more influence we can get on academic success of students . 	1
PE	9539	Human activities are harming the Earth 	0
PE	9540	Alike , the school basketball team gains more knowledge on how to succeed in some particular kind of throwing the ball into hoot practicing rather than learning theoretically . 	0
PE	9541	Furthermore , almost all natural science discoveries were made by direct observation , which is a part of physical education . 	0
PE	9542	Last , but not least , financial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is . 	1
PE	9543	For instance , the money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare , since the nation is comparatively healthy . 	0
PE	9544	Along with that , physically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development . 	0
PE	9545	As a matter of fact , the better a person feels , the better his brain works . 	0
PE	9546	Therefore , putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society . 	1
PE	9547	As hence it ends up with financially competitive country . 	0
PE	9548	But they did not know that compared with hand washing dish-washing machine consume at least 2 times water and electricity to wash these tableware . 	0
PE	9549	As you can imagine , if thousands of families use dish-washing machines , how many water and how much electricity will be wasted ! 	0
PE	9550	In many countries , children are educated from their young age to be independent and responsible for their actions . 	0
PE	9551	Secondly , large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer . 	1
PE	9552	To start with , because of extensive of using machines , many people loss their job . 	0
PE	9553	Importance of ozone layer is evident by the fact as it protects us from harmful ultra violet rays . 	0
PE	9554	When they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies , doing housework and keeping shops , they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life . 	0
PE	9555	Apart from this , using of machines are also pose serious pollution and energy dissipation . 	0
PE	9556	For example , nowadays people prefer to use dish-washing machine to wash dishes and plates rather than hand washing . 	0
PE	9557	Therefore , children may see that this behavior is inexcusable . 	1
PE	9558	On the other hand , too much news coverage to famous people seems to have a negative influence on the choice of children of their future professions . 	1
PE	9559	Question about the influence of the media coverage of celebrities 	0
PE	9560	Today , celebrities appear to become a spotlight of the mass media . 	0
PE	9561	Almost half of the news coverage on television and the Internet is devoted to the celebrity gossip . 	0
PE	9562	Not surprisingly , many people are worried that this attention to the famous people has an impact on them , especially on their children . 	0
PE	9563	This essay will compare both negative and positive consequences of this effect on infants . 	0
PE	9564	Fame is a great responsibility for public people as their admirers are very sensitive to any acts of their idols . 	0
PE	9565	Celebrity scandals and gossips can quickly reach the public which perceive it very negatively . 	0
PE	9566	This means that celebrities who received attention for overuse of drugs or alcohol are likely to get public disgrace . 	0
PE	9567	This will address students ' interests because it ' s the assignment that needs real life participation . 	0
PE	9568	For example , in law class , students are informed their rights and duties and they are taught how they can apply law to different situations that might happen upon them . 	0
PE	9569	When any one of the situations occurs , they can think independently and figure out how to react . 	0
PE	9570	In conclusion , using life experiences and examples to demonstrate the knowledge on a subject is an effective way to attract students ' attention and keep them eager on learning , not only because it reinforces students ' impression on the knowledge but also invites students to practice the knowledge out on their own . 	1
PE	9571	For example , instead of driving each one ' s car , if we put forty people in a bus , it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city . 	0
PE	9572	Although , I am agree with the idea that reducing of the car use will be achieve in twenty years . 	0
PE	9573	Second , a driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world . 	0
PE	9574	So , with the risen of the aware to the environment , people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not . 	1
PE	9575	Of course , it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places . 	0
PE	9576	However , no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on , it always have some other ways that you can do , you can ride a bike , or even walk on your feet . 	0
PE	9577	I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view . 	0
PE	9578	People who hold different opinion may argue that a personal car uses is in need because a public transportation can ' t meet every place . 	1
PE	9579	It not only helps you to reduce the car use , but also good to your health . 	0
PE	9580	In this way , this won ' t be a problem at all . 	0
PE	9581	Thus , I believe that there are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers . 	1
PE	9582	Moreover , schools are also improve their quality because they have high performance teachers . 	1
PE	9583	Furthermore , students are easy to understand their subjects . 	0
PE	9584	Hence , we do not have time to spend for healthy activity such as going to a gym or doing other sports . 	0
PE	9585	This makes us a lazy person who prefers to do sedentary activities like watching television shows rather than be active and sociable . 	0
PE	9586	Second , I think watching television programs makes us lazy . 	1
PE	9587	We usually spend our times in front of television for at least three ours a day when we come back home after eight-hour working in the office . 	0
PE	9588	These genre of programs has more negative effects on our teenagers . 	0
PE	9589	They usually try to mimic what they see on movies in their daily behaviors . 	0
PE	9590	Last but not least , some television programs have a negative effect on viewers . 	1
PE	9591	Some thriller or action movies advertise negative activities such as doing criminal activity . 	0
PE	9592	To sum up , killing our time , making us lazy , and advertising negative behaviors are just only few reasons to show how television is destructive . 	1
PE	9593	I think it is a global problem to solve this problem and it is need global contribution to find a solution . 	1
PE	9594	It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me . 	0
PE	9595	Definitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me . 	0
PE	9596	I don ' t want to disavow the role of luck in success , but as you know it hardly accompany us . 	0
PE	9597	So , for example you prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question . 	0
PE	9598	If they working at multinational company as the result is they can earn higher salary . 	0
PE	9599	Naturally , children will be growing up and looking for their job . 	0
PE	9600	Since , some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard , so they will never try to solve problems on their own . 	0
PE	9601	Additionally , standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice . 	0
PE	9602	In addition , many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class , so the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them . 	0
PE	9603	Therefore , exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students . 	0
PE	9604	For example some students are not so active on the lessons , cause they are already familiar with the issue . 	0
PE	9605	Firstly , standardized tests are preferable due to the fact that they help teachers to fairly grade the students . 	1
PE	9606	However , I believe that standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge . 	1
PE	9607	This issue is important because nowadays many people cast doubt on it . 	0
PE	9608	The issue at hand is if the schools should require students to take regular standardized exams . 	0
PE	9609	Students should be required to take regular standardized tests 	0
PE	9610	This ideal , however , doesn ' t necessarily be accomplished . 	0
PE	9611	That may help you expand experiences , look for your personalities and find your new talents . 	0
PE	9612	You may love to try new things and take risks even if you aren ' t good at the things . 	0
PE	9613	In summary , even though some people claim the convenience of automobile , I would state that alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion . 	1
PE	9614	Without doubt , the more time you spend on what you do well , the more likely to achieve something great you will be . 	0
PE	9615	Focusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal . 	0
PE	9616	So , I definitely believe that you should focus on what you are good at . 	1
PE	9617	If not , you might lose another chance that you could use to accomplish other things . 	0
PE	9618	For instance , a conducted experiment indicates out-performance in skills like differentiate types of plants or animals of a child that experienced various activities in nature to a child spent most of his time watching documentaries . 	0
PE	9619	On the other hand , children who have had such activities that interrelate to creativity , cooperation , competition tend to perform significantly better in general terms . 	0
PE	9620	Secondly , watching television is a very passive action and should not be promoted by increasing periods spent on it . 	1
PE	9621	Therefore , teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens . 	1
PE	9622	Additionally , it still performs at its best to equip a child with essential skills . 	1
PE	9623	School has been applying traditional teaching procedure since for ages . 	1
PE	9624	In conclusion , despite the fact that learning by watching TV suits some children , kids should never be encourage to engage in such passive activity . 	1
PE	9625	As a result , such activities can equip a child necessary skill that is useful for his future career . 	0
PE	9626	In conclusion , even though newly developed plant foods and machinery make significant financial success for the farmers , it is convincing that the demerits of applying these new developments in the agriculture industry cannot be overlooked . 	1
PE	9627	For another , mechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry , possibly because high-end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields . 	0
PE	9628	In contrast , manual harvest prevents severe environmental damages . 	0
PE	9629	One is that it worsens the air pollution by releasing the excessive exhaust emission . 	0
PE	9630	In conclusion , I disagree with the idea that salary outweighs any other motivators , as there are other even more important aspects such as : friendly co-workers , working conditions and professional achievements . 	1
PE	9631	Biomedical engineers could make a significant effect on increasing life expectancy the world . 	0
PE	9632	Another technological innovations which help people around the world is related to medical equipments . 	1
PE	9633	In the past time doctors used pig heart ' s valve to implant , but the patient could not be alive more than 3 years after the replacement . 	0
PE	9634	For example , one of their inventions was related to artificial heart valves which can be count as a turning point in heart surgeries . 	0
PE	9635	To sum up , technology has helped us to have more comfortable life . 	1
PE	9636	But now , biomedical engineers can make artificial heart valves which works well and doctors can implant them easily . 	0
PE	9637	You can see its effects on transportation , communication , medicine and so forth . 	1
PE	9638	Zoos are big outdoor spaces in which different animal species are kept , so that people can look , learn and admire them . 	0
PE	9639	If you did , it was probably at a zoo . 	0
PE	9640	Have you ever seen a real life bear or a monkey ? 	0
PE	9641	Zoos have no useful purpose ? 	0
PE	9642	In the zoo they interact with each other and are able to relax and look at the animals , play with some of them , comment on their appearance and behavior , and laugh at their funny customs . 	0
PE	9643	When people visit the zoo , they normally do it in a group , with their families , or as a part of a school group activity . 	0
PE	9644	I strongly disagree with this affirmation because I believe zoos provide social interaction , education , and develop qualities such as animal respect and understanding . 	1
PE	9645	A lot of people think that zoos have no use , or provide no purpose . 	0
PE	9646	This could help students to learn how to deal with people , how to collaborate with people in their group . 	0
PE	9647	The zoo is a great reason for spending time with the family , it is a great activity that can be enjoyed every family member , from little children to grandparents . 	1
PE	9648	Nowadays families do not spend as much time together as they used to a couple of decades ago . 	0
PE	9649	All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life . 	0
PE	9650	In conclusion , I disagree with the opinion that children who are brought up in less well-of families are , likely , more successful in the future life due to aforementioned reasons . 	1
PE	9651	For instance , many good medicines cost vast amounts of money , which cannot be afforded by poorer families . 	0
PE	9652	Finally , wealthy families can afford better health services and costly medicines , which will be very beneficial for the health of a child . 	1
PE	9653	International aid is critical because people from other countries may be facing much more serious problems . 	1
PE	9654	My view is that international aid should be prioritised . 	1
PE	9655	They lack food , water or clothes which keep them warm , not to mention the education needs . 	0
PE	9656	Many people , for example in some African countries , are living below the basic standards . 	0
PE	9657	The world has become more prosperous than ever yet a great number of people are still living in poverty or suffering by wars or disasters . 	0
PE	9658	International aid 	0
PE	9659	However , it is controversial whether the help should go to the people who need it most or the citizens of the country where the charity organisations are located . 	0
PE	9660	Charity organisations have been playing an important role to provide support to those people . 	0
PE	9661	It is clear that those people are in desperate need of international support . 	0
PE	9662	What is worse , people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security , homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members . 	0
PE	9663	However , when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation , what we are concerned about is not the whole society , but the development of an individual ' s whole life . 	0
PE	9664	In order to survive in the competition , companies continue to improve their products and service , and as a result , the whole society prospers . 	0
PE	9665	To sum up , students can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say . 	1
PE	9666	It is out of of the questioned that the persistence of learning a knowledge in the childhood is more than other period of lives . 	0
PE	9667	By considering this and being aware of that students have not any responsibility and other difficulty in comparison with a young man , we can infer that why this time is the best time to learn any language . 	1
PE	9668	These are important foundation of modern civilization . 	0
PE	9669	Protection of tradition can provide the possibility to better understand ancient culture and utilize them to tackle modern problems . 	0
PE	9670	Meanwhile , due to the fact that traditional skills rely little on fossil energy , it is more environmentally-friendly , which should be promoted to reduce the threat of climate change . 	0
PE	9671	Furthermore those tradition-related things convey traditional culture and values . 	0
PE	9672	Although technology takes convenience to humankind , it also contributes to unhealthy behaviors of life , like sedentary lifestyle . 	0
PE	9673	Instead , traditional ways of life is a great complimentary for modern life and highlight the importance of work life balance . 	0
PE	9674	As far as I am concerned , the importance of traditions should be valued and paid attention to . 	1
PE	9675	Traditional skills and lifestyles play important role in modern society , in terms of healthcare , environmental protection and cultural inherit . 	1
PE	9676	Do you agree that the traditional skills will die out ? 	0
PE	9677	With the development of technology , whether or not it is still necessary to protect the traditional skills and lifestyles leads to a drastic controversy which is becoming a public concern , especially considering the significant impact taken by technology . 	0
PE	9678	This new university will allow a great number of people in my community to have a chance to study . 	1
PE	9679	Therefore schools should consider giving several small vocations to the students during the year . 	1
PE	9680	As it not only provide break to them from their regular commitment but also allows them to spend some time on themselves , heel stressful mind and boost desire of resuming to the regular schedule . 	0
PE	9681	For example , suppose you live in a faraway community where there is no single university and you might not want to leave your family . 	0
PE	9682	To quote an instance , in my school we used to get several vacations after our quarterly exams . 	0
PE	9683	It states that students learning capability increase after having refreshing vacation . 	1
PE	9684	Secondly , scientific research provide several authentic survey of the students ' performance after break . 	0
PE	9685	Also several holidays aid these students to not only amuse themselves but also arrange fund and materials such as books and references material for their upcoming course . 	0
PE	9686	Vacations are not only required by students but also by professionals and housekeepers . 	1
PE	9687	If you would like to attend a business school , you have to travel across the country to get to a distant university . 	0
PE	9688	I also used to spend my time on developing some recreational activity or learning some sports or game . 	0
PE	9689	During those vacations i used to analyze my performance in latest examination and used to go through those question or concept again to avoid making same mistakes . 	0
PE	9690	Whether children should start learning a foreign language as they start school or not might be a controversial issue . 	0
PE	9691	He or she definitely can get in the business school in the proposed community ' s university . 	0
PE	9692	It seems to me that students should start learning that as they start school . 	1
PE	9693	Once the animal got sick , professional vet will help them promptly . 	0
PE	9694	Thanks to the considerate care , the diversity of wild animal could be guaranteed . 	0
PE	9695	There is no denying that our environment is damaged day by day due to the fact that excessive pursuit of economic development at expense of eco-system , which pose a great threat to the survival of wild animals . 	0
PE	9696	In contrast , zoo is a good alternative choice for protecting animals as various animals could be better protected by specialized staff . 	1
PE	9697	When it comes to whether zoos should exist on contemporary society , animal-right activists strongly recommended that wildlife belong to natural environment and zoos should be banned . 	0
PE	9698	I would not go along with their viewpoint as zoos have irreplaceable benefits in terms of animal preservation and children education . 	1
PE	9699	Zoos should be banned 	0
PE	9700	Children tend to visit zoos where various kinds of wild creatures could be seen . 	0
PE	9701	Consequently , making their life more complicated and tired . 	0
PE	9702	In addition , games on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers , leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones . 	0
PE	9703	Based on the factors I have mentioned above , a conclusion can be drawn that although technology may make people ' s life complicated in some cases , the convenience it brings in people ' s are significant . 	1
PE	9704	Admittedly , to some extent , technology may make people ' s life more complicated . 	1
PE	9705	With the advent of iPads in e-learning , paper books become unnecessary , so does the blackboards , it is because all the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads , with a single click , and they would appear right before your eyes at once . 	0
PE	9706	Additionally , zoos afford a platform to education teenagers , helping to establish eco-friendly behavior towards animals . 	1
PE	9707	In the zoos , even though wild animals are caged , they have capability to walk in a limited area . 	0
PE	9708	This has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future . 	1
PE	9709	In conclusion , after analysing the effects of world games both for countries at war and for organising countries , it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society , but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness . 	1
PE	9710	As a result , it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events . 	1
PE	9711	This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team . 	0
PE	9712	South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night . 	0
PE	9713	For instance , when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa , its citizens filled up the stadiums , cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field . 	0
PE	9714	Thus , almost of us live in the environment of groups . 	1
PE	9715	After graduating from schools , employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits . 	0
PE	9716	We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life , and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life . 	0
PE	9717	Most of all , the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization , from children to adults . 	1
PE	9718	As university students , it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others . 	0
PE	9719	By making teamwork , the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others . 	0
PE	9720	During our life , it is inevitable that we may be related with any groups or organizations ; therefore , groups and organizations are an important part of their lives . 	0
PE	9721	Why are groups or organizations important to people ? 	0
PE	9722	My reasons include the following : In the first place , humans are a part of the society , and the society includes a wide variety of groups . 	0
PE	9723	In my point of view , groups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals . 	1
PE	9724	Thus , I strongly support the current laws of Great Britain and Australia , and would not change the regulations on keeping the jury unaware of past actions . 	1
PE	9725	More wastes have to be managed . 	0
PE	9726	Maybe crime rate will also increase . 	0
PE	9727	International sporting occasions help to ease international tensions 	0
PE	9728	Traffic may worsen . 	0
PE	9729	However , building the university may lead to some social problems . 	1
PE	9730	For example in FIFA World Cup 2010 , the relation between North Korea and South Korea is dangerous for the warship sinking . 	0
PE	9731	An international sporting event is normal held in a country with huge interest from fans all over the world . 	0
PE	9732	This can also help stimulate the local economy . 	1
PE	9733	The world suspected North Korea of the aggressive action . 	0
PE	9734	However , due to this event North Korea showed a friendship and enthuasism . 	0
PE	9735	These social problems may impair the quality of life in the community . 	0
PE	9736	In sum , I myself agree with the plan to build the university . 	1
PE	9737	As a result , if we don ' t have a good stress management skill , it may lead to some critical problems . 	1
PE	9738	When society had problems , it could impact to a nation . 	0
PE	9739	Thus , government should create campaign to fill love to family . 	1
PE	9740	Lastly , family is a root of society . 	0
PE	9741	If everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other , that family could have problems , If family had problems , it mean society could have problems . 	0
PE	9742	In conclusion , I personally agree with statement that government should spend money on basic people needs . 	1
PE	9743	The basic needs : jobs , good environment , and love in family . 	0
PE	9744	For example , setting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other . 	0
PE	9745	When family understand each other , it mean society and a nation will not have much trouble . 	0
PE	9746	These three issues are the most important basic needs of people in my opinion that government should pay attention on to improve quality life of people . 	1
PE	9747	To boost their sales and win over customers , companies pour a great amount of money into advertising . 	0
PE	9748	Famous people are bothered by the media 	0
PE	9749	Some people think that mass media should only focus on news and current affairs . 	0
PE	9750	Instead , the government and medical foundations should be responsible for the distribution of drugs to the undeveloped world at a more reasonable price . 	0
PE	9751	This issue is a controversial one , but in my opinion a closer examination reveals that mass media deal too much with superficial things for different reasons . 	1
PE	9752	One reason is that television and newspapers focus on famous peoples ' lives in order to increase their audience or readership . 	1
PE	9753	Gutter press and Tabloid TV are more and more replacing quality papers or documentaries programs . 	0
PE	9754	Thanks to the Internet , we can go online and have access to information from all over the world and therefore mass media don ' t need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience . 	0
PE	9755	Another reason is that we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip . 	1
PE	9756	Therefore , the measure cannot be adopted , otherwise those companies will go into liquidation . 	1
PE	9757	In short , this is not a long-term solution . 	0
PE	9758	Moreover , these products prove to ensure human health completely . 	0
PE	9759	Suppose companies were forced to reduce the cost of drugs , they would make no profit , even running up debt because of production expenditure . 	0
PE	9760	Additionally , charitable organizations can buy medicines from developed countries and distribute to the undeveloped world for free . 	0
PE	9761	In conclusion , I disagree with reducing the cost of medicines , which may exacerbate their qualities . 	1
PE	9762	Fortunately , there are other measures to improve the situation . 	1
PE	9763	It is advisable for the government to encourage medical production by supplying land for building factories and reducing part of the taxes . 	0
PE	9764	Most of the time , it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product . 	1
PE	9765	Clearly , although pets aren ' t able to speak with us , we can nonetheless count on them . 	0
PE	9766	Therefore , a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one . 	1
PE	9767	Secondly , police force carries guns only in high crime societies . 	0
PE	9768	Few individuals assume that this trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society . 	1
PE	9769	I totally agree with this viewpoint for some specific reasons which would be given and analyzed in the following paragraphs . 	0
PE	9770	Police force carries guns - significant impact for level of violence 	0
PE	9771	The increasing number of street criminals leading to carrying guns in police force has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today ' s society are very concerned for . 	0
PE	9772	Thus , citizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally . 	0
PE	9773	Moreover , while on duty , not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars , houses , streets are likely to be destroyed by guns . 	0
PE	9774	First of all , we need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself . 	0
PE	9775	As a result , criminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs . 	0
PE	9776	By which I mean , huge cooperation hire celebrities as the face of their product . 	0
PE	9777	Since I was all alone at home for a long time , my dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings . 	0
PE	9778	Some people think that , adults need playing games as children do . 	0
PE	9779	However , in my opinion , games are no longer too important for them for several reasons . 	1
PE	9780	Talking to my friends was frustrating because none of them have ever felt that way . 	0
PE	9781	Parents and even children do not want to communicate with each other instead of watching TV in their own room . 	0
PE	9782	As a consequence , children will learn behavior from what they see on TV not from their parents . 	1
PE	9783	However , have you ever thought that television has destroyed communication among friends and family ? 	0
PE	9784	I personally consider this fact as the harmful thing that television has brought upon us . 	1
PE	9785	Television versus Friends and family 	0
PE	9786	We all know that television provides us many benefits ; it helps people relax , helps keep up with news , helps broad our mind . 	0
PE	9787	Gradually , their friends leave them behind either activities or studying . 	0
PE	9788	Secondly , with the rapid change of the standard of life , each family has three or four TV in each room is more common . 	0
PE	9789	First of all , since people watch television too much , they can be isolated from others . 	1
PE	9790	Children , for example , pay more attention on movies , music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others . 	0
PE	9791	Perhaps , no issue in this world is as significant to people as cooking food , because it affects everybody in their daily lives . 	0
PE	9792	Some people hold the opinion that people should spend much time on food . 	0
PE	9793	Thus , it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future . 	1
PE	9794	And this figure still continuously go up along with the improvement of science and technology . 	0
PE	9795	For example in relationships . 	0
PE	9796	Firstly , people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time , which leads to numerous advantages . 	0
PE	9797	From my personal experience I recall that my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city . 	0
PE	9798	It is said that , surprisingly , he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup because , at least for him , using two different soups properly was quite annoying . 	0
PE	9799	As a result , I could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university-level problems . 	0
PE	9800	Because I was really satisfied with the fact that I could do preferably , I became to absorb myself to try more advanced level of math problems . 	0
PE	9801	That is problem in quality of education . 	0
PE	9802	Lastly , there could lead to a big problem if schools pay teachers by grade that students get . 	0
PE	9803	Then , you will motivate yourself to do more . 	0
PE	9804	To begin with , I agree that sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems . 	1
PE	9805	The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology . 	0
PE	9806	In earlier times , for instance , even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence and as a result they had more outdoor activities . 	0
PE	9807	Nowadays people , especially inhabitants of cities , are spending most of their time on sitting in front of TV or other tools . 	0
PE	9808	Recent medical problems and sedentary lifestyle . 	0
PE	9809	It is certainly true that modern people are facing up to a new health problems and ailments than before . 	1
PE	9810	Many people claim that it is because of sedentary lifestlyle . 	1
PE	9811	However , while I accept that sedentary lifestyle is one of the key factors , I believe that some other factors are having even a greater impact . 	0
PE	9812	Nevertheless , there are some other causes why people are experiencing serious medical problems . 	1
PE	9813	Firstly , the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses . 	0
PE	9814	Just imagine : if a student can ' t even make out whether the source is reasonable or not , then how can he get the right information to help him to learn ? 	0
PE	9815	Because not only do teachers teach us knowledge but also the skills to tell right from wrong . 	1
PE	9816	Students have knowledge of others cultures , outer space etc . Personally , I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source . 	1
PE	9817	For instance , Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes . 	0
PE	9818	Moreover , they contend that good television programs do teach students . 	0
PE	9819	They can only input some key words and google it , and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it . 	0
PE	9820	Those who feel that students learn far more from other sources , such as the Internet and television , firmly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can ' t learn in classes . 	1
PE	9821	In conclusion , fatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child ' s life starting from the the birth due to providing appropriate parenthood and having healthy family relationships . 	1
PE	9822	Therefore , I believe that having and raising children should not be different than any other daily activity . 	0
PE	9823	In conclusion , there is to say that , given the arguments above , living a slower life is advantageous for your health , your happiness and even the quality of your work . 	1
PE	9824	Should the cost of medicines be reduced ? 	0
PE	9825	At present , a large number of patients in poor countries are suffering from deaths caused by lack of medication rather than dangerous diseases . 	0
PE	9826	It is suggested that companies in developed countries ought to reduce their price of medicines to avoid such unnecessary deaths . 	0
PE	9827	Admittedly , more lives will be saved by the use of effective medicines . 	0
PE	9828	The medical industry in developing countries is incapable of producing high-quality drugs . 	0
PE	9829	With advanced technology , the developed world has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in making medicines , which can cure a variety of serious illnesses . 	0
PE	9830	If people in poorer countries gain access to these drugs , their health situations may be better . 	0
PE	9831	The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity . 	1
PE	9832	The centre of research for agriculture can make some research in how to get a good quality of this product , how to treat the Palme and maybe how to treat the land of the palms . 	0
PE	9833	For example , the dates are the most important agriculture product in my country . 	0
PE	9834	The centre of research can raise the market part of this field by developing the agriculture products . 	0
PE	9835	The agriculture field has only thirty percent as a market part . 	0
PE	9836	For me being a developed country does not mean that we have to focus only in business , but we have to focus on what really bring us to the level of self satisfaction , and the agriculture for our country is the field that can realize that . 	0
PE	9837	Some people think that a centre of business research is more important because we have to be in parallel with the advanced countries which have focused in business field . 	1
PE	9838	Obviously , showing people how to exploit a land and get good agriculture products will push people to think about working in the field of agriculture rather than working in business or other field to make money . 	0
PE	9839	Another reason that makes the centre of research for the agriculture more important than the centre of business research is that the first one can create a lot of jobs . 	1
PE	9840	Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground , which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles . 	0
PE	9841	However , in my view , reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies for the following reasons . 	1
PE	9842	So , the government have to invest more for it and encourage people to use . 	0
PE	9843	When we drive a private car , we are alone or only our family members that we already know and lost the opportunity to make friends with others or to see that we are a part of this society . 	0
PE	9844	The use of public transportation make us live more sociable . 	1
PE	9845	Using public transportation has a lot of advantages for the modern society facing a lot of problems : the environmental population , the isolation in life , the depletion of natural resources . 	1
PE	9846	When using public transportation , we have a chance to meet more people and more chances to discovery new aspects of life . 	0
PE	9847	The more cars are driven , the more pollution will be put into air . 	0
PE	9848	They cause pollution and make the Earth warmer . 	0
PE	9849	The atmosphere , surrounding us , will be protected and help us more healthy . 	0
PE	9850	If we use the public transportation , less cars will be used and less pollution will be emitted . 	0
PE	9851	Furthermore , even though some customers do not worry about the threat that second-hand smoke imposes on them , the disgusting smoke will severely affect their appetite , or , in other words , spoil their meals and make them an unpleasant experience . 	1
PE	9852	Therefore , smoking in restaurants should be strictly banned because it makes the restaurant a polluted place which threatens every customer ' s health . 	1
PE	9853	On the other hand , some people maintain that the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system because more pension have to spend for Medicare instead of investing in other sectors of the economic system . 	1
PE	9854	It can be said that the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people . 	1
PE	9855	In facts , young people will be happy as their parents , grandparents are healthy . 	0
PE	9856	In addition , a community with the elderly who have a good health has a major role to play in a sustainable development of a society . 	0
PE	9857	In other words , they do not have to spend more time in health checking or treatment so this saves an amount of time as well as cost . 	0
PE	9858	They can contribute effectively to the development of the economy because healthy workers can create more productivity . 	0
PE	9859	The main advantage of high-tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health . 	1
PE	9860	Although the increase in life expectancy has some pressure on the Medicare system , I am inclined to believe that the advanced medical care brings with it more benefits than disadvantages . 	1
PE	9861	Along with the development of technologies , advanced medical care has played an important role in the improvement of life expectancy . 	0
PE	9862	Improved medical care 	0
PE	9863	Now , it is time to start without any regret from my previous exams . 	0
PE	9864	I can receive some helps from other student as well as improving my learning skills , also managing of time is another achievements of group-studying . 	1
PE	9865	Secondly , reading a novel is more convenient . 	1
PE	9866	Therefore , time management is another brilliant benefit of group-studying . 	1
PE	9867	Group-studying causes some kind of internal obligation to manage the time , inasmuch as we always care about other people and we do not want to waste their time . 	0
PE	9868	When the students study with their friends , they should have schedule to use their time in an effective manner . 	0
PE	9869	Clearly , better learning is one of noticeable result of these competences and encouragements . 	0
PE	9870	Admittedly , technology may have negative effects on children . 	1
PE	9871	Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend . 	0
PE	9872	Professors not only have the knowledge , but also equip with experiences , knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements . 	0
PE	9873	Classes are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students . 	0
PE	9874	First , in terms of learning , attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams . 	1
PE	9875	In my opinion , I believe that students should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is . 	1
PE	9876	These different ideas of learning methods lead to a question whether it is necessary for university students to attend the class as long as they can pass their examinations . 	0
PE	9877	Some students still rely on classes to keep up with the courses , while some students don ' t feel the need to attend classes because they believe that they can handle the exams . 	0
PE	9878	In university education , students are given much independence in the ways of learning . 	0
PE	9879	University students should attend classes or not ? 	0
PE	9880	Attending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves . 	0
PE	9881	Second , it ' s students ' basic responsibility to attend class . 	0
PE	9882	Spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one ' s life 	0
PE	9883	Despite friendship is one of the most important values in a man ' s life , people might have different preferences : some of them prefer to spend time with one or two close friends , while other prefer to be surrounded by a large number of friends . 	1
PE	9884	In my view , I prefer the second attitude . 	0
PE	9885	The first reason is that staying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others ' experiences . 	1
PE	9886	For instance , among a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport , or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before . 	0
PE	9887	Of course , while differences give the opportunity to learn , they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement . 	1
PE	9888	This would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends . 	0
PE	9889	In fact , in this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same . 	0
PE	9890	Another reason is that a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded . 	1
PE	9891	For example , if you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice , your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages . 	0
PE	9892	In my opinion , though competitive children will be far more clever and faster than the co-operative child in an initial level , but it will not help them to be on the success path for the long run ; while on the contrary , co-operative child will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team . 	1
PE	9893	I agree that nowadays the learning process benefits greatly from computers , but they are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human ' s touch . 	0
PE	9894	Secondly , children need human interactions . 	1
PE	9895	However , I do not agree that this explosion in technology will ' innovate ' the education system , by replacing teachers with computers . 	1
PE	9896	There are several reasons why teachers will never be replaced by computers . 	0
PE	9897	There will be soon no role for teachers in classrooms 	0
PE	9898	In recent years it has become more common for teachers to use technological tools in the learning process . 	0
PE	9899	For example , lessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector . 	0
PE	9900	However , scientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching . 	0
PE	9901	Firstly , computers need to be operated by people . 	1
PE	9902	No one can argue that technological tools are must-haves for the classroom of today . 	0
PE	9903	In my view , both can help and each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages . 	1
PE	9904	Scientists try and test many specimens before they get they want . 	0
PE	9905	No known scientist has success in first attempt . 	0
PE	9906	All inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations . 	1
PE	9907	But they slowly tune their technique and learned to walk . 	0
PE	9908	For example , when they tried to learn walking , they stumble and hurt themselves many times . 	0
PE	9909	Every day comes with new challenges for them like walking , eating , etc . , but those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life . 	1
PE	9910	The best example of it is how babies learn about basics survival habits during their childhood . 	0
PE	9911	My opinion based on the reasons that Every tough experience makes us more skilled , improves our decision making and makes us more compatible for life . 	1
PE	9912	I agree with the statement that our life seems tough at the time but those difficult experiences of life become important lessons for the future . 	0
PE	9913	Every experience always gives us something to learn and keep for life 	0
PE	9914	We have no choice but have to live in a fast pace . 	0
PE	9915	In conclusion , while there some people live in a pretty good condition , it is only a minority . 	1
PE	9916	Today , we are able to read the news all over the world , to chat with people through the Internet , or to travel around the world by planes ; however , it also means that any thing happens in the world will affect our life . 	0
PE	9917	If we cannot react properly and immediately , then we will be in a vulnerable situation . 	0
PE	9918	Thus , the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today . 	1
PE	9919	The third reason is that the pace of life . 	1
PE	9920	Everyday , I walk on hard roads , breath in polluted air , and live in a limited space . 	0
PE	9921	What ' s worse , it has been proved that living in this kind of condition will result in some mental diseases . 	0
PE	9922	Second , the environment today is serious damaged . 	0
PE	9923	Looking out the windows , what I see isn ' t sky , trees or mountains , but is coldly high buildings . 	0
PE	9924	Some people who send their children to private schools contend that the amount of taxes they pay for the state education is unreasonable . 	0
PE	9925	The tax reduction of state school for parents who have children studying in private system 	0
PE	9926	Firstly , by paying taxes for public school , affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor . 	1
PE	9927	However , I am utterly convinced that these taxes are absolutely essential . 	1
PE	9928	With the the tax amount for which they pay , the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies , and earn a better quality of life . 	0
PE	9929	It is true that many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course . 	0
PE	9930	Obviously , this reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation ; therefore , the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue . 	0
PE	9931	Secondly , the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital . 	1
PE	9932	Many parents supporting for the idea of tax discounts claim that such tax payments are unfair for them . 	1
PE	9933	In addition , the government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials , and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care . 	0
PE	9934	If people are equipped with a single international language , they can tell each other smoothly about their countries ' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles , which enables people to expand their outlooks , viewing the world in new angles . 	0
PE	9935	For example , when people travel to foreign countries , the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language , helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience . 	0
PE	9936	Learning English can foster people ' s sentiment and nourish their literature and art . 	0
PE	9937	In addition , English is a beautiful language , which is more systematical and extensive than many other languages . 	0
PE	9938	With the development of globalization , English became the dominated language in national trade , conference and many important events . 	0
PE	9939	Advantages and disadvantages of the prevalent of English 	0
PE	9940	Some people claim that the prevalent of English brings a great number of benefits for people . 	1
PE	9941	This phenomenon has aroused a heated discussion in public . 	0
PE	9942	In the ancient time , the different languages and geography set barriers for people to exchange their goods and ideas . 	0
PE	9943	First of all , it promotes the communication and interaction between different countries more conveniently and clearly . 	0
PE	9944	If we can popularize the use of English , the language hinder will disappear as well . 	0
PE	9945	Fortunately , the innovation of plane and train solved the geographical barriers . 	0
PE	9946	In other words , if you can ' t take any criticism , not only will you fail in cooperating with other people , but also get defeated in personal works . 	0
PE	9947	As one Chinese idiom goes : " The good medicine tastes bitter “ . 	0
PE	9948	However , criticism can help you detect those drawbacks and fix them if you are willing to take it . 	0
PE	9949	Those who don ' t even take a word of criticism will eventually lose chances to get improved . 	0
PE	9950	Even if you are not working in a group , you still need to take others ' criticism . 	1
PE	9951	Criticism definitely hurts because it points out your drawbacks and forces you to confront them . 	0
PE	9952	It ' s every member ' s duty to respect other ' s opinion . 	0
PE	9953	Second , taking criticism is a virtue as you take someone ' s opinion that is against you . 	0
PE	9954	Criticism might be the most powerful solution to heal . 	0
PE	9955	However , some people might ask : what if the criticism proves to be wrong ? 	0
PE	9956	Secondly , professional lives are filled with tasks that is neccessary parts of the jobs . 	1
PE	9957	Nobody likes attending boring conferences , or working a person who isn ' t well in with anyone . 	0
PE	9958	I ' m a research asistant at a university , and as any of the univesity in ours we have a professor who isn ' t good at human relationships , most of the asistans don ' t enjoy to talk with him about any situation , although we have to ask about his field . 	0
PE	9959	Thirdly , doing something which an individual doesn ' t enjoy can led to enjoyment . 	1
PE	9960	People sometimes can attend any activities by insisting on any of their friends although they don ' t really want . 	0
PE	9961	For example , one of our friends tell my husband and me about a dance course which we both don ' t like . 	0
PE	9962	After insisting on some of our friends , we attended , and got really enjoyable time , we continued the course about six months although most of our friends left the course after a month . 	0
PE	9963	Nobody has a life with a lot of fun ; there are sometimes unpleasant and boring parts which is not liked by anyone , but most of them are about responsibilities which is the part of individual ' s live . 	1
PE	9964	Besides , dancing could show how civilization of that culture is . 	0
PE	9965	Moreover , people use dancing to entertain themselves . 	0
PE	9966	So dancing is important in every culture . 	1
PE	9967	This may confuse children who should not choose their future job because of the influence of the mass media , but from the basis of their own interests . 	0
PE	9968	In conclusion , parents should be more worried about their children ' s attitudes to the ' cult of celebrity ' . 	1
PE	9969	As recent surveys showed , inspired by the fame and wealth , children now prefer more to become an actor / actress or a sports star than it was in the past . 	0
PE	9970	Many schools for preparation of so-called stars and various advertisements about famous people may mislead with the fact that this profession is highly required and easy reachable . 	0
PE	9971	They should teach their children how to distinguish shortcoming stars from truly talented ones and to put right priorities in life . 	0
PE	9972	Mobile phones , such as smart phones , has made our communication easy and convenience . 	0
PE	9973	However , we may perceive this issue from different viewpoints . 	0
PE	9974	Thus , mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication . 	1
PE	9975	The reason is that , as most of the telecommunication companies provide us with access to the internet via our phones , people are able to enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls free of charge . 	0
PE	9976	Therefore , i highly advocate that we should use mobile phone in moderation in order to avoid these serious problems . 	0
PE	9977	To sum up , although mobile phones make our communication faster , it also gives rise to many social problems such as children ' s social skills and their mental health . 	1
PE	9978	Therefore , even when we grow older , get married and then have our own families with spouses and children , parents always keep watching us and help us to realize which is right and which is wrong in life . 	1
PE	9979	On the other hand , it is possible for ordinary people to participate in some actions of environment protection , and they also can benefit from the improvement of environment . 	1
PE	9980	For instance , many people driving private cars could cause air pollution , and overusing plastic packages would affect the environment . 	0
PE	9981	If people can gradually change some lifestyles in these daily activities , this will have many significant impacts on environmental improvement . 	0
PE	9982	In conclusion , the government and corporations should take more responsibility for addressing environmental issues , but every citizen also can contribute to the environment . 	1
PE	9983	Therefore , with the advent of internet and online paying systems , you can do many thing at your home easily . 	1
PE	9984	Not only with the help of sending email , but also using credit cards to pay all necessary fees online . 	0
PE	9985	But nowadays , all people can take advantage of internet to have their own email free , and send their emails to everyone in no time , besides they can be sure if their emails have been delivered or not . 	0
PE	9986	Many years ago , peoples had to pay a great deal of money to post their letters , and their payements were related to the weight of their letters or boxes , and many accidents may cause problem that the post could not be delivered . 	0
PE	9987	Today , students can apply for foreign universities much easier than before . 	0
PE	9988	Another important aspect on technology is transferring money . 	0
PE	9989	Nowadays , everyone can see the effect of technology on their life , especially on the way of transportations and communications such as the airplane and the telephone . 	0
PE	9990	Advance in transportation and communication like the airplane and the phone 	0
PE	9991	First and foremost , email can be count as one of the most beneficial results of modern technology . 	1
PE	9992	There are lots of other effects of growing technology on transportations and communications , which are mentioned as follows . 	0
PE	9993	However , some people think it ' s not a good educational measure . 	0
PE	9994	Their parents allow them to take some jobs because these jobs can help them learn and take responsibilities . 	0
PE	9995	In conclusion , although we cannot deny machines are play a vital role in people living and working , problems posed by machines should draws more attentions as well . 	1
PE	9996	Children engagement in paid work 	0
PE	9997	Therefore , they are likely to understand their parents ' hardship , to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving . 	1
PE	9998	Especially in large population countries , high unemployment rate may cause crime and social instability . 	0
PE	9999	First of all , children can learn about the hardship of earning money . 	0
PE	10000	From my point of view , the benefits of children engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks . 	1
PE	10001	To keep their jobs , children will have to try their best to finish their duties . 	0
PE	10002	Secondly , when children take jobs , they tend to be more responsible because whether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working . 	1
PE	10003	Higher education should be available only to good students or not 	0
PE	10004	No one can disagree that knowledge is the most important for everyone . 	0
PE	10005	College and university are playing in an important role to provide academic skills to people in order to pursue their goal . 	0
PE	10006	There are an issue that some people agree that this opportunity should be preserved for good students however there are others people who think that everyone should have this chance to gain these advance skills from college or university . 	0
PE	10007	This issue will be discussed . 	0
PE	10008	First of all , many people think that college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students . 	1
PE	10009	The reason is that studying in advance education take a huge of money . 	0
PE	10010	College and university do not want people who not qualify for to waste their money in these expensive courses and waste their time . 	0
PE	10011	They believe that only good students have potentials to success programs more that those who are not considered as good students . 	0
PE	10012	Consequently , mediocre students are not have a chance to gain these advance knowledge from college and university . 	0
PE	10013	On the other hand , studying hard will give children a better future . 	1
PE	10014	Studying hard gives children with a plenty of knowledge and skills for their future . 	0
PE	10015	Some people believe that studying hard is essential part for children , otherwise others people think that playing sport is waste of time . 	0
PE	10016	In my point of view , both of studying hard and playing sports are part of life to children . 	1
PE	10017	Children should studying hard or playing sport ? 	0
PE	10018	Both can improve their future 	0
PE	10019	Secondly , at school we study bigger things about sciences and languages , but after school we learn from our parents . 	0
PE	10020	In my opinion , we spend most of our time at home with our families than it at school . 	0
PE	10021	As we were born , parents taught us from the very little things such as how to smile , how to walk to the ordinary routines such as eating . 	0
PE	10022	Moreover , when we grow bigger , they teach us many fairy tales and several important ethic lessons that affect us till the end of our lives . 	0
PE	10023	I whole-heartedly agree with this opinion because of these following reasons . 	0
PE	10024	Firstly , parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life . 	1
PE	10025	Getting the best lessons , besides our abilities to self-study , depends on our teachers a lot . 	0
PE	10026	There are people who believe that no one else is better than our parents in terms of teachers . 	1
PE	10027	Parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life 	0
PE	10028	Learning is a thing that we do in all of our lives . 	0
PE	10029	Moreover , the increasing taking advantage of advanced equipment could make students be lazier and more subjective in their writing skills . 	0
PE	10030	For example , with the assistance of automatic grammar and spelling checking in office word , learners are now no need for noticing much in their mistakes . 	0
PE	10031	The fact is that kids who are bad at handwriting meet difficulties in taking notes and catching up lessons . 	0
PE	10032	It resulted in the missing of information and the lack of details during their works . 	0
PE	10033	To conclude , no matter how fast and convenient modern devices bring to us in writing , handwriting is still a needed skill for all of people , especially students at the early age . 	1
PE	10034	Thus , the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation . 	0
PE	10035	When you ' re doing something well , you will feel more satisfied and more interested in it . 	0
PE	10036	If you keep doing what you already do well , you can be better good at it . 	0
PE	10037	As the example above indicates , you will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well . 	1
PE	10038	Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances because they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle . 	1
PE	10039	Nowadays the automobile is one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday life . 	0
PE	10040	People are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time 	0
PE	10041	Generally speaking , I definitely agree with the statement that cars have improved modern life , for several reasons . 	1
PE	10042	Many people own cars and use them daily , which clearly shows how important they are . 	0
PE	10043	In summary , doing what you can already do well helps you make a big accomplishment and do it much better . 	1
PE	10044	Thus , by doing what you are good at , you will be better at it . 	1
PE	10045	Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today . 	0
PE	10046	I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away . 	0
PE	10047	Telephones and email make me feel personal because I could directly connect with people that I love . 	1
PE	10048	Thus , these types of communications make me feel personal . 	0
PE	10049	As a result , I believe that telephones and email do not make communication between people less personal . 	1
PE	10050	Beside , I could express my personal thought through telephones and email . 	0
PE	10051	Second , using telephones and email could express some important words better than face-to-face communication . 	1
PE	10052	Telephones and email made me feel close to my parents . 	0
PE	10053	So , when I have a time to realize what had happened , I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion . 	0
PE	10054	For instant , sometime when I argue with my friends , I cannot express my self to my friends at that moment . 	0
PE	10055	Some people believe that strictly and carefully presenting theories in the class is the best way of teaching , while others assert that involving applications on that theory will be more convincing . 	0
PE	10056	In my opinion , I agree with the second idea that the best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school . 	1
PE	10057	How teachers can make the subject interesting to students ! 	0
PE	10058	Some people would rather watch TV . 	0
PE	10059	Together , they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays . 	0
PE	10060	Reading fictions is more pleasant 	0
PE	10061	There are many different opinions regarding hobbies . 	0
PE	10062	Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels , where each scene is happening . 	0
PE	10063	For example , after I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution , I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people . 	0
PE	10064	Firstly , fiction books pay more attention to details . 	1
PE	10065	In fact , we can know characters , places , and times of a novel very well during reading it . 	0
PE	10066	Way to reduce the amount of traffic ? 	0
PE	10067	Big cities nowadays can be described as melting pots . 	0
PE	10068	The problem off traffic overload , caused by overpopulation , has aroused interest of many city planners . 	0
PE	10069	It is argued that only if the demand to go out on the street is cut down can we solve the seemingly insurmountable issue of traffic gridlock . 	0
PE	10070	However , I have to profoundly disagree for there are still two viable solutions besides besides this way . 	0
PE	10071	First of all , public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street . 	1
PE	10072	Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options . 	0
PE	10073	Apparently , a bus can carry no less than 30 people , while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number . 	0
PE	10074	First of all , by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life , students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject . 	1
PE	10075	Take chemistry for example , merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring , while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class . 	0
PE	10076	Moreover , in a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits . 	0
PE	10077	Regardless of some exceptions , it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities . 	1
PE	10078	University education is always an important part of one ' s life . 	0
PE	10079	Living in smal towns 	0
PE	10080	Place of living has the most significant affect on our lives and we have to choose it according to several factors . 	0
PE	10081	Some people prefer to live in tall buildings and crowded areas , whereas others prefer to live in a small and calm town . 	0
PE	10082	I would prefer to live in a small town and I think a small town has some advantages , such as good weather , a healthy life and better facilities . 	1
PE	10083	Firstly , the first advantage of living in a small town is a healthy life that we can obtain due to many items . 	0
PE	10084	One of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town . 	0
PE	10085	Also , in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic . 	0
PE	10086	Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness . 	0
PE	10087	Hence , this type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature . 	0
PE	10088	To sum up , art is a very valuable object for every country and the talent in this area cannot be discovered everywhere , so I think governments should help and encourage artists to continue their work . 	1
PE	10089	Another reason why artists should be helped is because talent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted . 	1
PE	10090	Indeed , not many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts . 	0
PE	10091	Consequently , frequent conflicts may occur during communication . 	0
PE	10092	In these games , children are rewarded to help their characters to kill or shoot monsters or characters controlled by other players , and this many lead to development of aggressive feelings , thoughts and behaviors . 	0
PE	10093	Taking into account of all these factors , we may reach the conclusion that training can be effective in encouraging further good work . 	1
PE	10094	Training can help employees refresh their mind as well as make them happy , focus on work . 	0
PE	10095	In conclusion , providing professional training as a reward for good work has many advantages . 	1
PE	10096	Of course , excellent working result will make them very happy as well as their boss . 	0
PE	10097	Having professional training help employees gain more confidence in their business , so I believe that they will finish their jobs with excellent result . 	0
PE	10098	Thirdly , providing training will make employees happy with their current job because it help them improve their professional business knowledge . 	1
PE	10099	At this circumstances , they would surf on the internet for hours and end up no where . 	0
PE	10100	As searching information on the internet , young people are probably distracted by other attractions such as online games or social webs . 	0
PE	10101	Nevertheless , this ability is also essential for young people since young people can overcome their bad habits and fulfill their goals more quickly with this ability . 	0
PE	10102	Thus , it is not need for young people to possess this ability . 	1
PE	10103	Finally , some assert that the ability to plan and organize can be learned until obtaining a job . 	0
PE	10104	Every employee can not afford this kind of loss . 	0
PE	10105	In this case , those employees who did not plan and finish their assignments ahead of time perhaps are unable to finish these tasks on time and therefore will be penalized or get fired . 	0
PE	10106	For instance , the deadline of task is shifted to an earlier date for the change of company ' s schedule . 	0
PE	10107	However , things have been changing all the time . 	0
PE	10108	If some employees lack the ability to plan and organize ahead , they may get the procrastination and therefore take into action until the deadline is imminent . 	0
PE	10109	They can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice . 	0
PE	10110	I still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor ' s research project . 	0
PE	10111	They are able to observe animals ' behaviors and features . 	0
PE	10112	The zoo also let students have a chance to learning biology practically . 	0
PE	10113	Besides , researchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches because it has diverse species of animals . 	0
PE	10114	Moreover , practical learning help students relax from a boring lecture class . 	0
PE	10115	In the zoo , there is not so harmful as a forest . 	0
PE	10116	Secondly , the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats . 	1
PE	10117	Furthermore , we can do artificial insemenation to maintain nearly extinct wildlife . 	0
PE	10118	They , fed by zookeepers , do not need to find food themselves . 	0
PE	10119	And finally , there is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e-mail . 	1
PE	10120	When you speak face-to-face you are not as able to control every word as you are when you write an e-mail . 	0
PE	10121	For example , you can change the word order or you can choose more appropriate style to sound more polite . 	0
PE	10122	Thirdly , when you write an e-mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself . 	1
PE	10123	To sum up , I would like to say that for me both options of communicating are possible , but if this is an important and not urgent question I would prefer to answer it by means of internet or voice mail . 	1
PE	10124	You should not worry about interrupting an important conversation or some other business . 	0
PE	10125	In a few years I will finish my studying in the university and I will have to decide whether to live in a small town or a big city . 	0
PE	10126	Small town vs . Big city ( opportunities , entertainment , job places ) 	0
PE	10127	Big city life provides many opportunities . 	0
PE	10128	As I am eager to get a good job and explore different places , I think I would prefer to live in a city . 	1
PE	10129	Electrical engineering deals with problems concerning electricity supply . 	0
PE	10130	First of all , it will be easier for me to find an engineering job in the city . 	0
PE	10131	At the weekends , there is a great number of things to do in the metropolis . 	1
PE	10132	Therefore , a big city can offer me many more vacancies than a small town . 	1
PE	10133	Multinational cities have restaurants with different national cuisines . 	0
PE	10134	There are numerous bars , cafes and restaurants where I can go with my friends . 	0
PE	10135	I have tried to correct him for couple times but he just thinks that I am too conservative . 	0
PE	10136	Furthermore , they are most likely to quarrel every day , instead of to help each other . 	0
PE	10137	Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident . 	0
PE	10138	Last but not least , every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time . 	0
PE	10139	Therefore , e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out . 	0
PE	10140	For instance , I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior , it ' s hard for me to face her and explain what she should do . 	0
PE	10141	I don ' t have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive . 	0
PE	10142	She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed . 	0
PE	10143	In addition , writing e-mail helps people express honestly . 	1
PE	10144	Moreover , e-mail doesn ' t take too much time : just a click . 	0
PE	10145	Sometimes , their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect . 	0
PE	10146	Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid . 	0
PE	10147	If someone exchange my friends with thousands of acquaintances , I will definitely say NO . 	0
PE	10148	If I could decide I would chose living in the city for sure . 	0
PE	10149	Today living in the rural places is in most causes connected with agrarian lifestyle , which for me is without perspective . 	0
PE	10150	Taking all into account , I think that living in the city is much better nowadays , because of the opportunities it gives . 	1
PE	10151	Moreover , peaceful and close to the nature areas could help to avoid worries and sadness . 	0
PE	10152	However , in the countryside there are many places to rest , because of its location . 	1
PE	10153	The buses and trains are more frequent than in the countryside , so the city provides better communication . 	1
PE	10154	This truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues . 	0
PE	10155	If I worked in the different field from my father , I would have faced much difficulty than I do now . 	0
PE	10156	Also , they do not have to educate and they do not have to work , so they have a lot of time in their hand to enjoy this stage of their life . 	1
PE	10157	In addition , in this age they are not expected to be responsible . 	1
PE	10158	As much as their events might were bitter , in their adulthood they are sweet . 	0
PE	10159	When individuals reminisce their memories they absolutely infer to some of their childhood events . 	0
PE	10160	You hardly ever can find a person who says that he or she had unpleasant childhood . 	0
PE	10161	Children are free 	0
PE	10162	Therefore there is no argument and punishment for them . 	1
PE	10163	Because they are in the age of growth and they are allowed whatever they want to do to experience new stuffs . 	0
PE	10164	In the first place , children are free whatever they want to do , they are not restricted and their limitation are really rare . 	0
PE	10165	In my opinion , childhood is definitely the happiest time of people life in two main areas . 	1
PE	10166	Choosing the job that is similar to parents ' jobs could benefit to one ' s career 	0
PE	10167	When choosing a job , one need to consider it thoroughly . 	0
PE	10168	So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information , rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers ' taste . 	1
PE	10169	In conclusion , the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources . 	1
PE	10170	It would be helpful , however , if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures . 	0
PE	10171	For example , electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years . 	0
PE	10172	With people raising their awareness of the green economy , the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients , which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today , triggering sales . 	0
PE	10173	If a firm is environmentally conscious , it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment , which can boost productivity . 	0
PE	10174	Furthermore , taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies . 	1
PE	10175	On the other hand , without the requirement of environmental preservation , the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs , being a hurdle to the economic development . 	0
PE	10176	Therefore , it may spur its economic development . 	0
PE	10177	On the other hand , I suppose the developed countries should support the underdeveloped areas by providing financial resources , technologies and experience so that the environmental problems can be effectively alleviated in these areas . 	0
PE	10178	Therefore , I would conclude that thriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously . 	1
PE	10179	Not only that , as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance , they will less likely steal from the shops . 	0
PE	10180	To illustrate this further , in Malaysia , policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight . 	0
PE	10181	Today , close circuit television ( CCTV ) cameras are widely used in a variety of circumstances . 	0
PE	10182	Use of CCTV cameras 	0
PE	10183	It is undeniable that the use of CCTV has plenty of benefits to offer , especially in reducing crimes and protecting the employees in a premise . 	0
PE	10184	They are used in schools , businesses and some other premises in order to monitor the activities taking place . 	0
PE	10185	Even so , I strongly believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace . 	1
PE	10186	Nevertheless , some argue that these cameras invade their privacies due to constantly being monitored . 	0
PE	10187	This is because when a shop is attacked by thieves , the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced . 	0
PE	10188	Firstly , by having CCTV cameras at workplace , crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down . 	0
PE	10189	There are a lot of tourists who seek to see those animals closely . 	0
PE	10190	Last but not least , because of all weird , acute , and beautiful animals in the zoo , it can be a great tourist attraction . 	0
PE	10191	Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers . 	0
PE	10192	Tax revenue is collected from those who works . 	0
PE	10193	Besides , high school must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum . 	0
PE	10194	Besides , there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure , such as health care service and education , so addressing unemployment should have low priority . 	0
PE	10195	Unemployment is clearly a global problem , be it in developed countries or developing ones . 	0
PE	10196	Should governments be responsible to help the unemployed and homeless 	0
PE	10197	Government money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only . 	1
PE	10198	However , I tend to believe it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens , rather than the government , to help them out . 	1
PE	10199	Of course , this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance . 	1
PE	10200	If they could get free financial help from the government , they might end up with out any motivation to work at all . 	0
PE	10201	To sum up both contentions about the necessity of universities ' education have reasonable justifications ; however , I agree with the latter view . 	0
PE	10202	Although higher education does not guarantee young students ' success , the benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges . 	1
PE	10203	More importantly , many researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society . 	0
PE	10204	Another significant factor of universities is that diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently because there are a number of chances through internships , deeper discussion , independent life , and exchange scholarships . 	0
PE	10205	It is my belief the tendency of getting extra jobs will increase more in the future . 	0
PE	10206	Lastly , doing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation . 	1
PE	10207	Indeed , high studying tuition , added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students . 	0
PE	10208	By constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation , then students ' confidence could be significantly gained . 	0
PE	10209	Also , working conditions require students the independency in thinking , working , and solving problems , which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities . 	0
PE	10210	In conclusion , I feel certain that having a part time job during your student time will offer students many clear benefits . 	1
PE	10211	By taking on an extra job , students can partly alleviate some their problematic matters such as working experience , confidence and accommodation . 	1
PE	10212	With the money they earn from extra jobs , which normally is not much , those difficulties could be partially solved . 	0
PE	10213	Moreover , that helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well-prepared condition for their independent later life . 	1
PE	10214	On the next day , we played together and she introduced me to her friends . 	0
PE	10215	Thanks to her and outdoor activities such as going skiing , climbing the mountain , I had a lot of friends since The National Camp . 	0
PE	10216	I belive that practicing these sports helped me greatly . 	0
PE	10217	Something else that is good is that playing these sports is to keep my body fit , make me ultimately refreshed . 	0
PE	10218	After that summer , my body is stronger and endurance is better . 	0
PE	10219	Outdoor activities not only improves my health but also gives me chances to communicate with more people . 	1
PE	10220	When I was ten years old , I was a shy girl . 	0
PE	10221	My mother took me to The National Camp . 	0
PE	10222	At first , I just ate and played alone . 	0
PE	10223	But on the third day , while I was swimming , a friendly girl came and greeted me , we became friend later and she taught me how to swim effectively . 	0
PE	10224	And I believe my friend will do the same to me . 	0
PE	10225	This way of writing will encourage them to pay more attention on content , elaborate in details and develop their organization abilities . 	0
PE	10226	Secondly , parents and schools should give priority on directing their kids about handwriting as poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students ' school performance . 	1
PE	10227	So this example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects . 	0
PE	10228	On other side of the coin , many people believe that usage of machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing similar amount of work . 	0
PE	10229	Take the example of use of food processors in kitchens . 	0
PE	10230	The work of chopping , blending , grating , kneading has become so easy that people can not imagine their lives without this simple machine at their homes . 	0
PE	10231	Thus it is very obvious that using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome . 	1
PE	10232	After analyzing these two points of view , it is believed that using machines is advantageous as machines make work easy and smooth . 	1
PE	10233	The negative effects on health can be put on the back seat because there are many other ways to exercise and stay healthy . 	1
PE	10234	Therefore , it is hoped that in coming time people will enjoy using more and more machines and will choose alternative ways to stay disease free . 	0
PE	10235	The message is when you always studying harder than others you will get best results . 	0
PE	10236	As a rule of thumb , huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities . 	0
PE	10237	The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people . 	1
PE	10238	Second , rarely do we realize the helpful existence of urban areas . 	0
PE	10239	It is believed that if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt , the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now . 	0
PE	10240	In conclusion , city planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas . 	1
PE	10241	It is highly recommended to put forward such solution , especially in some developing countries like Vietnam or China , with the ever-growing demand for job or education . 	0
PE	10242	Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose , most of them are attracted by facebook , blog , etc . instead . 	0
PE	10243	Due to this neglect , they will have a bad result in school because when they can not live without internet , they will have no time for their studying . 	0
PE	10244	In conclusion , although it is undeniable that computer is a crucial part of human life , it still has its bad side , especially for children . 	1
PE	10245	People should learn how to use it properly to make it an effective tool because computer should be used not only for entertaining but also for working and studying purpose . 	0
PE	10246	Internet facilities such as msn , skype made visual communication possible . 	0
PE	10247	For example , via skype people not just communicate with their family members and friends , but also make interviews for employment , enrolment into universities . 	0
PE	10248	With the use of email our messages can be delivered to any person in any part of the world in few minutes . 	0
PE	10249	In addition , it is convenient because you do not need to mile to the post office , but just click the mouse of your computer from the convenience of your arm chair in order to reach your friends , family members in any part of the world . 	0
PE	10250	In result , communication has become cheaper , faster and visual . 	1
PE	10251	Finally , I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient in the ways that it broadened the sources of information and made access more quick , a long with the improving quality of the communication in many ways . 	1
PE	10252	Because in classroom have many equipment to demonstrate real example . 	0
PE	10253	To begin with , learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt . 	1
PE	10254	I will give reasons to support my opinion . 	0
PE	10255	Consequently , I completely disagree with this statement that we should replace normal course with online course . 	1
PE	10256	Besides , learning in classroom are not only learning academic skills but also learning social skills , and learning how to solve problem in real situation . 	0
PE	10257	Learning in classroom could provide more information to study . 	0
PE	10258	Should replace normal classroom with online computer classes ? 	0
PE	10259	In conclusion , the needs for having developed-skills and gaining degree certificate in order to build someone ' s career are totally needed to implement and applied for any gender . 	1
PE	10260	Those standard jobs will always be available for everyone , while complex ones should be only handled by the best people , who start their career from the best institutions . 	0
PE	10261	To sum thing up , I agree that everyone should have a compulsory education level up to high school , but the above divisions should be only the realm of the best students . 	1
PE	10262	Ultimately , this improves the overall quality of education and gives the best people to serve in the most necessary needs of the society . 	0
PE	10263	Another reason is order to gaining higher education degree as it is required to establish a person ' s career . 	0
PE	10264	These days , it is so hard for young people to get a proper job when they have not degree certificate from Universities . 	0
PE	10265	So , learning from human ' s history , education provides someone to widen his or her knowledge and experience for facing the real situation of workplace through subject taught in college . 	0
PE	10266	According to this opinion , giving equal education for both men and women is a must . 	1
PE	10267	I totally agree that using of these soft devices have cut much of time people need to see with their relatives . 	1
PE	10268	However , it is had some demerits on their social lives . 	1
PE	10269	Modern forms of communication ; ' electronic letter ' 	0
PE	10270	Undoubtedly , the movement of modern forms of communication has changed better , which help people to interact to others , such as email and messaging without limitation time . 	0
PE	10271	Another perspective , using of these facilities has influenced netizens to keep themselves becoming unsociable . 	0
PE	10272	It caused they were swept away by virtual atmosphere , so they do not do much social live interactions with others . 	0
PE	10273	Mentioned to societies life style , they constantly use these kinds of electronic letter for making fellowship or just continuing theirs what they already had . 	0
PE	10274	Obviousness , there are other ways like social media that they could to use it for meeting theirs buddies such as Twitter and Facebook , also make the communication become feasible and limitless of time . 	1
PE	10275	The consequence of this case made some people become geek , as too much of using email and messaging , without direct contacts . 	1
PE	10276	However , people have had own minded to keep connection with their friends as a good relationship , meet them and talk by face to face directly . 	0
PE	10277	This is because they are doing what they love , their income however seems to be quite low compared to many other career paths . 	0
PE	10278	It is obvious that people who are woking in art or painting industries , for example , will find it quite difficult to live comfortably and enjoyably . 	0
PE	10279	More specifically , people tend to choose high salary jobs so as to not only help themselves but also support partially or wholly their family ' s living needs such as food , clothes , accommodation , education , medication . 	1
PE	10280	On one hand , i agree that money is very essential in order to meet human ' basic needs . 	0
PE	10281	In the following paragraphs , some of my viewpoints would be given and analyzed respectively . 	0
PE	10282	I personally suppose that there are still many other aspects which should be seen as important as income when people choose a job . 	1
PE	10283	Along with the increasing physical demands of human life , salary has become the most influential consideration in defining careers of everyone . 	0
PE	10284	Salary is the most important consideration when choosing a job 	0
PE	10285	There are plenty of people , who are now really successful , have started working in challenging as well as competitive fields as singers , dancers and painters . 	0
PE	10286	On the other hand , i believe that if we are passionate about what we are working , we are likely to achieve success easily in that field . 	1
PE	10287	Moreover , after taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents . 	0
PE	10288	As you can see , part time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially . 	0
PE	10289	In sum , I am sure ; some people will oppose the idea of part time job for students . 	0
PE	10290	They will argue , it can destruct students from their study . 	1
PE	10291	However , as i did part time job in my high school and it did not hurt my academic result ; therefore , i believe part time job will be good for students . 	1
PE	10292	Every Student should do part time job beside their study if they want to prepare more efficiently for their future . 	0
PE	10293	Consequently , dancing are the part of people belief . 	1
PE	10294	Or some part of the world that are in arid area believe that if they danced , the rain would come . 	0
PE	10295	Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxid into environment that cause the Earth to heat up . 	0
PE	10296	However , the biggest concern is the effect on global warming . 	0
PE	10297	In conclusion , I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits . 	1
PE	10298	In fact , while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories , nothing is being done to reins the airlines . 	0
PE	10299	Instead , people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices . 	0
PE	10300	However , it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive . 	0
PE	10301	Many cultures do dance to show a great prosperous of its culture . 	0
PE	10302	Dancing is also one of important parts of culture that represent to something that people believe . 	0
PE	10303	In any case , a musician playing " I swear " several times receives different earnings that Padang got because the musician re-plays the song without any creation . 	0
PE	10304	Striking contrast , labor working in the merchandise factory receive coin of dollar even they make a hundred of 15 cm Buddha temples a day . 	0
PE	10305	He granted huge sums for such idea . 	0
PE	10306	Pieter Padang , Minion creator , has brilliant idea to alter part of song lyric " I swear " become " underwear " when the Minion sing in Despicable Me . 	0
PE	10307	I agree that government cannot take steps to make the salary between modern artists and other job similar because art price is about taste . 	1
PE	10308	Having said that the huge sums of modern artists receives related to their struggle in the field of art , while the term of struggle might different with other field of job . 	1
PE	10309	Moreover , government cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist because there is no certain parameter to value it , art value is about taste . 	1
PE	10310	To conclude , CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise . 	1
PE	10311	This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers . 	1
PE	10312	Admittedly , privacies are lost with the use of these cameras . 	0
PE	10313	Nonetheless , safety should be put first in order to be safe . 	0
PE	10314	In my point of view , though competitive child would have more motivation and perspective that leads them to success , but it would not help them much once they enter to society or company which required more about skill of team work . 	1
PE	10315	For example , famous singers or movie stars , despite of their talent to make them successful , there are always a team to manage works or deal with things . 	0
PE	10316	To sum up , I would say that schools and adults should put a sense of cooperation in children to make them becoming a useful adult whether in society or community . 	1
PE	10317	To give a brief conclusion , Modern technogy has impacted the traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways . 	1
PE	10318	Modern devices also assist the scientists to study the ancient societies much more deeply , hence discovering more cultural traces . 	0
PE	10319	With the help of advanced methods , many art masterpiece has been well restorated and well preserved . 	0
PE	10320	Individuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends , which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes . 	0
PE	10321	Despite this , it is undeniable that following fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals ' personalities . 	0
PE	10322	With those arguments in mind , I would conclude that people should , especially for ones lacking basic aesthetic knowledge , care more about fashion trends in lives as they can keep pace with the world ' s changes . 	1
PE	10323	Consequently , the world would look monotonous . 	1
PE	10324	On the other hand , creative design talents can value their own dressing ideas , developing their own fashion styles as they like . 	1
PE	10325	Many animals today are in danger of extinction owing to various reasons . 	0
PE	10326	Protect animals or not ? 	0
PE	10327	In my opinion , we should give priority to our own issues . 	1
PE	10328	While some people believe it is important to protect these endangered species , others argue that problems of human beings deserve more attention . 	0
PE	10329	If certain species are absent from this system , such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species , including human beings , will come under threat . 	0
PE	10330	Animal protectionists may base their argument on the ground that biodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem . 	0
PE	10331	However , I think species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution . 	1
PE	10332	Therefore , it is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible . 	1
PE	10333	A great number of plants and animals died out because they were unable to fit into the new environment . 	0
PE	10334	The environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being . 	0
PE	10335	In conclusion , I agree with that the technology has more optimal effects on people ' s interaction , because it helps ordinary people to make new friends and to maintain relationships . 	1
PE	10336	In this way , technology is beneficial to humanity develops positive relationships . 	1
PE	10337	Also , they can connect with friends who have been out of touch for a long time by using the Internet . 	0
PE	10338	In the past , people might have had pen friends in other countries , but now , thanks to the social networking websites , people can easily to find someone who has similar interests . 	0
PE	10339	Therefore , the progress of news media is an advantageous development . 	1
PE	10340	Although some people view that government should be take a responsibility for this unfair situation , critics against such view . 	0
PE	10341	In a field of art , modern artist may receive high salary for their masterpiece creation while labors should be break their bone for years to get similar amount of money . 	0
PE	10342	The amount of money people earning sometimes is unfair . 	0
PE	10343	High sum of money of modern artist 	0
PE	10344	Also , the high sum which modern artists receive is related to the quality instead of the quantity and their rare talent . 	0
PE	10345	It is true while the modern artists who implement their creative thinking onto high value creation are paid with immense sum by the art collector . 	0
PE	10346	Proficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work . 	1
PE	10347	I agree that in this occasion the government is not granted to hand in . 	1
PE	10348	On the other hand , modern artists also devote themselves find a unique concept in which ordinary people cannot do , such making impossible become possible . 	0
PE	10349	For example , a 15 centimeter Buddha temple made by hand is granted times in comparison with factory production . 	0
PE	10350	Some people regard stress as a power , which overcomes the obstacles to motivate themselves to do their best ; other people cannot charge of their thoughts , emotions , and the way they deal with problems . 	0
PE	10351	In the frenetic , fast-paced world , it is a very common predicament that all of us , from the young to the senior , feel depressed caused by stress , such as financial problems , exam stress , relationship difficulties and work overload . 	0
PE	10352	But , we still need preserve other languages for sake of keeping the linguistic and cultural diversity . 	1
PE	10353	Personally , English as an elegant language should be advocated in many fields to expand the global trade and communications . 	1
PE	10354	Even English is a sophisticated language ; it does not express every detail of life especially in Asia countries , which have totally different linguistic system . 	0
PE	10355	However , the opponents believe that the dominated status of English has destroyed culture diversity and many less-used languages become extinct . 	1
PE	10356	Obviously , these languages have special significance for people who belong to them and using English to replace them is crudity . 	0
PE	10357	It is undeniable that language contains many aspects of people ' s daily life , which is influenced by culture , environment as well as religious . 	0
PE	10358	Moreover , rigorous exercise can also hone one ' s will , which enable people to be able to tackle stringent problems and arduous tasks . 	1
PE	10359	Thus good exercises can often successfully alleviating one ' s heavy burdens . 	0
PE	10360	This hormone can delight one ' s mind , creating positive feelings . 	0
PE	10361	When people exercise , the neuron cells in the brain release a chemical compound named Dopamine . 	0
PE	10362	Nevertheless , I assert that the best way of diminishing stress is by exercises , which can benefit everyone not only physically but also mentally . 	1
PE	10363	In a nutshell , many activities can let humans relax . 	1
PE	10364	For example , the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign . 	0
PE	10365	Therefore , a government ' s role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people ' s lives . 	1
PE	10366	Therefore , society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients . 	1
PE	10367	I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients . 	0
PE	10368	In my opinion , there is nothing more important than health in a human ' s life and the happiness and welfare come with health . 	0
PE	10369	The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society . 	0
PE	10370	In today ' s world , the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens . 	0
PE	10371	A greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues 	0
PE	10372	The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system . 	0
PE	10373	I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions . 	1
PE	10374	Therefore , one who has studied and lived overseas will become more eligible for the job than his / her peers . 	1
PE	10375	Becoming successful in this study will give the student an edge in job market . 	0
PE	10376	To begin with , it is vital that professors should assist students to acquire knowledge . 	0
PE	10377	The professors ’ duty is to nurture students , and prepare excellent courses . 	0
PE	10378	Similarly , how can we live safely and joyfully when our home is devastated by , ironically , by ourselves ? 	0
PE	10379	In conclusion , I think that in order to be a competitive worker , students must know their field in an advanced level . 	0
PE	10380	To my mind , students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects , rather than playing on guitar or singing a song . 	0
PE	10381	Nowadays , time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace . 	0
PE	10382	Therefore , music and other entertaining subjects should be optional . 	1
PE	10383	Increasingly however , students can not obtain supposed impacts , unless they get interested in it more seriously . 	0
PE	10384	Hence , I agree with the majority , because music is the art which requires special attitude towards it . 	0
PE	10385	In our hectic life , however , demand is not for musically orientated students , but for academically developed employees . 	0
PE	10386	By contrast , it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students . 	0
PE	10387	All in all , I am in the conviction that sports and social activities should obtain analogous concern and money in the view of above-mentioned reasons . 	1
PE	10388	They bring a lot of advantages and benefits for students and also affect their future in a positive way . 	1
PE	10389	There won ' t be any effect if school does so . 	0
PE	10390	Do arts and music improve the quality of life ? 	0
PE	10391	My view is that the government should give priorities to invest more money on the basic social welfares such as education and housing instead of subsidizing arts relative programs . 	1
PE	10392	Art is not the key determination of quality of life , but education is . 	1
PE	10393	In order to make people better off , it is more urgent for governments to commit money to some fundamental help such as setting more scholarships in education section for all citizens . 	0
PE	10394	This is simply because knowledge and wisdom is the guarantee of the enhancement of the quality of people ' s lives for a well-rounded social system . 	0
PE	10395	Admittedly , art , to some extent , serve a valuable function about enriching one ' s daily lives , for example , it could bring release one ' s heavy burden of study pressure and refresh human bodies through a hard day from work . 	1
PE	10396	However , it is unrealistic to pursuit of this high standard of life in many developing countries , in which the basic housing supply has still been a huge problem with plenty of lower income family have squeezed in a small tight room . 	0
PE	10397	By comparison to these issues , the pursuit of art seems unimportant at all . 	0
PE	10398	To conclude , art could play an active role in improving the quality of people ' s lives , but I think that governments should attach heavier weight to other social issues such as education and housing needs because those are the most essential ways enable to make people a decent life . 	1
PE	10399	The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account . 	1
PE	10400	First , there are several uncertainties about your professional future . 	0
PE	10401	Some of them had no own savings . 	0
PE	10402	As example I remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe . 	0
PE	10403	In recent years the majority of developed countries have a low saving rate because the people opt to spend their earnings immediately or they even take loans to finance their expenses . 	0
PE	10404	Saving / Spending money 	0
PE	10405	Im my opinion , saving some part of your earnings is essential due to the fact that you can not predict future developments , neither in your professional nor your personal life , furthermore with savings you can fulfill some of your dreams . 	1
PE	10406	But isn ' t it better to save your money for later investments or rough times ? 	0
PE	10407	In addition , you can not be sure about the development in your personal life . 	0
PE	10408	They could not afford the rent , so they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence . 	0
PE	10409	There was news about raising professors ' salary in my country . 	0
PE	10410	In actual , republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960 ' s . 	0
PE	10411	Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business . 	1
PE	10412	To be out of poverty , it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light , electricity , load , highways , natural resources , technology and buildings for companies . 	0
PE	10413	First of all , poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer . 	0
PE	10414	However , I agree that aiding poor countries has positive effects , overweighing its side-effects for the several reasons . 	1
PE	10415	In addition , a great amount of materials and money have poor countries being corrupted and politically dependent on other countries . 	1
PE	10416	It is true that just giving aid to impoverished countries could be manipulated by big power countries . 	1
PE	10417	That is why governmental and non-governmental organizations have been focus on being harmony and contribute to aid to poor countries . 	0
PE	10418	In this world , there is no one who does not know this world ' globalization ' , which means the world are more closer , and every single countries affects each other more than before in many ways . 	0
PE	10419	Giving aid to poorer countries has more negative effects than positive effect 	0
PE	10420	I believe that experiencing the real life by myself , I could learn more than just obey the advice . 	1
PE	10421	Parents and other predecessors used to experience their own life by themselves , why don ' t the younger try to do the same ? 	0
PE	10422	For one thing , there are so many grate things that you can missed if you don ' t experience it by yourself . 	0
PE	10423	For example , a friend told you not to try skydiving because it was so dangerous . 	0
PE	10424	If you did as he told , you could fail to see how wonderful it is to be fall freely . 	0
PE	10425	In addition , family and friends accidentally harm you by giving you advice all the time . 	0
PE	10426	You will grow to be dependent and reliant . 	0
PE	10427	In contrast , free yourself and do what you desire without notice about consequences is the way that success people would like to choose . 	0
PE	10428	According to myself , both ways are good , but I prefer the latter . 	0
PE	10429	It is because growth is a long process that experience is indispensable . 	0
PE	10430	However , I believe that it is not a good idea because most young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents . 	0
PE	10431	Moreover , parents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills . 	0
PE	10432	Thus , school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student as it is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life . 	1
PE	10433	Some people may argue that students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents . 	1
PE	10434	In conclusion , I strongly believe that non-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student ’ s development . 	1
PE	10435	Therefore , schools should not remove these subjects . 	1
PE	10436	For instance , paper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers , causing severe water pollution . 	0
PE	10437	On the other hand , the dramatic majority of tourist , particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages , are well educated . 	0
PE	10438	Some people may oppose these , citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism . 	1
PE	10439	In fact , compared to the tourism industry , other alternatives , like resource extraction and manufacture , are far worse destroyers . 	0
PE	10440	In conclusion , it is evident that under suitable administration , the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks . 	1
PE	10441	It is illogical to believe that these rational folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do so . 	0
PE	10442	After careful consideration of both sides of the argument , the tourism sector is desirable for its important socioeconomic advantages . 	1
PE	10443	Although those above reasons are acceptable , I would argue that there are many things much more important than having a job . 	0
PE	10444	Firstly , studying music , art or sports is also very important to students . 	0
PE	10445	This is understandable when labor market now has high competition ; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification . 	0
PE	10446	In addition , the unemployment rate is always high , so their parents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job . 	0
PE	10447	Although I accept that students have to study many subjects in school , I disagree with the idea that unimportant subjects such as music and sports should be got rid of the program . 	1
PE	10448	Many people believe that students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics , physics because these subject are necessary for students ' future . 	1
PE	10449	Schools should only teach children the academic subject 	0
PE	10450	People have many different views about what subjects should be taught in school . 	0
PE	10451	This enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them . 	0
PE	10452	Secondly , to get a job in labor market , not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork , presentation . 	0
PE	10453	As for me , I would follow the new customs , if I migrated to another country . 	1
PE	10454	Some people choose the former one to assimilate themselves into the new culture , while some insist the latter one because the new customs are difficult to be accepted . 	0
PE	10455	Furthermore , they can meet different people of the country . 	0
PE	10456	They can learn about their way of thinking , their customs and traditions , and way of life . 	0
PE	10457	Learning about others ' cultures is so important . 	0
PE	10458	It contributes in building a new understanding in us of how we see the world . 	0
PE	10459	For example , they will get exposed to a different educational system . 	0
PE	10460	They will meet new professors and new classmates which makes the academic experience different from that in their home country . 	0
PE	10461	Most important is the cultural aspect of the experience . 	1
PE	10462	While living in a foreign country , students can learn a lot about the culture of that country . 	0
PE	10463	It makes us more open , and willing to accept different ideas and thoughts . 	0
PE	10464	Also it educates us about the world we are living in . 	0
PE	10465	Consequently , conducting research is helpful for professors and students to some extent . 	0
PE	10466	In other word , professor should concern about preparing class . 	1
PE	10467	Only by developing students , can we have a better academic field . 	1
PE	10468	However , the precondition of doing research is growing students ’ solid theory fundamental . 	0
PE	10469	And some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions . 	0
PE	10470	They can manage the electric theory in practical skills . 	0
PE	10471	This is requires professors provide high quality courses . 	0
PE	10472	However , only under specific circumstance , when students master all of the systematic knowledge , can they accomplish research . 	0
PE	10473	Professors could combine doing research and preparing good courses in a dynamic way . 	1
PE	10474	In the future , many countries will try to prevent attach of other countries by using and invention new missiles . 	0
PE	10475	Space exploration has used as a tools for military power in the cold war . 	0
PE	10476	Therefore , it is very significant to find a new place for living in other planets . 	1
PE	10477	In during history , our planet is threatening by many of other planets or stars and it is an enormous danger for living of humanity . 	0
PE	10478	In 20th century , although human being succeeded to achieve out of space by means of new technologies such as rockets , but finding a new place for living in another planet is impossible until now . 	0
PE	10479	Many governments believe that space exploration is an activity that wastes the budget , while the essential challenge of humanity in the future would be the discovery of a new place for the living . 	0
PE	10480	In my opinion , spending the budget for space exploration is an important activity to save living of humanity in the future . 	1
PE	10481	The United state and Russia are the important countries that spend large budgets for the research of this subject . 	0
PE	10482	Space exploration , for discovery of out of space , has been possible for human in the 20th century . 	0
PE	10483	Nowadays , spending budget on space exploration is not reasonable 	0
PE	10484	In the following paragraphs , both sides of the above matter as well as my own view ' s explanations would be analyzed and given , respectively . 	0
PE	10485	Firstly , it is undoubtedly that thanks to modern technology invented recently , human life has been improved dramatically . 	1
PE	10486	Air-conditioners , computers , cellphones , washing machines , for example , is likely to be seen as greatest inventions helping people to reduce stress and time for other activities . 	0
PE	10487	Moreover , applying technological science into the preparation of medications also plays a significant role in saving the number of patients ' lives . 	0
PE	10488	Negative effects of technological process 	0
PE	10489	It is undeniable that technological process has brought numerous benefits making human life become more and more comfortable and easy . 	0
PE	10490	Some individuals assume that this technological development also causes many drawbacks impacting seriously on our lives . 	0
PE	10491	I personally disagree with this view . 	0
PE	10492	As far as I am concerned , both choices have their own advantages and disadvantages . 	1
PE	10493	On the one hand , living in a dormitory helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university . 	0
PE	10494	Dormitory or apartment ? 	0
PE	10495	When it comes to the issue of choosing an accommodation after completion of their high school , most students always get confused between these two options : living in an apartment , or in university dormitories . 	0
PE	10496	However , some negative aspects of technological process need to be mentioned clearly . 	0
PE	10497	In spite of bring fantastic advantages , technological products have devastated the natural environment indirectly through its production process . 	1
PE	10498	For instance , students can have an opportunity to take part in many kind of extracurricular activities happing around the campus such as attending conversation club , or joining sports club . 	0
PE	10499	Students can also have more chance of interaction with their teachers and classmates . 	0
PE	10500	The research projects like windows opened to the wider world . 	1
PE	10501	Although my university is not in the high-ranking list , he gained a reputation by those projects . 	0
PE	10502	It is very common to see state-of-the-art laboratories in the campus . 	0
PE	10503	Secondly , professors should fully use the research-friendly environment provided by universities . 	1
PE	10504	Consequently , there is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages . 	0
PE	10505	Also , you could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together . 	0
PE	10506	Universities positively contribute the professors ' success . 	0
PE	10507	We all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin . 	0
PE	10508	With the help of research projects , professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom . 	0
PE	10509	Last but not least , doing research could also improve the teaching quality . 	1
PE	10510	Because children are poor at time management , and are less mature to make a good judgment , they cannot be too serious to be taken care when watching TV and movies . 	1
PE	10511	However , it doesn ' t mean that children should do it overtime and without being taken care what they are watching . 	0
PE	10512	In considering whether the time children watching on TV or movies should be constrained , I hold a strongly positive point of view toward this issue . 	1
PE	10513	Spending equal amount of money on libraries and sports ? 	0
PE	10514	University students can be divided into two groups , one group with less interest to study and the other which include hard working students . 	0
PE	10515	Usually the second group ' s members do not have enough time to do exercise . 	0
PE	10516	We all know doing exercise for at least 30 minutes form the basis of the healthy and happy life . 	0
PE	10517	But I don ' t think that equal amount of money should be spent on academic issues like libraries and laboratories and physical or social activities . 	1
PE	10518	First , in my view spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football / basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports . 	1
PE	10519	For example , my roommate , Mary , always wakes up 6 in the morning and spends 1 hour doing sport in the park which is near our dormitory . 	0
PE	10520	When she gets to the dorm , she is really full of energy and after taking a shower , she is ready to start a good day . 	0
PE	10521	As you see , she is doing exercise without spending a cent . 	0
PE	10522	What the university should do is informing the students the benefits of doing sport by hanging some posters in the campus , inviting some athletes to lecture for students and encourage them to spend some time for their body and health . 	0
PE	10523	A world sportive competition event is watched by almost every country around the world and provide social stimulus and people gathering . 	0
PE	10524	Popular events are essential 	0
PE	10525	Obviously these events gather people and their nationalist pride feeling is increased . 	0
PE	10526	These emotions are shared locally in our village or city , nationally in our own country but even internationally too . 	0
PE	10527	The main purpose of such competitions is to enjoy and share emotions between supporters though their favorite team . 	0
PE	10528	As a matter of fact , world sport events provide positive waves for number of people . 	1
PE	10529	One of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content . 	1
PE	10530	They have a serious impact on people in their puberty . 	0
PE	10531	For example , an internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal , where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off . 	0
PE	10532	Another supporting reason is that television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture . 	1
PE	10533	Amount of control on media information 	0
PE	10534	Nowadays , one of the most controversial issues related to mass media is the correct amount of control posed on newspapers , televisions and websites . 	0
PE	10535	It is argued that the government should exercise less restriction on sharing of media information to public . 	0
PE	10536	However , I strongly believe that it should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures . 	1
PE	10537	A few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser . 	0
PE	10538	This is actually very environmentally unfriendly . 	0
PE	10539	First and foremost , it is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor , engineer and lawyer . 	1
PE	10540	Nevertheless , I feel that one can also shine without even having to attend universities . 	1
PE	10541	Not only that , when they are in a university , they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners . 	0
PE	10542	Without proper training and knowledge , it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers . 	0
PE	10543	In today ' s modern and competitive society , it is undeniable that we must equip ourselves with plenty of knowledge and skills in order to shine and to be successful in life . 	0
PE	10544	University education is needed for success 	0
PE	10545	I do agree to that opinion to a certain degree . 	0
PE	10546	Many opine that the aforementioned aspects are mostly obtained through learning in academic institutions . 	0
PE	10547	Computers have made humans over-dependent . 	1
PE	10548	However , everything has pros and cons . 	0
PE	10549	There is no end to the evolution of computers . 	0
PE	10550	Research on making computerized drone soldiers ( unmanned computer controlled ) is going on . 	0
PE	10551	Looking from another perspective , there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university . 	1
PE	10552	This can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals . 	0
PE	10553	Moreover , future prospects of computers are very bright . 	1
PE	10554	Computers provide speed , increase efficiency , accuracy , precision , help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it . 	1
PE	10555	Also , it is obvious that , to survive in this competitive world , one has to work hard and equip themselves well . 	1
PE	10556	That is how , computer impacts children on a positive note . 	1
PE	10557	This will be proven by analyzing how computer assists children to use vast resources available over internet to study effectively as well as develop some basic skills which help them in future careers . 	1
PE	10558	The best thing about internet is the availability of information in the form of text , image or video related to almost everything and through computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about . 	0
PE	10559	Around the globe , the effect is evident on children also . 	0
PE	10560	It is disagreed that computer can affect children in a negative way if they use a computer on a daily basis . 	1
PE	10561	Using a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects 	0
PE	10562	In today ' s world , computer is an essential part of everyday life . 	0
PE	10563	For instance , some people abandon their job , family and friends and go to other country without knowing what the future holds for them . 	0
PE	10564	The car use will definitely decrease in twenty years 	0
PE	10565	Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether cars will be less than there are today in twenty years or not . 	0
PE	10566	Some people believe that since the environmental concern has risen , the car use will decrease . 	0
PE	10567	While others think that a personal car is important for ones daily life . 	0
PE	10568	Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason . 	0
PE	10569	But as far as I am concerned , I agree with the idea , which is that there will be a decrease in cars use in the future . 	1
PE	10570	The following reasons will present my points . 	0
PE	10571	First of all , since the public transportation has improved , it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus . 	1
PE	10572	For accomplishing their missions , the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks . 	0
PE	10573	They bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit . 	0
PE	10574	A solid group can be a suited environment , which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons . 	0
PE	10575	By participating in an organization , it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose . 	1
PE	10576	When being in the department of art , I have not only learned how to do a project , but also known some famous artists during the term . 	0
PE	10577	For example , as a student majoring in mass media , I have taken part in mass media student group for a year . 	0
PE	10578	Furthermore , groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal . 	1
PE	10579	Above all , it is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job . 	0
PE	10580	Tzu Chi , a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan , is famous for contributing to the social and community services , and medical care . 	0
PE	10581	Here is an example : there are various charities in the world . 	0
PE	10582	Importantly , when students start their university studies after a break , they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge . 	0
PE	10583	Nevertheless , during high school , many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in . 	0
PE	10584	A continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot , to follow instructions . 	0
PE	10585	Personally , a break will give students some time to refresh their systems , by traveling or following their hobbies . 	1
PE	10586	In most education systems , a child studies continuously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age . 	0
PE	10587	A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change . 	0
PE	10588	Some countries permit students to take a break from studies between high school and university studies , while in some countries , it is considered as waste of time . 	0
PE	10589	However , a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school . 	1
PE	10590	Is a break good or bad after high school for students 	0
PE	10591	Studies are an essential part of life . 	0
PE	10592	This will improve the quality of both universities and students , thus placing people in positions which suit them most . 	1
PE	10593	It is necessary for every citizen to have the awareness and knowledge of environment protection . 	0
PE	10594	This means that we should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society , and the government controls many influential media , such as TV stations and newspapers , which can provide plenty of environmental knowledge and related policies to citizens . 	1
PE	10595	There is a viewpoint that the government and big firms should assume the responsibility to protect the environment and normal citizens have nothing to do for that . 	0
PE	10596	Personally , I think both government and common people should have the responsibility for the environment , but we need to analyze some specific situations . 	1
PE	10597	The environment problems facing today ' s world are so great 	0
PE	10598	Nowadays , many countries are concerned with the environment problems . 	0
PE	10599	However , individuals are unable to cope with these things . 	0
PE	10600	Besides , the government and firms could have significant influences on environmental awareness of people . 	0
PE	10601	On one hand , solving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies , and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems . 	1
PE	10602	For example , air pollution and water quality has concerned many countries , and the government is able to implement some policies and invest money to reduce air pollution , while companies also can enhance their technologies to curb emission of contaminated water and substances . 	0
PE	10603	In conclusion , I believe demerits of watching TV outweigh its merits and thus if students were allowed to freely watch TV without any proper controls by parents or teachers then it would produce more negative effects on children . 	1
PE	10604	Sometimes , students watch restrictive programs not allowed for their ages and this can have major psychological consequences . 	0
PE	10605	Many times , students get addictive to their favorite programs like Cartoon channels , or baseball and easily get distracted from study during exam period and this can seriously impact their grades . 	0
PE	10606	This experience also makes them aware of what they would like to make of their life . 	0
PE	10607	The financial burden of families , for instance , has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money . 	0
PE	10608	In the second place , the revolution in females ' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well . 	1
PE	10609	This is to say , the " weaker " gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men , not to mention they even perform better in some fields . 	0
PE	10610	Women nowadays are much more active , they may be successful businessmen , they join the political world , they become scientists and so on . 	1
PE	10611	Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children . 	0
PE	10612	To start with , the fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society . 	0
PE	10613	This , contrary to some ideas , is a positive progress in human society from my point of view . 	1
PE	10614	Women have been opened up to more chances than ever . 	0
PE	10615	The modern times have witnessed profound changes in most aspects of life , including the revolution of feminism . 	0
PE	10616	Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past 	0
PE	10617	Another important thing to consider is that the teacher should be well-trained in the use of this specific language , so quality education will be delivered . 	0
PE	10618	Moreover , teachers think that foreign language most likely leads to confusion for children who are yet to start learning . 	0
PE	10619	I personally believe that it is important for children to be taught with a secondary language as early as kindergarten . 	1
PE	10620	This issue has garnered some attention in the academe as it has an impact on the children ' s learning . 	0
PE	10621	Learning at school must be convenient for them if they speak in a way that they are used to . 	0
PE	10622	To begin with , children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years . 	1
PE	10623	Educational institutions have different systems when it comes to introducing foreign languages to children . 	0
PE	10624	Foreign language instruction should begin in kindergarten 	0
PE	10625	However , those who disagree contend that this should be taught in later years . 	0
PE	10626	Some people believe that foreign language instruction should start in pre-school . 	0
PE	10627	In conclusion , people without talents cannot be famous in this changing world and to be accredited they need to contribute positively to young generation . 	1
PE	10628	Secondly , pets are useful for a variety of things . 	1
PE	10629	Since we are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day , many people often get lost . 	0
PE	10630	However , it takes time for people to adapt them . 	0
PE	10631	For example , we no longer have to travel to DMV to renew our driver ' s license or drive to bank for sending money . 	0
PE	10632	Students have become more and more stressed during the last few years due to the increase in academic tasks assigned by their teachers to improve their academic success . 	0
PE	10633	In addition , Learning a foreign language helps students tremendously to comprehend what happens in the around World . 	0
PE	10634	They would be able to understand other cultures and costumes . 	0
PE	10635	Moreover , It can give them a sense of power to communicate better with peers in other parts of the World . 	0
PE	10636	Having knowledge about other countries and their languages lead to extend the child ' s vision . 	0
PE	10637	Therefore , they would be able to develop their personalities and sense of reliance . 	1
PE	10638	Overall , it is easy to distinguish between a child having two languages and a child having just his native language while comparing their ability to communicate , understanding other studies , etc , to find that why children should start learning a foreign language in the beginning of the education . 	1
PE	10639	In conclusion , advertising is not the primary reason of unhealthy eating habits . 	1
PE	10640	There are the build-up of the concept about healthy eating habits and self-control that really matter . 	1
PE	10641	Technology designed to make people ' s lives simpler often make them more complicated 	0
PE	10642	People can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources , like news or magazines . 	0
PE	10643	As long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits , they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations . 	0
PE	10644	It will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast-food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors . 	0
PE	10645	Second , in the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle , some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods . 	0
PE	10646	In other words , advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people . 	1
PE	10647	Think about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added . 	0
PE	10648	These are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good . 	0
PE	10649	In these cases , the advertising industry bolsters people ' s awareness of having a healthy lifestyle . 	0
PE	10650	However , even with all the conveniences , we would have to admit that technologies made our lives more complicated . 	1
PE	10651	In addition , schools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people . 	0
PE	10652	Therefore , I never have been rich in my life , because my salary is not dramatically changed . 	1
PE	10653	In spite of many problems of having own business , I can earn more money based on my creativity and personal ideas . 	0
PE	10654	The amount of money is always the most important criterion for everyone to choose a job . 	0
PE	10655	To sum up , in spite of the fact that many people are not eager to work for themselves , I would like to run my own business to control my own time , and to earn more money based on my noble ideas . 	1
PE	10656	High-salary instructors don ' t teach students harder because they earn more money . 	0
PE	10657	This event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly . 	0
PE	10658	Concerning that elementary education , like the base of a architecture , is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today ' s society , government should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it . 	0
PE	10659	So a lack of well-established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy , and this interplay seriously compromises a country ' s future development . 	0
PE	10660	To improve education , spending more money to raise professors ' salary is inappropriate . 	1
PE	10661	In other words , if countries , especially the developing countries , are determined to take off , one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education . 	1
PE	10662	Besides , the ultimate purpose is to change , to motivate students to be better . 	0
PE	10663	Finally , quality takes time . 	0
PE	10664	Some professors don ' t deserve the money at all , then , what ' s the point to spend money on them ? 	0
PE	10665	If you do not hurry yourself you can take more time for your family and friends . 	0
PE	10666	In addition , will the university filter all the professors overall ? 	0
PE	10667	Caring for your social environment will increase your happiness and also reduce your stress level . 	0
PE	10668	Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both . 	0
PE	10669	Universities giving both genders equal opportunities , will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run . 	1
PE	10670	For example , students studying in boy ' s colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them . 	0
PE	10671	On the other hand , females studying in girl ' s colleges are too shy to face boys . 	0
PE	10672	Women like Margaret Thatcher , Indira Gandhi , Mari Curie etc . , are symbols of women ' s intelligence and skills . 	0
PE	10673	It is no wonder that governments throughout the world lay special emphasis on education development . 	0
PE	10674	Unfortunately , some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields , like maths , mechanical engineering , defense etc . This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society . 	1
PE	10675	Time and again , women have proved their mettle in every field . 	0
PE	10676	Equality in education will help in development of the society . 	1
PE	10677	If you are always facing excessive stress you cannot care for your beloved ' s . 	0
PE	10678	The zoo deserves maintenance and public respect 	0
PE	10679	Secondly , the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection . 	1
PE	10680	Nowadays the process of globalisation is accompanied by the encroachment upon natural habitats , which consequently calls for the help of zoos . 	0
PE	10681	By listening to your family and friends advice , you can definitely avoid many unexpected things . 	0
PE	10682	On the other hand , finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature . 	1
PE	10683	Therefore , learning about life , which is useful for foreseeing problems and be assertive enough to overcome them are needed . 	0
PE	10684	Two main ways of learning about life are listening to the advice of family and friends and learning through personal experience . 	0
PE	10685	The best way of learning life 	0
PE	10686	Life is full of challenges , difficulties and unexpected obstacles . 	0
PE	10687	Family members such as your parents are experienced in life so they can give you proper and sincere guidance on every aspect of life . 	0
PE	10688	And friends , people who are the same generation with you , they are understand your favorite and ability enough to tell you which is suitable for you , which is not . 	0
PE	10689	Both ways are good to follow because they all have their own distinct advantages . 	0
PE	10690	On one hand , the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter . 	1
PE	10691	Universities are relatively fenced environment . 	0
PE	10692	First of all , doing research is a method of self-improvement for professors . 	0
PE	10693	In addition , by doing research , professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies . 	0
PE	10694	The research projects provide communication with the outside . 	0
PE	10695	These days , more and more university professors are involved in scientific research . 	0
PE	10696	Professors should do more research or teach students ? 	0
PE	10697	However , according to my experiences , professors should be encouraged to mainly do research . 	1
PE	10698	Some are afraid that this will lead to the decline of education quality and suggest them to spend more time on teaching . 	0
PE	10699	He was often invited to do speech in other universities . 	0
PE	10700	I still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college . 	0
PE	10701	All things considered , in a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles . 	1
PE	10702	Yet everything has it upside and downside , women should find the best way to overcome such challenges . 	0
PE	10703	Also , children might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work . 	0
PE	10704	Admittedly , such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate or , under many circumstances , women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives . 	1
PE	10705	What is more , women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration . 	0
PE	10706	By way of conclusion , I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work ; on the contrary , they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas – this world needs them to make itself colourful . 	1
PE	10707	Cars use oil and gasoline and send out gas such as carbon dioxide , heat and so on . 	0
PE	10708	The use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution . 	1
PE	10709	The development of public transportation is the most essential thing for a developed society . 	1
PE	10710	Public transportation keeps society from the depletion of natural resources 	0
PE	10711	So , I think the government have to spend more money on improving it . 	0
PE	10712	Public transportation keeps society from the depletion of natural resources , the air pollution , the loss of a sense of community . 	1
PE	10713	Cars depend on oil and gasoline to move . 	0
PE	10714	The use of public transportation is the best way to conserve natural resources gradually run out . 	1
PE	10715	Instead of using many private cars , people can use public transportation , such as bus , train , subway , each one can get far more people and less oil and gasoline are used up per person . 	0
PE	10716	If people use too many private cars , the oil and gasoline nonrenewable will run out quickly . 	0
PE	10717	Admittedly , applying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers ' economic profit . 	0
PE	10718	While some appear to believe that advanced plant foods incorporate with newly developed devices significantly reduce the cost of producing farm products , others argue that this collaboration exerts a series of negative effects to people ' s health condition and the society . 	0
PE	10719	In recent years , the discussion about the agriculture development has become a controversy . 	0
PE	10720	Advanced fertilizers and machine for farmers , good or bad ? 	0
PE	10721	Unlike the organic plant foods , industrialized fertilizers are made of unusual chemicals , which are not only varying the gene of crops into those unknown substances but also remaining inside of plants permanently . 	0
PE	10722	However , high-tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals ' health well-being . 	1
PE	10723	Consequently , the production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased . 	1
PE	10724	This is because artificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops , and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest . 	0
PE	10725	Moreover , excessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society . 	1
PE	10726	In this case , consumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future . 	0
PE	10727	Because of the similarity I talked before , acquaintances probably not able to understand you better than your friends . 	0
PE	10728	Second , close friends can easily understand each others feelings . 	1
PE	10729	Everyone play the role of acquaintance and friend at the same time . 	0
PE	10730	Moreover , they wouldn ' t even spare time to consider your feelings . 	0
PE	10731	When my friend is sick , I would not only ask if he is okay like an acquaintance but do my best to make him get well as soon as possible . 	0
PE	10732	Being friendly is a good way to treat a acquaintance but way not enough for a friend . 	0
PE	10733	Having job would affect their health , divert them from studies and take away one of the important phase from their life . 	1
PE	10734	Thus , for a teenager it is important to pay attention on their studies . 	1
PE	10735	Therefore , they should take advantage of life as much possible they can . 	1
PE	10736	If my friend is going to the wrong direction in his life trail , I will try my best to pull him back , but not stand and stare like it ' s not of my business . 	0
PE	10737	To me , friends are the most important people in my life second to my family . 	1
PE	10738	In conclusion , a friend is a person you care about . 	1
PE	10739	This means , there will be children , grandparents , as well as pregnant women inside the restaurants . 	0
PE	10740	Secondly , restaurants are places that people usually come with their families . 	0
PE	10741	They will not be able to enjoy their meals while breathing in smoke around them . 	0
PE	10742	Smoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals . 	1
PE	10743	First of all , restaurants are places where people come and pay some money to enjoy their meals . 	0
PE	10744	In my opinion , smoking should not be permitted , especially in public places like restaurants because it will make the non-smokers breathe uncomfortably . 	1
PE	10745	Although many smokers claim that they need to smoke in order to work more effectively or to think more creatively , those reasons never proves that smoking has any benefits for human ' s body . 	0
PE	10746	There are so many researches done to prove that a cigar contains harmful ingredients for human ' s body . 	0
PE	10747	Generally speaking , smoking is never been good for human ' s body . 	0
PE	10748	Smoking should not be permitted in restaurants 	0
PE	10749	And if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics , I could not pass the entire part of physics , and I will fail the exam over and over again . 	0
PE	10750	But I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics . 	0
PE	10751	And I can study physics without consideration of my electronics . 	0
PE	10752	Luckily , in our university , you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach . 	0
PE	10753	Secondly , if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam , students are highly likely to leave uncultivated . 	1
PE	10754	And at last , I took the electronics again and pass the exam . 	0
PE	10755	And the students will have nothing to do in the campus . 	0
PE	10756	If one fail most of the exam , it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes . 	0
PE	10757	The academic achievement will decline . 	0
PE	10758	Then he or she will play online games days and nights . 	0
PE	10759	Last but not least , language is one of the essential factors creating the differences and unique cutures in the world . 	0
PE	10760	In addition , forming a language must be undergone thousands of years ; thus , it deserves to be respected and preserved . 	0
PE	10761	For instance , I have a neighbor who are old , black skin and frown and I had always panicked of her . 	0
PE	10762	Second of all , there are some people who are black skin , fat and frown , nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague . 	1
PE	10763	We can never judge about a person with his or her appearance . 	1
PE	10764	From my point of view although appearance is important , personality is the most important . 	1
PE	10765	Individuals have two features , one of them is appearance and the other one is personality . 	0
PE	10766	Best way to judge about people is to be familiar with their personality - not with their look 	0
PE	10767	For example , some people cheat their fiance before marriage by showing a cheerful face and well spoken ; however , after getting marriage they show their real personality . 	0
PE	10768	First of all , there are people who play a role and cheat the other individuals with their playing , therefore we have to be aware to never judge with their appearance . 	1
PE	10769	I completely disagree with these kind of judgement which someone makes . 	0
PE	10770	Some people believes , individuals who have black skin or are frown are not good person and in opposite individuals who have pale or white skin or always have smile on their face are good person . 	0
PE	10771	Thus , capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals . 	1
PE	10772	Moreover , capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes . 	0
PE	10773	Its first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings . 	0
PE	10774	When a criminal becomes a threat to the society , such that they can commit heinous crimes , then they are given capital punishment . 	0
PE	10775	However , strict laws , like capital punishment , are essential in a society . 	1
PE	10776	Capital punishment is given only in the " rarest of the rare " cases . 	0
PE	10777	Retribution is the method for countering criminals . 	0
PE	10778	Some countries have stringent rules , like capital punishment , while other have a lot of flexibility in the judicial system . 	0
PE	10779	Capital punishment - necessary or not 	0
PE	10780	Crime is always punishable . 	0
PE	10781	I , in my childhood , was just a typical case . 	0
PE	10782	Watching TV for a long time without doing homework is one of major headaches that most of children have brought to their parents . 	1
PE	10783	First of all , children generally have weak self-control , and thus they lose their time easily . 	0
PE	10784	As far as I am concerned , I agree with that children should be forbidden in watching television or movies excessively . 	1
PE	10785	Children , who are addicted to TV , causes broad argument about whether they should be limited in watching television in amount of time . 	0
PE	10786	For its accessible and containing fancy programs , television attracts audiences from a wide range of age and background . 	0
PE	10787	In 19th century , television is one of an significant inventions and has become a indispensible appliance in every house . 	0
PE	10788	Should parents limit their children watching TV to make them do well in school ? 	0
PE	10789	Moreover , if we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem , it is neither unethical nor immoral . 	0
PE	10790	If you kill a criminal , you become a criminal . 	0
PE	10791	Finally , with some of serious criminals , capital punishment is an easy way out . 	1
PE	10792	In short , crimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment . 	0
PE	10793	Secondly , nobody has the right to take another human life . 	1
PE	10794	Hence , death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture . 	1
PE	10795	I could watch TV for hours , but I could hardly sit in front of my desk to do homework for few minutes . 	0
PE	10796	Whenever I back to home from school , the first thing I would do is turning on the television and sit there for hours . 	0
PE	10797	By casting famous singers in their television advertisement , motorcycles or clothes for example , sales increase significantly since youngsters , as the target consumers , love celebrities . 	0
PE	10798	High sales reflect power of advertising and not the real need 	0
PE	10799	Nowadays , we can see advertisements everywhere , from television set to posters on the streets . 	0
PE	10800	Some people say that advertising must be blamed for the unhealthy eating habits , while others believe that there are still some other factors directing people ' s judgments . 	0
PE	10801	I tend to agree with this view . 	0
PE	10802	However , a meal which is nutritionally balanced is always most recommended . 	0
PE	10803	To sum up , it is evident for me that people choose to become vegetarians for health and religious concern rather than the benefits of animals . 	1
PE	10804	However , I am convinced that it is vital to follow one ' s own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind . 	1
PE	10805	It is often said that this view is rather unscientific . 	0
PE	10806	Some religion , such as Buddha , believes that animals were human being in their previous life , so eating their meat mean you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings . 	0
PE	10807	Secondy , relegious beliefs also contributes to a vegetarian diet . 	0
PE	10808	But these young people do not take into account that their lives are going to be more difficult , when they are away from home . 	1
PE	10809	They will have to pay a lot of bills , because they will have to find a lodging or at least a place where to live and in order to have less expenses they will have to find a co-tenant , who they may not like . 	0
PE	10810	Some young adults want independence from their parents quickly 	0
PE	10811	Many young adults want to get away from their parent ' s houses as soon as possible in order to have no limits , to be independent . 	0
PE	10812	If the young adults still study they will have to combine studying with working , because they will not have money to pay for everything . 	0
PE	10813	There will not be such worries when young adults live in their own home , because parents will take care for them . 	0
PE	10814	Living in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money . 	1
PE	10815	If they live separate from their parents they will have to pay for a loan , electricity , water or even for a meal . 	0
PE	10816	Moreover , parents will give their children money in order they to focus only on studying . 	0
PE	10817	Another problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co-tenant , who they do not like . 	1
PE	10818	After all , retirement not only marks the end of an individual , but also gives him a chance to make up for what he has lost throughout his working life . 	0
PE	10819	From social perspective , massively forcing the early retirement would be one of financial burden to the local government . 	0
PE	10820	It is undeniable that every person within the business enterprise has the rights to proceed their work as long as they are capable of doing it , disregard the age and physical capacity . 	0
PE	10821	In conclusion , even though the introduction of the early retirement has some benefits , it is convincing that it would generate a sense of discrimination among different age groups and increase the government financial pressure accordingly . 	1
PE	10822	For example , sufficient pension payments and regular medical care should be given and arranged for the senior citizens after they have been imposed to terminate their employment permanently . 	0
PE	10823	It is not to say , of course , that other points of view are completely without merit . 	0
PE	10824	I firmly believe that psychopaths , terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment . 	1
PE	10825	Capital punishment is essential to control violence in the society . 	1
PE	10826	However , it should be considered as the last option by the jury and all circumstances must be taken into account before pronouncing the final verdict . 	0
PE	10827	Capital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner . 	1
PE	10828	However , still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum , instead , they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done . 	0
PE	10829	Besides , most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs . 	0
PE	10830	Those who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness . 	1
PE	10831	This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects . 	0
PE	10832	However , the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected . 	0
PE	10833	Most importantly , under such target-oriented education environment , teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study . 	0
PE	10834	Moreover , the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study . 	0
PE	10835	It is undeniable that concentrating on one subject can reduce students ' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents , while its shortfalls are so vital to students ' future . 	1
PE	10836	Therefore , I do support the view of learning all school subjects . 	1
PE	10837	Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour . 	0
PE	10838	Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains . 	0
PE	10839	For example , I have started to read a novel since last week . 	0
PE	10840	I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day , so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class . 	0
PE	10841	In contrast , I cannot watch a complete movie because I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that , I have to study . 	0
PE	10842	Some people might argue that people enjoy watching TV when they know they can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies . 	1
PE	10843	This point has some merits on the surface ; however , movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners since characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners . 	0
PE	10844	For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable . 	0
PE	10845	To sum up , reading fictions is more pleasant because these books have more depth , are much easier to use , and more useful for language learners . 	1
PE	10846	Compared to other hobbies such as going to theater or going to sports stadium , it is a very cost-effective hobby that gives viewer quiet a few indirect experiences . 	0
PE	10847	However , from my point of view , television has more bad than good because it has made people not to have conversation each other . 	1
PE	10848	Television has more bad than good in respect of bonds with family and friends 	0
PE	10849	There are many interesting programs on television which anyone can enjoy at little cost . 	0
PE	10850	Thus , they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time since they think the programs are so crucial to their lives . 	0
PE	10851	One of my friends , for example , once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show " Infinete Challenges " . 	0
PE	10852	To begin with , television shows make people forget what is really important . 	1
PE	10853	One who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air . 	0
PE	10854	This is not only about basketball , but also about our friendship , which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other . 	0
PE	10855	That is , watching television alone at home , my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us . 	0
PE	10856	Not only teachers could amplify their performance but the whole education system are also improve performance from evaluation made by students . 	0
PE	10857	Thereby , evaluating from students is one of the ways to improve quality of educational system . 	0
PE	10858	Getting opinions from many sources could augment people ' s performance . 	0
PE	10859	Getting opinions from many sources could augment people ' s performance . 	0
PE	10860	Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information . 	0
PE	10861	For example , evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product . 	0
PE	10862	To begin with , Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers ' performance . 	0
PE	10863	Therefore , I agree with this notion that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers . 	1
PE	10864	Therefore , evaluating from students could improve teachers ' performance . 	1
PE	10865	Consequently , teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give . 	0
PE	10866	Furthermore , thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products . 	1
PE	10867	Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights . 	0
PE	10868	For instance , cows are often injected by Oxytocin , a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation . 	0
PE	10869	This in turn , causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle . 	0
PE	10870	From my prospective , human being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters . 	1
PE	10871	Animal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior and manipulation of them should be punished as a serious crime . 	1
PE	10872	Many other practices like , equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster . 	0
PE	10873	And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals . 	0
PE	10874	Learner could learn how to use tools and see actual organs of fog . 	0
PE	10875	For example , in biology class , learning anatomy by operating fog have many benefits . 	0
PE	10876	Hence I strongly believe in hard working that would not easily disappoint you as luck sometimes does . 	1
PE	10877	In conclusion , I certainly can say that growing of violence in films have definitely negative effects on youngsters mostly on their study , emotions and behaviors . 	1
PE	10878	He realized that having a master ' s degree would be a great credential for him to outperform his competitors . 	0
PE	10879	Although he had many commitments at home and work , he somehow managed to complete this degree before he was eligible to apply . 	0
PE	10880	At the end he was not only able to get the promotion amidst a stiff competition but also got nominated for a foreign scholarship since he had more credentials than other officers in his capacity . 	0
PE	10881	Although it is good to be lucky , depending on luck for everything is not good . 	1
PE	10882	Therefore , if these scenes are in TV , they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child . 	1
PE	10883	For instance , dying is always a disappointing happening . 	0
PE	10884	Furthermore , killing is worse . 	0
PE	10885	In this condition , because he is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it , it is obvious that he wouldn ’ t be able to concentrate on his study perfectly . 	0
PE	10886	Hence , the study of a youngster would affected terribly . 	1
PE	10887	For example , a child watches a frightening movie . 	0
PE	10888	There are many advantages of distance learning , but it should not replace classroom learning . 	1
PE	10889	I think limiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice since it will reward the motivation of students and constantly keep them in the difficult level of learning , which makes them do the best to improve themselves . 	0
PE	10890	As the world ' s situation is always changing , act for distributing education needs are absolutely important to compete the future challenges . 	1
PE	10891	No matter how advanced technology will be , it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils . 	0
PE	10892	As a recent interview with Josh Trumm – the founder of the ' Teachers Global Group ' - reveals , human interactions will never be imitated by computers : ' This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper education . 	0
PE	10893	Without someone who can explain and understand their problems , pupils cannot actually learn ' . 	0
PE	10894	I am inclined to agree with this scientific view , because only a teacher can feel and connect with pupils , be a friend and a model . 	0
PE	10895	In conclusion , there can be no school without a teacher . 	1
PE	10896	I think that computers will continue to be used by teachers in the learning process , but they will never take their place . 	1
PE	10897	Teachers are not just teachers , they are also friends and conseilieurs . 	1
PE	10898	Living with a roommate made socializing much easier for me . 	0
PE	10899	Finally , living with a roommate allows me to get help . 	1
PE	10900	Even though his friends and I were total strangers to each other , we quickly got to know each other . 	0
PE	10901	We soon found out that everyone loved playing video games . 	0
PE	10902	We played a video game called ' Halo ' together all night , and became good friends . 	0
PE	10903	I was able to save a lot of money by sharing wasted heating and rooms with my friend and splitting the bills . 	0
PE	10904	Apart from saving a lot of money , living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily . 	1
PE	10905	It is always easier to socialize when you have a lot of people around you . 	0
PE	10906	You can invite your roommates ' friends over to your room and have fun together . 	0
PE	10907	To give an example , I used to be good at math when I was in junior high school . 	0
PE	10908	Both local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services , and more employment opportunities can be created as well . 	0
PE	10909	I also believe the revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment . 	0
PE	10910	Furthermore , the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well . 	1
PE	10911	The provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably . 	0
PE	10912	With adequate local facilities and services available , they can spend more of their holidays having fun and relaxing . 	0
PE	10913	In addition , both locals and tourists can experience more cultures than ever before , and they can be more open-minded to eliminate preconceptions and deepen mutual understanding among nations . 	0
PE	10914	In conclusion , the prosperity of tourism can provide benefits for people on a global scale . 	1
PE	10915	Although there are some inevitable problems , they are outweighed by advantages and can be tackled if proper measures are taken . 	1
PE	10916	Instead of waiting for next publication , people can get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two . 	0
PE	10917	This explains why digital media will rule over paper and magazines . 	1
PE	10918	The friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth . 	0
PE	10919	In such situations , newspapers and magazines can not respond as fast as digital media . 	0
PE	10920	But internet provides efficient search facility where one can search the topic and get the details . 	0
PE	10921	This feature of digital media is not supported by newspapers and magazines . 	0
PE	10922	People often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research , satisfy interest , etc . For example , one research fellow may want to know how a small village named Oramaki in Japan was suffering after Second World War . 	1
PE	10923	It is very difficult to get this sort of information from past in newspapers and magazines as one has to know before where to look at . 	0
PE	10924	To conclude , the fast responding internet media with vast information will be replacing newspapers and magazines as new and information provider for valid reasons . 	1
PE	10925	Though considering the current infrastructure and mindset of people , paper media will continue for another few years . 	1
PE	10926	Wherever possible , exams should match the content and activities of the learning environment . 	0
PE	10927	Exam task should be varied to give fair opportunities to candidates with different types of skills . 	0
PE	10928	In this case , teachers and learners focus only on theses aspects of the curriculum that are likely to be tested , thus narrowing the educational experience for all . 	0
PE	10929	A number of measures should be taken to address these concerns . 	1
PE	10930	However , exams need to be carefully designed and supplemented with other forms of evaluation if they are to be a truly useful component of the education system . 	1
PE	10931	Other types of assessment should also be considered , assignment writing , for example , to assess independent learning and research skills , or group projects , to measure teamwork ability . 	0
PE	10932	In conclusion , it is convincing that exams have a role to play in ensuring proper and objective assessment of achievement . 	1
PE	10933	However , it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention . 	0
PE	10934	Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced . 	0
PE	10935	In conclusion , both of the arguments have strong supports , but in my own view , more good come from zoos than bad . 	1
PE	10936	Also , zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life . 	0
PE	10937	This is due to the fact that , in zoos , animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters . 	0
PE	10938	Many people , especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals , cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world . 	0
PE	10939	Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public . 	0
PE	10940	Furthermore , stress takes a toll on our health . 	0
PE	10941	Therefore , stress management recently becomes a more significant issue in our realization . 	1
PE	10942	This is one of the reasons why people were overwhelmed by constant stress . 	0
PE	10943	It is known that the modern life is frequently full of hassles , frustrations , and demands . 	0
PE	10944	Melancholia , the most fatal problem , even leads some people to commit suicide . 	0
PE	10945	Thus , some people have physical problems , such as insomnia and headaches . 	0
PE	10946	From this , it ' s clear that computer has a positive effect on the children . 	1
PE	10947	Following the demonstration of a computer ' s contribution in children ' s study and building skills which are to be used in their career afterwards , it is agreed that computer is a boon to children . 	1
PE	10948	For the above reasons , I believe that stress management is an essential skill for everyone to learn and find their own way to solve their stress . 	1
PE	10949	Firstly , a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses , this is generally known as spam , and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people . 	1
PE	10950	Secondly , advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results . 	0
PE	10951	Therefore , advertising is believed by many , a financial burden to businesses . 	1
PE	10952	In conclusion , after analyzing the pros and cons of advertising , both of the views have strong support , but it is felt that more good comes from advertising than bad . 	1
PE	10953	Thus , the idea that advertising is a positive part of life can be more supported . 	1
PE	10954	However , the warmth of the materials , the heart pine , marble , or the old brick , all those old buildings features call back of our inner peace . 	0
PE	10955	The city is occupied with an abundance of modern houses and and high buildings which make it crowded , and no rooms for people to relax themselves . 	0
PE	10956	However , the preservation of old buildings is a one-way street . 	0
PE	10957	Overall , I believe that the city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity . 	1
PE	10958	In fact , those good endings sometimes are helpful . 	0
PE	10959	So we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding . 	0
PE	10960	But like I said , this kind of behavior won ’ t last long , because someday they will realize the truth . 	0
PE	10961	Some people may be encouraged to do good things . 	0
PE	10962	And if they can , they will be good people no matter how the story ends . 	0
PE	10963	So I suggest we should show people the truth in the stories . 	1
PE	10964	Based on my arguments above , I think movies and TV programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing . 	1
PE	10965	Sometimes , they want an information that can help them in daily life which the internet can provide all of these to people . 	0
PE	10966	For example , a businessman who has no time to watch a television or read a newspaper can receive news and check stock markets easily via the internet . 	0
PE	10967	In my opinion , I agree with the latter because the internet gives daily necessary information , people can gain knowledge and they can explore the world . 	1
PE	10968	First of all , everybody would like to know what is going on around the world in their everyday lives . 	1
PE	10969	Some people believe that several problems occur from an information on the internet . 	0
PE	10970	However , some say that the internet provides a lot of valuable information . 	1
PE	10971	The internet provides a lot of valuable information 	0
PE	10972	In the modern society , internet is considered as one of the most important inventions over the past century . 	0
PE	10973	They cheat young ages because they believe they are immature and they can trap them easily . 	0
PE	10974	To sum up , it makes no difference , people from young ages to old ages are free to make a decision , nonetheless sometimes to prevent some problems coming up for young individuals , it is a good idea to ask parents and adult relatives to give a piece of advice . 	1
PE	10975	Throughout human history , the offspring has always proved its stronger adaptability and advancement than its predecessor . 	0
PE	10976	In addition , people can gain more knowledge by using the internet , the most useful technology in the world . 	1
PE	10977	Many people such as students can take online courses to study at home or they can watch beneficial videos which also teach them knowledge . 	0
PE	10978	Old and young workers 	0
PE	10979	There is no doubt that money has become key ingredient in various walks of our life than before . 	0
PE	10980	Higher school students should be taught how to manage money 	0
PE	10981	We are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place . 	0
PE	10982	To put it in a nutshell , I pen down saying that , technology alone can solve the world ' s environmental problems . 	1
PE	10983	Some people feel that teaching money management skill to teenage students will help them realise the importance of money , while few feel that exposing children to money math at this age may turn fatal . 	0
PE	10984	One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa . 	0
PE	10985	There are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot . 	1
PE	10986	Furthermore , Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030 . 	0
PE	10987	Teaching financial management to juvenile students is always a topic of debate . 	0
PE	10988	If successful , the impact on the world would be monumental . 	0
PE	10989	By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun , it could meet the entire world ' s electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions . 	0
PE	10990	It would mean another industrial revolution . 	0
PE	10991	It would mean energy for schools , hospitals , and homes . 	0
PE	10992	What is more , it is acknowledged that a large number of creational facilities are built in cities . 	0
PE	10993	Children who live in cities have a lot of entertainment . 	1
PE	10994	For instance , in my country the best schools , universities and institutes are located in cities , and todays education is one of the most important parts of our children ' s life . 	0
PE	10995	Therefore , it is a good idea for children to past their first earlier life in the cities . 	1
PE	10996	From my point of view big cities can be a good place for bringing up children . 	1
PE	10997	To begin with , it is undeniable that education is better in big cities in comparison with countrysides . 	0
PE	10998	It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city ? 	0
PE	10999	Nowadays living is possible on every place of the world , but still there are some differences among them . 	0
PE	11000	For example playgrounds , parks , science museums , cinemas etc . However , in countrysides we hardly ever see creational facilities . 	0
PE	11001	Children who live in countrysides most of the time pass their free time in farms . 	0
PE	11002	As the Australia ’ s Great Barrier Reef has shown , the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder , namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat ’ s anchors , dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions . 	0
PE	11003	For this reason , many marine lives have been endangered , in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species . 	0
PE	11004	International tourism is now more common than ever before 	0
PE	11005	The last 50 years have seen a significant increase in the number of tourist traveling worldwide . 	0
PE	11006	While some might think the tourism bring large profit for the destination countries , I would contend that this industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations . 	1
PE	11007	Firstly , it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations . 	0
PE	11008	Take Thailand for example , in the Vietnam War , many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities , these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded , even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximize their profits . 	0
PE	11009	This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism . 	0
PE	11010	Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries . 	1
PE	11011	Secondly , there are clear evidences that tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals . 	0
PE	11012	This plan ability helps me a lot , making me climb to the top rank of the class while finishing everything else . 	0
PE	11013	Yet , in this year , following the suggestion of my roommate , John , I make a to-do list to plan and organize perfectly everything I should get done in the final and hence take every tasks and trivials into control . 	0
PE	11014	Take myself as an example , I used to be overwhelmed by the burden of preparing for the final exam , submitting my paper , and finishing my internship work at the end of each term . 	0
PE	11015	First of all , great planning and organizing ability is able to cause our actions more efficient and productive . 	1
PE	11016	Meanwhile , eliminating meaningless actions . 	0
PE	11017	Therefore , it is essential for people , especially young ones , to possess the ability to plan and organize since it can improve the efficiency and reduce the crisis of our actions . 	1
PE	11018	With the fast rolling wheels of modern society , life becomes more complex and is not easy to handle than in the past . 	0
PE	11019	It is essential to have ability to plan and organize 	0
PE	11020	As we all know , the employees in every company have to create profit as much as they can for their supervisors and complete their assignments perfectly . 	0
PE	11021	Equally important , the capacity to plan and organize also help young people to eliminate the crisis in their actions , which may ruin one ' s whole effort over a very long time . 	1
PE	11022	Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts : where more and more is known about less and less . 	0
PE	11023	Nevertheless , among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life . 	0
PE	11024	True function of a university 	0
PE	11025	Universities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise . 	0
PE	11026	What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for , not the employers , as students are the ones here to seek knowledge . 	0
PE	11027	High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons : a degree that ' s more widely accepted , gain knowledge and insight into an industry , or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field . 	0
PE	11028	However , although I respect the universities ' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause , I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university . 	0
PE	11029	A university , in common sense , is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge . 	1
PE	11030	On the other hand , universities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather . 	0
PE	11031	It is , therefore , not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university , but instead , these must be made available when needed . 	0
PE	11032	To sum up , this new construction has a lot of advantages like new connections between students from different communities , also the new educational equipment will increase the students ' enthusiasm toward studying . 	1
PE	11033	The people living in the neighborhood will be a bit perturbed , but I think this isn ' t a important reason for ceasing the competitions . 	0
PE	11034	So the new high school will be a great addition for my environment . 	1
PE	11035	The only disadvantage is the nosiness of competitions which students will participate , but I think that it isn ' t a big deal . 	1
PE	11036	For instance during the football match the students of different high schools will come and after the competition they will keep in touch . 	0
PE	11037	After classes students and not only the students will get together in building of high school , participate in different competitions . 	0
PE	11038	The only disadvantage is the noisiness of the competitions . 	0
PE	11039	This will increase the social connections of the students . 	0
PE	11040	Because their major in completely involved in physical activities . 	0
PE	11041	In contrast , for an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories , because it really make the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe find new things in their field . 	0
PE	11042	In addition , students choose their major based on their interests . 	0
PE	11043	The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students . 	1
PE	11044	For example when I and my friends want to spend time with each other , we prefer to go out of university to the places where we do not want to be disturbed by any familiar people . 	0
PE	11045	In conclusion , I do not deny the importance of doing sports in the success of university students , but I think both sports and social activities should not receive equal amount of money with libraries and laboratories . 	1
PE	11046	Finally , spending money on social activities looks like wasting money . 	1
PE	11047	For students who want to gather with their friends or want to go out to meet new people , university programs are the last place they would choose . 	0
PE	11048	Although some argue that a meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake , it is proved that many kinds of bean such as soy bean or pea are also comparable protein sources . 	0
PE	11049	This fortifies the fact that a vegetable diet can do good for our health . 	0
PE	11050	Many researchers have convinced that many kinds of vegetable contain antioxydant which can prevent cancer . 	0
PE	11051	Firstly , health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular . 	1
PE	11052	It is clear to me that people avoid eating meat mostly for the sake of their health and relegious aspect . 	1
PE	11053	Some people claim that this is brought about by the care for animal rights issue , others think it is much beyond that . 	0
PE	11054	Recent years , however , has seen a rapid increase in the number of vegetarians . 	0
PE	11055	Meat has served as the main dish in almost every family ' s meals all around the world . 	0
PE	11056	Since the dawn of time , human has considered meat as a fundamental protein sources . 	0
PE	11057	Vegetarianism - why some people are choosing to become vegetarian ? 	0
PE	11058	By way of conclusion , it is my belief that wild animals should be set free from zoos not only because they have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression . 	1
PE	11059	It seems that the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide . 	0
PE	11060	However , I would contend that the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat . 	0
PE	11061	They further point out that the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting . 	0
PE	11062	For instance , housework is very difficult for me , although my husband helps me some of them , but it is my responsibility . 	0
PE	11063	I really don ' t like any of them , however I should do . 	0
PE	11064	This is basic part of the lives . 	0
PE	11065	There may be small or big things , but at last people should accept them , because most of them is about responsibilities . 	0
PE	11066	In personal live , we have some responsibilities towards other people 	0
PE	11067	People should sometimes do things , even though they don ' t enjoy it . 	0
PE	11068	Firstly , most people ' s lives are filled with tasks that they don ' t enjoy doing . 	0
PE	11069	In personal live , we have some responsibilities towards to other people , there is nobody who likes all of these responsibilities . 	1
PE	11070	Moreover , sometimes by doing things helps the people learn about live . 	0
PE	11071	In this essay , the reasons for why I agree that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing will be explored . 	1
PE	11072	Furthermore , it can be replaced by a life sentence . 	1
PE	11073	In conclusion , although capital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community , I firmly object to it because it is absurd and inhumane . 	1
PE	11074	Thus , many people are executed for the crime they did not commit , which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system . 	0
PE	11075	Juries are also humans , they may lack of discretion . 	0
PE	11076	I wish one day this problem would be changed . 	0
PE	11077	To sum up , the transportation is an elementary factor which directly affects to people ’ s living . 	1
PE	11078	And then , the transportation in my hometown is no longer difficult for everyone in this community . 	0
PE	11079	Also , it provides many advantages . 	0
PE	11080	Lastly , having more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars . 	0
PE	11081	The necessary energy will slowly be used up , since people use less their own cars . 	1
PE	11082	For instance , people can save their expenses form gasoline , which nowadays is getting more expensive . 	0
PE	11083	Therefore , a government ' s role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people ' s lives . 	0
PE	11084	That ’ s why it is important to take risks . 	1
PE	11085	In sum , I believe that success and trying new things and taking risks go hand in hand and to achieve success you should consider them . 	1
PE	11086	The more you take risks , the greater your successes will be . 	0
PE	11087	If you don ’ t take any risks , you will have an ordinary life with average successes . 	0
PE	11088	If you want to gain very high profits in investments , you should use great and very high amounts of money in very risky financial decisions and dealings in which you may lose much amount of money . 	0
PE	11089	If you want to achieve a remarkable success in an important exam , you should risk studying all the time and sacrificing your free time and your favorite hobbies . 	0
PE	11090	Both these factors have their own values , and have been discussed in detail below : Competitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently . 	1
PE	11091	Some people think that it is better to make them competitive , while other believes to make them co-operative . 	0
PE	11092	It is undeniable that children have an innocent mind , and they requires a proper guidance at a specific time to make them understand the value of life . 	0
PE	11093	People should create a sense of co-operation in their children 	0
PE	11094	However , those who wants to create a sense of co-operation in their children is a symbol that they want to make them sensible enough in their lives ahead . 	0
PE	11095	For example , MNCs are mainly focusing on a team work , and a person with the competitive mind would be having a difficulty in managing the situation with the team . 	0
PE	11096	This factor will lead them to be successful in their lives ahead , but will also restrict them in many ways . 	0
PE	11097	This factor initially arises from the school , where teacher encourages student to feel more competitive through the grading system , and this is the place where children are trying to get on the top by scoring the highest marks . 	0
PE	11098	As for students , we can get what we want to know from textbooks , webs or teachers . 	0
PE	11099	All of my classmates gave him a rank of AAA , the excellent teacher . 	0
PE	11100	Although professors in a university are basically teachers who do the most important thing , teaching , we cannot ignore one more influential aspect that they are always busy with , doing research . 	0
PE	11101	Should professors doing more research or educating students more ? 	0
PE	11102	A professor means a researcher or an expert of a specific science subject . 	0
PE	11103	In my opinion , a professor should spend more time doing research rather than educating students for a few reasons following . 	1
PE	11104	And then he or she can do better in teaching works . 	0
PE	11105	He or she should always keep the passion in her field so that he or she could push him / herself forward all the time . 	1
PE	11106	He is also the one who gave us inspiration and taught us the way to study more efficient by ourselves . 	0
PE	11107	For instance , the most impressive professor during my studying in university is Mr . Yang who keeps in researching and reading . 	0
PE	11108	I feel that after working out , I am easily to fall asleep . 	0
PE	11109	Exercising not only reduce my stress but also make me get a good health . 	0
PE	11110	These problem sometime make me hard to fall asleep because it make me stress . 	0
PE	11111	Thus , after work , I always do exercise , and jogging is my favorite sport . 	0
PE	11112	Second , another way that is perfectly work for everyone to reduce the stress is exercise . 	1
PE	11113	For instance , I alway have many things in my mind such as a difficult of my work that I have to finish in time . 	0
PE	11114	I could enjoy listening music without thinking of people around me . 	0
PE	11115	Consequently , I feel happy when I listen music . 	0
PE	11116	These make me stress . 	0
PE	11117	So that I always listen music from my mp3 player . 	0
PE	11118	If he lives with his parents for longer time , they have more chances to share the feelings , exercise , and travel together . 	0
PE	11119	All memories become priceless treasure as time passes by . 	0
PE	11120	Students can gain more knowledge in every different subjects thy study . 	0
PE	11121	For instance , university students who study business are also know history of the world . 	0
PE	11122	Furthermore , students not only gain knowledge but they also have more experience because they will meet new friends and teachers . 	0
PE	11123	Hence , they all can share opinion and knowledge to one another . 	0
PE	11124	Finally , students who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career . 	1
PE	11125	This is because graduates can work in various kind of works which they can select a job they prefer . 	0
PE	11126	For example , students will choose a career that they want including the job with high salary include . 	0
PE	11127	Moreover , bachelors can earn lots of money by working in other fields due to their knowledge . 	0
PE	11128	In concluding , learning several subjects in universities is better than specialize in one subject because it makes students have more chance to gain knowledge to use in their lives and opportunity to choose their own future . 	1
PE	11129	Unfortunately , many governments restrict the artists . 	0
PE	11130	I am the kind of person who has only one or two close friends , and I am fully content that I have such nice friends . 	0
PE	11131	The young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age . 	0
PE	11132	When having a job , it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown . 	0
PE	11133	I believe that with the help of our family , we can achieve success quite easily . 	1
PE	11134	In a word , our parents and other family members can help us a lot in our life . 	1
PE	11135	What they want is help their child to make a progress . 	0
PE	11136	Besides , parents can told their children as many as they can . 	0
PE	11137	Hence , people and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime ' s categories such as theft , robbery , murder , rape , vandalism , arson . 	0
PE	11138	Obviously , Those are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence . 	1
PE	11139	In conclusion , from the above views , although being armed with guns in the police force is necessary , it will bring the higher level of violence . 	1
PE	11140	Additionally , the government should to impose strict laws in carrying weapons as well as give professional training to them in order to avoid any influence on civilians ' lives . 	0
PE	11141	The reason why most people oppose to zoos is that in some of them the animals are not very well taken care of and they do not have good and clean facilities . 	1
PE	11142	This is mostly true but does not relate to the purpose of zoos . 	0
PE	11143	In the present there is a lack of respect for animals . 	0
PE	11144	Being able to see the animals in real life and learning facts about them would help by making people aware of the importance of animals and the respect they deserve . 	0
PE	11145	It would be great if every zoo kept the animals in perfect conditions , but regardless of the condition , zoos are very useful . 	1
PE	11146	I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions . 	1
PE	11147	This overwhelming crisis is prompting delayering and reduction of workers . 	0
PE	11148	As a result , people are focusing on doing several jobs or gaining further qualification to secure their economic condition . 	1
PE	11149	A full time job with a steady income was enough for a potential employee to support himself and his family . 	0
PE	11150	But with the recent recession , almost all the countries all over the world are seeing significant economic downfall . 	0
PE	11151	People usually tend to have a single career as a means of living . 	0
PE	11152	However , a modern trend reveals that new generations are more interested to perform several jobs and also would like to gain multiple higher educational certificates in order to earn more and to gain financial security . 	0
PE	11153	People are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification 	0
PE	11154	The career itself became the motto of living since the beginning of industrialization in the late 19th century . 	0
PE	11155	The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system . 	0
PE	11156	Moreover , the arrival of technology has also been playing a major role promoting further unemployment . 	0
PE	11157	The official term of it is named " Technological Unemployment " . 	0
PE	11158	Lastly , experiences are also change to plan for my future life . 	1
PE	11159	For example , I read about saving money for my retire is a good plan for my life . 	0
PE	11160	Secondly , Some experiences could teach me the way to take care of myself . 	1
PE	11161	For instance , reading and listening the news about choosing a good diet are the way to keep myself are more healthy . 	0
PE	11162	Which ways are shortest and which ways are less consume my time . 	0
PE	11163	I could find a better way to solve problems . 	0
PE	11164	So that , I can have a good health . 	0
PE	11165	This experience teach me to aware my health . 	0
PE	11166	Thus , I am always buy a quality food such as organic food . 	0
PE	11167	This food are not have chemical . 	0
PE	11168	In today ' s world , having and raising children can be a very difficult task for families , the smallest component of the society . 	0
PE	11169	Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded , they may feel upset and not to be a good person . 	0
PE	11170	But in fact , the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not . 	0
PE	11171	And I think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies . 	0
PE	11172	So if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded , they may think it will be true in the real world . 	1
PE	11173	They will be misleading by those movies . 	0
PE	11174	And they may act like good people in order to get reward . 	0
PE	11175	But now many people , including me , have been tired with it . 	0
PE	11176	I don ’ t want to see the same kind of ending again and again . 	0
PE	11177	So we can ’ t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs . 	1
PE	11178	Even in the real world , good people can get a bad ending sometimes . 	0
PE	11179	Even in some cases , people compose a message with only emoticons ( the expressions by face created by service providers ) , which means there is no room for writing or typing texts . 	0
PE	11180	Moreover , it is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying , writing assignments . 	0
PE	11181	If that tendency continues at a rapid pace , written language may face up to a real problem about its stand . 	0
PE	11182	In conclusion , we cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity . 	1
PE	11183	They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways . 	0
PE	11184	The popularity of email and text messaging , as a result , leads to the losing of written language ' s position . 	1
PE	11185	People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities . 	0
PE	11186	The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form . 	0
PE	11187	Nevertheless , educators and individuals themselves , especially the youths should pay ore attention to this matter so that we can take advantages of the new language along with preserving the traditional one . 	0
PE	11188	Earning money for living becomes more difficult , living healthy in such places is getting harder also . 	1
PE	11189	In conclusion , I believe that life in big cities can have negative effects on people ' s health . 	1
PE	11190	Furthermore , living in such cities also means living in high crime rate areas . 	1
PE	11191	Unemployed workers or school dropouts can easily commit crime from petty offence to felony such as burglary , pickpocketing , trickery , vandalism , smuggling or even murder . 	0
PE	11192	Thus , both government and individual should take steps to diminish the consequences involved . 	0
PE	11193	As mentioned in the second paragraph , how can a man live happily if he is unhealthy ? 	0
PE	11194	The first reason why the father ' s role should be equal to the mother ' s role is the nature of parantage . 	1
PE	11195	While mother ' s role is essential in a child ' s life , I completely agree with the idea that fatherhood is a as vital part of a healty parantage as much as motherhood . 	1
PE	11196	For example , in a traditional Turkish family , while a mother has a sincere and thoughtful approach to the child , a father role must be present as authoritarian and conversative to raise a well-behaved child . 	0
PE	11197	One of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation . 	0
PE	11198	As you can see , studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job . 	1
PE	11199	In school , we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them . 	0
PE	11200	This can be done in school . 	0
PE	11201	For example , if someone wants to become a good industrial engineer , he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job . 	0
PE	11202	If we study them hard , we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future . 	0
PE	11203	I think that No factor is important enough by itself to succeed in any situations . 	0
PE	11204	The ability to relate well to people is more important 	0
PE	11205	I believe that both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job for following reasons : We need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job . 	1
PE	11206	We should consider many factors and choose the best of them . 	0
PE	11207	In my view , the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child ' s characteristics . 	0
PE	11208	Moreover , advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers . 	1
PE	11209	Take Coca cola for an example , this drinking firm is well-known as one of companies invested a major part of their money in advertising . 	0
PE	11210	Discuss both harms and good of advertising and give your opinion 	0
PE	11211	On these days , with the assistance of advertisement , people easily purchase the best products with detailed information and instruction for their requirement . 	0
PE	11212	Although some people claim that the advantages of advertising are outweigh the advantages , I believe that advertisement bring more benefits than harms to our lives . 	1
PE	11213	On the one hand , it is clear that most advertisements so exaggerate the quality of their products that they often ignore some negative effects of what they sell . 	0
PE	11214	In addition to this , all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods . 	1
PE	11215	For example , some kinds of shampoo , namely Sunsilk , Clear , Dove are publicized as magic items to recreate injured hair with the number of other benefits . 	0
PE	11216	However , the fact is that not all customers are satisfied with what they bought under the introduction from advertisement . 	0
PE	11217	On the other hand , it is undeniable fact that advertising market gives lots of working opportunities from producers , writers to models and cameramen for all of people as long as their qualification adapt to the demands . 	1
PE	11218	In my opinion , we are living in a society that puts a significant importance to gender equality in every aspect of the life , including relationships . 	0
PE	11219	The second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today . 	1
PE	11220	I will give reasons to support my opinion . 	0
PE	11221	Instead , all of the couple duties are performed equally and interchangeably by individuals . 	0
PE	11222	And also dancing to entertain people . 	0
PE	11223	For example , some culture people believe that they dance in order to sacrifice to their god so they will be get a happy life . 	0
PE	11224	First , dancing are significant part of culture that could show to something that people believe . 	0
PE	11225	In every country , people do dance for fun , for entertrain , and for decrease a stress . 	0
PE	11226	Dancing plays an important role in a culture . 	0
PE	11227	For instance , a family formed by a woman with a housewife role who looks after the home and takes care of children and a man who brings money home can not be seen anymore in today ' s society . 	0
PE	11228	Computers have made human life more easy , convenient and lightning fast . 	0
PE	11229	They are used in space programs , wars , hospitals , schools and so on . 	0
PE	11230	Right from flying planes to sending a small document , computers are needed . 	0
PE	11231	The whole world is dependent on computers , without which , the world will go back hundreds of years . 	1
PE	11232	Computers - use , future prospects and over-dependence 	0
PE	11233	It is sure that advertising always makes the products so tempting , regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body . 	0
PE	11234	However , advertising is not the only information source for people . 	0
PE	11235	Since having these products shows their status , the quality obviously is not relatively important . 	0
PE	11236	However , despite the fact that advertisements can be falseful and exaggerated , it is also true that it plays and important role economically . 	1
PE	11237	They penetrate into people ' s life , affecting people ' s choices in different things . 	0
PE	11238	Therefore , it comes to the debate whether advertising has positive influences on people ' s life . 	0
PE	11239	The advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits 	0
PE	11240	Advertising is becoming part of our modern society . 	0
PE	11241	First of all , advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit . 	1
PE	11242	The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people ' s concept of wholesome diets and self-control . 	0
PE	11243	Some people believe that these various advertisements get people to buy products that are unnecessary and only look good on television . 	1
PE	11244	In my opinion , the advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits . 	1
PE	11245	During running for 20 Kilometers in a marathon running tournament 2014 , I saw some people stopped running while the others fought until their last minute . 	0
PE	11246	At some moment , my body was telling me to stop but the choice that I made was on the contrary . 	0
PE	11247	Keep trying and never stop working for your goals 	0
PE	11248	" Keep running ! , " shouted from my heart but my legs can hardly move . 	0
PE	11249	Firstly , committing to our goal helps creating personal worth . 	1
PE	11250	For example , I realized the true potential of my body and mind as I decided to train myself hard . 	0
PE	11251	I did not stop and won a medal goals in my life at the age of nearly thirty . 	0
PE	11252	From this experience , I believe that a person should keep trying for his goals . 	1
PE	11253	Even if I were not to win this medal , I acknowledged the great amount of my endeavor as I could keep my tired legs running . 	0
PE	11254	Secondly , one who learns the great difficulty will become stronger . 	1
PE	11255	To sum up , I am strongly convinced that pets deserve to be treated like family members because of all the reasons mentioned above , namely they are our friends and they can be useful in many situations . 	1
PE	11256	As far as I am concerned , this proposal is beneficial more to the society . 	0
PE	11257	Recently , some people argue that government should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities . 	1
PE	11258	How to allocate governmental budget efficiently has always been a hot topic of discussion among the public . 	0
PE	11259	Government shouldn ' t put money on building theaters or sports stadiums 	0
PE	11260	Entertaining facilities such as cinemas , theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented . 	1
PE	11261	Therefore , providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government . 	1
PE	11262	As a matter of fact , an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals , whereas a physical damaged person , resulting from the lack of medical treatment , may no longer participate in any sports games . 	0
PE	11263	Taking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums . 	0
PE	11264	My opinion is based on creating memories with parents , saving money , and taking advice from parents . 	0
PE	11265	First of all , one of the most significant upsides is that the young adult can have more experience with his parents . 	0
PE	11266	The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market , which should not be interfered by government . 	0
PE	11267	Their existences are based on their marketing strategies , the condition of facilities and the volume of audience . 	0
PE	11268	Learning to be independent is essential for young adults 	0
PE	11269	Learning to be independent is essential for young adults . 	0
PE	11270	However , how early the children leave their parents is a difficult issue . 	0
PE	11271	In my point of view , staying with the parents for longer time does more benefits than disadvantages to the young adult . 	1
PE	11272	It is a positive encouragement for many more talented people to contribute to the world of athletics and entertainment , giving us awesome performances to enjoy . 	1
PE	11273	In conclusion , high salary for athletes is what they deserve in accordance with their own achievements and also a guarantee for quality performances . 	1
PE	11274	Second , such high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete ' s great performances . 	1
PE	11275	That ' s why the richest athletes usually correspond to the greatest athletes in their fields , namely Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods . 	0
PE	11276	They shall reap within their high salaries . 	0
PE	11277	Most of us only see the luxurious side of a rich athlete and ignore how may difficulties they ' ve gone through and how much cost they ' ve thrown into investing themselves . 	0
PE	11278	Some people might argue that the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair . 	1
PE	11279	In other words , if they are not paid high enough in order to conform to their performances , there might not be such brilliant performances for us to be amazed . 	0
PE	11280	Fairness is not about equal payments for everyone , but equal chances to acquire the same goal or accomplishment . 	0
PE	11281	However , in my opinion , as long as everyone has equal chances to pursue his / her dreams and careers , that would be fair . 	0
PE	11282	These factors affect people who work or study from home . 	1
PE	11283	Following both the point of views , the option of working or studying from home is thought to provide more benefits than drawbacks . 	1
PE	11284	Thus , the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home , are obvious . 	1
PE	11285	On the other hand , one part of the society , has doubt over the productivity of people who prefers to work or study from home . 	0
PE	11286	They save the travelling time to Universities and utilize that time on their studies . 	0
PE	11287	In a busy city like Tokyo , students waste a lot of time in travelling . 	0
PE	11288	Teachers think that students get affected too as they can not clear their doubts in study topics instantly . 	0
PE	11289	Due to this they lag in their studies . 	0
PE	11290	Many employers argue that once an employee works from isolation , he or she spends a lot of time in communication via phone or email with colleagues . 	0
PE	11291	This harms an employee ' s deliverable . 	0
PE	11292	I think TV programs are among the popular topics in every day talk as well as a great time for gathering . 	1
PE	11293	In addition Modern TV has smart system that let you be connected with people . 	1
PE	11294	First , it ' s true watching TV take a lot of your day , nevertheless it makes people meet and start a conversation about what they watch at other times like weather forecast and sport programs . 	1
PE	11295	Second , people like having meals while they are watching TV . 	1
PE	11296	Television destroys communication among friends and family 	0
PE	11297	Television is one of the greatest innovations that we use every day . 	0
PE	11298	Besides , watching television has some cons and at the same time has very good pros . 	0
PE	11299	However , while some people argue that TV has devastated communication among friends and families , I believe it has done the opposite . 	0
PE	11300	Families usually tend to watch television either with each other or friends . 	1
PE	11301	For example my friends and I used to sit together and enjoy watching movies using VHS player at nights . 	0
PE	11302	No matter how appealing the advertisements are , we should be able to make the decision on our own . 	0
PE	11303	Otherwise the market may be monopolistic , and the price as well as the choice will not be so selective . 	0
PE	11304	The power of advertising maybe over-rated , we can not deny that the final decision is on the hands of us consumers . 	1
PE	11305	They introduce new products , and provide various choices , not to mention they are often visually enjoyable , since they aim to grab your attention . 	0
PE	11306	Advertising also helps to keep prices at reasonable levels , creates a fair environment for commercial competition . 	0
PE	11307	Through million years of hunting , especially in recent centuries with the innovation of rifle and dynamite , people have killed many animals and even have made some kinds of them become extinct . 	0
PE	11308	Moreover , people , suffering from the population pressure , are expanding their living area ; consequently , the living area of other species narrowed . 	0
PE	11309	This narrowing of living region is pushing many creatures to the brink of extinction . 	0
PE	11310	All in all , from discussed reasons , we can conclude that human activity are gradually destroy the Earth since it is polluting the Earth environment , depleting the resource and imperiling other species ' lives . 	1
PE	11311	It is rare times when people can learn about this country . 	0
PE	11312	It really help to alleviate the tension . 	1
PE	11313	Besides easing tensions , an international sporting event also helps fans release patriotic emotions in a safe way . 	1
PE	11314	When they garther together to encourage their team , they will show their patriotic emotions . 	0
PE	11315	Regardless of the competition between teams , their emotions are always released in a safe way due to the sole passion of the sport . 	0
PE	11316	Moreover , all fans know that a sport event will attract the attention of whole the world and a lot of public media . 	0
PE	11317	They will try to create a beautiful image about their land and people . 	0
PE	11318	In Olympic Beijing 2008 , Chinese tried thier best to bring the world a spectacular image about their country . 	0
PE	11319	First of all , foreigners came here always received the support of friendly volunteers who were young students . 	0
PE	11320	They were welcomed by each Chinese hospitality , beauty in each cities . 	0
PE	11321	Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services . 	0
PE	11322	They further point out that the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money . 	0
PE	11323	By way of conclusion , I believe that modern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases ; however , the have-nots cannot be ignored simply because they couldn ' t afford it . 	1
PE	11324	Consequently , people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies . 	1
PE	11325	So we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal . 	1
PE	11326	They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations . 	0
PE	11327	Female candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer . 	0
PE	11328	Finally , life becoming more stressful due to some recent problems such as traffic gam , traffic accidents and others . 	0
PE	11329	Given these evidences , it can be seen that people are facing up with many recently appeared illnesses due to aforementioned reasons . 	1
PE	11330	Many people , for example , are suffering from allergy because of these gasses . 	0
PE	11331	Secondly , foods with a low quality such as fast foods , junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively . 	0
PE	11332	For instance , there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only . 	0
PE	11333	Thus , these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution . 	0
PE	11334	In order to solve these problems , alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively . 	1
PE	11335	With regard to the former , alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal . 	0
PE	11336	What is worse , traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result , it leads to an increase of traffic accidents . 	0
PE	11337	Thus , the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented . 	1
PE	11338	Since bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses , it is a better form to protect environment than automobile . 	0
PE	11339	As for the latter point , the introduction of international laws can be also effective . 	0
PE	11340	For example , rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries . 	0
PE	11341	This system is that at the corner of each district , the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee . 	0
PE	11342	Last but not least , nowadays , there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work . 	1
PE	11343	Therefore , it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better . 	1
PE	11344	These women will set a good example for their children . 	0
PE	11345	These things in turn will make them more confident , independent . 	0
PE	11346	In conclusion , a well-organized home does not need the housewife ' s presence the whole day long and married women could go to work in order to enjoy the working life outside the home . 	1
PE	11347	Besides the gorvernment ' s policies on limited families and their husbands ' sharing in the housework , many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women . 	0
PE	11348	First of all , more and more people have the opportunity to receive education from university . 	0
PE	11349	Since our parents receive better education than our grandparents did , they can provide more advices and helps in our career . 	1
PE	11350	The opportunity to receive education from university 	0
PE	11351	There are many factors that contribute to one ' s success . 	0
PE	11352	However , which factor is the most influential one is open to debate . 	0
PE	11353	Some people believe that nowadays the assitance from family is quite a essential factor in one ' s success . 	0
PE	11354	It seems that one can achieve success more easily with the help from his or her family . 	1
PE	11355	I agree with this statement . 	0
PE	11356	In my opinion , family plays a more important role in helping one to pursuit success . 	1
PE	11357	There are a couple of reasons . 	0
PE	11358	In conclusion , I would rather classify myself in the proponents of globalization as a speeding factor of global progress . 	1
PE	11359	I think it is more likely to solve the problems of the world rather than intensifying them . 	0
PE	11360	Because , classroom could provide real actual example to make students more understand in their subject . 	0
PE	11361	Besides , classroom courses are also provide students to learn social skill . 	0
PE	11362	From personal level , it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations . 	0
PE	11363	However , sacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences . 	1
PE	11364	This is because they have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities . 	0
PE	11365	Firstly , fresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation . 	0
PE	11366	Compared with aged staffs , younger employees are often physically stronger and energetic which enables them to carry out heavy workload to meet the deadline . 	0
PE	11367	Secondly , having a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency . 	0
PE	11368	Nowadays the discussion about whether the businesses are supposed to prescribe the retirement age at fifty-five to offer more job vacancies for younger generation has become a controversy . 	0
PE	11369	Early retirement for 55 + employees to help younger people 	0
PE	11370	Admittedly , encouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty-five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits . 	1
PE	11371	Some believe that is a perfect attempt to support the young , others claim that this is not the case . 	0
PE	11372	I hold this belief due to the improvement of students ' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards . 	1
PE	11373	These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time . 	0
PE	11374	To conclude , it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students . 	1
PE	11375	However , in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims . 	0
PE	11376	By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves . 	1
PE	11377	And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people . 	0
PE	11378	Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being . 	0
PE	11379	Finally one night , having fun with his irresponsible friend in his luxuries car , he crashed a truck and died . 	0
PE	11380	Not only did he cause lots of damage to the society property , but also bring sorry to his family . 	0
PE	11381	I found that I should manage the way that I spend money . 	0
PE	11382	From then I learned to be economical and now I have every thing I wanted . 	0
PE	11383	Another aspect of learning children to manage their money is on the finance of the family . 	0
PE	11384	If parents get the children all they wanted , they would be run out of their money for their essential needs . 	0
PE	11385	Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money , when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity . 	1
PE	11386	As a case in point , I had a friend to had a rich and prosperous family , his parent gave him everything he demanded from his childhood . 	0
PE	11387	He became an arrogant person who could not stand on his feet and always asked for money . 	0
PE	11388	His parent tried a lot and hired some experts to learn him manage his financial and carrier life , but unfortunately it was useless . 	0
PE	11389	For example , Chanda Kochhar , who is the CEO of India ' s second largest bank called ICICI bank and prominently awarded as the country ' s most powerful female head in business sector . 	0
PE	11390	In addition , due to increasing exposure on current affairs and knowledge on cutting-edge technological developments , female graduates are more willing to take huge responsibilities in their workplace , despite its intensive stress and pressure . 	0
PE	11391	In today ' s context , education is the most significant factor which ultimately determines one ' s future . 	0
PE	11392	Every student either male or female should be given equal opportunity 	0
PE	11393	There appear to be various reasons often strike in my mind in support of this position . 	0
PE	11394	In my personal opinion , I am totally agreed with the view that there should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university courses . 	1
PE	11395	Nowadays , both male and female students are equally competitive to each other and deserve to produce impressive results in various field of education . 	0
PE	11396	To begin with , judging student ' s skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular . 	1
PE	11397	Furthermore , female students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops , unlike previous generation females . 	1
PE	11398	In India , for example , female students are more often likely to grab more number of top scorer positions in every year higher secondary school examinations . 	0
PE	11399	In this sense , people with lower level of education have more proneness to be attracted in such isms . 	0
PE	11400	For example , most of the terroristic groups try to attract uneducated people , because the person with better education has a wider outlook , which will allow no brainwash . 	0
PE	11401	As a result , they can be proselytized into bad isms . 	0
PE	11402	Moreover , these people will not have an access to a good education . 	0
PE	11403	To begin with , children from poorer families are prone to have bad habits such as : crime , thievery and thuggery . 	1
PE	11404	However , I completely disagree with this position . 	0
PE	11405	According to some people , child who is brought up in less well-off family is more quick-witted and can tackle with an adult life problems better than who is from affluent ones . 	0
PE	11406	Children from poorer families are more successful in the future life . 	0
PE	11407	Secondly , children from rich families have better skills on how to use money , because they use it a lot of times . 	1
PE	11408	Nevertheless , people who are born in well-off families have access to good education , which will have a positive impact on their later life . 	1
PE	11409	Common belief that a jury should obtain all information regarding a suspect has fostered some lawyers to protest against the current rules in those two countries . 	0
PE	11410	Many people hold the opinion that past behaviour determines the future actions , which could be the main reason to support the idea of revealing the record to the jury . 	1
PE	11411	Jury must have access to criminals ' past records 	0
PE	11412	Courts of many countries provide a jury with the history of a defendant , except those of the UK and Australia . 	0
PE	11413	Nevertheless , in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience , the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only . 	1
PE	11414	For instance , a defendant with number of past crimes has more chance to be found guilty compared to a person with no or lighter criminal record . 	0
PE	11415	We must acknowledge that complete data concerning the history of a sued person creates more opportunity for jury members to build an overall picture of defendant ' s personality . 	0
PE	11416	Furthermore , past record might be useful to decide whether a person was able to perform a certain type of crime when it concerns serious crimes , such as kidnapping or a murder . 	0
PE	11417	Innocent suspects , eventually , can face unfair juridical decision and pay twice for their previous inadequate actions . 	0
PE	11418	In conclusion , I am skeptical about disclosing the defendant ' s history to the jury , with intention to avoid subjective and probable inaccurate verdict . 	1
PE	11419	The custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture . 	0
PE	11420	When people migrate to a new country , they are likely to suffer the culture shock , because of the difference between two cultures . 	0
PE	11421	On one hand , it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country , if they follow the new customs . 	1
PE	11422	On the other hand , keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination . 	1
PE	11423	As a result , people understand the culture , and then they adapt to the new country . 	0
PE	11424	Youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis . 	0
PE	11425	Fortunately , some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol , cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries . 	0
PE	11426	We come across with ads almost everywhere and everyday . 	0
PE	11427	Some people argue that companies by advertising their goods or services spend their money for nothing . 	0
PE	11428	Society should ban all forms of the advertising 	0
PE	11429	It is no secret that advertising become inseparable part of our modern life . 	0
PE	11430	Society does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers . 	1
PE	11431	First of all , I do support the idea that advertising alcohol , cigarettes , goods and services with adult content should be prohibited because these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children . 	1
PE	11432	Other critics say that ads have no purpose , they only cause damages to society and all forms of advertising should be banned . 	0
PE	11433	On my part I would like to solve this issue on a different way . 	0
PE	11434	It has become essential for a person to learn at least one foreign language as one do interacts with foreigners once in a lifetime and learning a foreign langauge adds on to a person skill-set as well . 	0
PE	11435	Others believe that they are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention . 	0
PE	11436	In my opinion , we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment . 	1
PE	11437	Should animals be free or live in zoos ? 	0
PE	11438	Many people state that zoos are a great asset to animals . 	0
PE	11439	Skills which help them live and survive in their residing areas . 	0
PE	11440	When we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with , they begin to loose those in-born instincts . 	0
PE	11441	Many scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals . 	1
PE	11442	Firstly , like we , human beings , animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts . 	0
PE	11443	Hence , when they are released or in the worst case , when they escape , they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate . 	0
PE	11444	In addition to the previous point , various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care . 	1
PE	11445	They kept researching new technology and became successful at a very young age . 	1
PE	11446	Nonetheless , with the development of technology , increasingly more young people become obsessed with high-tech products . 	0
PE	11447	In comfortable conditions , children may be satisfied with the world around them and refuse to make a change . 	0
PE	11448	Recently , there is a very creative advertisements of a soft drink product on TV . 	0
PE	11449	When the consumers are impressed by the way a product is advertised , they can be convinced to consider that the product is a need in some cases . 	0
PE	11450	However , it is not sufficient in itself . 	0
PE	11451	The most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product is through advertising . 	1
PE	11452	Everyday , companies offer a huge number of different products to consumers . 	0
PE	11453	Advertisements affects on consumer goods 	0
PE	11454	Therefore , advertisers push the limits of creativity to dispose the consumers to purchase the product . 	1
PE	11455	We are mainly introduced to products through advertisements . 	0
PE	11456	In my opinion , advertising is the major reason for high sales of a product for several reasons . 	1
PE	11457	The product also should satisfy the needs of the consumers . 	0
PE	11458	Environmental protection and economic developments might be the biggest issues in the 21st century . 	0
PE	11459	Environmental protection vs Economic developments 	0
PE	11460	However , since the budget and the recourse are limited , governments must choose between these two issues . 	0
PE	11461	They are both important because they are vital to human ' s future and welfare . 	0
PE	11462	The following are reasons why . 	0
PE	11463	In my opinion , I believe that tackling down environmental problems is of the first priority rather than economic developments . 	1
PE	11464	All the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one . 	0
PE	11465	First , environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments . 	1
PE	11466	Just like a man that needs a healthy body , all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well . 	0
PE	11467	Without Earth , whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain because we will all perish as she ' s gone . 	0
PE	11468	It is hoped that people will continue to use internet to work or study and improve on the disadvantages into the foreseeable future . 	0
PE	11469	Cultural events such as exhibitions and theatre plays can enrich one ' s and widen his horizons , things which aren ' t offered by small towns . 	1
PE	11470	Another thing that put big cities in front of small towns is the facilitates and services it contains which support and improve the quality of its inhabitants ' lives , hospitals , advanced medical facilities can satisfy one ' s need of medical safety . 	1
PE	11471	Continuous technological and economical development in modern world created great differences between cities , a difference that is clearly visible in the size of various cities . 	0
PE	11472	Living in big cities or living in small towns 	0
PE	11473	This diversities in cities allowed for more difference in people ' s preferences for where to live . 	0
PE	11474	From cities with more that 20 million people to small towns inhabited by only hundreds of people . 	0
PE	11475	First of all , I find the excitement of big cities to be attractive , living in a dynamic environment can turn into a very rich experience that sharpens one ' s personality and open one ' s eyes on the real world . 	1
PE	11476	For me , I prefer to live in bigger cities than in small ones , this personal attitude is the result of many factors . 	1
PE	11477	For me , this lifestyles is very attractive and is considered a huge advantage of big cities compared with the constant , slow paced life styles of small towns . 	0
PE	11478	Life in big cities cities gives one new challenges every day , let it be deciding which restaurant to go to or deciding which company to work for . 	0
PE	11479	It is widely known that the press provide the public with criminal content in order to increase newspaper circulation and TV rating . 	0
PE	11480	Personally , I believe such details should be strictly censored , if not banned altogether . 	1
PE	11481	Nowadays , the print as well as the electronic media tend to dedicate large amounts of airtime and space to detailed reports about crimes . 	0
PE	11482	Detailed description of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society 	0
PE	11483	The potential market in those poor countries , most of which has a huge population , is also a thing worth mentioning . 	0
PE	11484	By building a good relationship with them , wealthy nations can not only broaden their global market , but also facilitate future international commerce . 	0
PE	11485	Consequently , a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased , exaggerated or fraudulent , which only result to terrorize communities and leave law-aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes . 	1
PE	11486	These days the primary purpose of journalists covering the details of criminal acts is , more often than that , to boost newspaper circulations and TV ratings . 	0
PE	11487	Compassion , a virtue preached in almost all religions from Buddhism to Mohammedanism , is what distinguishes us human beings from animals . 	0
PE	11488	Economically speaking , such aid could also create a win-win situation . 	1
PE	11489	Most importantly , particular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes because they have already suffered greatly for what they have experienced . 	1
PE	11490	For developed nations , new medical problems may very well arise from the work in underdeveloped nations ; thus related research is conducted accordingly to conquer the problem , promoting the development of the pharmaceutical industry . 	0
PE	11491	Should wealthy nations support poor ones ? 	0
PE	11492	Whether wealthy nations should take responsibilities to help poorer ones , by means of providing infrastructures , or remain bystander of the global poverty , is an issue of controversy . 	0
PE	11493	Personally I think , as the privileged minority , wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor . 	1
PE	11494	In terms of ethics , it is inhumane to watch one ' s fellowman struggle against famine and poverty without doing anything to help , especially when the onlooker takes no effort to do so . 	1
PE	11495	We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart . 	0
PE	11496	They opine that now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back . 	0
PE	11497	They argue that it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment . 	0
PE	11498	Some people say that if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment . 	1
PE	11499	On the other hand there are people who say that technology alone could save the environment . 	1
PE	11500	If people don ' t use air conditioners , automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us , then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment . 	0
PE	11501	It is irrefutable that progress in technology leads to environmental problems . 	0
PE	11502	Can technology alone solve the world ' s environmental problems ? 	0
PE	11503	In the following paragraphs , I intend to discuss both viewpoints . 	0
PE	11504	Some individuals are of the opinion that if people live a simple life and do not use the things that technology has brought us then these problems can be solved whereas others opine that only technology can solve these problems . 	0
PE	11505	Back in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car . 	0
PE	11506	It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings . 	1
PE	11507	Finally , with savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams . 	0
PE	11508	He could not afford the maintenance so he had to sell it . 	0
PE	11509	For instance , I made a month-long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend . 	0
PE	11510	Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished . 	1
PE	11511	Considering all the above mentioned arguments , from my point of view there is no other choice than saving money for some time . 	1
PE	11512	Without our savings we could not have pursued our long-time dream . 	0
PE	11513	People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want . 	0
PE	11514	Especially , thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging ( SMS ) , it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information , even to many people at the same time . 	0
PE	11515	Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness , difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information . 	0
PE	11516	However , email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above . 	0
PE	11517	First of all , it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging , which answers to the question of their great popularity . 	1
PE	11518	Before email and mobile phone , human beings communicated by meeting directly , sending letters or later , calling from home phones . 	0
PE	11519	With this situation , some people believe that they may be factors decreasing the position of written language . 	1
PE	11520	I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means . 	0
PE	11521	Email and text messaging threats written language 	0
PE	11522	The introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication . 	0
PE	11523	Humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit ? 	0
PE	11524	Man has dominated all his fellow beings on earth because of his superior brain . 	0
PE	11525	He has domesticated a large number of animals and birds and makes use of them to make life easier and convenient for himself . 	0
PE	11526	Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs , while others are concerned that animals should not be misused . 	0
PE	11527	This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication . 	0
PE	11528	Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as , cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them . 	1
PE	11529	Likewise , other animals such as , horses , cattles and donkeys for farming , agriculture and as a mode of transportation . 	0
PE	11530	Many people keep pets like dogs and cats , trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples . 	0
PE	11531	They are kept for security purposes in houses . 	0
PE	11532	On the other hand , many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits . 	1
PE	11533	For example , the cell phone , which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance , now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications . 	0
PE	11534	In conclusion , as I believe that consumers should consider major needs when they purchase goods , high sales are obviously a reflection of the powerful advertisements . 	1
PE	11535	They make the product preferable . 	1
PE	11536	Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well-known product . 	1
PE	11537	Also , the more an advertisement of a product takes place in mass media , the more popular the product becomes . 	0
PE	11538	As a result of this , the number of that product being sold will increases . 	0
PE	11539	The story delivers a desired call to drink that soft drink that people tend to drink when the weather is too hot . 	0
PE	11540	Considering this fact , advertisements have undeniable affects on the society about the product being advertised . 	0
PE	11541	However , it also has to be affordable for the consumer . 	0
PE	11542	When a product is commonly used , it becomes trustworthy for the society , no matter what quality it is . 	0
PE	11543	Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product . 	0
PE	11544	Firstly , celebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans . 	0
PE	11545	Nevertheless , I believe that other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments . 	1
PE	11546	If they continue to behave in such a way , it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work . 	0
PE	11547	For example , some movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media , thereby gaining the public attention . 	0
PE	11548	This is detrimental to study and work ethics and habits . 	0
PE	11549	Consequently , the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status . 	1
PE	11550	Some people think that celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyle rather than the work they do . 	0
PE	11551	Some celebrities misguide young people& some guide them in right direction 	0
PE	11552	It is true that some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public . 	0
PE	11553	While I agree this will bring negative impacts on the younger generation , this is not necessarily the case for those celebrities who are ambitious in their jobs . 	1
PE	11554	Therefore , this kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance . 	0
PE	11555	This means that people understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results . 	0
PE	11556	Take Michael Jackson as an example , his works are widely spread around the world , and have been extremely welcomed by the younger generation . 	0
PE	11557	Secondly , other celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career . 	0
PE	11558	In summary , although some celebrities misguide young people by showing their external wealth and appearance , other celebrities do lead young people in the right direction . 	1
PE	11559	His songs spread the idea that people should care about each other , which suggests to young people how to become a good member of society . 	0
PE	11560	The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society . 	1
PE	11561	In my opinion , there is nothing more important than health in a human ' s life and the happiness and welfare come with health . 	0
PE	11562	Totally , the most important reason for me to be self-employed is the sense of free . 	0
PE	11563	Moreover , earning money is the fundamental reason that why people work . 	0
PE	11564	Some people may argue that children will be more material , neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers . 	1
PE	11565	For example , if a child works as a shop assistant , he will have to keep an eye on good and products , calculate prices correctly and take responsibilities for any lost . 	0
PE	11566	I recommend that parents should help their children to choose a suitable job which does not affect their children ' s study and that the government should have right policies to avoid exploiting children ' s labour . 	0
PE	11567	Work for themselves vs work for employer 	0
PE	11568	Most people want to work for an employer , because they want to feel secure about their salary , or feel comfortable about other problems of having own job such as paying tax , worrying about selling , etc . Despite these problems , personally , I would prefer to have my own job . 	1
PE	11569	My arguments are listed as follows . 	0
PE	11570	First , time is the more valuable thing , which I have in my life . 	1
PE	11571	By having my own business , I can manage my own time . 	0
PE	11572	I could work whenever I want , or I do not need to give reasons to my boss for a delay . 	0
PE	11573	I can arrange time to travel when I would like . 	0
PE	11574	In addition , I can work long hours for earning more money . 	0
PE	11575	Moreover , classroom could provide exercise class to set students to have a good health . 	0
PE	11576	Thus , having classroom could provide abundant skills to students . 	1
PE	11577	A student is good or not do not depend on whether he has a good teacher but is decided by his effort on study . 	0
PE	11578	It is useless to hire a super famous teacher to teach those who behaviors as sluggards . 	0
PE	11579	Admittedly , on the other hand , there might be some people proclaiming that schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers because they can impart their students well . 	1
PE	11580	However , according to my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence . 	0
PE	11581	With this distinguished performance , the student would acquire an unforgettable and valuable experience burring deeply in his mind . 	0
PE	11582	Hence , from this case , we are capable of stating that students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities . 	1
PE	11583	Consider a circumstance in which a student who is a member of jazz ensemble in their school . 	0
PE	11584	He must need a better auditorium for him to have an extraordinary performance . 	0
PE	11585	Moreover , another equally crucial aspect is that students are not always staying in classrooms . 	0
PE	11586	They have numerous activities in school . 	0
PE	11587	For youngsters , maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not . 	0
PE	11588	For example , my younger sister likes fencing , and thanks to her desire to win , she never gives up when facing a difficult situation , or even becoming hurt . 	0
PE	11589	On the other hand , adults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately . 	0
PE	11590	In fact , a competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues . 	0
PE	11591	Because of that , they no longer play games for any moderate achievements , and gradually lose their interest in such activities . 	0
PE	11592	To sum up , I think adults do need to play games , but their styles are often distinct from children ' s , which are often less competitive and more enjoyable . 	1
PE	11593	Along with the high requirement for family and work , games are just some leisure activities for adults , not something necessary as they are meant to be for children . 	1
PE	11594	When in dilemma , the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand . 	0
PE	11595	In conclusion , more emphasis should be laid on human beings other than animals , and it is better to let nature take its course with regard to species extinction . 	1
PE	11596	Furthermore , human beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation , disease and wars . 	0
PE	11597	On most occasions , the process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it . 	0
PE	11598	We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species . 	1
PE	11599	When these problems are taken into account , extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help . 	0
PE	11600	In conclusion , young age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art and they are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage , but in every stage . 	1
PE	11601	Music and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his / her life . 	1
PE	11602	Furthermore , the city has well-organised lines of transport . 	0
PE	11603	Meeting and knowing new people ' s tradition is an unforgettable experience , which could influence on one ' s previous habits . 	0
PE	11604	Moreover , in the urban areas there are also more citizens what means , that the culture diversity is huge . 	1
PE	11605	Of course living in a city is more expensive , but incomes are higher too . 	0
PE	11606	There are not only more jobs , but they are also well-paid . 	0
PE	11607	In addition , I believe that city provides more work opportunities than the countryside . 	1
PE	11608	This means , that the schools and the universities have well equipped classes and the famous professors would like to work in such places . 	0
PE	11609	Firstly , in the city there is much better education system . 	1
PE	11610	As far as I am concerned , I agree with the statement that life in a city is much better than life in the countryside . 	1
PE	11611	Life in a city is much better than life in the countryside 	0
PE	11612	That is why many governments around the world invest more money on developing public transportation facilities . 	0
PE	11613	People opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs . 	0
PE	11614	It is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity . 	0
PE	11615	This can be seen no where clearer than in increasing use of machines now a days . 	0
PE	11616	Advancements in technology have touched new heights in past few decades . 	0
PE	11617	Stress may be a positive mobilization to drive for success . 	0
PE	11618	Besides , people are draining the Earth ' s natural resources . 	1
PE	11619	These resources such as oil , coal are vital for human activity , therefore nowadays , the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people . 	0
PE	11620	Stress , our body ' s way of responding to any kind of demand , can be caused by both good and bad experiences . 	0
PE	11621	Some people advocate the idea that human activity is advantageously influencing to the Earth . 	0
PE	11622	However , I strongly believe that human activities are having a bad effect upon our planet , for human are polluting the Earth ' s environment , exhausting natural resource and threatening the living of other species . 	1
PE	11623	Some people believe that the Earth is being harmed by human 	0
PE	11624	Whether human activity is making the Earth a better place to live or damaging it is a debatable issue . 	0
PE	11625	These wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a " new " continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage . 	0
PE	11626	Furthermore , the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air , causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain , global warming or climate change . 	0
PE	11627	People are corrupting their ecosphere . 	1
PE	11628	In recent decades , concurrently with the increase of human consume , the waste discarded by human also multiplies . 	0
PE	11629	However , it is widely thought that we experience stress any time , which comes across unexpectedly that frustrates our goals . 	0
PE	11630	Therefore , government should spend money on preservation of old buildings . 	1
PE	11631	Some people think that life is a struggle , which means we may encounter numerous difficulties during our lives . 	0
PE	11632	There is no chance to renovate to save a history site once it ' s gone . 	0
PE	11633	This reality brings us to light the importance of locating and saving old buildings of historic significance . 	0
PE	11634	What is a very important skill a person should learn 	0
PE	11635	Here are my reasons . 	0
PE	11636	Accordingly , stress management , how to survive our unbearable stress , is the most important skill that we should have . 	1
PE	11637	In conclusion , a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being . 	1
PE	11638	On the other hand , schools and university are places in which students gather to be educated and learn from each others as well as formal educators . 	0
PE	11639	It will be good for children , because indirectly they will learn how to socialize each other as a team . 	0
PE	11640	That will make children getting lots of friends , so they can contribute positively to community . 	0
PE	11641	Secondly , playing sport makes children getting healthy and become children ' s well-being . 	0
PE	11642	In conclusion , both studying hard at school and playing sports can improve children ' s future . 	1
PE	11643	At the same time , playing sports will give good effects on children . 	1
PE	11644	There are many popular sports among children such as football , basketball , and volleyball . 	0
PE	11645	Also , there are many benefit when children doing sport . 	0
PE	11646	Firstly , children who always playing sport like football , they will be active as a person and learn to become team-player . 	0
PE	11647	However , university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills . 	0
PE	11648	University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain . 	0
PE	11649	The learning process itself , however , is the most important and powerful way of evaluating a student . 	0
PE	11650	Nevertheless , professors could teach students through research and projects . 	1
PE	11651	It ' s an essential learning process . 	1
PE	11652	Passing the exams is not the terminal purpose of learning . 	0
PE	11653	It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people . 	0
PE	11654	It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed . 	0
PE	11655	Universtiy is an entrance to life . 	0
PE	11656	University education restriction 	0
PE	11657	Besides , it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done . 	0
PE	11658	To be precise , such abstract or complicated informatin , easily absorbed by those students , may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills . 	0
PE	11659	To begin with , outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage . 	1
PE	11660	Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached . 	0
PE	11661	Also , without sufficient guidance of teachers , these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes , posing a threat to other citizens ' security . 	0
PE	11662	As a result , such people might fail to get cured in time , thus influencing their working efficiency , which would destabilize the production of the industry . 	0
PE	11663	The long and the short of it , both arts and public services are important to the community and should be invested properly . 	1
PE	11664	Only those who sympathize with their fellowman can prosper in the long run . 	1
PE	11665	The underdeveloped nations , in return , may export local agricultural products , mineral products with discount to the former , boosting each other ' s economy . 	0
PE	11666	In summary , wealthy nations ' offering in need is not only a moral deed , but also a worthwhile one which will one day pay off in other ways . 	1
PE	11667	Alternatively I believe that it should taken into consideration the situation and conditions , that forces to a person to be a criminal . 	1
PE	11668	Some people think that it does not matter what is reason behind committing a crime therefore there should be fixed punishment for a specific crime . 	0
PE	11669	Generally reason behind punishment is to reduce the crime from a nation and to build a fear in the mind of offenders . 	0
PE	11670	Some people believe that there should be fixed punishment for each crime type 	0
PE	11671	On the contrary , fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government . 	1
PE	11672	The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place . 	0
PE	11673	Secondly , laws and rules are there for people therefore it is necessary to have a look behind crime for instance " a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women , who steals for her drug addiction " . 	1
PE	11674	First of all if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime because the punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime . 	1
PE	11675	Therefore fixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other . 	1
PE	11676	Everyone should be treated equally because sometimes we see that a poor person who do not have much money for hiring a good lawyer they get imprisoned even without committing a crime and when they come back to the society they become a professional criminal . 	0
PE	11677	Now that , it has useful and educational programs and quite helpful to relieve stresses for children . 	0
PE	11678	For these reasons , I strongly disagree with the statement that television has negative effects on children . 	1
PE	11679	Instead , this soccer match helped me to continue my academic career in the school , since it helped me to relieve my stress . 	0
PE	11680	In conclusion , of course , the television can have violent programs , however , if children can use Tv programs wisely , there are more positive effects than negative effects . 	1
PE	11681	Therefore , I would conclude that a single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication . 	1
PE	11682	On the other hand , every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage . 	1
PE	11683	I believe friends are people who have great compatibility with each other . 	0
PE	11684	First , it ' s not easy to make friend with anyone . 	0
PE	11685	Sometimes acquaintances are just acquaintances . 	0
PE	11686	After two years in college I have found sometimes there is more differences between people than similarities , for we are growing in the different families and was educated in various ways . 	0
PE	11687	There is no need for me to put any emphasis on the advantage of having a large number of casual acquaintance . 	0
PE	11688	One or two close friends vs . a large number of casual acquaintances 	0
PE	11689	We can not deny that being a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant . 	0
PE	11690	However , I still agree that it ' s better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances . 	1
PE	11691	So , it ' s much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends . 	1
PE	11692	We spend time together but we could never be friend . 	0
PE	11693	If the teachers receive higher salaries , they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth , as this is what is happening in Taiwan . 	0
PE	11694	Nevertheless , I believe that creating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances . 	1
PE	11695	Workers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss ' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile . 	0
PE	11696	For instance , junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students ' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work due to the fact that it is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want . 	0
PE	11697	In this essay , I would start by analyzing the factors for higher yields and finish by stating my position on this . 	0
PE	11698	A raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places . 	1
PE	11699	Paying more money is the only motivation to make employees work harder 	0
PE	11700	The purpose of this essay is to discuss whether or not the only way to motivate employees to be more hard-working and productive is by raising their salaries . 	0
PE	11701	Take Google for example , the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce . 	0
PE	11702	By doing this , the employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured . 	0
PE	11703	Unlike middle school or high school , university and college require far a lot of ability and skills to keep up with an enormous amount of complex knowledge . 	0
PE	11704	First , focusing only on talented students is a better option because it helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality . 	1
PE	11705	That explains why it is only suitable for a limited people , and opening up for everyone will be fatal for institutions , since they need to somehow lower the materials so that it is practical for everyone . 	0
PE	11706	In fact , some students may be capable in high schools , but the pressure of higher education is tough even for talented ones . 	0
PE	11707	Nevertheless , it has not changed the importance of teachers ' role in classes . 	0
PE	11708	University education should be only available for good students 	0
PE	11709	However , in my opinion , it should be better to leave this type of type of training for a certain group of good , knowledgeable learners . 	1
PE	11710	Some people think that all students should deserve to be educated at this level . 	0
PE	11711	Secondly , people can know more about the planet earth itself . 	1
PE	11712	For example , if one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual , full-length Buddhist sutra in Buddha ' s Birthday in India , he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture . 	0
PE	11713	To picture it , recently , Putin was pleased to open the last winter Olympic games and gather international countries , but actually it has been just facade and Putin didn ' t listen international warning after he conquered the Crimea . 	0
PE	11714	After the Olympics games are finished , everything came back to normal and all the game competition is forgotten by the majority . 	0
PE	11715	In other words , this is the " calm before the storm " . 	0
PE	11716	Thus , if the general atmosphere during the show is peaceful and fraternal , the reality is different . 	0
PE	11717	These meetings are in none case here to interact with international affairs . 	1
PE	11718	Finally , an international sports event is a very good thing to gather people , let them dream , being proud of their nationality and forget problems , but just for a while . 	1
PE	11719	When people move to another country , most likely , they will face the choice between following the customs of the new country or keeping their original one . 	0
PE	11720	Follow the New Customs of the New Country or Not ? 	0
PE	11721	The maintenance of traditional skills and ways of life ? 	0
PE	11722	There is no doubt the application of technological developments in some countries will be accompanied with modern skills and new lifestyles . 	0
PE	11723	It is argued that these so-called cultural invasions will result in the distinction of national traditions , and there is no need to maintain them . 	0
PE	11724	However , from my point of view , what can be expected , is a change of the role of the tradition but not its disappearance from the society . 	1
PE	11725	It is undeniable that the country ' s culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life . 	1
PE	11726	For instance , in Vietnam , many water puppet shows which once demonstrated our seasonal agriculture and communal activities , are today substituted by cinemas and music concerts . 	0
PE	11727	This means the young generation can solely get access to their ancestor ' s early life through books and images , which otherwise would be much more easily absorbed . 	0
PE	11728	In tradition , a person should look back at the past , mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle , to progress . 	1
PE	11729	Understanding why , and how our predecessors survived through thick and thin will probably be invaluable lessons for us today . 	0
PE	11730	Also , study form their mistakes helps us accomplish our goal with smooth sailing . 	0
PE	11731	Secondly , there are some drawbacks about this issue . 	0
PE	11732	Besides , nowadays technology is entering into our society really quick and scientists develop robots , which help people cope with their problems or just invent coffee machines , engines with integrated computers and etc . For example , before centeries , there were not washing machines , which clean your clothes , while a person do another job . 	1
PE	11733	These are two of the benefits , why IT is useful . 	0
PE	11734	In addition , World Wide Web offers humanity to access to information , which they want to know for less than 10 seconds . 	1
PE	11735	Firstly , connecting people by email is easy and fast . 	1
PE	11736	World Wide Web and communication via email are some of the positive sides of information technology , however , there are some negative aspects . 	0
PE	11737	Decade after decade , every day , scientists discover magnificent devices in the field of IT , such as interactive boards , multicore computers and laptops , tablets , which have an incredible resolution and also mobile phones , which have the power of a computer . 	0
PE	11738	There have been significant developments in the field of IT ! 	0
PE	11739	All this inventions will try to take control of the Earth . 	1
PE	11740	Scientists believe that one day people will face their developments , for instance robots , and they will not succeed to control them . 	0
PE	11741	For those reasons , it is natural to support the professors spending more time on doing research . 	1
PE	11742	While extending the way of their own development , the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society . 	1
PE	11743	Of course you need to choose a good neighborhood . 	0
PE	11744	I hold this belief because of two main reasons , academic and social reasons . 	1
PE	11745	We have to accept these changes for a world to be a better place . 	0
PE	11746	To conclude , I believe change is inevitable and that usage of one language across the world is a positive one . 	1
PE	11747	We did play video-games , but that wasn ' t our main activity . 	0
PE	11748	In a big city there are more kinds of people and more things to do . 	0
PE	11749	Some people thinks that if a child grows up in a big city they will be all day at home at the computer or at the video-game , but this is not true if you live in a neighborhood with other people about your age as I did . 	1
PE	11750	My friends and I used to play soccer , bike , climb trees and do a lot of other stuff every day . 	0
PE	11751	On the other hand , few people are worried about the dying local languages . 	1
PE	11752	Adding to that , exchange of knowledge in different sectors of research like electronics , medical , astronomy etc would become easier . 	0
PE	11753	Single language also reduces misunderstandings between people . 	0
PE	11754	Furthermore , students who migrate for better education would not have to go through lot of stress as they can easily make new friends and can be part of any discussions which is otherwise not possible in a world with multiple languages ; this in turn makes it easy to adjust in new environment . 	0
PE	11755	Further , these languages are tightly coupled with history ; all the olden day literature and scripts will be impossible to decipher if these languages are lost . 	0
PE	11756	As the usage of these languages decrease , culture also changes accordingly . 	0
PE	11757	They represent local culture . 	0
PE	11758	These languages are the basis for the origination and initial communication between different cultures . 	0
PE	11759	By participating in it , I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments . 	0
PE	11760	The research project provides a more efficient way of teaching . 	0
PE	11761	They can see lots of picture and videos of many interesting places . 	0
PE	11762	Moreover , people can learn other countries ' s culture and tradition which makes them have more knowledge about that nations . 	0
PE	11763	To conclude , people are satisfied with the internet and sometimes even thanks it because it helps us in studying , doing business and exploring the world . 	1
PE	11764	With valuable information it provides , people can enjoy their lives much more . 	1
PE	11765	Not only students but also everyone could get more information and knowledge . 	0
PE	11766	For instance , people who have problems with their health can search for more information about it . 	0
PE	11767	Last but not least , The internet makes the world becomes smaller which is a good thing . 	1
PE	11768	This is because people who have no time or have financial problems could travel around the world by using the internet . 	0
PE	11769	Thus , to cope with the physiological and psychological changes of adult life , to make financial life a less struggle and to prevent oneself digress from their destined path , it is important for young adults to live with their parents for a longer period of time . 	1
PE	11770	In a nutshell , I believe that young adults should only consider living on their own only after they are sure they could sustain on their own . 	1
PE	11771	It is unwise to trade the opportunity of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs . 	0
PE	11772	However , I believe that most young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have . 	0
PE	11773	It is good thing if living with parents does not give freedom for young people to party all night , smoke or do drugs . 	0
PE	11774	Young adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own , and thus missing the valuable input of their parents . 	0
PE	11775	While some critics may argue that , young adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want . 	1
PE	11776	This type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good . 	0
PE	11777	To conclude , I want to say that it is very important to be confident of the information , which you use , especially when your conclusion or decision may have a great influence . 	1
PE	11778	The gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the " salt-panic " was over . 	0
PE	11779	Sometimes it can be really difficult to find out the facts , especially in the internet , that ' s why you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts . 	1
PE	11780	Secondly , it is very important to know facts about some events or problem , not only estimations , because it can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate . 	0
PE	11781	For example , several years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week , because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops . 	0
PE	11782	It is possible to make a wrong decision because you have just used someone ' s personal opinion as a source of information , but it was actually wrong . 	0
PE	11783	Therefore , I decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well ! 	0
PE	11784	After that exam , I felt depressed and exhausted . 	0
PE	11785	As a case in point , last month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back . 	0
PE	11786	In my viewpoint , our body and moral health depend to physical activities directly . 	0
PE	11787	First , besides the good body shape , sports have very vital effects on human ' s healthfulness . 	0
PE	11788	In the following , I will state my reason for this choice . 	0
PE	11789	Although multitudes of people think that sports and social activities are not as necessary as academic subjects in colleges , I think that these activities have the same efficient role in students ' lives . 	1
PE	11790	It is very subjective decision for students to have or not have these facilities . 	0
PE	11791	There are a lot of debates about the importance of sports and social activities in contrast with the main classes . 	0
PE	11792	Financial support for sports and social activities 	0
PE	11793	In order to achieve this , they start cultivating their children when they are very young . 	0
PE	11794	Every parents expect their children to be outstanding and successful . 	0
PE	11795	An integration of music into learning process bound to be successful when it is not compulsory . 	1
PE	11796	On the other hand , music can help an individual to shape its character . 	1
PE	11797	Some people believe that paying tax is the only responsibility of citizens , while others disagree and think that being a person in society involves more responsibilities . 	0
PE	11798	Taxes are the income for every country in the world and they are extremely important for developing countries . 	0
PE	11799	The first reason why people are willing to visit museums when they travel to a new territory is that museums provide a tremendous amount of information about different aspects of the history and culture of that place , as I said back . 	1
PE	11800	I personaly tend to visit museums when I ' m in a new place because it ' s good for me know about the culture , tradition and history of other places . 	1
PE	11801	Many people like to visit museums when they travel to new places , other people don ' t like to visit museums . 	0
PE	11802	Reasons why travelers visit Museums ? 	0
PE	11803	However , other people visit museums are the most boring expirience of a trip . 	1
PE	11804	And that kind of knowledge speaks very highly of you . 	0
PE	11805	Visit museums can bring you the opportunity to establish relations and knowledge to participate in conversations . 	0
PE	11806	And also taking the chance for making friends . 	0
PE	11807	Admittedly , job can bring us happiness . 	1
PE	11808	In coclusion , the museums are a visual source to know the history , tradition and culture of any place in the world . 	1
PE	11809	My cousin Pedro literaly hates to visit museums but he really enjoyed his visit to the famous London - Madame Tussaud museum , it was kind of art entertainment but also that visit helped him to understand the artist works , and in addition he started to respect and admire other types of arts that offers in other museums . 	0
PE	11810	People can receive a sense of values and respected from job . 	0
PE	11811	If people receive respect from others , they will feel achievement and self-confidence . 	0
PE	11812	In addition , job can provide money to us . 	1
PE	11813	Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy . 	0
PE	11814	Firstly , a liberal policy is very feasible . 	0
PE	11815	However , to my mind students should be free not to attend classes because it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills . 	1
PE	11816	An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students . 	0
PE	11817	Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic . 	0
PE	11818	This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide . 	0
PE	11819	The issue at hand is whether it should be obligatory for university students to attend classes . 	0
PE	11820	Should students be required to attend classes ? 	0
PE	11821	So an optional attendance saves time and money . 	0
PE	11822	For example , Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl . 	0
PE	11823	Under suitable administration , tourism enhances local economic development 	0
PE	11824	Tourist trade is becoming a powerful engine for the economy . 	0
PE	11825	Nevertheless , some individuals believe that this position ignores the ecological and environmental destruction , as a result of tourist activities , and its adverse effects on local communities and ecosystems . 	0
PE	11826	While both positions seem reasonable , my view is that , through proper management and regulation , a booming tourist industry is an excellent source of economic growth and wealth for rural and urban areas . 	1
PE	11827	The most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region . 	1
PE	11828	This takes place , not only through direct expenditure from tourists , but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community , including retail , agriculture , and in the service industry . 	0
PE	11829	The increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation , luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid , well-regulated tourism programs . 	0
PE	11830	Furthermore , tourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community , including retail , hotels , transport , agriculture , and in the service industry . 	0
PE	11831	This increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes . 	0
PE	11832	As a result , this gives energy to the economic cycle , generating local economic prosperity in return . 	0
PE	11833	In addition , studying art and music is also the appropriate outlets of stress and superb ways to relax . 	1
PE	11834	Children managing their own money - best way to learn responsibility 	0
PE	11835	Not only do they contribute much to children ' s professional skills but also they can teach their students important social communication techniques in order to survive in this competitive world . 	1
PE	11836	In conclusion , technology has brought many benefits , but traditional skills and ways are always valuable and will last forever . 	1
PE	11837	If it was not for the space exploration , we would never know these facts . 	0
PE	11838	Some universities require students to study in one subject . 	0
PE	11839	On the contrary , others require students to study in several subjects . 	0
PE	11840	Why should human beings travel to outer space ? 	0
PE	11841	For many centuries , outer space has been one of the most favourable realms of study . 	0
PE	11842	Space expeditions have been launched and many have been successful . 	0
PE	11843	However , a lot of people still consider space exploration as an act of wasting money , to illustrate , astronauts only brought useless rocks back to planet earth despite the large sum of money spent on their equipment . 	0
PE	11844	On the other hand , there are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space . 	1
PE	11845	Universities require students to study many subjects or specialize in one subject 	0
PE	11846	For instance , a picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round , not flat . 	0
PE	11847	Another example is that it is the earth which goes around the sun , not vice versa . 	0
PE	11848	University is the place that provides people knowledge and skills to use in their real life . 	0
PE	11849	This is because they interested in many subjects and they want to try them all . 	0
PE	11850	For example , pupil who want to study science are also like to learn music . 	0
PE	11851	In my point of view , studying many subjects is better that one because students can study in subjects that they interested in , they can gain knowledge more than one field and they will have more chance to choose their future . 	1
PE	11852	First of all , when students finished their high schools , they are confused about subjects that they are going to choose to study in universities . 	0
PE	11853	However , I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment . 	1
PE	11854	In this view , the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting . 	1
PE	11855	As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources , advanced technologies and experience , they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards . 	0
PE	11856	Admittedly , some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection , thus ruining the local environments . 	0
PE	11857	As a result , unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen , which can put a strain on the natural resources . 	0
PE	11858	Besides , people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems . 	0
PE	11859	Currently , a great number of countries have pushed forward their economies by developing national industries . 	0
PE	11860	Economic development vs environment 	0
PE	11861	From my perspective , I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation . 	1
PE	11862	However , some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems . 	0
PE	11863	In addition , people who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one . 	1
PE	11864	Furthermore , this will encourage all the parents to think of the way to help their children to achieve more in their lives as they need to make some contribution too for their children future . 	1
PE	11865	In addition to that , the students will become more independent and it will build their characters in the marketplace as well . 	0
PE	11866	Primary and secondary education provide a basic knowledge and skills to the people in this world . 	0
PE	11867	Government and education 	0
PE	11868	Some parents might not have enough money to pay for their children university fees . 	1
PE	11869	I completely agree that government should provide those education to their people ; however , for the more higher education like university , the students or their parents should pay for the fees . 	1
PE	11870	It is better for them to use the money to pay for the other students ' education so that all people in their country could receive the same education . 	0
PE	11871	In the other hand , I don ' t think it is also fair for the government as the government has been paying a lot of money for their students ' primary and secondary education . 	1
PE	11872	They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves . 	1
PE	11873	Moreover , students that already have a basic knowledge and education can get a part-time job and they can pay for their own studies when their parent could not afford to pay it . 	0
PE	11874	For example , I worked in a large company , which has many different departments . 	0
PE	11875	First of all , when one knows different region ' s works , it will help one to get a friend much easier . 	1
PE	11876	The following will present my points . 	0
PE	11877	As far as I am concerned , having a large scale of different knowledge is the key to success . 	1
PE	11878	Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason . 	0
PE	11879	Some people believe that having a broad knowledge can give you a higher chance to success , while others think that professional in a specific subject is the key to enroll a success . 	0
PE	11880	Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject . 	0
PE	11881	Whether it is better to have broad knowledge or not 	0
PE	11882	What we do every day is to solve the problem that our clients asked in the phone . 	0
PE	11883	I was in the Management Information System department . 	0
PE	11884	At schools , students ' development has been orchestrated stage by stage , step by step by experienced teachers , and their acquisition of knowledge is guided and backed up in a systematic way . 	0
PE	11885	For instance , children who always studying hard and getting high achievement , it will be easy to pass qualification for work and they are more likely to find great work at multinational company . 	0
PE	11886	Therefore , formal education approaches are also indispensable . 	1
PE	11887	To put it all in a nutshell , I pen out saying that alternative sources information and traditional education systems are equally important in children ' s development . 	1
PE	11888	This strongly depicts the power of images in conveying messages , ideas , or opinions to people . 	0
PE	11889	Nevertheless , the importance of written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication that is commonly used . 	0
PE	11890	Is image more powerful than the written word ? 	0
PE	11891	" A picture is worth a thousand words " is a popular maxim that is being used for a very long time . 	0
PE	11892	For example , nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking . 	0
PE	11893	As a result , statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers , indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit . 	0
PE	11894	Hence , I agree only to certain degree that in today ' s world , image serves as a more effective means of communication . 	1
PE	11895	Firstly , pictures can influence the way people think . 	1
PE	11896	Not only that , the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter , which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan . 	0
PE	11897	Apart from that , images are also widely used in newspapers , magazines and advertisements . 	0
PE	11898	In conclusion , it is far better to protect our living environment rather than focus on job or work since the goal people is for good livers . 	1
PE	11899	In addition , cars increase the chance of employment because people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home . 	1
PE	11900	Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship . 	0
PE	11901	My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money . 	0
PE	11902	Furthermore , they are more flexible . 	0
PE	11903	If he had no car , he wouldn ' t be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms . 	0
PE	11904	He used his car to drive to the other end of the country , worked there during the week and came home for the weekend . 	0
PE	11905	If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life . 	0
PE	11906	Finally , the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world . 	0
PE	11907	There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car . 	0
PE	11908	They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas . 	0
PE	11909	When the students go to university , they have matured mentally and physically . 	1
PE	11910	In a nutshell , although few brilliant lecturers deliver more informative lectures , some are boring the students in the class and wasting the students ' time . 	1
PE	11911	Therefore , to make use of time , if the students choose the classes as optional , it would provide more benefits than drawbacks . 	1
PE	11912	They have enough knowledge to choose what they need to do . 	1
PE	11913	In conclusion , taking the part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it . 	1
PE	11914	Therefore , parents should encourage students to take the part-time job . 	1
PE	11915	It goes without saying that no pupil can succeed at school unassisted . 	0
PE	11916	Classmates ' impacts on children ' s performance at school 	0
PE	11917	It is argued that parents who are the closet to children mainly contribute to their accomplishments . 	0
PE	11918	Their success should be attributed to many different external factors . 	0
PE	11919	To begin with , the classmates themselves creat a competitive atmoshphere which incent the children . 	1
PE	11920	However , in my opinion , the classmates should be regarded as the most important influence on individual achievements . 	1
PE	11921	From a psychological perspective , the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exert enormous pressure on the children , which subsequently transforms into some sort of stimulants and boosts the children ' s academic performances . 	0
PE	11922	In high school , for instance , an individual cannot resist studying painstakingly through day and night when the others who are astoundingly ambitious and set sights on prestigious universities around the globe are doing the same . 	0
PE	11923	It is a matter of fact that students share even more time together than with their parents , explaining a great deal of wisdom they absorb from each others ; it can be , for example , lessons on the class , social skills or general etiquettes that are sometimes overlooked by parents . 	0
PE	11924	To add up , when it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such , classmates are second to none . 	1
PE	11925	They not only free to do whatever they want without any confine or punishment , but also they are free and have a lot of time in their hands to try and experience new things and enjoy them . 	1
PE	11926	All in all , I would maintain that the best phase of people life is their childhood . 	1
PE	11927	Have you ever traveled along to support your home football team during tournaments ? 	0
PE	11928	Live football game at a stadium 	0
PE	11929	If you have a great love with football and your home team , it is much more gratifying to stay side by side and cheer up the team at the stadium rather than just to stay at home and watch the match alone . 	1
PE	11930	Have you attended at a stadium to watch your team ' s match , yell or even cry with the team and their thousands of fans there ? 	0
PE	11931	Before the match starts , thousands of fans gathering outside of the stadium with team flags , colorful outfits , sound of trumpets and rattles . . . everywhere . 	0
PE	11932	First , attending a live football match is very fulfilling . 	1
PE	11933	You are watching football stars play the game with your own eyes and sharing your feelings with about 40 , 000 people at the stadium , such an excitement you can never have when you are watching it at home . 	0
PE	11934	As the game kicks off , the atmosphere inside the stadium is even more exciting . 	0
PE	11935	See , you will be bored if you are watching it alone . 	0
PE	11936	Everybody yells and sings together , the stadium is like bursted out whenever a goal is scored . 	0
PE	11937	Imagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws . 	1
PE	11938	Mind can not work when it is chained in boundaries . 	1
PE	11939	I firmly believe that artists should be given the freedom of expression . 	1
PE	11940	Being a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you . 	0
PE	11941	Another great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day . 	0
PE	11942	I agree with the statement that childhood is the happiest period of one ' s life . 	1
PE	11943	Childhood is the happiest time of a person ' s life 	0
PE	11944	Starting with our adulthood , we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives . 	0
PE	11945	It ' s not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives , but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think . 	1
PE	11946	Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community . 	0
PE	11947	So , relating well to people is also another important factor . 	1
PE	11948	Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren ' t supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult . 	0
PE	11949	But during our childhood , though responsibilies exist , we are much more free to do what we would like to . 	1
PE	11950	Many students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world . 	0
PE	11951	Mitigating process , no interaction and pressure are these things people should examine when they want to work at home . 	1
PE	11952	Researches into humanities and art still need large amount of money , what ' s more , government ' s big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide . 	1
PE	11953	From reasons listed above , we can safely draw the conclusion that , a government should spare effort on young children education as well as universities , both are crucial on the way to a brighter future . 	1
PE	11954	An illustration of this unfortunate trend can be seen almost everywhere these days , wherein most teens at an early age own phones which are worth twice the salary of their parents . 	0
PE	11955	Furthermore , most of these juveniles are students so they would need their parents to support them financially for what they want . 	0
PE	11956	Relatively , these do not come at a significant and inexpensive cost . 	0
PE	11957	They would not only purchase a phone because of its functionality but also for its brand . 	0
PE	11958	Therefore , I highly discourage the young ones to be overly dependent on mobile phones . 	0
PE	11959	This clearly shows that the negative impacts brought about by mobile phones are harmful to a person ’ s education and character . 	1
PE	11960	I believe parents can lead their children to a more smooth career path . 	1
PE	11961	In considering whether one should choose a job similar to his or her parents ' , I have mentioned a few reasons that one can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry . 	1
PE	11962	As we all know life saving oxygen is produced by trees after converting harmful carbon dioxide gas . 	0
PE	11963	Moreover , wild life is very essential to maintain ecological balance on planet Earth . 	0
PE	11964	Firstly , rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world . 	1
PE	11965	The so-called Concrete jungles have evolved endangering forests and wild life . 	0
PE	11966	There has been a lot of initiatives to protect the planet Earth from unbridled human developments . 	0
PE	11967	Although some people argue these developments are making our life comfortable , but concerns to save Earth are vital due to various reasons . 	1
PE	11968	For example , every other day , new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others . 	0
PE	11969	Competition helps in improvement and evolution . 	1
PE	11970	Competition has helped the development of science and technology . 	0
PE	11971	An individual must compete with oneself only , instead of trying to beat others . 	0
PE	11972	Unfortunately , the meaning of competiton has been modified in a wrong direction . 	0
PE	11973	However , competition is also as important as co-operation . 	0
PE	11974	A co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people ' s achievements . 	0
PE	11975	It helps to identify one ' s strengths and weaknesses as compared to others . 	0
PE	11976	Nevertheless , co-operation helps to understand other ' s perspective and learn by their mistakes . 	1
PE	11977	In the same way , co-operative approach will save time , energy and will have a higher success rate . 	0
PE	11978	Although technologies allowed us to have a convenient life , it has made our lives more chaotic according to the reasons mentioned above . 	1
PE	11979	Furthermore , jobs has various responsibilities like attendance , sometimes extra work and so on . 	0
PE	11980	This would result in stress , tension and tiredness . 	0
PE	11981	It divert their mind from studies and would take away their childhood phase from their life . 	1
PE	11982	A student has to do lots of studies in today ' s competitive world to prove himself . 	0
PE	11983	He has to spend his most of time in school to get a good grades . 	0
PE	11984	If the student get involved himself in job in rest of the time , then it would cause an extra burden on them . 	1
PE	11985	Do you think it is good for teenagers to work while schooling ? 	0
PE	11986	In my opinion , it is not the good idea for teenagers to have job while they are still students . 	1
PE	11987	Although , many argue that it provide good working experience , but I think it can interfere with their life in various ways . 	1
PE	11988	Having jobs would affect the health of the student . 	1
PE	11989	The repercussion are so severe that their families and friends remain deprived off their attention and in the end they end up losing balance between their family and personal life . 	0
PE	11990	Secondly , these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign . 	1
PE	11991	As they usually remain busy in their office so they do not find leisure time for such social activities . 	0
PE	11992	For instance , I would take my boss ' s example ; he has been working for extended hours in office for many years . 	0
PE	11993	Recently , his health and personal life was drastically affected as he broke up with his wife and his family life has totally been in chaos and cries . 	0
PE	11994	He started regretting afterwards and now trying to manage his work but it seems to be too late for him . 	0
PE	11995	To conclude this , I would strongly emphasis and recommend , Government must include the clause of maximum number of working hours in its Labor Law and enforce to all companies for ensuring their employees do not spend extended hours in companies . 	1
PE	11996	This will help in uplift of society , and bring the lost equilibrium between personal and professional life of each individual person . 	1
PE	11997	In a nutshell , the advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable . 	1
PE	11998	I am usually inclined to this idea and I hope that the government will regard the investment in building roads as the most important thing . 	0
PE	11999	To sum up , everything has its own gains and losses and advertisement is not an exception . 	0
PE	12000	From my point of view , advertising will be better if producers and advertisers are more honest in producing advertisements to give people the general view on one product . 	0
PE	12001	No wonder why this drinking title becomes more and more familiar with customers around the world . 	0
PE	12002	Last but not least , online advertisement is one of the easiest approaches due to their potential gains such as cheaper cost , convenience and easily observing . 	0
PE	12003	Establishing a new university in your community 	0
PE	12004	I will be happy to hear that the government has a plan to build a new university in my community . 	1
PE	12005	There are many advantages setting up the university such as more opportunities to people in the community to pursue their studies , creation of jobs . 	1
PE	12006	However , they come together with some disadvantages such as social problems . 	0
PE	12007	Undoubtedly , the university will have to hire professors , employees and etc . Thus , a number vacant positions need to be filled . 	0
PE	12008	Also there will be more opportunities to work in the community . 	0
PE	12009	Some people who hold different viewpoints may advocate that protecting traditions consume too much financial budget compared with the incoming it takes . 	1
PE	12010	In spite of the fact this kind of business bring limited contribution to government finance , it should be emphasized that the expense is trivial compared with the potential value of traditions . 	0
PE	12011	Therefore the government authorities and education institutes should work closely together to promote the traditional skills and ways of life , so as to make people to realize the value of them . 	1
PE	12012	All in all , protection of tradition is not only important for the entire society currently , but also contributes to the next generation . 	1
PE	12013	This helps readers to get updated and act accordingly . 	0
PE	12014	For example , when the aircraft MH 370 went missing , everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident . 	0
PE	12015	The importance of games for adults comparing to children 	0
PE	12016	As people grow up , the arguments about the importance of games arise . 	0
PE	12017	But , more often , the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies , and as a result , they cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago . 	0
PE	12018	For example , in my country , except for a minor part of professional athletes , the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job . 	0
PE	12019	The first reason is that games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin . 	1
PE	12020	Someone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life . 	0
PE	12021	Internet will end the era of newspapers and magazines 	0
PE	12022	Digital media has been extremely popular among people around the globe . 	0
PE	12023	With this advancement , newspapers and magazines are struggling to justify their existence . 	0
PE	12024	Some believe that traditional paper media will come to an end very soon due to the increased usage of internet based media . 	0
PE	12025	But many other still thinks they are going to stay . 	0
PE	12026	I agree to the argument that newspapers and magazines will be history with the time . 	1
PE	12027	I will establish my view by analysing how internet presents the information about the current affair so fast and the accessibility to the historical news . 	1
PE	12028	A very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis . 	0
PE	12029	The main disadvantage is contamination . 	1
PE	12030	For example , the estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers ' accommodation need . 	0
PE	12031	First of all , a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate . 	1
PE	12032	From my point of view , the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages , if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories . 	1
PE	12033	Finally , all professors in the university are fortune of the society . 	0
PE	12034	That is good for both of the professor and students . 	0
PE	12035	Without their research , there will be no new technologies come out quickly . 	1
PE	12036	They are the leaders almost in every fields of science , arts , culture and so on . 	0
PE	12037	If a professor doesn ' t get any researching works , he cannot give us the opportunity . 	1
PE	12038	There are three reasons that can explain their unresponsiveness to the modern workplace . 	0
PE	12039	But we can only turn to our professors when we want to take part in a research and to get ourselves promoted . 	0
PE	12040	He or she may stimulate us students to come up with some creative sugesstions . 	0
PE	12041	In addition , a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time . 	1
PE	12042	This is still true in the industrial society nowadays , where younger workers are preferably employed and promoted rather than over-50 workers . 	0
PE	12043	If you show in your workplace that you are the one who can work more than other even carelessly , your boss will assign you more tasks . 	0
PE	12044	If you do them fast too , the first acknowledgement of your boss encourages you to work harder . 	0
PE	12045	The more money , the more chances . 	0
PE	12046	Last but not least , people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks . 	1
PE	12047	This fact pushes them to work faster and faster . 	0
PE	12048	For example , because applying to study abroad needs a lot of money , I am working in two organization to gain more salary . 	0
PE	12049	Most importantly , people prone to work in two or three firms in a week because the expenses have been increased . 	1
PE	12050	If they work just in one organization they cannot earn enough money . 	0
PE	12051	He has been threatened by his boss who was going to fire him . 	0
PE	12052	My friend went to a course where he learned how should work rapidly and now he is working . 	0
PE	12053	Co-education helps both genders to gel well with each other . 	0
PE	12054	It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together . 	0
PE	12055	Should universities accept equal number of males / females or not 	0
PE	12056	Education is important for the development of the world . 	0
PE	12057	Its a debatable issue whether universities should accept equal number of males and females in a course or not . 	0
PE	12058	However , since both genders are equally important , both must be given equal opportunities . 	0
PE	12059	Universities must admit both in equal numbers , depending on their choices . 	1
PE	12060	Right to education is a basic human right of both , males and females . 	0
PE	12061	The whole world aims for women empowerment , and to achieve this , females should be given equal opportunities as males . 	1
PE	12062	When universities will accept them in equal number , both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop . 	0
PE	12063	I think the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively . 	0
PE	12064	By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment . 	0
PE	12065	A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer . 	0
PE	12066	Thus , students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning . 	0
PE	12067	That is to say , students have a better environment to working on their assignments so the quality of their assignments will improve . 	0
PE	12068	For example , most would rather choose to piece together parts of a machine than have it done by a robot for their disbelief of its efficiency and safety compared with human ' s capability . 	0
PE	12069	In my school , the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby . 	0
PE	12070	For me , I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment . 	0
PE	12071	It ' s unpleasant to stay at school . 	0
PE	12072	However , coffee shops are not always quiet , so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly . 	0
PE	12073	Hence , even though freedom to express ideas can bring some negative effects , I certainly believe that there are many wonderful and beautiful Arts due to the freedom to express ideas and thus , I strongly believe there should be no restrictions on them . 	1
PE	12074	I connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget , even though now I ' m not studying chemistry anymore . 	0
PE	12075	Second , by bridging the theories with daily life events , students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem-solving . 	1
PE	12076	However , on the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition , saying that universities provide not only skills for careers , but also academic knowledge for the human race , such as bio science , politics , and medicine . 	1
PE	12077	These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world . 	0
PE	12078	To begin with , those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons . 	0
PE	12079	From their point of view , the fact is that there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation , such as mechanics , sales persons , or engineers , and , furthermore , labors for graduates are in short supply . 	0
PE	12080	What is worse , the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying . 	0
PE	12081	In this regard it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs , even can be a sheer time-consuming . 	1
PE	12082	Young people should go to university or not 	0
PE	12083	Persistent deliberation is happening as to whether it is desirable for the youth to go to university . 	0
PE	12084	In regard to the development of the country , some people believe that it is essential for young students to get high quality of education in universities , while others think that it is only one of causes to increase the rate of unemployment . 	0
PE	12085	In this essay , I will analyze both views first in order to come up with a fool-proof decision . 	0
PE	12086	That ' s why education in university is discussed all the time . 	0
PE	12087	What is the best way to orientate the students ? 	0
PE	12088	I ' m against providing more money to professors 	0
PE	12089	The misery is so ingrained in their mind that they refuse to change , or more precisely , to accept the existence of such modernity . 	0
PE	12090	The professors are essential , however , the schools are established for students . 	1
PE	12091	Money should spend on facilities in school or update resources , which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors . 	1
PE	12092	Raising the salaries of professors so ? 	0
PE	12093	I would say no . 	0
PE	12094	The following are my opinions . 	0
PE	12095	To begin with , the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors . 	1
PE	12096	The old were raised in poverty , probably caused by war , look at the world from a negative and pessimistic point of view . 	0
PE	12097	First and foremost , old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm . 	1
PE	12098	This may help those who are in the process of panning a criminal act perfect their plans , avoid the pitfalls and make themselves harder to be tracked down by the police . 	0
PE	12099	An even more detrimental fact is that detailed reports of crimes exposured on the press may provide the potential criminals with instructive learning materials , which would be hard to obtain otherwise . 	0
PE	12100	Hence , staying longer with parents is a better choice . 	1
PE	12101	Furthermore , temporarily targets should be set , with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time , for example , a season . 	0
PE	12102	Primarily , authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities , such as constructing more bus lines , in order to reducing the usage of private cars . 	0
PE	12103	Meanwhile , cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out , though it might not be into effect immediately , but in the long run , it would be a wise choice . 	0
PE	12104	Plus with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems . 	0
PE	12105	In conclusion , addressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price is not adequate , while improving transportation facilities and building supervisory institution would be preferable , plus with the awareness of environmental protection being raised . 	1
PE	12106	In conclusion , I admit that modern technology has provided a more convenient and comfortable manner for people to watch exhibitions , but museums and art galleries are necessary to be preserved for its importance of education and culture . 	1
PE	12107	Underdeveloped nations no doubt receive direct benefits through such deeds . 	0
PE	12108	Thus , without the prevention on criminal details , the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken . 	1
PE	12109	For instance , there many game applications available online and many of them are quite aggressive in nature . 	0
PE	12110	Furthermore , the growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development . 	1
PE	12111	For example , as people , especially teenagers increasingly tend to focus on their phones , they may lose their interests on daily activities such as meeting with friends , and this lack of communication may impair their future negotiation and interpersonal skills . 	0
PE	12112	In the first place , spending too much time on mobiles phones many exert an adverse effect on our social skills . 	0
PE	12113	As a result , it is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently . 	1
PE	12114	Moreover , continuous use of mobile phones may also damage children ' s eyesight and physical posture . 	0
PE	12115	Recently , there has been a social concern with regard to whether or not mobiles phones have negative effects on our social life . 	0
PE	12116	Mobile phones : faster communication vs social problems 	0
PE	12117	However , I believe , this great invention in the 21st century causes many problems in our society . 	1
PE	12118	Indeed , mobile phones have widely been used by people of all ages . 	0
PE	12119	Having one ' s own hobbies and doing physical activities can bring us a lot of benefits . 	1
PE	12120	First , having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit . 	1
PE	12121	Looking at the computer screen all day long can make us daze , so doing some sport and hobbies can prevent us from becoming too fat or short-sighted . 	0
PE	12122	My neighbor Tom once was a computer engineer in a big company . 	0
PE	12123	People should have hobbies and do physical activities 	0
PE	12124	Whether or not people should have hobbies and do physical activities has been a controversial question . 	0
PE	12125	Different people have different ideas . 	0
PE	12126	Some people think we should focus on our jobs , but I don ' t agree with them . 	0
PE	12127	He ate fast food everyday and never went out to exercise . 	0
PE	12128	When he found out that he was too fat to find a girlfriend , he made up his mind to loose weight . 	0
PE	12129	Thirdly , the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide . 	1
PE	12130	What is worse , some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police , which makes citizens always live in danger . 	0
PE	12131	Take an example , in American , young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns , which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting . 	0
PE	12132	Eventually , guns will create a violent society if the trend continues . 	0
PE	12133	To conclude , both options have their advantages , but personally I think the advantages of living in an apartment outshine those of living in a dormitory . 	1
PE	12134	Unfortunately , there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over . 	0
PE	12135	In the US , firearms remain the most common method of suicide , accounting for about 50 per cent . 	0
PE	12136	Hence I support this point that the learning with a teacher is better . 	1
PE	12137	Notable one of the shortcomings is that if someone faced so complicated confusion in his study and his many endeavors on making out it were miscarried , this might be ended in disappointment . 	0
PE	12138	I think that for one who depends on only himself in learning , his improvement of ability , with regard to cooperation and express his opinion , is unpromising . 	0
PE	12139	knowledge may be thereby better improved and strengthened . 	0
PE	12140	Finally , of course , being without a teacher has shortcomings . 	1
PE	12141	Furthermore , the teachers play important role in leading us to right direction . 	0
PE	12142	Moreover , This gives us opportunity to rise our educational level to an exited degree . 	0
PE	12143	Secondly , in my mind , the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself . 	1
PE	12144	We can accomplish our assignments with little help of a teacher within less time than do it by ourself . 	0
PE	12145	Admittedly , there are a few students paying considerable time on the computer games playing finally choose computer games related jobs as their career . 	1
PE	12146	However , those subjects are not suitable for the students and will bring bad effects to the youths . 	0
PE	12147	Since all these games are developed for commercial purpose and in order to catch the eyes of the children , majority of the games use war , violence , bloody , or sexual subjects to lure the students . 	0
PE	12148	Second , children could learn nothing from these computer games , therefore time on this activity is really time wasting . 	1
PE	12149	Recent research by Scientist also reveals that the youngs are more likely to be attacted by and lose themselves in these computer games , because of their low control ability . 	0
PE	12150	An investigation done by Beijing University shows that 80% of the students who failed in the final exam paid 2 hours or more on-online games every week , while 90% excellent students expressed that they did not touch computer games during the most of the days . 	0
PE	12151	First and foremost , a large number of students are obsessed in on-line computer games and as a result their performance in school are declined . 	1
PE	12152	I hold a positive view against this opinion . 	0
PE	12153	It is a debatable subject that children should not be allowed to play computer games since playing computer games is a a waste of time . 	1
PE	12154	Disagree Playing Computer Games wastes time and students should not be allowed ! 	0
PE	12155	Last , we should develop at least one personal hobby , not to show off , but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured . 	1
PE	12156	Playing musical instrument is a good way , I can play classical guitar . 	0
PE	12157	Humans are not robots ; we can ' t keep working for twenty-four hours . 	0
PE	12158	Doing sports or hobbies for a short time can recharge our batteries . 	0
PE	12159	Also , doing something for a long time can be boring , having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind . 	1
PE	12160	For example , at school , students have breaks every class so that they can relax for a few minutes and prepare for the next class . 	0
PE	12161	He started to jog every morning . 	0
PE	12162	After a moth , he is thinner and finds a girlfriend . 	0
PE	12163	When I meet difficulties in studies , I will take my guitar and play the song Green Sleeves . 	0
PE	12164	It makes me feel better and gives me the confidence . 	0
PE	12165	In conclusion , I completely agree that government should not pay for the university fees because this will make both the parents and students in charge for their future themselves not just depend on the government to do all their responsibilities for them . 	1
PE	12166	Secondly , the centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve . 	1
PE	12167	Especially , if they have no knowledge or education in this field . 	0
PE	12168	If a university plans to develop a new research in my country and I have to choose between establishing a centre for business research or a centre for agriculture research , I would opt for the second one . 	1
PE	12169	These researches can be aimed for several fields such as business or agriculture . 	0
PE	12170	Most of the universities in the world seek to develop some research in some countries . 	0
PE	12171	A university plans to devlope a new research centre in your country 	0
PE	12172	This centre can also help people there to solve their issues related to their land . 	1
PE	12173	The centre for research in agriculture can help my co-citizens to better exploit these land . 	1
PE	12174	Most of these lands are left without any treatment . 	0
PE	12175	First of all , my country has a lot of land which is useful for the agriculture . 	0
PE	12176	After a while the situation became clear , but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia . 	0
PE	12177	For example , Russian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia , however , european news announced that it was initiated by Russia . 	0
PE	12178	Nowadays information plays an important role in our world . 	0
PE	12179	Gossip-based information 	0
PE	12180	Some people say : " information is power " . 	1
PE	12181	It has become a product , which can be sold , bought , or stolen . 	0
PE	12182	I consider the statement above to be right for several reasons . 	0
PE	12183	That ' s why it is so important to be well-informed . 	0
PE	12184	Some people may disinform you on purpose , that ' s why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information . 	0
PE	12185	The first reason is that by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability . 	1
PE	12186	For example , in a survey carried out in a university , it was asked to students that why did they start smoking , then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes . 	0
PE	12187	Many young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age . 	0
PE	12188	First of all , it is seen that following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents . 	1
PE	12189	This will be proven by looking at how health and personality of young people is affected by following celebrities as their mentors . 	0
PE	12190	It is agreed that following celebrities can be dangerous for the youth . 	1
PE	12191	These celebrities are popular among younger generations because of their glamorous lifestyles . 	0
PE	12192	Young people all over the world are greatly influenced by media and celebrities . 	0
PE	12193	Effect of celebrities on youth 	0
PE	12194	In conclusion , given the reasons described above , when the advantages and disadvantages of whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years or not are carefully compared , the best choice is obviously stand on my side , which is that the car use will definitely decrease in twenty years . 	1
PE	12195	Secondly , it is believed that when youth follows celebrities it affects personality of young people in a bad way . 	0
PE	12196	This example makes it clear that imitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals . 	0
PE	12197	Everyone that has strongly ambition could pursue and success their goal even they are not classified as a good student because people can change . 	0
PE	12198	With a good environment in college or university is encouraging students to study harder for a good future . 	0
PE	12199	On the other hand , there are some people think that all students should have equal opportunity to study in higher education . 	0
PE	12200	Of course , higher education take a lot of money and a lot of time however moderate students should have a chance to try . 	0
PE	12201	Students can have opportunity to learn , to practice , to gain more knowledge for their career and for their future . 	1
PE	12202	Studying in college and university is a great opportunity that all students should have . 	1
PE	12203	Thus , mediocre students should have opportunity to be trained in college and university . 	1
PE	12204	In conclusion , I personally agree with that college and university should be available for all students who want to pursue their goal . 	1
PE	12205	For instance , in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products because they have employees whose performance are very high . 	0
PE	12206	Consequently , When school gather teachers that have great performance , school are gaining higher quality . 	0
PE	12207	Teachers could augment their quality . 	0
PE	12208	Additionally , this evaluation from students could improve schools ' quality . 	1
PE	12209	Because teachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects , students could comprehend their subject easily . 	0
PE	12210	Students could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance . 	0
PE	12211	Finally , people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students . 	1
PE	12212	Schools could produce intellectual students because school have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students . 	0
PE	12213	In conclusion , I agree with this statement that school should ask students to evaluate their teachers because teachers could improve their performance . 	1
PE	12214	As a result , students , who study from great schools which have great performance teacher , graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life . 	0
PE	12215	So students should learn both from their teachers as well as modern technology to gain the best learning outcome . 	0
PE	12216	Since it is a classroom or campus projects , there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas . 	0
PE	12217	While we should realize that in a project , there are numerous coordination works are required , if each opinion is communicated via email , there will be hundreds or thousands of emails there that we know this is not a good experience . 	1
PE	12218	In conclusion , I prefer the project members to work in person rather them by email because work in person will be more efficient . 	1
PE	12219	While if the same words are expressed in talking , the counterparty will feel more relaxed since their response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim . 	0
PE	12220	Therefore , less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights , and enhance the communication amongst the team members . 	1
PE	12221	Admittedly , sometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place . 	0
PE	12222	Although emails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none . 	1
PE	12223	However , there are also disadvantages . 	0
PE	12224	A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental . 	1
PE	12225	When students work during these breaks , the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia . 	0
PE	12226	For instance , my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted . 	0
PE	12227	Working or traveling for some time , after high school , can help them to find their field of interest . 	1
PE	12228	It will also help them to learn professional setup by working . 	0
PE	12229	Financially , students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job . 	0
PE	12230	Some students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course . 	0
PE	12231	When he started his university studies , he failed miserably . 	0
PE	12232	Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time . 	0
PE	12233	First and foremost , sports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another so that they can improve their results , break records and bring victories to their own countries . 	1
PE	12234	Because a large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events , there are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures . 	0
PE	12235	Consequently , sport events with the spirit of healthiness , honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding , friendship and solidarity among nations . 	1
PE	12236	After sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition , the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners , which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations . 	0
PE	12237	Secondly , sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators . 	0
PE	12238	When individuals keep the habit of grasping the world ' s cutting-edge fashion information , they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world , which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world . 	0
PE	12239	This is because following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world ' s latest transformations , which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today . 	1
PE	12240	As a result , they might fall behind shortly . 	0
PE	12241	In contrast , if they stuck to their own fashion styles , disregarding the world ' s top fashion designers ' achievements , they would stay conservative in their own worlds . 	0
PE	12242	With increasing availability to the Internet , people can collect a wealth of information about the latest fashion trends over the world , such as the most popular shoes style this season or the best-liked clothes color this year . 	0
PE	12243	should one follow fashion trends rather than a personal style ? 	0
PE	12244	From my perspective , fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people ' s lives than personal dressing styles . 	1
PE	12245	However , some people think that dressing in a personal style should be advocated rather than following fashion trends . 	0
PE	12246	Without following fashion trends , such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes , let alone forming their own dressing styles . 	1
PE	12247	Furthermore , people with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information . 	0
PE	12248	On the other hand , living off campus prepares students for the real life . 	1
PE	12249	For example , students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible , independent , punctual , co-operative compared to living in university dormitories . 	0
PE	12250	In conclusion , given the reasons described above , when the advantages and disadvantages of whether having the knowledge in different fields is better or not are carefully compared . 	0
PE	12251	The best choice is obviously stand on my side , which is that a broad knowledge of different subjects is really important . 	1
PE	12252	However , what if one finally find out him or her has the talent in other filed . 	0
PE	12253	In this way , it won ’ t be a problem at all . 	0
PE	12254	People who hold different opinion may argue that if one can ’ t success one ’ s own major , what else things he can do in different filed . 	1
PE	12255	Of course , it may be true when talking about this topic . 	0
PE	12256	In addition , it is easier for students to get help when facing problem such as if students have problem in solving their math question , they can easily ask for help to their roommates , classmates , or teachers . 	0
PE	12257	I think living in dormitory is always helpful to students . 	1
PE	12258	That ' s the main reason I against providing more money to professors . 	1
PE	12259	Students are those who suppose to enjoy the use of their tuition . 	0
PE	12260	At school , students are priority . 	0
PE	12261	Students ' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university . 	1
PE	12262	And when they are in primary school , teachers teach them more further knowledge , like writing skills and using computers . 	0
PE	12263	They argue that teachers teach students how to write , read and calculate since they are in kindergarten . 	0
PE	12264	Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers . 	1
PE	12265	Now , many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful . 	0
PE	12266	They all enrich our daily lives . 	0
PE	12267	There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives , such as the Internet , television and cell phone . 	0
PE	12268	Over the last half century the change in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations . 	0
PE	12269	Lessons with teachers versus others sources 	0
PE	12270	On the other hand , students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers . 	0
PE	12271	It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling . 	0
PE	12272	In conclusion , a professor should do their research all the time during their careers as a teacher in university . 	1
PE	12273	And it ' s worth to spend more time on it than on teaching . 	0
PE	12274	However , some people point that technology has made children less creative . 	0
PE	12275	I don ' t deny that technology may have some negative effects on children , but I think technology makes children even more creative . 	1
PE	12276	First , technology inspires children to create new things . 	0
PE	12277	Children are curious about everything around them , so when they come across a high-tech product like a cellphone , they will be obsessed with its mysterious functions and eager to know how it works . 	0
PE	12278	Technology inspires children ' s creativity instead of weakening it 	0
PE	12279	Technology accelerates human ' s evolving pace . 	0
PE	12280	With advanced technology , many things that seemed impossible in the past , have become realities . 	0
PE	12281	For example , people in the past never dreamed of talking to anyone whenever they wanted or see someone overseas on a computer screen , both of these can be achieved with cellphone and internet . 	0
PE	12282	For example , Bill Gates was attracted by the original huge computer , then he did everything he could to understand how it worked . 	0
PE	12283	After he had figured out all the stuff , he then began to promote the computer . 	0
PE	12284	By doing this , outdoors relationships may expand and it may accompany with sexual relationship and as result , their thoughts deviate from the studies . 	0
PE	12285	By contrast , some experts believe that attending both girls and boys in a same school cause many disadvantages for them . 	0
PE	12286	Women or men almost need each other in full of life even in school . 	0
PE	12287	Attending boys and girls in a same school would bring many advantages 	0
PE	12288	In my opinion , boys and girls should study together in the sense that they have a chance to know each other and learn how to behave with an opposite sex . 	1
PE	12289	Although some experts believe that common schools for both female and male lead to diminish their efficiency in education , others view it as a helpful way to recognize the opposite gender . 	0
PE	12290	By attending to the same school , students can learn how to view the opposite gender in classes as a friend or a classmate . 	1
PE	12291	School is a small society for students , which prepares them for the future life . 	0
PE	12292	They would know how to ask her in order to cooperate with his study , how communicate with girls in a group , etc . Admittedly , when they study together and help each other , they exercise the the real life as they age . 	0
PE	12293	In addition , a boy would know how to speak with a girl in every situation and vice versa . 	0
PE	12294	Study achievements depend on a range of various factors , one of which is pattern of work you tend to choose while studying . 	0
PE	12295	Type of temper and advantages of individual work as best arguments in favor of studying alone 	0
PE	12296	As for me , I favor the latter because of the following reasons . 	0
PE	12297	In particular , we may prefer to work either within a team of other students or alone . 	0
PE	12298	Being by nature introvert , I have to spend much time and efforts on adjusting to surroundings and especially new people . 	0
PE	12299	To begin with , type of temper is one of the reasons that make me to choose individual work instead of team one . 	0
PE	12300	Therefore , my productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper . 	1
PE	12301	Once , when I was working on presentation with strangers , I sat aside and so prepared more than half of work myself instead of making attempts to get acquainted with unknown people . 	0
PE	12302	In other words , I must not divide tasks and duties between team members , share responsibility and benefits , and spend time on teambuilding . 	0
PE	12303	Furthermore / moreover , working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork . 	1
PE	12304	Not to mention , that hasty decisions , not only goes to waste , but also , could affect the entire life of the person . 	1
PE	12305	To put it differently , is that after this person has quit his job and became unemployed , he can no longer pay his bills nor buy what he needs for his everyday needs , thus , his life had taken a turn to the worst . 	0
PE	12306	For example : if someone decided to quit his job without really thinking about the alternative , or a plan B , he could end up being unemployed , because of his speedy decision . 	0
PE	12307	In addition , making a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity . 	1
PE	12308	In another word , if this person had waited and thought his decision through he wouldn ' t have missed out on the job opening in the same firm , but at a different position . 	0
PE	12309	Hence , he wouldn ' t have been unemployed . 	0
PE	12310	Haste makes waste 	0
PE	12311	This saying is stating that every fast and not well thought decision is a wasted one . 	1
PE	12312	In my opinion , this statement is completely true , for these few reasons : For one thing , making a quick decision means that it ' s not very thought out , and that it hasn ' t been checked from all its aspects . 	0
PE	12313	Consequently , making quick decisions leads to probable bad results . 	1
PE	12314	In my opinion , one of the main reasons for supporting this statement is that successful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things . 	1
PE	12315	According to a statistic conducted by the International Animal Preserving Association , we have only ten percent of the animals that have ever existed , which means that the biodiversity of our home is grievously endangered . 	0
PE	12316	First , conservation is more urgent now than at any time in history . 	1
PE	12317	If I had the opportunity to help a company make a decision on spending money either on supporting the arts or helping the environment , I would choose the latter without hesitation for the reasons below . 	0
PE	12318	Spending money on supporting art or protecting environment 	0
PE	12319	Furthermore , supporting environment protection will benefit the company eventually . 	1
PE	12320	In short , the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever and if we didn ' t take harsh measures now , we never will . 	0
PE	12321	If we continue discharging carbon dioxide with non-environmentally friendly cars , nations like Japan will be submerged and weather patterns could change , causing flooding , drought , and an increasing amount of damaging storms . 	0
PE	12322	What ' s more , rising sea levels , caused by global warming , have reached a level that is threatening human ' s life in many countries . 	0
PE	12323	Just imagine if the project your company is sponsoring effectively improves the environment , then your company would be known as an environmentally-friendly company and benefit from it in this consumer-oriented society . 	0
PE	12324	Nowadays , an increasing amount of people pay more attention to conservation ; therefore , sponsoring conservation is a more efficient method of advertising . 	0
PE	12325	However , it would be indispensable that the government conduct a survey about the community opinion on the new university first . 	0
PE	12326	I believe the benefit from it will outweigh the cost . 	1
PE	12327	These people depend solely on hard work and luck . 	0
PE	12328	Take for instance those who start their own business . 	0
PE	12329	To cite an example , Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19 . 	0
PE	12330	Interestingly , for some of them it proved to be a profitable job . 	0
PE	12331	Eventually , he used his earnings as well as his family ' s loan in order to progress to be who he is now . 	0
PE	12332	Initially , he started his computer company in his college dorm room . 	0
PE	12333	This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports . 	0
PE	12334	In addition , people with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life . 	0
PE	12335	To illustrate this further , David Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many . 	0
PE	12336	The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph . 	0
PE	12337	Also I got familiar with different kind of animals and plants in this age . 	0
PE	12338	As a matter of fact , I made a large number of friends in this age , and I almost traveled to all cities of my county when I was in kindergarten . 	0
PE	12339	If we lived in good environment , our life would be better . 	0
PE	12340	In addition to controlling emission carbon dioxide , government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy . 	1
PE	12341	Second , environment is also important issue that everyone depend on it . 	0
PE	12342	Thus , people have a good quality life . 	0
PE	12343	Therefore , criminal rate were drop . 	0
PE	12344	When people have jobs , they did not have to steal money . 	0
PE	12345	So , government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide . 	0
PE	12346	These impact on every living creature in the world . 	0
PE	12347	Greenhouse effect causes of climate change . 	0
PE	12348	Nowaday , industrial in many countries still emit high intense of carbon dioxide , which caused of greenhouse effect . 	0
PE	12349	For instance , through taking part in a sport , students can understand team spirit and learn lessons about teamwork skills . 	0
PE	12350	Therefore , these subjects might fulfil the students ' ability . 	1
PE	12351	Finally , children ' s future do not depend heavily on the academic subjects they study in school , it is the result of their efforts and capacity . 	0
PE	12352	In conclusion , although the academic subjects play a primary role in nurturing children , it seem to me that the effects of learning music , sports are profound . 	1
PE	12353	So it is important that government needs to impose rules on particularly advertisement company ( for example , toys company ) to avoid youngster have bias thought on what they really need . 	1
PE	12354	In my opinion , I think buying habit is people ' s choice to make , not entirely affected by advertisements . 	1
PE	12355	But for children or adolescents who is not mentally develop , it might be hard for them not to swayed by advertising . 	0
PE	12356	Blatantly seen , success of most companies stems from young people , whose enterprising ideas that catch up with the world is regarded as wind of refreshment . 	0
PE	12357	This , by all means , is outweigh by youngsters ' adventurousness and bravery . 	0
PE	12358	Hence , with the use of computers we spend less time in search for information , and can get it from different sources . 	0
PE	12359	Second , in a globalized world that we live computers made communications faster , visual and cheaper . 	0
PE	12360	Computers have made life easier 	0
PE	12361	The advent of the computer is one of the results of the development of the advantaged technology . 	0
PE	12362	While some people advocate for the idea that computers have made life more complex and stressful , others support the idea that computers have made life easier and more convenient . 	0
PE	12363	In my point of view , computers brought convenience and easiness to our life since they enabled easier access to information and increased qualities of the communication . 	1
PE	12364	First , computers through internet made our access to information easier . 	1
PE	12365	Through computers we can collect appropriate data very quickly , store it in the hard disc as long as we want and use it when needed . 	0
PE	12366	Search engines such as google , yandex with many features relevant to the characteristics of the information needed enable search of information in few minutes . 	0
PE	12367	Social networks such as facebook , twitter have changed traditional sources of information and decreasing the monopolization of the information by the governments . 	0
PE	12368	I think it ' s fun and educational . 	1
PE	12369	But in the future , it seems that the distance learning become more popular and ordinary in schools . 	0
PE	12370	In conclusion , traditional learning still has many benefits to the students . 	1
PE	12371	Nevertheless , I think it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology , and technology is not the root cause of the gap . 	0
PE	12372	To some extent , the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology , because only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products , and these products can help them to earn more in return . 	1
PE	12373	Under proper use of technology , the human being can be benefit a lot and perpetually from the advancement of it . 	1
PE	12374	In conclusion , the good technology bringing to us is undeniable . 	1
PE	12375	Nowadays , we can talk with our friends online , no matter where we are and how far between us . 	0
PE	12376	In the past time , we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us . 	0
PE	12377	Undoubtedly , everything has two sides and technology is not an exception . 	0
PE	12378	In addition , the Internet gives everyone access to the same information , this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals . 	0
PE	12379	That ' s why we can obtain reward from out excellent knowledge . 	0
PE	12380	To sum up , I would have to say that although we can use the ability of adapting oneself in a new environment , the excellent knowledge will be of more importance . 	1
PE	12381	After we get a job , the destination of we keep accumulating and collecting knowledge is rooted not in fawn on our manager with the ability to adapt this kind of business culture , but in making us excellent and totally master this job . 	0
PE	12382	Finally , we will be rewarded with pride . 	0
PE	12383	Employees will obtain reward from hard-work pursuing excellent knowledge . 	1
PE	12384	Through our whole study life , undergraduate and graduate , we keep learning with the purpose of exerting these knowledge and experience on our job , just like an old Chinese scholar said , the essence of study is utilizing it . 	0
PE	12385	The high reputation and popularity of a company is earned by some brilliant workers in public relation department with excellent skill to propagate this company . 	0
PE	12386	So the company will earn more money and reputation from these workers with excellent knowledge . 	0
PE	12387	Because it can not only benefit our employers , but also ourselves will be rewarded . 	1
PE	12388	Secondly , these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country . 	0
PE	12389	Thus , world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace . 	1
PE	12390	This clearly shows that international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back , sooner or later , to a relative peaceful normality . 	0
PE	12391	For example , when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War , its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers . 	0
PE	12392	Firstly , during times of war , people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event . 	0
PE	12393	This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace , and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols . 	0
PE	12394	It is agreed that large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes , and help them being proud of their nation . 	1
PE	12395	This trend is so deeply engraved in people ' s mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned , even when some participants are facing grievous social problems . 	0
PE	12396	For most folks on Earth , the need to gather in one place , and enjoy competition with other talented people from different cultures through popular games has always been a strong motivation . 	0
PE	12397	Sporting events easing international tensions , releasing patriotic feelings 	0
PE	12398	Giving mobile phones to the unemployed 	0
PE	12399	Today , the rate of unemployment is on the rise and is seriously being debated by many . 	0
PE	12400	Some opine that the best method to minimize this problem is by providing the unemployed with hand phones that have access to the Internet . 	0
PE	12401	They also believe that this solution is the most appropriate way to utilize the public money . 	0
PE	12402	Nevertheless , I agree to this solution only to a certain degree because I feel that giving those with no work a mobile phone each is a total waste of money . 	1
PE	12403	In a positive point of view , when people without jobs have hand phones that have access to the Internet , they will be able to browse the net for more job opportunities . 	0
PE	12404	For example , they can surf the The Star Onlines ' work section to find a job that is suitable for them . 	0
PE	12405	With the help of the net , they can also do more research on the work that they have found apart from looking up on how they can prepare themselves for the job . 	0
PE	12406	Not only that , the mobile phones can also be used to make calls with the companies in which they would like to work with . 	0
PE	12407	In short , if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone , they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive . 	1
PE	12408	These feedbacks , in turn , help raise one ’ s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more . 	0
PE	12409	Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential . 	1
PE	12410	People moved due to a number of reasons , namely better educations or higher salary jobs . 	0
PE	12411	Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries ’ cultures . 	0
PE	12412	More people are migrating to other countries than ever before 	0
PE	12413	The last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries . 	0
PE	12414	Take Australia for example , immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues . 	0
PE	12415	Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows , learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values . 	0
PE	12416	However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values . 	1
PE	12417	Firstly , maintaining one ’ s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments . 	0
PE	12418	Hence , taking advice from parents , the young adult can go through obstacles easily . 	1
PE	12419	If the parents do not help him immediately , he would have to suffer more pain . 	0
PE	12420	If the government encourage the use of nuclear , solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity . 	0
PE	12421	Therefore , it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources . 	1
PE	12422	Firstly , the major source of energy today is water . 	0
PE	12423	Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source . 	0
PE	12424	To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short . 	0
PE	12425	Thus , during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India . 	0
PE	12426	Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy 	0
PE	12427	The increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past . 	0
PE	12428	It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly . 	0
PE	12429	I will analyze these areas in the essay . 	0
PE	12430	People in society must do more than paying taxes to contribute to their society . 	1
PE	12431	For instance , people should have knowledge about their own culture and history by studying at school with full concentration or reading them from books . 	0
PE	12432	On the other hand , a person has to unite with other people in the community so as to develop their nation . 	0
PE	12433	Indeed , if people in society have a strong bond with each other , society will become a peaceful place , where people are helping and sharing to each other . 	0
PE	12434	Taking everything into account , I strongly believe that being a citizen involves in a number of duties , other than paying taxes . 	1
PE	12435	On top of that , till now , there are no surveys or evidences that prove this method in effective in reducing the rate of unemployment . 	1
PE	12436	To put it in a nutshell , the suggestion of providing those who are jobless with mobile phones that are accessible to internet is not a proper and the best way to trim down the rate of unemployment . 	1
PE	12437	To illustrate this further , the money can be used to build more amenities for the public or given to the poor so that they can use it to help them earn a living . 	0
PE	12438	To conclude , the money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed . 	1
PE	12439	Nonetheless , looking from another perspective , supplying hand phones to the unemployed is a waste of the taxpayers ' money . 	0
PE	12440	This is because the money instead of being used to supply the electronic gadget can be used for other useful purposes for the country . 	0
PE	12441	Some might even go to the extent of lying that they are on unemployment to make them eligible to get the phones . 	0
PE	12442	In this context , the public ' s money is spent worthlessly . 	0
PE	12443	Furthermore , when hand phones are provided for free , many would want to take advantage of this opportunity . 	1
PE	12444	It will not be surprising that in order to obtain a mobile phone , they make themselves jobless . 	0
PE	12445	There are many advantage of these invention , telephones and email . 	0
PE	12446	Telephones and emails have made personal communication less required 	0
PE	12447	I personally disagree with this notion that these types of communication , telephones and email , made people less personal . 	1
PE	12448	Communication between people by using telephones and email made my life easier . 	1
PE	12449	To begin with , telephones and email help people , who live far away from other people , to connect each other . 	1
PE	12450	I will give several reasons to support my opinion . 	0
PE	12451	I can using telephones and email to talk or write directly to people I want to connect with . 	0
PE	12452	Unlike email , send message by using mail service could be lost and could be sent to wrong address . 	0
PE	12453	Consequently , I can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want . 	0
PE	12454	For example , right now , I am in the U . S . It is not possible to have conversation in person with my parents , who live in my country . 	0
PE	12455	I believe that studying abroad has many advantages . 	1
PE	12456	Students gain a lot out of the experience personally , academically , and culturally . 	1
PE	12457	Studies abroad and the cultural aspect of the experience 	0
PE	12458	After that I understood , I had to never judge with people ' s appearance . 	0
PE	12459	But people should be careful with what they eat , because some industrial foods are very bad for their health , so they should buy only food from well known brands . 	1
PE	12460	All in all , that ease to prepare food has improved people ’ s lives . 	1
PE	12461	And that happened mainly because of the development of the technology . 	0
PE	12462	For example , if a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend , he could just buy some food that comes with instructions . 	0
PE	12463	Normally you just need to put it into the oven and wait some time . 	0
PE	12464	Living on your own is a huge financial commitment . 	0
PE	12465	At younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job , so It can be a difficult task to pay for rent , food , utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself . 	0
PE	12466	So , I believe that living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income . 	1
PE	12467	Another advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them . 	1
PE	12468	Young adults preference on how long they should live with their parents before moving out 	0
PE	12469	As young people gets older they tend to seek more freedom and want to live on their own . 	0
PE	12470	But , the issue of what is the right age for young adults to leave their parents and start living on their own is a contentious one . 	0
PE	12471	Personally , I believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time . 	1
PE	12472	Parents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life . 	0
PE	12473	Living together develops the environment of discussing adult ' s physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents . 	0
PE	12474	Unfortunately , many people play role to cheat the others , and they try to hide their real personality with their appearance . 	0
PE	12475	This is another downside of growing up in the countryside . 	0
PE	12476	Crimes kill someone which is illegal ; nevertheless , the government use law to punish them , which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one . 	0
PE	12477	Growing up in the countryside is not such a good experience , you won ’ t know a lot of people , there are gossips everywhere , and your life will be really limited . 	1
PE	12478	If someday I have children , I ’ m absolutely sure that they will grow up in a good neighborhood of a big city and they will be very happy about it . 	1
PE	12479	" Capital punishment or the death penalty is a legal process whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime . " 	0
PE	12480	Capital punishment ; 51% countries have polished death penalty 	0
PE	12481	In the whole world , 51% countries have polished death penalty ; even , it is at 98% in Europe . 	0
PE	12482	In recently years , many countries have polished the law of the death penalty . 	0
PE	12483	However , others argue that it is not essential to control violence in society by the death penalty . 	0
PE	12484	Some people claim that without this punishment our lives would be less secure and crimes of violence would increase . 	0
PE	12485	Firstly , capital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture . 	0
PE	12486	Personally , I think it is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty because of many reasons . 	1
PE	12487	Finally , in big cities children access to media easily , so they can learn a lot of things by watching television and surfing through the net . 	1
PE	12488	Via internet they can have connection with the other children all around the world , therefor they can exchange their knowledge , they can learn different cultures . 	1
PE	12489	To sum up , although countrysides have some advantages such as fresh air , peace , and etc . Today ' s children needs somethings to entertain them , and occupy their leisure time in the best way . 	1
PE	12490	That ' s why I believe that the excellent knowledge of this job will be more significant . 	1
PE	12491	Admittedly , the ability to adapt oneself to the new environment has been proven to be part of job . 	1
PE	12492	This ability is helpful in communicating with other workmates , cooperating with other workers needs this ability , too . 	0
PE	12493	But working alone is a longer-term job than communicating , that is , the ability of adapting oneself to a new environment may be necessary for a fresh worker , but the excellent knowledge of this job will be benefit till one leave . 	0
PE	12494	Excellent knowledge is better than ability to adopt oneself 	0
PE	12495	With the rapid development of economy , the controversial of good worker ' s requirement is always in a limelight . 	0
PE	12496	A large number of people will say the ability to adapt oneself to a new environment is necessary , because it is the basic communication skill for a new worker . 	0
PE	12497	From my perspective , there is only one thing would be beneficial to company , and there is only one way to be an outstanding worker , that is possessing excellent knowledge of this job . 	1
PE	12498	Therefore , I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money , and that did influence me in my life now . 	0
PE	12499	Unfortunately , I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend . 	0
PE	12500	In my views , I agree that it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare their adult life for several reasons . 	1
PE	12501	Parents can use many methods to guide them to achieve that , for example , asking them to do some housework or clean the rooms by themselves . 	0
PE	12502	Nowadays , the society has become exceedingly competitive than ever before , parents have the responsibilitis to teach their children to survive and to be indepedent from them , just as animals teach their offspring skills of finding foods . 	0
PE	12503	Parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life 	0
PE	12504	At the beginning of the semester , I was told to buy a text book . 	0
PE	12505	Take me as an example , when I was 16 , I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own . 	0
PE	12506	Thus , it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money . 	1
PE	12507	First of all , when children get a job , they are able to earn money by themselves , instead of getting pocket money from their parents . 	0
PE	12508	By way of conclusion , it is my belief that distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases . 	1
PE	12509	However , discussions and interactions should be held via video conferencing frequently so that the joy of learning would not be diminished . 	0
PE	12510	They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life . 	0
PE	12511	It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive . 	0
PE	12512	For example , the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign . 	0
PE	12513	Thus , the possibility of the conflicts is reduced because the understanding between both parties . 	0
PE	12514	Furthermore , the tour guide are willing to help tourists to understand the culture from other countries . 	0
PE	12515	Hence , I think international tourism leads to both tension and understanding between people from different culture . 	1
PE	12516	Obviously , people are looking for the solution such as understanding each other while they encounter the conflicts caused by international tourism . 	1
PE	12517	A greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues 	0
PE	12518	In today ' s world , the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens . 	0
PE	12519	I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients . 	0
PE	12520	Therefore , society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients . 	1
PE	12521	For instance , Thomas Edison is undeniably considered as one of the greatest inventors in the 20th century since his invention ' s productivity is countless useful for mankind . 	0
PE	12522	More importantly , the more beneficial for the society his achievement is , the more successful he is considered . 	0
PE	12523	A person ' s great prosperity does not state that he has gained it ethically by himself . 	0
PE	12524	Money is undeniably pivotal , but ways of earning it is also various . 	0
PE	12525	Whether it is a personal or a social achievement , that man is laudable . 	0
PE	12526	Nevertheless , a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard-working , dedication and passion . 	1
PE	12527	It ' s such a common definition of a successful person is one who has earned a lot of money , especially in nowadays society . 	0
PE	12528	A successful person is one who has earned a lot of money 	0
PE	12529	Still , my term of a successful man is one who has certain achievements in life rather than the one with a high income . 	1
PE	12530	Each individual visualize success differently . 	0
PE	12531	People are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology ; nevertheless , behind the glamorous facade of it , what we loss will never be returned . 	1
PE	12532	The introduction of foreign language will be new to them ; however , their curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend . 	0
PE	12533	Nevertheless , it is undeniable that kids are amazing learners , and the best time to hone them is in their younger years . 	0
PE	12534	In addition , the positive impact of this strategy is beneficial to both learners and teachers . 	0
PE	12535	In this way , grasping a new language will be natural to them . 	0
PE	12536	It is certainly clear that the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages . 	1
PE	12537	Teachers will not find it difficult to make students learn such new concept in their teenage years . 	0
PE	12538	I am totally convinced that if this endeavour is properly implemented by schools , this will most likely lead to improvement of learning ability among children . 	1
PE	12539	In conclusion , the use of foreign language instruction as early as kindergarten is supported by some people ; however , there are those who disagree . 	0
PE	12540	In conclusion , if children take part in some kind of paid work with their parents ' permission , they can learn lively lessons and become mature and responsible . 	1
PE	12541	However , if children get good care and instructions from their parents , they can take advantages of the work to learn valuable things and avoid going in a wrong way . 	0
PE	12542	It ' s just like a picky mirror through which we can see the bad side of us and thus try to become more beautiful and confident . 	0
PE	12543	In conclusion , criticism is essential especially in group working but in other occasions we still need criticism . 	1
PE	12544	And it ' s kind of art to make the best use of criticism . 	0
PE	12545	You should have your own judgments too ! 	0
PE	12546	Taking criticism doesn ' t necessary mean that you have to take it all . 	0
PE	12547	In my point of view , even if you are right , criticism is still helpful because in this case it not only is a fixer , but it also serves as a practice to test you how much you know about your work . 	1
PE	12548	Doesn ' t insistence also a good character ? 	0
PE	12549	What if that I was at first right but the seemingly reasonable criticism led me to the wrong direction ? 	0
PE	12550	Computers expose children to vulgar materials . 	0
PE	12551	Virus programs , privacy breach , leak of confidential documents , cyber attacks , identity theft , frauds etc . are some of its demerits , from a countless list . 	0
PE	12552	Nanotechnology is working to make computers to the order of microscopic levels . 	0
PE	12553	From a computer as big as a room , it has now been minimized to the size of a palm . 	0
PE	12554	Along with the advancement of long-distance transportation , international tourism has boomed in the last few decades . 	0
PE	12555	By working too long , they often become tired , lazy and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy and eventually loose health and become sick . 	0
PE	12556	Moreover , they become extensively addicted to their work and become workaholic type persons . 	0
PE	12557	There is a saying in my native village , " Health is Wealth " . 	0
PE	12558	I believe many of people including me are not really considering the importance of health . 	0
PE	12559	Working Extended hours should restricted 	0
PE	12560	Working longer hours is becoming prevalent in these days . 	0
PE	12561	In my opinion , a balance between personal and professional life should be created by restricting maximum number of working hours . 	1
PE	12562	First of all , many of us would agree to the fact that people ; who prefer working longer hours , do not find time to focus on their health . 	1
PE	12563	The need for increased working hours might be because of enhanced competitive environment and desire to acquire much money and promotion . 	0
PE	12564	However , people working for extended hours have been found having adverse effects on their health and personal life . 	1
PE	12565	Based on these grounds , it seems that tourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources , and it should not be encouraged . 	0
PE	12566	Having three reasons helps us to bring up students who are well-educated , with a bright and independent mind . 	0
PE	12567	In conclusion , as a young women I want my children to get knowledge they have desire to study in order to have distinguished achievement so it has advantage not only for him or her but for society as well . 	1
PE	12568	Furthermore , this type of opportunities can raise future geniuses . 	1
PE	12569	When schools can give such kind of opportunity the students are likely do their best and succeed in their future lives which is one of the point most people get education . 	0
PE	12570	Lastly , the most important reason I support this idea is he or she can explore in an area she / he has an aptitude . 	0
PE	12571	Because of the technology of internet and air transportation , businessmen are able to handle plenty of international trade and financial transactions . 	0
PE	12572	This also helps many countries to more efficiently export their products to the world and increase their revenue . 	0
PE	12573	Besides , advanced technology enables people to enhance their living-level and health care standard . 	1
PE	12574	With the improvement of medical technology , it is obvious that the life expectancy in many countries has been significantly longer than before , and many serious diseases are under control . 	0
PE	12575	Technological progress in the past century has its negative effect 	0
PE	12576	In the past few decades , there were many remarkable achievements in technology fields that have numbers of beneficial effects on the whole society or individuals , although bringing some disadvantages to us . 	1
PE	12577	On one hand , the development of technology can prompt economic growth and the improvement of living standards . 	1
PE	12578	Scientists and engineers have invented many novel products and tools , which play an important role in economic activity . 	0
PE	12579	Digital entertainment technology allows people to enjoy playing interactive video games and watching three-dimensional movies , and this means that we could get more happiness from technology . 	0
PE	12580	On the other hand , the development of technology is likely to bring some negative effects on the environment and society . 	1
PE	12581	Technology , in the past two hundred years , has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society , such as telecommunications , manufacturing and buildings , etc . Certainly , technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives . 	0
PE	12582	Technology that widen the gap between rich and poor ? 	0
PE	12583	Personally , I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons . 	0
PE	12584	However , today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor . 	0
PE	12585	About ten years ago , mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country , only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one . 	0
PE	12586	In the first instance , the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products . 	0
PE	12587	Thus , most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements , especially the poor people . 	1
PE	12588	Today , mobile phones become a common one of household items , which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies . 	0
PE	12589	With the development of Internet , we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day . 	0
PE	12590	Secondly , technical developments improve productivity , which help people to escape from daily chores , and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life . 	1
PE	12591	Moreover , there are problems if paying teacher by grade students get . 	1
PE	12592	Teacher may not care about how they have to teach to make students understand the topics . 	0
PE	12593	Teachers may just give high grades to get higher salary . 	0
PE	12594	This problem should not be happened . 	0
PE	12595	Therefore , grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher . 	1
PE	12596	I have to wait for an hour to go to my friend house . 	0
PE	12597	The traffic in the city was too crowed . 	0
PE	12598	Last week , I went to the city center to meet my friends . 	0
PE	12599	We have large streets but few cars , so we can move easily to anywhere . 	0
PE	12600	In conclusion , I strongly feel that staying in one place is better than moving number of places . 	1
PE	12601	There were a lot of people so the environment can ' t be keep clean . 	0
PE	12602	I have been gone to some places to travel and stay for a short time , and I realize that the environment in some place isn ' t clean and fresh like my home town . 	0
PE	12603	I also love the environment in here . 	1
PE	12604	Moving some places can give to you a lot of experiences but living in one place like your hometown can make you feel comfortable about the traffic , people and of course the environment . 	1
PE	12605	If you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam . 	0
PE	12606	You cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck , even if you be a very lucky . 	0
PE	12607	Finally , you have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way . 	0
PE	12608	Undoubtedly it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam . 	0
PE	12609	These plans is done by someone who is mastered in his / her work . 	0
PE	12610	The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance . 	1
PE	12611	In the end , I think any great success need great work not great luck , even though luck is one factor in reaching goal but its impact is extraneous and we must not reckon on luck in our plans . 	1
PE	12612	Undoubtedly such people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works . 	0
PE	12613	To sum up , new technology has affected cultures of the world , and we can see many similarities in many cultures . 	1
PE	12614	For example , two days ago , I went to a Canadian restaurant , and I ate noodle , sushi , which are Chinese foods , and Greek salad . 	0
PE	12615	In fact , new technology has influences on educational system , jobs and foods in the world . 	1
PE	12616	Some people might argue that there are some cultures such as making foods which are unicq in each culture , and technology cannot affect them . 	1
PE	12617	This example shows that jobs that are related to technology are in demand in most of the countries . 	0
PE	12618	In fact , cooks can find many new food recipes easily on the Internet . 	0
PE	12619	This point has some merits on the surface ; however , many countries such as Canada , the USA , and British have many restaurants which serve many foods form different countries and cultures . 	0
PE	12620	Which do you prefer : do only what you already do well , or not . 	0
PE	12621	Those who disagree , believe that globalization contribute effectively to the global improvement of the world in many aspects . 	1
PE	12622	As a fact that the criminal is repeated second time ; also , it is regarded as the " legalized revenge " to victims ' family . 	0
PE	12623	Some people prefer to recognize globalization as a threat to ethnic and religious values of people of their country . 	1
PE	12624	They think that the idea of globalization put their inherited culture in danger of uncontrolled change and make them vulnerable against the attack of imperialistic governments . 	0
PE	12625	Globalization as a gradual change affecting all over the world is not an exception . 	0
PE	12626	Although it has undeniable effects on the economics of the world ; it has side effects which make it a controversial issue . 	0
PE	12627	Effects of globalization 	0
PE	12628	In a big city you have more qualified teachers and a better access to technology . 	1
PE	12629	In addition , they admit that globalization can be considered a chance for people of each country to promote their lifestyle through the stuffs and services imported from other countries . 	0
PE	12630	Moreover , the proponents of globalization idea point out globalization results in considerable decrease in global tension due to convergence of benefits of people of the world which is a natural consequence of globalization . 	1
PE	12631	There are many ways of teaching . 	0
PE	12632	Sports activities can improve mental health as well . 	1
PE	12633	Many studies has points out that numbers of overweight people have increased in developed countries in recent years , which mainly results from insufficient exercises . 	0
PE	12634	Although miscellaneous people may apply diverse strategies , such as reading , watching movies , or working in their gardens , I argue that the most suitable method of reducing stress for modern people is by different kinds of exercise , which can not only improve health conditions but also bring positive emotions . 	1
PE	12635	Therefore , it is necessary for many to find ways to relax . 	0
PE	12636	In modern society , people often face many difficulties under great stress . 	0
PE	12637	The best way to relax is by exercises 	0
PE	12638	The latter one is of particular importance because nowadays more and more people are suffer from obesity . 	0
PE	12639	Moreover , these sports can also strengthen muscles and lessen surplus adipose tissues in human body . 	0
PE	12640	Any kinds of sports , such as jogging , swimming , or playing basketball , can effectively facilitate human respiration and circulation system . 	0
PE	12641	It is not surprised that exercise play a crucial role in ameliorating physical health . 	1
PE	12642	While I was in senior high school , my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas . 	0
PE	12643	For instance , my father had a a breakdown several years ago due to his stressful job . 	0
PE	12644	After several weeks off his body was restored , now he has reduced the tempo of his lifestyle and is doing fine . 	0
PE	12645	In my opinion , it is very important to live life at a slower pace , because living in a hurry comes along with several disadvantages . 	1
PE	12646	First , living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health . 	1
PE	12647	If you are always hurried and you do not take a certain time off , your body will react to your stressful lifestyle . 	0
PE	12648	Many hardworking people have diseases , like the burn-out syndrome , because their bodies cannot hold the pace . 	0
PE	12649	Rush vs Slower Pace 	0
PE	12650	Modern technologies and globalization have increased the speed of life in the past decades tremendously . 	0
PE	12651	However , while the majority of people live on the fast lane , others decide to reduce the speed and take their time . 	0
PE	12652	To draw an entire picture , we have to consider both the advantages and disadvantages of this increased speed of life and ask our self which way of life is better . 	0
PE	12653	However , some cases occupy a crucial reason to do a criminality in society such unemployment . 	0
PE	12654	In my view , the main focus is decreasing a level of unemployment to avoid a criminal act . 	0
PE	12655	Many well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably . 	0
PE	12656	Secondly , cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive , so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs . 	0
PE	12657	Many baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport , for instance . 	0
PE	12658	In conclusion , it seems to me that the guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence . 	1
PE	12659	Nowadays , computers enable people to prepare presentations , draw complex graphs and pictures , document thesis in a simple though efficient way . 	0
PE	12660	As an example , students preparing for delivering speech on a certain topic can browse through internet to learn each and every minute details of the subject matter . 	0
PE	12661	It ' s hard to get everything at a same place unless children are not familiar with computers . 	0
PE	12662	Some students enjoy taking part in some research . 	0
PE	12663	For instance , some Asians are seeking individualism , previously denied by many Asian countries , due to the fact that they have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies , which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English . 	0
PE	12664	On the other hand , there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities . 	1
PE	12665	Firstly , the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries . 	0
PE	12666	Obviously , police officers can force a criminal to surrender , because they have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public . 	0
PE	12667	As a result , some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence . 	1
PE	12668	On the one hand , I agree that a police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun . 	0
PE	12669	An obvious example of this happens in The United State , a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon , while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him . 	0
PE	12670	Some inhabitants argue that this case appears because the guns are always used by a police to solve a criminal act . 	0
PE	12671	Personally , I tend to disagree with this statement , while I believe that other factors contribute a slight incline level of violence . 	0
PE	12672	Do guns can really increase the level of violence ? 	0
PE	12673	The number of criminality is increase rapidly throughout the world . 	0
PE	12674	Therefore , we can commence to agree that certain facilities are beneficial to students . 	1
PE	12675	Some people believe that this has brought more problems than benefits . 	0
PE	12676	The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that the more advanced facilities we have , the more chances we can increase our knowledge . 	0
PE	12677	Problems and benefits of international tourism 	0
PE	12678	Therefore , past obviously saves ourselves a bunch of failures and times . 	1
PE	12679	Secondly , people ' s success in the past is as significant as those mistakes . 	1
PE	12680	As everyone ' s life is too short to risk trying anything without any prepare , we all should learn about other ' s mistakes so that we can avoid making the same ones . 	0
PE	12681	Each mistake , from the smallest to the bigger one , is a treasure of experience , which , if we can make full use of , will make us well-prepared for many complicated situations of our life . 	0
PE	12682	Although it is true that life changes rapidly , there are many things in the past that we can learn about , such as mistakes , success and knowledge in many fields of study . 	1
PE	12683	First of all , the predecessors ' mistakes are the first thing that we should consider when learning about the past . 	0
PE	12684	Success and knowledge 	0
PE	12685	Many people think that " Past has nothing to do with present , as time never stops , the next generations are completely different from the predecessors " . 	0
PE	12686	Improving facilities is the best way 	0
PE	12687	If the predecessors ' mistakes are the indirect way that leads us to the goals , others ' accomplishment can be served as the direct way . 	0
PE	12688	By looking into the ways other people use to achieve their targets , we have the chance to make those mine , put them into practice and , of course , be successful like them . 	0
PE	12689	Some people tend to prefer that schools should invest in renewing facilities , while other seem to believe that famous teachers is more conducive to students . 	0
PE	12690	In order to meet the needs of tourists , local governments are likely to build more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions , which may result in the destruction of natural habitats . 	0
PE	12691	The option to work or study from home is advantage or disadvantage 	0
PE	12692	Undoubtedly this is an era of internet which impacts one ' s personal as well as professional life . 	0
PE	12693	The effect is seen more on the developed countries where people choose to work or study from home instead of going to office or university . 	0
PE	12694	Some consider this approach to be an advantage while others reject this as a disadvantage . 	0
PE	12695	Both the points of views will be discussed in order . 	0
PE	12696	On the one hand , the benefit that professionals or students get by connecting from home is enormous . 	0
PE	12697	For one , it helps working people to maintain work life balance . 	0
PE	12698	The best example is the new mother who can join her work as well as take care of her baby . 	0
PE	12699	People also get the desired flexibility in terms of working hours . 	0
PE	12700	For students too , studying from home is an attractive option . 	0
PE	12701	For instance , the Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafés , hospital and shopping street . 	0
PE	12702	Secondly , the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender . 	1
PE	12703	Therefore , the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented . 	1
PE	12704	A large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases . 	0
PE	12705	Recent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking . 	0
PE	12706	Firstly , it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time . 	0
PE	12707	It is agreed that the move will do more good by looking at the quality of health and image of a nation in long run . 	1
PE	12708	As a result , some businesses prohibit smoking in their premises and even some governments restrict smoking in public area . 	0
PE	12709	The awareness on harmful effects from smoking among the general public has put much pressure on the government and private sectors . 	0
PE	12710	Prohibit public smoking ? 	0
PE	12711	Once student ' s starts earning , they might not like to go back to studies where they would lose their financial independence . 	0
PE	12712	They might even find it difficult to adapt to education environment . 	0
PE	12713	There is also a risk of student never going back to university or higher education . 	0
PE	12714	Probably some might take some short term courses instead of proper and complete university education , which will help them to get a better job and salaries . 	0
PE	12715	This might only help them in a short run as it is a known fact that to make a reasonable career in longer runs , one needs a proper and higher qualification . 	0
PE	12716	In my view point , I would agree to idea of taking a break before starting higher education . 	1
PE	12717	Students who take break , gain lot of benefits by traveling around the places or by working . 	1
PE	12718	They tend to contribute more due to their real world experiences which makes them more mature . 	0
PE	12719	On top of that , due to the lack of genuine passion on the work which was not of their option , there is a greater possibility for their performance standard to dwindle at their workplace . 	0
PE	12720	Apart from that , not all elderly workers are physically well . 	0
PE	12721	I , for one , strongly agree that age should be set as a criterion for people to retire at the aforementioned age due to several reasons that I shall discuss below . 	1
PE	12722	First and foremost , if senior workers dominate the working sector , there will be lesser job opportunities for the fresh graduates . 	0
PE	12723	As a result , most of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for . 	1
PE	12724	To illustrate this further , a medical graduate might find it very disheartened when he had to spend around five precious years studying medicine and at the end of the day , he will have to take up another profession rather than doctor due to the insufficient job opportunities available . 	0
PE	12725	Should people be forced to stop working ? 	0
PE	12726	The appropriate age at which a person should stop working is now a much debated issue in the society . 	0
PE	12727	Some opine that people should be given the option to choose when they want to call it a day while others oppose this notion . 	0
PE	12728	In my personal point of view , the right age for a person to retire should be around 60 years old . 	1
PE	12729	In this case , the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them , so that they can have the chance to get back to work . 	0
PE	12730	They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support . 	0
PE	12731	In conclusion , my point of view is that , although the government should provide help for the disadvantaged people , direct financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity . 	1
PE	12732	After all , it is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again . 	0
PE	12733	In summary , students should find interesting subjects and acquire general knowledge to prepare higher education at tertiary education . 	1
PE	12734	Therefore , schools should be responsible for their future and protect them . 	1
PE	12735	Those activities have proven that women can also do the men ' s works . 	0
PE	12736	For instance , you sometimes need knowledge about physics to read a text on chemistry . 	0
PE	12737	In addition , although textbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects , in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects . 	0
PE	12738	Science today , for example , is said to be more and more specialized , but in order to solve a problem scientists have to combine knowledge from chemistry to physics . 	0
PE	12739	General education plays a significant role in specialized education . 	0
PE	12740	This might result in limited choices in the future . 	0
PE	12741	They might avoid tough courses , but instead attend mainly Mickey Mouse courses and enjoy themselves too much . 	0
PE	12742	Last but not least , students have tendency to shun difficulties . 	0
PE	12743	Therefore , high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university . 	1
PE	12744	Moreover , I did not have to worry about costs and other things , I just had fun and learned . 	0
PE	12745	For example , when I was young I just came home from school and then I would took my bike or soccer ball and go out and play with my friends in my neighborhood . 	0
PE	12746	Next , students should obtain knowledge from a variety of academic fields . 	0
PE	12747	For instance , a would-be mathematician student may be strongly intrigued by philosophy and make a success in the field . 	0
PE	12748	We can see now that women tend to work in various fields which in the past normally done by men such as being engineers , and dealing with machines . 	0
PE	12749	I think , however , students should study a broad range of subjects from literature to mathematics . 	1
PE	12750	They believe this motivates students to study . 	0
PE	12751	Some people state that high schools should allow students to study what they want to . 	0
PE	12752	High schools must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum 	0
PE	12753	They should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects , otherwise they might miss valuable encounter with the subject . 	0
PE	12754	To begin with , students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested . 	1
PE	12755	In addition , it should be to some extent paternalistic to prevent students from avoiding hurdles . 	1
PE	12756	I believe that tertiary education should make students prepare for specialization at university . 	1
PE	12757	In many societies , choice of a job depends on the size of the salary offered . 	0
PE	12758	Factor of choosing a career . 	0
PE	12759	To begin with , I agree that in order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well . 	1
PE	12760	Nevertheless , while I admit that the salary is very pivotal factor , I claim that there are other equally vital aspects that need to be considered in this regard . 	1
PE	12761	People , for instance , who don ' t like their co-workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs , despite of a high salary . 	0
PE	12762	However , aspects such as : friendly colleagues , environment and work-place condition , sometimes , have even more impact on person ' s happiness and quality of life . 	0
PE	12763	Further and even more importantly , most of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements , skills and the position they reach . 	0
PE	12764	In this sense , it is also one very salient proof of the accuracy of my position . 	0
PE	12765	For example , people , who work in monotonous jobs , where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied , even though they have a very good salaries . 	0
PE	12766	In other words , career promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are , likely , more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary . 	1
PE	12767	In today ' s world , the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens . 	0
PE	12768	A greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues 	0
PE	12769	In addition , the basic economic course can also help with the students when they go to college . 	1
PE	12770	I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions . 	1
PE	12771	Therefore , society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients . 	1
PE	12772	I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients . 	0
PE	12773	In my opinion , there is nothing more important than health in a human ' s life and the happiness and welfare come with health . 	0
PE	12774	The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society . 	1
PE	12775	For example , the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign . 	0
PE	12776	Therefore , a government ' s role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people ' s lives . 	0
PE	12777	He do a lot of exercise in football field every day , so it is not for which he is luckier than me . 	0
PE	12778	Moreover , we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful . 	1
PE	12779	I mean , when you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success . 	0
PE	12780	For example in football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal . 	0
PE	12781	Statically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty . 	0
PE	12782	But I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me . 	0
PE	12783	On the other hand , universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities , and this could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects . 	1
PE	12784	Government should take interim measures , to regulate admission process for university courses which enables every student to get benefit . 	0
PE	12785	In conclusion , I am firmly supporting the view , that every student either male or female should be given fairly equal opportunity to purse their education in all university subjects , provided they should meet the required qualifications rather than putting limitations based on their gender . 	1
PE	12786	These machines reduce the physical work done by humans . 	0
PE	12787	Machines - positive or negative for humans 	0
PE	12788	It is felt by many that the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans since machines decrease the work done by people . 	1
PE	12789	For example , in many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days . 	0
PE	12790	Some people think that this is a positive development while others believe it to be disadvantageous for humans . 	0
PE	12791	Both sides will be critiqued before a reasoned conclusion is reached . 	0
PE	12792	Mobile phones are not out of expectation . 	0
PE	12793	First of all , almost everything that changed our lifestyle a lot will also cause some social problems . 	1
PE	12794	What is worse , some students utilize their cell phones as an effective cheating tools in examinations in which they can send and receive answers by texting each other . 	0
PE	12795	Speaking loudly on the phone in public areas , such as schools , libraries and hospitals appears to be very impolite and offensive . 	0
PE	12796	Nowadays , the popularity of mobile phones has brought about a lot of convenience but at the meanwhile a variety of problems as well , such as social , medical and technical problems . 	0
PE	12797	Effects of mobile phones 	0
PE	12798	In this essay , I would like to analyze these three issues in order to support my viewpoint . 	0
PE	12799	However , I do not think these disadvantages will outweigh the advantages brought by cell phones . 	1
PE	12800	Children are privileged to have these abilities because they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances . 	0
PE	12801	They are more abstract , requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched . 	0
PE	12802	It is also worth mentioning that some harmful effects on our health are lethal . 	1
PE	12803	Nevertheless , it is not impossible to solve these problems , as long as some regulations and rules can be effectively implemented . 	0
PE	12804	Success needs us to work hard and sacrifice more whether we choose to study alone or with group . 	0
PE	12805	In fact , I agree with the idea of studying a lone since it helps me to focus more and establish my personality . 	1
PE	12806	To conclude , there are many ways to study and it is our right to choose which is suitable for our characters whether alone or with group . 	0
PE	12807	Personally , when I fix my study plan with a specific time and finish it on time , it improves my ability in the future to become more precise and careful . 	0
PE	12808	Also , it motivates us to be accurate in our work in the future . 	0
PE	12809	For example , answering our homework alone encourages us to be more responsible and independent . 	0
PE	12810	Additionally , we are building our personalities when we study alone . 	1
PE	12811	To illustrate this point , I can write about my own experience . 	0
PE	12812	We can talk to them because they listen to us , more than some people will ever do . 	0
PE	12813	In this way , the crime rate is reduced and society becomes a peaceful place , so the country will develop at a rapid pace . 	0
PE	12814	Furthermore , being a citizen in society should protect the country ' s culture and history . 	0
PE	12815	Some people think that pets should be treated like family members . 	0
PE	12816	Cats and dogs are the most common pets but there are birds , tortoises and fishes as well . 	0
PE	12817	Pets have always been essential in our society . 	0
PE	12818	Our useful friends 	0
PE	12819	Similarly to friends , indeed , they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone . 	0
PE	12820	First , pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are . 	1
PE	12821	The issue is controversial but in my opinion , pets should be treated like human beings for different reasons . 	1
PE	12822	However , others argue that they are just animals and aren ' t able to think like us . 	0
PE	12823	First and foremost , today entertainment is easier for people to enjoy than ever before . 	0
PE	12824	The fact is that such news media as televisions , radios , or newspapers are bringing many news on entertainment sector from all over the world to everybody . 	0
PE	12825	It is widely seen that news media not only brings people entertainment , but also polishes up people ' knowledge . 	1
PE	12826	Therefore , it seems not unreasonable to suggest that this is a positive development . 	0
PE	12827	Many people consider that the drawbacks of this phenomenon outweigh its merits . 	0
PE	12828	However , it is possible that this idea is not completely true . 	0
PE	12829	The popularity of news media 	0
PE	12830	Nowadays news media have become more and more popular . 	0
PE	12831	People can sit in front of their televisions and watch whatever they want , from musical concerts to live football match . 	0
PE	12832	This is a convenient way of relaxation after hard work . 	0
PE	12833	Through face-to-face communication , teachers can also pinpoint the weaknesses of each student and therefore , adjusting and tailoring his or her teaching methodology to meet the levels or the demands of those students . 	0
PE	12834	Admittedly , the computer can show whether an answer to a particular question is right or wrong but it cannot give as an in-depth explanation as a human teacher can . 	1
PE	12835	As a result , information from those sources is subject to question . 	1
PE	12836	Much information as the Internet may provide , most of the sources are unjustified by experts . 	0
PE	12837	On the other hand , critics of this idea maintain that although the educational benefits that the Internet may yield are undeniable , there still remain certain shortcomings . 	0
PE	12838	Internet and computer also offer a more comprehensive access to knowledge , ranging from visual to aural stimuli , which make learning an ever enjoyable experience , especially for children . 	0
PE	12839	Central to the supporting arguments of this issue is the idea that the global online network is the inexhaustible source of information , which definitely exceeds the fund of knowledge that any veteran teacher can accumulate . 	1
PE	12840	This idea may point out to two main directions , both of which present different arguments . 	0
PE	12841	With the number of technological advances growing apace , it is generally believed that Internet and computers will supplant the traditional role of teachers in a not too distant future . 	0
PE	12842	Computers replace human teachers 	0
PE	12843	This is a problem that suffers all of us everyday . 	0
PE	12844	At the end , there is no time for call to our parents or friends . 	0
PE	12845	Television is the culprit for destroying communication between friends & family 	0
PE	12846	It is very hard to find a home that does not have a television . 	0
PE	12847	Nowadays , number of television channels and programs are increasing everyday . 	0
PE	12848	Unfortunately , most of people do not have a plan for make a limitation or schedule for watching television . 	1
PE	12849	I agree with that idea that television devastate families ties . 	1
PE	12850	In spite of enjoying watching television shows , it is really time consuming task . 	1
PE	12851	Emergence of new television channels or shows are not surprising . 	0
PE	12852	We kill time by tracking these channels so at the end of the day we understand it is late for doing any other activities . 	0
PE	12853	many people argue about learning their children the financial responsibility in young ages or in adulthood . 	0
PE	12854	One of the best characteristics of a mature adult is responsibility , specially in financially matters . 	0
PE	12855	For instance , I recall my first trip to a zoo , at age eight . 	0
PE	12856	I was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated . 	0
PE	12857	I can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo . 	0
PE	12858	They beat them up because they did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals . 	0
PE	12859	In conclusion , I strongly believe that we have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible . 	1
PE	12860	Scientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals . 	1
PE	12861	Moreover , many zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them . 	1
PE	12862	So it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues . 	1
PE	12863	To clarify my point I would like to say a memory from my childhood , when I was at age 7 my father gave me monthly money to buy thing that I liked . 	0
PE	12864	Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject . 	0
PE	12865	Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children . 	0
PE	12866	Should teenagers learn all school subjects / focus on one subject 	0
PE	12867	Presently , it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school . 	0
PE	12868	The benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized . 	1
PE	12869	In the first place , with some basic knowledge of diverse fields , students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future . 	0
PE	12870	While , others claim that studying only one subject is more effective . 	0
PE	12871	Before rendering my own opinion , I will explore sides of this topic . 	0
PE	12872	Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate . 	0
PE	12873	In students ' point of view , the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes . 	0
PE	12874	If it is a crucial win to acclaim a trophy , you will be " on site " to witness and celebrate the victory . 	0
PE	12875	Furthermore , it can be an exclusive experience . 	0
PE	12876	It can be unforgettable moments in your life . 	1
PE	12877	The first important point that I want to make is that sociologists found that our characteristics and personality forms early in life , even though when we are not borne . 	0
PE	12878	In conclusion , watch a football match on television it is comfortable and pleasing , but watching the match live at the stadium is more enjoyable . 	1
PE	12879	You can watch it at home , but " easy come , easy go " , you will quickly forget it , like a movie . 	0
PE	12880	Second , watching a live football game is an exceptional experience . 	1
PE	12881	You can cherish your experience for a long time . 	0
PE	12882	I firmly believe that the zoo is so useful for the earth . 	1
PE	12883	The tickets to get in the stadium may be a little expensive , but you will gain much more entertainment value from the game . 	0
PE	12884	If the zoo has a large number of both national and foreign tourists , it will receive a great deal of money . 	0
PE	12885	That also make money flow , and then economics become better . 	0
PE	12886	It benefits to a certain country . 	1
PE	12887	In conclusion , the zoo not only saves animals in danger of extinction , but also helps people around the world have better lives . 	1
PE	12888	For example , when I face my parents , I can ' t speak out every idea and express consecutively . 	0
PE	12889	They may stop me , speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say . 	0
PE	12890	Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation . 	0
PE	12891	E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive . 	1
PE	12892	On the whole , to compare to all ways of communication , I really think that e-mail is the greatest way for major people to use . 	1
PE	12893	Its convenience saves our time . 	1
PE	12894	Additionally , honesty is necessary for every conversation and also fluency can ' t be missing for a persuasive expression . 	0
PE	12895	They know something which are not incorporated in such materials as books and webpages . 	0
PE	12896	Hence I , in my class , often communicate with my teacher to find a coordinated answer to a my faced problem , and my classmates are so accustomed to communicating with the teacher . 	0
PE	12897	In addition , the learning with a teacher makes us bear more burdens of studies cause they assign us homework , Nevertheless , I prefer to learn with a teacher rather than learn by myself . 	1
PE	12898	Firstly , The distinguishing fact of the learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies . 	1
PE	12899	In other words , when we encounter difficulty in our study which we can not make out , that asking the difficulty from our teacher is propitious way for us to solve it instantly . 	0
PE	12900	In addition , professors and teachers have much experience and knowledge , and are so dextrous with letting students understand their study . 	0
PE	12901	Learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself . 	0
PE	12902	Every person learn in their own manner which they think that is most expedient to them . 	0
PE	12903	As for the learning by yourself , it has some certain profit . 	0
PE	12904	It gives you a chance to concentrate on what you learn cause there is no one who distracts your attention in presence of you , and your learning becomes more profound . 	0
PE	12905	For example , if you want to learn driving a car or some jobs like medicine and engineering and some sports like skiing and swimming , you ' ll have to find a teacher . 	0
PE	12906	There are some practical subjects that you can only learn them with a teacher or an instructor . 	1
PE	12907	By the way , if you are going to learn some things by yourself , you may learn and understand them incorrectly ! 	0
PE	12908	It ' s almost impossible and inefficient to learn those things on your own . 	0
PE	12909	There are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher because I won ' t have to spend extra money for a teacher and my time will not be wasted either because of going to classes . 	1
PE	12910	For example , from my own experiences , after I had started learning playing the guitar without a teacher , I got used to wrong habits regarding strumming and tempo , but after finding and learning with a tutor and identifying and eliminating those incorrect habits , I was able to play properly . 	0
PE	12911	I can utilize them as tutorials for many things . 	0
PE	12912	In today ' s world there are many great and useful sources available like books , electronic books , the internet and TV and satellite . 	0
PE	12913	In sum , sometimes it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own . 	1
PE	12914	For instance , I can learn English or other languages by a lot of helpful books and many online websites . 	0
PE	12915	Is it necessary for children or not ? 	0
PE	12916	Learning a foreign language is necessary for children to strengthen their ability to learn . 	0
PE	12917	Thereby students in the beginning of their education can learn faster and easier in compare to a young one to understand a foreign language . 	0
PE	12918	They can easily understand the language structure and memorize the vocabularies . 	0
PE	12919	Learning that not only help them to improve their minds and memories , but can extend their visions about the other countries . 	1
PE	12920	First , the ability of Learning in the childhood period is more powerful than other periods of life . 	0
PE	12921	For example , I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn ' t have enough parking lots for the cars . 	0
PE	12922	So , with the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own . 	0
PE	12923	On the other hand by advertising companies , businesses , firms and individuals promote their goods and services . 	1
PE	12924	Thanks to ads we learn about new products , we can compare them and choose what ’ s the best for us . 	0
PE	12925	These days , not only many businesses , but also governments have to rely on advertising . 	1
PE	12926	For example , tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic ' s economy . 	0
PE	12927	In order to promote the country ' s attractions , the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers . 	0
PE	12928	Only well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country . 	0
PE	12929	In conclusion , I think that modern society needs advertising . 	1
PE	12930	Ads will keep us well informed about new products and services , but we should also bear in mind that advertising cigarettes and alcohol will definitely affect our children in negative way . 	1
PE	12931	Should good people are rewarded and bad people are punished in movies or dramas ? 	0
PE	12932	When we watch movies or dramas , some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished . 	0
PE	12933	If we follow just one wing of my life i . e . , studying as a student , after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn ' t have any motivation . 	0
PE	12934	Moreover , they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments . 	1
PE	12935	So , social activities have same rights to receive monetary support . 	1
PE	12936	In my opinion , social groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment . 	0
PE	12937	Thus social activities can help them to be familiar with other ' s mind and different environment . 	0
PE	12938	As a practical epitome , students should be prepared to present in society after their graduation . 	0
PE	12939	Second , besides the academic knowledge , the awareness of social behavior is an important factor for human ' s life . 	0
PE	12940	As a result , sports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health . 	1
PE	12941	In my perspective , more friends and new experience inspire the feeling of happiness and excitement in me . 	0
PE	12942	Such activities can help us to pick up with other students and have more friends . 	0
PE	12943	Living with a roommate saves me a lot of money . 	1
PE	12944	If you have roommates , you can split the rent and utilities among them . 	0
PE	12945	As far as I am concerned , I prefer to live with a roommate . 	1
PE	12946	This is because it saves me money , enables me to socialize , and allows me to get help . 	1
PE	12947	Each makes different decisions . 	0
PE	12948	Some people choose to live alone for privacy , while others choose to live with a roommate for practical reasons . 	0
PE	12949	Living with a roommate is better than Living alone 	0
PE	12950	Many single people have difficulties deciding whether to live with a roommate or to live alone . 	0
PE	12951	This means you can get more for less . 	0
PE	12952	For example , last year , I shared a room off-campus with my friend , and we decided to split the rent and heating bills into half : I was able to save about fifty dollars for heating , and two hundred dollars for rent monthly . 	0
PE	12953	If the address is wrong , then you will know right away . 	0
PE	12954	We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address . 	0
PE	12955	Technology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day . 	0
PE	12956	E-mail or Voice mail Versus Telephone or face to face 	0
PE	12957	Voice mail , e-mail , telephone or just traditional way : face-to-face . 	0
PE	12958	Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much . 	0
PE	12959	Everyone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication . 	1
PE	12960	However , I prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons : convenience , honest expression and fluency in communicating . 	1
PE	12961	For instance , if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth , no matter how far it is , you can keep contact . 	0
PE	12962	You can talk to others from thousands mile . 	0
PE	12963	Moreover , he is still in-touch with some of his classmates and sometimes they get together and share their childhood memories . 	0
PE	12964	For example , my father ' s best moments in his life are in his school years . 	0
PE	12965	There is only one life and one childhood and people should live their childhood thoroughly . 	0
PE	12966	In other words , childhood is , indeed , the most happiest moments in a person ' s life . 	1
PE	12967	Second , childhood is the period where people go to school and learn . 	0
PE	12968	Also , people are most creative when they were children , children imagine new things and games just to have fun and be happy . 	1
PE	12969	There you learn , to find your first love , to make new long-lasting friendships and of-course you will have a lot of fun . 	0
PE	12970	Therefore , school memories are one of the best memories in a person ' s life . 	1
PE	12971	In conclusion , I strongly agree with notion that dancing is an important part of culture because dancing are represent to believe of people . 	1
PE	12972	I felt that people around me happy and group of santas also happy to see people happy . 	0
PE	12973	For instance , I have seen many western movies that when a kingdom have visitor from another kingdom , king or queen would dance to show a splendid of their kingdom culture . 	0
PE	12974	Secondly , dancing can represent to civilization of that culture . 	1
PE	12975	All this is a civilization of their culture . 	0
PE	12976	The way of movement , the way that they costume and also a music while they dance . 	0
PE	12977	And dancing is one of that ways . 	1
PE	12978	Thirdly , many culture , people have many ways to entertain themselves . 	0
PE	12979	For example , many event , such as christmas , last christmas I went to mall to buy gifts , and I was entertained by group of people in santa custom dancing in christmas song . 	0
PE	12980	Both people who see and dance also have a good time . 	0
PE	12981	But if the good people are not always rewarded , we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story . 	0
PE	12982	His habits may be totally different from theirs , his behavior may be inappropriate , but they will have to live with him or even share a room , in order to have less expenses . 	0
PE	12983	Living with such a person may be a huge problem for the young adults . 	0
PE	12984	When the co-tenant do not share their interests and points of view , they will not be able to ask him for advice . 	0
PE	12985	To clarify , my younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of . 	0
PE	12986	In conclusion , I reckon that for the young adults it will be better to live with their parents , because of the benefits they will have . 	1
PE	12987	They will not need to worry about financial problems or if they will get on well with their roommate . 	1
PE	12988	Next , technology destroys the language . 	1
PE	12989	At first , I tried to go through all the instructions but , soon , I gave up because I found out that it is time-consuming and there are too many things to learn . 	0
PE	12990	However , even though I used it for couple months , I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently . 	0
PE	12991	For instance , I use new Iphone which I personally think is great . 	0
PE	12992	What are even worse , young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions . 	0
PE	12993	This has gotten worse with twitter , myspace , and facebook . 	0
PE	12994	Because people try to type as fast as they are talking , they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language . 	0
PE	12995	Ever since people used computers or cellphones to chat with others , they created their own language to communicate . 	0
PE	12996	Moreover , if we let them do anything they can to just make a profit , they will produce products with low qualities and high prices , therefore they might hit consumer ' s life . 	1
PE	12997	For instance , a few months ago it was broadcast from TV that a company which produced baby milk , sold milk which did not have quality and it caused a few babies die . 	0
PE	12998	Firstly , if there is not any control on the businesses and they are permitted to do everything they want , they will threaten the beings ' life such as human , animals and plants . 	1
PE	12999	As every day we read and hear in televisions and newspapers that some factories hit the environment by their toxic substances . 	0
PE	13000	However , I completely disagree with the idea that businesses should be allowed to do anything they want to make a profit . 	1
PE	13001	With this permission they are allowed to hit and damage everything for just making a profit . 	1
PE	13002	Businesses should be only concerned about making profits . 	0
PE	13003	There is no doubt that companies , factories and businesses establish to provide products which are people ' s need and make a profit for their managers . 	0
PE	13004	Whenever I met a difficulty , I would reach him for consulting . 	0
PE	13005	Because he has many experiences , I could save enormous time in finding solution . 	0
PE	13006	First of all , as parents are involved in the same environment , they could thus support much more to their children , such as domain knowledge and industry-related information . 	1
PE	13007	For example , my father is a software programmer , and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge . 	0
PE	13008	Whether to choose a job which is similar to parents ' job or not , different people may hold different opinions . 	0
PE	13009	As far as I am concerned , I think choosing the job that is similar to parents ' jobs could benefit to one ' s career . 	1
PE	13010	In conclusion , all companies , factories and businesses should be monitored by governments and executive , and they do not have to let do anything they want just due to making profit . 	1
PE	13011	They can hit both the environment and human ' s life easily . 	1
PE	13012	Its advantages will outweigh disadvantages as long as the factories dispose their waste and pollution in the correct way . 	0
PE	13013	In conclusion , installation of manufacturing plant is a trend of industrialization for many countries . 	0
PE	13014	In fact most problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well . 	0
PE	13015	Therefore , how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it . 	1
PE	13016	However , it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society . 	0
PE	13017	For instance , in some industrial cities , a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems , such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances . 	0
PE	13018	It is true that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry , such as water pollution , overcrowded traffic and medical problems . 	0
PE	13019	Apart from the one I have mentioned above , another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy . 	0
PE	13020	If I can avoid being a sluggish person , I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully . 	0
PE	13021	I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam because I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place ; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test . 	0
PE	13022	Therefore , we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives . 	1
PE	13023	I favor the former ; that is , I prefer to live in a higher pace condition . 	1
PE	13024	The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks , and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam . 	0
PE	13025	Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks , while others seem to prefer the opposite position . 	0
PE	13026	After deeply pondering over this issue , I also develop my own perspective . 	0
PE	13027	Living in a higher pace is better 	0
PE	13028	There is a hotly debated issue over whether people have to live at a higher or lower pace , and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity . 	0
PE	13029	In conclusion , I admittedly and strongly agree that the merits of email and messaging have reduced amount of ours time to communicate to . 	1
PE	13030	Besides , we need to make sure for the real gathering with our colleague . 	1
PE	13031	In conclusion , i can certainly state that I would rather prefer working in a large company than in a small one . 	1
PE	13032	As well as learning new skills in my field from these workshops . 	0
PE	13033	I have different reasons to hold that , such as having a better chance to find work , having a better salary and having the opportunity to travel around the world to attend international conferences . 	1
PE	13034	For instance , common sense would tell us that a famous and international known company won ' t give the same salary as a small local company . 	0
PE	13035	In other words , this means that the company can give more salaries to its employees . 	0
PE	13036	large companies have an international reputation , as they organize international conferences , meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people . 	1
PE	13037	Third , I love travelling around the world . 	0
PE	13038	It is undeniable that when they are given the opportunity to express themselves , most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies . 	0
PE	13039	First and foremost , if there is control over artists ' ideas , they will definitely lose their sense of creativity in the long run . 	0
PE	13040	In short , without any limitations , there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists . 	1
PE	13041	For example , paintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times . 	0
PE	13042	Artists in most countries are given the freedom to express their thoughts in whatever they do . 	0
PE	13043	Artists ' freedom to express ideas 	0
PE	13044	I however , agree to this only to a certain extent and believe that the artists must be given freedom so that they will produce some really marvelous masterpiece . 	1
PE	13045	Nevertheless , some argue that there should be government restrictions in order to limit their opinions . 	0
PE	13046	Today , many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries . 	0
PE	13047	Furthermore , it is every human ' s right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation . 	0
PE	13048	Although research could bring funding and latest achievements in the field , the research takes up too much teaching time . 	1
PE	13049	As far as I am concerned , professors should spend more time on preparing courses than research . 	1
PE	13050	The precondition of doing research by professors 	0
PE	13051	Nowadays , many professors conduct research while teaching in colleges or universities . 	0
PE	13052	If professors spend a lot of time on research , he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced , which may decrease the quality of classes . 	0
PE	13053	The reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting-edged technologies . 	0
PE	13054	However , living and studying overseas gives the individual a new perspective on the subject that is studied or in general life . 	1
PE	13055	In conclusion , there are many difficulties a student might face when studying and living overseas . 	1
PE	13056	In this way , professors should provide well-preparation courses to convey the state-of-art knowledge for college and university students . 	0
PE	13057	Therefore , professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research . 	1
PE	13058	Finally , human need some crucial things to continue their life , and most of them are industrial such as medicine . 	0
PE	13059	Dwelling is one of the most important human needs after food which is undeniable . 	0
PE	13060	We need farmland to grow crops such as wheat and corn , and there is no doubt that without food people cannot alive for more than some weeks . 	0
PE	13061	Firstly , day by day population is increasing , so human needs for food is increasing as well . 	0
PE	13062	Secondly , people need shelters to protect themselves from mother nature such as wind and flood and wild animals , so they need land to build their houses on it . 	1
PE	13063	Therefore , farmlands are vital for human life . 	1
PE	13064	Nowadays there are some issues which many countries and nations are concern about that . 	0
PE	13065	Some people think that human needs for farmland , housing and industry are more 	0
PE	13066	From my point of view although endangered animals are important , human needs should be considered more . 	1
PE	13067	Two of the most important of them are rate of increasing population and endangered plants and animals . 	0
PE	13068	Thanks to the economical online-teaching , universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains . 	0
PE	13069	Nevertheless , opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates . 	1
PE	13070	Distance-learning vs . attending school in person 	0
PE	13071	A matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance-learning should be promoted as much as possible , or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees . 	0
PE	13072	From my perspective , online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions . 	1
PE	13073	To begin with , distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world . 	1
PE	13074	In earlier times , students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby , regardless of any differences in teaching facilities , teacher ' s qualifications or the school reputation . 	0
PE	13075	Now , however , students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide . 	0
PE	13076	Furthermore , the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students . 	0
PE	13077	Consequently , educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios . 	1
PE	13078	I agree with this viewpoint to some extent . 	0
PE	13079	Admittedly , in concerning the social relationship with peers , some may support that children should watch TV and movies for their rich contents that could give children some topics in conversation . 	1
PE	13080	How can anyone expect children could do well at school if they have those abnormal behaviors ? 	0
PE	13081	It is obvious that there are many programs on TV or movies that are harmful to children in metal and physical health . 	1
PE	13082	What ' s even worse , according to some statistics , there are more and more children have violent tendency , and the reports attribute this to TV programs and movies . 	0
PE	13083	Recently , more and more children smoke because they imitate actors ' behaviors on TV or movies . 	0
PE	13084	Children are not mature enough to make a judgment of what is good or bad , therefore they are likely to imitate the behaviors on TV out of their curiosity . 	0
PE	13085	Moreover , sometimes programs on TV are full of violence and sex which are harmful to children . 	0
PE	13086	I , therefore , did extremely bad at school due to the lack of studying . 	0
PE	13087	I could memorize all channels that TV programs was playing , but I could barely memorize any word on the textbook . 	0
PE	13088	As can be seen , these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world , making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages . 	0
PE	13089	Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper , nowadays , they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet , everywhere and at anytime . 	0
PE	13090	First of all , to obtain information , using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers . 	0
PE	13091	Personally , I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons . 	0
PE	13092	Some people , however , still believe that they can exist for long time ; others disagree , arguing that newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence . 	1
PE	13093	As a result of this , print media such as newspapers have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of readers . 	0
PE	13094	The internet has been more and more popular for recent years , providing people with a huge source of information . 	0
PE	13095	Will newspapers become a thing of the past ? 	0
PE	13096	Another point is that , from the economic aspect , buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one . 	0
PE	13097	Hence , the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information . 	1
PE	13098	Actually what is the best way to learn responsibility ? 	0
PE	13099	Hence , people will have more ways to go to a place . 	0
PE	13100	Since now buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community , It makes people in this area have no choice . 	0
PE	13101	However , it is difficult to find a community which can perfectly meet our requirements . 	0
PE	13102	In my hometown , there are almost complete public utilities for one ’ s needs but transportation . 	0
PE	13103	One important thing that I want to change about my hometown 	0
PE	13104	Public utilities and surroundings are the primary factors which we basically consider before we decide to live in a place . 	0
PE	13105	And this problem seem to get worst . 	0
PE	13106	At first , it should have more alternatives to use public transportation , such as a subway train or a sky train . 	1
PE	13107	So the thing that I really want to change is to have more public transportation . 	1
PE	13108	Since I ’ m facing the traffic congestion every day . 	1
PE	13109	First time I spend the whole money to eat at school and my money finished . 	0
PE	13110	I asked my father for extra money , but he refuse to give it to me . 	0
PE	13111	The high technology and new ideas applied into practice may not only lead a country to flourish but also elevate its status in the international community . 	0
PE	13112	Some may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention , but this argument is invalid . 	0
PE	13113	As a result you might make mistakes , you would not have done with more patience . 	1
PE	13114	To illustrate , I once wrote an essay in a hurry and got a bad grade , because I made few mistakes I could have avoided . 	0
PE	13115	When you are faced with difficult tasks and you do them in a rush , you are more likely to do avoidable errors or mistakes . 	0
PE	13116	Doing tasks in a hurry may end up in not considering all necessary aspects or opportunities . 	0
PE	13117	For example , a friend of mine lives at a slow pace and is really satisfied about it , because he can enjoy his family and cultivate his friendships . 	0
PE	13118	That ' s not enough , for higher education , which represent the cutting edge of a country ' s academic achievements , act as the vanguard in economic and social advance . 	0
PE	13119	Government budget focus , young children or university ? 	0
PE	13120	" Education is the investment in our future " , as Senator Bernie Sanders once pointed out , education , which fosters a civilized society , plays a significant role in a country ' s long-lasting prosperity . 	0
PE	13121	In addition , living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness . 	1
PE	13122	As for the two integral components within the system , elementary and advanced education , there ' s no doubt that a government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both . 	1
PE	13123	However , other people believe that the existence of zoos is next to nothing . 	0
PE	13124	In my opinion , the zoo deserves maintenance and public respect for two specific reasons . 	1
PE	13125	Hence , I recommend that big sports events should be held more frequently in the future . 	0
PE	13126	For a long time , the zoo has been a second home to endangered animals . 	0
PE	13127	At a higher level , it is of university students ' benefits to do biological research based on practical statistics and live recordings , which otherwise would not be at hand . 	0
PE	13128	This means that the zoos conduce to the acquisition of knowledge at various levels . 	0
PE	13129	First of all , the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners . 	1
PE	13130	With zoos , pupils will have a chance of observing the habit and unique instinct of , for instance , a lion or a crocodile . 	0
PE	13131	People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags , banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President . 	0
PE	13132	The eager atmosphere lasted many next days . 	0
PE	13133	When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others , many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness . 	0
PE	13134	For instance , when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008 , a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets . 	0
PE	13135	Therefore , it can be said that sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen . 	1
PE	13136	In conclusion , international sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely . 	1
PE	13137	In fact , some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally . 	0
PE	13138	However , the hooligans only took a minority of people . 	0
PE	13139	I remembered how I was suffered in the first round when I was last person who touched the line . 	0
PE	13140	However , I did not give up , and believed that I would be better in the next round because I knew how to improve myself . 	0
PE	13141	I had been a loser for a thousand time before the first winning , and suffering from losing in each competition makes me stronger . 	0
PE	13142	Thirdly , at some point , we , as an average people , might feel that the responsibility to our goal is too heavy to carry on . 	0
PE	13143	I believe that the responsibility is worthy of carrying . 	1
PE	13144	When the distance is longer and harder to achieve , a runner who can go beyond his limit will proud of himself . 	0
PE	13145	He can feel the sweetness of triumph because he did not stop pursing his goal . 	0
PE	13146	For these reasons , I agree that one should not give up , as the true reward is to have the dignity . 	1
PE	13147	Anyone who wants to achieve the goal should acknowledge that his effort and experience from suffering helps him understand his true potential and increase his strength , and ultimately , it will prompt him to be ready for overcoming the greater challenge in his life . 	1
PE	13148	So that , government should invest to create more jobs . 	1
PE	13149	Consequently , quality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy . 	0
PE	13150	Therefore , in my opinion , I accede with notion that government should pay attention on basic needs of people first . 	1
PE	13151	Thus , these technologies mean nothing if people lack of prosperity . 	0
PE	13152	Although developing technologies to discover amazing thing in galaxy is interesting , there are many people in the world are in poverty or starvation . 	0
PE	13153	Governments should spend money on space exploration or for basic needs of people 	0
PE	13154	There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities . 	0
PE	13155	When people did not have money , They had to rob other people . 	0
PE	13156	Then , many people did not have money . 	0
PE	13157	First , as you can see that after great economic recession , many people in many countries were unemployed . 	0
PE	13158	In spite of this , the disadvantages of the promotion of a universal language cannot be denied . 	0
PE	13159	To be more specific , a single international language may , to some extent , erode the cultural identity of a nation . 	1
PE	13160	This is because people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language , eroding a sense of national belong . 	0
PE	13161	Recently , there has been a social concern in regards to whether mobile phones have a negative effect in our social communication . 	0
PE	13162	Mobile phone ; " Iron man " / " Weichat " - destroy social interactions ? 	0
PE	13163	However , as far as I am concerned , I strongly agree with the view that this great invention causes many social problems . 	1
PE	13164	Indeed , mobile phones have been widely used for people of all ages , bringing convenience and entertainment into our life . 	0
PE	13165	In the first place , as people increasingly tend to focus and relay on phones , they may lose their interest on daily activities like meeting with their friends so that distraction may be developed during study or social activities . 	0
PE	13166	In the first place , spending too much time on phones may exert adverse effects on social life . 	1
PE	13167	Furthermore , there are many types of games available in the phone and many of them are very aggressive in nature such as " Iron man " . 	0
PE	13168	Moreover , continuous use of mobile phone may damage both eyesight and physical posture of the children . 	0
PE	13169	For instance , many games involve children helping their character to kill or shoot , which many lead to increased aggressive feelings , thoughts and behaviours . 	0
PE	13170	In those games , children are rewarded for being more violent , and this violence is repeated again and again . 	0
PE	13171	It enriches people ' s knowledge with worldwide information . 	0
PE	13172	It also positively affects the way people live in many other aspects . 	0
PE	13173	This is particularly essential when the globalization process has been permeating into all areas of society . 	0
PE	13174	Indeed , the fast growth of news media is helpful for people worldwide . 	0
PE	13175	In conclusion , the development of news media has been making great inroads into the lives of all people . 	1
PE	13176	It relaxes people with plentiful entertainment news . 	0
PE	13177	Obviously , the popularity of news media is beneficial to human beings . 	1
PE	13178	In addition to this , news media help people broaden their knowledge . 	1
PE	13179	It is clearly seen that mass media provide people with a variety of global news on all fields , including political situation , economic change , global warming , and so forth . 	0
PE	13180	Hence , there is a strong likelihood that today people are able to know the world better . 	0
PE	13181	For example , if an engineer needs to make a project , but he needs to deliver it tomorrow , he could save hours preparing a food with the microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch . 	0
PE	13182	Secondly , when someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason , some time ago he / she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food , but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food . 	1
PE	13183	Some good reasons are about having more time and being able to prepare better food without being a good cook . 	0
PE	13184	Firstly , people normally have lots of things to do . 	0
PE	13185	Because of that , they don ’ t have much time to spend in the kitchen . 	0
PE	13186	But being able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome . 	1
PE	13187	Easy preparation of food leads to a better life 	0
PE	13188	The Technology has developed a lot . 	0
PE	13189	With that development , food can be prepared more easily and it can taste a lot better than it used to . 	0
PE	13190	With that change , people ’ s lives are a lot better for several reasons . 	0
PE	13191	Furthermore , the preservation of old buildings is also a ways to conserve our culture and everyone can learn much from them . 	0
PE	13192	Old buildings should be used as the culture museums and provide accommodation with more convenient for people who live there . 	1
PE	13193	. 	0
PE	13194	Many cities have development strategies as a city contains both unique and modern beauty , and that preservation help to finish half of work . 	1
PE	13195	Overall , both of those view have strong arguments : the need for housing or the expense of restoration contrast with our desire to conserve culture and attract tourism . 	0
PE	13196	So I think we should restore those building because old buildings process the most outstanding feature of areas which contain them . 	1
PE	13197	Other than that , they have other critical obligations to take , in order to make our society function in an ordered way . 	1
PE	13198	In conclusion , it is a significant obligation of citizens to pay tax to the government . 	0
PE	13199	So it is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities , by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department . 	0
PE	13200	There are criminals in every society , and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited . 	0
PE	13201	Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force . 	0
PE	13202	In such case , aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial , which are a great complement to government support . 	0
PE	13203	It is true that the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties , but such financial help is usually far from enough . 	0
PE	13204	Leisure activities are one of them and I myself choose outdoor activities to spend my leisure time . 	1
PE	13205	There ' s no doubt that indoor activities like reading a book , watching TV or listening to music can bring us lots of joy . 	0
PE	13206	Admittedly , indoor activities are fun . 	1
PE	13207	After all , people are people and we have our own propensity . 	0
PE	13208	Although I can also have fun in indoor activities , this advantage cannot outweigh the attractions coming from outdoor activities . 	1
PE	13209	Moreover , you can also enjoy the beautiful nature when doing some outdoor activities like going hiking , sunbathing , going biking . 	1
PE	13210	If , for example , I hadn ' t participate in that camping , I wouldn ' t have had many friends like today . 	0
PE	13211	Spending time outdoors , people can breathe fresh air , feel the warm sun on their face and enjoy the complete peace that only nature brings . 	1
PE	13212	If you spend your spare time at home or something like that , you can ' t enjoy beautiful nature . 	0
PE	13213	Second , not all of serious movies are boring . 	0
PE	13214	" Click " is a very interesting comedy , with a serious approach about the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses . 	0
PE	13215	Serious or entertaining movies 	0
PE	13216	I prefer the serious movies which are simple , touching and powerful . 	1
PE	13217	Here are my reasons . 	0
PE	13218	First , most serious movies have a wide variety of content . 	1
PE	13219	Entertaining movies are created to amuse people . 	0
PE	13220	However , most entertaining movies are empty and nonsensical . 	0
PE	13221	Compared with the entertainment film , the serious film may be more worthwhile and meaningful . 	0
PE	13222	Serious movies usually designed to express one or more thinking about love , humaneness ; moreover , it may point out the dark sides of the society . 	0
PE	13223	Therefore , judging a person by his income is difficult , especially in the success aspect . 	1
PE	13224	On the other hand , the fact of knowing a man ' s utilization of his money remains in the dark . 	0
PE	13225	Yet , it is the common scene that a man can be publicly considered successful when his achievements , which can only accomplished by passion , dedication and ethics , are helpful not only for himself . 	0
PE	13226	In conclusion , using only money as a scale to measure a man ' s success is impossible despite the fact that it is the essential in basic needs . 	1
PE	13227	To conclude , I strongly believe that universities must open choice for everyone to select his subject . 	1
PE	13228	" Save the planet Earth " is a common line which can be read and heard all over the world . 	0
PE	13229	More , even if family members who are in different countries , they also can use the Internet to connect each others , especially though the images or videos , they can feel close . 	0
PE	13230	Instead of using letters , technology advanced not only gives us more spare time but also convenient and efficient . 	0
PE	13231	While public use the Internet or smart phone to share information to each other at different positions . 	0
PE	13232	The main advantage is that technology has enabled people stay in contact with each other more closely . 	1
PE	13233	However , I strongly agree with that the technology has large positive effects on relationships between people . 	1
PE	13234	As technology develops , it has negative influences in many respects . 	0
PE	13235	Nowadays , the variety of communication systems used widely . 	0
PE	13236	Man to man interaction changed 	0
PE	13237	Another issue is that in the ever-accelerated updating of science and technology , technology provides opportunities for people to establish the social network . 	0
PE	13238	Furthermore , technology is also essential for students , live in remote districts , shared the valuable natural resources with friends . 	0
PE	13239	Despite the argument of some people that learners can obtain more useful knowledge from teachers than from other sources , I firmly believe that both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children ' s acquisition of knowledge . 	1
PE	13240	It is undeniable that the widespread of alternative sources of knowledge has played an important role in students ' acquisition of knowledge . 	0
PE	13241	Teachers lesson vs other sources 	0
PE	13242	The way in which children today study is radically different from any previous generations , and the increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology has been instrumental in this change . 	0
PE	13243	Moreover , when students have some academic problems , they can post those to some websites and receive correct answers from unknown people in faraway places without any costs . 	0
PE	13244	Arts and public services are both important to the community and should be invested properly 	0
PE	13245	Computers can be programmed to provide an endless numbers of questions in diverse range of fields , and as the students answer these questions , the facts has been learned and reinforced . 	0
PE	13246	A case in point is the reading and listening parts of TOEFL iBT exams , as candidates have to answer many questions in a limited period of time . 	0
PE	13247	Thus , technologies are vital in students ' learning . 	1
PE	13248	There has been wide opinion that Government should invest more money on public services rather than arts such as music and theatre . 	0
PE	13249	On the other hand , if professors are busy in doing research , ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students , it would ruin the reputation of universities . 	0
PE	13250	Students are unsatisfied with the unprepared course , and the enrollment of universities may decline . 	0
PE	13251	Many students would not choose these kinds of universities to study . 	0
PE	13252	In this way , hardly can professors find assistants to help with projects . 	0
PE	13253	It is adverse to the whole academic field . 	0
PE	13254	Accordingly , spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors , rather than research . 	1
PE	13255	On the other hand , some people oppose the argument , saying it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society , since a great number of people , in fact , have had the capacity to pay for the both privately . 	1
PE	13256	Therefore , the government should be accountable for citizens ' health care and education to keep society safe and stable . 	1
PE	13257	Through to use the equipment and invent their own work , they may get more experience in the process of research . 	0
PE	13258	For instance , electronic students always invent new machines such as robots , MP3 and remote control car . 	0
PE	13259	If citizens had no access to health care and education , their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk . 	0
PE	13260	This is because citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment , which should be enabled by the government , the leader of the society . 	0
PE	13261	Some people argue that it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens . 	0
PE	13262	And a much debated issue these days is whether or not the government should be responsible for citizens ' health care and education . 	0
PE	13263	Despite the development of modern society , the health care and education still remain the basic rights of citizens . 	0
PE	13264	Government should be responsible for education and health care or not ? 	0
PE	13265	Personally speaking , it is unfair for passive smokers because they do not smoke but they have same health risks as the active one . 	1
PE	13266	Stroke , heart disorders , hearing loss , and cancers are some diseases that can attack passive smokers . 	0
PE	13267	When they are around the active smokers , they will inhale hazardous smoke . 	0
PE	13268	Last but not least , passive smokers will have a lot of health risks . 	0
PE	13269	The most dangerous people that would be affected by smoke are the pregnant women because they will breathe in the contaminated air and it will disrupt the growth of the babies . 	0
PE	13270	Smoking in restaurants also can affect the elders ' health , especially if they have problems with their hearts and lungs . 	1
PE	13271	Children have a high potential to imitate what adults do because they have really high curiosity towards something . 	0
PE	13272	Smoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children . 	1
PE	13273	State laws that prohibit it should be upheld so the restaurant ' management can make a clear rule in their restaurants because everyone has a right to enjoy their meals . 	0
PE	13274	In conclusion , smoking should not be permitted in restaurants because there will be a lot of people get disadvantaged . 	1
PE	13275	Educational rights must be given to both genders . 	0
PE	13276	Choice of course should be the discretion of the student and their merit , irrespective of the gender . 	0
PE	13277	Another reason is that from part time jobs students can earn money , which can help their parents . 	1
PE	13278	This experience taught me , doing part time job can help students to learn many things . 	0
PE	13279	I taught math to two kids of my neighbor . 	0
PE	13280	For instance , when i was in high school I worked as a home tutor . 	0
PE	13281	Moreover , I learn money management . 	0
PE	13282	This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively . 	0
PE	13283	From this i learned , how to manage money correctly . 	0
PE	13284	When my boss was out of the shop , i had to manage the accounts section of the shop . 	0
PE	13285	By tutoring them , i earned some money and bought me books with it . 	0
PE	13286	I helped them to understand the difficult topics of the books . 	0
PE	13287	A recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign , the sales revenue would increase by 40% , which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic . 	0
PE	13288	That is not to say , however , that advertisements have no downsides . 	0
PE	13289	First , it is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring . 	1
PE	13290	In fact , they are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture , good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor . 	0
PE	13291	Besides , it is obvious that publicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies . 	1
PE	13292	In a larger sense , it could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country . 	0
PE	13293	Should all the advertisements be banned ? 	0
PE	13294	Never in history was advertising industry so developed as in modern society and it has led to some adverse sentiments in public because some deliver exaggerated and fake information . 	0
PE	13295	Hence whether we should ban all the advertisements or not has aroused much controversy of the public . 	0
PE	13296	My view is that while some of them are disturbing , we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring . 	1
PE	13297	Secondly , most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns , especially in some countries where guns are available for people . 	1
PE	13298	So the fewer guns possessed , the fewer accidents would happened , our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates . 	1
PE	13299	Therefore , this is still a controversial topic around the world . 	0
PE	13300	However , gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others . 	0
PE	13301	Gun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society , which is strictly controlled in most countries . 	0
PE	13302	Gun control 	0
PE	13303	For example , we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting . 	0
PE	13304	The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns . 	0
PE	13305	The first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns . 	0
PE	13306	From my point of view , it is sensible to enforce the gun control . 	1
PE	13307	Undoubtedly , math , language , science and history are all extremely important subjects in student ' s education since these subjects provide students the basic understanding of the world . 	0
PE	13308	Younger school children should study art and music 	0
PE	13309	Nevertheless , the art and music , from my point of view , are also essential for younger student ' s future life because those subjects help students learn this planet from another perspective and they can release people from the enormous pressure nowadays . 	1
PE	13310	Therefore , some people assert that there is no need to learn other subjects for younger students . 	0
PE	13311	First of all , art and music would broaden student ' s horizon and therefore make them thoughtful . 	1
PE	13312	In this case , I would definitely agree that the art and music should be required to study . 	1
PE	13313	Under this circumstance , learning art and music enables students to appreciate the fruits of eminent artists and musicians and to feel the fascination of different cultures . 	0
PE	13314	It is well known that the art and music are not bound by country border , and they are something that is shared by the people from every parts of this world and is symbols of various cultures . 	0
PE	13315	For instance , students are able to feel the greatest music masterpiece in Euopren as the symphony of destiny-Beethoven ' s most notable workpiece is played . 	0
PE	13316	Ergo , opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime . 	0
PE	13317	However , one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences . 	0
PE	13318	In short , these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers . 	1
PE	13319	In the event of an argument , the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken . 	0
PE	13320	Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras . 	1
PE	13321	Looking from another perspective , the use of CCTV cameras does cause controversy . 	0
PE	13322	Furthermore , at some offices , employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers . 	0
PE	13323	Thus , it is clear that CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized . 	1
PE	13324	Hence , the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded . 	0
PE	13325	At times , face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger . 	0
PE	13326	In this complex society , we , young people , are encompassed with multiple tasks , so the ability to plan and organize is undoubtedly a powerful and sharp weapon that we must be armed with . 	1
PE	13327	It is obviously a huge waste of time . 	0
PE	13328	But if they make their plan in the first place , and then stick to their plans , they could get their work done quickly beyond their imagination . 	0
PE	13329	In the past , teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard , resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers . 	0
PE	13330	Second , technology also makes teaching simpler . 	1
PE	13331	Believe it or not , nowadays people are always confronted with a problem that whether technology makes their life simpler or not , thus making them confused . 	0
PE	13332	Technology makes people ' s lives simpler rather than complicated 	0
PE	13333	Although I conceded technology may make people ' s life complicated in some aspects , the convenience it brings is more . 	1
PE	13334	Many people advocate that technology makes their life easier . 	0
PE	13335	First , when it comes to the field of transportation , there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people ' s life simpler . 	1
PE	13336	In what follows , I will illustrate my point of view . 	0
PE	13337	Alternatively , if you would like to have a trip across the ocean , a plane can carry you there in only a few hours , which is hard to imagine in the ancient times . 	0
PE	13338	With a private car , you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle . 	0
PE	13339	While many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation , I strongly disagree with this notion . 	1
PE	13340	However , cars themselves , especially private ones , have exerted severe pressure on the environment and economy for wasteful oil consumption . 	0
PE	13341	There is no doubt our life has had a change for the better since cars were introduced . 	0
PE	13342	Increased taxation on petrol and diesel fuel to discourage private cars ? 	0
PE	13343	However , taxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation . 	0
PE	13344	Additionally , for those who have already afforded a car , there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities . 	0
PE	13345	Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains , buses or ferries . 	1
PE	13346	One can not deny the fact that if petrol and fuel taxation are raised , people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile . 	0
PE	13347	Consequently , people have to turn to cheaper alternatives , which might cause the abundance in goods and later on , economic crisis . 	1
PE	13348	To be precise , the more costly petrol is , the higher the price of necessary product : rice , meat or even vegetable . 	0
PE	13349	Todays life has some difficulty which become comfortable with the help of industry . 	0
PE	13350	Therefore , some lands should be assigned to industry . 	1
PE	13351	I would maintain that nowadays humans need farmland , housing and industry because of increasing population are more important than saving land for endangered animals . 	1
PE	13352	To conclude , the population of endangered animals are less than people ' s population , so they do not need so much land that people need . 	1
PE	13353	First , making college education free would cost too much . 	1
PE	13354	However , I believe that individuals should pay their college tuition because it would cost too much , the college education is a personal ' s choice , and there are many ways to fund a college education . 	1
PE	13355	Some people believe that the government should cover the college tuitions and expenses for any citizen who wants to go to a college . 	0
PE	13356	Should the Government Provide Free College ? 	0
PE	13357	Consequently , it would affect all taxpayers whether or not they benefit from the use of the funds . 	0
PE	13358	In addition , it would cause to raise our taxes again and again to fund college education . 	0
PE	13359	There are many other needs which should come first , such as providing health care to all American , or improving public schools . 	0
PE	13360	It would divert public funds from other needs such as law enforcement , infrastructure and so forth . 	0
PE	13361	Not everyone wants to go to a college . 	0
PE	13362	Second , it is a personal choice to go to a college . 	0
PE	13363	We should make full use of the past , instead of ignoring it , for a better and brighter future . 	0
PE	13364	How can the comtemporary scientists study the earth ' s gravity without the apple which fall on Newton ' s head . 	0
PE	13365	They are only some of many precious knowledge that the past presents us . 	0
PE	13366	We cannot ignore them in any way . 	0
PE	13367	All in all , the past ' s mistakes , success and knowledge all have crucial impact on people ' s lives today . 	1
PE	13368	For instance , Edison ' s statement " Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration " is still helpful for everyone today , and probably in the future . 	0
PE	13369	Last but not least , the past is the basis in which people can use to develope new knowledge , inventions . 	1
PE	13370	If it had not been for those knowledge in the past , we could never be as modern as today . 	0
PE	13371	How can America be the world ' s leading country if Columbus did not accidentally discover it in his search for India . 	0
PE	13372	Therefore , companies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation . 	1
PE	13373	To sum up , TV may take some of your time away from your family and friends but it can also make family get together and help to get in conversation . 	1
PE	13374	As well as it ' s one way of recent communications , based on that I think TV helps you to get connected with people . 	1
PE	13375	Moreover , TV can be connected to multimedia devices that have smart operating system like Google TV , WDTV using Skype , tango and other apps . 	0
PE	13376	In addition Teenagers can play games online with their friends ; therefore we can communicate with each other through TV . 	1
PE	13377	It was fun and a little bit similar to the cinema . 	0
PE	13378	Third , TV can be one of communication ways . 	0
PE	13379	However , if those with exaggerated and fake information could be banned , advertisements would be welcomed by more . 	0
PE	13380	Taken all together , advertisements have its social responsibility and contribute to economic growth . 	1
PE	13381	We can not deny all of them . 	0
PE	13382	Of course , the advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information , creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies . 	1
PE	13383	Yet , its merits still outweigh these downsides . 	0
PE	13384	It is targeted for children to teenager . 	0
PE	13385	For example , in Korea , there ' s program called EBS . 	0
PE	13386	However , I strongly believe that television has more positive effects than negative effects . 	1
PE	13387	Many people say that television has negative effects on children , since it can be violent or inappropriate for children . 	0
PE	13388	Nowadays , we have undergone many technology innovations such as Tv . 	0
PE	13389	Tv has NO negative effects on children 	0
PE	13390	If children can use those programs wisely , they can learn many information from it . 	0
PE	13391	Not only the up-to-date news , but also there are many programs which has educational purposes . 	0
PE	13392	First of all , television has useful and educational programs . 	1
PE	13393	There are two reasons to support my idea . 	0
PE	13394	In my opinion , one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons . 	1
PE	13395	While some students study and live overseas to achieve this , some prefer to study home because of the difficulties of living and studying overseas . 	0
PE	13396	As a result , the project cannot being done . 	0
PE	13397	In condition , doing all jobs alone makes employees fall asleep easily . 	0
PE	13398	The other reason is that great success requires taking great risks . 	1
PE	13399	There are always interesting and useful experiences that successful people can learn them only by trying new things . 	0
PE	13400	For example , if you want to know how to act effectively when communicating with people , you can try something new like salesmanship in various stores and places . 	0
PE	13401	By selling goods or other commodities you will face different people with different behaviors and personalities and as a result you will learn how to behave people in different situations and jobs in the future . 	0
PE	13402	Successful people try new things and take risks 	0
PE	13403	I have my own reasons why I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks . 	0
PE	13404	There are many viewpoints regarding what the main characteristics of successful people are . 	0
PE	13405	Fatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child ' s life starting from the the birth 	0
PE	13406	These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can ’ t be always found in books . 	1
PE	13407	I do believe that great success requires taking great risks . 	0
PE	13408	During my all vacations , I used to miss my school due to which I used to restart my session with great enthusiasm of learning and scoring good marks in new quarter . 	0
PE	13409	If I work for other people , I have to give my ideas to employers cheaply . 	0
PE	13410	Which is better - Learning foreign language in home or host country ? 	0
PE	13411	As a result , they lit the light for the poor and victims ; in addition , they could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world . 	0
PE	13412	For the above reasons and examples , it could be widely thought that groups or organizations are a vital part for us in plenty of aspects in different ages and in different backgrounds . 	1
PE	13413	Our World has varied cultures and each culture has its own language . 	0
PE	13414	Also , I think its better that people learn foreign language in their own country . 	1
PE	13415	The reasons for holding that opinion are illustrated in the subsequent paragraphs . 	0
PE	13416	First of all , it is not possible for everyone to visit a foreign country to learn a foreign language as it requires large amount of money and legal formalities . 	1
PE	13417	In the earlier periods , it was not easy to find a teacher to learn a foreign languge . 	0
PE	13418	But with the advent of globalization , one can easily find a teacher in their own country . 	1
PE	13419	After all , charity organisations are mainly funded by the home country thus there is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected . 	0
PE	13420	Despite the importance of helping those beyond our national borders , it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens . 	1
PE	13421	By solving the problems in the home country , it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth . 	0
PE	13422	Another reason is that , even within the most developed countries , there are still poor people who lack their basic needs . 	0
PE	13423	In conclusion , people from unfortunate countries need more international assistance while helping citizens in the home country is also necessary . 	1
PE	13424	But to me , learning about life through personal experience seems more appropriate . 	1
PE	13425	In summary , each way learning life has its own benefits . 	0
PE	13426	However , flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy . 	1
PE	13427	Holiday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions , but also pay for food , accommodation , transportation and entertainment . 	0
PE	13428	With this convenient and versatile facility , students can improve their learning condition . 	0
PE	13429	For instance , folks have to check their Facebooks , Twitters , and Forums accounts every minute , which add too much pressure to them . 	0
PE	13430	I favor the former ; that is , I prefer to spend money on improving facilities . 	1
PE	13431	I disagree with this view . 	0
PE	13432	For example , library is a good place for students to study or research . 	0
PE	13433	They can concentrate on the subjects with a tranquil ambience ; also , there are a lot of references for students to utilize . 	0
PE	13434	Tourism also creates more pollution and waste , including growing emission of greenhouse gases , dumped leftovers and overuse of water , power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels . 	0
PE	13435	There is a hotly debated issue over whether universities should spend money on improving facilities is more than hiring famous teachers , and this topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity . 	0
PE	13436	I admit that tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment . 	1
PE	13437	After deeply pondering over this issue , I develop my own perspective as well . 	0
PE	13438	It can influence us in different aspects of life . 	0
PE	13439	In conclusion , studying abroad does not only have advantages , but also can change us in a very positive way . 	1
PE	13440	Both genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior . 	0
PE	13441	It would affect students ' mental health to study in the environment of single gender . 	0
PE	13442	In conclusion , it is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls , and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject . 	1
PE	13443	For example , a girl , who is interested in literature , is arranged into an engineering department , but she is unlikely to focus on her subject , and this also can block the girl ' s future development and career prospect . 	0
PE	13444	People who cannot afford to pay their tuition benefit from the scholarship , financial aids , and other funds . 	0
PE	13445	Third , there are many ways to fund a college education . 	1
PE	13446	Therefore , those people should make the financial investment in their own choice ; not the government . 	1
PE	13447	People who want to make more money , and live a better life than other people decide to take a college education . 	0
PE	13448	While the money is not given to individual students , these contributions are not trivial . 	0
PE	13449	They also provide funds for academic research . 	0
PE	13450	They often provide services such as fire departments , medical assistance , and police protection for the schools and their students . 	0
PE	13451	In addition , the government already helps pay college expense through indirect means . 	0
PE	13452	Otherwise , it would cause too much cost from taxpayers and the government . 	1
PE	13453	In short , the individual should finance his or her education because it is a personal choice . 	1
PE	13454	Moreover , children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills , they will know little about the outside life . 	0
PE	13455	It is a well-known fact that people who are addicted to games , especially online games , can eventually bear dangerous consequences . 	1
PE	13456	First , using computer constantly has bad influence on children ' s eyes . 	1
PE	13457	When they concentrate on computer for too long , their eyes will get tired , which is the main reason for some eyes problems , typically shortsighted . 	0
PE	13458	Some people think that computer is good for children and it should be used daily by children but some others think differently . 	0
PE	13459	In my opinion , the latter opinion is true . 	0
PE	13460	Computer has negative effects to children 	0
PE	13461	Nowadays , thanks to the development of technology , computer is now indispensable to life . 	0
PE	13462	For instance , several teenagers play games without rest , which leads to health depression , a typical example is the death of Korean gamer , who had a non-stop playing for 3 days . 	0
PE	13463	Finally , even people who are not interested in online game can still be negatively affected by using computer too much . 	1
PE	13464	In conclusion , I totally disagree with this statement that teachers should be paid by how much their students learn because teacher could not pay attention to each students in class . 	1
PE	13465	Besides , learning abilities of student are different . 	1
PE	13466	In conclusion , the time-saving , simple food preparation process gives us more time to do other activities , more chance to select diverse kinds of foods and more willingness to cook meals . 	1
PE	13467	Of course , there may be some other perspectives that I neglected to fully consider . 	0
PE	13468	More men , on the other hand , are willing to participate in cooking that they had never done before . 	0
PE	13469	This transformation may bring positive impacts to family in some cases . 	1
PE	13470	Nevertheless , for the reasons that I have presented above , I would assert that this change has improved our life significantly . 	1
PE	13471	If people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying , they can stares in their workplace . 	0
PE	13472	For example , I have a friend who was working so slowly . 	0
PE	13473	I am totally agrees with the statement for some reasons . 	0
PE	13474	Trying to learn skills , working in two places in a week and gaining more tasks are the reasons which take into account as the most important causes of my choice . 	1
PE	13475	To begin with , if persons work rapidly , they will have more chance to study . 	1
PE	13476	Attending in some classes which try to increase the skills of employees can be considered as an absolutely effective parameter . 	0
PE	13477	More important to work quickly and risk making mistakes 	0
PE	13478	Organizations , these days , seek to find people who can work extraordinary fast and carefully . 	0
PE	13479	These people play an important role to increase effectiveness of a company . 	0
PE	13480	Working fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal mentioned before . 	1
PE	13481	The reasons are the followings . 	0
PE	13482	Capitalism enfranchised people ' s right to own properties , and consequently , their rights to use them . 	0
PE	13483	Driving cars during the rush hours might is bound to polluting cities ' s environment , but laws protect drivers to do so , and accordingly , charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction . 	1
PE	13484	From another point of view , traffic jam is a natural phenomenon that nobody is able to shun or ban ; so it is out of drivers ' control . 	0
PE	13485	Drivers have to pay a fee for driving in Rush Hour 	0
PE	13486	Started in the late eighteenth century , the industrialization and urbanization witnessed the explosion in number of automobiles . 	0
PE	13487	The very fuel that they rely on , oil , has now become the dominant pollution of cities ' environment . 	0
PE	13488	While critics castigating about the exorbitant use of oil and other insisting to charged drivers with extra fee during the rush hours for their selfish conducts , I hold the contention that no additional payment should be charged on them . 	1
PE	13489	Why drivers should pay a fine only for driving their own cars in a particular time ? 	0
PE	13490	Wars are notorious , but you can ' t blame the soldiers who are justing fight for their countries . 	0
PE	13491	Second , public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems . 	1
PE	13492	Averagely , public transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars . 	0
PE	13493	In the contrary , if the public transportation is efficiently used , the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower . 	0
PE	13494	And this definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource , gasoline . 	0
PE	13495	Cars depend on gasoline , which is a non-renewable resource . 	0
PE	13496	Therefore , the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up . 	0
PE	13497	In my opinion , governments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system because it would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating . 	1
PE	13498	First , the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation . 	1
PE	13499	Improve roads or public transports 	0
PE	13500	Many people think that governments should spend money on improving roads and highways while the others say that it would be better to spend money on public transportation . 	0
PE	13501	For instance , tourists are given the brochures about the local traditions and customs before they visit the place . 	0
PE	13502	On the other hand , in order to avoid the conflicts between foreigners and locals , people are trying to understand different culture and find solutions . 	1
PE	13503	I agree with both opinions that international tourism not only causes tension but also leads to understanding between people from different culture , because most people will be trying to understand each other after they have conflict or debates . 	1
PE	13504	International tourism leads to both - tension and understanding 	0
PE	13505	Firstly , some people leave the rubbish after visiting the attractions . 	0
PE	13506	There is no doubt that some behaviors of the tourists are not welcome in the local area . 	1
PE	13507	Moreover , tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background . 	0
PE	13508	Therefore , those local residents have to clean the place frequently so that the new batch of tourists will have a tidy and neat environment . 	0
PE	13509	Thus , if tourists want to respect the tradition , they will not order any beef in the local restaurant . 	0
PE	13510	For example , Indians don ' t eat beef since they worship cows . 	0
PE	13511	These two art forms not only provide the public with entertainment but also contribute significantly to the economy . 	0
PE	13512	The income of film and music industries produce millions of dollars each year for the Goverment , for instance K-pop and Hollywood , and these industries can not survive without goverment ' s financial assistance . 	0
PE	13513	But our standard of living also depend on another factor - spiritual life which is related closely with arts . 	1
PE	13514	Arts include many forms and music as well as cinema are the most typical . 	0
PE	13515	Investing in hospitals helps improve people ' s health , also , in schools assists with raising our children ' s education level . 	0
PE	13516	Apparently if these facilities were not spent adequately , our standard of living would deteriorate . 	0
PE	13517	However , in my perspective , both public services and arts worth investment . 	1
PE	13518	It is obvious axiomatic that indispensable public services like hospital and school worth every penny investing . 	1
PE	13519	As can be seen from this , is that a hurried decision is almost never a good one . 	1
PE	13520	That ' s why one should always study his decision carefully and slowly , to ensure that the decision that the person is making is the best for him . 	0
PE	13521	In this case , the child would imitate the actor ' s behaviors in order to look like to him . 	0
PE	13522	In addition , computers can do most difficult tasks which leads to make life easier . 	0
PE	13523	By considering all reasons , advantages of computers outweigh disadvantages . 	1
PE	13524	Moreover , even when people watch television together , there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television . 	1
PE	13525	Watching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone . 	0
PE	13526	Thus , it is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness . 	0
PE	13527	To illustrate my point , it is reported that most of people don ' t converse with their family when they are watching television together . 	0
PE	13528	It is natural they behave in that way because television shows don ' t require any participation . 	0
PE	13529	In conclusion , I firmly believe that it is detrimental to communication among members in group , family or friends or whatever , to sit in front of television and just stare forward . 	1
PE	13530	It is because television not only makes people be obsessed with it but also makes their mouth close . 	1
PE	13531	Thus , unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child ’ s behaviors . 	1
PE	13532	For example , in Indian sub-continent there are large number of centers opened for getting trained in variety of languages like french , german etc . Second , colleges and universities have introduced foreign language course as a part of their curriculum . 	0
PE	13533	Students can choose any language from the set of languages available at a university . 	0
PE	13534	But the benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points . 	0
PE	13535	All in all , the university should allow the student to participate in the classed without passing the test because not only is every students expert in every part of one subject but also it will reduce the student in the campus who leave uncultivated . 	1
PE	13536	In the end , this student will become a loser in the world . 	0
PE	13537	And all this is due to that the university don ' t permit them to attend the class . 	0
PE	13538	This is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system . 	0
PE	13539	Admittedly , the university student may don ' t reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not . 	1
PE	13540	They do not undergo any pain or misery . 	0
PE	13541	Why do not we have other wisely punishments ? 	0
PE	13542	As we can see some industries such as mining , oil and gas extraction , reclamation , etc , needs many labors . 	0
PE	13543	Why do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country - it is better . 	0
PE	13544	Moreover , rehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts . 	0
PE	13545	To conclude , capital punishment is a form of legalized revenge , it is an easy way for serious crimes , and nobody has rights to take others life ; thus , it neither demines crimes of violence nor be essential to control violence in society . 	1
PE	13546	The world should consider clearly about polishing the law of the dead penalty . 	1
PE	13547	For instance , my older brother has got married and lived independently for two years but when he faces difficulties in his work or his life , he comes back to meet our parents and ask for advice . 	0
PE	13548	To conclude , I strongly believe that parents are our best teachers . 	1
PE	13549	Also , being caged in the zoos for long render wildlife lost the ability to survive in nature where is full of cruel competition among various animals . 	0
PE	13550	In order to protect animals , from my perspective , zoos offer a good man-made environment which could prolong the life span of wild animals and cultivate the notion of protecting animals . 	1
PE	13551	What the zoos should do is improvement of the management system and use the income wisely in preserving wild animals better . 	0
PE	13552	When children pay a visit to the zoos , they still could observe the eating behavior or leisure activities among animals , which would definitely enrich their knowledge associated with different animals . 	0
PE	13553	Further , children could acquire the information regarding how to protect wild animals according to guided tour or volunteers . 	0
PE	13554	On the other hand , complained about the drawbacks of zoos are often heard . 	1
PE	13555	It is true that some zoos are lack of systematic management which attributes to numerous wild animals die because of food shortage . 	0
PE	13556	I think when we leave school , maybe we will forget parts of the lessons we learn at school if we do not experience them in life , but I strongly believe we will never forget what our parents have taught us because we use it every day . 	1
PE	13557	For example , I believe I will never forget what my parents told me about how to be grateful to other people who help me . 	0
PE	13558	The fact that a company is a large one , this means that it ' s having a considerable success . 	0
PE	13559	Second , I think that a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one . 	1
PE	13560	Thirdly , I totally believe parents love their sons or daughters unconditionally . 	0
PE	13561	Companies vary from small to large ones based on the context , success and needs of their work . 	0
PE	13562	Some people prefer to work for a large company 	0
PE	13563	I personally prefer to work for a large company for several reasons . 	1
PE	13564	Small companies usually have a local job in the area , while large companies work in an international context providing for the entire nation or even for other foreign countries . 	0
PE	13565	Large companies always look for new skilled employees to fill in their need of distributing , managing and selling their products in different countries . 	0
PE	13566	First , to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company . 	1
PE	13567	In other words , Large company equals more job opportunity . 	0
PE	13568	For example , if a large company decides to open a branch in a foreign country , they would need more employees in that country to work there . 	0

VG	14323	There are two real reason I started a couple of forums and they are both related to my former addiction to alcohol . 	0
VG	14324	The above is really some background first off . 	0

VG	14329	The first was to find something to do with an aweful lot of spare time and to make some money ( cant live on freah air ) and so the original Parkweb Oracle site was launched and although it wasnt the kind of money I was used to it is enough to comfortable survive . 	1
VG	14330	But like I said 2 reasons . 	0
VG	14331	I wanted to give a little back to all of the people that helped me and stood by me through my addiction - I made a promise to them all when I was back on my feet so to speak I would do something to try and make a difference . 	0

VG	14333	The atmosphere is different , or , at least , might be different C . Perelman , L . Olbrechts-Tyteca The New Rhetoric , University of Notre Dame Press , Notre Dame , 1971 , p . 285 	0
VG	14334	Hence it can be maintained that the nationalization of a concern , or even of a whole industrial branch , is not a socialistic measure since the rest of the economy continues to be based on the principle of private initiative and of the market economy since the nationalized branch is itself subject to the discipline of the market , particularly by paying its way by means of sales rather than by means of subsidies from the state . 	1
VG	14335	The only point we want to stress is that , between a socialized economy and one certain branches of which have been nationalized , there is more than a quantitative difference . 	0

VG	14339	Strategy reorganised itself around a balance of terror , Mutually Assured Destruction . 	0

VG	14341	Hiroshima was the start of a process leading to the development of weaponry that made territorial struggles irrelevant . 	0
VG	14342	The long-distance delivery of weapons of mass destruction altered the character of war itself . 	0
VG	14343	The fact that the war was finally won in the East by tactics that had nothing to do with this ( the atomic bomb ) doesn ' t alter the circumstances in which the war began . 	0
VG	14344	It might , though , make us think about why things since 1945 have been so different . 	0
VG	14345	On the first aspect : the conflict that we undertook ( rightly , I believe ) in 1939 belonged to a world in which wars were still fought between clearly defined sovereign states struggling over the control of territory . 	0
VG	14346	Both sides could ( and did ) inflict the tactics of terror on the other by aerial bombardment ; but whether in France or Russia or the Western Desert , the heart of the conflict was about promoting or resisting territorial advance . 	0

WD	15833	In addition he adds that single-sex education for boys would allow adequate time for male maturation and would benefit the boys by giving them more structure and discipline due to their tendencies of restlessness and aggression ( Mael , 1998 ) It seems clear that single-sex education advocates have done their research and that it does make sense that girls and boys being separated would foster an environment of non-stereotyping and encourage learning . 	0
WD	15834	Thus my lack of surprise to learn that public school students outperform private school students on a level playing field and that public schools and their teachers are more open to innovations and trying new learning techniques . 	0

WD	15880	But , from 2007-2010 , JHS was unable to “ initiate this program as designed ” and now plans to revamp the program . 	0
WD	15881	There is no need to politicize the classroom any more than it already has been . 	0
WD	15882	So , I guess by the author ' s reasoning , we ' re ALL " good " people . 	0
WD	15883	Good parents do what is best for their children , and they already support public schools with their tax dollars whether or not their children attend . 	0
WD	15884	It went great as far as academics and learning . 	0
WD	15885	I was sent to private schools my first 7 of years of schooling . 	0
WD	15886	It wasn ' t that I was stupid or that my parents wouldn ' t help , it was that I was bored to tears and had teachers who , even obvious to a 7th grader , HATED their jobs . 	0
WD	15887	Then , I was switched to public schooling in a " better " district , and my grades went from A ' s to D ' s . 	0
WD	15888	I know it sounds wrong , but that ' s the way it is . . . 	0
WD	15889	5 ) Religion is a touchy issue . 	0
WD	15890	A 2010 study on two separate pre-school classes displays negative , social affects on students , " In one class , the teacher used gender-specific language to address the children . 	0
WD	15891	The other teacher did not . 	0
WD	15892	It is clear to me that the issue of single-sex education juggles an academic as well as a psychological / social side . 	0
WD	15893	A article published by ABC News focuses on the negative effects of single-sex education when it comes to the social aspect . 	0
WD	15894	But does that single-sex environment only further the intelligence of the " elite " students in private education ? 	0
WD	15895	Again , Penn State ' s Lynn Liben denies any benefits of single-sex schooling , " Kids ' own occupational aspirations are going to be limited , and there could be long-term consequences where , for example , girls are used to being in roles only among other girls , then they have to face the real world where that ' s not the case . " 	0
WD	15896	Another factor in this issue is that most single-sex schools are private , and require an entrance test . 	0
WD	15897	Therefore , one can argue that the students in single-sex schools are already at an advantage . 	0
WD	15898	Studies show that women suffer from a stereotype threat in math and science , meaning that in the fields of math and science women are more apprehensive to perform due to their perceived inferiority to men . 	0
WD	15899	Perhaps that is why girls at my high school were so confident in their work , there were no boys to do better and perhaps this is why women are always found to do better in single-sex school environments . 	0
WD	15900	Even Jesus was against school prayer . 	0
WD	15901	Matt 6 : 5-6 Anyways , children can pray in school if they want to . 	0
WD	15902	Japan , where no one prays at school , has the lowest crime rate of any developed nation . 	0
WD	15903	I mean , c ’ mon ! 	0
WD	15904	How pathetic . 	0
WD	15905	Are we so weak minded ? 	0
WD	15906	Wow , here we go again . 	0
WD	15907	Christians blaming moral decline on prayer being taken out of school . 	0
WD	15908	At the end of the day , we are not preparing our students for the real world . 	0
WD	15909	That right hasn ’ t been taken away , they merely need to keep it to themselves . 	0
WD	15910	It just isn ’ t fair to have prayer required in schools . 	1
WD	15911	Many schools are choosing to spend those limited resources on single-sex programs despite the fact that “ there is no well-designed research showing that single-sex education improves students ’ academic performance , but there is evidence that sex segregation increases gender stereotyping and legitimizes institutional sexism . ” 	0
WD	15912	The Socialist agenda of world domination makes no place for solemn “ swearing ” between individuals . 	0
WD	15913	As a result of prioritizing single-sex classes , these schools don ’ t have the funds to spend on techniques that have actually been proven to improve academic outcomes , like smaller class sizes and personalized learning environments with mentors , counseling , and other supports . 	0
WD	15914	Private schools usually offer smaller classrooms , and generally provide better facilities for students . 	0
WD	15915	What ’ s next ? 	0
WD	15916	Today , parents and students can choose a variety of ways to homeschool . 	0
WD	15917	There are co-ops that offer classes to all levels from pre-k to high school . 	0
WD	15918	Some offer these classes throughout the week and you can choose which classes to take . 	0
WD	15919	Others offer classes once a week and parents teach . 	0
WD	15920	In fact , I didn ' t really grasp geometry till I started gardening . 	0
WD	15921	Today ' s homeschoolers can learn Russian or even geometry without their parent ' s assistance through DVDs and online courses . 	0
WD	15922	Homeschool has morphed into a uniquely American creation . 	0
WD	15923	We should all be proud of what it has become no matter where we stand on the homeschool versus public school debate . 	0
WD	15924	Then there is the mix of private school and homeschool , where the student is taught in a classroom three days a week and the parent downloads assignments from the same teacher the other two days a week . 	0
WD	15925	You can participate in any sport or any extracurricular function via these co-ops that you can in public school . 	0
WD	15926	I think mainstream is not that much good for our kids . 	1
WD	15927	There must be some changes for getting out their best from them . 	0
WD	15928	I ' m a regular education teacher . 	0
WD	15929	I have students mainstreamed into my class every year . 	0
WD	15930	My opinion is that it needs to be done far more judiciously than it is done now- if six exceptional children are put in my class , that is the equivalent of putting an entire special ed classroom into my regular class . 	0
WD	15931	I personally feel like these kids are shortchanged- some of them are good kids who need an adult close by and able to give more focused attention . 	0
WD	15932	In a class of 30+ , this isn ' t going to happen consistently . 	0
WD	15933	And some of the ones who come to me have legally imposed modifications , some of which have little or no bearing on what I teach , so I am not allowed to handle my class in a way I think it should be done . 	0
WD	15934	That impairs my efficiency as an educator . 	0
WD	15935	Also , some have so many modifications that for all intents and purposes they are merely taking a special ed class whose physical location just happens to be in a regular classroom . 	0
WD	15936	From my point of view , mainstreaming is not a terrible idea , but it is lamentable in its execution , and because of that , damaging in its results . 	1
WD	15937	Dr . Densmore encourages parents to keep themselves on an even keel and project a steady , positive attitude . 	0
WD	15938	Lib mentality on crack ! 	0
WD	15939	Extreme behavioral trouble , kids that just aren ' t able to keep up with what they ' re learning in average classes , etc . But on the whole , I like mainstreaming . 	1
WD	15940	Besides forbidding perjury , ( calling God to witness a lie ) and false swearing , this passage also forbids all rash and unnecessary swearing , and especially warns against promissory oaths – that require a performance . 	0
WD	15941	Public schools receive money from federal and state governments and are obligated to do whatever the state and national governments say . 	0
WD	15942	I have 2 kids born 3 years 2 days apart . 	0
WD	15943	It is a juggling act for teachers in inclusive classrooms to handle the needs of so many different students but it is well worth the reward . 	1
WD	15944	He also notes in the article the classroom ' s reaction to Jonas ' demeanor ( slow to articulate his words , delay in making his meaning understanding ) and how there is a clearly defined moment where the classroom establishes that Jonas is " different " . 	0
WD	15945	The professor realizes in that instance that this is a moment for himself and the classroom to accept and engage Jonas and somehow help him navigate his way throughout the course and the classroom . 	0
WD	15946	Forced prayer isn ’ t prayer anyway . 	0
WD	15947	When prayer was removed from the schools I think that it worked to the Christians advantage , not against them . 	0
WD	15948	I have a feeling that all we Christians are asking for when they want prayer back into the schools is for some sort of superior respect above all other religions in allowing us to have our sacred prayers brought into the schools . 	0
WD	15949	How many of us would stand for that kind of equality ? 	0
WD	15950	Jesus said to expect persecution , suffering , being servants of all and to be in the face of regular culture standards . 	0
WD	15951	Why would Christians demand or even expect that their way of doing things should be allowed and even made a routine ? 	0
WD	15952	It makes no sense to expect a public school to act in a Christian manner . 	0
WD	15953	He did not say to get upset when the government goes the opposite way of what is comfortable to us and try to make our systems fit our religious needs the best . 	0
WD	15954	If prayer being in the schools or not seriously affects the outcome of our students , or affects anything at all in the Christian world negatively than I think we have a lot more serious problems to think about than whether or not the kids are allowed to pray or not in school . 	0
WD	15955	It makes no sense to expect a public school to bring prayer back , if that ’ s what we want , we should send our kids to a Christian school . 	0
WD	15956	We not only have a strong parental relationship but the siblings do as well . 	0
WD	15957	This alone is a wonderful opportunity for building social skills . 	0
WD	15958	The usual argument for private schools is that they have the freedom to offer any curriculum that they choose , and the freedom to hire or fire teachers who can teach effectively . 	0
WD	15959	He notes that student bodies are increasingly riddled with drugs , violence , promiscuity , emotional disorders , crime , illiteracy , peer dependency and contempt for authority . 	0
WD	15960	It is disturbing to read the 101 reasons to homeschool . 	0
WD	15961	How is that for socialization ? 	0
WD	15962	One reason we choose to homeschool is because our family wanted to maintain family relationships in a way that cannot be done if our children are in school six-plus hours a day . 	0
WD	15963	Life is short and we want to spend the majority of our time together . 	0
WD	15964	Children grow up quickly and before you know it , they are heading off on their own . 	0
WD	15965	Of course this is not the only reason to homeschool but since we are interacting with each other all day long , it forces us to deal with relationship issues when they come up . 	0
WD	15966	We enjoy being around our children and they enjoy being around us . 	0
WD	15967	There is no longer an absolute and just legal basis for judging “ between a man and his brother , ” much less a man and his neighbor ( Deuteronomy 1 : 16 , 17 ) . 	0
WD	15968	Fortunately , my parents saw what was happening and moved me to a private school where I was challenged at or above the grade level I was in at the time . 	0
WD	15969	( I am certainly not the first to ask this question . ) 	0
WD	15970	Leonard Sax , a psychologist and physician , argues not only that gender segregated schools can be equal , but that they can be better than coeducational schooling . 	1
WD	15971	The Supreme Court ruled that separate but equal in regard to race is not actually equal at all . 	0
WD	15972	Should we expect gendered segregation of schooling to be any different ? 	0
WD	15973	According to the ACLU , not only are sex-segregated educational programs ineffective , they are illegal . 	1
WD	15974	Title IX , which states that “ No person in the United States shall , on the basis of sex , be excluded from participation in , be denied the benefits of , or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance … ” , is where the ACLU and other opponents of sex-segregated schools point to bolster their claim of illegality . 	0
WD	15975	He argues that the language of “ separate but equal ” in relation to the single-sex education debate is out of place because while racial segregation of schooling was about limiting students ’ access , single-sex education is about broadening students ’ access and opportunities . 	0
WD	15976	The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) disagrees . 	0
WD	15977	The ACLU has struggled against sex-segregated schooling for a very long time , but earlier this year they officially launched their “ Teach Kids , Not Stereotypes ” campaign . 	0
WD	15978	As a part of the campaign , they gathered data on single-sex education programs in 15 states and found that the majority of them were out of compliance with Title IX requirements . 	0

WD	15986	All affairs of life become subject to state , rather than individual control . 	0
WD	15987	That is the only thing that kept me from being a delinquent . 	0
WD	15988	I would argue that integration is an aspiration and not a prerequisite for ensuring the best education for disabled children . 	0
WD	15989	This has the effect of treating all students the same and teaching them the same things , despite the fact that every student is unique , and not all students fit into the same categories . 	0
WD	15990	Just look at the students of the Kings School you see traveling to school I went to the Lorien novalis school fete at dural on Saturday amazed at the Muslim mothers there but then I thought this school gives them the chance to partipate in their children ' s education far more than the local state school so as a community private education is far better around than state education can be 	1
WD	15991	Worse yet even the most successful ones while good at rote items were quite helpless and pathetic when it came to independent or critical thinking . 	0
WD	15992	A number of conservative Christian leaders frequently complain about the tragic injustice of how kids aren ’ t allowed to pray in school anymore . 	0
WD	15993	You can customize the syllabus for your child according to his needs and abilities . 	0
WD	15994	There is a lot of heated rhetoric in the air these days regarding an alleged ban on prayer in the public schools . 	0
WD	15995	Admittedly 71 per cent of respondents at the 2001 census described themselves as " Christian " , but if most of those are not religious and don ' t believe in God , that ' s a pretty nominal affiliation . 	0
WD	15996	My reading of it is now lots of grandparents are awarding scholarships to their grandchildren and a good private school allows the grandparents access to the children ' s education by the out of hours activities that these schools offer against the public system . . 	0

WD	16001	If a private school is not teaching its students well enough , its graduation rate , or its college acceptance rate , will sink , and parents will be able to quickly remove their child and put him or her into a better school . 	0

WD	16030	Give me a break ! 	0
WD	16031	It would require that they make certain that their children are given opportunities to interact with and form lasting relationships with other children in their age group , and this is can achieved by exposing them to extracurricular activities . 	0
WD	16032	I sent my kid to private school so that she could get a better education . 	0

WD	16034	She was at a public school that was 90% hispanic . 	0
WD	16035	The problem was not their race but the fact that they were way behind in reading langauge and math . 	0

WD	16043	In fact I had one teacher tell me she didn ' t assign homework because the kids didn ' t do it anyway . . . WHAT ? 	0
WD	16044	They can ' t bring home their books , so they rarely have homework to reinforce what they ' ve learned in school . 	0

WD	16046	So reward the bad behavior ? ? 	0
WD	16047	If understood , our word uttered in integrity should of itself be a sufficient and proper bond . 	0
WD	16048	It is , and always has been pure ignorance , stop slating something you have no experience or knowledge about . 	0
WD	16049	If it is a public school it should be a place where all cultures and all religions and all people should be able to come and feel comfortable in order to do what they are there to do which I ’ m sorry is not to learn about religion . 	0
WD	16050	If you want prayer forced send your child to a religious specific school . 	0
WD	16051	Yet you walk down the street or listen to the 18-24ish yr olds today and they are complaining about having to work more than 6 hours at a decently paying job . 	0
WD	16052	I remember my Grandfather telling stories of the horrible things that he was forced to do in WWII things that no one should ever have to go through , NO ONE ( at 19 mind you ) . 	0
WD	16053	In conclusion , I personally believe that forcing prayer upon our children in the class room is wrong . 	1
WD	16054	Ok if anyone has actually read this entire thing I thank you for your time and I apologize if I have jumped around a lot . 	0
WD	16055	I know that more than half of you remember when you were young if you didn ’ t do what your father told you , you were going to get the belt , and you know what you sure never made that mistake again . 	0
WD	16056	In today ’ s society it has become acceptable to avoid all sense of responsibility . 	0
WD	16057	People today are basically in my mind , for a lack of a better word soft . 	0
WD	16058	Now , you even show your child a belt with the intention of hitting him / her and your own child can sue you . 	0
WD	16059	This was different . 	0
WD	16060	This was saying we believe in coeducation , because we live in a coed world , but in this one particular area we ’ re giving up . 	0
WD	16061	Those schools weren ’ t founded on the premise that men and women have incompatible intellects , but in recognition of what were often limited educational opportunities for women . 	0
WD	16062	Their origin stories belonged to the past , and their traditions continued , Hogwarts-like , under their own steam . 	0
WD	16063	Everything I could think of saying sounded offensive or deflating or dumb : math is hard for girls ; they—that is , you—need special treatment ; boys ’ and girls ’ brains are different ; pre-algebra with boys in the room is just too exciting—you won ’ t know what hit you ! 	0
WD	16064	If we ’ d chosen an all-girls ’ school , that would be one thing . 	0
WD	16065	I ’ d never found the arguments especially persuasive . 	0
WD	16066	But what really brought me up short was imagining how I would explain the policy to my daughter , whose best friends were boys . 	0
WD	16067	A few years ago , when I was looking at middle schools for my daughter , I heard about a school that sounded lovely except for one thing : it had a policy of separating math classes by gender . 	0
WD	16068	Having reported on a vogue for single-sex classrooms in the nineties , I knew the rationale : girls and boys distract one another ; girls need extra ego boosts and a gentle approach when it comes to studying math and science . 	0
WD	16069	The public schools are not going to get better . 	1
WD	16070	no . teachers keep asking for more with no difference in teaching just more money and if they dont get it what happens they strike . well thats real nice on kids education is it not boo hoo you TAKE YOUR KIDS PRIVATE IF YOU CARE AS I DID 	1
WD	16071	BIG E . what about all the money we do send to our schools . does it help our child . 	0
WD	16072	Now , we are talking about a school-sponsored prayer . 	0
WD	16073	No student-sponsored prayer is , or needs to be , prohibited . 	0
WD	16074	But in the Cold War , America was distinguishing itself from a Communist enemy that was known to be atheistic . 	0
WD	16075	So , the school district in New York decided to develop a prayer which they thought anyone who believed in God could pray . 	0
WD	16076	But you have to look at the background on this . 	0
WD	16077	Our country was initially populated by people escaping religious persecution who were looking for a safe have to practice their own religion . 	0
WD	16078	When we came together as a country , we had a religiously diverse population , so when we wrote the constitution , we had to say that the government would not support any religion at the expense of others , nor would it prohibit the free exercise of religion . 	0
WD	16079	Prayer in public schools was a complicated issue where there was a religious diversity amongst students and teachers , because , how could , say , Catholics and Protestants agree on a prayer to say . 	0
WD	16080	( Those of you who pray , do you ever pray generic prayers ? ) 	0
WD	16081	I am sorry but we are forced through our property taxes to support a system that we do not believe works and shows no sign of improving . 	1
WD	16082	We also incur the additional cost associate with sending our child to a school we feel confident will give her what she need to be successful in life . 	0
WD	16083	So I say Allison Benedikt , treat the cause not the system . 	0
WD	16084	The major thing was that I always felt like the presence of boys would have made the girls far less bitchy ( as they did in my co-ed school experiences ) . 	0
WD	16085	My wife and I live in a very expensive suburb . 	0
WD	16086	We pay very high taxes , most of which are allocated to an adequate school system that is monetarily driven by a broken system designed to teach children the answers to the questions not how they derive at them . 	0
WD	16087	As such there is pressure on the schools to meet the GPA standards that there states put on the schools that they have forgotten why the children are there in the first place . 	0
WD	16088	Every other week we hear stories about another child that has died from an overdose of heroin and how it has become an epidemic in the school systems . 	0
WD	16089	The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( IDEA ) of 1990 requires all schools to provide services for children who need special education in the “ least restrictive environment conducive to learning . ” 	0
WD	16090	And in that aspect , he ' s correct : According to Virginia law , parents who have a religious objection can opt to not only home-school their children but to do so without any government oversight , meaning there is no mandatory curriculum and no checks placed on the family to ensure the children are learning at an appropriate level . 	0
WD	16091	It was previously mentioned in this project that coeducational schools need to adopt a non-stereotyping language and equal opportunity environment to foster equity and success between boys and girls . 	0

WD	16097	Three of my girls were born in August , but there is no question of holding them back . 	1
WD	16098	I am a product and proponent of the public school system , and do my best to support to support local public schools ( especially when it comes to music and arts programs ) whenever possible . 	0

WD	16100	More to the point , US public schools are the best in the world . 	1
WD	16101	So , no special education , no behavior problems , and no unbalanced portion of low socio-economic students coming from families with suspect value of education . 	0
WD	16102	If students fail the high-stakes test in America , schools are forced to pass them on to the next grade , again , because public schools are rarely allowed to enforce retention policies to prevent students from being placed in classes beyond their demonstrable ability . 	0
WD	16103	They are required to teach EVERYONE regardless of ability , income , behavior , etc . . . Other countries have education systems built upon the tract theory where if a student fails a test at a certain grade level , that student moves into an alternative education tract that will prepare them for " career " training at their " ability level . " 	0
WD	16104	The ugly truth about private schools is that these institutions can select who attends through entrance exams and other admissions criteria . 	0
WD	16105	It is absolutely correct . 	0
WD	16106	Public schools have neither option . 	0
WD	16107	They can also enforce consequences for attendance and discipline policies . 	0
WD	16108	We were taught tolerance and acceptance . 	0
WD	16109	Clearly we ’ re off to a great start . 	0
WD	16110	With private schools stealing students away from public schools , the problem is exacerbated further . 	0
WD	16111	This ultimately results in other countries getting to the point where only best are tested and compared internationally , whereas American public schools test EVERY student at EVERY level . 	0
WD	16112	Pulled him out again and put him in a selective school and he ' s loving it . 	0
WD	16113	This could lead to costly court battles , or more children entering into inadequate homeschooling programs . 	0
WD	16114	What if the child ' s parents dissent ? 	0
WD	16115	Although I accept that initial intentions can be noble , sometimes , the language of liberation can carry an unintended payload . 	0

WD	16122	I hope these kids get a chance in life their parents are denying them . 	0
WD	16123	And people who are fortunate enough to send their children to a private school or to , even better , homeschool , are not going to make a difference . 	0
WD	16124	Social advancement ? 	0
WD	16125	Human nature makes the final result , of anything having a lack of competition and guaranteed employment , stagnation for the simple lack of incentive . 	0
WD	16126	Unions and their inherent lack of competition is what is wrong with our schools , government and anything else unions monopolize . 	0
WD	16127	It ' s human nature . 	0
WD	16128	The problem is without competition , the product becomes stale and innovation disappears . 	0
WD	16129	Unions DO NOT like competition ( try walking across a strike line , you SCAB ) . 	0
WD	16130	For years they nearly had one , the result , the sad shape of our public school system . 	0
WD	16131	Public schools want a monopoly . 	0
WD	16132	Those enrolled in private schools still support public schools thru RET ' s like every other property owner . 	0
WD	16133	Whether the result is choosing a state school , independent school or home education will depend on our children , our selves and our family situations . 	0
WD	16134	If we don ' t make decisions based on our ideas and beliefs , our moral values and our understanding of the world - then surely we are failing to do our best for our children . 	0
WD	16135	To say school is best is every bit as ideological as any argument for home education . 	0
WD	16136	But then everyone is . 	0
WD	16137	But they are guided by their own values , beliefs and yes - ideology . 	0
WD	16138	Others come to it later because school has not worked for their child . 	0
WD	16139	Some choose it at the start because their child appears to be unsuited to early formal education , or because they favour education methods not available in state schools . 	0
WD	16140	Home educators come from many backgrounds , with many different beliefs and use many different educational methods - from the very structured , adult-led to the informal , child-led . 	0
WD	16141	Public schools are fad driven . 	0
WD	16142	Remember new math ? 	0
WD	16143	For example , consider the theories that " boys are visual learners " and " girls are auditory learners . " 	0
WD	16144	Their research suggests that learning is best accomplished when the delivery method matches the subject matter . 	0
WD	16145	According to researchers Dr . Rebecca Bigler and Dr . Lise Eliot , " Placing children into classrooms based on their gender and making assumptions about their physiology , brains , interests , and learning ability will virtually guarantee that teachers ' expectations are biased and their gender-based practices are misguided for most of their students . " 	0
WD	16146	Bigler and Eliot maintain that many of the popular ideas about gender learning are simply untrue . 	0
WD	16147	Still , critics of single-sex education contend that the vast majority of research is based on pseudoscience " laughable to neuroscientists . " 	0
WD	16148	The differences that have been identified are considered too small to warrant separating students . 	0
WD	16149	While co-ed schools can reinforce stereotypes , girls and boys can be free to pursue math , science , poetry , or art , without gender role pressure in single-sex environments . 	0
WD	16150	A mother of a single-sex educated girl remarked , " I feel that the single gender environment has given her a level of confidence and informed interest in math and science that she may not have had otherwise . " 	0

WD	16156	There ' s a real possibility that he would have been diagnosed with a disorder when his real problem was lack of maturity . 	0
WD	16157	It would have been a horrible struggle for him to start at age 5 , and he would have been held back anyway . 	0
WD	16158	I try not to be anti-homeschooling , but . . . it ' s just hard for me . 	1
WD	16159	I really haven ' t met any homeschoolers who turned out quite right , including myself . 	0
WD	16160	I apologize if what I ' m saying offends any of you - that ' s not my intention , I know that there are many homeschooled children who do just fine , but that hasn ' t been my experience . 	0

WD	16174	Your public schools in parts of this country have become a cess pool of degenerates and with parents that are about the same . 	0
WD	16175	I would work two jobs if needed to send my kid to a private school ( one that I had done a lot of background checking into first ) . 	0
WD	16176	Not saying that private schools don ' t have problems either but none to the ratio that public schools have . 	0

WD	16190	When I was teaching Intro Psych in SW Virginia in some of community colleges and local colleges I ran into the same thing . 	0
WD	16191	Co-ed schools are also the cause for some boys dropping out of school when in fact the society benefits by keeping these boys engaged in education and make them complete school . some posters here have admitted girls could better benefit by attending single sex-schools than co-ed schools . 	0
WD	16192	The mass socialization within schools has brought about abundant delinquent behavior within our nation ’ s youth , reports education researcher , Dr . Michael Slavinski . 	0

WD	16194	Again it was another of those cases where keeping them uneducated and ignorant keeps them in the church . 	0
WD	16195	I ' m proud to say that my kids attend a private school and have no plans of making a change any time soon ! 	1
WD	16196	Maybe when our public school system gets their priorities straight , like quality education , not quantity education , and not buying unneeded items like bleachers , I ' ll consider sending my kids . . . . wait , nevermind ! 	0
WD	16197	No I won ' t ! 	0
WD	16198	When the average $$ amount spent on educating a child is around $12k and it costs $40k+ to house a prisoner , then that is where one of the problems lies . 	0
WD	16199	What a stupid argument ! 	0
WD	16200	We are all so glib in the way we promise and don ’ t perform and never realize that it is sapping our moral energy . “ Think then , what happens to a nation rife with perjury , broken marriage covenants , unforgiveness , cults with demonic covenants , extortion , bribery , libel , slander , profanity , hypocrisy , idle talk , and lawsuits initiated solely for revenge and personal gain . 	0
WD	16201	And there ’ s the real trouble with this single-sex approach . 	0
WD	16202	Home educators on the other hand can use all these methods as and when appropriate . 	0
WD	16203	Not all people who forego public schools are wealthy , some of had to sacrifice to do it , but it was definitely worth every penny . 	0
WD	16204	I felt I was letting both sides down when teaching in an inclusive secondary in London . 	0
WD	16205	The presumptions behind it are fusty and often plain silly—which might make them easy for kids who don ’ t conform to them to dismiss , except that their teachers and principals are repeating them so earnestly . 	0

WD	16216	This piece of journalism , as have many others ( in both print & broadcast ) focused solely on the superficial and relatively transient perceived benefits of holding your 5-year-old back , while Mr . Safer & team failed to explore any of the real developmental reasons some children really do need to put off kindergarten for a year and how that extra time may benefit them in the short and long term . 	0

WD	16224	Redshirting your 5-year-old solely for the purpose of giving them an advantage in sports , a leg up in the future popularity contest , or just to save them from the horrible fate of being the " youngest " in their class ( and the last to have a driver ' s license ) drives me NUTZ ! 	0

WD	16228	I tended to teach the kids in my class as individuals . 	0
WD	16229	I would also like to add that I personally , in many years in a very mixed comprehensive in Inner London , never took the blindest bit of notice of who was currently " failing " as a group , whether it be black , Asian , white boys , girls or bunny rabbits . 	0
WD	16230	At school , or homeschooled . 	0
WD	16231	The kids that do well and attain up to their optimum levels are the ones with good parental support . 	0
WD	16232	You really can ' t expect a child to listen to a teacher telling them they can succeed , when their parents can ' t be bothered to pick them up after a football match , or send them to school dirty , unwashed . 	0
WD	16233	Sadly , many parents seemed to regard school as a babysitter , not something to be worked with , and were all to ready to blame the teachers or school rather then themselves or the child . 	0
WD	16234	If a teacher can call the parent and get backed up , and work with the parent , then the kid will do well and work through difficulties . 	0
WD	16235	The one factor that I did notice made the biggest difference was , as mentioned above , parenting . 	0
WD	16236	My high school graduating class had fewer than 50 seniors , yet PTA meetings had to be held in the auditorium . 	0

WD	16242	I taught in public high schools for 15 years . 	0
WD	16243	My advice to parents ? 	0
WD	16244	It is time we stop rewarding a bad system , and reform it with the good old reward system that promotes doing better called competition . 	0
WD	16245	The school board for my system was made up of lay people , each of whom had a personal agenda that had nothing to do with education . 	0
WD	16246	In 15 years I never saw a board member visit either of my two schools . 	0
WD	16247	I believe a more disciplined school in the formative teenage years pays off when the child matures . 	0
WD	16248	I know my friend ' s case is rather extreme , but the thing is . . . the vast majority of my homeschooled friends have similar issues . 	0
WD	16249	Many of them are also very over-protected by their parents , and many of them , to be honest , act more like 6th-graders than 10th-graders . 	0

WD	16257	I actually had to go down there one day , find the culprit and set the record straight . 	0
WD	16258	There was to be no cross-contamination between groups ; you had to choose your friends or the queen bees would choose for you . 	0
WD	16259	When I eventually found her , she gave me a snobby and unapologetic , “ Sorry , are we done here ? ” , swiveled on her pink Converse and strutted in the opposite direction . 	0
WD	16260	Not everything in the media is okay . 	0
WD	16261	Being outdoors by yourself can be dangerous . 	0
WD	16262	She acts younger than her age , and I often find that in order to get along with her , I have to act less mature as well . 	0
WD	16263	Now , I understand her parents ' point of view . 	0
WD	16264	But if you ' re going to survive in it , you have to know what you ' re up against . 	0
WD	16265	I can tell you without a doubt that when my friend reaches adulthood and leaves home , she will be stepping into a world that she knows nothing about , and she ' s going to suffer because of it . 	0
WD	16266	Would she send me to a public school now - ABSOLUTELY NOT ! ! ! 	1
WD	16267	I was even a public school high school teacher ! 	0
WD	16268	I trust that was tongue in cheek ? 	0
WD	16269	And , until America starts realizing that education is a privilege that should be supported and respected , where teachers are revered , we are always going to have problems . 	0
WD	16270	But she ' s not a child anymore , she ' s going to legally be an adult in two years , and she does not understand the world at all . 	0
WD	16271	So yes , if you want a strong , no bull , parent supported , child first , customer service-based , " you will follow the rules or you will get kicked out " educational atmosphere where education and discipline and respect are demanded , then you should send your child to a private school . 	0
WD	16272	And as long as the schools live in fear of these parents and " live to serve the public " and don ' t want to anger parents and are worried about their government funding , they are always going to kowtow to pissy parents and weak teachers and administrators . 	0
WD	16273	Yeah , the world is a pretty suckish place , and I can completely understand why any parent would want to shield their child from it . 	0
WD	16274	I can not believe that someone in the room did not beotch slap her for suggesting such lunacy . 	0
WD	16275	There is no more public education , it is all indoctrination , warm and fuzzy political correctness . 	0
WD	16276	She is a total marxist moron . 	0
WD	16277	They have something to lose if they act a fool . 	0
WD	16278	YOU ARE IDIOTS . 	0
WD	16279	I apologize , but your child may be playing violent video games and what not , but when they go out and rape or shoot someone . 	0
WD	16280	Parents are the ones that are supposed to be teaching they ’ re kids values and morals and what is right and wrong . 	0
WD	16281	O ’ and side note all those parents that think that “ Angry Music & Video Games ” are the root of all evil and its what ’ s causing your children to become evil and lash out at society . 	0
WD	16282	SOCIETY SIDE NOTE : The reason that society is bad today is not because of the lack of Fear for God . 	0
WD	16283	It is because of what our society has become . 	0
WD	16284	It will not be because of the video game it will be your lack of parenting , maybe you should have hit them those last few times . 	0
WD	16285	And if any of you are saying “ Well what about the belt ? ” there is a difference between getting a belt to the butt and physically assaulting your child multiple times with your fists . 	0
WD	16286	All parents carefully consider their child ' s education and those decisions are not taken lightly . 	0
WD	16287	The parents think of school as a free baby sitter . 	0
WD	16288	People who send their children to a private school are not “ bad ” people . 	0

WD	16290	They want the best for their kids ! 	0
WD	16291	I have worked for a group that goes into the school systems to talk to the kids . 	0
WD	16292	I think the individual schools themselves and and the individual needs of your daughters are more important than generalisations about education and single-sex or co-ed schools . 	0
WD	16293	However , if you want an opinon from a general education pespective , and you can read up on this , the general rule is that single sex schools are better for the academic performance of your daughters . 	1
WD	16294	Research is quite clear about this . 	0
WD	16295	The children in the private system , are polite , listen to what you are telling them and responsive . 	0
WD	16296	For the benefit of chidlren of course . 	0
WD	16297	I agree - Kids can do great in the public school system and parents DO need to be involved . 	1
WD	16298	It is wasting valuable school time . 	0
WD	16299	I have had parents tell me , I gave birth , my job is over , it is your ( mine , the teachers , ect ) to raise and educate these kids . 	0
WD	16300	It stems from children having kids , forcing them off on the grandparents , and the children thinking that they mother is there sister . 	0
WD	16301	One of the benefits of SEN education arguably benefits all children ; class sizes are smaller ensuring a better teacher to pupil ratio . 	0
WD	16302	How prevalent is redshirting anyway ? 	0
WD	16303	*How many homeschooling families do you know ? * I cited three as specific examples , so you ' re way off already . 	0
WD	16304	*None of them cite a desire to avoid diversity as a reason to homeschool . * There are numerous studies on why people homeschool , and a significant portion of the reasons boil down to " wanted to avoid having my children subjected to opinions , values , beliefs , etc . , that I don ' t agree with .

WD	16306	I will like to start prayer in the schools of Moses Lake , Wa . 	1

WD	16309	I always thought of girls as the sports stars and the valedictorians , because at my school they were . 	0
WD	16310	But when you pray , go into your room , close the door and pray to your Father , who is unseen . 	0
WD	16311	I tell you the truth , they have received their reward in full . 	0
WD	16312	And when you pray , do not keep on babbling like pagans , for they think they will be heard because of their many words . 	0
WD	16313	Then your Father , who sees what is done in secret , will reward you . 	0
WD	16314	This entire article is ridiculous . 	0
WD	16315	Who are you all to say that we need God in our lives . 	0
WD	16316	You can pray quietly whenever you want and does the bible not say in : Matthew 6 : 5-8 “ And when you pray , do not be like the hypocrites , for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men . 	0
WD	16317	You are still allowed to pray in school as long as it doesn ’ t affect the education that the school system is trying to give our children . 	0
WD	16318	All the enrichment camps and afterschool activities will not make up for the fact that your kid is bored for 6-8 hours per day in school and whips through their homework in a flash , or takes all night because they are so bored they can ' t stand it . 	0
WD	16319	I believe that parents should send their kids to the school the best fits the needs of the child at the time . 	0
WD	16320	Yes , parents can provide support and should , but when your child is bored at school , there is only so much you can do to help with that . 	0
WD	16321	Occasionally , you will get lucky and have a teacher that will challenge your kid in class , but if not , then what ? 	0
WD	16322	And it is the cornerstone of a child ’ s well-being , ” Densmore told me . 	0
WD	16323	The National Association for the Education of Young Children offers lots of information about the benefits of play and how parents and teachers can help facilitate it . 	0
WD	16324	Prayer should be back in school to give these kids that are going up a sense of belief , trust and fear of God , because kids these days think they could do anything they want to and get away with it . 	1
WD	16325	On the community level , Densmore encourages parents to take an active role . 	0
WD	16326	Parents should talk with teachers , principals , and other parents . 	0
WD	16327	Look for preschools with facilitated play as the center of their curriculum . 	0
WD	16328	I have only one more problem . 	0
WD	16329	Where would we find enough time for an actual school day ? 	0
WD	16330	This is where the difference is . 	0
WD	16331	Teaching things that contradicting any belief , or lack of belief , is one thing . 	0
WD	16332	Teaching " God " and then praying to that deity is something else , and just as problematic as teaching " no God " then insisting all recite " There is no God " at some point in the school day over and over . 	0
WD	16333	Now if those who would prefer the be public school prayer have no problem with children reciting that last one too , and also showing similar respect to any other deity ( ies ) any of them might possibly believe in , or their family does . 	0

WD	16345	And if the answer to that is " Maybe , but those children are still alive " , then consider this : an estimated 16 children per year commit suicide because of problems at school . 	0
WD	16346	Even the language of the serious case review demonstrates this failure of understanding . 	0
WD	16347	Small wonder that home-educating parents are afraid of conferring power on people who do not know what it is that they are judging . 	0
WD	16348	This is particularly so for families who have taken children out of school ; they would be in the insidious position of being answerable to a system that they believe has already failed them . 	0
WD	16349	The idea that you can protect children simply by increasing government involvement ignores the difficulties the education system itself imposes on the lives of many families . 	0

WD	16362	Here ' s a suggestion : why don ' t we all stop pretending that Canada is this utopian place where everyone holds hands and sings about buying the world a coke in their own language . 	0
WD	16363	I find it simply offensive that Christianity is seen as some sort of imperialistic oppressive practice even when the majority of the students in the class are Christian , because it makes students of other faiths ' uncomfortable , yet any other religion cries racism when the situation is reversed . 	0
WD	16364	If my memory serves me correctly , there has been plenty of controversy over reciting the Lord ' s Prayer in schools , yet this special status has been given to Muslim students , in this case . 	0

WD	16372	These beliefs on the effects of homeschooling on socialization have led to numerous studies on homeschooled kids . 	0
WD	16373	Rather than prove these beliefs to be correct , they show a very clear picture that homeschooled children and teens present a distinct advantage over their peers in public school . 	0
WD	16374	Because of the growing incidences of peer pressure and bullying , violence , drugs , promiscuity and moral relativism , the greater is the belief of parents that they need to take their kids out of public school before these influences have a detrimental effect on both their lives and their future . 	0
WD	16375	It is ironic to say the least that in Dr . Brian Ray ’ s California study , around 92 percent of public school superintendents harbors the erroneous notions that homeschooled kids are socially impaired , emotionally unstable , and “ too judgmental ” of their community and the world in general . 	0
WD	16376	President Theodore Roosevelt once said , “ To educate a man in mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to society . ” 	0
WD	16377	This is an ideal that is being espoused by homeschooling parents who no longer wish to expose their children to the questionable teachings and people that are a part of the public school system . 	0
WD	16378	Teachers , on the other hand , are afraid that they will lose their jobs to more effective parents who are not even certified educators . 	0
WD	16379	It is not surprising , therefore , that they would constantly put down homeschooling as not an effective form of education , specifically targeting the “ lack of social skills ” as a main point against homeschoolers . 	0

WD	16395	Additionally , it is said that homeschooled children do well on standardised tests , and as adults , are known to be self-directed learners and reliable employees . 	0
WD	16396	On the other hand , as a family member recently pointed out to me , by homeschooling children we could be stunting the development of their socialisation skills . 	0
WD	16397	I make that point because teachers specialise in specific subject areas and if parents choose to homeschool their children , it is expected that they would have vast knowledge of each subject area which they choose to teach their children . 	0
WD	16398	Research in the United States has shown that homeschooling is growing at a rate of seven to 15 per cent per year , with millions of children currently learning at home . 	0
WD	16399	Indeed , that is a distinct possibility and the onus would have to be on the parents to ensure that does not happen . 	0
WD	16400	And , some studies indicate that children who are redshirted also have higher use of special education services in elementary school and higher rates of behavioral problems in adolescence . 	0
WD	16401	I ' m always fasinated by the ideology argument . 	0

WD	16426	Private and parochial schools are more likely to adhere to the same value system as the families whose kids attend them , while public schools tend to reflect the values of whatever politician is in charge of them at the moment . 	0

WD	16432	It appears that it can , at least for the first few years of elementary school , and this is especially true for kids who are already at risk for school difficulties due to socio-economic factors ( unfortunately those are also the kids who are least likely to start later ) . 	0

WD	16443	The standard was set at the lowest common denominator with no effort put into challenge children who were bored . 	0
WD	16444	They need to bring back classes where all children ' s needs are met not just the worst behaved , why should the whole class be punished because one child ' s behaviour . 	0
WD	16445	Composite classes should be discouraged as teachers are unable to meet all the levels needed and are more likely to ignore those who can do the work at the higher grade . 	0

WD	16503	And if any part of that made no sense , just point it out . 	0
WD	16504	I think putting a 4 year old on kindergarten is more about the parents need to prove how superior their child is than it is about what is best for the child Or , more likely , it ' s a low to middle income parent , and they ' d rather send the child to school than pay for another year of daycare while they work . 	0

WD	16525	No , you are not a " bad " person if you send your kids to private school . 	0
WD	16526	Most public schools cannot handle really " bright " kids . 	0
WD	16527	This is especially true at the elementary school level where they have to teach to the middle at best and the lower achieving kids most of the time . 	0
WD	16528	Why ? 	0
WD	16529	They have to teach to the test , so their focus is making sure their kids will pass the standardized tests that are given . 	0

WD	16551	Yet there is a consistent failure on the part of local authorities and government reviews to grasp even the basis of the ideas that can underlie a different kind of education . 	0
WD	16552	Evidence including our own suggests strongly that this kind of education prepares children to enter further and higher education , or the workforce – and offers them the freedom to learn in the ways that suit them best . 	0
WD	16553	We have half-a-year which means A LOT can change before kindergarten ( besides , since when did kids have to be perfect for kindergarten ? ) . 	0
WD	16554	It is here that home educators have their strongest reservations . 	0

WD	16556	Research by ourselves at the University of London ' s Institute of Education has shown how diverse individual learners are , and therefore the diversity of ways in which their needs can best be met . 	0

WD	16559	Home education can range from the highly structured , based on set curriculums and lessons , to the completely informal . 	0
WD	16560	That school should be the benchmark against which all education is measured is resented by many home educators . 	0
WD	16561	While officials talk the language of individualism and chances for everybody , home educators are in a position to deliver precisely that kind of tailor-made education . 	0
WD	16562	After more than 25 years of severe moral decline is it not time to repent , reverence the name of the Lord , reinstitute and keep the third commandment ? 	0
WD	16563	I believe everyone deserves an education , and much more than the 12 years we get , but I also believe I have a choice to do what I feel is best for my children ! 	0
WD	16564	As a matter of fact , as a homeowner , I am supporting both systems , much more than those less fortunate can . 	0
WD	16565	You actively , with forethought , work to deny your child an education ? 	0
WD	16566	Just a thought - the way it works in my community is REAL ESTATE TAXES fund our public schools . 	0
WD	16567	Therefore I am not taking ANYTHING away from the public school system by sending my sons to private school . 	0
WD	16568	It would be silly to sacrifice him to public schools to make them better . 	0
WD	16569	In recent years , the biggest gains in education occurred when governments eliminated user fees to deliver on the right to education , leading to tens of millions of children enrolling in school for the first time , and supporting low-cost private schools mocks the importance of that evidence . 	0
WD	16570	It comes from 2 Chronicles 7 : 14 which is summarized as “ If we pray , seek , turn ; then God hears , forgives , heals . ” 	0
WD	16571	As I moved from middle school into high school , my friends moved from homeschool to public school . 	0
WD	16572	* He ’ s in the 90th percentile for height and weight so he runs no risk of being picked on for smallness . 	0
WD	16573	The article is written from the professor ' s perspective and he writes about his experience in teaching Jonas and some of the issues that he felt Jonas dealt with in the class . 	0
WD	16574	In the article , the professor describes the first day of class and how Jonas asked him if there would be a paper required for the course in which the professor responded that was how the previous course was taught and that he would solicit the thoughts of the class and he noticed how Jonas ' demeanor changed with his answer . 	0
WD	16575	Granted , public education , like most other government programs , is corrupt at it ' s core and an administrative nightmare , it needs to be completely overhauled , but the fact remains that the populace needs to be educated and if not forced by law , a lot of parents simply wouldn ' t bother , paying for their kid ' s education gets in the way of the new car and the designer jeans . 	1
WD	16576	If you come out on the other side deficient , it ’ s hard to make up for that . 	0
WD	16577	There are many elements that come into play when mainstreaming special education students into regular education settings . 	0
WD	16578	Teachers will need to educate themselves so they can learn different strategies to teach two diverse groups , exceptional students and " regular " students , in the same classroom . 	0
WD	16579	The inclusive classroom is different in that the individualized styles of learning and needs of the students fall outside the normal parameter . 	0
WD	16580	Sometimes it is not only the teacher that is resistant but the exceptional students as well are resistant to the change in educational setting because they are used to being separated from the mainstream of school life . 	0
WD	16581	This is where teamwork will become important between the school , the students , and the teachers . 	0
WD	16582	The inclusive classroom is a different dynamic so everyone will have to adjust but the transition will be easier with cooperation from everyone . 	0
WD	16583	I read an article on a particular student named Jonas , a previous special education high school student , and his experience in a college setting . 	0
WD	16584	Jonas is presently a special education assistant or para-professional in a urban high school and he is taking the undergraduate course , Critical Issues in School , to complete his degree . 	0
WD	16585	Second , special education students typically have some modifications or accommodations written in their Individualized Education Plan . 	0
WD	16586	For a special education student , this is magnified tremendously . 	0
WD	16587	Traditional students also try to refrain from asking questions in class because they don ' t want to look dumb . 	0
WD	16588	I say that because I love my country and it really bothers me to see our politicians drag us down further and further in to the abyss . 	0
WD	16589	When classes are filled with 36 to 40 students per class , one-on-one instruction becomes impossible . 	0
WD	16590	In addition , special education students tend to need more one-on-one instruction without distractions . 	0
WD	16591	This means that the students choose to take the test in class — and have attention drawn to them because they get special treatment in other students eyes — or they take their test in the testing center where they can have more privacy . 	0
WD	16592	Oftentimes , their plan allows them to use notes , a calculator and / or textbooks on tests . 	0
WD	16593	I pay taxes that go to the local school system that my children don ' t attend on both my residential property and business properties and I pay the private school tuition . 	0
WD	16594	And as a parent of two " youngest in the class " , I wonder if these redshirt parents ' choice will be subjecting other children , who ' s parents followed the rules , to a school life of struggling to keep up with classmates that should actually be in another class ? 	0
WD	16595	I have always taken time to help as many students as possible , both traditional and special education students . 	0
WD	16596	Lastly , special education teachers catch on quickly which traditional teachers are going to take the time to help the kids on their case load . 	0
WD	16597	Redshirting - does it really buy your child a long-term advantage in school and in life ? 	0
WD	16598	We choose to be the primary influence in our children ’ s life and know it is the right decision for our family . 	0
WD	16599	In fact , the National Home Education Research Institute disclosed that the 36 to 54 hours that students spend in school-related weekly activities make peers and adults outside of the home the primary influences in children ' s lives - not the parents . 	0
WD	16600	But lack of socialization for homeschoolers is really just a myth that holds no weight and is not a valid reason to not consider homeschooling . 	0
WD	16601	Each parent and family must make the decision to do what is best for them whether it be public school or homeschool . 	0
WD	16602	Mr . Safer also failed to examine the long-term effects of redshirting on children as the proceed thru their academic life . 	0
WD	16603	I sure hope somebody is out there studying these old , bigger , more mature students as they progress thru their school years ? 	0
WD	16604	I was all alone my freshmen year , by my senior year , there were enough high school homeschoolers to count on two hands . 	0
WD	16605	I think the best way to get Public schools to be better and for the system to be fairer is for parents to be given vouchers for the amount public schools would receive for your child ' s education and for the parents to have a choice of where to send their children . 	0
WD	16606	I think that where inclusion is being considered , it has to be carefully planned to meet the childs needs . 	0
WD	16607	Just because the vast majority of home educators are good , loving and decent parents cannot mean that the few children at risk *must* be ignored to give you all privacy . 	0
WD	16608	The subjects were deemed too difficult to teach at home . 	0
WD	16609	Public schools will never get better until they have competition . 	0
WD	16610	so my kids should suffer for the school systems down fall while we figure it out . . . . news flash change takes time and you only have kids in school for a short time . . . . 	0
WD	16611	I wish . 	0
WD	16612	No one is claiming " the professionals " are the only ones who can teach . 	0
WD	16613	Teachers in schools are also subject to intrusive checks , the assumption that they would abuse a child as soon as look at them and constant surveillance . 	0
WD	16614	I will always be happy they were happy there , despite my misery . 	0
WD	16615	And so children die . 	0
WD	16616	If no one is checking up , no one has noticed their child ' s bruises and withdrawal and misery . 	0
WD	16617	So , some parents take their children out of school and abuse them so they do not get caught . 	0
WD	16618	What this is about is when a child is being abused by parents , teachers notice and they report it . 	0
WD	16619	It is just a Get of Jail Free card to a very small minority of people . 	0
WD	16620	It is not a widespread problem , no one is claiming that . 	0
WD	16621	There is no way to tell who any of us would have been different without having the experience . 	0
WD	16622	Public schools have failed at their purpose because they have lost their purpose . 	0
WD	16623	Comes up in conversation ? 	0
WD	16624	I don ' t hide it . 	0
WD	16625	" they want to put her in G&T " -- now seriously , it ' s not jealousy - my ODD is identified gifted and I don ' t brag to the world about it . 	0
WD	16626	It ' s our deal . 	0
WD	16627	Got one friend who held her kid back in K because she was immature ( August birthday ) . 	0
WD	16628	Now she ' s in 2nd and all I hear is " she ' s so smart " " she ' s bored . " 	0
WD	16629	But this holding them back because they are immature ? 	1
WD	16630	No way - not a good reason IMO . . . because they will grow up , , they will mature . 	1
WD	16631	Also has anyone considered that maybe the reason many " redshirted " kids to not do as well academically is because their parents waited a year to start them because they did not feel they were ready and maybe they are just not academic performers . 	0
WD	16632	I ' m all for redshirting kids who are not academically ready . 	0
WD	16633	Nope , public school not for me ! 	1
WD	16634	Who in their right mind would want their children to have to rely on an education from one of those to prepare them for life ? 	0
WD	16635	You ' ve got to be kidding . 	0
WD	16636	The public school system the way it is now is not an option . 	1
WD	16637	Plus , I live in a right wing state whose legislators take books out of libraries on religious grounds and who tried to remove teaching the theory of evolution . 	0
WD	16638	This is still a country where your successes do provide some benefits . 	0
WD	16639	Education is one . 	0
WD	16640	I hope that the government doesn ' t make that impossible to . 	0
WD	16641	Just look at public schools . 	0
WD	16642	If you want what is best for your child , you ' ll send them to a private school . 	1
WD	16643	I think the idea that sending all children to public schools is a poor way to bring public education up to grade . 	0
WD	16644	Most would say , not at the expense of my child , and they would be right . 	0
WD	16645	The entire socialist mentality has no place here in the United States . 	0
WD	16646	I am going to be starting a single sex school but am not intimidated by this at all , as it was not just my parents choice but mine too , alot of people I know quite well go there and enjoy it tremendisly . 	0
WD	16647	Its just a debate that has two extremely good arguments on both sides 	0
WD	16648	Not sure how it would have turned out if we ' d sent him straight through , but I can attest that he is a leader in all things he does – athletically , professionally , and socially . 	0
WD	16649	Testimony : My son , now 25 , was held back by going to Transitional first grade ( T1 ) . 	0
WD	16650	I believe that his going the T1 route was a part of what worked for us . 	0
WD	16651	He was awarded a full athletic college scholarship ; voted captain of his team by his teammates for three years , and earned another scholarship to get his masters ; and had several generous job offers to choose from upon graduating . 	0
WD	16652	I know it ' s a tough decision to make – best of luck to those trying to make the decision , I know its tough and is different for each child . 	0
WD	16653	I am a loving , knowledgeable , intelligent and successful individual that wants to do all that I can to prepare my children and give them a great life . 	0
WD	16654	These parents are paying for public schools as well with tax dollars . 	0
WD	16655	People sending their kids to private schools and homeschooling actual helps the public schools . 	0
WD	16656	By helping pay for it , but not sending their children there , they are increasing the amount of funds that are available per student . 	0
WD	16657	Constitutionally , Canada has no religion , although some mistakenly believe we are a Christian nation even though legally that argument has no ground . 	0
WD	16658	Lets keep it that way . 	0
WD	16659	There is no place for religion in schools nor should taxpayers subsidize any religion ' s prayer services . 	1
WD	16660	I do not care if the person is Christian , Muslim , Jewish , Hindu , Zorastrian , Buddhist , Jainist , Wiccan , Protestant , Catholic , Orthodox , or Pagan their beliefs belong in premises financed by their believers not the government . 	0
WD	16661	My decision was based solely on those points as found by our exhaustive research of what was available to us in our area . 	0
WD	16662	Allowing prayer in schools leads to prosetylization and that is unacceptable . 	0
WD	16663	Nobody needs to be practicing religion at a public school . 	1
WD	16664	The whole point is to separate education from religion . 	0
WD	16665	If you want your kid learning and praying in the same place then send them to a religious school . 	0
WD	16666	if you had to do something and be child free during that time , the munchkins went to gramma or the teenage girl 3 doors down the block . 	0
WD	16667	your kid turned 5 , you sent them to KINDERGARTEN , boom , done . 	0
WD	16668	too often , parents are doing it because it ' s the done thing now , not because they have any sense that it will actually benefit their child ; someone said it was a good idea , so they did it . we didn ' t put our daughter in day care , pre-school , or 4K ; ppl thought we were nuts . 	0
WD	16669	now , parents do all this crap to give their kids a leg up , get them ahead of their peers , send them to umpteen different activities , get them in pre-school , and now this redshirting thing . 	0
WD	16670	dept . on the cheap , the dance classes , soccer , softball , on and on ad nauseum . 	0
WD	16671	this idea that kids need just one more year to be a kid . . . perhaps for some parents , there ' s some truth to it . when i was a kid , back in the dark ages , there wasn ' t day care , pre-school , 4 year old kindergarten , we didn ' t have all these things kids can do via the rec . 	0
WD	16672	there wasn ' t even the designation of 5K ; there was just KINDERGARTEN . 	0
WD	16673	when i was a kid , i was allowed to be a kid until kindergarten , where my mother had the choice of half day or full day kindergarten . 	0
WD	16674	There are many religions that do not pray to their gods , and some that don ' t have any gods whatsoever . 	0
WD	16675	2 ) The 1st amendment clearly establishes ( heh heh get it ) that the government may not sponsor a religion . 	0
WD	16676	One of the biggest myths about homeschooled kids is that they are poorly socialized . 	0
WD	16677	A study by the Canadian Center for Home Education found homeschooled young people at 15-34 years of age more socially engaged ( 67% ) compared with their public school educated peers ( 44% ) . 	0
WD	16678	It ' s not . 	0
WD	16679	4 ) It forces children to think that religion is okay . 	0
WD	16680	Prayer is solely religious in nature . 	0
WD	16681	3 ) Not only that , but the 1st amendment has been interpreted to mean that the government may not sponsor religion in general . 	0
WD	16682	I found it fascinating that homeschooled children , who are not being taught to the test , on the whole do much better than their public school counterparts . 	0
WD	16683	The statistics showing the higher test scores may be skewed because parents of homeschooled kids are not required to take or report scores for standardized tests in many states . 	0
WD	16684	Homeschooled students do have more time to pursue extracurricular activities as opposed to their exhausted public school peers . 	0
WD	16685	Teachers teach to the test because that is what they are instructed to do by administrations that are under pressure for government funding . 	0
WD	16686	Some parents bring in tutors or enroll their children in enrichment programs driving up the cost . 	0
WD	16687	Many parents recycle curriculum among siblings , get groups together for the group rate when visiting museums , and get free materials from the library or online to cut costs . 	0
WD	16688	In public school everyone must take standardized tests and schools must report the scores . 	0
WD	16689	The cost of homeschooling varies widely . 	0
WD	16690	It really is that simple . 	0
WD	16691	But the state ( including the public schools ) cannot mandate , sponsor , conduct , or otherwise officially sanction prayer . 	1
WD	16692	Private individuals can pray whenever and wherever they want ; no one ’ s personal freedoms are being abridged in this regard . 	1
WD	16693	( They can ’ t even offer to lead purely “ voluntary ” prayers with an “ opt out ” option for non-praying students ; that ’ s still a form of religious participation and support , on an official basis , by the state — which is flatly unconstitutional ) . 	0
WD	16694	Ergo , public schools ( e . g . , the state ) may not lead or conduct prayers . 	0
WD	16695	U . S . public schools , being government-run and taxpayer-supported , are part of “ the state . ” 	0
WD	16696	The state may not establish , endorse , promote , sponsor , or conduct prayers . 	0
WD	16697	Individuals may freely exercise their religion of choice , and give free expression to their own private religious preferences ; however , the state cannot do likewise ( because the U . S . Constitution also mandates that the state may not promote , endorse , or otherwise “ establish ” religion ) . 	0
WD	16698	However , teachers on duty in public schools are not acting as private individuals , but as employees ( and hence representatives ) of the state . 	0
WD	16699	It is sometimes objected that teachers ’ rights of religious expression and free speech are being violated , if they are forbidden to lead students in prayer . 	0
WD	16700	However , when they want to pray out loud or with a group , I consider that a disruption and therefore not acceptable . 	0
WD	16701	While one child may be an extreme extrovert and need to be surrounded by students and in a classroom , another may be an extreme introvert , overwhelmed and anxious in the classroom . 	0
WD	16702	The private and Catholic schools were grew out of the need created because the public schools sucked " first " . 	0
WD	16703	If the failing public schools were to suddenly get better because the parents whose kids are ' stuck ' there demanded better , likely the parents of private school kids would put their kids back in public schools . 	0
WD	16704	If the problems could be solved by more involved parents ( and a majority of them probably can be ) , then put the onus on the remaining parents to rise up and get more involved . 	0
WD	16705	You ' re blaming people who choose to walk away in disgust ( often while paying tax money ANYWAY to subsidize failure ) yet ignoring the obvious . 	0
WD	16706	IF this were true , then why don ' t the parents whose kids ARE in the public school system work to improve it ? 	0
WD	16707	They deserve better . 	0
WD	16708	If the atmosphere in the school is right , if the pastoral care excellent than I feel that the co-ed environment creates a vibrant , exciting , stimulating school but also a more relaxed and less stressful climate . 	0
WD	16709	As a boy in a boarding school myself many years ago , which was single sex until A levels , the arrival of girls in the sixth form was the worst possible distraction to teenage boys about to embark serious exams . 	0
WD	16710	Girls also feel the pressure of exam much more than boys and in their teenage years exam pressure can become very intense with often very serious negative consequences . 	0
WD	16711	My experience in a secondary co-ed is that the co-ed situation does deflect some of this tension . 	0
WD	16712	But in my opinion it should be from 2-18 . 	0
WD	16713	Boys and girls perhaps learn differently and approach work in different ways . 	0
WD	16714	If a school is aware of this and teachers can adapt styles and vary their teaching strategies – I see co-eds as both a more natural and realistic preparation for the fast approaching lesson of adult life . 	1
WD	16715	This can cause children to not experience as much about society and those different from them as they would in a public or private school setting . 	0
WD	16716	Experiences are left out of childhood that could have been gained through attendance at school in a multicultural classroom . 	0
WD	16717	Finances Finances can be difficult for families when children are homeschooled . 	0
WD	16718	With one parent teaching children in the comfort of your own home , the other is left to be sole " breadwinner , " and that can place a burden on a family ' s budget . 	0
WD	16719	Many schools also provide a free lunch to students in order to aid families during this tough economic time , something that cannot be offered while homeschooling . 	0
WD	16720	Isolation from Differences Children are isolated from differences in race , ethnicity , age and culture when being homeschooled . 	0
WD	16721	Ideally , I don ’ t think school children should spend as much time as they usually do isolated by age , let alone sex . 	1
WD	16722	The unhealthiest social situations I was ever in were an all-boys school and military training . 	0
WD	16723	In a rough analogy to monocultural farming , I think than any highly homogeneous group of people , while it offers certain efficiencies , is inherently pathology prone . 	0
WD	16724	Diversity damps extremes of outlook , need and behavior . 	0
WD	16725	She compares the push toward mainstreaming students from special education classes to the 1980s movement to downsize mental health institutes , which resulted in an increase in homelessness because individuals could no long receive needed supports . 	0

WD	16727	Dr . Densmore doesn ’ t believe that holding kids back from kindergarten entry is the total solution . 	0
WD	16728	Lesson plans ( and the national curriculum ) are the death of real education . 	0
WD	16729	Others may differ , but I always think , isn ’ t high school supposed to transition you into the world , college , and life on your own ? 	0
WD	16730	Girls were said to be hitting a self-esteem barrier in junior high , when they would droop like Ophelias in need of reviving . 	0
WD	16731	The reformers ’ talk was all about “ How Schools Shortchange Girls ” ( the title of a much-discussed report from the American Association of University Women ) or were “ Failing at Fairness ” ( the title of a 1994 book ) for young women . 	0
WD	16732	My view on the subject is no . 	1
WD	16733	and I actually do feel like co-ed schools develop a girl better socially and emotionally than all-girls schools , just from the mere fact that a girl will get to interact with boys on a daily basis . 	0
WD	16734	As Halpern and her co-authors point out , there are some excellent single-sex programs , and some can point to real gains , but often these can be attributed to selection bias—the children involved were more committed students—and to the motivation and sense of mission among teachers and staff . 	0
WD	16735	In an article called , bluntly , “ The Pseudoscience of Single-Sex Schooling , ” which was co-authored by Diane Halpern , a research psychologist at Claremont McKenna college , and published in Science magazine this fall , Halpern et al . conclude that “ there is no well-designed research showing that single-sex education improves students ’ academic performance . ” 	0
WD	16736	A woman whose daughters attend one of the West Virginia middle schools with boys ’ and girls ’ classes contributed an article this week to the A . C . L . U . Web site in which she pointed out that her school ’ s all-male classes operated on the humane assumption that many kids concentrate better if they ’ re permitted to move about a bit . 	0
WD	16737	When I was reporting on single-sex education experiments in the nineties , one of the things I noticed was that teaching methods enthusiastically billed as better for girls , like hands-on science demonstrations , or mixing word problems in with more standard equations , would be better for anyone without a natural bent for math or science . 	0
WD	16738	She thought , reasonably enough , that some girls might benefit from a little of the same freedom . 	0
WD	16739	In the boys ’ classes , students could lounge in beanbag chairs and run around outside sometimes to “ blow off steam . ” 	0
WD	16740	In the nineties , it was girls . 	0
WD	16741	What has changed since the nineties is the notion of who single-sex education is supposed to help most . 	0
WD	16742	We should make the public system as good as possible for those who can ' t afford it but if parents want their kids to get a better education than the system provides don ' t stop them . 	0
WD	16743	I went to a private school and the public system could never have given me the same experience and quality education . 	0

WD	16745	He enjoys his preschool activities but if he had to do everything over again , I envision lots of fussing about going to school . 	0
WD	16746	Mornings would be ugly . 	0
WD	16747	Besides , the biggest detriment of preschool boredom is associating disinterest with school . 	0
WD	16748	No one wants a kid to develop the habit of tuning out . 	0
WD	16749	Ryan also is like me in that he ’ s observant and listening intensely , although if you didn ’ t know him , or me , you might think we ’ re not paying attention . 	0
WD	16750	But trust me , we have mentally filed away every detail of interest and can almost recite word-for-word what was said . 	0
WD	16751	Here ’ s another thing : A bored Ryan is trouble waiting to happen . 	0
WD	16752	I cannot imagine him spending a year not moving forward with his learning . 	0
WD	16753	They pay most , if not all of the taxes that support the socialistic schools . 	0
WD	16754	Just who do you think pays for the schools ? 	0
WD	16755	A very few excel , but they are the type who would have exceled even without schooling , so they exceled in spite of public schools . 	0
WD	16756	I went to both single sex and co-ed high schools , and I feel the later made it easier to build cross gender friendships that weren ' t just hormone driven . 	0
WD	16757	I believe that envy is one of the carnal sins . 	0
WD	16758	It ' d be good to read up on the literature . 	0
WD	16759	My first thoughts are that it would be more likely to produce an objectified view even with regular cross school events . 	0
WD	16760	Yes , private school is expensive but not every parent that sends their kid to private school is well to do . 	0
WD	16761	My husband and I both work and make good money , but allowing him to go to private school took some thought in regards to our budget . 	0
WD	16762	I suggest reading a blog I wrote earlier this year titled “ Parents , Sports and Church . ” 	0
WD	16763	All I would add to its words would be that as someone who played competitive sports himself at almost every level , and saw my homeschooled kids engage them at almost every level as well , it ’ s a red herring . 	0

WD	16770	He would come home so frustrated because the teacher spent most of the class trying to get everyone to focus and pay attention that by the time the bell rang to go to the next class they were left to figure out the lesson for the day on their own or go to tutoring after school which is what he would do . 	0

WD	16787	If Muslims are required by their religion to pray several ( is it 6 ? ) times a day , and this space is being allotted so the Muslim youth can practice their religion properly . . . why is this prayer only being conducted once per week ? 	0
WD	16788	This timetable would seem in opposition of what their faith demands . 	0
WD	16789	I am convinced more satisfaction is gained from the fact that they will be allowed to halfheartedly practice their faith in a public school rather than actually practicing their faith properly an a place of worship . 	0

WD	16835	Our culture has declared war on children in so many ways . 	0
WD	16836	Let ’ s take a look at this . 	0
WD	16837	There seems to be a myth that homeschoolers do not receive proper socialization . 	0
WD	16838	This usually comes from people who do not understand homeschooling or those deeply involved in public education . 	0
WD	16839	In reality , the majority of homeschoolers are provided with plenty of social opportunities . 	0
WD	16840	There has been much discussion regarding homeschooling lately . 	0
WD	16841	He has had no problems so far in Kindergarten . 	0
WD	16842	As a homeschooling parent of five children for over a decade , the most frequent question I receive is , “ what about socialization ? ” 	0
WD	16843	A woman recently contacted me saying she desired to homeschool her child but the socialization issue was keeping her from doing so . 	0
WD	16844	Well , getting drunk before basketball games with kids who lived at the trailer park near my house did the same for me . 	0
WD	16845	Reading Walt Whitman in ninth grade changed the way you see the world ? 	0
WD	16846	As rotten as my school ’ s English , history , science , social studies , math , art , music , and language programs were , going to school with poor kids and rich kids , black kids and brown kids , smart kids and not-so-smart ones , kids with superconservative Christian parents and other upper-middle-class Jews like me was its own education and life preparation . 	0
WD	16847	I ' m happy with my choice and it was comforting to read this article of support for my decision . 	1
WD	16848	Take two things from this on your quest to become a better person : 1 ) Your child will probably do just fine without “ the best , ” so don ’ t freak out too much , but 2 ) do freak out a little more than my parents did—enough to get involved . 	0
WD	16849	( Can you imagine ? ) 	0
WD	16850	They sent me there because that ’ s where we lived , and they weren ’ t too worried about it . 	0
WD	16851	By the way : My parents didn ’ t send me to this shoddy school because they believed in public ed . 	0
WD	16852	My son turned 5 one week before the cut-off . 	0
WD	16853	Many of my ( morally bankrupt ) colleagues send their children to private schools . 	0
WD	16854	He is in a full day Kindergarten and seems to be doing well , considering he is the youngest in the class . 	0
WD	16855	In reality , children and teens are locked behind gates on campus , are segregated by age , are forced to remain silent in class unless called by the teacher , and whose schedules are determined by the blare of school bells . 	0
WD	16856	In contrast , a homeschooler ’ s “ classroom ” is the world around him / her . 	0
WD	16857	Parents don ’ t just limit teaching their children in the living or dining room . 	0
WD	16858	They hold lessons in parks , libraries or museums . 	0
WD	16859	However , Dr . Thomas Smedley debunked these assumptions when he did a study on homeschooled kids . 	0
WD	16860	Last year , his pre-school teacher recommended that I hold him back and keep him in Pre-K one more year . 	0
WD	16861	Homeschooled children scored very high in the 84th percentile compared to public school students who scored at an abysmal 23rd percentile . 	0
WD	16862	Public schools argue that their kids are better socialized . 	0
WD	16863	Pre-K was only 3 hours long , while Kindergarten was a full day . 	0
WD	16864	They take weekly field trips to places of interest in the community , including churches , colleges , hospitals , fire departments , city halls , and even repair shops . 	0
WD	16865	Indeed , parents ensure that their kids are able to interact with people of all ages , and not just with their peers . 	0
WD	16866	If you want to chat with your invisible , supernatural friend do so off school property and on your own time . 	0
WD	16867	Our education system ( as with our government ) must remain secular and free from these silly distractions . 	0
WD	16868	NO PRAYER IN SCHOOLS ! . . . period . 	1
WD	16869	While there are many arguments for homeschooling children , there are several reasons that parents might not want to pursue this educational option . 	0
WD	16870	This large step should be considered carefully before children are either homeschooled or enrolled at a public institution . 	0
WD	16871	Homeschooling allows children to move at their own learning pace , yet it can socially isolate them . 	0
WD	16872	Homeschooling is beneficial for some , but may not be right for every family . 	0
WD	16873	Also , teaching itself can be difficult , as parents usually haven ' t earned a degree in education and occasionally they don ' t even have any kind of post-secondary education . 	0
WD	16874	Social Networks Children who are homeschooled can lack the social interaction gained by having classmates . 	0
WD	16875	Teaching Many parents find the variety of choices and lesson plans that can be used for homeschooling overwhelming . 	0
WD	16876	Since there are no laid out plans for teaching , homeschooling can be a great deal of work for parents , and occasionally confusing for children . 	0
WD	16877	This can be difficult for children as they can be socially isolated unless parents create their own social groups through sports , extracurricular activities or religious organizations . 	0
WD	16878	The value of learning how to get along with others and develop social skills that will be needed throughout life is an important part of the education experience . 	0
WD	16879	My child changes every year and so will his needs . 	1
WD	16880	So bored ! 	0
WD	16881	NONE . 	0
WD	16882	I can ' t imagine tossing them into PreK again for another year . 	0
WD	16883	They would be so bored . 	0
WD	16884	My kids would be bored to tears in Kindergarten if we waited a year . 	0
WD	16885	As it is they already enter Kindy grade level comfortable in 1st grade math / 1-2nd grade reading level . 	0
WD	16886	I have seen it from all angles and am now seeing it from the parent ' s angle . 	1
WD	16887	Actually , my son had a homeschooled boy on his hockey team for several years . 	0
WD	16888	Home educated children are also more involved in their communities , as are adults who were homeschooled . 	0
WD	16889	The top reason my friends say they didn ’ t consider homeschooling is because they are sure their kids won ’ t listen to them . 	0
WD	16890	He socialized just fine and was exceptionally bright , though judging from his fascination with my garage door opener , seemed a bit sheltered . 	0
WD	16891	Many readers addressed this saying it ’ s a matter of discipline and good parenting . 	0
WD	16892	I have to say , I ’ m with them . 	0
WD	16893	Someone out there should start a consulting business teaching parents how to get their kids to listen to them while homeschooling . 	0
WD	16894	Although there is a huge homeschool community out there that makes it work , I still can ’ t imagine my boys cooperating . 	0
WD	16895	Christian prayer in schools is not a problem because the Christian holy day of the week is Sunday - a day when there is no school . 	0
WD	16896	He went in a boy and came out a god-loving man of character ! 	0
WD	16897	The subject of homeschool shouldn ' t open a firestorm of debate anymore than mentioning a child is going to public school opens a debate . 	0
WD	16898	This is after all a free country . 	0
WD	16899	It depends on what you think a Christian is . 	0
WD	16900	There are too many who try to use the government and our schools to force their religion on everyone . 	0
WD	16901	Not surpirsingly the worst behavior problems are lower potential and high potential students . 	0
WD	16902	But you are free to carry a Bible until you use it to violate the rights of others . 	0
WD	16903	Well , of course the whole Bible isn ' t mythology . 	0
WD	16904	There is some religious laws , there is a lot of poetry , there is some history , and there is a lot of mythology . 	0
WD	16905	How else should Genesis be characterized ? 	0
WD	16906	Nonsense . 	0
WD	16907	As an agent of the government you would be enjoined from giving the appearance that the government endorsed or supported a particular religion . 	0
WD	16908	I believe that there has been case law on the matter in which a teacher was dismissed for putting a Bible on the desk . 	0
WD	16909	Carry it in your brief case , but to take it out and place it promenently on the desk every day crosses the line . 	0
WD	16910	My child went to a private all boys school and it was the best thing I ever did ! 	1
WD	16911	As a teacher , this is a moral and ethical struggle for me . 	0
WD	16912	In public school , the parents nor the teachers have too much say in the government run institutions ! 	0
WD	16913	I don ' t know if I agree that a parent has to be super organized , so much as motivated . 	0
WD	16914	( though organization does help . ) 	0
WD	16915	This is why I work to support my family rather than work to support a random group of my fellow human beings . 	0
WD	16916	Ergo , if I have kids that I love and I live in a place with a crappy school district , you ' re damn right I ' m going to put them in a private school if I ' m able to do it . 	1
WD	16917	I ' m not going to ship them off to some crappy public just so I can use them as a tool for making a sociopolitical point . 	0
WD	16918	When preparing for a test , the boys may go for a run , or engage in some other activity , while the girls are more likely to do calming exercises , such as yoga . ” 	0
WD	16919	The writer is an idiot . 	0
WD	16920	As a responsible , rational , moral human being , I have a hierarchy of responsibility . 	0
WD	16921	I have a responsibility to my society but I also have a responsibility to my family . 	0
WD	16922	My responsibility to my family trumps my responsibility to society . 	0
WD	16923	I ’ m not saying it ’ s a good thing that I got a lame education . 	0
WD	16924	I think that as a parent you really have to commit to x amount of hours a day HAVE to be designated for school , and it is really easy to be like " Well , we ' ll get back on track tomorrow . " 	0
WD	16925	Girls thrive on team projects and collaboration ; boys on bright lights , loud voices , and competition . 	0
WD	16926	I ’ m saying that I survived it , and so will your child , who must endure having no AP calculus so that in 25 years there will be AP calculus for all . 	0
WD	16927	This year it may be homeschool . 	1
WD	16928	Isn ' t this an interesting country we live in when we have to justify practicing our religious freedoms ! 	0
WD	16929	In a study conducted by Dr . Michael Mitchell , traits for successful socialization in students include popularity among peers , aggressive competitiveness , pride and self-confidence , and a drive toward materialism . 	0
WD	16930	A second point to consider is that there is an obvious discrepancy between public school educators and homeschoolers on what traits define successful socialization . 	0
WD	16931	It ’ s amazing how much more emotionally mature a six year old is . 	0
WD	16932	With this in mind I feel it does no harm to wait till he ’ s six . 	1
WD	16933	You son sounds like he ’ s much more ready intelligence wise but not emotionally wise . 	0
WD	16934	He wasn ’ t ready for kindergarten though . 	0
WD	16935	I know my oldest was and it ’ s just now in the fourth grade that he ’ s really catching up to his peers . 	0
WD	16936	He sounds like he ’ s mostly ready , but like you said he would be one of the youngest in his class . 	0
WD	16937	I think you really have to know your own child . 	0
WD	16938	As I stated earlier , mainstream was the right move for me , however I do not regret my time spent in The Court . 	0
WD	16939	To my mind , this is not an issue with a quick fix solution , nor are there any definitive answers on what ’ s better for disabled children . 	0
WD	16940	This means that teachers can spend more time on each pupil , answering any questions or concerns they may have about the tasks set . 	0
WD	16941	In contrast , homeschoolers want their children to focus on building character and integrity , developing a sense of responsibility , and respect toward others – ideals of Christian living . 	0
WD	16942	So I would argue that all provision for disabled pupils ( and students ) needs defending whether its special schools , SEN ( special education needs ) departments in mainstream schools or learning support assistants . 	0
WD	16943	To that end , the ‘ integration vs . segregation ’ argument simply becomes an argument that is abstract and separate from reality . 	0
WD	16944	I feel that it is almost certain that ‘ special ’ education will always be necessary for some school-students and ultimately it is their needs which should form the focus of this debate . 	0
WD	16945	It provided me with the first steps in my education . 	0
WD	16946	I hope disabled people , carers , teachers and parents can consider this possibility the next time this debate arises . 	0
WD	16947	The drift toward private schools was predicted as far back at the mid 1980s when I first became a teacher . 	0
WD	16948	At public it ' s payment in full at private it ' s payment in full or pay the difference . 	0
WD	16949	It was said that a ' voucher system ' would eventually be put in place , where by the funding attached to each student would ' travel ' with the student . 	0
WD	16950	Not surprisingly , delinquent and antisocial behaviors are practically non-existent in homeschooled children . 	0
WD	16951	This meant that the public school funding would be dependent upon demand from the community . 	0
WD	16952	" If he ' s older , he won ' t be easily manipulated into drug use and malpractices like this . 	0
WD	16953	As a publicly educated teacher I was concerned about the genesis of ' schools of last resort ' . 	0
WD	16954	He might feel more confident dealing with older students , " she said . 	0
WD	16955	Just as Gibb made a choice depending on her son ' s emotional needs , Vela recommends that parents do the same . 	0
WD	16956	I don ' t necessarily think that social skills or academics should be a sole deciding factor when figuring out when to start school . 	0
WD	16957	If she was down one grade it wouldn ' t make much difference socially since she is SO far off , but she would be further ahead with academics , totally bored , and would have other issues there as a result . 	0
WD	16958	She is a 13 year-old 8th grader with a fall birthday who is at or above level academically . 	0
WD	16959	If my oldest was in the grade where she fits SOCIALLY she would be in 3rd or 4th . 	0
WD	16960	You will also always have someone at the top and at the bottom when it comes to academics . 	0
WD	16961	It doesn ' t matter what the cut-off date is , there will always be someone who falls into each of those categories whether they are one and the same or not . 	0
WD	16962	Someone always has to be the youngest and someone always has to be the most immature . 	0
WD	16963	Tracy Gibb , a mother , blogger of Less than Perfect , deliberately redshirted her son because she thought he was emotionally immature . 	0
WD	16964	My wife and I also wanted our daughter to receive an education in Christ and that ' s a big reason we sent her to Christian private school . 	0
WD	16965	I often spent 20 mins of each year 9 lesson getting the boys to stop aggravating the ADHD boy , as he would then " blow " , much to the amusement of everyone . 	0
WD	16966	Certain schools by us have opened the doors to ESL , and now every lowlife transfers to the great school and destroys the curriculum at that school . 	0
WD	16967	" When he complains about his friend , I always try to remind him that he is one year younger than him and that he was doing the same things last year , " Gibb told ABCNews . com . 	0
WD	16968	Gibb still thinks she made the right choice not only because her son was " emotionally immature , " but also because she did not want him to join high school or college at a very young age . 	0
WD	16969	GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE EDUCATION PROCESS . 	0
WD	16970	YOU WANT TO FIX THE PATHETIC PUBLIC SCHOOLS . . . . 	0
WD	16971	I guess I choose to be a bad person and go with private schooling . 	1
WD	16972	So lets see I have a choice of sending my kids to a private school ; or better yet of homeschooling them and raising intelligent indivuals who can think for themselves and make intelligent decisions when they become adults or I can send them to public schools and play a role in raising more federal libtard zombies who question nothing and can carry on the torch of the last two generations of people destroying this once great country . 	0
WD	16973	The hell with do they know how to read , write , etc . The question is do you agree with the homosexual agenda , do you 5th graders know how to put on a condom , Christianity is evil but don ' t hurt the sweet people of Isam ' s feeling because after all they are part of the religion of peace . 	0
WD	16974	Should I send my kids to school where they can learn NOT how to READ , WRITE , SPELL , do MATH , SCIENCE , HISTORY , but learn how to think the way the Liberal federal government wants them too . 	0
WD	16975	Lets see here . 	0
WD	16976	Hmmm . . . . 	0
WD	16977	there ' s no social advantage at all ; the best place to learn to be social with kids of all ages is a school ! 	0
WD	16978	there ' s no academic advantage to keeping your kid out of school for an extra year , if all you do is put them in some kind of kiddie college , or if you won ' t or can ' t teach them on your own . 	0
WD	16979	all this pressure i see on other kids , and where ' s the benefit ? 	0
WD	16980	she takes one dance class , 45 minutes every saturday , because she asked if she could , not because i think it ' s good for much of anything ; she likes to dance and maybe she ' ll learn to not be such a clod . 	0
WD	16981	i am in the somewhat , these days , enviable position of being a stay at home mom , and i am a nerdy book worm , so it ' s easy enough for me to fill her time at home with education , and in such a way that she doesn ' t think she ' s being taught , ha ha sneaky mom . 	0
WD	16982	what DO you do , if you hold them back that first year ? 	0
WD	16983	the flip side is the parents who HAVE to put their kids in day care and pre-school , because they both work , and how many of them really find that their kids are SO much better off when they finally start school ? 	0
WD	16984	how many of the redshirted kids have parents who can do that , as opposed to paying for extracurricular programs ? 	0
WD	16985	but , no , i don ' t see it . if you want your kid to just be a kid , DON ' T put them in all these activities , unless they ASK to do them . 	0
WD	16986	i have not found one study that shows any tangible benefit to redshirting , and yes , i have looked , because it made no sense to me when i first heard of it , but i thought maybe there was some validity to the idea just the same . 	0
WD	16987	But , say a classmate has died . 	0
WD	16988	If the government actually spent money on the school system instead of other things that would be different . 	0
WD	16989	If prayer really works , then students might turn to God and come to know His love and forgiveness . 	0
WD	16990	Alliance Defending Freedom stands with See You at the Pole and with every student who desires to call upon the name of God . 	0

WD	16992	If prayer didn ’ t work , then a group of students gathering around a flagpole early in the morning to talk to God would pose no threat . 	0
WD	16993	If prayer didn ’ t work , then FFRF would not find it “ unfortunate ” that students are encouraged to “ reach out to [ their ] classmates who do not know God ’ s love and forgiveness . ” 	0
WD	16994	In 2006 , then Education Secretary Margaret Spellings eased federal regulations on the policy , allowing schools to offer single-sex classrooms and schools so as long as these options are completely voluntary . 	0
WD	16995	If prayer really works , then it is a threat to those who would seek to corrupt a generation of students into embracing a godless worldview . 	0

WD	16998	To FFRF and groups like it , the threat of prayer at school is the “ then . ” 	0
WD	16999	The threat is that when students pray , then God responds . 	0
WD	17000	The say and decisions are directed by leader of the system who reports to the state education system . . . not to parents . 	0
WD	17001	As such this leaves little room for parental suggestion let alone parental say in the class . 	0
WD	17002	This is where money talks , if you want to make a change or have a say in your child ' s education this will take either you teaching them yourself or paying someone else to teach them the way you believe is best ( private school ) . 	1
WD	17003	The author assumes parents can change a public system . 	0
WD	17004	The flaw . 	0

WD	17021	As with any generalization , there are exceptions to the rule , but this is what I have seen . 	0
WD	17022	First , students with learning disabilities tend to be self conscious of the fact that they have a learning disability . 	0
WD	17023	There are , however , special education students with more severe disabilities who do stay in a different classroom , but those students are few and far between . 	0
WD	17024	Nowadays , special education students are in regular education classes along with everyone else . 	0
WD	17025	Things have changed tremendously since then . 	0
WD	17026	When I was in high school , special education students had their own wing in the school and mostly stayed there for all of their classes . 	0
WD	17027	Here is my experience . 	0
WD	17028	There can be , however , a few road blocks for special education students , parents and teachers . 	0
WD	17029	I have had several of them in my math classes , and they have generally been some of the best students . 	0
WD	17030	I think mainstreaming special education students is wonderful . 	1

WD	17060	Each choice , regardless of your opinion on homeschool or public school , should be respected . 	0
WD	17061	No one knows their child like them and the entire debate of homeschool versus public school is moot , except between mom and dad . 	0
WD	17062	That angle is in choosing what it best for my child this year . 	1
WD	17063	One thing is for sure . 	0
WD	17064	Next year it may be public school . 	1
WD	17065	What are the factors you considered when making this decision for your child ? 	0
WD	17066	I plan to see how that age assortment goes for him as it may mirror what we will encounter in kindergarten . 	0
WD	17067	This coming year of preschool instead of being in a traditional 3 ′ s classroom , he will be in a young 4 ′ s room that ranges from 3 1 / 2 to 4 1 / 2 . 	0
WD	17068	Taken together , the risk of Leo becoming bored outweighs any concerns I have about him socially . 	0
WD	17069	In some ways being surrounded by older kids is much easier because they tend to be more prosocial and they model social skills from which Leo can benefit . 	0
WD	17070	But , at this point he keeps up well with friends who are a year or more older , and prefers their company to kids who are a few months younger . 	0
WD	17071	Socially , I do wonder if being older would be helpful for him , especially since in adolescence it is socially advantageous for boys to hit puberty early ( it is risk factor for girls ) because that means physical strength . 	0
WD	17072	After his first day of preschool he was disappointed because “ I didn ’ t learn anything . ” 	0
WD	17073	I think he is a kid who is in danger of getting bored in a less stimulating / demanding environment . 	0

WD	17085	Rather than taking on the challenge of addressing existing problems in a failing system run by overworked and pressured staff , Ed Balls is making a scapegoat of those who have chosen to work outside of that system , and blame them for noticing the government ' s educational failings . 	0
WD	17086	The reason for this is that kids and teens are getting their “ socialization education ” from other adults and their peers , without the guidance of their parents . 	0
WD	17087	Lastly , it is important to mention that these same negative values in public school are what is causing the increase in delinquent behavior , including drug abuse , sexual promiscuity , violence , emotional and psychological disorders , just to name a few . 	0

WD	17090	*** The real solution to improve the education system is , give every family with kids a voucher . 	0
WD	17091	The voucher can be surrendered at both private and public school . 	0
WD	17092	For that under privileged family it ' s a blessing , but for my family it was sad . 	0
WD	17093	The solution should have been fix the shxt school rather then wreck the good one . 	0
WD	17094	Some teachers get tenured and then stop trying to educate since they are now " retirement safe " this prevents a lot of the new graduates from obtaining a teaching carrier and replacing the dead wood . 	0

WD	17099	The topic quickly changed to kindergarten entrance , which was charged with palatable anxiety over whether their child should start this coming year or wait a year . 	0

WD	17112	When they do , they never know if they will ever see their child alive again , or have their child ' s innocence stolen from them , or have their child ' s future altered and scared forever . 	0
WD	17113	Most Parents want to send their kids to private schools . 	0
WD	17114	We exchanged basic information about each other , you know , where we live , how many kids we have , what we do for a living . 	0
WD	17115	Academics ? 	0
WD	17116	The school systems cannot afford to suspend or expel children . 	0
WD	17117	Emotional Security Bullying , peer pressure , teasing , competitive feelings are real issues that can mar the experience of a regular school for a child . 	0
WD	17118	Particularly for parents of only children , these issues often take nightmarish proportions ( and probably rightly so ) considering the deep care and protectiveness they offer their child . 	0
WD	17119	The principle seems straightforward – through registration , all home-educated children would become visible to the authorities , who could then protect them – and ensure that the education being received is adequate . 	0
WD	17120	If you want children to pray at school , there are plenty of Catholic and other private schools available . 	0
WD	17121	This is because they want the children to know , there is a price for acting up . 	0
WD	17122	I have seen in the public system , where a principal would give candy to the children that act up , to not do it again . 	0
WD	17123	It ' s ironic to me that the folks most likely to kvetch about all those worthless teachers and teachers unions are the ones who will then turn around and demand those teachers should be able to lead their students in prayer . 	0
WD	17124	Let me say , as a parent and as a Christian , I don ' t want my daughter ' s teacher or her principal or her classmates leading her in prayer in school — including what someone else might consider " good Christian prayer " or else some watered-down pablum generic invocation . 	1
WD	17125	That ' s why we go to church on Sundays , not the local middle school cafeteria . 	0

WD	17133	In a matter of moments , five students were gunned down . 	0
WD	17134	As someone who went to a same sex school for 8 years , I found it lacked the diversity you get in a co-ed environment . 	0
WD	17135	Parent-Teacher conferences were set for Thursday . 	0

WD	17142	Gunfire . 	0
WD	17143	There is a time and a place for everything , including religion . 	0
WD	17144	I am not sure if this is already the case , but I believe that it would serve the State well to treat homeschooling as a type of private school and require that they meet the same standards as those registered facilities . 	0
WD	17145	I am involved as a parent , why is it that we have religion in Jails but not in the public school system . 	0
WD	17146	There ' s no doubt boys behave a little different when girls are watching , and i also found boys were quite good at limiting the bitchyness girls are renowned for . 	0
WD	17147	Some parents may see this as an invasion of their privacy and an intrusion , but the State has a responsibility to ensure that all children living in this country are properly educated . 	0
WD	17148	So both kept one another in line , and made for a more positive and dynamic environment . 	0
WD	17149	I also think there ' s a few extra life lessons and skills children can learn at co ed schools . 	0
WD	17150	Public schools have kicked prayer and Christ out and now their working on the pledge of allegiance . 	0
WD	17151	Really I ' m bad because I want my daughter to know Christ . 	0
WD	17152	Dating , relationships , interacting with the opposite sex , i think children at co ed schools tend to have a far better grasp of these skills then students who ' ve only attended same sex schools . 	0
WD	17153	So what makes your average mom or dad think they can do my job with no degree and no experience ? 	0
WD	17154	The unpleasant fact is that parents who want to abuse children have ample opportunity wherever their children ' s education is taking place . 	0
WD	17155	Public School is not the place for religion , unless we are doing a Comparative Religions course , in which all views are examined . 	1
WD	17156	Parents today can shell out some cash and skip the " Reform Period " by going private . 	0
WD	17157	I was a product of the public school system , and yes , they are very necessary . 	0
WD	17158	Secondly , banning school prayer can in no way be seen as somehow rejecting or abandoning the alleged divine protection that schools would otherwise enjoy , as such theological criticisms always seem to intend to imply . 	0
WD	17159	That in itself clearly does not transform schools into “ God-free zones ” ; banning schools from leading prayers , like banning schools from teaching religious doctrines such as creationism or posting religious rules such as the Ten Commandments , merely ensures that public schools remain religiously neutral environments , for students of every religion or no religion . 	0
WD	17160	For proof of this , all one need do is to recall the 2006 shooting spree which occurred in an Amish school in Pennsylvania . 	0
WD	17161	Officially implementing mandatory school prayers in no way offers a divine guarantee against school shootings from occurring . 	0
WD	17162	And this tragedy occurred despite the fact that community-based Amish schools ( which are not public schools ) conduct morning Bible readings and daily prayers . 	0
WD	17163	Or you could stop being so selfish to the child and send it out into the world so it can learn the importance of society and how to ineract with it . . . an education is often only useful if you know how to work with people using it . 	0
WD	17164	I ' m sure you are , but there are plenty that aren ' t . 	0
WD	17165	what like making sure you are fit to teach a child responsibly . . 	0
WD	17166	The girls in my year just had entirely different interests . 	0
WD	17167	In terms of results ; I really think it ' s mostly up to the individual and how driven they are , coupled together with a good teacher , as to whether or not they do well . 	0
WD	17168	Most of the people I have spoken to who have attended an all-girls school would have chosen to go co-ed had they been given another chance . 	0
WD	17169	I myself went to a co-ed , and am so glad I was able to – I only had a few close female friends , because I was way more comfortable hanging out with the boys – I just preferred playing sport during breaks than gossiping about what happened over the weekend . 	0
WD	17170	But there is also a case to be made for parents who wish to home-school their children . 	1
WD	17171	We in Barbados think of homeschooling as an activity that occurs only in North American countries or perhaps further afield , and cannot imagine why in a country that offers free education to all school aged children , a parent would want to take on the responsibility of teaching their child . 	0
WD	17172	The curriculum is much more hands on and students learn more . 	0
WD	17173	I am all for the public school system . 	1
WD	17174	It is a question I used to ask myself some years ago , until I recognised that the school environment of today is much more explosive than it was just a few decades ago . 	0
WD	17175	I would respectfully recommend you actually take the time to learn about home-schooling before posting such ignorant and hateful words but alas , the products of a liberal and intolerant educational system cannot possibly fathom such a possibility . 	0
WD	17176	Ah yes , the shining examples of the ignorance of home-schooling is well displayed in the majority of these posts . 	0
WD	17177	A second reason I deplore single sex schools is that girls and women are shortchanged as far as math and science are concerned . 	0
WD	17178	This is a skill that is not learned in a single sex environment . 	0
WD	17179	In order to get along in adult society most occupations require that their practitioners get along with both men and women . 	0
WD	17180	They learn to regard members of the opposite sex as people . 	0
WD	17181	In a coed school children deal with each other as individuals . 	0
WD	17182	It will no doubt require that officials of the Ministry of Education create measures to guide parents opting to go this route , and by extension require them to visit these homes to observe what is being done . 	0
WD	17183	One thing that I hope all people learn in school is to get along with other people . 	0
WD	17184	I regard single sex education as bad . 	1
WD	17185	“ It ’ s the isolation that allows it to exist . " 	0
WD	17186	One friend of mine , a product of a girl ' s high school , had to take remedial courses so that she could satisfactorily take college level science course . 	0
WD	17187	My observations of women who were products of girls schools is that they do not have the same preparation that women who are products of coed schools do . 	0
WD	17188	So if we add Friday to the weekend , then Muslims can go to the mosque on Friday , and not have to choose between going to school , or going to worship . 	0
WD	17189	It ’ s simple ! 	0
WD	17190	Now , there are pros and cons for each . 	0
WD	17191	But I feel that the co-ed school is more " natural " and its pros outweigh its cons more than the all-girls school . 	0
WD	17192	Otherwise , any discussion of religion should be strictly technical . 	0
WD	17193	I switched to an all-girls school in the 10th grade and stayed until I finished high school . 	0
WD	17194	First of all , those of us who send our children to private schools are also paying for the public schools at the same time through our property taxes . 	0
WD	17195	I can not tell you how many times I have come across teachers with over inflated egos . 	0
WD	17196	Schools are not always bad because of funding etc . Sometimes they are un areas that are mismanaged or just have bad teachers . 	0
WD	17197	Good schools draw good students regardless of a private or public classification . 	0
WD	17198	They think they are a parent and saving the world of their students , when really they are incapable of passing on any amount of knowledge . 	0
WD	17199	But there ' s always going to be a difference of maturity between different individuals , whether male or female . 	0
WD	17200	My father continues to deny my condition to this day and like many disabled children in mainstream schools I was bullied . 	0
WD	17201	Girls are more mature than boys generally , yes . 	0
WD	17202	And personally , I was always more mature than most of the other girls , too . 	0
WD	17203	Since you can no longer pray at school or discuss God , I choose to raise my child with my beliefs and send her to a private school . 	1
WD	17204	Ask your daughters what they would prefer . . . Btw , I work at a co-ed school at the moment and the kids there get on just fine . 	0
WD	17205	Her year went really well too . 	0
WD	17206	And on and on . 	0
WD	17207	Girls do calming exercises ; boys run . 	0
WD	17208	It has a way of sharpening the mind . 	0
WD	17209	That ’ s likely to be good for all of us , regardless of gender . 	0
WD	17210	Hearing yourself say some of this gobbledygook aloud to your kids , though ? 	0
WD	17211	It is closer to the ' real world ' that way . 	0
WD	17212	I went to an all boys school – Can ' t say I particularly liked it , I would of much preferred gone to a co-ed . 	1
WD	17213	They will be more at ease around the opposite sex when they are older and it just makes sense . 	0
WD	17214	Kids should grow up in the company of both sexes . . . 	0
WD	17215	We were the worst in 12 years and were beaten by LOTS of co-ed and public schools . . . 	0
WD	17216	If it is purely education you are concerned about ( and not so much behaviour ) , our year ( at a private school ) went shockingly bad in OP scores . 	0
WD	17217	In saying that my sister really enjoyed going to an all girls school . 	0
WD	17218	So you can never tell . 	0
WD	17219	We are making this sacrifice for him because this is what is best for him . 	0
WD	17220	I would make the same sacrifice for my daughter but she is doing just fine where she is now . 	0
WD	17221	We are making it work and I can tell you , that I have seen a 100% difference in him . 	0
WD	17222	He is relaxed and eager to do well and so excited that his largest class has 14 kids . 	0
WD	17223	At the end of the day this is a very personal choice that each family has to make for their child individually . 	0
WD	17224	Some view much of what as taught as " secularism . " 	0
WD	17225	But none of this is praying to Darwin , or claiming him , or anything , a deity . 	0
WD	17226	This is a sticky subject . 	0
WD	17227	Some think of evolution as teaching atheism . 	0
WD	17228	If they wish to raise their children as atheists , that is their right no matter what anyone thinks . 	0
WD	17229	So therefore they must put up with the school forcing a faith , no matter how shallow , on them ? 	0
WD	17230	Please look forif you ' re interested . 	0
WD	17231	A good question here is how much does this cut into a parent ' s right to raise their children . 	0
WD	17232	Wow . 	0

WD	17247	I feel my education was a perfect balance . 	0
WD	17248	The whole issue is just another example of a populace that has fallen into a big ditch , dug by those who despise authority ( Nobody tells me what to do ) , see plots and loss of freedom in every shadow , behind every bush , and in anything that will require them to think before they vote . 	0

WD	17257	It ' s important to remember too that private schools are neither required to hire certified teachers nor administer state tests . 	0
WD	17258	They also have wide latitude in deciding which students to admit and which to push out . 	0
WD	17259	The national average of public schools is pulled down by the number of such schools serving poor students . 	0
WD	17260	If these schools were eliminated , schools in the affluent suburbs would hold their own against the best private schools . 	0
WD	17261	But achievement is higher because students in private schools come from more affluent families than students in public schools , rather than because of better practices . 	0
WD	17262	This distinction is crucial . 	0
WD	17263	Using data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study , Sarah and Christopher Lubienski , professors at the University of Illinois , found that when controlling for demographic factors , public schools are doing a better job academically than private schools . 	0

WD	17272	Neither of us knows much about private education from personal experience , however both of us have met privately-schooled people at university and through work . 	0
WD	17273	These people have spoken about opportunities , like sport and music programs , that had not been available to us as public students , and the extra resources available at the private schools because there was more money available . 	0
WD	17274	The media is full of reports on the lack of funding for public education , and the number of teachers compared with students in the public system means classes are bigger than we ’ d like . 	0
WD	17275	But for a complete , general education do private schools offer the range of subjects , experiences and environment public schools do ? 	0
WD	17276	From my school experience , public schools offered more diversity socially , spiritually and ethnically , so I think it provided a more realistic view of the world I would face after school . 	0
WD	17277	If officials at your school have questions about the event , share our letter with them . 	0

WD	17284	Full disclosure : my wife and I homeschooled our four children through eighth grade , and then used a mixture of private Christian high school and additional homeschooling throughout their high school years . 	0
WD	17285	But that ’ s not what drives this for me . 	0
WD	17286	And want one more fact that may surprise you ? 	0
WD	17287	Homeschooled children do not lag behind public school children overall in communication and socialization skills . 	0
WD	17288	Homeschooled children ’ s tests scores were not significantly affected by their parents ’ household incomes or whether their parents were certified teachers . 	0
WD	17289	Homeschooled children perform better overall in college — from their freshman years to their senior years . 	0
WD	17290	So why am I such an advocate ? 	0
WD	17291	Because homeschooling is what lets you guard and protect your child ’ s heart and optimally mold their character in a dark and fallen world . 	0

WD	17295	The BS they half-arsedly try to teach us ? 	0
WD	17296	Isherwood Yes , that ' s true , but the purpose is to give students time to collect thoughts , pray , do homework for the class at hand , etc . Sorry , I can ' t quote the source , but I read some statistics the other day that students who make time each day for some silence ( not necessarily religiously related silence and / or prayer , just silence ) do much better in school because people don ' t realize how much noise dominates our days and inhibits our thought . 	0
WD	17297	I don ' t think 2 minutes of silence could possibly hinder our absolutely terrible public education any further than it ' s current decrepit state . 	0
WD	17298	It ' s all good . 	0
WD	17299	Don ' t worry , I agree . 	0
WD	17300	They are still usually better than parents who have other things to do and who ignore the daily chore of teaching their kids schoolwork . 	0
WD	17301	I attended private school up until age 14 , and I have yet to learn anything from our public ed . system . 	0
WD	17302	True , but the scenario at the top was obviously over-the-top wrong . 	0
WD	17303	His father , Clarence Powell , defends the home-school education that Josh and his 11 siblings have received , and that he has a right to educate his children any way he sees fit without the government interfering . 	0
WD	17304	He eventually took remedial classes at a community college and has since transferred to Georgetown University , but he still has a long way to go in catching up on the years of missed education . 	0
WD	17305	When they declined , he petitioned the school system to let him in , but they declined too . 	0
WD	17306	Powell himself realized how far behind he was falling and had asked his parents to send him to school . 	0
WD	17307	One of his siblings , currently at middle school age , still hasn ' t learned to read . 	0
WD	17308	Powell tells of how his parents , who kept him and his 11 younger siblings out of public schools for religious reasons , failed to provide a basic education that left him far behind other children his age in areas like math , science , history , and English . 	0
WD	17309	The article profiles 21-year-old Josh Powell , the product of home schooling in rural Virginia , who paints an incredibly negative picture of the experience of getting your education at home . 	0
WD	17310	Why do some parents not think their kids can attain ? 	0
WD	17311	No student should be *ASSIGNED* to a single-sex school against his / her will , but I ' m all in favor of voluntary selection into one . 	0
WD	17312	I would much prefer my children attend single-sex high schools to cut down on the distraction factor . 	1
WD	17313	The Powells , of course , are just on case of a home-schooling family , but Josh thinks they are other kids like him . 	0
WD	17314	The example one of them gave was , " My neighbor held back her child , and now she ' s in first grade , and reading at a 4th grade level ! " 	0
WD	17315	Not only that , but far from the crisis in public education that many see , the Lubienskis make a strong case that public school are doing a fine job educating the youth of America . 	0
WD	17316	The results of the study don ’ t surprise me because I live in the real world , and in the real world the best get paid the most . 	0
WD	17317	According to Atlantic , the Lubienskis report that the Educational Testing Service , Stanford and Notre Dame all took a look at the same statistics — datasets they call it — and came to the same conclusions . 	0
WD	17318	The Lubienskis aren ’ t saying that public school students score higher , because test comparisons show that the average private school student scores higher . 	0
WD	17319	But the private school student is likely to be wealthier , come from a stable family , not have a disability and not have suffered early life trauma . 	0
WD	17320	Correct for these factors — in a sense only compare apples that fell from the private school tree with those that fell from the public school tree — and the public school wins hands down . 	0
WD	17321	It doesn ’ t surprise me that somebody figured out how to prove that public schools outperform private schools . 	1
WD	17322	And it doesn ’ t surprise me that this seminal study is being ignored by the mainstream news media . 	0
WD	17323	As of one day after Atlantic released its article reviewing The Public School Advantage : Why Public Schools Outperform Private Schools , a Google search yielded but one article covering the important findings of authors Sarah Theule Lubienski and Christopher A Lubienski . 	0
WD	17324	The Lubienskis took into the account the effects of affluence , disabilities and other background factors and found that then public schools outperformed private schools over the past twenty years . 	0
WD	17325	I don ' t think age really dictates how well you will do in school or in sports . 	0
WD	17326	The only reason most private schools show good numbers is because they can completely ignore all the problem students . 	0
WD	17327	Around here , there are plenty of choices , but the government only pays for public education of various types and those who can afford private schools pay for those above and beyond their property taxes that fund the public schools . 	0
WD	17328	I don ' t see the big deal . 	1
WD	17329	I do what is best for my children and assume other parents do what is best for their children . 	0
WD	17330	Interestingly , it wasn ' t the atheist Madalyn Murray O ' Hair who sued the school district to stop this , it was some Jewish parents , who thought that the prayers said in school would not be considered appropriate for Jewish students to pray . 	0
WD	17331	Let us hope they do not break the broad global consensus on education reform by pursuing ideological distractions that threaten to undermine the right to education . 	0
WD	17332	For many years the DFID has been a global leader in supporting sector-wide public education reform through the Global Partnership for Education . 	0
WD	17333	Lost revenues from tax exemptions given away unnecessarily by governments add up to $138 billion annually- which is more than enough to ensure we deliver on the full education and wider development agenda in every country . 	0
WD	17334	We need to support progressive macro-economic policies over austerity and we urgently need to expand the domestic tax base of low income countries , for example by ending the unnecessary and often corrupt tax holidays given to big multinational companies . 	0
WD	17335	We need to mobilise new resourcing for education , securing at least 6% of GDP and 20% of national budgets . 	0
WD	17336	We desperately need to improve the quality of public schools , and this issue needs concerted attention and support . 	0
WD	17337	Thankfully , most DFID funding for education is still spent on such efforts . 	0
WD	17338	Such investments yield systemic , nation-wide returns in improving quality – a much more strategic and effective use of public money . 	0
WD	17339	Ideological reasons for homeschooling are , in my opinion , completely legitimate . 	0
WD	17340	The public education system has not failed , it ' s got to deal with things that no private school does . 	0
WD	17341	Most private schools are nothing more than religious indoctrination , what difference does it make ? 	0
WD	17342	If you put the same restrictions on the private schools , they ' d be just as bad . 	0
WD	17343	America has experienced radical decline in each of the four areas which the children ’ s prayer touched upon : youth , family , education , national life . 	0
WD	17344	The New York school children which prompted the Engel vs . Vitale ruling had simply prayed : “ Almighty God , we acknowledge our dependence on Thee and beg Thy blessing over us , our parents , our teachers and our nation . ” 	0
WD	17345	The removal of prayer from our schools was a violation of the third commandment which commands us “ not to take the name of the Lord in vain . ” 	0
WD	17346	Minor recovery has occurred only since 1980 when the election of President Reagan brought forth a renewed emphasis on “ traditional ” values . 	0
WD	17347	Consider the following chart compiled from his study , America : To Pray or Not to Pray . 	0
WD	17348	A recent statistical analysis by David Barton graphically illustrates how America has plummeted from righteous living , prosperity and success in the last quarter century . 	0
WD	17349	On June 25 , l962 , 39 million students were forbidden to do what they and their predecessors had been doing since the founding of our nation – publicly calling upon the name of the Lord at the beginning of each school day . 	0
WD	17350	1 As you might have already noticed on Mr . Barton ’ s graph , America ’ s moral decline rapidly accelerated following one event – the U . S . Supreme Court ’ s removal of prayer from our nation ’ s schools . 	0
WD	17351	Worse than taking the Lord ’ s sacred name in vain is treating it with contempt , denying it rightful place and stripping it from public use and even from the lips of children . 	0
WD	17352	By the judicial act of forbidding invocation , the Court audaciously elevated a secularized system of education beyond the authority , reach and blessing of God Himself . 	0
WD	17353	Each school district is different . 	0
WD	17354	Each classroom environment is different . 	0
WD	17355	Each child is an individual . 	0
WD	17356	I continue to monetarily support a broken system that I can not even take advantage the so called benefits of because it does not give my child the adequate tools she will need to be successful in life . 	0
WD	17357	That February birthday excuses me from much of this anxiety . 	0
WD	17358	I think the social aspect of co-education outweighs the potential distractions ; at the end of 6 years , you come out with a study score , but once you have that , I think the memories and friendships you got out of those 6 years become much more important , and I can ' t imagine having as good an experience had I gone to an all-girls school . 	0
WD	17359	While a public school classroom is perfect for your 11-year old Johnnie , it might not be right for 9-year old Susie . 	0
WD	17360	While a particular school district worked well for your kids , perhaps moving to a new school district found them to not be so cooperative . 	0
WD	17361	Given the research on the topic , if you have concerns about your child ’ s behavior and that is why you are considering delaying them , this is important information that may signal your child would benefit from behavioral intervention , if not immediately than it is something to keep in mind as they progress through their early years of schooling . 	0
WD	17362	So what is the answer to the question originally asked of me at that cocktail party ? 	0
WD	17363	What will I do for Leo ? 	0
WD	17364	Well , he will be 5 1 / 2 at the time of kindergarten . 	0
WD	17365	Although I am a big fan of examining the data to inform parenting , the results often do not reveal a clear path , and although group level statistics are useful , they do not tell parents what their individual child ’ s trajectory will be . 	0
WD	17366	What is clear , however , is that given redshirting is much less common than originally thought , parents should worry less about how their child ’ s age will compare to peers ( there is no reason to hold them back just so they won ’ t be much younger than most of their peers ) and more about the signals their own children are giving them . 	0
WD	17367	The big areas to consider are : social skills ( ability to initiate and maintain play , sharing , understanding of own and others ’ emotions ) , academic skills ( knowledge of content areas such as letter / number recognition and phonics ) , ability to regulate impulses ( staying on task , following directions ) , and fine motor skills ( fine motor skills have been linked with academic success above and beyond content knowledge and attentional abilities ) . 	0
WD	17368	Interestingly , teachers rate enthusiasm to learn , ability to follow directions , and attention span as the most important factors for kindergarten success , less so than actual academic knowledge ( which parents tend to perceive as most important ) . 	0
WD	17369	Send your kids to school with their kids . 	0
WD	17370	Do something about it . 	0
WD	17371	Use your connections to power and money and innovation to make your local school—the one you are now sending your child to—better . 	0
WD	17372	Use the energy you have otherwise directed at fighting to get your daughter a slot at the competitive private school to fight for more computers at the public school . 	0
WD	17373	Don ’ t just acknowledge your liberal guilt—listen to it . 	0
WD	17374	Single sex education has been very good for girls , especially . 	1
WD	17375	Look at the women leaders in this country and you will find that they are products of single sex educational institutions . 	0
WD	17376	That would still be a step beyond even what those who complain about secularism are complaining to God . 	0
WD	17377	It is opposed because it represents the antithesis to the beliefs of those who set policy for much of our public school system . 	0
WD	17378	My kids won ' t go to public schools for a lot of reasons . 	0
WD	17379	I in good conscience could not ask anyone else to through good money after bad as you suggest that we all do . 	0
WD	17380	Values can be promoted , in accordance with the client population ' s choice . 	0
WD	17381	Private schools provide an option for respecting religion and expressing it publicly . 	0
WD	17382	Ms Wong is really the bad person here , because she wishes to impose a secularist establishment which cannot bring itself to keeping boys in the boys ' lavatories or allowing even elective religiously supported ethical education to be presented to students . 	0
WD	17383	We are so integrated in our neighborhoods and businesses that there is no chance that divisiveness might be exacerbated by private schools , especially in the contemporary religious environment . 	0
WD	17384	That secularism was the worst feature of Soviet Communism and we know what it led to . 	0
WD	17385	Prayer is an action which proclaims that life is more than saving the environment or accumulating wealth . 	0
WD	17386	If the textbooks contain any reference to God , there ' s trouble , and if the teachers happen to make any kind of a reference to God , or religion . . or the hereafter . . or what ever may have any religious connotation , the children tell their parents and the parents complain ! ! ! ! 	0
WD	17387	Time was , the school day started with a prayer , and yes , maybe religion classes , but not nowadays . . there would be full scale war . 	0
WD	17388	The movement to single-sex education in the US has been framed as a solution to both girls ’ absence from science , technology , engineering , and math disciplines and the perceived decline in boys ’ overall academic success . 	0
WD	17389	However , the data behind these assertions is shaky at best . 	0
WD	17390	Diane Halpern , Professor of Psychology at Claremont McKenna College and former President of the American Psychological Association , wrote a particularly biting review of the pro single-sex education literature . 	0
WD	17391	Perhaps as a result of the pro single-sex education framing , the US has seen an increased interest in single-sex schooling in the last few decades . 	0
WD	17392	More private single-sex schools have emerged and even many public school districts have begun to experiment with single-sex programs or classrooms . 	0
WD	17393	An important question that arises in consideration of public schooling , though , is if separate schooling is actually fair to all students . 	0
WD	17394	Where ever the Muslims go , they expect " special " treatment . 	0
WD	17395	Ohhhh , here we go again ! ! ! ! 	0
WD	17396	In order to keep everyone satisfied , there should be no religion in schools . 	1
WD	17397	No religion in schools . . . . this is what we ' ve come to . 	1
WD	17398	Too bad , if the Muslim children don ' t come back to classes after their prayers . 	0
WD	17399	If parents want their children to have religion , they are going to have to teach them at home or in their places of worship . 	0
WD	17400	For goodness sake , it ' s just awful . 	0
WD	17401	That ' s their problem , not the school ' s . 	0
WD	17402	To this day , I tend to feel uncomfortable around anyone who doesn ' t fit that criteria ( ironically enough , since I ' m a left-winged , pansexual atheist ) . 	0
WD	17403	No one is being forced to participate in the event , nor is it interfering with class time . 	0
WD	17404	Yes , they socialize with other people - but those people are other white , right-winged , heterosexual Christians . 	0
WD	17405	So what is the threat ? 	0
WD	17406	They just don ' t get it . 	0
WD	17407	They just don ' t understand the world . 	0
WD	17408	And , that starts with a high quality , fair education that focuses on techniques that work and teaches all students as individuals , not as stereotypes . 	0
WD	17409	There were not a lot of choices as far as curriculum and very few parents continued to homeschool through high school . 	0
WD	17410	I don ' t think that home schooling is good for children and I don ' t think that single sex schooling is good for children either . 	1
WD	17411	On September 25th , millions of students across the globe will participate in See You at the Pole by joining together before the beginning of the school day to pray for their friends , families , teachers , school , and nations . 	0
WD	17412	Whatever home schooling does for you intellectually , I can ' t think it can have that great an influence on their ability to fit in with other kids . 	0
WD	17413	Prepared to be proved wrong though . . . . 	0
WD	17414	Interesting . 	0
WD	17415	I commend your commitment and I wish you all the best for your sons . 	0
WD	17416	I suspect you will probably do a better job of educating them than most schools would . 	0
WD	17417	I can ' t help wondering , though , what the fallout is likely to be in terms of their ability to socialise with other kids . 	0
WD	17418	What bothers me here is that this appears to have been a group decision . 	0
WD	17419	None of us are perfect . 	0
WD	17420	That said , should the decision have been made by one person I would understand and cut that person some slack . 	0
WD	17421	There are many intricate details when making decisions in regards to drawing the line when separation is required . 	0
WD	17422	But such reasoning is deeply flawed and fallacious on multiple levels . 	0
WD	17423	Firstly , we have not “ kicked God out of our schools . ” 	0
WD	17424	Students can ( and do ) . 	0
WD	17425	In the wake of violent school-related tragedies , such as the recent massacre at a Newtown , Connecticut public elementary school , there is often a wave of heated rhetoric emanating from religious conservatives regarding how perhaps such school shootings might not have occurred if only we had not “ kicked God out of our schools ” by banning state-led school prayer . 	0
WD	17426	So , schools are by no means “ prayer free zones ” — the shrill objections of ultra-conservative Christians committed to the unconstitutional re-introduction of state-sanctioned , teacher-led daily school prayer notwithstanding . 	0
WD	17427	Just because school officials may not lead students in prayers does not mean that students are unable to freely pray on their own , throughout the day , at school . 	0
WD	17428	While acting in their capacity as employees of the state , public school teachers must comply by the constitutional rules that prevent the state from endorsing or promoting religion . 	0
WD	17429	( That also means that public school teachers may not post the Ten Commandments in their classrooms , or teach creationism in science classes , since doing so amounts to just as much of an unconstitutional state endorsement or promotion of religion as does leading students in classroom prayers . ) 	0
WD	17430	That was a hard call because he was pretty shy until high school . 	0
WD	17431	These techniques can vary from room temperature to instruction approaches . 	0
WD	17432	Some educators also suggest that single-sex education can broaden the educational prospects for both the sexes . 	0
WD	17433	When putting these theories into practice , however , experts have asserted that separating students has consequences that extend far beyond the act of learning . 	0
WD	17434	Social , political , and legal concerns come into play when dealing with instituting these policies in public schools . 	0
WD	17435	Proponents of same-sex education argue that a mixed-gender classroom can be distracting for many students , especially at certain ages . 	0
WD	17436	Leonard Sax , founder of the National Association for Single-Sex Public Education , argues that while merely placing boys in separate classrooms from girls accomplishes little , single-sex education enhances student success when teachers use techniques geared toward the gender of their students . 	0
WD	17437	Single-sex education ( teaching males and females in separate classrooms or schools ) is an old approach to instruction that has been gaining new momentum in the education reform era . 	0
WD	17438	Although the practice has long existed in many private schools , it ' s a relatively new option for traditional public schools and charter schools . 	0
WD	17439	Now that over 500 public schools offer some form of single-sex education , experts are renewing the debate over the value of separating boys and girls in the classroom . 	0
WD	17440	According to recent research on the differences between males and females , there are natural differences in how boys and girls approach learning . 	0
WD	17441	I can learn things for myself w / little effort . 	0
WD	17442	But I cannot teach someone else on an educational level , especially since the techniques have changed so much from the way I learned . 	0
WD	17443	My boys have needed help w / their homework at times , and I am honestly dumbfounded at the processes that are used today . 	0
WD	17444	Aside from the fact that I just could not ensure they would get the proper education they deserve for themselves , the only other con that I can see w / homeschooling though is the socialization skills . 	0
WD	17445	I have to say that I admire anyone who has the patience for homeschooling . 	0
WD	17446	I know that I could never do it and make sure that my boys got a good enough education . 	0
WD	17447	Because I ' m a much better " learner " than I am a " teacher " and admittingly I just don ' t have the patience that it requires . 	0
WD	17448	I can teach life skills w / no problem . 	0
WD	17449	I know there are other ways around it , but to me , the best way for kids to learn how to interact w / their own peers is by having the opportunity to learn in an environment that isn ' t necessarily always something interest-based like sports , clubs , playgrounds , etc . but that ' s just me . 	0
WD	17450	I know exactly what is spent per student , the check I just wrote . 	0
WD	17451	They removed me from school because school / teachers were teaching me nothing other than ‘ you are thick so why bother teaching you ’ . 	0
WD	17452	My second son , whom graduated from MIT , received a “ Mathematics and Verbal Talent Search Award from The John Hopkins University in 1995 ; when we attended the ceremony we observed that most of the recipients of the awards were home-schooling students and had foreign last names . 	0
WD	17453	No everybody can teach and learn at home , and some parents and students cheat at home as well as they do at public schools , and the big problem is that nobody could catch them because the most important thing for many parents in this country is that their children should have as many “ As ” as possible on their resu 	0
WD	17454	From the students I taught that were home-schooling , only one was exceptional brilliant , he got a very high score in the SAT , and he attended the University of Maryland , College Park to study engineering . 	0
WD	17455	Also , I know that I could have home-schooling my children , because I have a very high level of education , but I would not have the patient to do that , and I believe my sons were benefited with a very good education from a very good public high school with excellent teachers in Worcester County in Maryland ; my oldest son is a biologist ( Salisbury University ) with three masters , my second son is a mathematician ( MIT ) , and my third son is a mechanical engineer ( College Park ) . 	0
WD	17456	It isn ’ t the same the influence that a student mind has from several teachers and their way of thinking than from only one parent way of teaching . 	0
WD	17457	My three sons graduated from a very good high school in Worcester County in Maryland , and the three of them attended excellent universities . 	0
WD	17458	( And non of the home schooling families I know did / do that either , so what a silly thing to assume that ' s why families do it ) . 	0
WD	17459	It blows my mind to see a public school student with a cell phone , but the parents can ' t afford a box of Cheerios and a ham sandwich . 	0
WD	17460	My parents knew I was capable of more , that I was intelligent but somehow school weren ’ t willing to see it . 	0
WD	17461	I wasn ’ t me that ‘ couldn ’ t be bothered to learn ’ it was the teachers who couldn ’ t be bothered to teach . 	0
WD	17462	Teachers in private school make a fraction of what teachers make in public schools . 	0
WD	17463	How is it that sending a child to a private school for religious reasons makes a parent , " bad people " ? 	0
WD	17464	Our liberal , anti-Christian government and the small minority of whining atheists have cleansed our public schools of any positive values and moral teaching . 	0
WD	17465	Revisionist historians have changed the textbooks to honor the immoral and eliminate reference to godly individuals and the good contributions that religion and churches have made to our society . 	0
WD	17466	They , instead , use our public schools to promote a liberal agenda and brainwash our children to follow those principles . 	0
WD	17467	And this author thinks we are " bad people " for shielding our children from this garbage and creating well-balanced , healthy minded adults who contribute greatly to help our communities ? 	0
WD	17468	The advantage of private school is simple , my money pays for my daughter to be surrounded by like-minded teachers and parents who all want the same thing for their children , a top notch education . 	0
WD	17469	The teachers and administrators are all held accountable and not beholden to a system that is more concerned with keeping people employed , per student spending and providing free breakfast and lunch . 	0
WD	17470	There are the rare exceptions where homeschooling is great - but for most it is child abuse . 	1
WD	17471	Regular testing should be required and if they fail it ' s back to public school . 	0
WD	17472	I have been known to crunch some granola myself and do not view this as a bad thing . 	0
WD	17473	Actually , after reading the comments , that is about the same percentage as my readers who choose to homeschool . 	0
WD	17474	While homeschooling is becoming more secular , the No . 1 reason ( 36% ) parents give for homeschooling is for religious reasons . 	0
WD	17475	However , one is in college and the other is going to be a junior in high school this fall , so that ship has sailed . 	0
WD	17476	Many parents commented that they can get through their lesson plans in just a few hours as opposed to the six hours of instruction it takes in school . 	0
WD	17477	Actually , I don ’ t remember any teacher I worked with ever saying a negative word about homeschooling . 	0
WD	17478	If you show respect to the teachers , they just might return the favor . 	0
WD	17479	I was rather offended at the teacher bashing . 	0
WD	17480	In a class of 25 this takes some time , but I believe it is a good thing for students to hear the various perspectives and express their views among their peers . 	0
WD	17481	This is because there is no classroom management to deal with , and there are often questions and discussion during lessons . 	0
WD	17482	I don ' t think that the big school model is very effective . 	0
WD	17483	Private through 8th grade then public HS . 	0

WD	17502	If you don ' t want the liberals corrupting your child with issues such as mandatory acceptance of homosexuality , private schools are the only way to go . 	1
WD	17503	There is no education in public schools any more ! 	0
WD	17504	And shaming parents over it is only going to further the divide when it comes to schooling . 	0
WD	17505	It ' s not that I was taught that it was wrong , it was never a topic that was brought up . 	0
WD	17506	Lately I ' ve been thinking more seriously about my single-sex education after devouring Sheryl Sandberg ' s now infamous Lean In . 	0
WD	17507	One of Sandberg ' s bigger points is that a lot of work needs to be done long before women are in careers , graduate school , or even college , in order to teach them how to lean in . 	0
WD	17508	When people find out I ' m the product of eight years of all-girls ' schooling they often ask what the best part of the experience was . 	0
WD	17509	I usually answer , only half-joking , " I rarely had to shave my legs . " 	0
WD	17510	In Lean In Sandberg explains that as a child she used to organize all the neighborhood children and tell them what to do . 	0
WD	17511	But to this day she cringes when her siblings tell this story because : " When a girl tries to lead , she is often labeled bossy . 	0
WD	17512	Given this focus on childhood and adolescence I ' m surprised that all-girls ' schools haven ' t been discussed in the same breath as Sandberg ' s long-term project . 	0
WD	17513	Boys are seldom called bossy because a boy taking the role of a boss does not surprise or offend . " 	0
WD	17514	My professional , adult self certainly understands this sentiment , but my 13-year-old self would have been confused . 	0
WD	17515	But it turns out , she ’ s not the only one with this problem , and , in fact , given the rapid increase in single-sex programs in public schools , it looks like the trouble may only be spreading . 	0
WD	17516	Take a look at the recently-released November 2010 Arkansas Department of Education ’ s Application for School Improvement Grants . 	0
WD	17517	It explains that Jacksonville High School ( JHS ) initiated The Freshman Academy “ to help incoming freshmen who needed extra help with academics and social / emotional needs , ” a laudable goal . 	0
WD	17518	Oh come on . 	0
WD	17519	As a visiting student at Barnard College years ago , I attended the transfer students ’ orientation where each student was asked to explain why she had chosen Barnard . 	0
WD	17520	I ’ ll never forget one woman ’ s response : Well , I went to an all-girls elementary school and an all-girls middle school and an all-girls high school , and when I got to my co-ed college , I didn ’ t know how to function around the boys , so I decided to transfer to Barnard . 	0
WD	17521	Well , that ’ s one solution . 	0
WD	17522	I think I laughed at the time . 	0
WD	17523	Instead of using the program to meet its designated goals , JHS leadership used “ the Academy as a dual gender reassimilation because the students were coming from gender-based feeder schools . 	0
WD	17524	The Academy became a chance for the students to get back together after being separated in the Jacksonville Boys Middle School and the Jacksonville Girls Middle School . ” 	0
WD	17525	These same children go to school where they could be introduced to bullying and drugs , and have their education ruined by undisciplined , uncontrolable , disruptive classmates . 	0
WD	17526	But here ’ s the thing : sending my child to a private school does not exempt me from paying city and state taxes that help fund public schools , nor would I want it to . 	0
WD	17527	In an ideal world , I would be in full support of such ideas but in reality , this issue is far more complex ; embracing children with different requirements and potentials . 	0
WD	17528	I ' m not having third grade kids profile my daughter because she ' s not Mexican . 	0
WD	17529	Here is the response that most stuck with me : “ In our upper-middle-class world , it is hard not to pay for something if you can and you think it will be good for your kid . ” 	0
WD	17530	8 ) How many denominations should it encompass ? 	0
WD	17531	This was a small town in Texas . 	0
WD	17532	7 ) Dowant a fiery southern baptist leading your child in , say , non-Catholic prayers ? 	0
WD	17533	We teach our children how to learn , not merely how to pass tests . 	0
WD	17534	My 8yr-old is already enjoying our sessions with basic physics and chemistry textbooks , books which are generally used at the start of secondary school . 	0
WD	17535	@oommph - here you get to a sensitive subject - modern science contains hardly any proper science , just compare the exam papers from the past decade with those from the 70s and 80s . 	0
WD	17536	You ' re also making the mistake of directly comparing discrete subjects from school with a more broad-based approach used by home educators . 	0
WD	17537	We ' ve even done addition and subtraction exercises on a flight home from a holiday before now , and in a Parliamentary committee room one evening , so you can see we ' re all quite flexible about learning . 	0
WD	17538	Forcing prayer upon them is tantamount to removing their ability to decide for themselves whether they would like to be an atheist or not . 	0
WD	17539	He ' s interested now , so we cover the subject now and he ' ll learn it much quicker because of that interest . 	0
WD	17540	Also consider that school is about 25% efficient , so of the five hours a day of nominal lesson time , you lose a fair bit in disruptions , admin , not understanding ( or not listening to ) the topic and having it explained again , finishing the exercise and waiting while it ' s explained again to someone else , etc . Home education doesn ' t take long holidays like school does , so if you work it out , the 250 useful hours of learning at school during a year is easily matched and exceeded by home educators who are doing low-key , low-pressure teaching all the time . 	0
WD	17541	6 ) Children are impressionable . 	0
WD	17542	10 ) What if a child dissents ? 	0
WD	17543	My 10 year old is in a private school . 	0
WD	17544	This is costly . 	0
WD	17545	9 ) In order for the prayers to be led by someone trained in leading prayers , one would have to hire ministers . 	0
WD	17546	More specifically whether mainstream education or ‘ special ’ education is better for disabled children . 	0
WD	17547	Should there be separate prayers for Mormons , LDS , Muslims , Catholics , and Cult of Cthulhu adherents ? 	0
WD	17548	In terms of fostering an educational environment which feels secure for the child , it is hard to think how the government could be less helpful . 	0
WD	17549	Even if granted , I would have to go through this process on an annual basis and , at any point the LEA could refuse my application and force my child into school . 	0
WD	17550	Its just in public schools they force acceptance almost to a point where it is encouraged . 	0
WD	17551	My six-year-old daughter is educated by me , at home . 	0
WD	17552	The government may implement these recommendations by including them in the Queen ' s speech on 18 November . 	0
WD	17553	This letter was prompted by my concerns about the Badman report , a review into home-education which was submitted in June and immediately accepted by Balls . 	0
WD	17554	Today , I received a copy of a letter that my local MP sent to the education secretary , Ed Balls . 	0
WD	17555	I would also have to apply to my local authority for approval which may , or may not , be granted . 	0
WD	17556	It would be compulsory for me to register with the local authority and a criminal offence for me not to . 	0
WD	17557	Badman ' s recommendations would change what home education means to us – a positive and successful part of our family life – into an ongoing battle with the state . 	0
WD	17558	I am not a home-education evangelist and neither do I have any problem with the concept of school , but I do know that home education works for us . 	1
WD	17559	Consequently , the outcome , far from being one of ‘ liberation ’ , can actually cement oppression , simply because the bigger picture hasn ’ t been considered . 	0
WD	17560	NO ! 	0
WD	17561	From my own experience , I can vouch for the truth of the previous statement . 	0
WD	17562	Many sociologists agree that females are , " unable to perform if they are not at least 50% of a class , they feel pressured by stereotype threat and the potential for gender bias , and so a 100% same-sex class would seem to unlock the potential for all females " ( Campbell 7 ) . 	0
WD	17563	And so , one can argue that a single-sex education can more accurately focus the learning needs of the targeted sex ; but does that secluded sex suffer from the lack of the opposite ? 	0
WD	17564	We must first come to realize that while males and females are not two different species , that are very different when it comes to learning , expression , and overall being . 	0
WD	17565	So , will a single-sex education make you smarter ? 	0
WD	17566	Nonetheless , it has been an on-going , contentious issue for society as to whether a single-sex or co-ed environment provides a superior education . 	0
WD	17567	Contrary to popular belief , the 500 girls that went to my school were not closeted-bible-loving-anti-social-feminists and we did , in fact , socialize with members of the opposite sex . 	0
WD	17568	I spent the last four years of my life in a private , catholic , all girls college preparatory high school and while one may say that I missed out on the standard , social facets of a typical high school experience ; I would argue till death that my all girls high school experience was something I wouldn ' t trade for the world . 	1
WD	17569	I , myself , felt more open and confident to participate in an all girls setting . 	0
WD	17570	I had classmates in high school that flourished in an all-girls setting , by allowing themselves to say and do things they wouldn ' t have done in the company of boys . 	0
WD	17571	Seems a tad delusional to me . 	0
WD	17572	For us , we are having the opposite issue -- we are sending our 4 YO twins to kindergarten early because they are academically , socially and physically ready . 	0
WD	17573	They miss the cut off by three months here , so it ' s been an issue finding a placement for them . 	0
WD	17574	So all this redshirting means that they are likely to have kids who are 2 years older then them in the same class as them by first grade . 	0
WD	17575	But I don ' t bring it up and it ' s " yeah , us too , so how is your dd liking her new music teacher ? " 	0
WD	17576	So this mom is just annoying as Hell - heck , I don ' t think she realizes my kid is too . 	0
WD	17577	I swear if I hear one more time ( and I know I will ) about how advanced her kid is . . . 	0
WD	17578	Everyone . 	0
WD	17579	Each family is unique . 	0
WD	17580	I knew a few kids that it happened to . 	0
WD	17581	The latter point is crucial , as parents who opt to pay have prioritised education in their households and will provide a more supportive home environment – which is a key determinant of educational success . 	0
WD	17582	Even if there was some marginal evidence of an increase in gain of quality , it is questionable as to whether or not this could be retained on a larger scale . 	0
WD	17583	Furthermore , and there is no evidence to suggest that the “ competition effect ” of low-cost private schools helps to aid in the process of put increasing pressure for improvements in the quality of public schools ( in fact , private schools do the opposite , draining and pauperising the public sector ) . 	0
WD	17584	The narrative surrounding the causality of any ( flawed ) claims of difference in learning outcomes tends to relate to teacher attendance and school accountability . 	0
WD	17585	Even private schools that charge the lowest fees will not help extend access to the 57 million children not in school today . 	0
WD	17586	Proponents of low-cost , private schools argue that privatised schools offer a model of higher educational quality ; but it is here that the evidence is highly contested and inconclusive . 	0
WD	17587	Proponents tend to be highly selective in quoting what is often flawed , and superficial research about improved learning outcomes . 	0
WD	17588	The biggest flaw is that most comparative studies fail to control for the socio-economic status of children as well as the self-evident motivation of parents . 	0
WD	17589	I believe in discipline , accountability , and excellence . 	0
WD	17590	After all , I have a Master of Arts in Teaching , I did my time doing internships and student teaching , and I am experienced at teaching in the classroom . 	0
WD	17591	The proponents of privatised education argue that private schools make a difference by ensuring that teachers are in the classroom and that schools are accountable to parents . 	0
WD	17592	If so , the coherent response should be to invest in teachers within the public system : expanding and improving training and support , making school inspectorates work effectively and strengthening school management committees . 	0
WD	17593	These things are not attainable in public schools because the poor teachers and administrators are worried about getting sued by the parents for everything . 	0
WD	17594	It would only be fair , that if we were to bring Christian Protestant prayer back into the schools that we also allow for Catholic prayer , Muslim prayer and yes , even Satanic prayer to have their place within the school system . 	0
WD	17595	At best , it will create a lot of grumpy students who are forced to say something that they don ’ t believe teaching them hypocrisy and that religion is just something you say . 	0
WD	17596	Why would a public school , a school that isn ’ t designated as a specific Christian school , bring back Christian prayer into the schools ? 	0
WD	17597	It made me cringe to know that us Christians were depending on government , school boards and people who don ’ t subscribe to their faith to bring back prayer into the schools . 	0
WD	17598	While I am a Christian , and I follow Jesus , I don ’ t believe that bringing ‘ prayer back into the schools ’ will do anything of value to our school system , our students or our city . 	1
WD	17599	Why would we even expect them too or be disappointed if / when they frown upon it ? 	0
WD	17600	Thanks Mr . Trudeau ; you ' ve laid the goundwork that ' s the cause of making life in Canada a living hell . . . oh heck . . was that a religious inference ! ! ! ! ! ! 	0
WD	17601	So there you have it . . . . yet more proof the multiculturalism doesn ' t work ! ! 	0
WD	17602	With the vast amount of editorials lobbying for prayer to be back in schools I couldn ’ t help but to disagree . 	0
WD	17603	If you think I should say something I ’ m not or take out something I shouldn ’ t say or any other comments . 	0
WD	17604	This may be because the children who parents initially thought were immature and in need of an additional year , where actually exhibiting early symptoms of a larger problem and could have benefited from early intervention . 	0
WD	17605	They pay for it in addition to paying for the public schools in their taxes . 	0
WD	17606	Parents have the right to send their children to private schools . 	1

WD	17611	This number is lowest among low income African American children ( 1% ) , presumably because of the cost to the family to provide another year of childcare , and highest within communities with a mean household income of $100 , 000 or greater ( 7% ) . 	0
WD	17612	Only about 4-5% of kids start kindergarten a year after their birth date allows . 	0
WD	17613	There is no hope there but why should we wait until something is done . 	0
WD	17614	The problem is that Democrat / socialists run most public schools and continue that in higher education which is also failing our children . 	0
WD	17615	We keep hearing that public school is where your kids get their social skills to go into the real world . 	0

WD	17670	Prayer is a frontal attack on the notion that mankind is in autonomous control of his own destiny and an insult to those who believe that friends , possessions , or power can bring meaning or joy . 	0

WD	17672	Jesus ’ own expressed desire , “ Let the little children come to Me , and do not forbid them ” was also violated by these judges , many of whom were raised in Christian homes . 	0

WD	17683	Why ? 	0
WD	17684	The only reason the government cares about public education at all is the control and the potential revenue . 	0
WD	17685	What more proof “ free ” public education has failed , the highest test scores across the nation come from Home school kids . 	0
WD	17686	Once again " free " shows its worth . 	0

WD	17692	The emotion behind her statements threw me off a bit , but since that time I ’ ve been giving this topic a lot of thought , since it is clearly a topic about which many parents are thinking , are feeling strongly , and are looking for direction . 	0

WD	17695	The heroine of Sean Adelman ’ s new Nancy Drew-style children ’ s book series is Sam , a middle-grade girl with Down syndrome . 	0
WD	17696	Some say it benefits all students ; others say it ’ s a cost-cutting trick that denies services . 	0
WD	17697	Some say the practice of mainstreaming students with disabilities in regular classrooms is a controversial subject . 	0
WD	17698	“ Friends must learn to accept one another ’ s limitations and flaws and to complement one another ’ s weaknesses by contributing their strengths , ” Adelman wrote . 	0
WD	17699	In a TEACH magazine article about his new book , Adelman says inclusion of students with disabilities benefits entire student bodies by teaching kids about diversity in the real world and helping them develop empathy . 	0
WD	17700	When I reveal that I am child psychologist to other mothers I often get one of two reactions — heightened interest followed up by stories about their kids and requests for advice , or withdrawal out of fear of judgement . 	0
WD	17701	The things Sam does in the book are based on the abilities of Adelman ’ s own daughter , Dev , who also has Down syndrome . 	0
WD	17702	For me , geometry was a nightmare and there wasn ' t a curriculum that worked for me . 	0
WD	17703	By no means is bullying exclusive to disabled children . 	0

WD	17707	Disabled people need an avenue for effective , direct engagement with such important arguments ; ultimately they are the ones affected . 	0
WD	17708	I myself have experienced both ; I attended The Court Special School until year-two , before moving into mainstream St Monica ’ s and then Whitchurch High School . 	0
WD	17709	Furthermore there is a distinct lack of disabled voices in this debate . 	0
WD	17710	Discussions often become the property of parents , politicians , education ‘ experts ’ or proxy organization ’ s , such as disabled charities . 	0
WD	17711	My journey has not been easy by any means . 	0
WD	17712	Children should be placed in the appropriate grade based on the district guidelines unless there is a documented need to do otherwise . 	1
WD	17713	Personally my move to mainstream education was the best choice as I never really struggled academically ( my disability manifests itself more often on an interpersonal level ) , although this would never have worked for me if I hadn ’ t had provision for my disability , such as a learning support assistant ( LSA ) to help me remain focused . 	1
WD	17714	That said my Asperger ’ s Syndrome is rather mild and what works for me may be totally unsuitable for someone else . 	0
WD	17715	Parents should be able to keep their kids home an extra year if they believe their child isn ' t ready for the classroom environment , but when they enroll they should be put into the 1st grade ( again unless there is a documented delay ) . 	0
WD	17716	Probably from a private school . 	0
WD	17717	I was surprised they could actually calculate that . 	0
WD	17718	So they left the cash on the counter , including tax . 	0

WD	17725	This is not the country of my youth . 	0
WD	17726	That ' s a good thing . 	0
WD	17727	It is the quality of teachers ' training , lessons , and classroom management practices — and not the sex of their students — that determines the quality of learning in their classrooms . 	0
WD	17728	Despite the debate , federal law supports the option of single-sex education in public schools . 	0
WD	17729	Unfortunately , as Josh Powell ' s experience shows , sometimes even parents who want to do the best they can for their children may not succeed . 	0
WD	17730	That is scary for rest of us . 	0
WD	17731	Though the state must respect a parent ' s right to offer an education consistent with their religious beliefs , sometimes maybe a parent needs to respect the expertise of others when it comes to determining what makes a quality education . 	0
WD	17732	Why is it then when in our public schools we can ' t mention or refer to God in any manner ? 	0
WD	17733	These are just a few examples . 	0
WD	17734	When the President gives his State of the Union address , above his head are the words " In God We Trust " . 	0
WD	17735	The inscriptions on the Lincoln Memorial states " this nation under God shall have a new freedom " , At the very top of the Washington monument are the words " praise be to God " , The inscription on the Jefferson Memorial " God who gives us life gives us liberty " . 	0
WD	17736	Look at all the references to God in our nations capital . 	0
WD	17737	This nation was founded " under God " ( the pledge of allegiance ) . 	0
WD	17738	I then send my children to a private school to instill moral behavior and God in their lives . 	0
WD	17739	I do support public schools with my taxes . 	0
WD	17740	If you ’ re a loving parent , the last thing you want to do is create a situation where your children are limited or hindered . ” 	0
WD	17741	A primary purpose of public education is to shape good citizens . 	0
WD	17742	In this fast-track world , it may be hard to believe that play is critical for brain development , but it is . 	0
WD	17743	“ Research shows that play actually leads to improved academic skills . 	0
WD	17744	I have a daughter now , and after an awful lot of thinking and discussing , I feel she , like my sister , is well equipped for school ( emotionally , mentally and academically ) , I feel when she starts in September she will thrive . 	0
WD	17745	I would have failed without a doubt ! 	0
WD	17746	I ’ m dyslexic , at school I could barely read , but after being home schooled my GCSE ’ s were mainly A ’ s and B ’ s and I now have a degree , this would not have been possible at school . 	0
WD	17747	To believe ‘ one size first all ’ is clearly coming from people who have never suffered from learning difficulties themselves , from bullying , from the physically ‘ sick with dread ’ feeling one gets on the Sunday knowing that tomorrow is a school day . 	0
WD	17748	I am one of 4 children , my sister thrived in mainstream school , so my parents let her stay there , my two brothers went to a different school altogether , school for boys with learning difficulties and they thrived in their school . 	0
WD	17749	Parents should have a right to raise their children any way they wish , but when they are failing to provide even the most basic elementary skills and knowledge they are depriving their kids of a chance to succeed in life . 	0
WD	17750	I ’ m sick to death of it ! 	0
WD	17751	Since the age of 10 I ’ ve had to put up with people judging something they don ’ t understand , telling my parents that they ’ re wrong for home schooling me ( even though I could not have been happier ) , they never asked me ( the one being home schooled ) how I felt about it , if they did they still wouldn ' t have listened , they ' ve made their mind up and they are sticking with their inexperienced views . 	0
WD	17752	Gathered around the flagpole of their elementary , middle , and high schools , they will cry out to God for forgiveness , favor , and protection for the coming year . 	0
WD	17753	Yet there are many people and groups , like FFRF , that find the peaceful prayers of this gathering of Christian students to be threatening . 	0
WD	17754	Parents seem to think not : an opinion poll commissioned by the BBC found that 60 per cent of adults do not support the enforcement of the law ( that figure drops for older people , with more than 50 per cent of over-65s believing it should be upheld ) . 	0
WD	17755	As Clarence Powell himself says in the Post article : “ A good education is not an option . 	0
WD	17756	It “ breeds divisiveness and bullying , ” and can even “ build walls between public school students who would otherwise get along . ” 	0
WD	17757	What is this “ spontaneous eruption of religiosity ” that FFRF finds to be so threatening to students at public schools ? 	0
WD	17758	All our children are different so why should we teach them all in the same way / style , surly that ’ s just common sense ? 	0
WD	17759	However , if I were to have another child , who knows , maybe if I feel he / she will benefit from being homeschooled that will most definitely be the road I go down . 	0
WD	17760	I ’ ll state the obvious : some boys do ; some don ’ t . 	0
WD	17761	Agree with Moore that our children are not to be sacrificed for a utopian ideal that is just not going to happen any time soon . 	0
WD	17762	It also says to not use God ' s name in vain . 	0
WD	17763	she is academically ahead of the curve , she is a social butterfly ( which she did NOT get from her wallflower mother ) , she didn ' t suffer for me deciding that i was very capable , tyvm , of teaching her myself , and that " socializing " at the park and the play areas at the mall was fine for learning how to interact with her peers . 	0
WD	17764	she was allowed to " just be a kid " until she started school at 5 , and for every one of the last 4 years she has continued to " just be a kid " . 	0
WD	17765	Having said that , a private education is no guarentee of a job , nor that you will always have that job . . . 	0
WD	17766	I have seen plenty of people being shown the door in the corporate world for being incompetent , lazy . 	0
WD	17767	A few points , the " perceived advantages " were hardly touched on in this article . 	0
WD	17768	I know there are some advantages at private schools , having gone to a woefully basic selective high school . 	1
WD	17769	eg daughter in yr 10 decided not to do a science for yr 11 , i received a call from her academic advisor about this , and how did i feel about the career choices she was shutting the door on . 	0
WD	17770	I really appreciated the call , as it meant someone genuinely cared about her future . 	0
WD	17771	stupid , or getting their hand caught in the till . . . . . the boss does not care where you went to school when it comes to firing for these " crimes " . 	0
WD	17772	I am delighted with the education my kids are getting at a private Catholic school , for the fact that trouble makers are dealt with , resources are good , and it is hard to put into words , but someone is keeping an eye on them all the time . 	0
WD	17773	I am democrat and I vote just like everybody else , but I can see the public school system just isn ' t what it used to be and that ' s why I want to send her to private school . 	0
WD	17774	If we could afford it , I would home school and be done with the system all together . 	0
WD	17775	would this happen in a state school ? 	0
WD	17776	I doubt it , as there are not the funds for a full time academic advisor . 	0
WD	17777	He also couldn ' t seem to learn to read . 	0
WD	17778	In the public school , our son was more well-adjusted with better manners and generally happier , but didn ' t receive appropriate levels of OT and ST . 	0
WD	17779	Our contention all along , no matter where he goes to school , is that everyone consider the whole child - not just the academic gains or his emotional well-being but the totality of our son as a person . 	0
WD	17780	Instead , he was given private placement in a non-public school . 	0
WD	17781	At his year end IEP , we pressed for appropriate services in the public school . 	0
WD	17782	Despite all this , he seemed happy enough with his peers in the special education classroom ; he was a bubbly , outgoing , talkative boy . 	0
WD	17783	They weren ' t actively mean to him - they just gave him a wide berth . 	0
WD	17784	He was invited to 1 birthday party of a non-disabled peer ( God bless that little girl and her parents ! ) but no other classmates with disabilities came and the other children stayed away from my son . 	0
WD	17785	A stark difference is the culture of the non-public school versus the public school . 	0
WD	17786	In the non-public school , while they have more OT and ST and he is making progress academically , he is having behavior problems . 	0
WD	17787	WAKE UP AMERICA , PLEASE ! 	0
WD	17788	Saying a student or a teacher can ' t pray is a OBVIOUS VIOLATION OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ! 	1
WD	17789	" How long will you waiver between two opinions ? " 	0
WD	17790	Either there is Religious Freedom or there is not . 	0
WD	17791	Give me a break ! 	0
WD	17792	Hello , I constantly hear and read the cliches ( no offense ) , " I am not ______ , but I don ' t the ______ should do _______ . " . 	0
WD	17793	It by definition must be NUMERO UNO in all areas of life . 	0
WD	17794	Well , duh , it is this simple : Religion is a structure of beliefs that influence everything you do , think , and say . 	0
WD	17795	Why ? 	0
WD	17796	All or Nothing people , there cannot be middle ground . 	0
WD	17797	In India , for example , low-cost , private schools often pay less than one fifth of a teacher ' s salary . 	0
WD	17798	These low-cost private schools share a common thread in that they extract a profit from the fees received , by either employing teachers who lack training and / or qualifications , or by paying teachers much lower salaries than those earned by teachers in government schools . 	0
WD	17799	UK aid is supposed to be focused on ending extreme poverty and support for low-cost private schools inherently contradicts this ; instead , such schools actually exacerbate inequality . 	0
WD	17800	Typically teachers are given short-term contracts ; they can be hired and fired at the whim of the private provider : this has dangerous systemic effects on the status of teachers and the credibility of the teaching profession . 	0
WD	17801	For parents with four children , living on a dollar a day , paying $8 or more per child per month consumes more than their entire income . 	0
WD	17802	DFID concedes that in India , “ no schools charging below $8 are able to perform well ” . 	0
WD	17803	DFID has found that : “ Evidence does suggest that there are serious equity and choice barriers associated with the growth of low cost private schools ” , yet , it seems that these concerns are not enough to stop new and further DFID investments . 	0
WD	17804	In such contexts , parents may choose to send just one child to the low-cost school ; and usually boys are prioritised , thereby excluding girls and children with disabilities . 	0
WD	17805	Depriving your child of a basic education is a form of child abuse . 	0
WD	17806	It can ruin your child ' s whole life . 	0
WD	17807	Home schooling should be illegal unless the parent can demonstrate that they are providing the same level of education as a public school . 	1
WD	17808	There should be a core national curriculum and testing to ensure children are achieving at least a basic level of education . 	0
WD	17809	In an increasingly complex , global technological society , all people need to have a basic understanding of science , technology and local and global culture , just to be able to function and make informed decisions . 	0
WD	17810	I don ' t see any need for home schooling any child unless the child has special needs or learning difficulties . 	1
WD	17811	If public schools are under-performing , then the public education system needs to be improved . 	0
WD	17812	Public education in the US seems to be a self-perpetuating disaster , with ignorant , uneducated , unqualified people on school boards deciding what children should learn . 	0
WD	17813	No amount of teachers and staff can keep students from throwing up a prayer before class or a test or before they eat lunch . 	0
WD	17814	As a student , i think schools should definately support prayer in schools . 	1
WD	17815	Children who don ' t want to pray don ' t have to , and those who do can have their concentration to do so . 	0
WD	17816	As far as a moment of silence during homeroom , I say why not ? . 	0
WD	17817	I fully understand nonbelievers or nonreligious people who dont pray , but their moment of silence can be used for relaxation or even sleep if they want . 	0
WD	17818	A moment of silence doesnt require students or teachers to pray ; Prayer isnt even mentioned in the words , so why make a big deal of it ? . 	0
WD	17819	Unfortunately , we have millions of kids and not all families have the resources to homeschool . 	0
WD	17820	In many underresourced schools , it ’ s the aggressive PTAs that raise the money for enrichment programs and willful parents who get in the administration ’ s face when a teacher is falling down on the job . 	0
WD	17821	And parents have a lot of power . 	0
WD	17822	If I have kids , I will probably homeschool them , because I think that homeschooling fosters real interest and excitement in issues , compared to the stressful motivators of grades and standardized testing . 	1
WD	17823	I also went to public school in a wealthy area in San Diego . 	0
WD	17824	I went to private school in " the hood " in Los Angeles . 	0
WD	17825	Why ? 	0
WD	17826	Private school wins , no matter where you go . 	1
WD	17827	Granted , this should be taught at home . 	0
WD	17828	Children are taught , not only the mandatory curriculum , but also how to be considerate , disciplined and respectful . 	0
WD	17829	In the future , should I have children , they will without a doubt be enrolled in private schools , K-12 , just as I was . 	0
WD	17830	But if you know that what your child is being taught at school emphasizes what you ' re teaching them at home and they ' re being supervised at all times , and they ' re getting a good education , how does that not make sense ? 	0
WD	17831	No self control at all . 	0
WD	17832	There is widespread complaint among parents that children are tested too young and too often , teaching them only to pass tests so that civil servants can compile ultimately meaningless statistics . 	0
WD	17833	More and more parents are choosing to home educate because the school system fails their children . 	0
WD	17834	Under the new regulations though , they would have the legal right to enter my home and interview my child alone in a room to " check " for signs of abuse , not because of any good reason to suspect abuse is taking place , but simply because I have chosen to home educate . 	0
WD	17835	The education officers who liaise with home-educators are trained teachers , not social workers , and so are not trained in the highly specialised field of child abuse . 	0
WD	17836	He claims that home education is the perfect cover for child abuse , but provides no evidence to support this claim . 	0
WD	17837	My greatest concern about Badman , though , is his suggestion throughout the report that being at home rather than with " professionals " means that the child is at a " greater risk of harm " . 	0
WD	17838	As with so much legislation that the government has managed to get through parliament under the emotive banner of " child welfare " , this proposed legislation peddles the idea that children can only be dealt with by professionals . 	0
WD	17839	This report is a solution without a problem . 	0
WD	17840	No , because what the report implies is that if you send your child to a school , you are less likely to be a child abuser . 	0
WD	17841	Will education officers also be going into schools and taking each child into a room by themselves to " check for signs of abuse " ? 	0
WD	17842	This superintendent was trying every possible way to improve the children ' s education and the union shot it down . 	0
WD	17843	If you can afford to send your kids to a private school or if you can get them into a charter school do it . 	1
WD	17844	I have many resources available to me , my classes meet all the standards to get a high school diploma , and I ' m about to start working on university applications . 	0
WD	17845	This particular evening ’ s crowd , however , fell into the interested camp . 	0
WD	17846	Go on Netflix and watch " Waiting for Superman " . 	0
WD	17847	Quite the eye opener . 	0
WD	17848	It ' s not uncommon for public school teachers to send their own kids to private schools . 	0
WD	17849	Most of the homeschoolers I knew growing up were the stereotypical Christian homeschoolers with strict parents who didn ' t do anything secular or know anything about the real world . 	0
WD	17850	In this documentary the superintendent of schools in Washington DC offered to double teachers salaries if they were willing to give up their tenure and get out of the teacher ' s union . 	0
WD	17851	( Teachers get tenure after only 2 years of teaching which makes it virtually impossible to fire them for any reason . ) 	0
WD	17852	They could choose to stay tenured and keep their salary or give it up and double their salary . 	0
WD	17853	The teacher ' s union refused to allow it to be voted on by the teachers . 	0
WD	17854	One solution to the problem of how to set standards for schools that has grown increasingly popular in the U . S . is the use of private schools . 	0
WD	17855	It ’ s essential . 	0
WD	17856	I graduated and went back and got an MBA . 	0
WD	17857	I have my own opinions on this debate . 	0
WD	17858	The debate points have changed little while both homeschool and public school have changed greatly ! 	0
WD	17859	I hold two bachelor degrees , graduated Magna Cum Laude from a public university , and taught in the public school system . 	0
WD	17860	First , may I point out that I am a product of homeschool . 	0
WD	17861	You basically get one opportunity to do it . 	0
WD	17862	I accidentally unleashed a firestorm debate on Facebook by simply asking for homeschool information from my homeschooling friends . 	0
WD	17863	The debate between homeschool and public school has been taking place for longer than I even know . 	0
WD	17864	Instead of receiving said advice , I started a debate of homeschool versus public school and socialization versus the lack thereof . 	0
WD	17865	When I graduated , state law did not yet allow ( or perhaps had just allowed . 	0
WD	17866	I graduated from homeschool in November of 1994 , a semester early . 	0
WD	17867	Most Americans are in favor of prayer in public school because they realize that there is something to be gained from the open acknowledgement of God ' s existence . 	0
WD	17868	Homeschoolers , on the other hand , frequently extend their everyday classroom in real community settings and interactions . 	0
WD	17869	When my kids got old enough for school , I sent them to private school and they were ready for University work . 	0
WD	17870	Some consider public school to be an artificial setting with students being locked behind school gates characterized by forced silence , age-segregation and school bells . 	0
WD	17871	There is pressure for all our pupils today in school – in fact far too much and too early . 	0
WD	17872	We have become a very narrow exam based factory where the ‘ whole ’ person does not appear to be as important as Maths , English and Verbal Reasoning ! 	0
WD	17873	Everyone needs to be invested in our public schools in order for them to get better . 	0
WD	17874	Ditto , social justice and pastoral care . 	0
WD	17875	I recall two girls at my high school had a parent die . 	0
WD	17876	We were never formally told , we just swept it under the carpet . . . i still feel gulity for never saying " so sad for you , how can I help you now that you mum has died . " 	0
WD	17877	At Private schools , a food roster is started , and kids are told to reach out . . 	0
WD	17878	I know it may see , irrelevant , but people care more . . . for me , this is the perceived advantage of private schooling . 	0
WD	17879	Boys and girls going through their teens together is a far more realistic and healthy arrangement than either single sex girls school or a school where girls join the boys in sixth form . 	0
WD	17880	The teenage years are perhaps the most turbulent we experience and during this period growing up side by side as the norm and mixing with the opposite sex is a powerful and important life skill . 	0
WD	17881	Just learning and knowing how to interact with each other , feeling comfortable , going to parties and just appreciating from a boy ’ s view that girls are not some ‘ alien creature ’ not to be talked to are vital factors in helping children to adapt to society as a whole . 	0
WD	17882	Parents who send their children to private schools do support public schools . 	0
WD	17883	So , how would this work exactly ? 	0
WD	17884	I bet you are going to do everything within your power to make it better . 	0
WD	17885	Your local school stinks and you do send your child there ? 	0

WD	17902	It is estimated that there are currently two million children coming under the homeschooling program . 	0

WD	17904	Advantages Of Homeschooling Your Only Child Many parents of single children toy with the idea of homeschooling their child at least once during their child ’ s tenure at school . 	0

WD	17921	But , hey , my first year as a full time student in college was at 13 , which I ' m not anyore , but i feel like im behind because all of the General facts about things you learn in regular school , I don ' t know . 	0
WD	17922	I think that the superiority over one type of schooling doesn ' t exist . 	0
WD	17923	It all depends on the person . 	0
WD	17924	I went to public school and was in every club , president of some , and also was in the Student Body Presidency . 	0
WD	17925	Public schooling creates lots of oppurtunities to meet large groups of people . 	0
WD	17926	This was good for me because my type of personality is to lead people , though usually through manipulation bargains and other types of persuasion , not because im a strong leader . 	0
WD	17927	At the same time I signed up for homechooling so that I could launch myself into college . 	0
WD	17928	I ' ve never done regular homeschooling though . 	0
WD	17929	So I don ' t have grounds on it . 	0
WD	17930	Honestly , of all the groups of people to be put through " separate but equal , " gender should be the least likely . 	0
WD	17931	Bottom line : Yet again left wingers hate competition and choice and want to force EVERYONE into their failed system ( see also : Obamacare ) . 	0
WD	17932	I ' ve known people who were HS where their parents didn ' t really teach them all that much . 	0
WD	17933	Public schools are not going to change even if you and every other parent went up there and complained everyday because the unions won ' t allow it . 	0
WD	17934	There are still great teachers in the public schools - lets stand behind them . 	0
WD	17935	That finding will no doubt come as a surprise to those who believe private schools are intrinsically superior . 	0
WD	17936	The simple fact is that these students will do well in any education venue . 	0
WD	17937	Instead of keeping these bright and well-behaved students in the public schools as models to other students , private schools take only the best and claim that their system is better since their student body is so much more elite . 	0
WD	17938	Responsible homeschooling families attempt to have open and honest communication , preparing children to deal with situations as they arise . 	0
WD	17939	In fact , homeschooled children are often confident , adept at communicating their point of view and capable of making wise choices and responsible decisions . 	0
WD	17940	It ’ s innate , a brain thing . 	0
WD	17941	But I ’ m that way , as is his dad and his sister . 	0
WD	17942	Students with special needs might benefit too . 	0
WD	17943	However , the flexibility provided by the homeschool lifestyle may allow students to develop expertise in other areas such as nature , travel and culture , or budgeting and home management . 	0
WD	17944	Homeschoolers might not study the same topics as peers ' neighborhood schools . 	0
WD	17945	Limited Breadth of Curriculum Some proponents of formal education are concerned that homeschooled students will not receive the breadth of curriculum that children receive in school . 	0
WD	17946	This argument simply does not stand , as most homeschooling families do not live in isolation . 	0
WD	17947	Sheltering Children vs . Strengthening Families A final argument that often crops is that homeschooled children are not prepared to deal with real-world situations . 	0
WD	17948	Families are able to decide how broad or how channeled a child ' s curriculum should be . 	0
WD	17949	They may not receive services from school-based special education staff , but they can receive individualized education in the areas most relevant to their needs . 	0
WD	17950	With our eldest son turning four next year , my partner and I have started discussing when he will go to school - and where . 	0
WD	17951	The problem is the public schools are running the schools poorly . 	1
WD	17952	The private school parents pay for Public , schools , as well as childless parents pay . 	0
WD	17953	So I don ' t blame those that spend more to send their kids to private schools , 	0
WD	17954	The unions are their main priorty , not the child ' s education . 	0
WD	17955	Also , if I hear one more person talk about the lack of “ socialization ” as a reason not to homeschool , I ’ m going to erupt . 	0
WD	17956	So why would anyone want to take their children out of the dominant public education system of our country and attempt to homeschool them on their own ? 	0
WD	17957	That ’ s easy . 	0
WD	17958	Kids do better academically when homeschooled . 	0
WD	17959	I think everyone who is able should consider homeschooling their child . 	1
WD	17960	However , there are also a number of respected private , or independent , schools within easy driving distance , so this is something else for us to consider when planning for our sons ’ educational needs . 	0
WD	17961	Somebody needs to . 	0
WD	17962	I am sick and tired of reading diatribes against homeschooling from those who have never homeschooled , don ’ t have children , or simply have a bias against the Christian overtones related to homeschooling . 	0
WD	17963	It ' s time to disestablish the Church in this country , as well , and allow children to pick any religion ( or none ) in their own time , without the Government pushing them in any direction . 	1
WD	17964	My husband and I both attended public schools . 	0
WD	17965	We aren ' t interested in whether you like it or not . 	0
WD	17966	So we had to do what was best for our children by finding a school that fit the same values we were trying to instill in our children . 	0
WD	17967	Teachers voted against everything us as parents were trying to accomplish . 	0
WD	17968	Very little changed with all our efforts . 	0
WD	17969	Reality sunk in . 	0
WD	17970	We put all of our effort into making the system better , joined every group , volunteered at the school and all events . 	0
WD	17971	Our family switched back to the charter school after doing exactly what the writer suggested . 	0
WD	17972	I ' ve had my children in parochial school , switched to public and now a charter school . 	0
WD	17973	That says something about our morals or ethics if you will . 	0
WD	17974	Even with aides , a teacher often has to slow down and / or pause the lesson to address certain disruptive behaviors ( saw this in my dcs ' class last year , which had multiple inclusion students , some of whom were non-verbal & had daily tantrums & outbursts ) . 	0
WD	17975	At any rate I do have a point to make . 	0
WD	17976	The fact that it made the news that these two kids were honest is amazing . 	0
WD	17977	The store management even provided them with some sort of reward . 	0
WD	17978	All of this attention and a reward for doing the right thing . 	0
WD	17979	Obviously , I touched a nerve and found out first-hand the extent of the cohesiveness among homeschooling community . 	0
WD	17980	As the elder Powell says , the failure to do so can be incredibly difficult for a child to overcome . 	0
WD	17981	Having those distractions ( not to mention having additonal aides in the room ) can be counterproductive to other students . 	0
WD	17982	People were able to learn social skills long before there were schools . 	0
WD	17983	You don ' t need school for this , since this can be provided by a properly functioning community of friends and relations . 	0
WD	17984	It provides children with the chance to work and play with their peers and promotes the development of social skills and interacting with people outside of the family . " 	0
WD	17985	@ Danot " There ' s a lot more to be learned at school than the syllabus . 	0
WD	17986	Home schooling , on the other hand , promotes independence , especially independence from the state - which is the reason totalitarians hate home schooling so much , and ban it so happily . 	0
WD	17987	What schools actually promote , of course , is not " social skill " but social conformity , social obedience , and social subservience to an unelected " authority " external to the family . 	0
WD	17988	That is the kind of thing that parents are supposed to be teaching their kids not to do . 	0
WD	17989	I highly doubt most bad people as kids are thinking to themselves , “ You know what , when I grow up I don ’ t want to be a fireman , I want to hurt people ” . 	0
WD	17990	Maybe just a bad choice or two has led them down a path that they did not intend to be on . 	0
WD	17991	Hell not all bad people are BAD people . 	0
WD	17992	Not all prisoners are bad people . 	0
WD	17993	Not all religious folks are good people . 	0
WD	17994	Now I understand that there is GOOD and BAD in everything . 	0
WD	17995	You know about 60 % of religious people that I have personally met are hypocrites they preach about this and they preach about that and then once they are done putting on there Sunday best they go home drink a fifth and beat their kids . 	0
WD	17996	Last time I checked you were supposed to let God do that kind of work . 	0
WD	17997	Who do you think that you talking to a non-religious person is going to get them to change or believe what you believe . 	0
WD	17998	I ' m sending them there to learn . 	0
WD	17999	Plus , from my own sports experience , age has little to do with sports once you hit the high school level anyway -- I played Varsity Volleyball and Varsity Track as a freshman ( when I was 14 ) . 	0
WD	18000	She claims it makes a " huge " difference for sports . 	0
WD	18001	Personally , I ' m not sending my kids to school to play sports . 	0
WD	18002	I can certainly understand it if the parents feel the kid isn ' t ready , but what I ' m hearing a lot of in our area is parents ( particularly of boys ) doing it because they feel it will make their kid the " class leader " or the " best " in sports ( which is ridiculous IMHO ) . 	0
WD	18003	One of the girls I went to high school with went redshirted two of her three boys because of the sports issue alone ( apparently , she didn ' t know she had the option with the first one but would have redshirted his too if she had known ) . 	0
WD	18004	In Chicago , Illinois ( USA ) , the school district instituted a policy that required 6 YOs to be placed in 1st grade if their parents held them back from Kindergarten . 	0
WD	18005	Redshirting has become such an issue there that the school district felt they had no choice . 	0
WD	18006	Most of the team was made up of seniors and juniors ( who were 3 to 4 years older than me ) . 	0
WD	18007	And really , how can you as a parent feel proud of your child and feel that he is " better " at sports than his classmates when his classmates are 2 years younger than him . 	0
WD	18008	I ' m on the same page as FedUp . 	0
WD	18009	classroom teacher , who often is not special ed certified , has his / her resources & abilities stretched to try to accommodate the special needs in their class . 	0
WD	18010	It isn ’ t necessarily better to have kindergarten classes full of 6- and 7-year-olds . 	0
WD	18011	( A good example is Hope Academy in Concord , N . C . ) 	0
WD	18012	If you can ’ t do that , take advantage of the growing number of schools that offer a combination of homeschooling and formalized classroom experience . 	0
WD	18013	But because there are few voices out there promoting for it , let me make mine loud and clear . 	0
WD	18014	It ’ s a difficult thing to advocate for what you feel may be the best for a child without unduly demeaning the good being done in other settings . 	0
WD	18015	Not just for the academics , but for their protection . 	0
WD	18016	If you can homeschool your child through at least the middle school years , do . 	1
WD	18017	And that ’ s what your goal should be : parenting your child ’ s inner world . 	0
WD	18018	But even if there was a conflict ( there isn ’ t ) , sports don ’ t outweigh what ’ s best for your child ’ s heart . 	0
WD	18019	I know so many of you strive to bring Christ to bear on that setting . 	0
WD	18020	Please know how much I respect and value the hard work and clear calling present in the life of countless teachers and administrators in the public school system . 	0
WD	18021	Let us require the parents to insure those children learn the same subjects , as their age peers , in public or private schools . 	0
WD	18022	Let us required the children to take standardized tests . 	0
WD	18023	And if you experience any difficulty promoting or participating in the event , contact us . 	0
WD	18024	The bible says to pray in private . 	0
WD	18025	That , within itself , is a major problem : these children do not receive that personal contactt with other children of their own ages . 	0
WD	18026	The majority of home schooled children I have met , and had contact with , are smart and get along well with adults , but have an awful time relating to other children . 	0
WD	18027	Happily , some parents realize this , and have their children participate in other groups , such as church , Scouting , 4H , etc . to get that additional group support , and friendships amongst their peers . 	0
WD	18028	They simply do not learn to interact with their peers , and thus are constrained by that pressure , the rest of their lives . 	0
WD	18029	The parents , described in this article , are doing their children a disservice by refusisng to not only let them , but require them to have that knowledge , required in todays workplace . 	0
WD	18030	This is an important part of education , and goes along with the actual learning skills and knowledge required of todays citizen , in order to further their education , get a job and advance through life . 	0
WD	18031	This state needs to immediately back off on the present rules , and fix the problem . 	0
WD	18032	They have robbed them of the chance to advance in life , and that is child abuse . 	0
WD	18033	We do have a lot of private schools around us , we are starting to look into the cost , as ODD is now 3 we figured we should start looking into it . 	0
WD	18034	Early formal education , adult-led activities , single age classes , each child across the country pretty much studying the same thing , in the same way at the same time irrespective of ability , interest or other opportunities . 	0
WD	18035	Funny I really could care less if people are offended by these things , but I am quite concerned that God might be . 	0
WD	18036	Private schools do not receive money from the federal or state governments , so they have significantly more freedom in the types of courses to offer , the types of teachers they hire , and the requirements for graduation . 	0
WD	18037	If you can afford private school ( even if affording means scrimping and saving , or taking out loans ) , chances are that your spawn will be perfectly fine at a crappy public school . 	0
WD	18038	Inclusion can be successful & rewarding for all involved but it also has drawbacks . 	0
WD	18039	It ' s ironic that it is viewed as anti-christian to not want prayer at school and in public venues , to not want " In God We Trust " on our money , and to not want " One nation under God " in the pledge of allegiance because we really haven ' t earned that claim . 	0
WD	18040	Cut down on the ( misogynistic ) bigotry in the classroom and society and there won ' t be any perceived " need " for single-gender classrooms . 	1
WD	18041	Seriously , our society depends on us interacting with each , at the very least , since we each make up over half the damn species ! 	0
WD	18042	In light of that fact , there are only two reasons why students are enrolled in private schools : 1 ) It is a matter of prestige in order to instill an image of elitism , or 2 ) people have been intentionally misled into believing that private schools are " better " than their public counterparts . 	0
WD	18043	So , my high school diploma is a GED which I passed with flying colors and had my choice of colleges to attend . 	0
WD	18044	There is no partnership between the parents and the teachers and as a result , there is a tendancy for the parents to side ( usually unfairly ) with their kids . 	0
WD	18045	Unless you are actively involved with the ongoing education of your children , helping to shape their character and working with them to develop themselves into positive , constructive members of society , then you will wind up with what we are seeing . 	0
WD	18046	The main problem with public schools is parent participation . 	0
WD	18047	What you see is 10% of the parents being involved and the rest of them expect the school system to take care of their kids . 	0
WD	18048	People do not send their kids so they can associate with rich kids , they send them because they know the expectations are higher and that their kids will have a chance at a better education because of it . 	0
WD	18049	A school system that is struggling , against the odds to somehow , marginally educate our children . 	0
WD	18050	There ' s nothing wrong with private schools . 	1
WD	18051	I know several people who said that they wish their parents had waited a year to send them to kindergarten . 	0
WD	18052	DH was 4 when he started school and was only 17 when he graduated from HS . 	0
WD	18053	He hated that everyone was doing everything a year before he could do it . 	0
WD	18054	He was very good at sports though , even though he was a year younger than anyone else on his team . 	0
WD	18055	I honestly made my decision because I had a choice and I just did not feel right personally about sending my DS to Kindergarten at age 4 . 	0
WD	18056	Last year the cut off was October 9th I believe and this year it has been changed to July 1st . 	0
WD	18057	DS ' s birthday is August 30th . 	0
WD	18058	I did not wait to send DS because I wanted him to have an edge over anyone . 	0
WD	18059	Age has nothing to do with ability and if he were the type who would struggle , he would struggle regardless of when he started school . 	0
WD	18060	I do not compare my children with other people ' s children . 	0
WD	18061	What appears at first glimpse to be good progress might not be , according to psychotherapist Melinda Clayton , who practices in Florida and Colorado . 	0
WD	18062	A study released last August showed that the New York City Department of Education is making good progress toward reforms that will reverse a longstanding practice of segregating special education students in their own classrooms and schools , the New York Times reported . 	0
WD	18063	Ours will be that the State Education system is totally ruined , due to many years of being systematically abused by left-wingers . 	0
WD	18064	I wouldn ' t trust a state school to train a dog , much less raise a child . 	1
WD	18065	Should schools be forcing children to worship anyway ? 	0
WD	18066	I was merely soliciting information from them to add to our decision making process . 	0
WD	18067	For the majority of the children in the school , mainstream would not have been a suitable placement . 	1
WD	18068	Many didn ' t speak at all , had extremely challenging behavior and needed to access the curriculum in a very different way to how they would in a mainstream setting . 	0
WD	18069	As has been mentioned by others it really depends on the child and the resources available . 	0
WD	18070	I am a teacher ( currently SAHM ) and worked in a specialist school for children with severe learning difficulties and ASD . 	0
WD	18071	In some cases , inclusion can work fantastically well . 	1
WD	18072	My school had an inclusion class attached to a local mainstream school . 	0
WD	18073	Their needs can be far better met in a specialist school with specialist teachers and resources . 	0
WD	18074	No offended intended to teachers in mainstream settings-I just think it ' s a lot to ask when they may have a class of 30+ children with completely different needs to consider and limited training in SEN . 	0
WD	18075	The pupils would spend the majority of the time in the inclusion classroom , but spend a few lessons a week in a mainstream class ( with a known teaching assistant ) . 	0
WD	18076	They usually went in for sessions like Art , where the difference in ability is less obvious . 	0
WD	18077	Public school are just as good really , if you find the good ones out of the lot that is - In CT they are recognizable 	1
WD	18078	Every one does not have to pray if you choose not to then that is your choice . 	0
WD	18079	Me being a young teen in school , have witnessed first hand to this and i can truly say that prayer should be allowed in schools . 	1
WD	18080	Not only has it affected the schools it has also affected the homes and the homes and its inhabitants . 	0
WD	18081	I believe that prayer being banned from the public school systems was by far the most uneducated and most of all immoral thing that could have been done . 	1
WD	18082	The United States , a far more religious place than this nation of lost souls , has enshrined that idea in its constitution : the state must not support or endorse any religion , so that people can be free to choose their own without coercion . 	0
WD	18083	But more important than that , imposing a state-sponsored religion is wrong . 	1
WD	18084	Please don ’ t let the ignorance of 10 people ruin a nations well being ! ! ! 	0
WD	18085	Increasingly , girls have been besting boys ’ performance across the board : G . P . A . s , school leadership , graduation rates , college attendance . 	0
WD	18086	No organized prayers or services anywhere on public school board property - FOR ANYONE . 	1
WD	18087	In those cases , children can end up being home-schooled by people who may not have the attitude or aptitude for it . 	0
WD	18088	I went to co-ed schools from kindergarten until the end of 9th grade . 	0
WD	18089	I will have 10 special education students in one class period , and another math teacher with the same class in the same period will have none . 	0
WD	18090	I have ADHD and really struggled with the classroom setting- I had too much energy to stay in my seat , I was making too much noise , I was disturbing the other kids , etc- and because of that I spent virtually all of elementary school on behavior contracts that to this day still fill me with an acute sense of shame . 	0
WD	18091	In middle school , I was severely bullied and isolated . 	0
WD	18092	That led to the development of various mental illnesses in ninth grade , and between that and the ADHD , I couldn ' t handle public school anymore and switched out . 	0
WD	18093	I had some great teachers , I had good grades , and I had a small handful of friends , but ultimately public school did not work for me . 	0
WD	18094	The success of homeschooling depends so much on the student , the parent , and the environment they live in . 	0
WD	18095	I did ten and a half years of public school , and then switched out halfway through ninth grade to homeschool . 	0
WD	18096	I now do online school and I think it works fairly well for me . 	0
WD	18097	Yes , I succeeded in school and was generally an A student , but that was mostly because I ' m naturally intelligent and capable . 	0
WD	18098	Yes , I face social barriers now , but honestly I ' m just as awkward as I was in public school . 	0
WD	18099	I have trouble with self motivation sometimes , and take lots of breaks , but I always get all of my schoolwork done . 	0
WD	18100	And the same goes for any child in any school , as any teacher will tell you . 	0
WD	18101	Frankly , the difference is in the parenting and input , not in the method of education . 	0
WD	18102	Homeschooling is not something I have a problem with . 	1
WD	18103	Same with the daughter . 	0
WD	18104	If he likes it , he ' ll stay , if he doesn ' t like it , he ' ll stay and i ' ll work with the school to sort the problems , if he still doesn ' t get on , i ' ll homeschool . 	0
WD	18105	As a secondary teacher who is currently a SAHM with two kids under 4 , I ' ve applied for my sons ' primary place next year . 	0
WD	18106	60 % of them were homeschooled badly , were not up to speed , had evidently not done much mixing , and the kids themselves struggled to fit in at all for the first few years and did not do as well academically . 	0
WD	18107	They went on to do very well . 	0
WD	18108	40% of them were fantastic and had obviously had superb parenting and a grounded education with lots of input from a variety of educators and people . 	0
WD	18109	However , I have taughth some children who have been homeschooled up to Secondary level . 	0
WD	18110	St . Clair high school would once again have both good and bad consequences because boys would most likely do better because of the presence of girls , but girls would most likely do worse . 	0
WD	18111	If De La Salle had teachers capable of punishing students and keeping the boys on track while in school , then it would most likely be a benefit , if the staff lacks the ability to control the boys , it would be bad . 	0
WD	18112	It breaks my heart when I hear about other teachers ridiculing these students in class or dismissing their needs . 	0
WD	18113	I do know one family over-sheltered homeschoolers who fit the stereotypes ; and I know some AWESOME , WONDERFUL people who go to public school . 	0
WD	18114	Healthy , wonderful people can come out of any education ; same for unhealthy people . 	0
WD	18115	There are such things as homeschool groups , and we get together just for the purpose of socializing . 	0
WD	18116	I have so many AMAZING friends now from homeschool events . 	0
WD	18117	There are exceptions to this , but this is true for the MAJORITY of homeschoolers : you get healthier socialization ! 	0
WD	18118	5 . ) 	0
WD	18119	I could go on forever , but I won ' t . 	0
WD	18120	So those are my main points . 	0
WD	18121	I would think it weird to talk to someone in another grade back at school , but I have friends I can honestly call BFFs ranging from age 11-23 . 	0
WD	18122	Plus , you ' re exposed to a wider age range when you ' re homeschooled . 	0
WD	18123	I can also see how child abusers could use home-schooling as part of their evil plans . 	0
WD	18124	The debate around single sex versus co-educational ( co-ed ) will always be a controversial one . 	0
WD	18125	That ' s nice I suppose . 	0
WD	18126	Everyone interested in education will have their opinion and although data would indicate that single sex girls ’ schools might produce the best results , it would seem to be that there is more to this debate than just academic results . 	0
WD	18127	This is the reality of public education today . 	0
WD	18128	I have experience working in all boys ’ schools and co-eds and although I have not worked in a single sex girls ’ school , I strongly believe that the most important factor in all this is the school itself . 	0
WD	18129	I have a december baby and a may baby — my dec son went to kdg at almost 6 b / c of a sept cutoff and my may son went to kdg at slightly over 5 … . 	0
WD	18130	I didn ’ t debate and didn ’ t lament – - I did what the cutoff suggested AND guess what ? 	0
WD	18131	Around third grade , everything evens out and I see it with all the kids – they are all doing what they are supposed to be doing when I look at both my sons and the rest of their classes . 	0
WD	18132	While history suggests boys are stronger at Maths and Science and girls are more linguistic , I believe this gender divide can be bridged by an educational framework which is inspiring and uses a range of teaching strategies . 	0
WD	18133	I totally agree that this segment was driven by helicopter parents . 	0
WD	18134	We must say that our kids are doing what they should be doing b / c they are who they are and not say things like performing at the top and exceeding this or that because IMO – we just propel the argument . 	0
WD	18135	I did like what they speculated in the segment about what will be with all these kids as adults – I am so curious ! 	0
WD	18136	RB 	0
WD	18137	I have seen this first hand as both a teacher and through lesson observations , as the Headteacher of North Bridge House School , it is the more social dynamic side to fully integrated co-eds that I believe to be so important . 	0
WD	18138	The issue of home schooling is one that always seems to spark a fierce debate , and a story published yesterday by the Washington Post is only likely to add fuel to the fire . 	0
WD	18139	Play , which is really a child ’ s ‘ work , ’ contributes to cognitive , physical , social , and emotional growth . 	0
WD	18140	Christian , Jewish , Muslim , Hindu , Sikh , Buddhist , Jedi , Star Trek , etc . . . 	0
WD	18141	The father doesn ' t appear very well educated since he doesn ' t seem to have steady employment other than being a handyman of some sort . 	0
WD	18142	No religious activities in schools . 	1
WD	18143	If there ' s a demand for single-sex schools , those should be an option available to families . 	0
WD	18144	The best way to respect all religions is to show favoritism to none . 	0
WD	18145	“ Standardized tests and other pressures have changed the trajectory of elementary education . 	0
WD	18146	It is a totally deteriorated system , it needs to be torn down and start over with the same kind of private education that made this country great in the first place . 	0
WD	18147	Too many liberals who have been indoctrinated by public universities that have no standards of right and wrong or decent and immoral . 	0
WD	18148	Tried hard to change the public system . 	0
WD	18149	That ’ s the practice of not starting a child in kindergarten until after his or her sixth birthday . 	0
WD	18150	A 60 Minutes segment this week focused on “ redshirting . ” 	0
WD	18151	The segment has generated a lot of conversation both online and in neighborhoods and preschools . 	0
WD	18152	It isn ’ t because of school-district rules , but is something that parents do to give their child an advantage from kindergarten and beyond . 	0
WD	18153	As the mom of a boy with an August birthday and a September 1 cutoff in our school system , I was torn about the potential advantages of an extra year of preschool . 	0
WD	18154	Including the one my kids attend . 	0
WD	18155	I had the opportunity to discuss this issue with Ann Densmore , EdD , an expert in language and social communication skills in children and co-author of Your Successful Preschooler . 	0
WD	18156	( My husband was not . ) 	0
WD	18157	And believe me it has been an adjustment . 	0
WD	18158	Not just the private to public adjustment but also day care . 	0
WD	18159	The only reason why we decided to take out daughter of private school this year is because of the price . 	0
WD	18160	Up until now we were able to afford it , but with my long commute everyday and gas prices and all other prices not coming down we had to make a very difficult decision . 	0
WD	18161	Not only is the learning environment better and more organized so are the teaching practices . 	0
WD	18162	In the private setting she is not being taught how to pass a test so that the school can remain accredited or whatever she is being taught how to think and organize her ideas , and she is actually graded , and not passed along if she can just get by . 	0
WD	18163	Wow ! ! ! 	0
WD	18164	If I have the choice and the opportunity to do so I will gladly put her back in private scholl without hesitation . 	1
WD	18165	He likes it and seems excited by the prospect of being a big kid in school . 	0
WD	18166	* He knows a lot of the kids who will start kindergarten with him ( thanks to preschool ) . 	0
WD	18167	I like the fact that she is being challenged by her school work and even being pushed to begin learning at least a grade level higher . 	0
WD	18168	* He is familiar with the elementary school , a benefit of having an older sibling . 	0
WD	18169	For example , Ryan recently tried to help a friend at school and the friend ( politely , kindly , rightfully ) declined Ryan ’ s help . 	0
WD	18170	Ryan ’ s feelings were hurt so he hit his friend . 	0
WD	18171	The question mark is his maturity . 	0
WD	18172	He can be impulsive . 	0
WD	18173	Girls like reading ; boys don ’ t . 	0
WD	18174	Not just lip-service investment , or property tax investment , but real flesh-and-blood-offspring investment . 	0
WD	18175	I think my view differs from my gal pals because I was able to leave and see the other side . 	0
WD	18176	She reiterated the fact that it all does depend on the person . 	0
WD	18177	And his wife appears to be so cowed she doesn ' t speak for herself . 	0
WD	18178	Often , those who do well academically / behaviorally are often left on their own unless a parent continually advocates for their dcs in order to ensure that things are done to help them reach their full potential . 	0
WD	18179	As wonderful as it is that students want to help take care of the inclusion students , calming down another student means that the child doing that is taking time away from his / her own learning , not the mention the initial distraction that the outburst created . 	0
WD	18180	The primary responsibility of the education of a child rests on the parents . 	0
WD	18181	This puts a tremendous amount of pressure on me , as I want to help all of my students , but can ' t provide the one-on-one time that my students need during class time . 	0
WD	18182	They went to school with them . 	0
WD	18183	They grew up with them . 	0
WD	18184	The point that I am trying to make here is that special education students already have a learning curve , so to speak , and we as teachers need to do everything we can to assist them . 	0
WD	18185	. 	0
WD	18186	My belief is preschool , kindergarten and even 1st grade should be exciting and fun so kids associate those qualities with learning . 	0
WD	18187	Another thing that I feel parents should be aware of : I personally found that girls who attend all-girls school will go out more to actually meet boys than girls in co-ed schools . 	0
WD	18188	What I mean by this is , girls in co-ed schools will hang out with boys from school ( inside and outside of school ) , yes , but the fact is : they know these boys . 	0
WD	18189	But that ' s just my opinion . 	0
WD	18190	Special education teachers see this and place more students in my classes than in other math teachers ' classes . 	0
WD	18191	I know that seems like such a minor gripe , but trust me , you don ' t want to be surrounded by the bullshit girls can concoct amongst each other when there are no boys to " restrict " certain behaviours . 	0
WD	18192	Whether they can write their names in kindergarten is not the point . 	0
WD	18193	Students can pray all they want together or by themselves , and very few people actually argue against this , at least I think . 	0
WD	18194	Prayer in schools should not be led by a school official ( who is a gov ' t official if we are talking about public schools ) . 	1
WD	18195	I see no reason why kids need to have a school-led prayer , or a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance , for that matter . 	0
WD	18196	If teachers aren ' t willing to step up to the challenge , they shouldn ' t enter the teaching profession in the first place . 	0
WD	18197	Seriously . 	0
WD	18198	But here are my reasons : 1 . ) 	0
WD	18199	As a parent , I support that concept as long as the inclusion doesn ' t come at the expense of the other students in class . 	0
WD	18200	Each of these examples are a bias when there is no balance or equal time given to educate other views in the public schools . 	0
WD	18201	I believe that everyone should be allowed to believe whatever they want to believe and pray to whomever they want to pray . 	0
WD	18202	But what does bug me and what I do feel is unacceptable is when people try to impose they ’ re religious beliefs FORCFULLY on someone else . 	0
WD	18203	Lastly , every person sending their children to private schools will pay for public schools as well through local taxing especially if real estate taxes fund that government system too . 	0
WD	18204	But you must donate so that I can build a better platform to get the word out that I can save people you must help me you must donate and don ’ t forget , don ’ t do this … this and this … or else you will not go anywhere remotely nice when you die . 	0
WD	18205	You know this sort of thing gets to me when people think that they are right about they ’ re religion or topics . 	0
WD	18206	Ignorance is truly bliss . 	0
WD	18207	Now in lieu of that last statement I am not saying that I am right in anyway shape or form . 	0
WD	18208	People are always afraid . 	0
WD	18209	Always thinking of death and what could or won ’ t happen next . 	0
WD	18210	Now if your scared enough and all of a sudden in what seems like coincidence , someone comes up to you and says hey you know what . 	0
WD	18211	I can save you I can save you from what ’ s to come . 	0
WD	18212	If a student wishes to silently pray during my class , I do not have a problem with it . 	1
WD	18213	I ' m a teacher . 	0
WD	18214	I also don ' t think teachers / administrators leading prayers over the intercom or whatever are acceptable . 	1
WD	18215	Sandy 	0
WD	18216	He admonished his followers : “ Always beware of vowing , it is a risky thing . 	0
WD	18217	So why did we make all of the necessary sacrifices and send our four children through the private sector ? 	0
WD	18218	It ' s individuals like that who take away the right to choose and assuming it ' s just rich people who send their kids shows the ignorance in that statement . 	0
WD	18219	So , I guess we are bad parents because we put our faith in God first and foremost . 	0
WD	18220	The “ evangelical prophet , ” Oswald Chambers ( 1874 – 1917 ) , saw that the empty promises made by so many Christians actually result in great “ spiritual leakage . ” 	0
WD	18221	I agree that this article is a crock ! 	0
WD	18222	My wife and I are both school teachers . 	0
WD	18223	I worked in the public system , and she worked in the Catholic school system in our area . 	0
WD	18224	In fact many middle class and even lower income folks use private education for their children . 	0
WD	18225	If you can ' t manage that then enroll your children in an alternative school . . . it really is that simple . 	0
WD	18226	It also bids the argument that religion plays a roll and it ' s an obvious attack against those schools who are affiliated that way . 	0
WD	18227	The public school system is secular , keep your religious beliefs at home . 	1
WD	18228	Why not use public schools here are a couple reasons they teach liberal sex education , they teach evolution , they teach homosexuality generally at an early age , and some even hold classes about certain religions . 	0
WD	18229	How long until Muslim schools girls are told to stop exposing their face in school ? 	0
WD	18230	Do you have a better idea ? 	0
WD	18231	Use the comment field below to voice your opinion . 	0
WD	18232	I see benefit to both sides of the argument . 	0
WD	18233	I just don ' t know what the best option is . 	0
WD	18234	SO while the lower performing student has an aid , that high performing student is bored to tears and on a behavioral rampage . 	0
WD	18235	My daughter was 4 when she started kindergarten , turned 5 in late Sept . She thrived socially , but was definitely " middle of the pack " academically till the end of 2nd grade , when something kicked in , and she started caring more about doing well in school . 	0
WD	18236	Yes everyone can stand review but at a point you lose students . 	0
WD	18237	The students can opt out of their accomodations , and they do to save face , further , they are not only hurting themselves , but others in the calss . 	0
WD	18238	The resources teacher ( their aid ) can ' t sit by there side and give them the help and attention they need due to confidentiality . 	0
WD	18239	We have gotten away from this " tracking " mentality , but really , the majority or resource kids I see are no better off . 	0
WD	18240	I have 32 kids in one class and an on level class is mixed beyond belief . 	0
WD	18241	I can attest to the idea that things even out by 3rd grade . 	0
WD	18242	Few children can rise above the poor education of a public school and that is why most of our leaders attended private schools and why they send their children to private schools also . 	0
WD	18243	My kids both have nice professional jobs . 	0
WD	18244	I pay my school taxes but public schools don ' t want my input , just my money . 	0
WD	18245	I just disagree that if public schools went away , all these wonderful educational facilities would magically spring up and everyone would be educated and the world would be a better place to be . 	0
WD	18246	You will never , ever regret it . 	0
WD	18247	Nor will your child . 	0
WD	18248	If you can ’ t do that , explore the many good private Christian schools that are available . 	0
WD	18249	But please , consider doing something . 	0
WD	18250	Pressure to prepare kids for these tests starts as early as kindergarten . 	0
WD	18251	Later , as a parent , I changed direction and became worried about the behaviour that impeded learning and teaching in public schools- behaviour that I witnessed first hand . 	0
WD	18252	Consequently I chose to move my own children from public to private . 	0
WD	18253	I own up to being part of the problem of the weakening of the public system . 	0
WD	18254	I couldn ' t abide that my own values of respect , cooperation and high expectations were not being held for my children in the public system . 	0
WD	18255	The teachers in both systems are the same , but the expectations of the parents are simply different . 	0
WD	18256	I want for my children what my parents did not have to pay for ! 	0
WD	18257	If you have the ability to send your children to private school and choose not to , then it is clear that you love money more than your children . 	0
WD	18258	I helped paint classrooms and wash windows . 	0
WD	18259	Would a moment of silence be out of order ? 	0
WD	18260	This is absolutely the worst piece of garbage I have ever read ! 	0
WD	18261	We did without so we could send our kids to Catholic school . 	0
WD	18262	Why can ' t we have a moment of silence ? 	0
WD	18263	If public school parents don ' t like their ' crappy ' school then let THEM make changes . 	0
WD	18264	Other parents did landscaping , waxed floors , supervised recess , helped in the kitchen , repaired the furnace and water heater , maintained the school bus , and re-sealed the driveway . 	0
WD	18265	This is the way it has always been done in the Catholic school system . 	0
WD	18266	We have done our share . 	0
WD	18267	Where will that child be best prepared to succeed in college and beyond ? 	0
WD	18268	Like most certified teachers I did not hold this method of education in very high regard . 	0
WD	18269	If you wish to improve public schools the only answer is to get government out of education and turn it back to local control . 	0
WD	18270	, specifically my bias against homeschooling before doing the research . 	0
WD	18271	What is wrong with this country is public schools and people that believe that someone owes them something . 	1
WD	18272	This is not about real " choice " . 	0
WD	18273	When middle-class parents go private , they are supporting a shift that will see public schools become a residual system for the poor . 	0
WD	18274	I find it deeply offensive when parents imply that they send their kids to private schools because they care about them more . 	0
WD	18275	There ' s plenty of evidence to show that the best thing you can do for your kids is engage with them ( ie . more time at home , less time at work ) and make their home life an enriching one . 	0
WD	18276	How well a child does at school depends on the child itself not the school it goes to . 	0
WD	18277	Attitude to studies is all important . 	0
WD	18278	I send my kids to public schools because I care about them - their links with their diverse local community etc - but also because I care about the kind of culture they live in . 	0
WD	18279	To me , learning to care about and contribute to society as a whole - not just your own personal interests - is the best value a child can inherit . 	0
WD	18280	All of our kids deserve to reach their full potential , regardless of their sex . 	0
WD	18281	I have written more than a hundred articles for this column and this has never happened before . 	0
WD	18282	If a student ' s mind is occupied with sex , drugs and alcohol you can ' t expect good results . 	0
WD	18283	Set high moral standards for your child and encourage the proper attitude to study and life in general and it won ' t matter which school he / she attends . 	0
WD	18284	The next thing I know there are thousands of readers “ recommending ” my article on their Facebook pages . 	0
WD	18285	Then I did the research and found , for the most part , that they are doing a fine job and I said so . 	1
WD	18286	All of us , no matter our religious beliefs , need to pray that the law changes before more smart children are left behind . 	0
WD	18287	That has changed because of immigrants , the world just in general becoming smaller through computers , TV . , and people becoming more independent from their own study and reading . 	0
WD	18288	When I was a kid we learned religion in church , math , reading , history , etc . , in school and at home . 	0
WD	18289	What will Americans do when Arabs wear headscarves , burkas to public school as is happening in Europe ? 	0
WD	18290	Why are some people making it so difficult , demanding that religion be taught also in schools , alongside science ? 	0
WD	18291	We have some problems to face , don ' t we ? 	0
WD	18292	Notice these are only women ' s wear , which creates another gigantic problem of suppression of the female ( Americans think ) . 	0
WD	18293	The entire world has these problems , not just here in America , and we are the guineau pigs . 	0
WD	18294	Now just 38 per cent of Britons , according to a 2005 poll , believe in " a God " of any kind ( a further 40 per cent of people believe in " some sort of spirit or life force " , apparently , showing that the market for new-age waffly nonsense is still going strong ) . 	0
WD	18295	I can ' t remember the exact timeline ) homeschoolers to simply graduate . 	0
WD	18296	Why , because their parents pay for them to be there . 	0
WD	18297	After reading all the comments attached to this article I would like to address some of them : Thank you for your encouragement to homeschool my boys . 	0
WD	18298	In the end I would like to emphasise two things : 1 ) People have suggested that there are pros and cons , and yes , this is obviously true but the implication to some may be that all this ' washes out ' in the end . 	0
WD	18299	This is NOT true . 	0
WD	18300	Any decent school will have various other contacts . 	0
WD	18301	However , more importantly , a rounded upbringing includes children being involved in other extra-curricula activities that allows them all sorts of interactions with a wide variety of people . 	0
WD	18302	Science can be wrong , but by far I ' ll take science over anecdotal evidence . 	0
WD	18303	: ) Single-sex schools do not mean living in a monastry . 	0
WD	18304	Depending on who you speak to , there is also anecdotal evidence that there are significant risks in vaccination babies . 	0
WD	18305	But the science indicates that the risk is almost negligible . 	0
WD	18306	Again , do the research . 	0
WD	18307	Studies clearly establish that single-sex schools are , IN GENERAL , better for educational outcomes than co-ed schools . 	0
WD	18308	But … 	0
WD	18309	And I thought , sure , because she ' s a bright kid who ' s supposed to be in 2nd grade . 	0
WD	18310	But I didn ' t say it . 	0
WD	18311	Many who say money is a factor are simply choosing to spend their resources on other things when they could spend it on freeing up the possibility of homeschooling . 	0
WD	18312	Oooo - I had to bite my tongue to keep from saying almost the same thing , in a similar situation recentl ! . 	0
WD	18313	I have a July ' 07 girl whom I am sending to kindergarten this fall . 	0
WD	18314	I swear if I hear one more time ( and I know I will ) about how advanced her kid is . . . 	0
WD	18315	I ' m just going to say " so why not move her to 3rd grade where she belongs ? " 	0
WD	18316	It went unsaid , but the message I got was that I was not doing the right thing , by sending mine . 	0
WD	18317	Many who say they are not temperamentally suited to homeschooling are using that as a smokescreen when the truth is they are not willing to exercise the patience and submit to the sacrifice needed to homeschool . 	0
WD	18318	I got into a conversation with another mom whose child was the same age , who was holding her daughter back . 	0
WD	18319	She was actually totally cool , said she was still kind of conflicted about her decision , respected others choices , etc . It was the other women there who jumped into our conversation and assured her that she was DEFINITELY doing the right thing , who annoyed me . 	0
WD	18320	My daughter does not let the overcrowded classrooms bother her . 	0
WD	18321	To this day , I believe it may be the most prophetic series I ’ ve ever delivered at Meck . 	0
WD	18322	I do not believe homeschooling is for everyone , nor the mark of whether you are a good parent . 	0
WD	18323	The children in the public system , some , not all , are just waiting to get out at the end of the day . 	0
WD	18324	I know there can be economic barriers to homeschooling . 	0
WD	18325	Only to be more frustrated because there were about 60 kids in the tutoring session who all had questions . 	0
WD	18326	. 	0
WD	18327	At least one child died . 	0
WD	18328	Terrified students huddled in classrooms . 	0
WD	18329	They called 911 . 	0
WD	18330	They texted and tweeted . 	0
WD	18331	Teachers locked doors and implemented emergency procedures . 	0
WD	18332	And at least one teacher chased the gunman out of the school – an act of bravery that possibly saved lives . 	0
WD	18333	As police try to make sense of the senseless , the school superintendent called on people to pray . 	0
WD	18334	It was a wise decision . 	0
WD	18335	But perhaps lost in the chaos is the irony that in American public schools – people are not allowed to pray . 	0
WD	18336	Liberals have successfully banished God from the classroom , replacing Him with the manmade god of secularism . 	0
WD	18337	The kids are coddled , have no responsibility with the school system in this area . 	0
WD	18338	I think it sends the wrong message . 	0
WD	18339	It drives me nuts . 	0
WD	18340	I am in no way " Wealthy " however I chose to send my children to private school that has a religion based background . 	0
WD	18341	After all , there are very few things one can do as a grown-up , short of joining a cloistered religious order , to be exclusively in a single-sex environment . 	0
WD	18342	I can learn and do schoolwork and still have time for loads of other experiences . 	0
WD	18343	They could do this at public schools but do not . 	0
WD	18344	The public school was a joke . 	1
WD	18345	So I think your argument needs a lot more supporting facts . 	0
WD	18346	It ' s a strange hangover from a time when Britain really was a majority Christian country . 	0
WD	18347	Seems to me that you would send your child to private school if you felt you had the means . 	0
WD	18348	Children in the public school systems ARE left behind , bullied , and not challenged enough in their own learning capabilities . 	0
WD	18349	Private teachers have more passion about teaching because they are free to write their own curriculum for each child based on developmental assessments and achievements to where each child is learning at the level they need to be at and not just a class as a whole . 	0
WD	18350	The teachers do not open up a text book and teach every child the same way . 	0
WD	18351	Sending your child to a private school is one of the best things you can do for them . 	1
WD	18352	Oh , but she ’ s gifted ? 	0
WD	18353	This isn ' t the place to argue about Planned Parenthood , but the things they say to children as young as ten are things that shouldn ' t be said without a parent ' s permission . 	0
WD	18354	I went K–12 to a terrible public school . 	0
WD	18355	Well , then , she ’ ll really be fine . 	0
WD	18356	You want the best for your child , but your child doesn ’ t need it . 	0
WD	18357	I understand . 	0
WD	18358	She will have support at home ( that ’ s you ! ) and all the advantages that go along with being a person whose family can pay for and cares about superior education—the exact kind of family that can help your crappy public school become less crappy . 	0
WD	18359	Schools everywhere are failing to crack down on issues like bullying , and failing a lot of other things too . 	0
WD	18360	I ' m on the homeschool side of the debate . 	1
WD	18361	Woahhh , guys , some of this is starting to get a little attack-y . 	0
WD	18362	For the purpose of this argument , I ' m referring to homeschooling as any kind of flexible education : online schools , unschooling , a hodge-podge of curricula from different places , anything . 	0
WD	18363	That said , I don ' t believe it ' s the best in every single case . 	0
WD	18364	There wasn ’ t even soccer . 	0
WD	18365	When I asked her about it , she said , “ I think the absence of boys helped me personally because I was a shy kid , so being with all girls helped me discover myself more easily and become more outgoing without the pressure of trying to impress boys . ” 	0
WD	18366	Some of you with different political backgrounds may disagree , but this is what I believe . 	0
WD	18367	But even beyond that , I see him being very enthusiastic about learning and I want to give him as many opportunities as I can to foster that curiosity . 	0
WD	18368	This involves more than just the memorization of facts . 	0
WD	18369	Even in the story in the original post , I think mainstreaming was a good thing . 	1
WD	18370	Now that this person has graduated from high school , he might not be able to go on and get the types of college degrees that his peers are pursuing but maybe he could be placed in some sort of work program or job training program to help him be as independent as possible . 	0
WD	18371	I agree with what other posters have said . . . it depends on the individual child and how high functioning they are . 	0
WD	18372	If the being in a mainstream classroom is good for them and doesn ' t interfere with other students ability to learn then it is a good thing . 	0
WD	18373	I would NEVER put my child in a public school system if I could place them in a private . 	1
WD	18374	As far as public schools go , WOW are you sure that your child will come home to you tonight ? ? ? ? ? ? 	0
WD	18375	My husband and I ( my parents too ! ) sacrificed a lot to give him this education . 	0

WD	18380	So , come up with a different way to make the public systems in better shape ! 	0
WD	18381	The effect of this ruling is not just to eat away at the sacredness of the name of God , but to eliminate the sacredness and thereby the substance of the oath itself . 	0
WD	18382	Mr . Morley , writing in the Nation ’ s Business September 1961 , pointed out “ the absurdity of having an official administer to others oaths in the sanctity of which he does not himself believe . ” 	0
WD	18383	In other places , it ' s what kids will hear , and I ' m not talking about peers . 	0
WD	18384	While one child may choose an excellent set of friends and role models , another child might migrate toward the trouble makers . 	0
WD	18385	If he ' d stayed in preschool , it would have been another year of being the bad kid who couldn ' t play or socialize properly . 	0

WD	18395	Nobody is being influenced here - Muslim students are simply being given a place to pray . 	1
WD	18396	I see no issue here . 	0
WD	18397	Fact : Muslims pray five times daily , in a way which is not practical in a normal classroom setting . 	0
WD	18398	This is just silliness . 	0
WD	18399	For example , Jehovah ' s Witnesses commonly do not participate in the national anthem , because they only recognize the Kingdom of God . 	0
WD	18400	Fact : we make other appropriate accommodations for other faith groups . 	0
WD	18401	You will soon understand the failings of the public school system . 	0
WD	18402	The idea that I should consider a lower level of achievement for my children so that the public schools MIGHT improve is ridiculous . 	0
WD	18403	When you remove God you invite everything that is wicked to come in and destroy . 	0
WD	18404	I believe the demise of our schools are solely due in part to the removal of prayer in schools . 	1
WD	18405	Removal of prayer in schools is not a violation of the third amendmant . 	0
WD	18406	In a blog for Yahoo ! , Clayton writes that the real motivator behind downsizing special education classrooms by mainstreaming students with disabilities into general education classes is a desire to save money , not an effort to do what ’ s best for students with disabilities . 	0
WD	18407	The removal of prayer may not be the only cause of social ills , but the negative trends are certainly a symptom of the spiritual decline which is at their root . 	0
WD	18408	She always has the best advice , no matter the topic , and was so happy that I inquired about her opinion on the subject of our education . 	0
WD	18409	Overall , she was happy with the all-girls experience , thinking maybe four years would have been a little better than six , but self-discovery was her biggest gain out of the school . 	0
WD	18410	Of course , it all really depends on the person . 	0

WD	18418	The cost for specialized services to children with disabilities far outweighs the cost of mainstreaming them into regular classrooms where they are unlikely to receive the specialized services they need , Clayton wrote . 	0

WD	18420	Slate . com decided to take the helm with a piece by Allison Benedikt called “ If You Send Your Kid to Private School , You Are a Bad Person . ” 	0
WD	18421	We ’ re not even into the article and the judgements are flying . 	0
WD	18422	Or do you homeschool or unschool ? 	0
WD	18423	Regardless of what might work best for your own child and family , there is plenty of public opinion that will tell you that whatever you ’ ve decided is inherently wrong . 	0

WD	18428	This week , many kids , including my own , are headed back to school . 	0

WD	18430	I didn ' t know one person who did drugs at my co-ed high school , or know anyone who had access to drugs . 	0
WD	18431	The girls at my all-girls school got drugs from the boys they knew ( all outside of school , of course , as it was an all-girls school ) . 	0
WD	18432	Whereas girls who go to all-girls schools will hang out with guys from another school ( maybe their " brother " school ) , guys from the train station , the arcade . 	0

WD	18439	Girls LIKE male attention . 	0
WD	18440	A study conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2011 said that starting kindergarten one year late " substantially reduces the probability of repeating the third grade , and meaningfully increases in tenth grade math and reading scores . 	0

WD	18443	You cannot expect to hold up class time and such and force other people of other religions to listen to Christian prayers , Jewish prayers , Hindu , Muslim whatever it is not right to force people who do not share the same feelings about religion as you to sit there and listen to you pray is insensitive to the beliefs of others . 	0
WD	18444	Church may also be a good time for that kind of stuff . 	0
WD	18445	If there was a correct religion and we knew about it then everyone would most likely be it , don ’ t you think . 	0
WD	18446	You cannot be so ignorant to say that your religion no matter what it is , is the correct religion there is no proof that it is the correct one . 	0
WD	18447	Because no one knows what the right one is . 	0
WD	18448	Why are there so many religions in the world . 	0
WD	18449	How many religions have been founded or made off the words of one man . 	0

WD	18453	@ calminthestorm . 	0
WD	18454	I certainly know more than 3 home educated people , non of which went off the rails , yet I could compile a huge list of children that attended school who did . 	0
WD	18455	As for social interacting , I used to go on camping trips , day trips , I would study with friends by rivers , in the woods , on the beach or just pop round to each others houses . 	0
WD	18456	It was such a positive and wonderful experience , my parents travelled far and wide to give me these experiences , for that I will always admire them ! 	0
WD	18457	For the record , my parents aren ’ t hippies , or God fearing Christians . 	0
WD	18458	Also to sate that home educating families are middle class could not be further from the truth , with four children and my father receiving a pitiful wage as a hill farmer and my mum being an unpaied housewife , they , nor I fall into the bizarre and inaccurate stereo type of a home educated family . 	0
WD	18459	To assume parents who home school are ‘ cruel ’ could not be more wrong . 	0
WD	18460	To send a distressed and terrified child to school everyday is sick ! 	0
WD	18461	As supporters of this campaign against public teachers unions , it only makes sense that the news media ignores important books such as The Public School Advantage : Why Public Schools Outperform Private Schools . 	0
WD	18462	Charter schools , vouchers for private schools , school and school district takeovers — virtually all right-wing school reform efforts attack public school teachers because they are unionized and therefore make a decent wage . 	0
WD	18463	Weakening unions is one key strategy in the thirty-year class war in which wealth has been transferred from the middle class and poor up the economic ladder to the wealthy . 	0
WD	18464	The news media will certainly give fair coverage to both sides of most labor disputes , but in feature coverage they give far greater voice to anti-union pundits , writers , politicians , theories and events than to those in support of unions . 	0
WD	18465	The news media , owned as they are by large companies , have come to share big business ’ disdain for unions , especially over the past thirty years . 	0
WD	18466	In the case of education , it ’ s just not so , but the news media filters out this important news for ideological reasons . 	0
WD	18467	One of the ideological tenets of the mass media is that the private sector always outperforms the public sector . 	0
WD	18468	Nor was I surprised that the news media has ignored the Lubienski book . 	0
WD	18469	Are private schools better or worse ? 	0
WD	18470	Should private schools be allowed to compete with public schools ? 	0
WD	18471	However , school vouchers are illegal in most states , so this solution is not available to most parents . 	0
WD	18472	The most common solution to this problem is called a school voucher , which is essentially a tax rebate for parents that they can use to pay private tuition . 	0
WD	18473	What do you think ? 	0
WD	18474	Many polls have indicated that the American public is supportive to the idea of school vouchers , but national teacher ’ s unions oppose them , and so far they have not become a mainstream alternative to public school . 	0
WD	18475	The primary obstacle to creating more private schools is cost . 	0
WD	18476	A private school can choose to create a new curriculum for auto mechanics if it wants to , and doesn ’ t need to ask the government for permission or funding . 	0
WD	18477	Many parents do not have enough money to both pay school taxes and pay for tuition at a private school . 	0
WD	18478	Right now , all citizens of the U . S . pay taxes to maintain their local schools . 	0
WD	18479	We are not number one in any single category . 	0
WD	18480	We are a second rate nation when it comes to education and while were ' at it we aren ' t exactly a shinning example of exemplary medicine either . 	0
WD	18481	All that would accomplish is further reducing the number of properly educated young people . 	0
WD	18482	Look at the world achievement rankings of our young people . 	0
WD	18483	According to a report issued by the National Center for Education Statistics in spring 2011 , the scores for kindergarten entry were higher for delayed-entry kindergartners and on-time kindergartners than for repeating kindergartners . 	0
WD	18484	We find substantial variation in practices across schools , with schools serving larger proportions of white and high-income children having far higher rates of delayed entry , " noted the report , " The Extent , Patterns , and Implications of Kindergarten ' Redshirting , ' " issued in April 2013 . 	0
WD	18485	No thanks . 	0
WD	18486	If you don ' t believe that they are as bad as I think they are , then you need only pay close attention when you ' re in a situation where young people might be talking or better yet when they are at a check out register . 	0
WD	18487	Some parents are even delaying schooling to give their children a competitive advantage in sports , or to delay admission age to college . 	0
WD	18488	Parents might think their child is not emotionally ready to leave home , or not socially or academically adept . 	0

WD	18490	A joint study by the University of Virginia and Stanford University released in 2013 established a relationship between red shirting and socio-economic status and ethnicity . 	0

WD	18496	Truth be told College may not be in his future , but we will do everything in our power to try to get him there . 	0
WD	18497	It not only threatens educational freedom but also places a presumption of guilt on loving families who must prove themselves innocent to suspicious officialdom . 	0
WD	18498	From the home educators ' point of view , however , the conflating of welfare issues with education is a dangerous step . 	0
WD	18499	The real world is not segregated , nor are universities . 	0
WD	18500	We tried to mainstream him in kindergarten , but he had a hard time adjusting . 	0
WD	18501	My child was in " preschool handicapped " from age 2-5 . 	0
WD	18502	lf not , it can backfire on the child . 	0
WD	18503	l think as parents of the child you have to be certain and confident that your child is ready to mainstream . 	0
WD	18504	We took him off meds and we have a strong behavior plan , he sees therapists , and it is hourly teaching and redirecting with him . 	0
WD	18505	Our goal is for him to not have a one on one by middle school . 	0
WD	18506	2 grades later , he still has a one on one aide but doing EXCELLENT . 	0
WD	18507	So the school got him a one on one para and it helped a bit . 	0
WD	18508	I ' ll be putting this view into practise when my daughter is old enough . 	0
WD	18509	Why can ' t we find a situation where he is happy AND can receive an appropriate education and related services ? 	0
WD	18510	The tragic case of Khyra Ishaq prompted Ed Balls to commission a review of home education in 2009 that was undertaken by Graham Badman . 	0
WD	18511	Thankfully , the teacher situation seems to have stabilized . 	0
WD	18512	Yet , they still seem ill-equipped to deal with behavior problems . 	0
WD	18513	The non-public school director has said repeatedly that we are welcome to take our child out of her school since she has a waiting list , whenever we have brought up concerns . 	0
WD	18514	( Our biggest concern was the revolving door that teachers were on in 2006 / 07 : 3 teachers quit in 1 year . ) 	0
WD	18515	The non-public school has a very unwelcome attitude towards parent involvement , and even to questions and concerns that parents may raise . 	0
WD	18516	The idea that child abuse can be thwarted by tightening laws about home education has been around for some time . 	0
WD	18517	It seems that Khyra ' s last hope was that the local authority ' s home education support team might intervene once her mother had withdrawn her from school . 	0
WD	18518	What does that tell ya about are public school system ? 	0
WD	18519	He reached the same conclusions as this week ' s serious case review – that the law be changed to ensure that social services speak to children to assess if home education is in their interests . 	0
WD	18520	My problem is when a parent doesn ' t put the effort in to socialize the kids , they are in too narrow of a group of friends and not allowed any friends out side of that group . 	0
WD	18521	They will take away your rights to homeschool based on the outcome of the testing , I think that ' s a good thing . 	0
WD	18522	I know in this state the kids have to pass a yearly assesment test . 	0

WD	18529	A TA once a week for a severly ADHD boy who became violent was NO GOOD . 	0
WD	18530	A TA once a week in my lessons for an sutistic boy was NO GOOD . 	0
WD	18531	In this age group ( senior high school ) , the benefits were larger and more consistent across the board for girls than for boys . 	0
WD	18532	The National Foundation for Educational Research conducted a study in which they observed and calculated of 2 , 954 high schools ( both co-ed and single-sex ) throughout England and found , " Even after controlling for students ' academic ability and other background factors , both girls and boys did significantly better in single-sex schools than in coed schools . 	0
WD	18533	It is very clear by the above chart that both sexes academically benefit from a single-sex education . 	0
WD	18534	But then we have studies that show the numbers . 	0
WD	18535	Advantages have not been demonstrated . " 	0
WD	18536	That ' s not to say that academic outcomes are definitively worse , but neither are they definitively better . 	0
WD	18537	Penn State ' s very own , psychology professor Lynn S . Liben claims there is no academic benefit to a single-sex education , " Our examination of the existing studies leads us to conclude that there is not scientific evidence for positive effects of single-sex schooling . 	0
WD	18538	So , while the single-sex atmosphere allowed young women at my school to branch out and express themselves without the restriction of the opposite sex , some may argue that it could have instilled an anxiety associated with the opposite sex . 	0
WD	18539	It ' s been proven that the per student cost basis in public schools is much higher than private schools . 	0
WD	18540	For higher-achieving boys , there was no statistically significant effect of school type on performance , positive or negative . " 	0
WD	18541	Specifically , girls at all levels of academic ability did better in single-sex schools than in coed schools ; whereas for boys , the beneficial effect of single-sex schools was significant only for boys at the lower end of the ability scale . 	0
WD	18542	Age wise I was right in the middle of my class at school and I was far ahead of my class . 	0
WD	18543	Yes , out public school system is broken , but until the PARENTS start caring and actively participating in the education of their children and stop making it solely the schools ' job , nothing is going to change . 	0
WD	18544	I remember when I went to public school and it just seemed that the teachers cared about more than their yearly raises and making sure the school got enough money each year from the government . 	0
WD	18545	However I feel that the school struggles to meet her needs due to lack of experience and always fighting for funding . 	0
WD	18546	I ran life skills groups and was always part of any meetings about trips , work experience , careers etc . I now work as a TA with a child with CP who is placed in a mainstream school appropriately so because despite physical and communication difficulties is very bright . 	0
WD	18547	Those with physical disabilitys but no additiona learning needs were fully intergrated into the class but because of the inclusive nature and an excellent senco adaptations could be made , e . g IT provision in every lesson , access to a scribe , extended time to sit exams and submit homework , leaving lessons a few minutes earlier to avoid the crush in the corridors . 	0
WD	18548	They were able to mix with their peers of all abilities at break times . 	0
WD	18549	The kids intergrated into the lessons they were able to and had lessons within the unit . 	0
WD	18550	One secondary school had a great system with a unit attached with a high ratio of TA ' s to children . 	0
WD	18551	I was a paediatric Occupational Therapist and worked in both special needs schools and mainstream environments and saw successes and failiures in both . 	0
WD	18552	I think it must be a mindfield for parents having to make this choice and despair at the battles they face for funding appropriate eductation for their children . 	0
WD	18553	I can see the benefits of both types of schooling for differnt children . 	0
WD	18554	More over , they will probably succeed in their work life no matter the school they attended . 	0
WD	18555	This is what ALL schools should aspire to be . 	0
WD	18556	There are true outliers in both directions based on personality vs when they started school . 	0
WD	18557	The single-sex education question is , at least in part , a legal one , but it is also a scientific one . 	0
WD	18558	The ACLU ’ s findings have led them to challenge the sex-segregated programs in several states and even file a lawsuit against a West Virginia program . 	0
WD	18559	As a result they were , in fact , decidedly unequal . 	0
WD	18560	Many of them relied on outdated and scientifically unfounded stereotypes of boys and girls to drive their curriculum . 	0
WD	18561	But , in the absence of high-quality research , why err on the side of segregation ? 	0
WD	18562	Perhaps if we do a better job of having the scientific conversation about whether or not single-sex education actually works we wouldn ’ t have to have the conversation about the legality . 	0
WD	18563	At the moment we simply don ’ t have sufficient evidence to say that single-sex education in the US actually works . 	0

WD	18567	Additionally , Ryan can have short attention span , especially if he ’ s bored . 	0
WD	18568	( Please , pass me another glass of wine ) . 	0
WD	18569	I worry some about her going off to college at age 17 , but the idea of a gap year at 17 to engage in a rewarding volunteer experience sounds better to me than an extra year spent in preschool would have been . 	0

WD	18571	I ’ ve often wondered – if God is good enough for the bad times , shouldn ’ t He be good enough for the good times ? 	0
WD	18572	Yet in times of great tragedy , school leaders inevitably seek guidance and solace from the same God they ’ ve expelled . 	0
WD	18573	Another issue is Ryan ’ s loudness . 	0

WD	18581	You also find children who are ready to leave home at an even younger age . 	0
WD	18582	A few weeks ago I posted some thoughts on the impact of Title IX beyond collegiate athletics and last week my colleague , Markus Gerke , wrote brilliantly about the myth of the boy crisis in education . 	0
WD	18583	In this post I will illustrate how Title IX proponents and believers in the boy crisis myth have come to clash over the topic of single-sex education . 	0
WD	18584	We need a moral adjustment , not a legislative one . ) 	0
WD	18585	There are a lot of reasons why bad people send their kids to private school . 	0
WD	18586	Everyone , all in . 	0
WD	18587	( By the way : Banning private schools isn ’ t the answer . 	0
WD	18588	None of these are compelling reasons . 	0
WD	18589	Or , rather , the compelling ones ( behavioral or learning issues , wanting a not-subpar school for your child ) are exactly why we should all opt in , not out . 	0
WD	18590	Yes , some do it for prestige or out of loyalty to a long-standing family tradition or because they want their children to eventually work at Slate . 	0
WD	18591	But many others go private for religious reasons , or because their kids have behavioral or learning issues , or simply because the public school in their district is not so hot . 	0
WD	18592	I believe in public education , but my district school really isn ’ t good ! 	0
WD	18593	you might say . 	0
WD	18594	We are also far from rich . 	0

WD	18596	I didn ' t feel equipped to teach him and he got nothing from my lessons , and when he was " blowing " neither did anyone else . 	0
WD	18597	There , I said it . 	0
WD	18598	Every single solitary teacher I ' ve spoken to about this says that any differential based upon age pretty much disappears by the time the child is in 3rd grade . 	0
WD	18599	I can see it right now at the end of second grade - to the extent there were differences because she was so young are completely eliminated . 	0
WD	18600	FWIW - I think for many kids you can tell in kindergarten and first . 	0
WD	18601	But being at the tail end of this , you can ' t tell after that . 	0
WD	18602	So the question is : Why do people hold their kids out a year when the District says this is when the kids go ? 	0
WD	18603	If you really can ' t tell - why don ' t you just follow the rules ? 	0
WD	18604	You honestly cannot tell the difference in the ages of the kids . 	0
WD	18605	Every once in a while a child might stand out but it ' s not that often and the reason they are standing out is usually not because they seem " older " or " younger " I don ' t necessarily disagree with you . 	0
WD	18606	The teacher says she can ' t tell any difference at all . 	0
WD	18607	As the temporary alliance between Liz Sayce and Maria Miller proves , this can make for some very unlikely bedfellows . 	0
WD	18608	BUT teaching in a class of 35 without support was silly . 	0
WD	18609	Preparing special work for the ADHD / Autistic / severely limited children was not a problem , a joy , really , and my job ! 	0
WD	18610	No wonder students who have been divided by sex for years need help learning how to work and learn together . 	0
WD	18611	Here ’ s the bottom line : many of our schools are in trouble and coming out of the largest recession since the 1930s , with mounting national debt , we have limited resources . 	0
WD	18612	Perhaps this outcome isn ’ t surprising . 	0
WD	18613	Social scientists have found that labeling and separating students based on almost any characteristic ( e . g . , sex , eye color , randomly assigned t-shirts ) makes those differences even more salient to the students and produces intergroup bias . 	0
WD	18614	Got that ? 	0
WD	18615	Instead of focusing on techniques that have been proven to improve academic outcomes , the school has to spend its limited resources teaching boys and girls to play well with each other . 	0
WD	18616	So , the right of kids to pray in school is not only not banned , but even constitutionally protected . 	0
WD	18617	In fact , the Bill of Rights ’ First Amendment protects both the right to freedom of speech ( prayer can obviously be a form of speech ) as well as the right to free exercise of religion ( praying also obviously qualifies as exercising one ’ s religion ) . 	0
WD	18618	Kids pray all the time in school ( often right before a quiz or exam ) . 	0
WD	18619	This is nonsense . 	0

WD	18622	Having previously discussed why teaching creationism in public school science classes , or posting the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms , are both inappropriate and unconstitutional , I suppose it ’ s perhaps time now to take a look at the whole heated issue of the place of prayer in U . S . public schools . 	0
WD	18623	Article failed to justify the heading lost the plot along the way . . 	0
WD	18624	However , please note that these constitutionally protected legal rights and freedoms apply only to people , and not to the government . 	0
WD	18625	And , in actual fact , no one is officially disallowing kids to pray in school whenever they want ( so long as it isn ’ t disruptive , of course — a basic school rule that equally applies to other sorts of free speech and forms of self-expression ) . 	0
WD	18626	Today , parents who homeschool don ' t even worry about high school or diplomas . 	0
WD	18627	Still , it seems that should be some oversight to prevent children from falling through the cracks . 	0
WD	18628	Both sides of this debate have a compelling case . 	0
WD	18629	And it is entirely possible that some children might receive a better education at home than they would in any of the available schools they could attend . 	0
WD	18630	Unfortunately , for parents who cannot afford private education , live in certain suburbs or who want to send their children to a public school , the selective system is the only one that will nurture and encourage them to learn and grow amongst peers who want to learn . 	0
WD	18631	Parents should not be judged for trying to do what ' s best for their children . 	0
WD	18632	I also recognize that there are deep roots to explore when we look at who is attending private versus public schools , and it certainly bears looking at why people make those choices , rather than dismissing them as not compelling enough like Benedikt does . 	0
WD	18633	Using Benedikt ’ s rational , if everyone sent their kids to public schools they would somehow magically improve . 	0
WD	18634	And due to cost , location , waiting lists , and other issues , sometimes Catholic school or another private school is not an option ( though home schooling versus Catholic schools has been a whole other debate ) . 	0
WD	18635	Out in the Western suburbs , where we can afford to live , public high schools just won ' t do unless you ' re happy for your kids to be beaten up , spat on , thrown rocks at , and depressed going to a school full of delinquents who swear at teachers & disrupt the class all day . 	0
WD	18636	How can they learn and grow in such a place , even with high involvement and support from home ? 	0
WD	18637	Don ' t need statistics , just need to put your kids into the public school system to know they ' re being disadvantaged through under resourcing and teachers ill-equipped to deal with the policies they are meant to be managing , i . e . bullying , attire , social attitude , etc . The number of parents pulling their kids from the public system speaks for itself in how the public system is operating . 	0
WD	18638	Pulling my kids out of the public system was the best thing we ever did for them ! 	1

WD	18646	However , it should be made clear that coeducation can also foster good mental and emotional situations . 	0
WD	18647	Since private schools compete with each other to gain students , they have a strong incentive to hire good teachers and offer good courses . 	0
WD	18648	For a variety of reasons , boys in a classroom has an overall negative impact on girls ' learning . 	0

WD	18662	At 13 I would have said that of course girls need to be bossy -- who else would lead ? 	0
WD	18663	As far as prayer in school , I think a moment of silence to allow a private prayer of any type for anyone who wishes to give such is most appropiate . 	1
WD	18664	I took this attitude with me into high school , a building that sat next to an all-boys ' school . 	0
WD	18665	Some of my classes were coed . 	0
WD	18666	The boys came over for European history and drama , classes where I always positioned myself in the front row , preferring the " visiting " boys sit behind me . 	0
WD	18667	To my teenage self they were clearly infringing on my territory and I made sure I outperformed them . 	0
WD	18668	That confidence translated when I went next door for Latin , where I righteously covered my tests with my arm to make sure the boy sitting behind me couldn ' t cheat off of me ( a trick he only got away with once ) . 	0
WD	18669	When I arrived at Harvard ( also Sandberg ' s alma mater ) I was never afraid to raise my hand in a seminar , and I quickly learned that the best way to be heard meant jumping into the discussion and not waiting to be recognized . 	0
WD	18670	Most institutions now accept parents ' transcripts , letters from community members , SAT scores and entrance exam scores as proof of achievement . 	0
WD	18671	Colleges and universities are now recognizing that homeschooled children ' s education is as well-rounded as that of their peers . 	0
WD	18672	In the private school system , the administration is more able to deal with the difficult student , even if that mean expelling them from the school . 	0
WD	18673	All of these situations encourage development of social and conflict-resolution skills , expect courteous and respectful behavior and expose children to diversity . 	0
WD	18674	While it is true that they may not spend six hours of every day with same-age peers , many homeschooled children are from large families , are involved in extracurricular activities and lessons , and volunteer in the community . 	0
WD	18675	Socialization One of the most common arguments against homeschooling is that children who learn at home will not have opportunities to socialize with their peers . 	0
WD	18676	Others might purchase commercial online or DVD-based curricula . 	0
WD	18677	Some may hire a tutor or belong to a cooperative where parents take turns teaching in their area of expertise . 	0
WD	18678	This may have been accurate in the past but today , even if parents do not have the required skill set , they have many options . 	0
WD	18679	Meeting Academic Standards Another argument against homeschooling is that students may not be exposed to the same rigorous curriculum standards at home as they would be at school , which would make it difficult to be accepted at postsecondary institutions . 	0

WD	18695	And I totally understand Benedikt ’ s line of thinking . 	0
WD	18696	Ultimately , we as a society lose . 	0

WD	18701	" Most research clearly shows that any gaps in levels of success between younger and older children are usually bridged by the third grade . 	0
WD	18702	As private individuals , kids today remain as free to pray in their schools as they have ever been ; in fact , their right to do so is constitutionally protected . 	0

WD	18713	And that ' s what scares these selfish people that want to take away people ' s freedom and start calling people names just because they are envious of what others have or do ! 	0
WD	18714	After all , the public school systems get tax money from everyone , even from the one ' s who send their kids to private schools . 	0
WD	18715	And the public school doesn ' t provide anything for those kids , but the system still takes their money . 	0
WD	18716	I have three children with kid ' s of the their own , one moved to be able to send his kids to a private school , the other home school ' s her children , while my other children still go to a public school . . . . but they ' re father is a teacher . . . . thank God ! ! 	0

WD	18719	In some schools , mainstreaming of students with disabilities is used only for those classes in which the child has ability to keep up with peers , according to SEA . 	0
WD	18720	Maybe this woman needs to work and give all her money to the public school system so she won ' t be a bad person . 	0
WD	18721	The self consciousness hinders students from asking questions in class , and therefore students get more frustrated by not understanding the material . 	0
WD	18722	There is an event happening at schools all across the country later this month that , according to Freedom From Religion Foundation ( “ FFRF ” ) , people need to be warned about . 	0
WD	18723	Our entire public school system is nothing but a battleground controlled by hate and a hatred that is enforced by bullies . 	0
WD	18724	Our government is based upon hate . 	0
WD	18725	Our entire society is based upon hate . 	0

WD	18753	Additionally , private schools are not encumbered by national teacher ’ s unions or political correctness . 	0
WD	18754	Private schools that compete with each other for students will be forced to find the best teachers available , and will be able to offer flexibility that meets each individual ’ s educational needs . 	0
WD	18755	OTOH , one does read and hear about people who withdraw children from school because they have some dispute with the school about discipline ( school tries to , parents object ) or because the school has failed to address bullying concerns . 	0

WD	18780	But it seems to me that if every single parent sent every single child to public school , public schools would improve . 	0
WD	18781	The report that an increasing number of parents in this country are seeking to homeschool their children is not at all surprising . 	0
WD	18782	However , some persons expressed confusion about this admission from an official of the Ministry of Education recently , because of the high standard of education we afford our children at the nursery , primary and secondary levels . 	0
WD	18783	But rich people will always find a way to game the system : That shouldn ’ t be an argument against an all-in approach to public education any more than it is a case against single-payer health care . ) 	0
WD	18784	( Yes , rich people might cluster . 	0
WD	18785	The media coverage here and abroad about bullying , teasing as well as physical and emotional abuse in public schools is abundant , and it could make a parent want to protect their children from that bad environment . 	0
WD	18786	Certainly there are advantages and disadvantages to homeschooling and if it is an area that is gaining currency in this country , the relevant authorities will need to do some probing to ensure that parents are giving their children instruction in the right manner , and are not in fact putting their children at a disadvantage . 	0
WD	18787	Unless there are individual circumstances I wouldn ' t be sending my children to a single sex school . 	1
WD	18788	Indeed , if homeschooling is really on the rise , Government may have to seek parliamentary approval to institute laws and regulations to govern this method of teaching . 	0
WD	18789	Yet most slum dwellers would much prefer their governments to open schools . 	0
WD	18790	Low-cost private schools thrive in very particular contexts ; for example , they flourish in illegal slum settlements in marginal urban areas , where governments fail to provide public schools because they do not recognise the settlements . 	0
WD	18791	Simple analysis shows that this is the result of the government failing to invest in education . 	0
WD	18792	Low-cost private schools are also evident in other contexts : for example , where government services are largely absent , such as in rural Pakistan . 	0
WD	18793	In doing this , the DFID is following in the ideological footsteps of the World Bank . 	0
WD	18794	Over the past three years , the Department for International Development ( DFID ) has made the controversial move to support low-cost private schools in some countries , such as Nigeria , Ghana , or Pakistan , where public education systems are in desperate need of investment . 	0
WD	18795	This begs the question of whether or not is it a good use of public money from UK taxpayers to invest speculatively in for-profit private schools in poor countries ? 	0
WD	18796	Indeed , a recent DFID Guidance Note on low-cost private schools argues that such schools have a key role to play in expanding education provision , despite acknowledging the fact that “ there is still a lack of data and comparative analysis on education outcomes to assess value for money ” . 	0
WD	18797	I support public school with my taxes and do help the public schools by lowering their class size with one less child . 	0
WD	18798	It certainly is not surprising , therefore , that Christian parents and those who have strong belief systems choose to homeschool their children instead of their developing questionable values in the public school system . 	0
WD	18799	I want my child to have a education that supports my religious beliefs and reinforces what I teach at home . 	0
WD	18800	In this context DFID ought to be making the case for increased domestic investment , as it is the only sustainable solution . 	0
WD	18801	Pakistan spends only 2 . 4% of its gross domestic product ( GDP ) on education against a benchmark of good practice of 6% of GDP . 	0

WD	18815	—but there is always going to be bullying . 	0
WD	18816	On the other hand , some parents were fabulous , agreeing to hand me the leads to the X-Box until I decided the work had improved , or calling on my phone in my lesson to check up . 	0
WD	18817	That , not race , is the difference . 	0
WD	18818	It ' s not something I expect to improve under this government , which has already basically written off a whole sector of society as not worth it . 	0
WD	18819	the fact that they feel comfortable enough telling me is testament to this fact . 	0
WD	18820	It ’ s a lesson I sadly suspect our nation ’ s educators will never learn . 	0
WD	18821	—The boys forget how to act around women and go cuckoo bananas when they go on a field trip together —many girls complain about it ; however , many others have told me that they like it because they are insecure about " being bad readers " and feel more comfortable in an all-girls environment . 	0
WD	18822	The fervency with which school prayer is opposed is not because the ACLU ( an anti-Christian legal group ) is trying to protect atheist from being indoctrinated by religion . 	0

WD	18824	Humanism assumes that the supernatural does not exist and that reality must be discovered purely from man ' s reasoning . 	0
WD	18825	Our public school system has been operating on this foundation since prayer was removed in 1962 . 	0
WD	18826	Since prayer was eliminated from public schools , the quality of education has shown a steady statistical decline . 	0
WD	18827	Is there a link between the two ? 	0
WD	18828	It tells students that they are more than just a collection of chemicals and energy that happen to be occupying space and time . 	0
WD	18829	Returning prayer to school would be an affront to this philosophy because prayer acknowledges the existence of someone greater than man . 	0
WD	18830	Allowing prayer in school sets an important standard . 	0
WD	18831	As much as I hate a lot of things that happen in public education , give me that stupidity over the utter lunacy of teaching kids about invisible father figures in the sky . 	0
WD	18832	Of course , then they could learn about the earth being flat and that big flood too . 	0
WD	18833	You mean when most children weren ' t educated at all , they just worked on their parent ' s farm and a large percentage never learned to read or write ? 	0
WD	18834	Let ' s face facts , if we did away with public education , most private schools are religious these days , that ' s where people would have to turn . 	0
WD	18835	I know that there are plenty of homeschoolers who turn out just fine . . . but I ' ve never met them in reality . 	0

WD	18846	In fact , The National Home Education Research Institute ( NHERI ) reports that homeschoolers actually participate in approximately five different social activities outside the home on a regular basis : boy / girl scouts , dance , swimming lessons , Sunday School , 4-H , homeschool co-ops , sports , theater , music classes and field trips . 	0
WD	18847	Honestly ? 	0
WD	18848	I do however think that one of the biggest pros to homeschooling though ( for those who do it properly and not take advantage of the way the system works ) is that kids can learn at their own pace w / o having to slow down or speed up to suit another child in their class . 	0
WD	18849	More students attending public school doesn ’ t automatically mean more involved parents either . 	0
WD	18850	How would you feel about you 6th grade daughter being in the classroom with a 17 year old predator ? 	0

WD	18854	How would you feel about your child having to endure being bullied and taunted daily and when he reports it to the teacher nothing is done to the bully but your kid gets the snot beaten out of him ? 	0
WD	18855	I wholeheartedly support public education and in fact , our plans include sending our son to public middle and high school . 	1
WD	18856	Or … they ’ d be overcrowded . 	0
WD	18857	The way the current system works , schools in lower-class neighborhoods are overcrowded and underfunded , while schools in wealthier districts enjoy the benefits of higher taxes — and yet , even many of them are also underfunded . 	0
WD	18858	I wish we had a better way to fund schools then based on property lines and tax dollars . 	0
WD	18859	Benedikt , in her push to help promote public education , seems to think that the best way to fix the public school system is to shame parents into sending all the kids there . 	0
WD	18860	And when you complain you will be told that there are procedures that must be followed . 	0
WD	18861	The current formula for funding public schools doesn ’ t automatically mean a bunch more money per school for each new student who enrolls . 	0
WD	18862	Overcrowding public schools isn ’ t going to solve anything . 	0
WD	18863	Every school function I went to most all the parents couldn ' t speak English and the kids would act like they was a little gang member or something . 	0
WD	18864	So , the data about the high percentage of the home-schooling students that graduate and that attended top universities such Harvard , Stanford , Yale , etc . is based on those students I saw in that award ceremony . 	0

WD	18873	The media often frame the argument as one of “ integration ” and “ segregation ” . 	0
WD	18874	However , I personally feel that this is a gross oversimplification which sometimes leads those who proclaim to be allies of the disabled down risky paths . 	0
WD	18875	This was made clear to me last year when disabled charities advocated the closure of the Remploy factories on similar grounds . 	0
WD	18876	I tried SO hard to understand , I didn ’ t want to be ‘ behind ’ the other kids , but it was no good . 	0

WD	18878	This week , examiner . com is having a promo called , “ The Great Debate : to homeschool or not . ” 	0
WD	18879	Why are public educators and superintendents concerned about the growing number of parents who are homeschooling their kids ? 	0
WD	18880	No matter how hard I tried it was not good enough . 	0
WD	18881	Public schools are help hostage by state and federal govenments . 	0
WD	18882	I was home educated from aged 10 onwards ; my parents were the most fantastic , enthusiastic teachers . 	0
WD	18883	Despite the best efforts of teachers and administrators they have no control over curriculum , what happens in the classroom , discipline , or anything else . 	0
WD	18884	Public schools are not influenced by parents , that ' s hooey . 	0
WD	18885	My personal experience of mainstream school was damaging . 	0
WD	18886	My parents didn ’ t take me out of school to ‘ protect me from the world ’ , good grief what a stupid thing to do ! 	0
WD	18887	I wrote this paragraph on a prior commentary because it is a fallacy that a great percentage of the home-schooling students attended top universities : I disagree that all the public schools in Maryland are bad . 	1
WD	18888	The most obvious reason is that with fewer students enrolling in public school , there will be lesser funds going into the system . 	0
WD	18889	Also remember that there ’ s more to education than what ’ s taught . 	0
WD	18890	Being Jewish , nun wasn ’ t really an option . 	0
WD	18891	Thanks in part to Sandberg and her Facebook team , I know that many of the girls I attended middle and high school with have made a variety of different choices as women : some are married , many have children , and some are stay-at-home moms while others are doctors or lawyers ( one even premiered at the Metropolitan Opera this month , while still nursing her five-month-old son ) . 	0
WD	18892	But we can know how people assess their experiences -- like me and my former classmates . 	0
WD	18893	This knowledge and the confidence that comes with it can ' t be discounted . 	0
WD	18894	I wasn ’ t going to an all-women ’ s college , and how many jobs are there where there are strictly women in the workplace ? 	0
WD	18895	Other studies have acknowledged that all-girls ' education doesn ' t necessarily improve academic performance , but they haven ' t found that it hurts either . 	0
WD	18896	Short of being able to do twin experiments ( where one identical twin goes to a coed school and the other goes to a single-sex school ) , we may never know the precise effect of what learning in a single-sex environment does for girls . 	0
WD	18897	A well-publicized 2011 Science paper disagreed , proclaiming that single-sex education can have a long-term negative effect by promoting gender stereotypes . 	0
WD	18898	And while we ' re at it , ladies , it ' s also worth remembering that shaving your legs every day isn ' t a necessity -- and not doing so leaves more time for all kinds of leaning in . 	0
WD	18899	Of course not . 	0
WD	18900	In fact it ’ s part of the reason I feel so strongly about public schools . 	0
WD	18901	Give me a break ! 	0
WD	18902	His argument was that because girls are more structured and academically oriented than boys that more girls in the classroom would give the boys more “ positive school behavior ” to model . 	0
WD	18903	In study conducted by Mieke Van Houte ( 2004 ) he examined whether or not the presence of girls affected the achievement and behavior of boys . 	0
WD	18904	Boys take a more laid-back approach , work less hard , and are distracted more quickly . 	0
WD	18905	“ In general it is stated that girls spend more time doing homework , display less disturbing behaviour in the classroom and play truant less often . 	0
WD	18906	I believe the far more important thing to consider in the single-sex vs . coeducational debate is whether or not the attitudes and emotions of the children involved are adversely or positively affected . 	0
WD	18907	It has been noted in the previous sections that single-sex education can provide a more structured learning environment for both boys and girls . 	0
WD	18908	So maybe the debate really has no footing at all , maybe it is just inherent that boys do not like school as much as girls ? 	0
WD	18909	“ Recently , various studies have demonstrated that boys are less motivated than girls and hold less positive attitudes towards school than girls ( Van Houte , 2004 ) . ” 	0
WD	18910	In another study conducted by Salomone ( 2006 ) she states “ There is some indication that single-sex classes may develop greater self-confidence and broader interests especially among adolescents … . girls report that they feel more comfortable … interact more with teachers … and develop more favorable attitudes towards these subjects ( math and science ) . ” 	0
WD	18911	( Van Houte , 2004 ) ” The study found that indeed the more girls that are in the classroom , the better the boys perform ( Van Houte , 2004 ) , it also found out that it is not so much the mere presence of girls as it is the proportion of girls . 	0
WD	18912	Some children , depending on disposition , may enjoy a single sex school more as they may not make friends from the other sex easily , and being solely around children of their own sex could develop their self-confidence . 	0
WD	18913	Advantages to sending your child to a single sex school include : children will be encouraged to learn how to interact with the other sex , despite not being able to interact every day . 	1
WD	18914	They are also exposed to how different the opposite sex can be , and how to cope with situations that come with being in a co-ed school . 	0
WD	18915	Children are able to interact daily with those from the opposite sex , allowing them to develop their social skills and have a variety of friendships . 	0
WD	18916	Let ’ s look at the advantages to sending your child to a co-ed school . 	1
WD	18917	Since each child is different , there is no specific formula to decide on a school . 	0
WD	18918	Since , the ultimate decision lies with the parents , focus needs to be on how the child would respond to either type of school , based on their personality , interests and general likes and dislikes . 	0
WD	18919	Parents often debate this issue , with many having issues with both co-ed and single sex schools . 	0
WD	18920	The author completely misses the reason why I send my children to private school as well as how to help the education system as a whole . 	0
WD	18921	Being aware of your child ’ s personality is crucial in determining which school you should choose , regardless of whether its co-ed or single sex , since a school ’ s academics , sports and cultural activities are vital issues . 	0
WD	18922	I couldn ' t come up with a more illogical argument . 	0
WD	18923	Parents of private school kids know absolutely nothing would change in the few years their children would attend a public school , even if they voiced their concerns . 	0
WD	18924	So , why waste valuable development years in a childs life when a parent could enroll their child in a private school and give them a better education immediately ? 	0
WD	18925	Seriously , do you think the same teachers who continually go on strike for better wages and less demanding grading scales would listen to parents and actually incorporate suggested changes into their classrooms ? 	0
WD	18926	Unfortunately that has me paying for my children to attend private school , and me paying for BOTH types of education . 	0
WD	18927	A 2009 study by professors at UCLA ' s Graduate School of Education & Information Studies presented data that graduates of all-girls ' schools show stronger academic orientations , especially in math and computer skills , and higher standardized tests scores , than their coed counterparts . 	0
WD	18928	But there was actually a gross violation of the third commandment by the U . S . Supreme Court a year earlier . 	0
WD	18929	When asking friends about whether they preferred public or private schooling for their children I got varied responses : some moved to be near a good public school , others sent their children to private schools because they wanted better discipline and to give them a social and professional head-start for when they left school , and one had tried both and saw pros and cons in each system . 	0
WD	18930	Then there are the fees for education . 	0
WD	18931	On the other hand , when your child excels in a particular area , such as music , languages or sports , or you want your child to have a spiritual education , it might be worth considering schools that have a curriculum focusing on those subjects . 	0
WD	18932	Most of those are private . 	0
WD	18933	Debate constantly rages about public funding of private schools , regardless of the school ’ s wealth raised from fees and donations . 	0
WD	18934	Money will definitely be an issue for us to consider when it comes to deciding which school our sons will attend . 	0
WD	18935	Public schooling is by-and-large free , with voluntary annual fees at around several hundred dollars . 	0
WD	18936	Private schooling costs thousands of dollars . 	0
WD	18937	When all the evidence for public and private schooling is boiled down , I think the most important factors are sending your children to a school where they are safe , secure and will receive a good education from high calibre teachers . 	0
WD	18938	There are schools in both the public and private systems where these factors are paramount , so it is up to us as parents to find the school that ticks as many of our boxes as possible . 	0
WD	18939	Not to mention do you really think anyone wants to pay taxes for the public system and pay huge $ for the private education . 	0
WD	18940	It ' s just like everything else the government has involvement with , failure ! ! 	0
WD	18941	He began to start not caring about school itself , he was very bored . 	0
WD	18942	I ended up pulling him out in 5th Grade into to private education through High School . 	0
WD	18943	I had several issues with the public education system not being able to keep up with my son who happened to be 3 grades ahead of his age level . 	0
WD	18944	Many conversations with the Principal and teachers . 	0
WD	18945	I made 7 . 50 / hr and was able to get an income based grant through the school . 	0
WD	18946	It was the best investment I had made . 	0
WD	18947	Or recite over and over " there is no God ? " 	0
WD	18948	And so , some may argue that single-sex education promotes gender-issued stereotypes . 	0
WD	18949	After just two weeks , the researchers reported that children who had the teacher using sex-specific language played less with children of the other sex . " 	0
WD	18950	My proposed solution would be to create co-ed , public schools that separate the sexes for the subjects of math and science ( debatably the two hardest , most demanding subjects taught in high school and the subjects that evoke the stereotype threat ) and create co-ed environments for all the other subjects . 	0
WD	18951	At the end of the day is it up to the parents : sacrifice your child ' s appreciation and cooperation with the opposite sex for a more specialized , concentrated academic environment ? 	0
WD	18952	This utopian schooling system would essentially provide the best of both worlds . 	0
WD	18953	Then , teachers could focus on targeting the needs for each sex when it comes to math and science , and incorporate both males and females for all other aspects of high school life . 	0
WD	18954	As a former educator , I believe that every child deserves equal access to education in the least restrictive environment possible . 	0
WD	18955	Private schools succeed where public schools fail largely because in a public school the teacher ' s hands are tied by politically correct nonsense . 	1
WD	18956	These hardly constitute the totality of private schools in this country . 	0
WD	18957	So before drawing any definitive conclusions , we need to know how other private schools compare . 	0
WD	18958	Perhaps a study by Luis Benveniste , Martin Carnoy and Richard Rothstein provides an answer . 	0
WD	18959	They concluded that " the social , cultural , and economic backgrounds of the parents and the community in which the school was located seemed to be the main determinant of variation , much more so than a school ' s public or private character or , within the latter group , whether it was religious or secular " ( All Else Equal , RoutledgeFalmer , 2003 ) . 	0
WD	18960	In short , they operate entirely differently . 	0
WD	18961	Therefore , I ' ll go a step farther . 	0
WD	18962	Even when socioeconomic factors are controlled , I don ' t think it ' s fair to compare private schools with public schools . 	0
WD	18963	I also hasten to note that most of the schools in the Lubienskis ' study were religious schools . 	0
WD	18964	We live in between two very highly-regarded public schools , and he will probably attend the local primary school as it is walking distance from our house and many of his friends from day care will be going there too . 	0
WD	18965	AND , then other schools down the line , like The Freshman Academy , are forced to spend their limited resources undoing the damage done by single-sex classes rather than , again , implementing proven techniques to expand academic achievement . 	0
WD	18966	I wasn ' t equipped to deal with a lad with lowered learning and physical disabilities that meant he " broke " really easily either , and seeing him fitting and falling from the chair in my lesson easily rates as one of the scariest moments of my life , until the support got there . 	0
WD	18967	Where does that child get the best education ? 	0
WD	18968	What matters is what is best for that child ' s personality ? 	0
WD	18969	In all honesty , it does not matter which avenue of education grants the best socialization . 	0
WD	18970	You don ' t sit next to them everyday , so you make time to spend with them no matter where they live . 	0
WD	18971	Deep connections are encouraged because you must go out of your way to see your friends . 	0
WD	18972	Some families homeschool year round , taking a month off between semesters to visit family and friends who live out of state . 	0
WD	18973	The opportunities to socialize quite likely outnumber those of public school because of the flexible time schedules . 	0
WD	18974	There is football , cheerleading , sign language , music , etc . There are field trips , playdates , study groups , Bible studies , conferences ( for all ages , not just the parents ) , and the list goes on . 	0
WD	18975	You know the rules , so if you take a job that makes you an agent of government , you need to respect the Constitution . 	0
WD	18976	Carry your Bible and pray if you want , but do it privately . 	1
WD	18977	I would have thought that a Christian would respect the rights of others , especially the rights of children . 	0
WD	18978	The teach in a private school or don ' t teach . 	0
WD	18979	All this time I thought it was God who was supposed to be worshiped . 	0
WD	18980	Not so with Bible thumping literalists . 	0
WD	18981	But much of it is mythology . 	0
WD	18982	Then you can continue to worship your silly book . 	0
WD	18983	Talk to your child about the routine in kindergarten and give him or her a schedule using pictures or words , depending on your child ’ s reading level . 	0
WD	18984	Ask the teacher if you can take photos of the room . 	0
WD	18985	” See if you can meet the teacher before September . 	0
WD	18986	And there are many ways ( beyond the myriad children ’ s books on the subject ) to help prepare your child . 	0
WD	18987	He was fine , and somehow thrived . 	0
WD	18988	I sobbed when I dropped our son off on his first day—not delicate weeping , but chest-heaving sobs . 	0
WD	18989	As with so many things in parenting , you can only be so prepared . 	0
WD	18990	The more your child and you know , the more comfortable everyone will be when starting this new chapter . ” 	0
WD	18991	only God himself can turn this world around and i believe He is tired of all the corruption caused by man . 	0
WD	18992	He is soon to return so we all need to be ready when He comes . 	0
WD	18993	hi . i am a 35year old lady who would love to see prayer back in the schools . 	1
WD	18994	i am writing a paper for my college writing class about the situation . 	0
WD	18995	invite the Lord in and watch the transformation . 	0
WD	18996	prayer should be done openly and privately . 	0
WD	18997	please lets get prayer back in the schools to eliminate all the violence . 	1
WD	18998	I mean why not ? 	0
WD	18999	I have a great solution to this problem - 3 day weekends anyone ? 	0
WD	19000	In Canada , no Christian would ever have to choose between going to Sunday service , and going to school . 	0
WD	19001	I didn ' t . 	0
WD	19002	Did you know that schools are still legally required to make children perform acts of Christian worship in schools ? 	0
WD	19003	Which is why it came as something of a shock to read today that " the vast majority of schools are flouting the law by failing to stage a daily Christian assembly " . 	0
WD	19004	I had no idea . 	0
WD	19005	Parents can opt their kids out , but the children themselves have no say in the matter . 	0
WD	19006	Apparently , under the 1944 Education Act , it is required that schools provide “ broadly Christian worship ” every schoolday . 	0
WD	19007	I vaguely remember some at primary school , but that was a CofE-run establishment so it ' s hardly surprising . 	0
WD	19008	I was surprised to learn that , because when I was at secondary school – a reasonably ordinary comprehensive in Oxford – there was , to my memory , not a single prayer assembly in the five years I was there . 	0
WD	19009	Assuming my experience was at least vaguely representative of the nation ' s , this is hardly a new situation . 	0
WD	19010	I left school a dozen years ago . 	0
WD	19011	Jewish prayer in schools is not a problem , because their Holy day is Saturday , also a day when there is no school . 	0
WD	19012	I don ' t know . 	0
WD	19013	It ' s certainly better than letting religion brainwash your children , which seems to be the other alternative . 	0
WD	19014	Christians , this is not a time to bring up the ‘ if prayer should be in schools ’ debate , because it ’ s a worthless cause . 	0
WD	19015	Instead , let ’ s teach people what it means to pray , even if that means not being seen at all . 	0
WD	19016	You don ’ t need to have your prayer mandated by schools or government , but you also don ’ t need to draw attention to yourself while praying . 	0
WD	19017	Done ! 	0
WD	19018	Prayer that doesn ’ t change the one praying isn ’ t prayer either . 	0
WD	19019	When prayer left the schools it reminded the church that prayer is the Christian ’ s responsibility and not the governments . 	0
WD	19020	It made parents , Sunday school teachers and pastors teach the students what prayer really was , and it is a lot different than some recited sentences once a day or scenes in the smoking section . 	0
WD	19021	It made us rethink what prayer should look like , and rethink what Jesus meant when he said prayer shouldn ’ t be on the street corners making scenes but in our rooms in private . 	0
WD	19022	" The student will develop a persona that they are always bigger , better , and have the upper hand , which might be challenging in their future , " she said . 	0
WD	19023	This is a large developmental gap when trying to get through the state standard curricula , " said Vela . 	0
WD	19024	There are mixed results on whether redshirting is helpful for the child in the long run . 	0
WD	19025	" Even though most school districts want the child to be at least at the age of five , the cut-off date for joining differs according to school district and state , " said Vela . 	0
WD	19026	Effects are highest for low income students and males . " 	0
WD	19027	Redshirting poses challenges not only to children but to teachers and parents . 	0
WD	19028	Alternately , estimates suggest that entering kindergarten early may also have detrimental effect on future outcomes . 	0

WD	19030	" The teacher is mostly impacted by it . 	0
WD	19031	The philosophy involves bringing support services to the child within the classroom instead of taking the student to the services , and stipulates only that the child will benefit from being in the classroom . 	0

WD	19096	Where you could study the World in Highschool , , I might spend two years just to get an overview of the United States History in college . 	0
WD	19097	Another point to be made is your peers , if your a introvert , than it doesn ' t really matter which school you go to on this point , If you are an extrovert then here are the facts : when public school was created , many people grasped it to recieve a free education and now it is a part of everyday life , at least it is in the United States , that means that there are a lot of poeple in public school and so it would be great for an extrovert . 	0

WD	19117	Having attended our district schools myself all throughout my childhood , it is clear that our district schools have issues . . . financially and educationally . 	0
WD	19118	I agree that if I sent my child to a public school I would do everything in my power to help make it a better place for all children but why would I subject my children to that experiment when I have the choice to send them to a private school where I can be involved in the school without having to help fix it ? 	0
WD	19119	I ' m not saying that private schools are worry-free or perfect by any means but our private school is a hell of a lot better than our local district schools . 	0

WD	19124	The private schools that I have visited have a form that they want the parent ’ s sign , that the children can be disciplined . 	0
WD	19125	It is to learn and become educated and become the successful people that we all know they can be . 	0
WD	19126	Forcing your religion on someone else is wrong and if your faith is not strong enough to withstand any of the statements above without you becoming frustrated or enraged , then maybe you should visit your local religious establishment and pray for open mindedness and patience . 	0

WD	19129	As mentioned in a study by Mael ( 1998 ) coeducation classrooms and schools reflect real life and prepare youths for gender interactions and society more so than a single-sex school would , it could also reduce sex stereotypes . 	0
WD	19130	There are MANY issues with how public education is formed , and the parents sending their kids to private school , are not going to make a difference . 	0
WD	19131	We all learned as young women the hard-to-measure notion that females can be leaders in any area just by looking around us at our peers . 	0

WTP	19265	Again , I am hoping that we can work this out . 	0
WTP	19266	It would also be helpful if you could supply your resources . 	0
WTP	19267	I would suggest that the place to verify the information as it pertains to Royal Succession against Burke ' s Peerage - it is the authority on the succession issues . 	1
WTP	19268	In your response on the First Lady talk page , you made a statement that you had no such proof to the affirm the statements that I included on the origins as they relate to Great Britian . 	0
WTP	19269	O^O , before we get into an edit war on the origins of First Lady , may I suggest that we try and work the issue through ourselves or submit the material for a request for comment . 	0
WTP	19270	But just bold didn ' t seem enough , so I used color as well . 	0
WTP	19271	I also decided it was too tough to distinguish between parts of the post , the headings / bullets , and the subheadings . 	0
WTP	19272	While in the process , I realized I could make the posts more concise , and thus merged them as per the topic on the noticeboards . 	0
WTP	19273	I changed the format due to Sceptre and another user here suggesting that the issues were not controversial . 	0

WTP	19275	I don ' t mind removing the formatting , it was just a spur of the moment idea done for readability . 	0
WTP	19276	If you treat the entire strip as an urban area ( a very reasonable thing to do ) , it would rank about 513th on that list . 	0
WTP	19277	If you count Gaza as a state , it truly is one of the densest , but we ' re talking urban areas here . 	0
WTP	19278	Could you please provide a source for that claim ? 	0
WTP	19279	My data seem to disagree with that - see , for example , here , page 77 - Gaza is ranked 36th , and that ' s counting the Gaza city area , not the entire strip , yielding a much higher density of 16 , 450 / km2 . 	1
WTP	19280	Compared to other cities and urban areas around the world , there ' s nothing special about Gaza . 	1
WTP	19281	- 	0
WTP	19282	You might do well to bring the proposed changes here to discuss first , and then add . 	1
WTP	19283	I can ' t speak for Dynablaster , but as far as I ' m concerned , you seem to be in such a rush to add a handful of data and sources , which are meeting conflict . 	0
WTP	19284	- - 	0
WTP	19285	Otherwise , it starts to raise eyebrows , like you ' re pushing your own POV instead of paying attention to accuracy and flow . 	0
WTP	19286	The thing here in my view is that these need to be valid possibilities that have been conjectured by someone whose opinion is relevant ( for one example , a former White House protocol officer ) . 	0
WTP	19287	It bothers me because it ' s far too specific for this article . 	0
WTP	19288	On occasion , yes Hamas has said that , though they also have said they would accept a state within the Green line in exchange for a long term truce . 	0
WTP	19289	Im sure we could find a way to clarify the meaning of what it is they fight for . 	0
WTP	19290	But that is discussion that is best kept separate from determining how , or whether , to include the word " terrorist " . 	0
WTP	19291	Moving on , Lester Bangs hurls similar criticisms at their third album . 	0
WTP	19292	The review of their debut you mentioned complements Page , but pretty much shows dislike towards everything else about the band . 	0
WTP	19293	Zeppelin was certainly one of the most critically popular metal bands , but they certainly were met with negative criticism . 	0
WTP	19294	Grand Funk Railroad was even more reviled than Sabbath and was plenty bluesy . 	0
WTP	19295	You may be right about Deep Purple ' s critical status , though . ( 	0
WTP	19296	There ' s no need to have an image from a controversial ongoing war that is likely to cause edit wars between people who want or don ' t want the image for one reason or another . 	0
WTP	19297	I strongly suggest using an image from a war that didn ' t involve America ( the graves from the American civil war is enough ) and preferably one from long enough ago that it won ' t cause any edit disputes - the Mongol invasions for example . 	0
WTP	19298	I don ' t think it ' s a valid point that it ' s small - would it be okay to have a thumbnail of a detailed photograph of two people enthusiastically copulating on the sexual intercourse article if you couldn ' t see their genitalia in the thumbnail ? 	1
WTP	19299	Is " Burn " bluesier than " Children of the Grave " ? 	0
WTP	19300	How , honestly , were Deep Purple so much more blues-based than Sabbath in your eyes ? 	0
WTP	19301	In all honesty , as heavily flawed as it is , I ' d hardly say that AMG is any worse than the masses as far as music opinions go . 	0
WTP	19302	Is " Highway Star " bluesier than " Paranoid " ? 	0
WTP	19303	( 	0
WTP	19304	The Citizens Commission on Human Rights fails as a RS for this matter , as it is a Scientology front group , IOW a pseudoskeptical group pushing pseudoscientific ideas . 	1
WTP	19305	The very essence of what is involved in the proper understanding of pseudoscience and skepticism are being violated here . 	0
WTP	19306	When pseudoscientists are considered " skeptical " , then we are in the land of pseudoskepticism . 	0
WTP	19307	When believers in " pseudoscience " ( = fake science ) show " skepticism " of mainstream positions and science , they are often engaging in pseudoskepticism ( = fake skepticism ) . 	0
WTP	19308	That ' s what is understood by the terms , and when Scientology and other fringe groups and individuals criticize mainstream positions , they can ' t be trusted , and should definitely not be used as sources here . 	1
WTP	19309	That would be a total twisting of the idea behind this list . 	0
WTP	19310	It must not become a " list of topics characterized as pseudoscience by pseudoskeptical groups and individuals " . 	0
WTP	19311	That is not what the inclusion criteria specify , and since this is what ' s happening here , we need to strengthen the inclusion criteria so it doesn ' t happen again . 	0
WTP	19312	That doesn ' t mean that even Scientology might not have some legitimate criticims , but ( 1 ) they just can ' t be trusted on this matter , and ( 2 ) they don ' t qualify as a source according to our inclusion criteria . 	0
WTP	19313	If they have any legitimate criticisms , then it should be possible to find them in mainstream sources , not fringe sources . 	0
WTP	19314	Clear case of fuzzyness and of little value to this article . 	0
WTP	19315	That isnt fair or accurate . 	1
WTP	19316	It is not " so many " governments that consider Hamas a terrorist organization , in fact many , many more do not consider it a terrorist organization . 	0
WTP	19317	There is also much more on this page dealing with violent activities compared to their social programs . 	0
WTP	19318	For as many users who want to portray Hamas in a " good light " there are many more users who want to try and portray them in a " bad light " , and too few who just want to say who they are and what they do and not put their own spin on it . 	0
WTP	19319	I see no grounds for arguing against this view unless one has poor command of the English language ( or is a creationist ) . 	0
WTP	19320	I am one of many editors - not just Roland - who believe that this article must distinguish clearly between evolution as fact ( e . g . measurable changes in the the descendents of hawthorne flies ) versus evolution as theory ( a set of concepts for understanding how and why these changes are occuring , and why they are important ) . 	0
WTP	19321	Yes , facts are constituted through scientific consensus ( see Latour and Woolgar ´ s superb ethnography , Laboratory Life ) . 	0
WTP	19322	The reason for this apparent dispute is that Slicky is not using English very precisely . 	1
WTP	19323	Moreover , Slicky muddied the waters by naming General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics as facts . 	0
WTP	19324	But this is an inadequate ( necessary but insufficient ) definition of " fact " as it is true of paradigms as well . 	0
WTP	19325	They are theories or paradigms which themselves depend on certain facts . 	0
WTP	19326	they are not . 	0
WTP	19327	That both depend on scientific consensus does not make them the same , it only means they have ( at least ) one point of congruity . 	0
WTP	19328	Roland was quite right to point out that facts and theories are different . 	0
WTP	19329	Help ! 	0
WTP	19330	We need a better paragraph with references to support content . 	0
WTP	19331	I thought the priests education was spelled out in Canon Law and was uniform throughout the world but someone edited the paragraph to make it say what it now says and it is unreferenced . 	0
WTP	19332	Does anyone have a better paragraph they can put here to be a little more comprehensive ( but without using too many words ! ) . 	0
WTP	19333	I thought all priests had to go to the seminary . 	1
WTP	19334	I also dont know what " other approved institution " means . 	0
WTP	19335	Karanacs suggested we maybe expand a bit on what other countries require for priest education . 	0
WTP	19336	Candidates for the priesthood are also evaluated in terms of human , spiritual and pastoral formation . [ 119 ] The sacrament of Holy Orders is always conferred by a bishop through the laying-on of hands , following which the newly-ordained priest is formally clothed in his priestly vestments . [ 111 ] " I was wondering if anyone has any more information here . 	0
WTP	19337	Metal pre-NWOBHM had a sizable blues influence , and even after that . 	0
WTP	19338	Also , lack of a blues influence doesn ' t define metal , given metal emerged out of blues rock . 	1
WTP	19339	Simply put , the claim , by Montaignier , is that it is possible to get rid of the infection with a good immune system , and this , made by someone of the stature of Montaignier , deserves a mention , perhaps in the treatment section . 	0
WTP	19340	Whether his conclusions are correct or not , or shared by anyone else , needs to be contextualised , but claims such as these by Montagnier need to appear in the article . 	1
WTP	19341	It can be contextualised , countered by others , etc , but it must be mentioned . 	0
WTP	19342	Articles such as these often suffer from the conflict between , broadly , science and the humanities . 	1
WTP	19343	Whether he ' s going off the deep end or not in our opinion is not important , what ' s important is a good article that fully and accurately covers and the topic . 	0
WTP	19344	Montagnier is indisputably a reliable source himself , as one who is " generally regarded as trustworthy or authoritative in relation to the subject at hand " . 	0
WTP	19345	Some feel that only conclusions accepted in peer reviewed journals deserve a mention , others realise there ' s a much bigger picture . 	0
WTP	19346	I don ' t live my life based on what the media do or do not make a fuss about . 	0
WTP	19347	However I do update the GAP article as I want it to be accurate , is that not what we are all after ? 	0

WTP	19349	GAP employs 160 , 000 , are they all suddenly not allowed to update this article ? 	0
WTP	19350	Wikipedia is about accuracy not a focus for attacks on the GAP organisation that are unfounded , or as the previous author suggests whitewashing . 	0

WTP	19352	I am going to add a couple more Santa pictures from the Wikicommons . 	0

WTP	19354	I have removed the passage that you reinserted into the article on the American First Lady in which you state that a female President of the United States could choose to be her own First Lady . 	0
WTP	19355	Kid Rock and RATM are really more rap metal , and in their cases I think editor ' s opinion weighs pretty strongly . 	0
WTP	19356	Use of " nu metal " on System of a Down is dubious , though . 	1
WTP	19357	That of course , is sensitive enough terminology as to not state that they are or aren ' t " nu metal . " ( 	0
WTP	19358	I think if Wesley ' s really intent on including that bit , we can just compromise and say " some bands associated with nu metal , " which System of a Down inarguably were , or we wouldn ' t be having this conversation . 	0

WTP	19365	I should also reiterate that Popper was referring specifically to " testability " and " logical status " w . r . t . the concept of " natural selection " , never using the word " pseudoscience " in connection with " Darwinism " or " evolution " . 	0

WTP	19377	Ronabop ' s comment was snarky , but I didn ' t find it particularly uncivil , probably because I interpreted it as a generally sarcastic remark rather than a direct personal attack . 	1
WTP	19378	Specifically , I was reprimanding Somnobot ' s " quit whining " comment , which was patently uncivil , and Talv ' s " I can tell you have an agenda you ' re attempting to push " comment , which I found mildly , but inappropriately , accusatory in nature ( see WP : AGF ) . 	0

WTP	19432	It ' s only " unproven " to the extent that any empirical claim will always remain formally unproven ( see Falsifiability ) ; to label it as such in the lead only places undue weight on an extreme minority viewpoint , even when the medical consensus is still acknowledged . 	0

WTP	19488	I shall simply and incredibly pretentiously quote Wittgenstein and say ' The totality of existing states of affairs is the world . ' 	0
WTP	19489	I ' m going to go ahead and pre-emp your objections to whatever source is going to be presented by noting that although CNN , the Huffington Post and MSNBC are typically seen as liberal and Fox News and WSJ are typically seen as conservative none of these groups identify with a political ideology and they all count as independent sources as far as RS guidelines are concerned . 	0
WTP	19490	However , while the worst MSNBC have done is lean to the left , FOX has a history of failing to do basic fact checking : before Sanford , they called Specter , Foley , and even McCain Democrats on one occasion or another . 	0
WTP	19491	And I ' d not use MSNBC as a source regarding the right-wing . 	0
WTP	19492	I ' d not use MMFA as a source , personally . 	0
WTP	19493	The aversion to placing a picture of an aborted fetus is not based on the fact that it represents some truth people want to conceal ; rather , it is an uneseccary exposure to something that is already the known ugly truth . 	0
WTP	19494	Someone might say the same thing towards a picture of an alley in Calcutta of dying and starving children due to overpopulation , yet this is an appeal to emotion rather than a representation of information relevant to the article . 	0
WTP	19495	I would object on the basis that the pictures informative value is trumped by their sheer grotesqueness . 	0

WTP	19507	Yes , there are other references , however , the lead currently states ( 9 of 10 ) , which is on the high end of that estimates . 	0
WTP	19508	Additionally , the current reference is specific to Africa , and from 2004 , which seems semi biased for the lead . 	0
WTP	19509	The quote that I provided is currently used in every Abbott EIA test on the market , and was revised as of 2006 . 	0
WTP	19510	If the manufacturer doesn ' t seem to think that any more reliable estimates are available , then where is the justification to include it in the Wiki . 	0
WTP	19511	Additionally , there are no peer reviews of the current 2004 citation available , which calls the citation into question . 	0
WTP	19512	An interesting threat , but as previously pointed out GAP employees are entitled to update Wikipedia as much as anyone else . 	1
WTP	19513	I have never deleted anything , without clearly pointing out the reasons ( which of course on wiki are debatable in this forum ) . 	0

WTP	19517	One may expect a spike in the activity here , for better or for worse . 	0
WTP	19518	I would however remind all the watchers of this page , especially admins with semiprotect capabilities , that the Pope will be visiting the United States next week and will likely receive extensive wall-to-wall media coverage . 	0

WTP	19522	Otherwise , no comma should be next to those words . 	0
WTP	19523	If " and current " is meant to be a parenthetical then there should be a comma immediately before and after those words . 	0
WTP	19524	It doesn ' t come from the Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon at all , it is merely published on their web-site ! 	0
WTP	19525	Did no-one actually read the article cited ? 	0
WTP	19526	All this talk about Grand Lodge of BC & Yukon is irrelevant . 	0
WTP	19527	The actual article was originally written by a member of Ars Quattuor Coronati , which is a Masonic Research Lodge which meets in England under the auspices of the United Grand Lodge of England ! 	0
WTP	19528	The statement - " the regularity of his initiations had been disputed " - is a pure fact , and get this : Crowley himself admitted that people disputed his Masonic regularity in his book " Confessions . " 	0
WTP	19529	( NB : It ' s not actually a recognised body of UGLE - it ' s a Grand Lodge in its own right , i . e . an independent body with which UGLE is in amity ) . 	0
WTP	19530	Hence for these reasons , I propose that the original wording should actually stand . 	1
WTP	19531	Note that in the sentence under discussion no attempt is made to discuss the thorny issue of whether an Irregular Masonic body is real Masonic body , or just something that purports to be Masonic . 	0

WTP	19534	I also came here to insert that info but , after reading the lead , I realized that the lead compares Roman Catholcism with Christianity and the lead of the article on Christianity asserts that Christianity is the largest religion in the world . 	0
WTP	19535	I agree that this new information , although interesting , should be left out of the article because comparing Roman Catholicism with Islam is comparing apple and oranges . 	1
WTP	19536	- - 	0
WTP	19537	Thus , there really is no particularly good place in Wikipedia to compare the number of Roman Catholic adherents against the number of Islamic adherents . 	1

WTP	19552	I ' m allowed to comment on a clear history of disruption , and I didn ' t comment on whether you were a good or bad user ( unlike what you said to Chase ) - just that you were clearly disruptive . 	0

WTP	19610	I disagree with both of your perceptions . 	0
WTP	19611	I was just thinking that the article is really more POV in the anti-Catholic direction because of the serious lack of commentary on the multitude of charities and good works accomplished around the world . 	1
WTP	19612	There are millions of people helped by the church on a daily basis through all their many charities , ministries , hospitals , schools , universities etc . Yet we have a whole paragraph in the Vatican II section on the priest scandals as the only current mention of the church ' s work in the present day world . 	0
WTP	19613	If the information was quantified somewhere I would have put the information into the article but it is not quantified on a world basis and we are prevented by Wikipedia policy from creating our own statistics by adding others . 	1

WTP	19651	If you want to argue otherwise , you need to produce reliable secondary sources , because the article lays it out with such sources . 	0
WTP	19652	It ' s almost meaningless from a scholary standpoint . 	0
WTP	19653	In contrast , the body of the article emphasizes that the genre evolved directly from blues rock and psychedelia . 	0
WTP	19654	By the way , there ' s an incline citation in the article at the point where it says metal and hard rock were synonymous . 	0
WTP	19655	The important part about the invisible note is the " established in the article part " . 	0

WTP	19658	" Hard rock " is too vague to really be useful as a genre term , while heavy metal is very well-defined . 	0

WTP	19660	Going back and forth like this is not going to solve anything . 	0

WTP	19746	Secondly , you stated the flag isn ' t mentioned in the section . 	0
WTP	19747	In what way does the Irish Tri-Colour make any benefit to the article any more than the UK flag would ? 	0

WTP	19768	This is always going to be a bone of contention , and it will produce constant " edit wars " for as long as the present construction is stuck to . 	0
WTP	19769	Multiple editors have altered it , mainly because the current format is considered misleading by many Catholics . 	0
WTP	19770	A second point is the first sentence of the article . 	0
WTP	19771	I would suggest something like : " The Roman Catholic Church , more officially termed the Catholic Church … " 	1
WTP	19772	Assuming that the article title remains Roman Catholic Church , the first sentence still needs changing in order to be less misleading , and even offensive to some Catholics . 	1
WTP	19773	The problem here is that what has become the current construction implies ( wrongly ) that the official name of the Church is the Roman Catholic Church , and Catholic Church is an unofficial term . 	0
WTP	19774	The most recent edit has put : " The Catholic Church , often referred to by protestants as the Roman Catholic Church . . . " 	0

WTP	19777	If you want paragraphs about Sabbath at the beginning of an article , go to the Black Sabbath article . 	0
WTP	19778	This article is about heavy metal in general , and saying Sabbath is more important than Zeppelin and Deep Purple is utterly unverifiable . 	0
WTP	19779	What ' s more , anyone could easily shoot that argument down by pointing out that Zeppelin was doing it before Sabbath , and had even more commercial success . 	0
WTP	19780	In general articles , the information provided is more general and less specific . 	0

WTP	19784	No , not at the level of detail you are proposing . 	0
WTP	19785	Anyway , there ' s an alternate image of a pro-life gathering . 	0
WTP	19786	That said , my own personal concern for the pictures is the unintended Amerocentrism ; it would be nice to to have capture an image of activists in the abortion debate in another country . 	0

WTP	19789	After all , " size isn ' t everything , " and many gatherings are considerably smaller affairs than the March for Life or March for Women ' s Lives . 	0
WTP	19790	I don ' t think that the relevancy of an issue can be judged from the apparent turnout in a picture of an isolated protest . 	1
WTP	19791	Another user above expressed the concern that the younger age of the pro-life demonstrators in the photo makes the pro-choice cause appear less current . 	0
WTP	19792	I think the issue is one of scale : the pro-life demonstration is by Bound for Life , a grassroots organization , while the pro-choice image depicts activists at the March for Women ' s Lives . 	0
WTP	19793	Saying he " dictated " the Book of Mormon is a fairly neutral representation of what Smith did , and it takes no position on whether he was " translating " in a scientific sense , receiving text by revelation , or making it up as he went , all 3 of which are theoretically possible . 	1
WTP	19794	Highlighting one of those options or opinions , that it was " translated by the gift and power of God " , is not that important in the context of the sentence as a whole . 	0
WTP	19795	That claim can be and is covered elsewhere . 	0
WTP	19796	Plus it ' s just more wordy and doesn ' t flow as well as the original text . 	0
WTP	19797	I ' m having a very hard time seeing why the first would be preferable . 	1
WTP	19798	It seems to engage in subtle puffery , what with the " over 500 pages . . . in about 60 days " statement . 	0

WTP	19810	If something needs to be sacrificed at the Good Article altar , my suggestion is that we reduce the epidemiological information ( much of paragraph 3 ) to about a sentence , and combine it with paragraph 4 . 	1
WTP	19811	Specifically , those who assert that it is too long should state what information there is superfluous or in some way detracts from the goal of the lede being a readable overview . 	0
WTP	19812	Therefore any criticism of its length should be based on content rather than an arbitrary number . 	0
WTP	19813	What the lede needs to be is a concise , readable overview of the article . 	0

WTP	19818	The soft parts can be compared to the soft parts of an Opeth or Tool song ( both bands two prominent prog metal bands , heavily influenced by Sabbath and especially this album with its innovative heavy / soft approach ) , which , also , hold no blues influences . 	0
WTP	19819	They contain no blues influences at all , basically , and your already stated example is , as said , very poor . 	0
WTP	19820	The softer parts are soft ; neither the chord progressions , the song melodies , the guitar licks , or anything , contain any clear blues influences . 	0
WTP	19821	I wouldn ' t accept that sentence , among other reasons because Hamas is also fighting against the Israeli occupation of what we call Israel , which is not Palestinian land . 	1
WTP	19822	I would propose just taking a sentence from Encarta or Britannica . 	0

WTP	19824	The students were extremely surprised and relieved to know this fact . 	0
WTP	19825	If we are to mention the sex scandals in the lead , my suggestion would be to also include a percentage of total priests accused . 	0
WTP	19826	It is very unfair to all of the faithful , hardworking and self-sacrificing priests out there who are suffering from this misconception and my heart really hurts for them . 	0
WTP	19827	The church response and reforms were not covered by the press hardly at all and I think the aricle serves the public interest by making that known . 	0
WTP	19828	Reasons why I think sex scandals should be mentioned in the lead : I think the article ' s section covering the sex abuse scandal is one of the most important ones because of the recent controversy and press coverage over it . 	1
WTP	19829	In the Archdiocese of Miami the number was 1% of all priests who had worked here since 1950 . 	0

WTP	19831	Catholics have been persecuted more often than they have persecuted - all of these events are notable and relevent to the history of the Church and have been mentioned and wikilinked in the article as such . 	0
WTP	19832	This is not POV , this is following Wikipedia guidelines . 	0
WTP	19833	We cant say that an article is POV just because many instances of persecutions of Catholics are mentioned in greater number than persecutions by Catholics . 	1
WTP	19834	The facts of history bear out the fact that is how it is . 	0
WTP	19835	We can ' t eliminate those facts from the article without violating FA rules that require us to make mention of notable events . 	0
WTP	19836	Just as the Inquisitions are mentioned and the facts relating to the persecution of heretics is provided , so we have given equal treatment to all other persecutions relevant to the Catholic Church . 	0
WTP	19837	I would like to elaborate further on how this article is NPOV . 	0
WTP	19838	The facts regarding the persecutions of Catholics in England , Ireland and Wales are relevant facts that speak directly about the Catholic Church - how it was banned in those areas and people who resisted were dealt with in a particular way - persecutions . 	0
WTP	19839	If the article was not referenced to the top sources required by Wikipedia we could argue this but no one has offered a view of Catholic history different than what we have provided on the current page - even though I have searched for one in my diligent efforts to satisfy Karanacs . 	0

WTP	19877	And if we ' re talking about the Spanish Inquisition , and giving figures , then it is important to note that most of the Inquisition killings occurred in a twenty year period when the Inquisition was run by Torquemada and it was involved in the campaign against supposed false Moorish conversos under Ferdinand and Isabella . 	0
WTP	19878	Pope SIxtus condemned the Spanish Inquisitions procedures at this time , but was brow-beaten by Ferdinand into saying nothing more . 	0
WTP	19879	It could imply thst everyone tsken in by the inquisition was killed . 	0
WTP	19880	In fact the 3-4 , 000 figure is across the Spanish Empire , and over a period of 400 years . 	0
WTP	19881	As Kamen said , most local district courts in Europe executed far more people than the entire Spanish Inquisition over the period 1520 - 1820 . 	0

WTP	19978	In fact , if we want to define " terrorism activities " according to the Geneva Conventions , the government of israel is CLEARLY responsible for the majority of attacks / civilain deaths and injuries in the conflict , and there continued actions causing ( the majority of ) civilian casualties over the years is clear proof of THEIR vioaltion of Geneva Convention article 57 . 	0

WTP	20042	I had assumed from the journal citation in this section that Papadopulos was an HIV researcher . 	0

WTP	20044	So , I don ' t see a problem with POZ as a source to * report opinions * , which is basically what the first part of this section is doing , is it not ? 	1

WTP	20055	This misses the point . 	0
WTP	20056	In order to determine that a given population ' s genetic pool lacks a significant contribution from some other given population , one needs to know first what characterizes the genes of that other population - - in this case , the " Sea People . " 	0
WTP	20057	This is what " Tomer " means by knowing who they were . 	0
WTP	20058	As the genetic character of the Sea People cannot be be determined , screening definitively for it seems impossible . 	1
WTP	20059	Therefore it is unlikely the coastal people interbred with any outsiders to a greater degree than the inland people did . 	0
WTP	20060	While stronger , that still isn ' t a lock . 	1
WTP	20061	The tag ( s ) seem to have been removed ( probably correctly ) because the reasons for adding the tag are no applicable to the tag , or are unarticulated ( or poorly articulated ) or discussed and removed - much like many other articles in WP in fact . 	0

WTP	20170	While we cannot ignore the historical underpinnings of the character , we cannot - with respect to those who believe wholeheartedly in the Flying Fat Man - escape that the wacky stories and abilities attributed to the fellow are beyond those of mortal men . 	0
WTP	20171	Much like the aforementioned example of the Easter Bunny , Santa is a mythical character . 	1
WTP	20172	However , the greater part of the character is fantastical , with enough powers and abilities to make Superman envious . 	0

WTP	20280	In the days before the creation of Israel ( and the mass emigration of sephardic Jews from Islamic Arab countries to Israel ) it was not that unusual for a Sephardic Jewish woman to marry a Muslim man , and in fact , a Jewish ( or Christian ) woman would not be required to convert to Islam to marry a Muslim man under Islamic law ( though a Muslim woman many only marry a Muslim though she may marry a Muslim convert and a woman from another religion not considered a " people of the book " like Jews or Christians would have to convert before Islamic law will recognize the marriage ) . 	1
WTP	20281	Given the other account , that his mother converted to Islam at 9 years old , it may not be clear if his mother was from the grandmother ' s first marriage to the Jewish man or from the second marriage to the sheikh . 	0

WTP	20402	2 ) It makes no mention of the fact that the Norse-Gaels founded Ireland ' s largest city Dublin and as Kings of Dublin established themselves as a regional power for a while . 	0
WTP	20403	Anyone certain of this ? 	0

WTP	20424	Similarly , an inaccurate statement is an inaccurate statement , regardless of whether it ' s been here for a minute or three months . 	0
WTP	20425	Nowhere in this does it imply that Linux was specifically developed to fill it , it only says that it filled a gap . 	0
WTP	20426	I think it ' s rather delusional to dispute it did . 	0
WTP	20427	That ' s not at all what the section says . 	1
WTP	20428	It says : " This left a space for the Linux kernel to fill " . 	0
WTP	20429	However , claims that are contradicted by the prevailing view within the relevant community , or which would significantly alter mainstream assumptions , especially in medicine , require high-quality reliable sources . 	0
WTP	20430	If there are numerous statements from the field that call this unreliable , then it should not be included . 	1
WTP	20431	Oh , I ' m not saying ' correct source ' or anything ( I didn ' t ) , I know WP : V / WP : RS . 	0
WTP	20432	I said we don ' t " give equal validity " to minority views because , like I said , that ' s where I see a lot of this contention steering , sorry if that was a mistake . 	0
WTP	20433	I know an encyclopedia is not a medical journal , but medical articles do require vigor when carefully assessing references . 	0
WTP	20434	You seem to be going with that Montaignier is an authority ( perhaps much less so now than back then ) . 	0
WTP	20435	- - 	0
WTP	20436	That would be more correct really and is not POV since there are no other churches that call itself the Catholic Church . 	0
WTP	20437	Then why are you opposed to including a newer reference than the existing one ? 	0
WTP	20438	This doesn ' t sound like very smart evolution to me … 	1
WTP	20439	It kills 100% of people it infects ? 	0
WTP	20440	It ' s my understanding that one of the purposes of a virus is to reproduce itself , but if every person who is infected with HIV eventually dies , then at some point , so will the virus itself . 	0
WTP	20441	You also continue to be wrong and , as far as I can tell , are appealing to WP policies which do not support your position . 	0
WTP	20442	You are being patient and nice , and I appreciate that . 	0
WTP	20443	You directed me to a section of the NPOV policy dealing with undue weight , which exactly clarifies the point that I am making : " An article should not give undue weight to any aspects of the subject , but should strive to treat each aspect with a weight appropriate to its significance to the subject . 	0
WTP	20444	Our argument is about what constitutes a notable controversy in a WP article on the Roman Catholic Church , and my position is that the sex abuse scandals don ' t make the cut because so many other controversies in the church are so much more notable . 	1
WTP	20445	Given the 2000 year history of the church , and all the things associated with the church , I ' d say even a mention of the sex abuse scandals in the lead is undue weight , based on prominence of placement . 	1
WTP	20446	Note that undue weight can be given in several ways , including , but not limited to , depth of detail , quantity of text , prominence of placement , and juxtaposition of statements " ( emphasis added ) . 	0
WTP	20447	If the lead needs to include a contemporary controversy ( and it is not clear to me that it does ) , I understand mentioning the the sex abuse scandal , although I think that it is much more significant to the Roman Catholic Church , and much more encyclopedia-worthy , to include the debates around the implementation of Summorum Pontificum . 	0
WTP	20448	Like I said before , if it ' s necessary for FA , I ' m not going to stand in the way , but it looks to me like it violates several WP policies . 	0
WTP	20449	Yes , I have . 	1

WTP	20454	I ' ve moved it too , but I won ' t move it back until we have consensus . 	0

WTP	20469	If Time equals Wall Street Journal on opposite sides , then does Salon equals Fox News ? 	0
WTP	20470	If you ask me , it ' s somewhat uncivil to equate Fox News and Wall Street Journal to Time Magazine and Salon . com . 	1
WTP	20471	I have no prob with the paragraph itself , just not where it was . 	0
WTP	20472	It ' s irrelevant for the classification of the language . 	0

WTP	20475	I think having the Origins and Mission paragraph at the top is the most logical place - it tells the reader where the church came from and why it is here . 	1
WTP	20476	To the contrary , it ' s closer to blues than much of Sabbath ' s music , and definitely bluesier than " Sabbath Bloody Sabbath " . 	0
WTP	20477	i don ' t remember saying that Deep Purple were bluesier than Sabbath . 	0
WTP	20478	Discussions should always be attempts to convince others , using reasons . 	0

WTP	20483	Let ' s look at the blues matter from another angle : what does Judas Priest sound like ? 	0
WTP	20484	I ' m assuming this article credits their " discarding " of blues in their classic " British Steel " ( another weakness is this article ' s vagueness ) , which is their sixth album ? 	0

WTP	20486	You are mixing up the name " South Africa " with the geographical area which is now called " South Africa " . 	0
WTP	20487	I do not deny the existence of the country called the " South African Republic " before the Anglo-Boer war . 	0
WTP	20488	The point is that that South Africa was approximately the area that we call the Transvaal . 	0
WTP	20489	It was not the area that we now call South Africa . 	0
WTP	20490	And the government that was then called the " South African Republic " did not evolve into the government that we now call the " Republic of South Africa " ; it was subsumed into / replaced by the 1910 Union Government . 	0

WTP	20492	Best as I can tell , you are arguing to show fetuses , and * not * abortion procedures . . . am I accurate in that guess ? 	0
WTP	20493	My agenda is medical accuracy , where most sexually active women quite regularly have abortions , and we * are * using pictures of abortion procedures . 	0
WTP	20494	By the way , guys , this is an idea of what I mean : Traditional heavy metal . 	0

WTP	20499	So if I personally were describing corrupt abominable people , I might use the word ' sect ' also . 	0
WTP	20500	One thing to consider is that Joseph Smith declares that the dispensation that he proclaims is a restoration of the Truth , and for everyone else - - " all their creeds were an abomination in his sight ; that those professors were all corrupt " . 	0
WTP	20501	Either way , he said the word ' sect ' and so unless you have some clear evidence that it didn ' t mean sect , then it should say ' sect ' . 	1
WTP	20502	We can assume he knows no distinction and just switches terms constantly , or we can assume he deliberately chooses the terms . 	0
WTP	20503	So , Smith uses a lot of different terms back and forth . 	0
WTP	20504	In the lines leading up to the passage where Smith describes his experience in the official Joseph Smith-History from LDS , Smith uses various words to describe religion and religious things . 	0
WTP	20505	In my view , changing from ' sect ' to ' church ' is a POV push . 	0
WTP	20506	I have no axe to grind — not pro-life or pro-choice or pro-homosexual or pro-anything except pro - WP : V and pro - WP : NPOV . 	0
WTP	20507	How would people living in Israel describe it ? 	0
WTP	20508	You don ' t consider the men in the photo to be cooperating ? 	0
WTP	20509	Mmmmmm , you don ' t know me at all .   : - ) I have no favorite scandals . 	0
WTP	20510	You ' re still not getting it ; this has nothing to do with when SA was colonized . 	1
WTP	20511	I happened by a statement that uses the phrase remained under British sovereignty in the context of NI . 	0
WTP	20512	This is in the Judgment of the Court of Human Rights in the " Lawless v Ireland " case in 1961 which states on page 4 of the judgment in the " As to the Facts " section : " Under the Treaty establishing the Irish Free State , signed on 6th December 1921 between the United Kingdom and the Irish Free State , six counties in the North of the Island of Ireland remained under British sovereignty . " 	0
WTP	20513	Considering that the case was defended by the then Attorney General of Ireland Aindrias Ó Caoimh one could reasonably expect the facts to be as viewed by the state itself . 	1
WTP	20514	Perhaps using that phrase would be preferable to any UK word use and you even have a decent reference to substantiate it and those are lawyers speaking . 	1
WTP	20515	I think it ' s important to recognize though that this is an area where potentially we might have compromised and - and arrived at a bill that dealt with the narrow concerns about how a - a previable fetus or child was treated by a hospital . 	0
WTP	20516	I recognize this is a passionate issue , and so I - I won ' t , as I said , belabor the point . 	0
WTP	20517	And if we ' re placing a burden on the doctor that says you have to keep alive even a previable child as long as possible and give them as much medical attention as - as is necessary to try to keep that child alive , then we ' re probably crossing the line in terms of unconstitutionality . 	0
WTP	20518	Viability is the line that has been drawn by the Supreme Court to determine whether or not an abortion can or cannot take place . 	0
WTP	20519	The second reason that it would probably be found unconstitutional is that this essentially says that a doctor is required to provide treatment to a previable child , or fetus , however way you want to describe it . 	0
WTP	20520	For that purpose , I think it would probably be found unconstitutional . 	0
WTP	20521	It was . 	0
WTP	20522	I suggested to Members of the Judiciary Committee that it was unconstitutional and it would be struck down by the Seventh Circuit . 	0
WTP	20523	I recall the last time we had a debate about abortion , we passed a bill out of here . 	0
WTP	20524	Now , as I said before , this probably won ' t make any difference . 	0
WTP	20525	Tenacious misunderstandings are quite a bit more of a problem . 	0
WTP	20526	Contentious misunderstandings — say , using an editorial argument ( and its alleged abandonment ) as a platform to criticize a page or the project as a whole , and in doing so using it as a kicking-off place for several other misunderstandings — is a different , though at this page no less common , problem . 	0
WTP	20527	The long and the short of it : you ' ve been asking for it ; 	0
WTP	20528	The fact that he may not always be thin wouldn ' t have any more bearing than the fact that he will not always be president on whether to put a comma in either sentence . 	0
WTP	20529	Tall and thin are not synonyms . " 	0
WTP	20530	But all of that would miss the point . 	0
WTP	20531	Initial misunderstandings are a common fact of life , but they yield to understanding . 	0
WTP	20532	Well at its heart , all organization is driven by entropy ; the trick is getting the entropy to work for organization , which biological organisms are very good at doing . 	0

WTP	20535	The health care page doesn ' t include any criticism of his positions either . 	0
WTP	20536	And it was a straw man ; you ' re asking me to defend a mischaracterisation of my argument ( that " he availability of the GNU userland in no way affected the popularity of Linux " : of course it did , but the two aren ' t so interlinked regarding the kernel ' s development as to warrant a large part of the intro discussing the history of GNU ) . 	0
WTP	20537	No , this wasn ' t what was suggested at all . 	0
WTP	20538	There ' s not even a link to a criticism page . 	0
WTP	20539	Obviously there ' s no way to fit everything into this article , but it is notable and noteworthy to at least MENTION that he ' s received criticism for certain things . 	0
WTP	20540	Seems kinda ad-like , or at least drifting far off-topic for the page at hand . 	0

WTP	20544	Source : http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/jul/29/memo-outlines-backdoor-amnesty-plan-for-obama/?page=1 Everything I wrote about the administration ' s policy on immigration reform is true , and sourced by a reliable source . 	0
WTP	20545	The notion of using these tools have drawn the ire of many people who say that it is circumventing congressional authority in order to grant illegal immigrants amnesty . 	0
WTP	20546	In terms of immigration policy , a memo that recently surfaced suggests that in-depth discussions have occurred on how to keep many illegal immigrants in the country , which would be at least a temporary alternative to the proposals Democrats in Congress have made to legalize illegal immigrants . 	1
WTP	20547	I was OK with the sentence , I took it to mean issues that have just been brought up in the Modern era as opposed to issues like heresy in the Roman empire age . 	0
WTP	20548	Would you like to propose some kind of rewording ? 	0
WTP	20549	I dont think we can eliminate all mention of criticism in the lead , we are trying to be NPOV and the charity work of the church is mentioned in the first paragraph . 	1
WTP	20550	We just want to know if by stating that foo is unfalsifiable , was Popper - in his own mind - characterizing foo as a pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	20551	I think the point here is not whether " unfalsifiability equals science " is a true statement in general , but rather if Popper felt it to be true a true statement . 	0
WTP	20552	Does anyone here disagree with that ? 	0
WTP	20553	Now that ' s basically my position at the present time , keeping in mind that personal opinions are not what determines content here , but on talk pages we do benefit from exploring the issues involved and explaining why we do or do not support the inclusion or formatting of certain matters . 	0

WTP	21002	Indeed , I could complain about some parts of the article as it is , The section on the Reformation contains some highly critical comments : The most famous scholar of the age , Erasmus , in 1509 wrote In Praise of Folly which captured a widely held opinion about corruption in the church . [ 189 ] Abuses of power , usury , clerical wealth and hypocrisy all contributed to a general feeling among educated people that reform of some sort was necessary . [ 189 ] In 1517 , Martin Luther included his Ninety-Five Theses in a letter to several bishops , hoping to spark debate . [ 190 ] His theses protested key points of Catholic doctrine as well as the sale of indulgences . [ 190 ] Huldrych Zwingli , John Calvin , and others further criticized Catholic teachings . 	1
WTP	21003	These challenges developed into the Protestant Reformation . 	0
WTP	21004	I could object to some of this , Martin Luther inttended to spark more than debate when he posted his theses . 	0

WTP	21144	Perhaps something from earlier history - even very ancient history , would be more appropriate , avoiding the problems of politics , over-attention to recent history ( there are three images related to recent wars involving America , any more than one is too many ) and preferably not so gruesome . 	0
WTP	21145	The image we had before , and I reverted the addition of this image once already , was Peter Fechter dying on the Berlin Wall , though that ' s from a period after the war had ended , so I ' d rather not use that as the ' final ' image for the section . 	1

WTP	21148	It seems a little over the top - Wikipedia is not censored , but do we need to use such a gruesome image to prove a point ? 	0

WTP	21189	I would not put Cartman ' s mom in the same class of characters as SKCK , even though she has often had as much screen-time as any one of thm and is sometimes central to the plot . 	0
WTP	21190	The show has a large supporting cast of characters some of whom become more or less prominent depending on the episode - and we can through in the eight parents , and Ike , while we are at it . 	0
WTP	21191	South prk revolves around the relationshps among Stan , Kyle , Cartman and Kenny , sometimes through their separate adventures . 	0

WTP	21194	When these characters were identified as main , you added " main " to Butters . 	0

WTP	21205	I might as well address this point now : as I had said above the pictures of abortion are pretty NPOV to begin with . 	0
WTP	21206	Pictures displayed matter-of-factly that somehow evoke pity or sympathy do not mean that they can ' t ever be displayed without sharing a point ; they just draw upon innate emotions . 	0
WTP	21207	As was said above I realize this is already a touched upon issue and my comment is nothing new to the argument but I was wondering why is there no actual picture of an abortion / post aborted fetus on this page ? 	0
WTP	21208	The picture is only as POV as the messages following it as I ' ve seen many proponents of abortion openly share them and declare they are worthless appeal to emotion in the context of abortion debate . 	1

WTP	21217	As an aside , I seriously hope that we do not include scientology as sources regarding psychiatry , there is simply no need and it detracts from the case made by ' actual scientists and medical professionals ' . 	0

WTP	21219	This would defuse the oncoming impasse and allow readers to judge for themselves if they consider the sources authoritative . 	0
WTP	21220	I think we should consider properly attributing claims to their sources in-text . 	1
WTP	21221	As I mentioned above , there is no visible context in the picture showing that it has anything to do with either the West Bank or the Gaza Strip . 	0

WTP	21237	That said , I still fail to see what you ' re positing as the source of diversity . 	0
WTP	21238	Let ' s assume we mean ' speciation ' when we talk about ' diversity ' . 	0
WTP	21239	Anyway , that ' s obviously a semantic argument that ' s not worth having . 	0
WTP	21240	Drift and selection in that context act AGAINST the existing diversity , produced by mutations , and can only result in eventual fixation - that is , the elimination of variation . 	0
WTP	21241	If you just mean ' variation ' , e . g . the diversity evident within the human population , then you are wrong . 	1
WTP	21242	Also , I ' m unclear on how you ' re using ' diversity ' - if you mean strictly speciation , then I ' ll agree that drift and selection are important forces that are required to produce speciation , since one couldn ' t have fixation / divergence without them by definition . 	1
WTP	21243	I ' m unclear on what you mean . 	0
WTP	21244	I suppose I am confused , then - could you specify what these different lines of evidence are , one supporting common descent and the other supporting biodiversity ? 	0
WTP	21245	I agree that we don ' t need more discussion about editors themselves . 	0

WTP	21365	Culture is of more interest to me than genetics - - though genetics can be of enormous help in tracking the movements of known or likely carriers of culture . 	0

WTP	21367	Furthermore , some of the groups referred to by a single name in our records were composed of people of very diverse background . 	0

WTP	21480	I can agree with that ( while also noting that the most widely used form of induced fertilized egg / blastocyst / fetus rejections are pharmaceutical , not surgical , in nature ) , but could that mean that the article is lopsided , or how we use pictures in the article is lopsided , or what ? 	0

WTP	21483	However , I can understand their motivations , in that they are wishing to " humanize " and " personalize " , abortion , and one of the more functional tactics in that effort has been using shock images . 	0
WTP	21484	To repeat a refrain , many who have asked for ( and suggested ) pictures are * not * asking for pictures of an abortion procedure , or process , they are asking for gore pictures of a dead human fetus , which is not what this article is about , subject-wise ( Though it could be , if the article was renamed Human aborted fetuses ) . 	0

WTP	21505	- - 	0
WTP	21506	The statement is potentially inaccurate and certainly unwise to feature in the lead . 	0
WTP	21507	Putting this in the lead will just cause more vandalism to the article than there is now ( which is already substantial ) . 	0
WTP	21508	The lead is supposed to be a summary of the body of the article , not an independent editorial . 	0
WTP	21509	Again what were the negative aspects of the MISSIONS ? 	0
WTP	21510	Very little is said about Henry ' s persecutions - or what happened in Ireland Vague criticism . 	0
WTP	21511	Just as America points to a broader page , rather then the USA , and just like Orthodox Church points to something broader than the Eastern Orthodox Church , so too Catholic Church should follow this precedent . 	0
WTP	21512	Until you all back up your personal interpretation with Wikipedia precedence as I have , your argument has no weight . 	0
WTP	21513	I was attempting to answer what appeared to be a genuine question from a first-time poster without making incendiary remarks , not " whitewashing " anything . 	0

WTP	21515	The firing of rockets seems to me to be a desperate measure to resist an ongoing occupation that has imposed a blockade with catastrophic consequences for the Palestinian people . 	0
WTP	21516	What evidence is there that Hamas targets civilians ? 	0
WTP	21517	So permanence can be the result of social factors , not just biology , but it is still permanent . 	0
WTP	21518	or equivalent to " which have been characterized as " ( a present perfect passive-voice adjectival clause ) ? 	0
WTP	21519	So I guess the issue is , roughly : Is the phrase " characterized as " equivalent to " which are characterized as " ( a present-tense passive-voice adjectival clause ) ? 	0
WTP	21520	But as I also said , I believe editors should attempt to be collectively clearer , i . e . to arrive at some kind of consensus about what the scope of the list is in this regard . 	0
WTP	21521	I ' m reasonably OK with this position too , if it turns out to be the consensus position on the scope of the list . 	0

WTP	21528	I was speaking of the article in in general , and was not directing that comment at any specific editor in any way . 	0
WTP	21529	You are mis-understanding me , I was not claiming you were trying to whitewash anything . 	1
WTP	21530	Permanence does not imply irreversibility . 	1
WTP	21531	In fact , there are no references to HIV isolation at all , and I felt it important to include this information . 	0
WTP	21532	I cited the CDC report , as well as the Gallo and Montegnier publications . 	0
WTP	21533	I can not think of a better source than the ORIGINAL papers being cited , as I did . 	0
WTP	21534	Nowhere in this Wiki are there references to the original publications claiming to have isolated HIV . 	0
WTP	21535	I also agree that there should be two separate pages : One for HIV , and another for AIDS , as while they may be intrinsically linked in the cause and effect consensus , they are NOT the same thing . 	1
WTP	21536	There are people who test HIV + who have NEVER developed AIDS and these case start in the 80 ' s . 	0
WTP	21537	If you are going to look at something , then look at it all , and the basis for this article are those three documents , and they are NOWHERE to be found in this article prior to my edits . 	0
WTP	21538	It actually took a great deal of time to locate them for inclusion . 	0
WTP	21539	Seriously , the assetions that dome is a Greek invention or rocket is a German invention are completely contradicted by the text of the articles . 	0
WTP	21540	There should also be a separate article for treatments , a separate article for dissident information . 	0

WTP	21550	By the way , the fact that it ' s obvious to everyone that this material exists to " debunk the creationist " 2nd law " claim " is why I think it should be moved to the section on creation vs . evolution . 	1
WTP	21551	I also agree partially , But I ' m not saying give the latest scandal , just give them the truth , many times people come to wiki for the truth , after they read some scandal within the tabloids . 	0
WTP	21552	I may add something about those if Wassupwestcoast insists on expanding on the bad - just so we have balance but I really think that such an approach will make the article too long . 	1
WTP	21553	It is a serious omission of fact to not tell the reader about the reforms . 	0
WTP	21554	These facts were referenced and need to be replaced . 	0
WTP	21555	Wassupwestcoast , there are some serious flaws in your new rewrite , references numbers 225 and 226 do not support the sentence they reference and number 226 is not a news article , it is an opinion piece which are not OK refs in Wikipedia . 	1
WTP	21556	Also , the recent audit found almost all of the diocese in compliance - there was one or two that did not meet some requirement so they failed - they were in fact doing most of the things required but not all . 	0

WTP	21561	You don ' t seem to view the Mormonism movement as anything of value in either Christian Theology or American History . 	0
WTP	21562	And there is no evidence that any of this has to do , specifically , with Smith ' s later claim to have seen two personages . 	0
WTP	21563	We can forget about Cole ' s earlier 1830 " Book of Pukei " article which has nothing to do with this subject . 	0
WTP	21564	There are many problems with Abner Cole ' s 1831 reporting ( in Palmyra ) of a rumor ( in Ohio ) that Smith was " frequently " seeing God by 1831--something Smith never actually claimed as far as we know . 	0

WTP	21599	Reading my comments above , I do not think I have slandered you or this priest . 	1
WTP	21600	Interesting choice of words . 	0
WTP	21601	I am just stating this fact as a possible problem in using his works to create an encyclopedic Beliefs section . 	0
WTP	21602	I do think that a Nihil Obstat and Imprimatur are necessary to create the section as there are many liberal theologians out there who have been disciplined by the church and whose views are not necessarily in keeping with Roman Catholicism . 	1
WTP	21603	She left Reggae a long time ago after her past album " Music of the Sun " She officially left reggae after her single " Roll It " . 	0
WTP	21604	R&B is not her main genre it is probably her second genre behind Pop Its been on a couple of albums like " Good Girl Gone Bad " and " A Girl Like Me " . 	1
WTP	21605	The one I most agree with is Pop more than anything almost every female artist is labeled as Pop . 	0
WTP	21606	( 3 ) Most people think Pop is just a main genre for most people with softer beats and great vocals . 	0
WTP	21607	( 1 ) Well Acording to All Music " her genres are Pop , Dance-Pop , Urban , Dancehall , Tropical . 	1
WTP	21608	Im am not going to go through her singles , genres just her main page one ' s . 	0
WTP	21609	( 2 ) First let us start with her certain genres on her page R&B , reggae , pop . 	0

WTP	21615	Ok now Im am going to start with the genres " All Music " said , Pop I agree with as said . 	0
WTP	21616	The story is similar in another major source , Robert Walser ' s Running with the Devil : Power , Gender , and Madness in Heavy Metal Music : Judas Preist mentioned on 31 pages ; Queen on 1 . 	0

WTP	21619	I don ' t like the Beach Boys , but that doesn ' t mean they " never were any good " . 	0
WTP	21620	And Zeppelin are without a doubt a metal band ( musicians like Dave Mustaine , Mikael Åkerfeldt , Dee Snider , Scott Ian , and many others cite them as such ) , but they proved that they could be a little diverse and do folk , blues , some reggae and funk influences , etc . , etc . 	1
WTP	21621	search of the term returns only references to Wikipedia articles , hardly a ringing edorsement of the terms relevance . 	0

WTP	21623	Oh wait . . . isn ' t that the kind of picture I suggested ? 	0
WTP	21624	We do not call our male President the " First Gentleman " , therefore it is a illogical to think that we would call a female President " First Lady " . 	1
WTP	21625	By the way , in the event that the President needed to appoint an event hostess for an evening , Protcol would allows her to do so . 	0

WTP	21631	I must stress that you are not credible in this discussion ; your arguments amount to nothing . 	0
WTP	21632	You own their three first albums and I predicted the ' Sabbra Cadabra ' mention . 	0
WTP	21633	Maybe you recall correctly , maybe not , you don ' t know , but these articles are about music , not rocket science ; something you can ' t scrape down on paper , in figures . 	0
WTP	21634	Call it prejudice , but do you dedicated wiki editors develop some kind of deep-rooted persistence to something that is backed by common knowledge and opinion , shared by , what you call , reliable sources alike ? 	0
WTP	21635	In the meantime , I ' ll move the painting from where it ' s suddenly been plonked to a spot more apt until some consensus is arrived at . 	0
WTP	21636	You are clearly not a credible agent in this discussion about Black Sabbath , which you admit here . 	1
WTP	21637	Same goes , actually , for the Ethiopian soldier . 	0

WTP	21643	Being unbiased ignores numerical instances of a thing and simply includes biographical , significant , verifiable data on a thing . 	0
WTP	21644	If anything , trying to force fit more criticism into Obama ' s article for the mere reason that he doesn ' t have as many as Bush ' s is bias . 	1
WTP	21645	It ignores the credibility of the arguments in favor of putting in a matching number . 	0
WTP	21646	I think we ' re running into the same thing we run into on all political Wikipedia articles . 	1
WTP	21647	The argument consistently is " well , this guy has all this criticism , so why doesn ' t this guy get equal amount ? " 	0
WTP	21648	The problem is , that ' s not how balance works . 	1
WTP	21649	You don ' t balance out articles by putting the same amount of criticism in one because this much is in the other , anymore than you determine how many characters , pictures or quotes appear in each article . 	0
WTP	21650	I have no objection to mentioning their election in the lead . 	1
WTP	21651	Before replying , please take the time to actually read what I say . 	0
WTP	21652	Your edit , however , made it seem as though after their election their designation as terrorist should change . 	0

WTP	21656	Every president does it many times while in office , it must be part of the job description , and the press always covers it of course . 	0
WTP	21657	It could turn out in the end that Obama ' s actions in response to the oil spill , and / or the public perception and political fallout , are one of the events of the presidency that ' s worth covering here . 	0
WTP	21658	However , at this point it ' s an event in progress , and too early to tell . 	0
WTP	21659	IT doesn ' t matter that AJ , Palestinian rights groups , whatever invent names for the Israeli army . 	0

WTP	21661	You are seriously proposing a merge of opinionated , Arabist propaganda into the article ? 	0
WTP	21662	Where would it go ? 	0
WTP	21663	You might want to try Human rights in Israel . 	0
WTP	21664	Also , just to be clear - the EU and US military has a presence in the WB , training the Palestinian security forces . 	0
WTP	21665	And no Israeli occupies Gaza . 	0
WTP	21666	" Number one , whenever we define a previable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or the other elements in the Constitution , what we ' re really saying is , in fact , that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a - a child , a nine-month-old - - child that was delivered to term . 	0
WTP	21667	Unfortunately , this bill goes a little bit further , and so I just want to suggest , not that I think it ' ll make too much difference with respect to how we vote , that this is probably not going to survive constitutional scrutiny . " 	0
WTP	21668	And there was some suggestion that we might be able to craft something that might meet constitutional muster with respect to caring for fetuses or children who were delivered in this fashion . 	0
WTP	21669	" Well , it turned out - that during the testimony a number of members who are typically in favor of a woman ' s right to choose an abortion were actually sympathetic to some of the concerns that your - you raised and that were raised by witnesses in the testimony . 	0
WTP	21670	Is that correct ? " 	0
WTP	21671	And one of the concerns that came out in the testimony was the fact that they were not being properly cared for during that brief period of time that they were still living . 	0
WTP	21672	According to the IL Senate transcripts , which links I just included , Obama ' s reasons for opposing the bills can be seen as follows , from his words posted verbatim : " Senator O ' Malley , the testimony during the committee indicated that one of the key concerns was - is that there was a method of abortion , an induced abortion , where the - - the fetus or child , as - as some might describe it , is still temporarily alive outside the womb . 	0
WTP	21673	As for # 1 , if you mean Obama was opposing the bills on state ' s rights , then you ' re wrong , and I ' m not sure where you are getting your sources . 	1
WTP	21674	I mean , it - it would essentially bar abortions , because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child , then this would be an antiabortion statute . 	0
WTP	21675	That determination then , essentially , if it was accepted by a court , would forbid abortions to take place . 	0
WTP	21676	Basically , Pop is her main genre . 	1
WTP	21677	iTunes , her own Myspace and her ownself have identified music genre as " Pop " . 	0
WTP	21678	Why ? 	0
WTP	21679	Is that your favorite genre ? 	0
WTP	21680	Speaking of heavy metal , on the other hand , Sabbath has the advantage . 	0
WTP	21681	Today I listened to Alice In Chains and Kate Bush . 	0
WTP	21682	I am also aware of the differences in musicians ' influences . 	0
WTP	21683	Mikael Åkerfeldt ' s main influence in making Opeth ' s latest album " Watershed " were Scott Walker ' s The Drift , and The Zombie ' s Odessey & Oracle , two non-metal albums . 	0
WTP	21684	RG , you state certainties , except when you say that Zeppelin are without a doubt a metal band . 	1
WTP	21685	They have one foot in the hard rock genre , and the other in the blues genre , together with the influences you mention , and I would hesitantly include heavy metal among those influences , because none of their albums are actual heavy metal ; they don ' t have it as an overhanging concept , but they do have heavy metal-ish ( I ' d say hard rock ) songs in their albums , like " Whole Lotta Love " and " Immigrant Song " . 	0
WTP	21686	And no , that ' s not slander . 	1
WTP	21687	If that ' s unfair it is because the situation is unfair , not because we ' re covering it with a different weight than the sources . 	0

WTP	21739	I disagree that " Personal life sections tend to give WP : UNDUEWEIGHT to information which distracts the reader from the indivdual ' s WP : NOTABILITY . " 	0
WTP	21740	While no one , except mostly reality show stars , become famous / notable for their personal lives , I do not believe that it ' s trivial in the scope of their career and should not be the focus of an encyclopedia . 	1
WTP	21741	But , really , I do not see the Personal life sections as that different than the Early life sections , except for the fact that the Early life sections deal with a person ' s early personal life . . . while the other deals with the person ' s later personal life . 	0
WTP	21742	I also point out that the Chris Brown article handles its section about " the incident " pretty well and it seems to be enough information there for it to have its own section . 	0

WTP	21756	However , I would like to float a compromise addition to the Denialism section , which carefully contrasts skepticism ( Root-Bernstein ) and denialism ( Duesberg ) , drawing on Lederer ' s nuanced article that explores diverse viewpoints and explains how denialism has lost steam in light of newer research and treatments . 	1
WTP	21757	Lederer ' s 2006 article is cited on the AIDS Denialism page . 	0
WTP	21758	When I say " float " , I mean a heart-felt request that all editors who are so dedicated to keeping this page clear will allow 24 hours for everyone to view my changes before reverting . 	0
WTP	21759	Can we all agree to breathe deep and keep calm that long ? 	0
WTP	21760	That might attract some new voices to the discussion , people who might never see my changes if they are reverted in less than two hours . 	0

WTP	21831	Yes , HIV can be made by the " bucketful " . 	1
WTP	21832	Reverse transcriptase activity is shown to occur , and so it is assumed that the DNA that is found must be viral . 	1

WTP	21836	It has been strenuously argued that as Ahmadinejad ' s own website translated the speech as " wiped of the map " that that is the term that should be used here , despite RS ' s translating it correctly as " eliminated from the pages of history " , similarly Ahmadinejad ' s website also says " the regime occupying Jerusalem " . 	0
WTP	21837	You rejected the RS to support wiped off the map because his own website says that but you then object to using occupying regime because you want to use Zionist regime . 	0

WTP	21851	You want to use " wiped of the map " because that was how Ahmadinejad ' s own people translated it yet you seem to be rejecting the same standard for " Zionist regime " . 	0
WTP	21852	Regime does not carry the same pejorative meaning and means a government not a state ( it is clear from any translation that Ahmadinejad meant government ) so clearly they can not be interchangeable . 	1
WTP	21853	Firstly , the wiki page says using entity is " a pejorative for the State of Israel " . 	0
WTP	21854	A search finds 63 , 000 results for entity being used in a translation of the speech ( mostly op-eds and blogs with a few conservative newspapers ) and 357 , 000 results for " Zionist Regime " being used in a translation of the speech ( a large number of mainstream media including Haaretz , CNN , Washington Post , NYT and BBC etc ) . 	0
WTP	21855	Secondly , entity is not even close to the most widespread translation and the first time I have ever heard the word entity used for Israel was this article . 	0

WTP	21876	Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided . 	1
WTP	21877	Of course they take their view of Catholicism from a sensationalistic press rather than going to the source which says a homosexual must be treated with respect , compassion and sensitivity , also unjust disrcimination against them is wrong . 	0

WTP	21882	I have found in the past that no matter how notable a criticism of Obama , or how well-sourced it may be , that the editors on the Obama page will fight it tooth and nail , bringing in other liberal editors from elsewhere on Wikipedia and then claiming ' consensus ' regardless of past editors who provided opposite consensus who just aren ' t present at the time . 	1

WTP	21888	As to confusing , while BP is , as you say , the operator of the well , Transocean is the operator of the rig and Transocean is the driller of the well ; it technically isn ' t an operating well until the drilling rig sails off and a production rig comes in . 	0
WTP	21889	BP is the client , but Transocean is the captain of the ship ( rig / platform ) . 	0
WTP	21890	The Macondo Prospect isn ' t a well , it ' s an oil field . 	0
WTP	21891	What blew up was something drilled for the prior couple months by Transocean ( allegedly faultily , with pieces of their BOP annulus breaking and coming up the riser pipe in chunks , indicating it was not in a condition to prevent a blowout ) and the casing sealed early that morning by Halliburton ( allegedly shoddily ; cementing problems are associated with 18 of 39 blowouts in the previous 15 years ; Halliburton admitted faulty cementing before the Montara oil spill in Australia last year ) . 	0
WTP	21892	The Deepwater Horizon is a drilling rig , known at Wikipedia as an oil platform . 	0

WTP	21896	And , while BP was 65% owner of the field , and so of the oil gushing from that field , the hearings that have been held have raked Transocean and Halliburton over the coals , and the investigations are looking into their actions , inactions and histories as much as BP ' s . 	0

WTP	21910	if your answer is yes , I await your edit to the page ( as I see you have done much editing to it , and will leave it to you ) and will not argue about having this information described in the first paragraph of the " Hamas " page . 	0
WTP	21911	For example , would you agree that in the first paragraph of the " israel " wiki page , it would state that the majority of the Palestinian population and millions of other people around the world regard israel as one of the biggest terrorist states ? ? 	0
WTP	21912	No one here is opposing the idea of including the ( false ) labels that people want to attribute to Hamas , we are just asking for the same treatment as is given to other governing bodies on wikipedia . 	1
WTP	21913	Before they were elected , maybe it would have seemed logical to include this type of view in the first paragraph , but not now , since the main subject surrounding the group ( for the people it represents i . e . the Palestinians ) pertains to it ' s legal standing as a minority government . 	0
WTP	21914	Thank you for moving my comment . . . . . as for the discussion , if you agree that the wiki page for " United States " should state in the first paragraph that it is considered by millions of people around the world as the biggest terrorist state , then I see no problem in doing this with Hamas ' wiki page . 	0

WTP	22457	We both confide apparently in strict terminology , a prerequisite to good science - but be aware that such can be a hindrancewhen talking to the populace , especially when they associate with their everyday use of the word theory something that is on par with god and the scientists crazed notion of knowing virtually nothing except their own keen striving to get their mugshot in the press so the messages about new religious revelations is underminded - and be it so much as to not make the front page . 	0

WTP	22466	There is no justification to support a controversy section , unless I ' m missing something , right ? 	0
WTP	22467	America and Britain have engaged in extensive occupations in many countries and neither of their articles contain any sort of " controversy " section describing them . 	0
WTP	22468	The controversy section has little to do with the " occupation . " 	0

WTP	22470	Some people have shown impatience with the listing of Catholic positives in the article . 	0
WTP	22471	Then a historian who wondered how these Spanish torture devices had reached Sussex discovered not only that the Spanish Inquisition never used these type of devices , but that they were all local and British-made . 	0
WTP	22472	The point is that a balance has to be achieved between positive and negative . 	0
WTP	22473	These were immediately labelled and put into the local museum as " Torture devices of the Spanish Inquisition . " 	0
WTP	22474	For decades people looked at them and tutted in horror at the evils of the Catholic Church . 	0
WTP	22475	Many people ' s views of the Catholic Church have been formed by the " cold-war " propaganda of past eras , which sought to demonize Catholicism through spin and exaggeration . 	1
WTP	22476	A typical example of how this leads people to assume the worst was when some instruments of torture were found in a castle in Sussex 100 years ago . 	0
WTP	22477	Further to Karanacs objections : The article is necessarily broad-brush . 	1
WTP	22478	It cannot deal with every incident and nuance over the past 2000 years , especially if populist pressure tends toward putting in only hegative issues and leaving out the positive . 	0

WTP	22491	However , terms like denialism , misrepresentation and distortion are how main view scientists have received theories differing from HIV causing AIDS . 	0

WTP	22493	Anything that is relevant can be added to the appropriate sections in chronological order of which they occur . 	0
WTP	22494	So , when describing a controversy that has been given the label " denialism " ( a contortion of the English language ) , why is it a " misrepresentation " or " distortion " of a * scientific * WP article to focus on * scientists * in that section ? 	0
WTP	22495	Everyone knows that all sorts of non-scientists have differing views about HIV , including millions of people who totally accept the " single direct cause " paradigm that is mainstream . 	0

WTP	22507	A brief scan through parts of the article reveals some dubious points : In 1521 , the first Catholics were baptized in what would become the first Christian nation in Southeast Asia , the Philippines . [ 171 ] The following year , Franciscan missionaries arrived in what is now Mexico , although they did not begin large-scale baptisms until 1537 , when Pope Paul III determined that the indigenous peoples did have souls . [ 174 ] Over the next 150 years , the missions expanded into southwestern North America . [ 175 ] The native people were legally defined as children , and the priests took on a paternalistic role , often enforced with corporal punishment . [ 176 ] In India , Portuguese missionaries and the Spanish Jesuit Francis Xavier evangelized among a Christian community which had been established by Thomas the Apostle . [ 177 ] I find a lot of this information very dubious . 	1
WTP	22508	Huge numbers were converted in Mexico before 1537 , and I don ' t think there was much serious debate over whether Indians had souls . 	0
WTP	22509	WHO legally defined native people as children , Church , Governments ? 	0
WTP	22510	Where and when ? 	0
WTP	22511	" Corporal punishment " applied to everyone who wasn ' t a noble up until fairly recent times . 	0

WTP	22637	In the thread above , I asked two questions which I still feel will serve as a basis to guide this conversation . 	0
WTP	22638	Remember , this is not a list of definitive pseudosciences , but rather a list of characterizations . 	0
WTP	22639	This perpetrates the inherent bias of this article ' s inclusion criteria which allows for characterizations made by certain notable organizations and people , but disallows characterizations made by other organizations and people just as notable . 	0
WTP	22640	Because some editors feel that these organizations and researchers are in themselves pseuodskeptical and / or pseudoscientific , thus they are ill-equipped to label something a pseudoscience and therefore their views on what they characterize to be a pseudoscience should not be included in this list . 	0
WTP	22641	Why ? 	0
WTP	22642	Recent attempts to include significant views of certain notable organizations , notable academics and notable researchers have been summarily eliminated and denied from this article . 	0
WTP	22643	So , why are we including the characterizations made by these researchers and organizations , but excluding - and moreover disallowing - the characterizations made by other researchers and organizations . 	0
WTP	22644	While per WP : PSCI only a general consensus in the scientific community can truly label a topic as pseudoscience , this article includes entries of topics which have only been characterized as a pseudoscience by one researcher or by one skeptical organization and not the general scientific community . 	0
WTP	22645	The photograph is an evolution of Nast ' s ideal imagery . 	0
WTP	22646	I meant to point out that we should use the one that set the tone for what Santa looks like - a marked departure from Father Christmas and Sinterklaas - for future generations . 	0
WTP	22647	Sorry about that . 	0
WTP	22648	As I re-read my edit summary , I can see how that assumption could be drawn . 	0
WTP	22649	- 	0
WTP	22650	Further , if anyone would like to go ahead and address my substantive points above about what I view as this article ' s inherent bias , I think this article would benefit from that as well . 	0
WTP	22651	These quesions are as follows : If anyone would like to begin by answering these questions , I think that would make an excellent jumping off point to discuss my inclusion of the NPOV article tagging . 	0
WTP	22652	" Mythical " is a compromise , but I think it ' s a fairly accurate one , in that there are without question many myths involving Santa Claus . 	1
WTP	22653	Everything printed , filmed , spoken , or otherwise told about him cannot be true . 	0
WTP	22654	Look at the movie " Ernest Saves Christmas " for instance . 	0

WTP	22669	Yes , I think the point that the article needs to have First Vision information in it is non-controversial , and prior to the edits there was info about the First Vision . 	0

WTP	22704	In any case , I ' m hesitant to call Obama Muslim based on the fourth-grade , partially for ethical reasons , as I don ' t believe in labelling children by religion before they can make a conscious decision , but also because multiple sources ( of which DfMF , AoH , or both , are included ) state that Lolo Soetoro and Ann Dunham emphasised comparative religion over indoctrination . 	1

WTP	22718	The Vatican sees itself in direct competition with Islam . 	0
WTP	22719	Apples and oranges aside , this appears to be how the Vatican views the landscape , and as such , this event constitutes a tremendous psychological milestone from both the Muslim and the Roman Catholic point-of-view . 	0
WTP	22720	This is how I read this story , and from that reading this certainly appears big enough for an In The News feature . 	0

WTP	22896	The bottom line is that the implications within the two pictures are far too obvious . 	0
WTP	22897	The fact is that plenty of distasteful picketing occurs on both sides ( see http://img.timeinc.net/time/daily/2003/0301/protest0121.jpg ) and that silent and subdued protests are far and few between when it comes to topics this fervently debated . 	1
WTP	22898	Specifically , the fact that the pro-life protest is shown as modest and subdued whereas the pro-choice protest is depicted as obnoxious and fervent . 	0
WTP	22899	While the details are not really that relevant ( the fact that one picture contains attractive people in their mid-20 ' s and the other is a badly compressed image of 30-40 year-olds ) the subjects ' activities are . 	0
WTP	22900	Its also worth pointing out that the rally picture is of a much lower quality . 	1
WTP	22901	The one displaying pro-life supporters shows young men and women holding a silent vigil , whereas the pro-choice representation shows older people rallying and picketing obnoxiously . 	0

WTP	22984	So far I only see one source that would classify as such , that being this . 	0
WTP	22985	What Ibaranoff needs to provide is a reliable source ( or several ) that explain why System of a Down shouldn ' t be classified as nu metal ; providing sources that simply don ' t say the words " nu metal " isn ' t the same thing . 	1
WTP	22986	The MTV article cited describes SOAD as a nu metal band and provides a context for them within the genre . 	0

WTP	22988	Aside from that , many of the sources Ibaranoff points to at Talk : System of a Down are album / live reviews . 	0
WTP	22989	Furthermore , one of the primary metal histories used a source for the article , Ian Christe ' s Sound of the Beast , describes them as nu metal as well , in a chapter largely devoted to nu metal ( I just double checked the book this instant ) . 	0

WTP	23001	The version you substituted left the word completely unmentioned , which does * not * aid understanding and accessibility . 	1
WTP	23002	In fact it reduces it , because the reader can only be left in confusion wondering what the vulgar word might have been . 	1
WTP	23003	So clearly you believe we need information on the origin of the word here . 	0

WTP	23006	I support the more correct wording even if it appears to others to be pro-Catholic ( which I dont think it does - facts are facts and we just want to tell the truth ) If we eliminate current wording in favor of Karanacs proposal , we lose several important wikilinks too . 	0
WTP	23007	We can ' t just eliminate important facts just to appear to be not - pro Catholic . 	0

WTP	23016	Secondly , you will note that the Dede Maroz , Christkind or other names for Santa / Father Christmas aren ' t as widely read as this , one of the three main articles on the subject ( the other two being Father Christmas and Saint Nicholas ) , and certainly they aren ' t anywhere near the quality of this one ; they aren ' t a valid comparison . 	1
WTP	23017	Thirdly , the Buddha / Siddhartha argument is closer to the point , but still falls short via definition . 	0

WTP	23074	Roman Catholic Church is part of Christianity and it would be inconsistent to make the comparison here , it would also be off topic for the subject matter of the page . 	0
WTP	23075	What you should do is make that kind of comparison on the Christianity article since you are comparing a whole faith to a whole faith - the number of Christians to the number of Muslims . 	1
WTP	23076	It seems like comparing apples to oranges to put any comment about Muslims outnumbering Roman Catholics . 	0
WTP	23077	This is more than mere History , it has to do with the present day and the two issues of Origin and Mission go together , they are entertwined with each other and extend beyond the concept of History with regards to the church ' s activities in the world today . 	0
WTP	23078	Also , eliminating the Nicene Creed will not help the reader who wants to know what the Catholic Church believes . 	1
WTP	23079	It would relegate the most important part of Roman Catholic Belief to a mere wikilink which I think makes an improper statement and moves the wikilinked page of Nicene Creed out of control of the Roman Catholic page . 	0
WTP	23080	Currently , I dont think the Nicene Creed page is a very good page and if our page eventually becomes FA , that would help the reader have confidence in what he or she is reading on the RCC page which should include the short Nicene Creed quote . 	0

WTP	23335	Your reference to the Geneva conventions supports my point that adding " terrorist tactics " on the wiki pages of U .

WTP	23458	That is the more serious proposal , covering people ' s negative opinions about Obama , and that is precisely what is discouraged on Wikipedia and has been rejected time after time . 	0
WTP	23459	That is normally based in fact , although there is a different sense ( one wholly unsuitable here ) for baseless negative assertions - but even those are assertions of opinion . 	0
WTP	23460	It would fit the Wikipedia concept of a coatrack . 	0

WTP	23462	Responding to Jzyehoshua ' s point , you are referring to a different meaning of the word " criticism " . 	1
WTP	23463	What you initially proposed is that we include negative facts about Obama for the sake of including negative facts , which is not criticism at all . 	0
WTP	23464	And yes , I am disqualifying many of the accounts from which this was brought this up in the past - they are now banned as fake accounts , and the long-term editors here have been very wary of new accounts making similar proposals . 	0

WTP	23471	Well , that ' s a useful criticism , thank you , JoeSmack . 	0
WTP	23472	The new page could also address social ( young adults , thus orphans ) and political ( locations other than South Africa ) issues in more detail . 	0
WTP	23473	In such case , my opinion is that the Denialism section could be excised entirely and moved to the new page instead of being an awkward part of the HIV page . 	0
WTP	23474	Finally , if the issue really boils down to focusing more on the science ( which I generally support ) , perhaps yet another page could be created specifically about " HIV and AIDS Linkage " or some similar title . 	0

WTP	23582	My main objection to change would be the amount of work necessary to re-order the article and re-write . 	0
WTP	23583	The section is probably too long , as I have already said . 	0
WTP	23584	One way of changing it would be to have a sentence ot two on origin and basic mission at the start of the article , with more detailed material placed under " History " and " beliefs " . 	0

WTP	23586	Again , that is just a possible option for discussion . 	0

WTP	23610	To me it sounds like you are giving undue weight to the event which actually was not given a great amount of weight at the time . 	0
WTP	23611	Also , you state that Smith ' s account is in the Pearl of Great Price and is considered scripture by adherents , but only the LDS Church has canonized the 1838 account — other Mormon fundamentalists don ' t necessarily view the account as scripture . 	0

WTP	23733	And beyond that , those who are calling psychiatry a pseudoscience per the CCHR sources are each unto themselves notable academics and researchers ( Thomas Szasz for instance certainly passes the WP : N threshhold , as does Fred Baughman , Julian Whitaker , and Mary Ann Block , to cite a few ) . 	0
WTP	23734	That CCHR is a " pseudoskeptical organization " is just a judgment of a Fyslee ( I tend to agree FWIW ) , but even if it was a judgment of another reliable source , that still doesn ' t disqualify the CCHR as a notable skeptical organization which has characterized something as pseudoscience . 	0

WTP	23773	there was no zionist entity prior to the zionist regime and if the regime in israel will cease to be zionist then israel will cease to be a zionist entity . 	0

WTP	23775	( ec ) Well , where are we then ? 	0
WTP	23776	Popper seems to have espoused the position that falsifiability should be a criterion for considering something scientific , and I think we can all agree that being unfalsifiable is quite problematic , even if sometimes unavoidable . 	0
WTP	23777	This is not an exercise in mindreading , but in listing topics that have been characterized as pseudoscience , where the criteria for what constitutes such a characterization is quite loose , as set by the consensus of contributing editors . 	0

WTP	23799	The original question that opened this thread does seem to have quieted down which may indicate a defacto consensus . 	0
WTP	23800	You are correct that WP : Bold allows and even encourages an attitude of " Just do it " . 	0

WTP	23806	Traditional heavy metal primarily draws from two sources ( one a foreign language source ) , so it ' s in no way indicative of all research available on metal . 	0
WTP	23807	Also , I ' ve long advocated that that page be redirected here ( you don ' t have a " traditional punk rock " article , for comparison ' s sake ) , but the editors who work on that page have been staunchy against that in the past , even though it ' s more or less redundant to this article . 	0
WTP	23808	Of course , some UN or other civilian installations were hit , some with good reason ( any military use cancels the place ' s protection according to the Geneva Conventions ) ; some were hit by error - nothing and no-one is 100% accurate , and when people send rockets from the middle of the city , innocents are bound to get hurt . 	0

WTP	23823	CCHR is clearly not a reliable source for declaring what is and what isn ' t a pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	23824	Does this make sense ? 	0
WTP	23825	Characterized = point of view and hence this article should adhere to NPOV by presenting all significant POVs . 	0
WTP	23826	I will try to help you as much as I can since I am very interested in this subject and I think we could make this not just a good but a featured article one day . 	0

WTP	23828	If you want me to nitpick for a possible improvement I would say scrap the hearse pic and here ' s why . 	1
WTP	23829	This then raises the question of NPOV , which seems to be violated by granting undue weight to the sex abuse scandals . 	0
WTP	23830	Now , if the argument is that the article can ' t be FA unless the lead includes the sex abuse scandals , and we want FA rather than follow WP guidelines , well that ' s ok with me . 	0
WTP	23831	The abuse scandals hardly rate when compared with the other controversies that have surrounded the church . 	0

WTP	23835	The position Ling . 	0
WTP	23836	Nut advocates distorts historical perspective ; compared with other controversies , the sex abuse scandals are barely notable , and including it in the lead gives them far more than their due weight . 	0
WTP	23837	The other passage from WP : LEAD that applies here : " Well-publicized recent events affecting an article subject , whether controversial or not , should be kept in historical perspective . 	0
WTP	23838	Trying to put anything controversial about someone from the left is like pulling teeth around here . 	0

WTP	23873	Indeed . 	0
WTP	23874	I strongly believe that both labels apply to these controversies ( especially the T-shirt one ) , and the article should follow a more general tone anyway . 	0

WTP	23877	There I found the allegations of phosphorus weapon use , so I proceeded to add a few tightly written sentences including citations plus internal and external links . 	0
WTP	23878	So is the " undue weight " argument that that these allegations and countercharges among young Israeli soldiers , with serious repercussions throughout Israeli society , isn ' t as " heavy " as charges of phosphorus weapons use and can ' t appear beside it ? 	0
WTP	23879	I felt the content is relevant in light of interest among the English-language readership ( some of whom are likely to view it as fuel for criticism of the IDF and Israel ; hence my unfortunate use here of the terms " atrocities and war crimes " that I trusted was certainly not to be read as any agenda of my own ! ) . 	0
WTP	23880	It seemed to me a clear case relating to the Israel Defense Forces # Code of Conduct ( not , as you suggest , Purity of Arms ) — but as there ' s no specific incident under that heading , I posted under the heading Controversy . 	0

WTP	23912	I DID NOT " twist your words " . 	1
WTP	23913	You claimed that U . S . / israeli actions are " military " whereas Hamas ' actions are " targeting civilians " . . . . . . and now are citing the Geneva Conventions … . ok … . 	0
WTP	23914	Please . . . . . . when you DO make this argument . . . . . . . . remember to include all of the evidence that israeli " military action " has been successful in advancing israel ' s war against the Palestinians / Lebonese ( gaining military advantages anticipated ) . 	0
WTP	23915	Here ' s MY evidence that this is NOT true : http://a.abcnews.com/m/screen?id=6760726&pid=76 http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/palestinian-attacks-signal-failure-of-military-offensive-652232.html http://origin.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,244139,00.html http://www.ifamericansknew.org/stats/un.html http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article692233.ece 4 . 	1
WTP	23916	. . . so the Geneva Conventions DON ' T support your argument that Hamas ' actions differ from those of U . S . / israel . 	0
WTP	23917	No doubt you will bring attention to the statement : " . . . would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated " . . . in order to argue that U . S . / israeli actions are " necessary " and achieve a ( relatively ) successful military goal and that , in turn , justify the actions making them allowable by the standards of the convention . 	0

WTP	23923	Why are you pushing this common creationist falsehood about Popper ? 	0
WTP	23924	I don ' t think we should only treat the scientific aspects as a default , though we need much more material on this subject than we currently have , and as I mentioned I think the length of the culture section gives undue weight at its current size , though it could probably be expanded much further still with ease . 	0
WTP	23925	As for only treating scientific aspects , that ' s what we used to do , but the culture article was merged here to cover it all in one subject . 	0
WTP	23926	We need much more input on this , as we currently only have one person for splitting ( me ) and one against . 	1

WTP	23931	Unfortunately , the two sides are deadlocked : both cling to their preferred wording and resist any possibility of a compromise wording . 	0
WTP	23932	I have no particular attachment to the form of words I proposed , just a desire to see some wording agreed which roughly accommodates the various perspectives at play here and indicates to the reader that they will need more detail to fully understand what happened . 	0
WTP	23933	I make it $2 . 7 billion for 2009 , rising $150 million every year for the next ten . 	1
WTP	23934	( outdent ) The site also runs afoul of point 6 of WP : ELNO , which prohibits linking to sites which require registration to view the pertinent content . 	1
WTP	23935	The underlying facts are agreed , and clear references are available for them . 	0
WTP	23936	This is a situation I have seen happen before on Irish articles . 	0
WTP	23937	Two sentences do not warrant an individual section . 	0
WTP	23938	It ' s ofcourse not necessary to have a gallery as it says " The gallery tag is not a tool to shoehorn images into an article , and a gallery consisting of an indiscriminate collection of images of the article subject should generally either be improved in accordance with the above paragraph or moved to Wikimedia Commons . " 	1
WTP	23939	This is sensible advice because linking someone ' s words to a Wiki article can impose a meaning on those words that is not contained in the statement they made and consequently it can mislead readers . 	0
WTP	23940	My understanding of that statement is that it means , if it is possible to avoid linking from within quotes , avoid linking from within quotes . 	0
WTP	23941	Also Ibranoff , if you are going to keeping insisting " The sources clearly state that they are not nu metal " , you need to provide those sources so they can be evaluated . 	0
WTP	23942	' Zionist regime ' is a redirect to ' Zionist entity ' , so your links were to ' Zionist entity ' as Wayne said . 	1
WTP	23943	LibiBamizrach , what is shown in the diff I provided above is that your links were ' Zionist regime | the occupying regime ' and ' Zionist regime | Occupying Zionist regime ' . 	0
WTP	23944	Just saying that HIV and AIDS share too much info isn ' t specific , especially as both topics share so much ground and providing similar context shouldn ' t be surprising . 	1

WTP	23946	I ' m not sure what you ' ve addressed previously that we ' ve avoided exactly . 	0
WTP	23947	Maybe something like ' I would like to add these paragraphs , they are as follows . . . ' or ' this sentence needs to be turned into this . . . ' or ' this paragraph needs to be removed . . . ' . 	0

WTP	23952	As for my " very weird silly argument " , there is nothing weird or silly about actions based on WP : MOSQUOTE . 	1
WTP	23953	OK , but as it is repeated , should the copy in the lede stay ? 	1
WTP	23954	I would suggest no , and to keep the copy in the Beliefs section . 	1
WTP	23955	In the lede it sounds quite a bit more specific and indeed almost narrow in context , whereas the rest of the lede is very general , broad , and top-down sounding . 	0
WTP	23956	However , given that I am hearing one " doesn ' t matter " and one ( apparently ) " no keep as is " , I am glad I brought it up first , and any further input welcome and indeed desired . 	0
WTP	23957	Further , I find it curious that I am being urged by several people ( unquestionably dedicated , but perhaps a bit narrow-minded ) to " use the Talk page " when those same people have repeatedly avoided addressing some of the issues I have raised here on Talk about the usability of this article . 	1
WTP	23958	Well , that might sounds a little pov as it might be different to everyone . 	0
WTP	23959	But I do agree with you . 	0
WTP	23960	I ' d be quite happy to see all flags decommissioned from this article . 	0
WTP	23961	As for the ' I don ' t like it ' comment , I don ' t mind these images at all , I ' m just looking for the most suitable one , and preferably not one that ' s going to be removed every few days by someone who objects to it . 	0
WTP	23962	Now to address your point Bleh - your argument regarding sexual images is moot ; there are of course such images at commons if people want to see them , just as there are plenty of gory images of dead people and such , but there is no photograph on sexual intercourse of two individuals at the height of copulation . 	0
WTP	23963	Regarding pictures from long past wars , there obviously won ' t be anything in the form of a photograph , but there plenty of paintings etc . I had a very brief look for something suitable but there was nothing that especially caught my eye . 	0
WTP	23964	There is already a picture from a 20th century war just below in the suicide attack section , as well as the image of American graves in the lead , so I believe it would be more balanced to include something from times long past , like artwork from a chariot battle for example . 	0
WTP	23965	There is no need to show the most graphic or pornographic image just because one is available , and if an image is controversial for whatever reason there should be at least some rationale for keeping it . 	0
WTP	23966	It probably doesn ' t deserve any more than a sentence but not mentioning it could be seen as inconsistent with NPOV requirements . 	0
WTP	23967	Here are some examples but there are many , many more . 	0
WTP	23968	It is used by mainstream RS both in their narrative voice and when they quote prominent sources who use the term routinely . 	0
WTP	23969	< - I don ' t think it ' s reasonable to entirely dismiss the IOF term . 	1
WTP	23970	It would not preclude attributing the material to the author of the work , but as such that should probably be made explicit for clarity . 	0
WTP	23971	What it does preclude is simply attribution of its material to the institutional church itself , as that would be the posterchild of original research . 	0
WTP	23972	Just two cents : the lack of either decree does not in and of itself preclude the use of a source here . 	1
WTP	23973	Glad everyone got back on track here . 	0
WTP	23974	That has been gone over already , Dynablaster provided a list of secondary sources , just waiting for him to include them . 	0
WTP	23975	The official English translation is an original statement by Ahmadinejad and the Iranian government , just as the Persian statement is . 	0
WTP	23976	If you have a link to the original Farsi statement from June 2 , 2008 , please include it in addition to the official Iranian government translation . 	0
WTP	23977	Any suggestions for improvement ? 	0

WTP	24036	I ' m overwhelmed . 	0
WTP	24037	Even though I fail to see the meaning of that article , and how it contradicts this one , it is more accurate in its depict of the musical interrelations of the early bands , with emphasis on Black Sabbath . . 	0

WTP	24041	The paragraph where Black Sabbath , Deep Purple , and Led Zeppelin are mentioned as pioneers of the genre is invalid ; it states that all three bands were reviled by critics . 	1
WTP	24042	First off , Deep Purple met indifference in their start , which is not the same as being reviled , which their albums never were . 	0
WTP	24043	With their success that followed in the U . S . , they were , however , acclaimed . 	0
WTP	24044	Secondly , Led Zeppelin never met criticism like that of Black Sabbath ; Zeppelin were , instead , criticized for not being as good as , according to Rolling Stone in the review of their first album , like The Jeff Beck Group , and Robert Plant was compared condescendingly to Rod Stewart . 	0
WTP	24045	Basically , not the same kind of criticism Black Sabbath got . 	0
WTP	24046	Sabbath were persistently rejected until their fifth album ( I dislike referring to wikipedia articles , but this is backed by the articles for all their first five albums ) Sabbath Bloody Sabbath . 	0
WTP	24047	The criticism was a direct result of their alien-sounding music , which clashed with the current , which was blues-inspired Hard rock , like Zeppelin , Purple , Iron Butterfly etc . To conclude , the introduction falters and misleads , and should be rewritten more accurately . 	0

WTP	24091	The Iranian state-controlled website ( PRESIDENT . IR ) is a primary source of questionable nature . 	0
WTP	24092	What it does tell us , in conjunction with the other article from prominent pre-1900 members of the church is that there was a discussion about Smith ' s claims to have seen a Vision and that vision involved God . 	0
WTP	24093	Further I do not accept that there is a complete consensus in the non-Mormon academic community concerning this matter . 	0
WTP	24094	All Gore tried that one , and well maybe we should believe him , after all he did invent the internet and has does have a Bachelor ' s degree in Government . 	0

WTP	24096	If it did happen , how would including it detract from its relevance ? 	0
WTP	24097	Smith did not claim to " frequently seeing God " just as you say , however what is interesting about this article is when it is taken in context with Smith ' s own writings of how the community received his ideas does support his claims , if somewhat indirectly . 	0

WTP	24100	As for Professor Anderson ' s and other LDS scholars seeming disqualification because they are LDS , from what basis is that authoritative dismissal given ? 	0

WTP	24142	When you look through most other photos , you see the caption is a description given to what the user sees in the photo . 	0
WTP	24143	As I understand it , a caption given by an uploader or by a flikr stream owner is unverifiable and as such not according to WP standards . 	0
WTP	24144	Often it adds information that is only evident to a professional ( explaining that the rhino in the picture is an african rhino ) but a caption should not add information not evident in the photo ( explaining that the rhino ' s name is Susan ) , unless this information can be sourced . 	0

WTP	24216	Your pretense at neutrality by noting that a shock propaganda photo of a dead mom ( a very rare victim of a botched illegal abortion ) is also prohibited ( to suggest the " rule " is balanced ) is extremely transparent . 	0

WTP	24226	I am perplexed that you two ( Eldereft and Fyslee ) are saying that the tag should be removed , when all efforts to install such a tag have been summarily reverted without the benefit of a proper discussion . 	1

WTP	24253	As I ' ve pointed out before , it has been enough of an issue in the UK that a previous Archbishop of Cardiff had to resign over his handling of abuse cases , and Cormac Murphy-O ' Connor also received pretty major coverage for his handling of a case when he was at Arundel ( less justifiably in that case certainly ) . 	0

WTP	24272	I disagree with this , and feel that use of the term ( heavy metal ) throughout the ' 70s was largely consistent with modern standards , and much of the crossing of " hard rock " and " heavy metal " very probably arose from the fact that many hard rock bands of the time did a few metal songs . 	0

WTP	24912	I ' m starting a new thread to break away from the above discussion , which , for the most part , has turned from the subject . 	0
WTP	24913	The controversy section should outline for what practices the IDF has been criticized and why ( with sources ) , not for what specific events , because it is possible to find multiple sources criticizing the IDF for its every single publicized operation at least starting with the First Lebanon War and onwards . 	0
WTP	24914	Feel free to rewrite the section , but please try not to place undue weight on recent events ( Cast Lead , and even the 2006 Lebanon War attracted undue attention on Wikipedia in general , unlike for example the much bigger 1956 Sinai War ) . 	0
WTP	24915	Now , I agree that the controversy section is severely lacking ( in quality , not length ) , and IMO one of the reasons is that this article does not have many dedicated editors . 	0
WTP	24916	There is no reason to detail each incident , and certainly not in the context of soldiers ' coming out ' to ' reveal ' something about the IDF , as indeed there is an entire organization in Israel devoted to this very purpose , which is not mentioned even once in the article . 	0
WTP	24917	Even if many notable organizations accuse the IDF of war crimes here , the article should take a more general approach , such as " The IDF was accused of war crimes for its actions in several operations , including Sabra and Shatila and Operation Cast Lead . [ ref ] " . 	0
WTP	24918	Therefore , I fail to see how something like this would not be undue weight for the article . 	1
WTP	24919	Firstly , I don ' t think it ' s our place to judge whether these actions amounted to war crimes , assuming the testaments are true and were reported correctly . 	0

WTP	25010	In addition , the fact that some HIV-positive people did not get AIDS after many years , as well as the fact that a cure or prevention has still not been discovered , supported the hypothesis that other conditions ( cofactors ) besides HIV infection might be necessary ; that is , AIDS may result from a combination of causes .

WTP	25092	The page on undue weight includes this : Other minority views may require much more extensive description of the majority view in order to avoid misleading the reader . 	0

WTP	25131	The original sources , one of which was Kamen , actually said that the Spanish Inquisition sentenced 3-4% of convicted people to death over its existence , ( technically , released to the civil authority , ) but that only half of these executions were actually carried out . 	0
WTP	25132	I didn ' t quibble about the original quotation , since more qualification would only have made the article longer . 	1
WTP	25133	If you look at the image in full resolution , the death of the soldier depicted is rather obvious - but the lead image should obviously and broadly stand for death at first glance . 	0

WTP	25135	If you believe that any restriction on land ownership is communist , then I ' m afraid you have a definition of " communist " that varies wildly from the commonly accepted definition . 	0
WTP	25136	In any case , this argument is entirely pointless : it ' s quite clear that the generally accepted view is that South Africa is a liberal democracy . 	1
WTP	25137	Nope , I believe the Soviet Union was really communist . 	0
WTP	25138	And , based on living here , I can quite confidently say that South Africa is really not . 	0
WTP	25139	Also , is " death " the first thing the soldier picture evokes ? 	0
WTP	25140	Without the caption , especially at the low image size in the article , it ' s just a person lying on the ground , apparently badly wounded , but not necessarily dead at first glance . 	0

WTP	25163	How about an actual number of the victims of the abusers ? 	0
WTP	25164	This means including the strange yet notable viewpoints of organizations such as CoS . 	0
WTP	25165	If we are going to base our inclusion criteria on characterizations ( viewpoints ) then the article must adhere to the rigors of what NPOV says about viewpoints - in essence , this article must represent all significant viewpoints fairly . 	0
WTP	25166	As it stands now though , the article allows for the inclusion of items which are not pseudosciences - yet they are included in the list because some notable source has characterized it as such . 	0
WTP	25167	Again , if this article was simply " List of Pseudosciences " where we could only include entries that are either obvious pseudosciences or generally considered pseudoscience by the scientific community , then we would not be dealing with this NPOV issue . 	0
WTP	25168	" Pseudoscience " is the characterization du jour and Scientology is a notable source ( not a reliable source of labelling something " pseudoscience " , but a notable source nonetheless which has made such a characterization ) . 	0
WTP	25169	But this article is not simply a list of pseudosciences ; it is rather a list of characterizations made by notable sources . 	0
WTP	25170	If this article were just a list of pseudosciences , then I would agree entirely with you - that Scientology ' s distorted view of science precludes it from representing the scientific community as a whole . 	0

WTP	25191	Some of the entries have only been characterized as such by a small fraction of notable sources while the majority of the scientific community wouldn ' t necessarily apply the same characterization . 	0
WTP	25192	Remember , this article includes entries which are NOT definitively pseudoscience - entries which per PSCI we cannot label as such even in their own articles . 	0
WTP	25193	Since we are dealing with notable characterizations , there is no excuse for dismissing Scientology ' s characterizations . 	0
WTP	25194	This is not a " list of pseudosciences " but rather a " list of topics characterized as pseudoscience " . 	0
WTP	25195	However , this article is not about definitively labelling any topic as pseudoscience , but rather just including topics which have been characterized as pseudoscience by some notable source . 	0
WTP	25196	Enric , I personally agree with you re : Scientology ' s not being reliable at labelling something definitively as pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	25197	As such , we should not exclude their views from this article - as per NPOV . 	0

WTP	25202	But at least as a " List of pseudosciences " using WP : PSCI , it will be the exact same grey which we deal with at Category : Pseudoscience and on the individual article level - articles for those topics which reside in the grey amongst pseudo - , proto - , and fringe science . 	0
WTP	25203	This means that if there is a consensus to categorize a topic in Category : Pseudoscience , then that same consensus could be applied to include the topic in " List of pseudosciences " . 	0
WTP	25204	Absolutely . 	0

WTP	25206	Personally , as much as I find fault with the translation , I think that if that is in fact the legitimate " Official Website of the President of Iran " , then I would like us to add a cited quotation from it . 	0

WTP	25236	It could be argued that Catholics suffered more from this , since in most cases their historic faith was suddenly banned and a new one imposed . 	1
WTP	25237	Fearful of this happening to them , Catholics supported tough measures against protestants - who weren ' t fighting for religious toleration , but for their right to impose their religion on everyone else . 	0

WTP	25272	Books like the Voices of Morebath show that popular involvement with the Church often decreased with the onset of the Reformation . 	0

WTP	25378	I do not feel that it detracts from the encyclopedia . 	0
WTP	25379	When it does detract ( from the article ) , then that is due to what is in the Personal life section obviously mattering to people and having something significant in it ; it does not solely have trivial matters . 	0
WTP	25380	I get your point somewhat . 	0

WTP	25541	This is not vandalism , it is a content . 	0
WTP	25542	I can see two solutions : Personally , I prefer my suggested " technically left and rejoined " wording , because with the addition of only 3 extra words it conveys a much richer picture of what happened than either of two disputed versions . 	1
WTP	25543	The full situation is explained rather well in a succinct paragraph in the history section , but the " rejoined " summary in the intro could mislead the reader into believing that Northern Ireland tried out life in the Free State for a while before packing its bags and going back to London . 	0
WTP	25544	This sort of technical hiatus applies in all sorts of situations , and should of course be described where the issue is considered in detail … but in a one-sentence summary to describe the situation solely as a " rejoining " is misleading . 	1

WTP	25564	Dance-Pop is a fusion genre of Dance Music and Pop Music it is a mix and fusion genres are not allowed into a template according to " Infobox Musical Artist Template " So Dance would probably be a genre for her cause it was on all of her three albums . 	1

WTP	25585	I must remind you that Wikipedia is not censored Yes we may have things here that you may find objectionable but that is not a reason to not include the content if it is freely licensed and appropriate for the topic ( death ) , death and destruction is not pretty and perhaps those who promote it will reconsider after seeing the end results , it ' s not a picture of capital punishment , but appropriate for the murder / homicide section if there is one in this article . 	1

WTP	25587	In a speech on June 3rd 2008 , the official website for the Iranian President quotes Ahmadinejad as saying " the Zionist Regime of Israel faces a deadend and will under God ' s grace be wiped off the map .

WTP	25593	The quasi-religious defense of a monolithic consensus is the main problem that is undermining the value of this page . 	1
WTP	25594	As I said recently , the lead should focus on scientific facts , with minimal mention of social consequences . 	1
WTP	25595	Highlighting orphans in the lead here ( rather than only in the main body of text on HIV ) is itself an example of undue weight , because it over-dramatizes the social aspect of an article about a virus . 	1
WTP	25596	The social , economic , etc . consequences are covered on the AIDS page . 	0

WTP	25600	So as to avoid making the perfect the enemy of the good , I would strongly suggest drafting a way to mention it in the lede , even if only a very minimal mention , so as to discourage such understandable but in the end not helpful edits . 	1
WTP	25601	While I fully agree with the concerns of recentism and historical balance ( consider in 1000 years what this article would look like : this flap would barely get a footnote if that ! ) , I also recognize the empirical reality Karanacs and others have mentioned , that if no mention is made in the lede , editors less informed about the editorial issues here will even in good faith bombard it with edits to mention it . 	0

WTP	25626	I think whoever added that info is confusing Edgar Bergen ' s funeral with Henson ' s - - since Henson and Kermit did speak at that funeral . 	1
WTP	25627	I don ' t think Kermit spoke at Henson ' s funeral . 	1
WTP	25628	Steve Whitmire was not officially named as Henson ' s successor for Kermit until MUCH later , and his first appearance performing Kermit was in the special the Muppet did remembering Jim Henson . 	0

WTP	25635	Without the quote the reader is left to rely on the opinion from editor ' s who haven ' t researched into the matter as much as the sources of the quote . 	0

WTP	25648	Biodiversity does not have to increase . 	1
WTP	25649	The current trees produced go back to approx 550 million years back ( based on Cambrian explosion ) , that is our tree of biodiversity based on fossils , molecular similarity , etc etc . The fact that the tree converges to a common ancestor is based on evidence quite different from the evidence used to justify our current tree for biodiversity . 	1
WTP	25650	That ' s why biodiversity and common ancestor are two different theories that complement each other . 	0
WTP	25651	Saying that drift and selection do not produce diversity is therefore a very wrong statement . 	1
WTP	25652	You have to differentiate biodiversity from common ancestor . 	0
WTP	25653	Mutations , by themselves , will never produce diversity without a mechanism to retain the beneficial ones . 	0
WTP	25654	So mutation is the raw material for these two mechanisms to produce diversity . 	0
WTP	25655	You are very confused about evolution . 	0
WTP	25656	Drift and selection are mechanisms that act on mutations to produce diversity . 	0

WTP	25701	Basically everything that ' s played in a minor pentatonic scale ( the final verses are in natural minor , the common minor scale , which is used by guys like Beethoven , for example ) is blues to you , and that ' s a very amateur approach , I must say . 	0
WTP	25702	I have already remarked on your less knowledgeable status as a musician which is clearly visible ; the final verses of " Black Sabbath " are in a minor scale and not bluesy in any way , but since you see them as blues , I kind of get where you ' re coming from . 	0

WTP	25777	The term apparently did exist by that point ( the first use by a critic according to this article was in 1968 ) , though it seemingly ( again , according to this article and its sources ) wasn ' t used by a writer in a context ( relatively ) in line with its current until 1971 on Sir Lord Baltimore . 	0

WTP	25782	" Highway Star " is sort of the prototype for a lot of speed metal and flashy ' 80s stuff , while " War Pigs " was obviously very influential to a lot of the doom metal and ' stoner metal ' material from the ' 70s ( Pentagram , Bedemon ) on . 	0

WTP	25801	Keepcalmandcarryon , I did not state that the treatment causes resistance to CXCR4 I merely pointed out that Hutter ' s patient did have the CXCR4 virus before the treatment which is a fact . 	1
WTP	25802	In one of the edits you reverted I had added a CNN article as a reference which had information about this issue . 	0
WTP	25803	" This finding is very surprising . " 	0
WTP	25804	As such the use of the term " Resistance to CCR5 inhibition is also less important if CXCR4 strains of HIV emerge ( these use CXCR4 rather than CCR5 as a coreceptor , from which they become independent ) , and the patient carried this virus at low levels " is fairly deceptive since it implies that this treatment does nothing for the CXCR4 virus . 	1
WTP	25805	However , following the transplant , signs of leukemia and HIV were absent . 	0
WTP	25806	" There is no really conclusive explanation why we didn ' t observe any rebound of HIV , " Hutter said . 	0

WTP	25812	I also want to add that the Siena College Poll is a well respected poll for Presidential rankings , and has been one of the main contributors to those rankings for almost 30 years . 	0

WTP	25816	Looks good to me . 	0
WTP	25817	But anyway , even if it were a criticism we don ' t divide the article into criticism and praise sections , but rather work things into the right article ( s ) in due proportion to their biographical importance and relevance . 	0

WTP	25990	It is a violation of WP : SYNTH , as well as a logical fallacy known as poisoning the well . 	0
WTP	25991	I ' ve already addressed that argument , several times : Putting aside the veracity of the claim that the charge was " rejected " in the Hezbollah case ( it was not ) , it is irrelevant editorializing to imply that what was claimed in one different instance ( different time , different place , different organization ) is also the case in this instance . 	1
WTP	25992	In the discussion above under the heading Misleading Description of Partition , editors are unable to agree on a form of summary wording to use in the lead section of this article to describe the fate of Northern Ireland under the Anglo-Irish Treaty . 	1
WTP	25993	One side insists that it is right to say that Northern Ireland " remained in the United Kingdom " ; the other prefers to say that it " rejoined the United Kingdom " . 	0
WTP	25994	From what I can see , neither side is wrong , but it appears that the reality is more complex than is implied by either of those short phrases . 	0
WTP	25995	The underlying facts do not seem to be in dispute , and are set out in detail both later this article at Ireland # History and also in Northern Ireland # History . 	0
WTP	25996	The treaty provided that Northern Ireland would become part of the Irish Free State , but would have the right to opt out and become part of the United Kingdom . 	1
WTP	25997	There appears to be agreement that there was clear expectation on all sides that it would do so , and this was done immediately after the treaty came into effect . 	1
WTP	25998	The whole process , which involved the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland travelling overland to London to personally present the documents , took 48 hours . 	1
WTP	25999	I have seen no suggestion either in this discussion or in related articles that at any point in those 48 hours the Irish Free State had any practical control of affairs within Northern Ireland . 	0
WTP	26000	So I suggested a compromise wording : " technically left and rejoined the United Kingdom " . 	0

WTP	26004	you obviously would like to use " international political definitions " when it suits your position ( as you just stated ) but will ignore these same references when your position is refuted ( as stated above with the U .

WTP	26007	As well as the sentence been recentist , it paints a bias athiest / protestant centric picture that in the modern day , the Catholic Church has no worth and its only standing is for the sensationalistic American media to whine about its followers and highlight some of the negatives ( sex abuse scandal ) , while giving attention to none of the positives . 	0

WTP	26019	Maybe slightly more so in American English than British English as you indicate , but by no means is it something you ' d say in conversation with an elderly relative in the UK   ; ) However , as I am sure you are very much aware , Wikipedia is not censored . 	1
WTP	26020	There is a general content disclaimer , which applies to every article no matter how " basic " , regarding content . 	0
WTP	26021	- - 	0
WTP	26022	Please , let ' s assume good will and discuss this matter here . 	0
WTP	26023	You yourself partly justified Elizabeth ' s repressions by referring to the threat of invasion and internal rebellion . 	0
WTP	26024	That ' s fairly obvious , just like a history or pattern of lies , misbehavior or criminal behavior by Hamas would be relevant when they seemed to state a similar lie in 2008 or were accused of similar misbehavior or criminal behavior in 2008 or 2009 . 	0
WTP	26025	But my reference in the " Proximity to Civilians . . . " section to the Salon article about Hezbollah - - " the same accusation was rejected when it was made during Israel ' s 2006 war against Hezbollah in Lebanon . [ 184 ] " - - has been repeatedly removed here without explanation . 	0
WTP	26026	This , as I said earlier , is a complex issue . 	0
WTP	26027	I ' m looking for a replacement . 	0
WTP	26028	I notice that one of our iconic Santa images got deleted . 	0
WTP	26029	I ' m very sorry : that crucial point got lost in all the volumes of discussion . 	0
WTP	26030	  : ( Hopefully the RFC will help to generate some wider consensus , so that it ' s not just me and thee agreeing .   : ) - - 	0
WTP	26031	With regard to the English reformation , things like the disembowelment of priests , the Pilgrimage of Grace , the Prayer Book rebellion , the Northern Rising and the massacres of catholics that followed haven ' t been mentioned . 	0
WTP	26032	Nor does the passage emphasize the fact that in most countries the Reformation was state-imposed , people were forced to accept the new religion , their churches , church properties and the fruits of their donations were seized and handed over to the princes , and their worship forbidden . 	0
WTP	26033	You haven ' t addressed the argument above at all . 	0
WTP	26034	No one has . 	0
WTP	26035	Again , the section title is " close proximity to civilians , " a charge by Israel against Hamas , and Israel made precisely the same charge against Hezbollah . 	0
WTP	26036	Comment Well , it would be strange to " support " myself , but to repeat it : I think that the article needs a lead image that stands for " death " as broadly as possible , at least broadly for human death , which is what the article does focus on . 	0
WTP	26037	Instead of the painting ( which I inserted after suggesting it here and receiving no response for several days ) I would also agree with any other image of a human skull , although I think that the painting is very fitting . 	0
WTP	26038	The dead Gettysburg soldier is too specific for a lead image : this is not death in general , it ' s the death of a soldier in war . 	1
WTP	26039	The guy that sets our pub quiz said it was Gay And Proud , though it ' s probably just hearsay --Robert , Cambridge 	0

WTP	26047	What is " obscene " is - first - suggesting that South Africa is comparable to Zimbabwe in that respect - and second - assuming that because the Communist Party is a member of the ruling alliance , that it must be a communist state . 	0

WTP	26049	Using the word sects , but quoting it , clues in the reader that Smith ' s 1830s use of the term may not necessarily mean what the modern reader might think . 	0
WTP	26050	It also lets us side-step the question of Smith ' s precise meaning . 	0
WTP	26051	I doubt the term sect had the same pejorative connotation in the 1830s as it does today , though certainly Smith was antisectarian , and like any Christian primitivist in the 1820s thought that sects and denominations were a corruption of the Christian church . 	1
WTP	26052	But rather than trying to parse the primary sources ourselves ( which could be [ [ WP : OR | original research ) , I think we ought to let the secondary sources guide us . 	0
WTP	26053	When Jan Shipps describes the vision story in her Mormonism ( 1985 ) book , page 9 , she uses the word sects in quotes : " this theophany answered the lad ' s question about which of the ' sects ' were right and which were wrong . " 	0
WTP	26054	Maybe that ' s the proper approach . 	1
WTP	26055	I don ' t think it ' s wrong , or necessarily non-neutral , to use a word like church or denomination in this context , but using Smith ' s own language--like Shipps does--has the added advantage of reflecting the flavor of Smith ' s early anti-sectarian views which he shared with other Christian primitivists . 	0
WTP	26056	I know some of the existing secondary sources , like Bushman ' s Smith biography , don ' t really make a distinction between church , denomination , and sect , but that ' s probably just because the authors haven ' t specifically thought of it as an issue . 	0
WTP	26057	I guess Bryan R . Wilson would be a very reliable source on the " historical usage " of the term sect . 	0
WTP	26058	I was actually looking for it in the FAQ at first . . . 	0

WTP	26062	The real issue is that DeltoidNoob ' s edit says that Smith translated " by the gift and power of God " . 	1
WTP	26063	I ' m confused about how you came to this conclusion . 	0
WTP	26064	' Crucifixion of St . Peter , by Caravaggio ' is also POV from a religious viewpoint and we should look for an alternative for this image . 	1
WTP	26065	Basically the argument boils down to censorship and this is not allowed by policy , and as someone else noted previously above we should have pictures of dead humans or animals to illustrate the topic of death not ' less offensive ' alternatives , some of which are off topic in this article . 	0

WTP	26067	I also notice that the source for throwing the rock has devoted more space to Ahmadinejad discussing Israeli-Palestinian peace talks so I ' m baffled as to why User : LibiBamizrach didn ' t include that in his edit as well considering that is unambiguously more notable than throwing the rock . 	0

WTP	26073	Isn ' t that a good thing ? 	0
WTP	26074	This would be a completely useful list , rather than the mess we are working on now ! 	0
WTP	26075	My guess as to why we haven ' t adopted this obvious and logical solution is that some editors want so badly to associate certain non-pseudoscientific topics with pseudoscience , that they are willing to throw NPOV and logic out the window just for the satisfaction of including such topics in this muddled and unencyclopaedic list . 	0
WTP	26076	Maybe you could be more specific ? 	0
WTP	26077	We can ' t allow some characterizations made by one kind of notable source but disallow other characterizations made by another kind of notable source . 	0
WTP	26078	This is a blatant breach of NPOV . 	0
WTP	26079	The inclusion criteria allows for grey and - per NPOV - all significant grey can and should be included in this list article . 	0
WTP	26080	Now then , if that is a problem for us - if we cannot comply with NPOV - then I suggest ( as I have often suggested ) that this article becomes the very definitive " List of pseudosciences " and adheres strictly to the guidelines of WP : PSCI ( part of NPOV ) ; whereas we would only be able to include items which have been deemed pseudosciences per the general opinion of the scientific community . 	0
WTP	26081	I absolutely see what you are getting at and agree with you fully . 	0
WTP	26082	But where and how do we draw the line ? 	0
WTP	26083	We can ' t just allow some grey and disallow others , because " grey " equals " viewpoints " ( i . e . It is the viewpoint of the Society of Foo Skeptics that foo is pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	26084	Or Dr . Somewhat Notable has the unique viewpoint that foo is pseudoscience . ) 	0

WTP	26100	Also , most of the afforementioned articles do not share Abortion ' s hot-button pedigree , so there is little comparison between other articles ' use of graphic images and this one ' s failure to do so . 	0
WTP	26101	I cannot say whether graphic images at Gonorrhea , Feces , or Anencephaly add informative value to those articles , but , I don ' t edit them and so I will leave it to the Wikipedians who do to determine what is appropriate there . 	0
WTP	26102	Frankly , the " but other articles do it " defense doesn ' t hold water . 	1
WTP	26103	Other than being uninformative , it is my opinion that such images would detract from the quality of this article , by lessening its stringent adherance to NPOV . 	0
WTP	26104	Thus , their only function would be argumentative , and this is not the role of an encyclopedia . 	0

WTP	26219	There are bands that play ' hard ' ( riff driven , aggressive ) forms of rock , but aren ' t necessarily straight hard rock . 	0

WTP	26222	I ' m quite aware of the term " heavy metal rock , " and have heard it used . 	0
WTP	26223	When do the sources actually say that ? 	0
WTP	26224	If " hard rock " is vague in any sense other than its direct relation to metal , it ' s because of its use as an umbrella term , which I suspect is only partially connected to hard rock as a genre in-and-of itself . 	1

WTP	26255	I don ' t think any other religion article breaks " origins " away from " history " and I don ' t think they should - the two terms are synonymous , and they should be discussing the same things . 	0
WTP	26256	As long as the lead touches on the origins of the church ( and I think it does ) , then the origins section can go in History , where it fits . 	1
WTP	26257	The paragraph on the church mission could fit very well into the beliefs section , or go lower in the article . 	0
WTP	26258	This is now very well explained in the article , just not at the beginning . 	0
WTP	26259	The term has been removed from the article . 	0

WTP	26262	I ' m not an apologist for BP , who should pay every penny they owe and then some , and may well do so , but I am trying to use the record to correct the recounting of the way the newsiness has unfolded , or the abbreviated version of such , neither of which is remotely encyclopedic . 	0

WTP	26285	It doesn ' t matter what you put here , they will run you around with their own biased logic as to why it isn ' t " reliable " . 	1
WTP	26286	Burying Mission in Church will really make that important paragraph obscure and placing origins in hisory will make that paragraph disconnect with Beliefs for which it is a logical precursor based on Jesus promise to St Peter " What you bind on Earth will be bound in Heaven " . 	0
WTP	26287	These two items : Origins and Mission relate to the current activity of the church in the world today - not just history and thus they cant be considered history alone . 	1
WTP	26288	Also , I want to add that I thought all of Karanacs comments on Peer Review were fine with a couple small exceptions and I plan to address all of them eventually . 	0
WTP	26289	The logic flows well since you have the church being founded and its mission defined which directly affects the formation of its Beliefs . 	1
WTP	26290	It tells the reader the Why . 	0
WTP	26291	The church operates its many churches , missions and social ministries around the world today in response to a Gospel event discussed in the Mission paragraph . 	0
WTP	26292	Answering the question of Where did it come from is one of the first questions readers will have about the church - see the FA on Islam which actually puts the answers to this question in the lead and expands on it there as well . 	0
WTP	26293	Origins tells the reader Where did it come from which I think is an important question to answer up front since the Gospel passage in the origins section is the basis for the church existence . 	0
WTP	26294	The plans were later shelved following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill , the worst oil spill in US history . " 	1
WTP	26295	It would seem to me not unreasonable to add one sentence under Domestic policy that says something like , " Obama introduced a proposal to expand areas open to off-shore drilling on March 31 , 2010 [ 45 ] . 	1
WTP	26296	I am OK either way . 	0
WTP	26297	I think the lead is just supposed to be a brief summary of what is in the aritcle and can ' t possibly include everything so we can use our judgement on issues like this . 	1
WTP	26298	That sentence is also in the Beliefs section under subsection " church " . 	0

WTP	26300	Your point may be valid in a few hundred years at the least , when continuous demographic changes will finally have an impact . 	0
WTP	26301	But to say it now is jut ridiculous . 	0
WTP	26302	Multiple users have agreed with me on this point , so I encourage you to expand your horizons a bit — realize there are more specific articles on WP than this one about the First Vision and how Smith was treated in the 1830s — and target your edits about specific details to articles that are about the specific events . 	0

WTP	26308	People had donkeys and horses strung to carts and some who could afford it boats - - travelling a few hundred miles was equivalent to flying from London to Australia back and forth ten times . 	0
WTP	26309	My great granfather used to tell me that a whole village would come to say farewall to people travelling a distance between London and Edinburgh . 	0
WTP	26310	I agree that the Lebanese do get ahead of themselves claiming to be direct descendants of Pheonicians but to be fair , they are the closest to make that claim as do most semites in the region ( regardless of what DNA tests suggest ) . 	0
WTP	26311	It might be notable , and if so , its existance would seem relevant here . 	0
WTP	26312	Works for me . 	0
WTP	26313	While massacres and atrocities were wrought by the crusaders , nowhere does it say that the Church called for or encouraged these massacres but just the opposite - they were appalled and the massacres worked against the goals of the church . 	0
WTP	26314	Not much more than " it exists " is relevant here , so a wikilink would be the way to go . 	1
WTP	26315	There were no criticisms of the Catholic Church in Latin America - every book spoke of the Church taking a stand in every age against the abuses brought upon the people by the Spanish conquistadores and others . 	0
WTP	26316	However , I was surprised myself that what I thought had been the case in these events was actually not what historians thought . 	0
WTP	26317	We have not introduced POV into this article , I intended in every way to show the bad things done by the church throughout the ages in history . 	0
WTP	26318	I agree with Xandar , - As the person who has researched these events extensively using our scholarly works cited , our aritcle represents the view held by scholars . 	1

WTP	26322	Additional interpretation from the guardian link above : " The fact that he compared his desired option - the elimination of " the regime occupying Jerusalem " - with the fall of the Shah ' s regime in Iran makes it crystal clear that he is talking about regime change , not the end of Israel . 	0
WTP	26323	Two of our best scholarly works ( including Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity ) had whole paragraphs , one had half a page discussing how the evils of the Inquisitions have been overblown and they were not as bad as we have been led to believe . 	0

WTP	26355	Even then it ' s bound to be controversial , so the category should be left out . 	1
WTP	26356	Again , you ' re incorrect about how you ' re characterizing my edits , even as your own edits bespeak a lack of understanding of ( or a lack of focus on ) the issue . 	1
WTP	26357	The " an oil rig " wording was not created by my edit , it was created by yours . 	0
WTP	26358	http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barack_Obama&diff=prev&oldid=367249190 My wording had been " exploded a Transocean drilling rig " until Scjessey ' s complaint the section was too long after which I reduced it to " exploded a Transocean rig " , which you changed to " exploded an oil rig " , which , as I ' ve already established , created an entirely new link leading to a disambiguation page . 	0
WTP	26359	As to your point about piping , I think your attitude is a little dismissive and your focus a little myopic . 	0
WTP	26360	I maintain that finding a Deepwater Horizon link within the phrase " a blowout exploded a Transocean drilling rig " is as intuitive as the example of an appropriate link at the Wikipedia : Piped link # Intuitiveness page you link for me as a tutorial , finding " Pontiac ' s Rebellion # Origins " linked within the phrase " war launched in 1763 by a loose confederation of elements of Native American tribes " . 	0
WTP	26361	Now you ' ve changed it to " an explosion destroyed an offshore rig drilling for oil " , with no link at all , again , as if you ' ve got better things to do than properly edit this featured article . 	0
WTP	26362	( If you thought it worth a link before , why not now ? ) 	0
WTP	26363	The rig was not drilling for oil when it was destroyed by the explosion , as your edit makes it sound . 	1
WTP	26364	In fact , the drilling had completely ceased , or the cementing wouldn ' t have commenced 20 hours earlier ; in fact , the rig was basically done there , and about to undergo a routine check before unhitching from the well site and making way to another drilling location . 	0
WTP	26365	I take it you ' ve not caught much C-SPAN these past six or seven weeks ? 	0
WTP	26366	Please continue to accurately relay that the UN said the statement was a clarification and not a " backing down " or however it was characterized in the press . 	0
WTP	26367	Also , the article should note that the IDF itself stated that it had fired at school premises in early reports on the matter , for example here , and your own BBCNews citation states that Israel had first stated that its mortars had caused " carnage _at_ Fakhura school " ( emphasis added ) . 	1

WTP	26380	Getting back to the original point , I think there is a problem in how the sentence infers that these specific bands were reviled by critics , when the point is supposed to be metal as a whole was derided . 	0

WTP	26474	The book talks about 386BSD in quite a bit of detail and the fact that Linus was aware of it at the time on p65-67 and Linus is quoted as saying " if 386BSD come out a year earlier , I probably wouldn ' t have started Linux " . 	0

WTP	26480	I don ' t really have too much of a problem with this dead-soldier ( though again a more " neutral " John-Doe-on-morgue-slab would be better ) . 	0
WTP	26481	If you want to put up a morgue or med-school shot of some anonymous " John / Jane Doe " corpse , I ' d probably be okay with that ( depending in that case however entirely on how likely it seems that some reader out there might be surprised and disturbed to see a deceased relative or loved-one representing this topic - - which again is just another aspect of the same reasoning and in the same way something that Wikipedia probably ought to avoid here . . . ) . 	0

WTP	26484	The lead image should be a good representation of the subject of this article . 	0
WTP	26485	As far as my " disapproval " of the dead-Pope image ( and " similarly " the dead-soldier image ) : it ' s not squeamishness , it ' s just the same reason why I thought the painting would be more " appropriate " here cropped down to just the skull . 	1
WTP	26486	That ' s all . 	0
WTP	26487	Choosing a lead image that also contains representations of the subjects of other articles weakens the effect , is distracting , is potentially confusing , and depending on the " other subjects " in question might easily be interpreted as editorial bias ( to the extent , in the case of the Pope , for example , of possibly causing offense to some readers ) . 	0
WTP	26488	As to taking it out all together and placing it in First Vision wiki article remember : King George , The British Empire . 	0

WTP	26492	My comments about using McBrien have only to do with his perception among the Catholic community as being somewhat of a rebel theologian and it is difficult to have his books listed in the beliefs section for that reason . 	0

WTP	26502	Part of the problem in real life ( not saying it ' s here ) is that some want to defend Obama so much that they think he abandoned the church and want to wipe it out . 	0

WTP	26515	There is no scandal here in the UK despite many journalists looking for one . 	0

WTP	26526	There are more proofs and evidence suggesting that the content is groundless and untrue manipulated by the current Iran ' s government to justify Ahmadinejad ' s preseidency given that Iranian people have respect and tendency towards educated candidates . 	0
WTP	26527	Thus claiming a ranking system in 1976 , 2 years prior to the revolution , is untrue and groundless . 	0
WTP	26528	Prior to the revolution in Iran in 1978 , each university has its own entrance exam and no ranking system even existed . 	0
WTP	26529	This was the time that the nationwide entrance exam was started as a sample of equity and justice . 	0
WTP	26530	The entrance exam and the ranking system started in 1986-1987 and after the universities re-openned . 	0
WTP	26531	5 ) Iranian universities were closed from 1980 to 1983 due to the post-revolution anarchy . 	0
WTP	26532	4 ) Even if Ahmadinejad had taken the entrance exam in 1990 with almost double population than his time in 1976 , he would have ranked among 150 , 000 and not 400 , 000 ! ! ! 	0
WTP	26533	This is based on capacities as well and the data could confirm the fact that Iranian universities have considerably higher capacities for medical and social sciences than engineering programs . 	0
WTP	26534	The statistics shows that almost always 1 / 5 apply to engineering programs , 2 / 5 social sciences and 2 / 5 medicals . 	0
WTP	26535	It ' s clear they will never admit it , so it has to be highlighted publicly . 	0
WTP	26536	Yeah , there are so many double standards on this article , and this website in general that it would take a massive overhaul of the whole system to clear out the bias of these " editors . " 	0
WTP	26537	Yes , we shouldn ' t base our information on sources that are biased in the other direction . 	0
WTP	26538	On the other hand , a quick glance here shows no mention that there is currently any link between the AGI and PPFA , nor that there has been since 1977 , when " the Alan Guttmacher Institute was incorporated as an independent , not-for-profit organization " . 	0
WTP	26539	There is no vandalism . 	0
WTP	26540	Unless you have some to back up your assertions , this discussion is a dead end . 	0
WTP	26541	" Constant internet debate " is irrelevant here . 	1
WTP	26542	Only reliable secondary sources matter . 	0
WTP	26543	This is heading in an unnecessary and unproductive direction . 	0
WTP	26544	In general , our articles about politicians try to avoid sections devoted to criticism , and avoid criticism generally , because criticism is not really a pertinent biographical fact about people unless it is tied somehow to their life . 	0
WTP	26545	Sometimes a person ' s detractors , or problematic things about them or their actions , are of biographical importance , and they can be included . 	1
WTP	26546	For example , in his book Obama recounted drug use in his youth , something that is a significant part of his life story . 	0
WTP	26547	We don ' t call it a criticism or a controversy , it is simply an event that happened . 	0
WTP	26548	Another thing we avoid is trying to balance articles about people against each other so they are equally or positive or negative . 	1
WTP	26549	It just doesn ' t work like that - we would have to calibrate Obama ' s article against not only other presidents , but all of his political rivals , those of heads of state of other countries , and so on . 	0
WTP	26550	And to what end ? 	0
WTP	26551	It is not our job here on this page to clean up the Bush article or speculate about what makes Bush a controversial figure , but if it is misfocused you are free to go there and try to improve it . 	0

WTP	26558	As far as I know the term is a concise encapsulation of the Church ' s stance on these issues . 	0

WTP	26567	Therefore , it should not be in such a visible article . 	0
WTP	26568	It is clear that anyone not living in Israel would not correctly interpret this picture . 	0
WTP	26569	The patrol is in the territories , so the locals would obviously be settlers , but this is not about " cooperation with settler groups " . 	0
WTP	26570	From what I can tell from the picture , it ' s a joint patrol / weapon unloading by the IDF and local security forces , and this has nothing to do with the " settlement movement " or anything of the sort . 	0
WTP	26571	The above comment shows exactly why this picture shouldn ' t be in this article , as it can be broadly , and incorrectly , interpreted . 	1
WTP	26572	The object of a " theory " is to enduce debate , which in turn stimulates research and which in return bears fruit in the form of a " fact " , creativity is more important that knowledge ( " Einstein " ) . 	0

WTP	26575	Catholic Charities is one of the largest charities in the United States , I think it is in the top ten - per a Forbes article referenced on its wikipedia page . 	0
WTP	26576	I would also like to point out that the good things the church does - its current missions , orphanages , schools , universities , Catholic Charities and Catholic Releif Services only get passing mention with no elaboration on the vast number - millions of people helped by the church currently each year . 	0

WTP	26578	While the LGBT population of San Francisco is certainly one of its most internationally recognizable elements , it is one aspect of the many things that are recognizable about San Francisco and should probably be included in the lead , I would prefer that all the items listed there maintain a parallel structure . 	0
WTP	26579	The final paragraph in the lead does not need to have an overly technical representation of the gay and lesbian population of San Francisco . 	1
WTP	26580	The section has been treated no differently than any other paragraph that has contained criticism of the church . 	0
WTP	26581	Entropy1 , don ' t let me discourage you from trying to improve this article , but in this case I think you are trying to introduce conclusions that are not supported by mainstream scholars , including Mormon mainstream historians like Richard Bushman . 	0
WTP	26582	But the proposed material here , such as the newspaper articles , is not appropriate in this article . 	1
WTP	26583	The First Vision is a very important part of post-1900 Mormonism . 	0
WTP	26584	if the tone of my edits was not neutral ( this is how X is called by Y ) , or if my attempt to clarify the reasoning of ( X ) why it / they use this name were offending , then that should be discussed on this page or modified accordingly in the article ! 	0
WTP	26585	but it was removed and the removal reasoning was not clarified here and the discussion was left open because chose not to take part of the discussion ! 	0
WTP	26586	in that sense the article is not balanced , although i would say that as far as i can see , it does not introduce false information , but it defiantly shuts off a whole perspective of it ! 	1
WTP	26587	I agree . 	0
WTP	26588	It requires that all majority - and significant-minority views be presented fairly , in a disinterested tone , and in rough proportion to their prevalence within the source material . " , the last post in the discussion ( before my responses regarding the discussion ) was by Sean . hoyland , i confirmed to the constructive input that shows that no one but i agrees that the term IOF should be used in the intro , it is clear that this term is not welcomed by some editors , and seems offensive to some , never the less , it still represents a major perspective that the article is completely ignoring ! 	0
WTP	26589	regardless whether we agree on it or not ! 	0
WTP	26590	Can you please clarify how i am vandalizing the article ? 	0
WTP	26591	but lets not get drifted off the topic here , i will quote " The neutral point of view is a means of dealing with conflicting perspectives on a topic as evidenced by reliable sources . 	0
WTP	26592	Though I deeply respect my former professor Anderson , I don ' t think we can make much use of his BYU Studies article in Wikipedia , given that no non-Mormon scholar agrees with the underlying conclusion of his article . 	1
WTP	26593	frankly I ' m offended by you calling my edits vandalism ! 	0
WTP	26594	but i would rather keep the discussion revolving around the core issue of this discussion . 	0
WTP	26595	Thus , Obama ' s and most other Democrats pages stay clean . 	0
WTP	26596	They simply put you , me or anybody else who tries for a legitimate edit , through what is obviously a run-around , until we give up . 	0
