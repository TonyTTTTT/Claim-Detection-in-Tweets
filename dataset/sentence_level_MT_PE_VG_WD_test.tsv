MT	0	That ' s costly ! 	0
MT	1	Fees result in longer durations of studies . 	0
MT	2	Studying and taking higher degrees must remain a basic right for everyone . 	0
MT	3	Tuition fees should not be charged in Germany . 	1
MT	4	Supermarkets and shopping centres should be allowed to open any Sundays and holidays at their discretion . 	1
MT	5	For in this way , Sunday shopping days would be better spread out through the year . 	0
MT	6	Also streets and shops would presumably be emptier as not everyone would be open on the same day . 	0
MT	7	However then you ' d have a worse overview of which shop is open on a given day . 	0
MT	8	Courts are also subject to human error . 	0
MT	9	No human being or human committee should again be given the permission to rule over ' life or death ' . 	0
MT	10	Every human , even those who have committed a despicable crime , can bring themselves to regret and change their opinion . 	0
MT	11	That ' s why Germany should not introduce capital punishment ! 	1
MT	12	A door must remain open for making amends . 	0
MT	13	Of course there are a number of programmes in public broadcasting that are not worth the licencing fee , and others , such as “ Musikantenstadl ” and soap operas , are only interesting to certain audiences . 	0
MT	14	Nevertheless , everybody should contribute to the funding of the public broadcasters in equal measure , for we need general and independent media . 	1
MT	15	After all we want to get our view of the world neither through the lens of the government nor through that of rich media entrepreneurs . 	0
MT	16	Their tools , data and expertise have been used to keep us under surveillance for a long time . 	0
MT	17	Having said that , state funds are often wasted on nonsensical investments , so that this ideal appears unworthy of support in many ways . 	0
MT	18	Besides , the trading of information is obviously driven by greed of gain . 	0
MT	19	It is desirable that no one channels his or her wealth past the tax authorities . 	0
MT	20	Those who do or try to should be held accountable if at all possible . 	0
MT	21	Tax data that are not made available for free should therefore not be acquired by the state . 	1
MT	22	Despite the severe clashes in Kiev , which at times have threatened to escalate , the EU should not intervene in local politics . 	1
MT	23	Although Ukraine is a European country , and the Ukrainian opposition is primarily interested in installing a robust democracy , possible supporters face a considerably stronger opponent in the intervention of Russia in local politics . 	0
MT	24	It doesn ' t matter after all that those who administer the treatment don ' t have ' doctor status ' . 	0
MT	25	Besides it should be in the interest of the health insurers to recognize alternative medicine as treatment , since there is a chance of recovery . 	0
MT	26	Alternative treatments should be subsidized in the same way as conventional treatments , since both methods can lead to the prevention , mitigation or cure of an illness . 	1
MT	27	Since however skat , chess etc . are not accepted as Olympic events , computer games should also not be recognized as Olympic events . 	1
MT	28	Our society is strongly digitized and influenced by computers . 	0
MT	29	Yet sports are usually associated with physical training . 	0
MT	30	Olympic events are rooted in old traditions . 	0
MT	31	On the other hand , the events have a culturally determined character . 	0
MT	32	The statutory health insurance companies should also cover treatments with non-medical and alternative practitioners . 	1
MT	33	Their treatment methods and successes are not amply researched or proven . 	0
MT	34	Yet many patients subjectively experience relief or are cured of their complaints , which ultimately also saves costs for conventional treatments and medication . 	0
MT	35	Also conventional medicine is in many cases not successful , and , moreover , entails significant risks and side effects . 	0
MT	36	To oblige non-academics to finance others ' degrees through taxes , however , is not just . 	0
MT	37	As long as it is ensured that the funds really benefit the universities directly , one can continue to regard this as social justice . 	0
MT	38	Actually it would be justified if all German universities charged tuition fees . 	1
MT	39	It ' s always possible to take out a student loan or to earn a scholarship . 	0
MT	40	Those who study later decide this early on , anyway . 	0
MT	41	Granted , those concern primarily the British and American intelligence services , but the German services evidently do collaborate with them closely . 	0
MT	42	Intelligence services must urgently be regulated more tightly by parliament ; this should be clear to everyone after the disclosures of Edward Snowden . 	1
MT	43	' Property entails commitment ' is one of the tenets of our social order . 	0
MT	44	Everyone should be able to get the utmost profit from his or her property . 	0
MT	45	A fixing of rent prices according to the market alone , however , will lead to a further division of society . 	0
MT	46	The rich and poor live in different neighbourhoods . 	0
MT	47	A constant increase in rent upon a change of tenants hence cannot be desired by society . 	1
PE	48	For the above reasons , I agree that distance education can ' t replace traditional school . 	1
PE	49	To begin with , going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language . 	1
PE	50	In March 2003 , a lab technician shot a video inside a lab , which revealed primates in cages without pain medication , for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head . 	0
PE	51	Recent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly , which influences their reactions to drugs . 	0
PE	52	Some people choose to be normal to wait for chances , while some other people prefer to be different from everyone else . 	0
PE	53	Which one is the promising way to succeed ? 	0
PE	54	As living in a competent world , we are like playing a survival game . 	0
PE	55	Consideration is always important in relationship . 	0
PE	56	In the meantime , communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate . 	1
PE	57	Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine . 	0
PE	58	For example , roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time . 	0
PE	59	Much has been said about the importance about good roommates and how roommates will affect our life in school . 	0
PE	60	Roommates quality and their importance 	0
PE	61	In my personal opinion , the most important quality of roommates is being considered . 	1
PE	62	Research showed that friends that we made in university are more likely to be life time friends and this especially applicable to roommate . 	0
PE	63	Therefore , having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life . 	1
PE	64	At all times , think about the other ' s feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously . 	0
PE	65	If there are more people in the cities , there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road , which causes air pollution . 	0
PE	66	Additionally , it might put strain on the environment . 	0
PE	67	In my opinion , however , I do not approve of this trend due to negative effects such as low quality of life and affecting the environment . 	1
PE	68	In conclusion , young people tend to study or work in urban areas since these provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials . 	1
PE	69	Secondly , animals are kept in unnatural conditions . 	0
PE	70	Animal testing costs an enormous amount of money , since they must be fed , cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances . 	0
PE	71	Every year , cosmetic companies , farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products , without any beneficial result . 	0
PE	72	Perhaps the most serious problem facing the animals ' rights today is animal experimentation . 	0
PE	73	For example , if someone tells a kid that something is wrong and they shouldn ' t do it , but his father told him / her that it was right , the kid will listen to the father instead of the other person , even if his father is wrong . 	0
PE	74	More power than any friend or other adult could have . 	0
PE	75	They have more contact and more intimacy with their children . 	0
PE	76	Secondly , a child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people , so their parents have more time to teach him / her than anybody else . 	1
PE	77	I completely agree that parents are the best teacher . 	1
PE	78	Parents are the best teachers because they are more special than everybody else 	0
PE	79	Firstly , the things that parents say have great power to their child . 	1
PE	80	Children normally think that their parents are somehow special and that makes them the most important people in the children ’ s lives . 	1
PE	81	That ’ s as important thing because even if the parents don ’ t intend to teach their children something , they are always observing and learning by themselves . 	0
PE	82	Lastly , children usually mirror themselves on their parents . 	1
PE	83	Moreover , parents provide their children the best social skills and knowledge in order to prepare for their children ' s future life . 	1
PE	84	It is obvious that parents are the first teachers who teach babies how to walk and speak and make children to become a good person . 	1
PE	85	If you want to stay healthy , be yourself and spend time with your family and friends , then you should spend less time watching these media . 	0
PE	86	Television and movies nowadays contain a lot of advertisements . 	0
PE	87	These advertisements build ideal images that make people to feel bad about themselves and want to be more like these images . 	1
PE	88	They communicate less with their parents because a lot of their time is used watching television and movies . 	0
PE	89	When people are watching television or movies together , they also talk less to each other , compare to when playing social games , such as parlor games , together . 	0
PE	90	When a cool hero characters in a movie smokes and yet a lot of people like him , then people who idolize him may also begin to smoke although they don ’ t prefer it . 	0
PE	91	I think television and movies are entertaining but most of the time they influence people ’ s behavior in bad ways . 	1
PE	92	When people see beautiful women and men on the advertisements , they think that they are ugly . 	0
PE	93	Thus they spend a lot of money to buy a lot of beauty products or go to gym to get better appearance or body . 	0
PE	94	Admittedly , the government should give priority to public services and facilities . 	0
PE	95	This is because the government plays the role of a leader among citizens , which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable . 	0
PE	96	Simultaneously , public services such as education system or medical care can meet people ' s basic demand of survival , security and knowledge , thus making them feel comfortable , which can lower the crime rate . 	0
PE	97	Therefore , public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability . 	1
PE	98	Government should spend money on ARTs , not only on public services 	0
PE	99	As people have raised their democratic awareness in recent years , they are caring more about how the tax expenditure is distributed by the government . 	0
PE	100	As a result , some people suggest that the tax money should be allocated to publically beneficial services instead of arts . 	0
PE	101	However , from my perspective , I think arts are supposed to be included in the government ' s investment as well . 	1
PE	102	On the other hand , I believe arts should by no means been disregarded by the government . 	1
PE	103	Individually , arts can enrich people ' s cultural lives . 	0
PE	104	Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards . 	0
PE	105	For example , the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams . 	0
PE	106	Fossil fuels will soon be replaced ? 	0
PE	107	Although renewable resources of energy are elements of the current and future energy strategy , as far as I ' m concerned , these new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases , oil , and coal . 	1
PE	108	Firstly , due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive . 	1
PE	109	Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford . 	0
PE	110	On the other hand , fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas . 	0
PE	111	For example , it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy , say expensive solar batteries and wind farms . 	0
PE	112	Thus the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming . 	0
PE	113	Besides , although utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly ; these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think . 	1
PE	114	In other words , I think the best way of communication is by means of face-to-face . 	1
PE	115	Based on the reasons demonstrated above , I prefer to express my opinion in person because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite . 	1
PE	116	Talking without scruple is not the indispensable part in communication ; in contrast , it is usually detrimental to us . 	0
PE	117	It is conceivable that before we talk , it is necessary for us to be imprudent about our words . 	0
PE	118	Still , I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent . 	0
PE	119	It is not to say , of course , that other points of view are completely without merit . 	0
PE	120	Development through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors , lawyers or engineers . 	0
PE	121	Basic education teaches one child to read and write . 	0
PE	122	Supplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information . 	0
PE	123	A further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self-sufficient . 	0
PE	124	A well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment . 	0
PE	125	In the same way , a skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society . 	0
PE	126	Collectively , the benefits of education can make a man , a society and a developed country . 	1
PE	127	In conclusion , education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country . 	1
PE	128	The more people in the country become educated , the better chance it can develop . 	1
PE	129	Businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life 	0
PE	130	Many entrepreneurs hypothesize that it is safer to hire employees for their entire lives in order to ensure the productivity and efficiency of working . 	0
PE	131	From my perspective , those assumptions are not only conservative but also out-of-date . 	0
PE	132	First and foremost , various ideas and creativity from different people are indispensable for a company to flourish . 	1
PE	133	Therefore , the youngsters are capable of meeting those standards . 	0
PE	134	More importantly , they have activeness , inventiveness and enterprise which allow them to complete their jobs perfectly . 	0
PE	135	These vital factors can decide whether the company can thrive or not . 	0
PE	136	Thus , easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human ' s health . 	1
PE	137	Are museums necessary ? 	0
PE	138	In order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits , museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing . 	1
PE	139	However , people may not get a spiritual experience since pictures online are only limited to a screen size . 	0
PE	140	Third , it is clear that parents are ones who loves their children most and always take care of their children . 	0
PE	141	In conclusion , parents are really the best teachers who give us much knowledge and advice . 	1
PE	142	Based on love , they always try their best to make good condition for their children development in order to prepare children ' s future life . 	0
PE	143	Unfortunately nowadays most of them pick up this profit without sharing a small sum of it with their workers , and from my point of view it is unfair . 	0
PE	144	What is more , when people work for themselves they make more profit for themselves , but in the other jobs you make profits for the other such as your manager . 	1
PE	145	You always have to be responsible for your task , and it make a stressful situation that I never like it . 	0
PE	146	In your job you can be boss of yourself ; however , in the other jobs someone else are your boss . 	0
PE	147	In the first place , there are a large number of opportunities in privat works that you cannot find them when you work for the others . 	1
PE	148	There are many benefits when people work for themselves rather than work for the others . 	0
PE	149	Although both companies have their advantages and disadvantages , I would prefer to work for myself , and have my own business . 	1
PE	150	Some of them are done by companies that related to government , and some of them are done by privat companies . 	0
PE	151	There are many kinds of jobs in society . 	0
PE	152	Some prefer to work for a company , some prefer to work for themselves 	0
PE	153	In other words , reducing risks and enhancing individual ' s capability is the most important path to success . 	0
PE	154	Based on the reasons demonstrated above , I believe that doing what we already known can still leads us to succeed because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the opposite . 	1
PE	155	Still , I am firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent . 	0
PE	156	It is not to say , of course , that other points of view are completely without merit . 	0
PE	157	Therefore they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living . 	1
PE	158	Obviously , many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career . 	0
PE	159	There can be no doubt that the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities . 	0
PE	160	TV has adverse effects on friends and family 	0
PE	161	I know someone who wakes up in the morning and before even eat he turns the television on , he even records the programs he cannot watch during work hours . 	0
PE	162	Some People spend a lot of time watching television , others even eat watching television , and some others make of this media a priority . 	1
PE	163	Sometimes his wife wants to talk before they go to work , but he only let her talk during commercials . 	0
PE	164	People have a lot of things to learn in their lives . 	0
PE	165	Therefore , I agree that Television has destroyed communication among friends and family . 	1
PE	166	One of this resource is television ; however television has some negative effects among some people . 	0
PE	167	Nowdays there are different resources to entertain , educate and inform people . 	0
PE	168	First of all , some people spend a lot of time watching television . 	1
PE	169	So , she is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email . 	0
PE	170	Firstly , education is an essential part in development . 	0
PE	171	This will be proven by analyzing the necessity of developing their education and the real objective of supporters . 	0
PE	172	As I have said , television is a great tool to learn , entertain and inform what is happening , but I agree that television has destroyed communication among friends and family as soon as television become a priority , spend a lot of time watching it and eat in front of the television . 	1
PE	173	For instance , most developing countries are lack of educational resources , such as experienced teachers , evaluation systems and teaching facilities , which is usually neglected by local authorities . 	0
PE	174	In most countries , it makes up a considerable part of its national budget yearly . 	0
PE	175	Education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country 	0
PE	176	There are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities . 	0
PE	177	In a developing country , not many can afford to send their children to school . 	0
PE	178	These children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen , can hardly eat three meals a day , let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday . 	0
PE	179	As a result , these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents . 	1
PE	180	Education is undeniably an economic necessity . 	0
PE	181	I believe that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country . 	1
PE	182	The lower the factors making us fail we have , the higher probability to success we own . 	0
PE	183	I favor the latter ; that is , successful people still do things they already know . 	1
PE	184	The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that to be successful , we all try to reduce the risk we might encounter . 	0
PE	185	Some people tend to believe that to be successful , they should do something they are unfamiliar with , while others seem to stand on the opposite place . 	0
PE	186	After deeply pondering over this issue , I develop my own perspective as well . 	0
PE	187	Successful people do something new or take risks 	0
PE	188	There is a hotly debated issue over whether successful people usually take risk or try new things , and the topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity . 	0
PE	189	He can focus on certain companies which he thinks is worth it to invest , and then just waits for the not so high but constant income . 	0
PE	190	He does not have to invest some dangerous companies to get higher profit which might lead him to bankrupt in a short time . 	0
PE	191	While if you " visit " the museum online , you may not able to get this kind of experience . 	0
PE	192	For example , at American Museum of Natural History , you can make a bone-by-bone reproduction of the museum ' s stegosaurus ; at Museum of Art in New York , you can look at 17th century instruments while listening to their music . 	0
PE	193	I believe public museums and art galleries will still be necessary , even though we can see the art works and historical objects online . 	1
PE	194	Prepared Food 	0
PE	195	Nowadays , more and more people begin to select prepared food as their daily meals , since it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society . 	1
PE	196	However it is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients , ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people ' s eating habits . 	1
PE	197	In this essay , I would like to explain why this is not a good thing based on the three reasons above . 	0
PE	198	First of all , to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious , almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people . 	0
PE	199	Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences . 	0
PE	200	Also , when there is a dinner with friends , some people do not have a fluid conversation because the television is again in between them . 	0
PE	201	This is the time , when if they have children , they can share everything about school , a project and even concerns . 	0
PE	202	Another way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family . 	1
PE	203	Time with the family is gold , some people have to realize that and take quality of time to talk to them . 	0
PE	204	Honestly , I was in shock ! 	0
PE	205	I remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night . 	0
PE	206	Finally , some people make the television a priority . 	1
PE	207	When family or friends gather together to have a good time eating and talking , this is not the reality in some cases . 	0
PE	208	People cannot live a harmonious life if citizens do not have a decent place to live in . 	0
PE	209	If the price of housing grows continuously , a comfortable place to live in will be a luxury to the middle class and the low class . 	0
PE	210	What government should take into consideration at the first place should not be historic and traditional building preservation but new building construction . 	1
PE	211	How she could say that to me ? . 	0
PE	212	And the cost of accommodation keeps growing these years . 	0
PE	213	The necessity of governmental financial aid is extremely important . 	0
PE	214	New building construction hold the right to gain more money from government 	0
PE	215	The housing shortage is drawing more and more attention nowadays . 	0
PE	216	Then , ordinary people , especially the younger generation , will fall into a certain pattern - work , pay bills for housing , work ; and I am sure that it will increase people ' s dissatisfaction of the government . 	0
PE	217	Because when they are working , the fair of losing their accommodation always lingers , which will limit their efficiency . 	0
PE	218	In highly industrialized countries , undertakings are made to make it accessible and affordable to all . 	0
PE	219	They are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands . 	0
PE	220	For example , I have a close friend who was in the same department with me in the university . 	0
PE	221	Thus renewable resources are not as reliable as we think . 	0
PE	222	Admittedly contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain , deduction of ozone layer and global warming ; these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions . 	1
PE	223	This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds . 	0
PE	224	More importantly , the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up ; leaving problems for the following generations . 	0
PE	225	With these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable . 	0
PE	226	In conclusion as promising as renewable resources of energy sound , there is no way those new forms of energy will replace fossil fuels soon . 	1
PE	227	For example we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain . 	0
PE	228	These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy . 	0
PE	229	As an engineering researcher , I will surely be disappointed for failure , and exited for new challenges . 	0
PE	230	Just like a song , if I did not have challenge , life would be blue . 	0
PE	231	Doing different tasks makes employees and employers much happier . 	0
PE	232	While when it comes to " happier " , different type of jobs can be responsible factor . 	0
PE	233	Although they can be familiar with their job , changing of job is what serve to their happier . 	0
PE	234	Workers , who work for an ordinary company or industry , will be sick of same tasks day by day . 	0
PE	235	To set another example , consider every workers have ability to do several kinds of work , employers will be satisfied by the generating benefits . 	0
PE	236	Changing the type of work will be fresh and elicit their potential to adapt a new environment , which , according to psychology theories , makes workers relaxed and happier . 	1
PE	237	Different types of tasks during workday brings more challenges , making life colorful . 	0
PE	238	They both will be happy because the change of job , not the same task day by day . 	0
PE	239	These examples make it obvious that great achievement needs someone keen on one task for long time . 	1
PE	240	Gandhi devoted his whole life to fight against British-ruled government and inspire movements for civil rights in India , finally he became the father of the nation . 	0
PE	241	Most of workers have adapted to do same task . 	0
PE	242	While there are innumerous people will deem it ridiculous and argue doing the same task is the meaning of job , but from my perspective , I am on the side of my father . 	0
PE	243	As a authoritative dentist in my province , my mother has worked for 25 years . 	0
PE	244	It allows us to achieve more . 	0
PE	245	In my family , the argument topic between my father and mother always involves my father ' s job . 	0
PE	246	Different types of tasks endow more colors to our life 	0
PE	247	Every time I asked him why , he will say , seriously , " I am done , doing this same work for 20 years and I really want to try some different , that is all . " 	0
PE	248	Five years ago , he quitted his 20 years job as an architectural engineer , and became a landscape painter . 	0
PE	249	Studying alone at home might deprive us of these significant and valuable opportunities . 	0
PE	250	For example , students may learn how to cooperate with classmates from teamwork . 	0
PE	251	We can learn a lot from programs at home ; however , our computers or televisions can ' t teach us how to get along with people . 	0
PE	252	Furthermore , there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization - establishes relationship with classmates . 	1
PE	253	If you are the type that gets easily distracted , a distance-learning program may not be for you . 	0
PE	254	Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision . 	1
PE	255	Unlike traditional classes , distance education courses don ' t take place in a classroom , where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates . 	0
PE	256	Second , studying at home is very different from traditional learning . 	0
PE	257	Unfortunately , it may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help . 	0
PE	258	Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects . 	1
PE	259	Besides , in the far future , they become more valuable . 	0
PE	260	On the other side , most sports facilities except buildings are usually can be used in short-time and they are not persistent for a long-time . 	0
PE	261	To conclude , there are good ways for sports activities to compensate their expenses , but it is very hard for libraries to find a good way for have an income . 	1
PE	262	Last but not least , investing in libraries has a long-time result . 	1
PE	263	For example , a library can buy a lot of new books or they can buy more computers . 	0
PE	264	Most of the library facilities are stable and you can use them for a long time . 	0
PE	265	Most libraries are free not for students also for public . 	0
PE	266	Hence , universities support is vital for libraries . 	0
PE	267	But sport activities have a good income because every sport has different matches and for each match they have a lot sponsors . 	0
PE	268	Also , they have this chance to sell their important matches tickets . 	0
PE	269	To begin with , outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage . 	1
PE	270	Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached . 	0
PE	271	Besides , it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done . 	0
PE	272	To be precise , such abstract or complicated informatin , easily absorbed by those students , may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills . 	0
PE	273	Universtiy is an entrance to life . 	0
PE	274	University education restriction 	0
PE	275	It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people . 	0
PE	276	It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed . 	0
PE	277	However , university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills . 	0
PE	278	University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain . 	0
PE	279	Consequently , we should pay more attention to adjust people ' s behaviors in order to reduce crimes instead of gun control . 	0
PE	280	On the other hand , criminal mind seems to be more related to violence . 	1
PE	281	All in all , it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate . 	1
PE	282	They should try and keep trying until they learn what they want to learn . 	0
PE	283	People should not depend only on reading or listening to people talking about things to learn . 	0
PE	284	The history shows that learning by doing things is the best way and the best method to learn things . 	1
PE	285	As studies have shown that the rate of obesity in children has increased every year , it will be very beneficial for children to have a daily physical activity and get a break from being sitting several hours at school . 	0
PE	286	Physical activity helps children to grow up physically healthier . 	1
PE	287	Daily exercise will help also to develop children ' s brain function . 	1
PE	288	In addition , exercise will help them to not be less exposed to illness related with cardiovascular , higher blood and cholesterol issues . 	0
PE	289	Although some people believe that students should spend the whole day on academic studies , I nevertheless believe that physical exercise is a crucial part of every school day . 	1
PE	290	Physical exercise should be required part of every school day 	0
PE	291	In addition , including exercise in children ' s daily routine , it is a good way to teach them the importance of physical activity from an early age . 	1
PE	292	Exercise is good not only for having a good health body , but also for the mind . 	1
PE	293	When people exercise , the respiratory system ' s function is enhanced , helping all organs , including the brain , to get more oxygen in . 	0
PE	294	It is well known how important it is to exercise regularly to help the body system to work better . 	0
PE	295	Once you are unique enough , you are already on the way to success 	0
PE	296	Achieving success is everybody ' s goal for life and there are absolutely many different directions that can lead people to success . 	0
PE	297	In my opinion , I believe that once you are unique enough , you are already on the way to success . 	1
PE	298	First , being positively different from everyone else usually means that you ' ve achieved something that is superior than others . 	0
PE	299	Consider a circumstance in which one person is rich because he knows a lot of knowledge of investment . 	0
PE	300	We can browse the art work from all over the world at home . 	0
PE	301	Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work because the Internet really brings them convenience . 	1
PE	302	First , children are taught basic things , which influence their whole life , by their parents . 	1
PE	303	Are parents best teachers ? 	0
PE	304	Consequently , parents bring the whole world of wonderful and colorful thing into their baby ' s little mind . 	0
PE	305	Second , parents train their child how to become a good person . 	1
PE	306	As a baby , they do not know any thing all around but they learn everything from their parents . 	0
PE	307	Parents always try to explain and describe tenderly all things in simple way so that their baby can understand and learn from that . 	0
PE	308	They always make their children basically say thanks and apology in the right way . 	0
PE	309	On the one hand , it is common that they try to explain who is a good or bad person . 	0
PE	310	For example , only when we see the real mummy , can we experience mystique . 	0
PE	311	Therefore , if a government wants to control crime in a community , it is important to manage their people ' s actions rather than gun used in violent crimes . 	1
PE	312	As a result , the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself . 	0
PE	313	By contrast , the exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling . 	0
PE	314	First of all , it seems to be true that if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease because fewer guns available mean less crime . 	1
PE	315	To some extent , I do not agree with this assertion because I believe that criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control . 	1
PE	316	Some people may argue that allowing policemen to carries firearms can increase violence in the society . 	0
PE	317	Gun control and increasing violence 	0
PE	318	Moreover , there will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world , either polices or common citizens . 	0
PE	319	People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns , regardless of gun control . 	0
PE	320	In fact , stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally . 	1
PE	321	However , this is not as simple as it sounds . 	0
PE	322	In addition , it is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world . 	0
PE	323	Thus , the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid . 	0
PE	324	As is commonly understood , there is an increasingly gap between developed countries and developing countries . 	0
PE	325	Financial aid to develop countries 	0
PE	326	However , it is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries . 	1
PE	327	It can be seen that some developed countries and organization are proving financial assistance to the impoverished countries . 	0
PE	328	From this example , it is obvious that if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education , the developing countries will remain undeveloped , even though they gain a great deal of economic support . 	1
PE	329	For instance , there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases . 	0
PE	330	Not cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition . 	1
PE	331	It is true that cooking prepared food needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food . 	0
PE	332	I believe that the brilliant bosses are conscious of the need for giving opportunities to diverse employees . 	1
PE	333	Firstly , international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country ’ s economy in order to serve various demands of tourists . 	0
PE	334	While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries , I would contend that it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations . 	1
PE	335	The last decade has seen an increasing number of tourists traveling to visit natural wonder sights , ancient heritages and different cultures around the world . 	0
PE	336	International tourism is now more common than ever before 	0
PE	337	Secondly , through tourism industry , many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected . 	0
PE	338	Therefore tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country . 	1
PE	339	These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard . 	0
PE	340	Take Cambodia for example , a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants , hotels , souvenir shops and other stores . 	0
PE	341	Without this support and profit from tourism , many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works . 	0
PE	342	For instance , in Vietnam , many cultural costumes and natural scenes , namely ‘ Trong Dong ’ drum performance and ‘ Ha Long ’ bay , are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry . 	0
PE	343	Building more accommodating constructions meets people ' s basic need . 	1
PE	344	In this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self-study . 	0
PE	345	Finally yet importantly , appearing in class makes students more conscientious since they have to obey class ’ s disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments . 	1
PE	346	However , if they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems . 	0
PE	347	Another significant fact which should be taken into consideration is that by the help of teachers , students can understand ideas faster and easier since teachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points . 	1
PE	348	First and foremost , I truly believe that being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college . 	1
PE	349	Also , they can help each other for learning materials better . 	0
PE	350	On the contrary to this popular belief , there are still those who subscribe to this view that having a choice for attending classes enable students to study at home and through this way they do not waste their time for commuting and also they can save their money . 	0
PE	351	However , I am inclined to believe that being present at classes seems a wiser option . 	1
PE	352	Students should attend to classes or it should be optional ? 	0
PE	353	Nowadays , it is often claimed that attending classes has a lot of benefits for students and provide them with a variety of learning opportunities ( options ) as well . 	0
PE	354	Television and Movies influence our lives both negatively and positively 	0
PE	355	There is no doubt that television or movies influence people ’ s behavior and they influence us in both bad ways and good ways . 	0
PE	356	But I think in general television and movies influence our behavior in bad ways more than in good ways . 	1
PE	357	They make people to eat more rubbish food , spend less time with their friends and family , and be someone that are not themselves . 	1
PE	358	There are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television . 	1
PE	359	Most of the foods they eat are fat foods like chips or pizzas . 	0
PE	360	It is not rocket science to know that these foods are not good for people ’ s health . 	0
PE	361	Many companies know about this behavior and use advertisements on television to make people buy more of these foods . 	0
PE	362	In turn , people will consume these rubbish foods more and we have to deal with a lot of fat diseases . 	0
PE	363	Television and movies also make people to spend more time on their couch than with their family and friends , especially children . 	1
PE	364	Of course , effective cooperation can make things easier and faster , but in many important cases when team-working is not possible , the ability to work alone will help . 	0
PE	365	What is more , the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry . 	0
PE	366	There is no deny that the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture , real estate industry and industry , in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy , because they produce plenty of profits . 	0
PE	367	First , land used for farmland , housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society . 	0
PE	368	The reasons are based on the following aspects . 	0
PE	369	As far as I am concerned , I agree with the opinion human needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important . 	1
PE	370	People who disagree with the point dispute that the decreasing of land for endangered animals will bring damage to ecological balance . 	0
PE	371	Nowadays , there is a prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals . 	0
PE	372	Farmland , housing and industry or saving land for animals ? 	0
PE	373	Thus the needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important . 	1
PE	374	It is widely acknowledged that more farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate . 	0
PE	375	In conclusion , working with a group a people and working individually are all important . 	0
PE	376	Both skills are necessary for a successful life . 	0
PE	377	Nevertheless , the capablity of working alone is the foundation for the skill to work in team and plays a significant role in a lot of situations . 	1
PE	378	Working in team does not mean that you do not have to come up with your ideas . 	0
PE	379	Everybody in a team must have his / her own opinion first , then discuss them with other members . 	0
PE	380	When we work in team , we still think individually because our brain are not connected but separate . 	0
PE	381	When everyone in a team can come up with his / her own ideas , working in team will definitely more effective . 	0
PE	382	More convincing 	0
PE	383	There is a hotly debated issue over whether face-to-face communication is better than other kinds of communication , and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity . 	0
PE	384	Some people tend to believe that communication in person is the best way of expression , while others seem to stand on the opposite position . 	0
PE	385	After deeply pondering over this issue , I also develop my own perspective . 	0
PE	386	I favor the former ; that is , I agree that face-to-face communication is better . 	1
PE	387	The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that communicating in person can be more convincing . 	0
PE	388	He once complained a service of a restaurant . 	0
PE	389	Without exaggeration , he directly went to the boss and told the boss that something wrong occurred on the meal--a fly concealed in it . 	0
PE	390	Afterward , my uncle acquired a new service thanks to face-to face communication . 	0
PE	391	Some details might be dim since the resolution ratio of the screen is not high enough . 	0
PE	392	What ' s more , not all the details of the artwork can be shown on the computer screen . 	0
PE	393	For instance , you can ' t see the texture of the artwork which is very important to study the skills used by the artist . 	0
PE	394	Seeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes . 	1
PE	395	In conclusion , I believe we still need museums and art galleries but computers can be introduced to museums and galleries in order to help visitors to know more about the art works or historical objects . 	1
PE	396	These may influence the comprehension of the art work or historical objects . 	0
PE	397	Extraordinarily cautious is important since rough work is intolerable 	0
PE	398	This current world we situate ourselves in is rather unpredictable , even one sudden invention could bring down all the notions we used bear in mind . 	0
PE	399	Most of us has endeavored to keep up with the pace of the development of today ' s world in fast pace . 	0
PE	400	I personally believe that even when fast pace may be the wise move to correspond with today ' s world . 	1
PE	401	However , it might not be the most beneficial move to our society . 	1
PE	402	Primarily , even when the world operates in fast pace , it still requires accuracy . 	1
PE	403	Even simple issues in our daily life like homework require accuracy . 	0
PE	404	If we rush through the work by taking risk of making mistakes , we are actually making zero effort going through our study roughly only for the purpose of fill in before the deadline . 	0
PE	405	In short , it only fulfills the work itself which is rather worthless . 	0
PE	406	It is our capability of work that we should improve rather than holding the belief in completing it . 	0
PE	407	Unlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines , traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat , laugh and cooperate face to face . 	0
PE	408	As a result , communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more . 	0
PE	409	Furthermore , it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today . 	1
PE	410	In fact , these traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children ' s skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices . 	0
PE	411	By contrast , modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits . 	0
PE	412	Therefore , there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents , such as violence or pornography , arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival . 	0
PE	413	Thus , I would conclude that traditional games should be , by no means , ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games . 	1
PE	414	Only through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process . 	1
PE	415	For the reasons mentioned above , it seems to me that testing on animals has no clear result and consequently , it should be made illegal . 	1
PE	416	Take the most popular and prestigious technology company - Apple - for example . 	0
PE	417	Second , being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others . 	1
PE	418	In other words , once you are special and unique , pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you . 	0
PE	419	In conclusion , being different and unique is the better way to achieve success . 	1
PE	420	It not only shows your competence but also creates your own value , making you take the lead in your way towards success . 	1
PE	421	It has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers . 	0
PE	422	In conclusion , there are many valuable factors about roommate that are important . 	0
PE	423	Through communication , bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others . 	0
PE	424	However , people might not get what they want all the time . 	0
PE	425	Consideration and communication , in my personal opinion , are the most important quality . 	1
PE	426	For the above reasons , if we have a chance to visit top museums in the world , we must stop by these museums . 	1
PE	427	During our trip , it is worthwhile for us to visit a museum of a new place . 	1
PE	428	Moreover , a local museum could be a top choice and destination for tourist to visit . 	1
PE	429	Someone take a trip without making any plans , so they may waste their time on shopping or staying at their hotel . 	0
PE	430	As a result , visiting a museum saves their precious time for making a decision . 	0
PE	431	Most important of all , a local museum represent its own typical culture so that visitors may easily acquaint with the new place in a short time . 	0
PE	432	Although sport is important , it does not have the same priority of library has . 	1
PE	433	In addition only small part of students attend sport activities . 	0
PE	434	First , I think a library is vital and strategical part of a university . 	0
PE	435	All professors and students need to have a modern and well-equipped library because , after internet , library plays an important role in research . 	1
PE	436	Most university rankings pay attention to quality of these two activities . 	0
PE	437	In my opinion universities should invest in libraries more than anywhere else . 	1
PE	438	Universities should give money to sport activities or libraries 	0
PE	439	Libraries and sports activities play important roles in universities success . 	0
PE	440	For example , in my university number of students who use the library is much more than students do sports activities . 	0
PE	441	Second , usually libraries do not have income . 	0
PE	442	The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose . 	1
PE	443	At the increasing living pace , the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes . 	0
PE	444	Whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need , especially for children who are growing up . 	0
PE	445	Cooking is not a waste of time , contrarily , it is crucial for our health and culture . 	0
PE	446	But rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits , which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking . 	0
PE	447	In conclusion , although the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work , it is not a good thing . 	1
PE	448	In conclusion , even though the people from older generation may claim they had better life as there were stronger bonds between family members and friends , I think they are wrong , since they judge the contemporary age through a personal prejudice . 	1
PE	449	In light of the above-mentioned facts , one can easily conclude that in the current world living standards stand in a much higher level and people are in better conditions socially and physically . 	1
PE	450	To be specific , scientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body , which is a miraculous breakthrough . 	0
PE	451	In general , the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine . 	1
PE	452	Today , even some disabled people with serious vertebral injuries can start doing physical activities like walking again thanks to the continuingly efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists . 	0
PE	453	The advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives . 	0
PE	454	These days , there are increasing numbers of young people from the countryside moving to cities in search of jobs and educational opportunities . 	0
PE	455	Young people move to cities 	0
PE	456	To begin with , the major cause that leads to urban migration of young adults is that cities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas . 	0
PE	457	Personally , I think it has some drawbacks that will be discussed in this essay together with some reasons about this . 	0
PE	458	However , this phenomenon sometimes poses several negative consequences . 	0
PE	459	For example , if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work , he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time . 	0
PE	460	As a result , cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation . 	1
PE	461	There are several reasons why animal testing should be banned . 	1
PE	462	Many medical treatments have been discovered by animal testing , including cancer and HIV drugs While most scientists claim that this is vital for improving human health , I believe that primates should have the same rights as human beings . 	1
PE	463	Testing on animals and keeping them in unnatural conditions 	0
PE	464	She learned quickly and understood everything in class so fast . 	0
PE	465	Thus , she rarely went to class but spent most time to understand confusing topic . 	0
PE	466	Student can also study by themselves in the library and focus on only the topic they do not understand . 	0
PE	467	I think going to classes should be optional for students for the following reasons . 	1
PE	468	Firstly , the reason why university students should not be required to attend class is sometimes the students in the university can learn better from other sources outside the class room . 	1
PE	469	However , class is not the only source of knowledge . 	0
PE	470	Students also learn from other sources such as experience , libraries and other people . 	0
PE	471	Attending university classes should be required or optional 	0
PE	472	On the other hand , children are shown how to behave well with others . 	0
PE	473	This seems to be easy but this can influence positively their future children and makes children ' s behavior better before they face the real world . 	0
PE	474	Thus , they tend to provide the best knowledge and advice from their experience for children . 	0
PE	475	Unlike a professional , parents always support children and give them much social skill so they can communicate well with others and have good habit in life . 	0
PE	476	I personally believe that human beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual . 	1
PE	477	Many people agree that it is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals , but also misleading , since animals and people ' s response to a drug can be different . 	0
PE	478	There is also the argument that many ethical and genetic principles are broken when testing on animals . 	0
PE	479	Consequently , I think that sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity . 	1
PE	480	In fact , parents ' support is one factor which makes people succeed in their life . 	1
PE	481	I am biased towards the opposite side that businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life because of the three main crucial reasons . 	1
PE	482	The invaluable experience of senior employees can pass down to the young apprentices who get used to new job , but regularly give out creative and novel ideas . 	0
PE	483	What ' s more , the rapid development in every field nowadays requires precise updates and access to new knowledge . 	0
PE	484	Attending university ' s classes is one of activities that students have to do . 	0
PE	485	All in all , I agree that parents are the greatest teachers and I think that they should be very careful with what they say and do in front of their child , because it can define who he is going to be . 	1
PE	486	So , if there is a man that beats his wife and treats her bad , his child probably is going to be rude and treat girls bad . 	0
PE	487	Also , attending to classes makes students more attentive and have them to do their studies on time that this attitude lead them to success . 	1
PE	488	However , the ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times . 	0
PE	489	Through this way , they may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study . 	0
PE	490	On the basis of the points mentioned above , I convinced that communicating and studying with peer group is a good way for learning materials . 	1
PE	491	Moreover , teachers have a conspicuous role in assisting students for learning materials that being present at classes is a requisite for benefiting it . 	1
PE	492	If you don ' t make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others , you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you . 	1
PE	493	Take myself for example , when I was in college , I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report because I was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently . 	0
PE	494	The number of individual who enroll in university are enormous , more than any school one person have studied . 	0
PE	495	Thus , students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation , even from the whole world . 	1
PE	496	For instance , my brother are studying in an international university with a mixed community include Vietnam , Brazil , Argentina , etc . And he told me that he is very excited for experiencing such new environment , which is one of his main purposes when attending university . 	0
PE	497	Last but not least , preparing for career is an essential function of university . 	1
PE	498	Students not only do homework , assignment and attend class but also need to participate in volunteer work , internship and part time job . 	0
PE	499	Thus , they can have some experiences in the outside world and discover what their life goals are . 	0
PE	500	After all , they know where and what to put high emphasis on in order to achieve their objectives . 	0
PE	501	In summation , people may attend university for various reasons . 	0
PE	502	Some want to enjoy new experiences , some are going to prepare for their future career , while others are eager to develop their understanding . 	0
PE	503	Even though the purposes could be various , everybody who is studying in university should concentrate on the objectives and try their best . 	1
PE	504	Only who has the sharpest weapon can survive . 	0
PE	505	As far as I am concerned , I strongly believe that online classes should never replace classroom learning . 	1
PE	506	I list my reasons as follows . 	0
PE	507	Classroom learnng vs online education 	0
PE	508	There are some people who believe that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning while there are some people who strongly disagree with this opinion . 	0
PE	509	For example , When I was in First Year in B Com , I was not serious in my study , but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me , it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects . 	0
PE	510	Finally I got 1st rank in final exam . 	0
PE	511	First , indeed classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes . 	1
PE	512	In the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates , because if you see any of your classmates who is performing better , it will force you for making your performance more better . 	0
PE	513	And it has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation . 	1
PE	514	Indeed , they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas . 	0
PE	515	This means some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market . 	0
PE	516	In conclusion , financial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries . 	1
PE	517	Therefore , developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries . 	1
PE	518	In my opinion though , social networks such as Facebook could foster the ties between friends and family members who are obligatorily far away from each other by keeping them in touch , the thing that was impossible less than 20 years ago . 	0
PE	519	The phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human being to make the world a healthier and , thus , a happier place to live in . 	0
PE	520	A clear-cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones . 	0
PE	521	The strong navigation system installed on the phones has been rescued lives of many who left alone in remote areas like forests or deserts . 	0
PE	522	Do you believe that elderly people used to live in a better world ? 	0
PE	523	Changes are inseparable parts of this world which normally humans are responsible for by manipulating the environment they live in . 	0
PE	524	Sometimes these changes adversely affect our lives that make elderly people think they used to live in a better world than the modern world the younger generation are experiencing . 	0
PE	525	I utterly disagree with this opinion due to technological and medical reasons . 	0
PE	526	However , according to my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence . 	0
PE	527	Try something new can indeed make people become special , while it does not mean successful . 	0
PE	528	The same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm . 	0
PE	529	In contrast , those athletes try to have distinctive performance by taking risks of taking drugs are failed to succeed . 	0
PE	530	Hence , from this case , we are capable of stating that it is not necessary for successful people to take risks . 	1
PE	531	Admittedly , on the other hands , there might be some dissidents proclaiming that doing something new is necessary for people to success because they can become different from others , which is also a widely accepted idea for success . 	1
PE	532	Therefore , we can commence to agree that successful people do not have to try new things or take risks . 	1
PE	533	Moreover , another equally crucial aspect is that it depends on the capability of one to decide whether he can succeed or not . 	0
PE	534	At least , a successful person should be able to dismantle the hurdles prohibiting him to success . 	0
PE	535	For instance , the sports stars do not have to take some drugs to win a game or show their extraordinary skills . 	0
PE	536	This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable . 	0
PE	537	I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages . 	0
PE	538	As far as my opinion is concerned , I find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power . 	1
PE	539	The topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate with proponents maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy while opponents argue that atomic technology is uncontrollable and very dangerous to handle . 	0
PE	540	The nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy 	0
PE	541	Another reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity . 	1
PE	542	If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage . 	0
PE	543	Last century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons . 	0
PE	544	First and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons . 	1
PE	545	Firstly , the costs outweigh the benefits . 	0
PE	546	For example , everyone around me speaks foreign language , and then I have to improve myself to communicate with people . 	0
PE	547	Knowing foreign language is became more and more important in this time . 	0
PE	548	Learning a foreign language in my own country or another country 	0
PE	549	There are two options to learn foreign language . 	0
PE	550	Many people pursue to study foreign language . 	0
PE	551	The second option is that go to study in another place that foreign language are spoken . 	0
PE	552	First is stay in homeland to study foreign language . 	0
PE	553	I will give reasons to support my opinion . 	0
PE	554	Going to another place to learn language is better choice . 	1
PE	555	As a result , I spent the time of biology class to do my Chemistry research and got A + for both biology and chemistry . 	0
PE	556	In conclusion , I think the students should know what activities they should do at the time and have good management for their learning time . 	1
PE	557	Also , they have to know how to deal with the effects from not attending classes . 	0
PE	558	So that , attending classes in the university will not be required to the students anymore . 	1
PE	559	Finally , she got very good grade when she was graduation . 	0
PE	560	Secondly , students should not be required to attend classes because they can manage the time spending on classes to do other benefit things if they already understand topic in the class very well . 	1
PE	561	In my experience , many times I did not attend biology class because my university does not require the students to attend classes . 	0
PE	562	Also , I had already studied all biology topics before attending university . 	0
PE	563	In my city , National Palace Museum is celebrated for collection of ancient Chinese artifacts . 	0
PE	564	To my astonishment , Jadeite cabbage is the most famous artistic work , which is made of jade , is vividly shown . 	0
PE	565	Secondary , visiting a well-known museum also can broaden our horizon . 	1
PE	566	Those outstanding and diverse range of objects , with classic and magnificent art , is guaranteed to inspire us ! 	0
PE	567	Through the exhibit , I found that the Statue of Liberty symbolized freedom , and Ellis Island may be the place , where the immigration took their dreams and fears . 	0
PE	568	Thus , museums can help us know the history and the customs of a new place . 	1
PE	569	Primary , it is easy to know the history of the new place . 	0
PE	570	Last year , I went to Ellis Island and the immigration museum , where is a symbol of American immigration and the immigrant experience in the New York . 	0
PE	571	Why people visit museums ? 	0
PE	572	As a lover of travel , a quintessence of any visit to an excellent museum of a new place would be the best part of a tour , which can be explained by the following reasons . 	1
PE	573	Meanwhile , children ' s access to the celebrities news on the media should be restricted and they should study only from the celebrities who can act positively . 	0
PE	574	In conclusion , media should shift its focus from covering celebrities to elsewhere . 	1
PE	575	This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material . 	0
PE	576	Further more , they will not value other people ' s hard work and take everything for granted . 	0
PE	577	This gives children the idea that it is not necessary to study hard at school for a better career and earning a living . 	1
PE	578	It is not uncommon to see on the media that some of them are committing to crimes or misbehaving such as being addicted to drugs or alcohols , having messy sex lives . 	0
PE	579	Meanwhile , not all celebrities are role models . 	0
PE	580	Celebrities , for example movie stars , are usually seen on media living a luxury life or having a new girlfriend , etc . It is human nature that people , especially youngsters , are attracted to the celebrities they favour , and that is why the media prefer to cover as much news of the celebrities as possible . 	0
PE	581	Drugs , alcohol and messy sex lives 	0
PE	582	The first impression of the celebrities seems that they are rich while not having to work hard . 	0
PE	583	But I tend to think that this is a worrying tread which has negative impact on children . 	1
PE	584	Of course , some celebrities , e . g . writers , passionate entrepreneurs are good examples to children for they share fascinating stories or how to pursue their goal by doing something that has a meaning to them and may change the world . 	1
PE	585	Worse still , without proper parenting , children may perceive that this is the cool life people are supposed to be living . 	1
PE	586	Moreover you can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others . 	0
PE	587	It makes you communication and of course your group skills better , which can help you in your future and career . 	0
PE	588	Third , professors play vital role in classroom learning , most of them are specialists is their subjects , and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills . 	0
PE	589	You can improve your skills by work under any professor ; you can ask questions face to face , it will clear your doubts . 	0
PE	590	In result you learn quickly . 	1
PE	591	For example , I have my personal experience . 	0
PE	592	For Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses , but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT , and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster . 	0
PE	593	It ' s undeniable that online classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary , but they could not be substitute of existing classroom learning . 	1
PE	594	From the discussed above , we can easily draw the conclusion that the classroom learning is the best way to provide education for these reasons . 	1
PE	595	New challenges from different tasks amounts far more than more works , it also means through dealing with it , I will obtain more knowledge and experience . 	0
PE	596	As the saying of a Chinese writer , the color of life is rooted not in Japanese cherry blossom or Canadian maple leaf , but rather there always exists new things and challenge . 	0
PE	597	After all , doing same task day and night just server to increase our psychological burden , connecting with different types of job is capable give us more colors to our life . 	1
PE	598	To sum up , I admire my father ' s choice , while the same task give us opportunities to be an expert , like my mom , I still hold the firm view that different types of tasks endow more colors to our life . 	1
PE	599	Having children in the daily exercise routine from an early age will teach them the important value of having physical activity in their every day routine . 	1
PE	600	Daily exercise will provide children with a mental break which will boost them to be efficient learners . 	0
PE	601	Moreover , they can stick with the routine and make the daily physical activities a good habit on their whole life . 	0
PE	602	Children are bombarded with lectures about nutrition and physical activity ; however , they will be more beneficed if that knowledge can be put in practice . 	0
PE	603	It will meliorate not only mental and body health , but also will establish in children a habit of doing it , giving them the opportunity to measure the worth of including such an important activity in their daily live schedules . 	1
PE	604	Including physical activity in children ' s school day should be strongly considered . 	1
PE	605	Instead of spend time with family and friends , they like to seat on a chair for hours . 	0
PE	606	Learning foreign language form another country is better choice for me to study language . 	1
PE	607	Besides , in foreign country I could have a chance to speak foreign language with my friends . 	1
PE	608	Thus , I could talk with my friend without worrying about speaking wrong . 	0
PE	609	The only language that I could talk to make friends is English language . 	0
PE	610	In conclusion , I personally believe that learning language from foreign country is better than learning language in home country because I have to improve myself to communicate with other people . 	1
PE	611	This reason makes me have a progress in foreign language faster . 	0
PE	612	This environment makes me want to develop myself to be able to communicate with people that speak foreign language . 	0
PE	613	If I could not communicate with other people , I could not even buy food to sacrifice my hunger . 	0
PE	614	For instance , English school in outside my home country , there are many people that come from different places and from different languages . 	0
PE	615	Secondly , having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster . 	1
PE	616	Different people attend university for different point of views . 	0
PE	617	In my perspective , the three most reasons are increased knowledge , career preparation and new experiences . 	1
PE	618	Concentrate on the objectives - people attend schools for various reasons 	0
PE	619	From many centuries ago , universities have been playing an important role in ones ' life . 	0
PE	620	Thus , people are able to strengthen their knowledge . 	0
PE	621	Moreover , through the instructions of teachers , the sufficient infrastructure such as laboratory , library , students is capable of doing research on every academic aspect . 	0
PE	622	First of all , for most people , university is an ideal place for them to develop their understanding . 	0
PE	623	Truthfully , in this wonderful academic environment , everyone is provided with varieties and gigantic number of information by a lot of professors and well-trained teachers . 	0
PE	624	Therefore , they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying . 	1
PE	625	Secondly , studying in university means that you have totally turned into a different page of your life , which included many new experiences . 	0
PE	626	Testing is a very important aspect of life , and still the majority of tests do not allow you to work in team . 	0
PE	627	What is more , there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people . 	1
PE	628	Therefore , it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people , who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively . 	1
PE	629	In conclusion , university restriction has both pros and cons . 	1
PE	630	Apart from the disheartened ones , many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs , mostly the white-collar ones . 	0
PE	631	That ' s why it should be made available for a wide range of learners . 	1
PE	632	In my opinion , it will yield more negative results than positive ones . 	0
PE	633	They are critical part of universities and a good university has to have a modern library . 	1
PE	634	In spite of the importance of sports activities , libraries are more important . 	1
PE	635	Second , in classroom learning you have to complete study work on time . 	0
PE	636	It makes you perfect in time management skills . 	1
PE	637	Pupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click , such as science reports , study posts , documentary records , etc . A student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule so he can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course . 	0
PE	638	It is undeniable that traditional education has its advantages in face-to-face communication , mental inspiration and physical educations . 	1
PE	639	Distance-learning cannot bring the benefits that traditional colleges offer 	0
PE	640	With the tremendous development in information technology , long-distance education enables people to study at home without going to school . 	0
PE	641	Whether this teaching approach is more beneficial to pupils than the traditional way sparks off a heated debate . 	0
PE	642	From my perspective , I agree with the view that students can acquire more benefits from the remote education . 	1
PE	643	To begin with , studying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense . 	1
PE	644	Students who use distance-learning programs can cut down their commuting time , tuition fees , textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection . 	0
PE	645	This especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far-off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty-line . 	0
PE	646	Besides that , long-distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches . 	1
PE	647	However , if you aren ' t extremely dedicated or have good time management skills , it may be very difficult to complete a course at home . 	0
PE	648	You can study any time you want . 	0
PE	649	In addition , you could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course . 	0
PE	650	The biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day . 	0
PE	651	Studying at home by using technology is convenient . 	1
PE	652	Here are my reasons . 	0
PE	653	I don ' t think that technology can replace teachers and classroom . 	1
PE	654	Study at home by using technology / study or traditional school 	0
PE	655	Especially when you don ' t have an instructor there to guide you , it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements . 	0
PE	656	First , attending an education course at home requires persistence and patience . 	0
PE	657	Sometimes , face-to face communication can lead us to convince or complain someone successfully , and a fitting example can be found from my uncle . 	0
PE	658	We live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light , steering the world toward a much more convenient place . 	1
PE	659	The fact of doing things by ourselves can help us to get some experiences that would strong our maturity . 	0
PE	660	For example if some one wants to learn how to be a leader , they have to experience this by being in a real situation of leading a team or a group , or even a situation . 	0
PE	661	There are a lot of reasons to recommend this method for who is serious about learning some thing in their lives . 	0
PE	662	First of all , learning by doing things develops our maturity . 	1
PE	663	When you do things by your self , you learn to depend on yourself . 	0
PE	664	You will not be in need to refer to books or persons . 	0
PE	665	People learn in different ways and what teaching method do you prefer ? 	0
PE	666	They use several ways to broaden their knowledge and their skills . 	0
PE	667	One of these several ways of learning that I prefer is doing things by my self rather than learning by reading about things or learning by listening to people talking about . 	1
PE	668	Moreover , some people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face-to-face communication . 	0
PE	669	Admittedly , on the other hand , there might be some dissidents proclaiming that communication by letters , email , or telephone can enable them to talk without scruple , which is also one of the most important parts in communication . 	1
PE	670	However , from my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying . 	0
PE	671	Apart from the one I have mentioned above , another equally crucible aspect is that it is easy to be deceived without face-to face communication . 	0
PE	672	For instance , I had received some harmful words on facebook from my best friend , Eric . 	0
PE	673	If he just wrote something to complain on the website or by telephone , I do not think this problem would be thought important . 	0
PE	674	Therefore , we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way . 	1
PE	675	Finally , I realized that his facebook account was stolen . 	0
PE	676	Hence , from this case , we are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face-to-face . 	1
PE	677	He said that I was totally failed in building a good friendship and he did not want to be one of my friends anymore . 	0
PE	678	I just shocked and did not know what happened . 	0
PE	679	Learning by doing things gives us more and more pleasure especially if we success in learning perfectly this things . 	0
PE	680	So we become motivated to learn other things by doing them . 	1
PE	681	Another reason that makes learning by doing things more advantageous than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about is that we find more motivation to continuing on learning by doing things . 	0
PE	682	With the time , Reading about things or listening to people talking about could become more and more boring . 	0
PE	683	People who want to learn how to swim have to go to the beach or to the swimpool and laid themselves in the water to feel and know what is swimming . 	0
PE	684	Nor listening to people or reading about can teach them swimming . 	0
PE	685	There are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them . 	0
PE	686	Reading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing . 	0
PE	687	We can not be leaders by reading books or by listening to person talking about leading . 	0
PE	688	Secondly , learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about . 	1
PE	689	In addition , the authorities should adequately support these sustainable developments . 	0
PE	690	To conclude , as far as I am concerned , international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries . 	1
PE	691	Thus , tourism has survived many non-tangible cultural values and beauty scenes . 	1
PE	692	In conclusion , I concede that traditional education has some merits like feedbacks and inspirations that cannot be replaced in the near future . 	1
PE	693	However , distance-learning outweighs the conventional way not only with its efficiency , convenience and economic value , but also with the self-regulated education that pupils can study on their own purpose . 	1
PE	694	These make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils ' personalities . 	0
PE	695	But with the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies , remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts . 	0
PE	696	To sum it up , from above mentioned facts it can easily be deduced that nuclear power may appear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages . 	1
PE	697	Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it . 	1
PE	698	Last but not least , while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power . 	0
PE	699	Thus I suggest that use of nuclear technology should be discouraged even for civil purposes . 	0
PE	700	They have more opportunities , profits , and authorities . 	1
PE	701	There is no doubt that working for the other have some advantages , too , but I imagine people that have their own business are more comfortable . 	1
PE	702	For all of them we have to ask for a permission , and most of the time we are not allowed . 	0
PE	703	Sometimes some occasions happen to people for example a disease , sticking in a traffic jam and sometime going on a vacation . 	0
PE	704	When you work for yourself you can punch in and punch out whenever you want . 	0
PE	705	Finally , there are some authorities in privat jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others . 	1
PE	706	Furthermore , the factories and companies will have abundant human sources to ensure the pace of manufacture and also devising lots of unique ideas . 	0
PE	707	In a nutshell , varied characteristics of various people , feeling tired of having the same occupation and solving the unemployed problem drive me to agree with the statement that the employer should not hire the staff for a whole life . 	1
PE	708	Thereafter , the bulk of them realize that high promotion and competition can assist them to improve their skills and horizons also . 	0
PE	709	Many people enjoy challenging them because they don not want to be monotonous and passive ones . 	0
PE	710	Secondly , the staff soon gets boring with their stable job in such a long time . 	1
PE	711	At a certain time , they may presume that a securing job is the most important and necessary because they need to earn money to manage their life . 	0
PE	712	In my opinion , the businesses ought to recruit many workers so as to tackle this aching issue . 	1
PE	713	It enables the jobless to better their life and earn a living . 	0
PE	714	The same-old-same-old environment soon makes them depressed , so this situation will have an adverse impact on the enterprise . 	0
PE	715	Last but not least , the economic crisis and financial recession result in a tremendous increase in unemployment . 	0
PE	716	For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area . 	0
PE	717	In addition , cooking is one of arts humans create . 	0
PE	718	The reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors . 	0
PE	719	It is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value . 	0
PE	720	Moreover , communication is as well making a good roommate . 	0
PE	721	It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member . 	0
PE	722	One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project . 	0
PE	723	People have different habit in daily life , such as tidy the blanket in the morning . 	0
PE	724	Therefore , communication is very important as it would clear up the misinterpretation . 	1
PE	725	If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk . 	0
PE	726	The sky is the limit ; there are all kinds of personality out there . 	0
PE	727	We need to be flexible to be account into society . 	0
PE	728	However , I think traditional games are still indispensible in children ' s learning process , even much more essential than modern games , especially in modern society . 	1
PE	729	One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children ' s communication skills . 	0
PE	730	With technological advances , children have more access to modern games currently . 	0
PE	731	In such case , the relative importance of traditional games and modern games in children ' s developments of skills has become a frequent topic of discussion . 	0
PE	732	Traditional games or modern games in developing children ' s skills 	0
PE	733	Games have played a key role in children ' s growth , especially in terms of their abilities . 	0
PE	734	This is because children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games , which , in fact , helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future . 	0
PE	735	At the same time , children have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology , raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative . 	0
PE	736	For me , I believe parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games . 	1
PE	737	It is true that modern games may be , to some extent , beneficial for children to foster some skills , such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend . 	1
PE	738	All in all , protecting endangered animals is necessary , nevertheless , human needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important . 	1
PE	739	For instant , we can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct . 	0
PE	740	With the economy development , we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals . 	0
PE	741	According to the discuss above , agriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy . 	0
PE	742	Last I want to mention is that even though farmland , housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals , it can do good to protect the endangered animals . 	1
PE	743	In addition , highly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life . 	0
PE	744	Especially in some poor areas , survival is the most significant thing . 	0
PE	745	It is clearly understood that farming , housing and industry provide us the food we eat , place we live , clothes we wear , which are essential to live . 	0
PE	746	Second , farmland , housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life . 	1
PE	747	Let ' s imagine that you perform really well when you can discuss the problems with other people , but you have no experience of working alone , standardized tests such as SAT , TOEFL may be your nightmares . 	0
PE	748	The apperant example is that there are a lot of tests that do not allow team-working . 	0
PE	749	Working in team is a necessary skill that every individual must master for success . 	0
PE	750	Despite the importance of working in team , I still believe that the capability of working independly is more significant . 	1
PE	751	Work in team or independently 	0
PE	752	Nowadays , as the world is getting smaller , we need to be able to cooperate . 	0
PE	753	In such circumstances , even when the scientists want to finish off quickly , but they couldn ' t miss even a single part of the mission since it may trigger loads of problems . 	0
PE	754	To sum up , even when we need to catch up with the pace of the world , it is necessary for us to be extraordinarily cautious since rough work is intolerable when we want to stay competitive . 	1
PE	755	Even when we managed to keep up with the pace by neglecting the details of a project and only aim for a general frame of the project , this will not be something satisfy for the company and clients . 	1
PE	756	We soon will be out of the picture even when we kept up with the pace since when the problem reveals itself we ' ll have to go back and fix the mistakes we have made . 	0
PE	757	Certainly it may take time to keep up with the others if w need to review our work multiple times , but with consistent work soon enough we ' ll be able to bring up our speed in completion of work . 	0
PE	758	Secondly , other than the importance of accuracy , the world also seeks efficiency , which concludes both minimum time completion and also criterion of quality . 	0
PE	759	Some work cannot tolerate any mistakes at all , for instance , in official missions like the work done by NASA , a tiny mistake can be catastrophic . 	1
PE	760	A miscalculation of the orbit in launching rocket may lead to a failure of the whole project which might worth trillions of dollars . 	0
PE	761	This might be even more costly and time consuming than a neat completion of work at the start . 	0
PE	762	Besides , when looking at this problem within a broader image . 	0

PE	765	In this view , arts serve cultural and economic purposes . 	0

VG	855	So the doctrine of justification by faith , which has strong support in the Christian scriptures , leads inevitably to exclusivism , to the idea that all who reject Christian doctrine must be damned , no matter how good they may be , by ordinary standards . 	1

VG	934	It is crucial that this specialized form of bankruptcy relief for family farmers not be allowed to sunset for two fundamental reasons . 	1
VG	935	First , family farmers , absent chapter 12 , would be forced to file for bankruptcy relief under the Bankruptcy Code ' s other al-ternatives , none of which work as well for them as does chapter 12 . 	0
VG	936	Chapter VII of the Bankruptcy Code , for instance , would require a farmer to liquidate ; that is , sell the family farm to pay the claims of the farmer ' s credi-tors . 	0
VG	937	Many farmers would be precluded from choosing bankruptcy relief under chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code be-cause of its restrictive eligibility standards . 	0
VG	938	Furthermore , Chapter XI , the Bankruptcy Code ' s business reorga-nization alternative , is not farmer-friendly in various respects , as it often entails an expensive and time-con-suming process that does not readily accommodate the special needs of farmers . 	0
VG	939	Second , recent statistics dem-onstrate that there is not only a con-tinuing need for chapter 12 , but that this need is apparently increasing . 	0
VG	940	Ac-cording to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts , chapter 12 bankruptcy filings jumped by more than 62 percent over the past year . 	0

VG	984	Secondly , had the draftsman conceived that a secure tenant ' s right to buy could be subject to a condition of ministerial consent under section 5 that right would not have been defined in section 118 in the terms quoted in paragraph 7 above , and provision would have been made for asserting and admitting or denying , and handling , claims to exercise the right to buy where ministerial consent was required . 	0
VG	985	If I concluded ( as I do not ) that section 5 was intended to operate in cases covered by Part V , I would agree with Buxton LJ that the Part V procedures could be made to work , but the absence of any indication that the procedures were devised to apply to conditional rights fortifies the inference that section 5 was not intended to operate in cases covered by Part V . Had it been so intended , the draftsman would have imposed a duty on a local authority to refer to the Secretary of State a claim to exercise the right to buy made by a tenant whose case fell within section 5 . 	0

WD	1060	I just spent the better part of a day with the faculty of the all-girls Ellis School in Pittsburgh , where I was reminded of all the best aspects of my own education around gender and gender roles . 	0
WD	1061	The survival of excellent girls ' and boys ' schools in just about every large community I can think of strikes me as testimony not to the enduring idea of separation of the sexes but rather to some very sophisticated evolving ideas of what it means to be a young woman or man . 	0
WD	1062	We celebrate the suddenly disproportionate success of girls in the conventional academic realm ( they do so much better in high school that they disadvantage one another when it comes to competitive college admission ) while we wonder whether one of our unending culture wars is on boys . 	0
WD	1063	Education for boys and young men is changing , and it ' s heartening , for example , to note that old-fashioned expressions of stereotypical maleness , like those caught on tape when Rutgers coach Mike Rice went off on his players , excite general shock and outrage . 	0
WD	1064	Curricula increasingly include diverse viewpoints , and access to self and creativity are as much a part of boys ' school programs as lacrosse and basketball ; schools work hard to imbue students with more beneficent ideas of what it means to be male , with responsibilities and difference equal parts of the equation . 	0

WD	1074	Once they start working , or going to college , they are going to be subjected to the reality of the secular world we live in , and it is better to prepare them for dealing with that fact before they are 18 years old . 	0

WD	1205	I even could read music and knew my multiplication tables and could add and subtract 3-digit numbers ( not to brag , but you know what I mean ) . 	0
WD	1206	However , I was behind socially ; I couldn ’ t stand up for myself without swearing ( actually using the f-word and such ) , I refused to ask for help , so I was redshirted . 	0
WD	1207	Intentionally and explicitly working to turn out strong , capable , assertive women , Ellis--its heritage , its excellent teachers , and its visionary leadership--is all about helping girls find and build on their strengths and passions . 	0
WD	1208	Ellis makes no apologies for its commitment to the growth of girls and young women as a single-sex school , and its palpable ethos had me wishing I had a daughter to send there . 	0

WD	1212	Most boys ' schools have long since stopped selling themselves as bastions of male hegemony and cut-it-with-a-knife testosterone culture . 	0
WD	1213	The gap is even wider with boys vs girls because of maturity levels . 	0
WD	1214	The gap then continues to get wider due to confidence issues . 	0
WD	1215	I teach middle school and see a HUGE difference in abilities between the younger and older kids . 	0
WD	1216	I held her back . 	0
WD	1217	My daughter was born on the cut off date . 	0
WD	1218	There have been a lot of studies that show people born later in the year ( March ) are more successful in life due to the age gap . 	0
WD	1219	This was promising to see . 	0
WD	1220	Another promising skill I saw was when he was stuck on a word , he remembered he wrote it previously and therefore looked back at the word to help him spell it again . 	0
WD	1221	He wanted all the action to start at the beginning and with all his ideas the characters were being sent in every direction possible . 	0
WD	1222	However , he had no idea how to start the beginning of his narrative and what the structure of a narrative is , with the orientation beginning the narrative and the complication following . 	0
WD	1223	This is quite interesting as it demonstrates that he is still at that level of a kindergarten / yr 1 student , being able to verbally produce a sentence however , not write it down exactly . 	0
WD	1224	From this , even though his structuring was slightly off track he was able to verbally produce some great sentences however , forgot them for when he had to write them down . 	0
WD	1225	I thought I would add this piece in to help develop an understanding of the difficulties one child has and the significant disadvantage he has academically . 	0
WD	1226	As previously mentioned in my last blog ( Weekly reflection 2 ) I was working individually with a child with significant learning difficulties . 	0
WD	1227	What I did notice whilst I was working with him was that at first he had absolutely no idea of what to write and me not knowing the movie did not help either but once I asked him to retell me what happened in the movie and started giving him some ideas he thought of his own and from there had some great ideas . 	0
WD	1228	He spends a lot of time out of class with the special education teachers receiving one on one work but missing out on other important activities . 	0

WD	1230	private schools will always be around . 	0

WD	1235	My son went to Columbus Public Schools , in Columbus , Ohio and they treated him and myself badly . 	0
WD	1236	I was constantly in the school and very involved in his education . 	0
WD	1237	It made no difference . 	0
WD	1238	They didn ' t want my help or my commitment to the school . 	0
WD	1239	I moved to the suburbs and the education in our suburban public schools are good the teachers were better and they appreciated my involvement . 	0
WD	1240	if you don ' t like the way the public schools are then elect better leaders . 	0

WD	1243	In 2013 , the world is decidedly different , and the battles are far less obscure . 	0
WD	1244	Colleges wrestle explicitly with how to combat " rape culture , " and events like the Steubenville trial generate national conversations around how our society fosters gender-role development . 	0
WD	1245	I had never really thought what it might be like to work in an all-female environment , stuck firmly at the bottom of a ladder , and so my summers there were a revelation . 	0
WD	1246	Not the least part of the revelation involved my discovery that the young leaders of the camp , members of the first generation of late-20th-century feminists , were pretty serious about using the camp experience--sailing , biking , swimming , and lots of group activities--as leadership development . 	0
WD	1247	I also learned the hard way not to step into problem-solving roles until I was asked to , and I saw that younger campers idolized the competence of their counselors as much as they loved their warmth and enthusiasm . 	0
WD	1248	The task of female role models and mentors was changing , and the staff was up to the work . 	0
WD	1249	I also discovered what " collaborative leadership " meant , as the administrative staff--led by a superb director not long out of college herself--talked things over and made decisions in ways that sounded way more like what Chris Argyris had been talking about in his myth-shattering Organizational Behavior course that year than the autocratic , just-follow-me style I had imbibed from television , movies , and high school . 	0
WD	1250	If summers found me in a land of strong and independent women , my first three teaching jobs ( my fourth has been in a decidedly coed environment ) were back in a man ' s world . 	0
WD	1251	I think many of my generation of male teachers , with varying experiences navigating the waters of what the news magazines assured us was a Feminist Revolution , had been chastened more than a little on the meaning of masculinity and manhood , and so we did our best to tame our little corners of school environments that occasionally evoked Lord of the Flies ; gently mocked as Sensitive New Age Guys , we tried to help our male students exchange bluster and boisterousness for an occasional listen and maybe even the occasional tear . 	0
WD	1252	I don ' t know how well it worked , but we felt we were doing our small part to win obscure battles in the most remote fields of that revolution . 	0
WD	1253	I wouldn ' t send my dog to public schools in Florida . 	1
WD	1254	I rose up to make changes . . . rose up to my feet and walked my family the hell out of a corrupt , unsafe , government battle ground and into the Private Catholic school system . 	0

WD	1257	If you fail to get your kids educated in our SHARED knowledge base to a high school level , you are guilty of child abuse . 	0
WD	1258	I am sorry , I am a hardliner on this . 	0
WD	1259	All schools should be accredited by at least the state level government and you should not be legally allowed to drop out until you are 16 years old . 	0
WD	1260	You are assigning your kids to a life of poverty , opening them up to abuse and cutting them off from their potential . 	0
WD	1261	I went there in 2009 with my highschool in a cricket tour . . . i went to rondebosch , sacs / sax ( forgot ) , wynberg and another school that i cant remember model c or private school is your best bet ! 	1
WD	1262	make sure however , you send your kid to extra tuitions after school for problem subjects because i can safely say that when i was in school , sports was more important rather than academics . . . everyone wants to be 1st team in cricket , soccer and rugby 	0
WD	1263	If the child has support throughout all of his schooling life , I see why not . 	1
WD	1264	So the question is … should a child who has such significant learning difficulties be in a mainstream classroom ? 	1
WD	1265	I do believe that all students have the right to a good education and although this child is at a low academic level , he still participates in class when prompted and the other students in the class still communicate and play with him even though he is significantly behind academically . 	0
WD	1266	He has no behaviour problems and no physical demands that will affect other students in the classroom . 	0
WD	1267	He still has one on one time with the special education teacher and is receiving great help from his class teacher now and from his peers . 	0
WD	1268	If this child was to be in a special school / support unit the social skills he has now would be diminished and he may be at an even lower level than he is now as there are more interruptions than in a mainstream class . 	0
WD	1269	When I taught in NYC before NCLB , students were leveled off to their level and abilities so children can advance and not be waiting for others to catch up and learn English even . 	0
WD	1270	For a critical mass families and kids , some period of single-sex education is part of a path toward an adulthood informed in positive ways by an understanding of both the differences between the sexes and the ways in which we are all bound by our shared and very human anxieties , aspirations , and capacities . 	0
WD	1271	All you commies out there can shove it right up your A$$ ! 	0
WD	1272	I ' m talking black , white , brown , asian , oriental , you name it they ' ve got it . 	0
WD	1273	So you won ' t get your undies in a bunch , the young people graduating from this school are from accross the race spectrum . 	0
WD	1274	That ' s unheard of in public schools . 	0
WD	1275	We have a local private High school who turns out bright talented young people . 	0
WD	1276	No amount of parent involvement is going to solve those problems . 	0
WD	1277	With a plethora of drugs and gang problems , public schools are the LAST place I would send my child ! 	1
WD	1278	I would not having a problem sending mine to public if they were learning . 	0
WD	1279	We have a few thousand years of evidence for how poorly men treat women when women are excluded from male institutions . 	0
WD	1280	Actually he ' s much bigger than most kids so it seems unlikely . 	0
WD	1281	They get a better education and they are safer from acts of violence . 	0
WD	1282	Public schools have become more interested in political correctness than in education and there is too little control over violence . 	0
WD	1283	Boys tend to play and act up less when girls are not around , and they ' re less inclined to show off and seek attention . 	0
WD	1284	Girls on the other hand do not benfit as much from same sex schools as boys . 	0
WD	1285	Girls tend to achieve as well in both mixed and same sex environments . 	0
WD	1286	Not a problem . 	0
WD	1287	I can also speak from my experiences as qualified teacher and child psyc . 	0
WD	1288	Same sex education works best for males . 	0
WD	1289	Boys tend to obtain better grades and have less disciplinary issues in same sex schools . 	0
WD	1290	That said all the above are generalisations and atypical results , doesn ' t mean they apply or are relavent to your daughter . 	0
WD	1291	My personal opinion : If your daughter is on the fence about it , i personally would go for the co ed school assuming its facilities , teachers , and resources are equal to that of the same sex . 	1
WD	1292	Education is far too important to let the government do it . 	0
WD	1293	It is wrong to send a child to government schools . 	1

WD	1295	Just know He will judge the wicked . 	0

WD	1297	you can demand all you want , but unless you have a school system that worthy of sending any child too , then it ' s all for not . 	0
WD	1298	teachers claim they are not paid enough . 	0
WD	1299	if that means sending them to private school , then so be it . 	0
WD	1300	no difference in home schooling . 	0
WD	1301	you had to research it before you decided that would be your major ? 	0
WD	1302	you say you have to spend your own money for supplies . 	0
WD	1303	well , excuse me , but you did know that before you decided to become a teacher . 	0
WD	1304	you had to intern somewhere ? 	0
WD	1305	It ' s a crappy situation , and god help any social worker who haves to work that one case , because they ' re not even walking a thin line anymore , they ' re trying to dance between the clouds of child protection and respect of parental care . 	0
WD	1306	So many abuse cases show few warning signs while they occur ( the ones we hear about in the press tend to be more gory or shocking than the majority ) , and sadly even if a child is watched by social carers for 23 hours and 59 minutes a day , a determined abuser will wait till the last minute . 	0
WD	1307	And while of course the vast majority of people who home educate won ' t be using it as an excuse to hide the abuse of their children , there will be someone somewhere who does , and if and when that occurs the media frenzy and search for blame will occur . 	0
WD	1308	However . . . 	0
WD	1309	Removal of a child from established programs and situations ( such as state education ) will always raise a question mark in these times . 	0
WD	1310	why ? 	0
WD	1311	demand the school provide . 	0
WD	1312	Even the best public schools cannot reach every student all of the time . 	0
WD	1313	Additionally , American families hold a plethora of educational positions and beliefs that might move them to choose a private school . 	0
WD	1314	she is obviously a liberal . 	0
WD	1315	only a liberal buys into the if you make more money you have to give to the poor mindset . 	0
WD	1316	what she fails to recognize is , the more money you have , the more you give to charity . 	0
WD	1317	you donate your time , you give away clothing / shoes / coats to the needy , you assist with fundraisers to raise money for the poor whether it be for school supplies , food banks , etc . 	0
WD	1318	people with money give more . 	0
WD	1319	simple as that . 	0
WD	1320	you don ' t need to take additional tax dollars to prove that . 	0
WD	1321	i live in an area ( Georgia ) where there is no way in h*ll i would send my kid to a public school here . 	1
WD	1322	it is not safe , the teachers are cheating and it is riddled with gang activity . 	0
WD	1323	sending a child whose parents have money to a private school doesn ' t mean they are bad parents , it simply means they want more for their child . 	0
WD	1324	Of course , turning up late for a doctors appointment for your child will also raise a question mark , but generally these things mean nothing in isolation ( an A&E visit with a child will gain a mark , but you ' ll need a fair few before anyone pays any attention to it ) . 	0

WD	1343	Early advocates of coeducation like Bronson Alcott were thought to be batty . 	0
WD	1344	While the debate goes on about the legitimacy of single-sex classes and schools in the public sector , private and independent schools keep taking the concept to whole new levels . 	0
WD	1345	Once upon a time coeducation was unthinkable . 	0
WD	1346	As a kid I experienced both single-sex and coeducational schools . 	0
WD	1347	My public elementary school was coed , of course , and then I had six years of boys-only junior and senior high school . 	0
WD	1348	Plenty of progressive educators and theorists have since laid to rest most of the traditional concerns and fears of coeducation skeptics . 	0
WD	1349	Public schools have been coed for a long time , and old schoolhouses with separate " Boys " and " Girls " entrances are quaint in a way that makes us shake our heads . 	0
WD	1350	Then followed a couple of years of all-male university , until we were happily rolled over by the tidal wave of vintage 1970 coeducation , leaving the president to figure out how to keep his promise that we ' d produce " a thousand male leaders " every year ; so was born the cramped room students call a " forced triple . " 	0
WD	1351	As at many all-male institutions , the arrival of women didn ' t make a huge dent in the culture right away , and so it when I found myself the lone male at a girls ' summer camp ( the maintenance guy , often reeking slightly of rotting garbage ) I experienced culture shock . 	0
WD	1352	I know one " home-educated " kid . 	0
WD	1353	I ' m not a fan of the nanny state , but I can see why the government is doing this . 	0
WD	1354	The trouble is , home schooling can be a cover for all sorts of undesirable stuff . 	0
WD	1355	I don ' t want to be the hate figure here , but home schooling is probably always going to be the subject of some suspicion purely because any possible abuse wouldn ' t be able to be reported by any other pupils or teachers . 	0
WD	1356	As far as I can tell , the education he receives at home is pretty minimal - nothing like what you ' d get in school . 	0
WD	1357	And yeah , I agree that people shouldn ' t be automatically deisgnated as suspects for child abuse simply because they decide on home teaching . 	0
WD	1358	I ’ m ready . 	0
WD	1359	People generally do this because they want what is best for their children . 	0
WD	1360	For example , religion is a good thing . . . the public school does not believe in that . . . . . 	0
WD	1361	Lady , you need to get your head out of your *ss . 	0
WD	1362	There are plenty of good reasons for sending my kids to private school , and guess what , they are none of your business but here are a few . 	1
WD	1363	The government has proven over and over that they can not be trusted to do the right thing and I am not going to let them take over my child ' s education . 	0
