MT	3	Clearly the landlord has to pay for some repairs before a new lease . 	0
MT	4	All the more so as for an adequate profit the rental rate as compared to the base rent need not be raised for every new lease . 	0

MT	6	Secret services must be more tightly regulated in order to prevent excessive surveillance . 	1
MT	7	Parliamentary control however hampers the work of intelligence services for it jeopardizes the secrecy and security of confidential data and informants . 	0
MT	8	Besides , intelligence services intervene massively in the privacy of citizens and must therefore be monitored more closely to prevent abuse . 	0
MT	9	You should watch less television , as too much TV makes you stupid in the long run , like your brother . 	1
MT	10	It would be an exception if you only watched quiz shows , but you tend to watch Big Brother and X-Diaries . 	0

MT	17	School uniforms should be introduced in our schools again . 	1
MT	18	Uniforms always and immediately provoke fear of losing one ' s individuality but what ' s really lacking in schools today is rather a real sense of community , which would possibly be strengthened by an equal , collective appearance . 	0
MT	19	Furthermore , it would facilitate the finding of truants , who may wish to get away with fewer classes at school . 	0
MT	20	For instance , the taxpayer stood in for the failed bank ' Hypo Real Estate ' with a three-figure billion amount . 	0

MT	30	But surely these costs could be covered by a minimal increase in rent over the course of the entire lease . 	0
