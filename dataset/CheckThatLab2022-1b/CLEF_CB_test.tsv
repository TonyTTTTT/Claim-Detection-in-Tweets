ClaimBuster	251				I have ordered an investigation.	1
ClaimBuster	252				In the meantime, I think it's important to have what's called Immediate Helping Hand, which is direct money to states so that seniors, poor seniors, don't have to choose between food and medicine.	0
ClaimBuster	253				Because of paperwork and regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	254				I suggest to you that the core problem -- 1 country spent $400 million lobbying in 1988, our country.	1
ClaimBuster	255				The programs will be good because the elected officials will be listening to -- I said the other night I was all ears and I would listen to any good idea.	0
ClaimBuster	256				There's nothing the matter with that.	0
ClaimBuster	257				Maybe we need to do a better job in mental clinics to help them.	0
ClaimBuster	258				We should support uh - the laws which the United States has passed in order to protect us from uh - those who would destroy us from within.	0
ClaimBuster	259				I don't think so, and I think it's going in exactly the wrong direction.	0
ClaimBuster	260				But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.	1
ClaimBuster	261				Well, first, let me say, number one, when I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it.	1
ClaimBuster	262				It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	263				I think we're going to have to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	264				And I know there's a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	265				I want Joe the plumber to spread that wealth around.	0
ClaimBuster	266				And I'm not going to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	267				I would say if you want to continue as Most Favored Nation status for your government owned industries as well as your private ones, observe human rights in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	268				And I'm asking the American people to give me another opportunity and I'll rest on my record, but I'll also tell you, when times are tough, we need a steady hand at the tiller and the great honor of my life was to always put my country first.	0
ClaimBuster	269				I'm proud that important military figures who are supporting me in this race: former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili; just yesterday, General Eisenhower's son, General John Eisenhower, endorsed me; General Admiral William Crown; General Tony McBeak, who ran the Air Force war so effectively for his father -- all believe I would make a stronger commander in chief.	1
ClaimBuster	270				How would it be resolved when those disputes occur?	0
ClaimBuster	271				It now looks, because of steady negotiation, that we may have an agreement that will remove the Cubans from Angola.	0
ClaimBuster	272				And now they had ingenuity eight years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	273				There's been a lot of talk about family values in this campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	274				I agree with what I think is the major premise of your question, sir, that we are going to have to create a new conservation ethic in the minds of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	275				I'll give you a couple of examples.	0
ClaimBuster	276				All those things are designed to make sure that the American people, their genius, their grit, their determination, is -- is channeled and -- and they have an opportunity to succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	277				And for a guy that started out with everything he owned in the trunk of his car --	0
ClaimBuster	278				I would restore the concept of the fireside chat, which was an integral part of the administration of Franklin Roosevelt.	1
ClaimBuster	279				I vowed to the American people after that fateful day of September the 11th that we would not rest nor tire until we're safe.	1
ClaimBuster	280				We have a good, stable economic policy.	0
ClaimBuster	281				And then you add to that food and wardrobe, and all the other things, and you only have a small portion going for weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	282				This evening we talked about national strength.	1
ClaimBuster	283				If you're a family of four in Massachusetts, making $50,000, you get a 50% cut in the federal income taxes you pay.	1
ClaimBuster	284				I was -- broke with my party in 1985, one of the first three Democrats to fight for a balanced budget when it was heresy.	1
ClaimBuster	285				And I ask you to consider the experience I have had in working with a President who has revolutionized the situation around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	286				This is uh - what the American people want.	0
ClaimBuster	287				The United States must and will maintain complete access to the Panama Canal.	0
ClaimBuster	288				If we don't trust younger workers to manage some of their own money with the Social Security surplus, to grow from $1 trillion to $3 trillion, it will be impossible to bridge the gap without it.	0
ClaimBuster	289				She's a fantastic lady I met in Charlotte, North Carolina.	1
ClaimBuster	290				You know, my wife, Hillary, gave me a book about a year ago in which the author defined insanity as just doing the same old thing over and over again and expecting a different result.	1
ClaimBuster	291				And I'm going to act responsibly, as I have acted responsibly throughout my military career and throughout my career in the United States Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	292				Another issue in this campaign, Governor Carter has endorsed the Democratic platform, which calls for more spending, bigger deficits, more inflation or mare taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	293				Their hope is that we grow weary and we leave.	0
ClaimBuster	294				Those are the words of two Republicans, respected, both on the Foreign Relations Committee.	0
ClaimBuster	295				Even the proponents of it admitted that no more than four hundred thousand jobs would be uh - made available.	1
ClaimBuster	296				That is a very serious indictment of this administration.	0
ClaimBuster	297				Saddam Hussein is under a U.N. resolution not to threaten his neighbors or threaten his own, repress his own citizens.	1
ClaimBuster	298				We just have a different approach.	0
ClaimBuster	299				I congratulate him on -- on taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in al-Qaeda.	1
ClaimBuster	300				We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.	0
ClaimBuster	301				That's what should concern us, not the history of ten, or fifteen, or twenty years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	302				But let me mention another thing.	0
ClaimBuster	303				The facts are that he was systematically deceiving the inspectors.	1
ClaimBuster	304				And one of the reasons I felt so strongly that the United States needed to participate was because of our relations with NATO, and NATO is going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	305				If we fail, it's been a great serious failure for everyone - for the human race.	0
ClaimBuster	306				Well I believe we should use any and all means necessary to take out people who pose a threat to us and our friends around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	307				And that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know.	0
ClaimBuster	308				I want to invest in your family.	0
ClaimBuster	309				Well, look, I want to make sure that we are investing in energy in order to free ourselves from the dependence on foreign oil.	0
ClaimBuster	310				That's just one tiny example.	0
ClaimBuster	311				You should have shown up on the floor in the Senate and voted for it then.	0
ClaimBuster	312				When you don't have any ideas, I guess you say the other person's ideas are old.	0
ClaimBuster	313				Now here is the contrast.	0
ClaimBuster	314				I see the funding that is required, and I hope the Congress will fully fund this bill.	0
ClaimBuster	315				I thought that's exactly what he and Mrs. Clinton and them fought for in 1993 was a government-run health care system.	1
ClaimBuster	316				The goals ought to be an education system that leaves no child behind, Medicare for our seniors, a Social Security system that's safe and secure, foreign policy that's in our nation's interest, and a strong military, and then bring people together to achieve those goals.	0
ClaimBuster	317				I think it's going to require a combination of supply management and reasonable price supports to make sure that our farmers get a decent price and I think it also is going to require an administration that understand that there are tremendous opportunities out there for the development of new uses for agricultural products, new uses which can help us to clean up our environment at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	318				The fact of the matter is that the next president of the United States is going to have to go to the White House seriously, he is going to have to work with the Congress seriously he can't turn to the Congress and blame them for the fact that we don't have a balanced budget and that we have billions and billions of dollars in red ink.	0
ClaimBuster	319				If they had a pre-existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all.	0
ClaimBuster	320				The auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride, that they're helping to build America.	1
ClaimBuster	321				We've got to do both, and that's exactly what my plan does.	1
ClaimBuster	322				We've got to move ahead with the strategic arms negotiation process, with the comprehensive test ban treaty and with negotiations leading to conventional force reduction in Europe with deeper cuts on the Soviet side and Senator Bentsen and I will pursue that policy.	0
ClaimBuster	323				I don't think the surplus exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the federal government, I think it exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	324				That happens to be a fact.	1
ClaimBuster	325				We can do all of those things, and at the same time build a future in which we are standing on a good strong fiscal foundation.	0
ClaimBuster	326				I've met some of those people.	1
ClaimBuster	327				I will issue a white paper after this broadcast, quoting exactly what he said on compulsory arbitration, for example, and the record will show that I have been correct.	0
ClaimBuster	328				Thirdly, I think the question before the American people is: as they look at this country and as they look at the world around them, the goals are the same for all Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	329				And that's why I must say I agree with General Colin Powell that we're not there yet.	0
ClaimBuster	330				This costs our uh - government about uh - $1.4 billion a year.	1
ClaimBuster	331				I was just going to -- --	0
ClaimBuster	332				We have to change this whole culture.	0
ClaimBuster	333				And we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat.	0
ClaimBuster	334				You can run, but you can't hide.	0
ClaimBuster	335				I regret the things in my own long campaign that have been mistaken, but I'm trying to do away with those the last ten days.	0
ClaimBuster	336				A lot of them are thrown out because of all the scandals.	0
ClaimBuster	337				The farmer produced these surpluses because the government asked him to through legislation during the war.	1
ClaimBuster	338				That requires a cool hand at the tiller.	0
ClaimBuster	339				We have reduced the number of people in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines from three million, one hundred - three million, five hundred thousand to two mil- lion one hundred thousand.	1
ClaimBuster	340				The president's done nothing to try to fix it.	1
ClaimBuster	341				You know that I mean what I say.	0
ClaimBuster	342				But I think it's important to understand, we're not going to solve Social Security and Medicare unless we understand the rest of our tax policies.	0
ClaimBuster	343				I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example.	0
ClaimBuster	344				I just told you about this manufacturing job loss which is going to increase.	1
ClaimBuster	345				You have questioned my patriotism.	0
ClaimBuster	346				I believe that inflation today is caused by government simply spending more than government takes in, at the same time that government has imposed upon business and industry, from the shopkeeper on the corner to the biggest industrial plant in America, countless harassing regulations and punitive taxes that have reduced productivity at the same time they have increased the cost of production.	0
ClaimBuster	347				Well, that bill has not yet come down to the Oval Office, so I am not in a position to make any judgment on it tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	348				So I don't -- I don't think there's any doubt that Senator Obama wants to restrict trade and he wants to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	349				He is the leader of that country.	1
ClaimBuster	350				As an aid to enlistment.	0
ClaimBuster	351				There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there.	0
ClaimBuster	352				And if you answer all of those questions yes, why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for.	0
ClaimBuster	353				And so we ought to do everything we can to end racial profiling.	0
ClaimBuster	354				The president relied on Afghan warlords and he outsourced that job too.	1
ClaimBuster	355				So in my state we toughen up the juvenile justice laws.	1
ClaimBuster	356				When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test.	1
ClaimBuster	357				An issue I have been involved in for many, many years and I'm proud of the work of the work that I've done there along with Senator Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	358				And incidentally, Senator Johnson was among those who rejected that position - voted with the seventy against the twelve.	1
ClaimBuster	359				It was to go into a time capsule and would be read in 100 years when that time capsule was opened.	1
ClaimBuster	360				Keep the government as far out of it as possible, make insurance available to the poorest of the poor, through vouchers, next range in the income bracket, through tax credits, and get on about the business of pooling insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	361				But the federal government also can play a very important role.	0
ClaimBuster	362				And so, we've got a good military.	0
ClaimBuster	363				We have spent their money.	1
ClaimBuster	364				We've got thousands and thousands of homes owned by government boarded up, being vandalized, that have been taken in mortgage foreclosures.	1
ClaimBuster	365				He tends to distort on a number of occasions.	0
ClaimBuster	366				Let's make our schools safe, let's make our neighborhoods safe.	0
ClaimBuster	367				You just heard the president say that young people ought to be able to take money out of Social Security and put it in their own accounts.	1
ClaimBuster	368				You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes.	0
ClaimBuster	369				He's for letting the oil companies into the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.	1
ClaimBuster	370				This is fact slinging -- a bill earlier this year.	0
ClaimBuster	371				These are the-my answer is do not make these unilateral cuts, and everybody now realizes that peace through strength works, and so this is where I have a big difference.	0
ClaimBuster	372				And I believe when the average hour for many farmers' wage is about fifty cents an hour, he should do better.	0
ClaimBuster	373				We've got to rebuild our military.	0
ClaimBuster	374				Thank goodness we had a Republican Congress there.	1
ClaimBuster	375				And affirmative action is not just something that applies to people of color.	0
ClaimBuster	376				If it is a well-known fact that I opposed air pollution laws in California, the only thing I can possibly think of is that the President must be suggesting the law that the Federal Government tried to impose on the State of California - not a law, but regulations - that would have made it impossible to drive an automobile within the city limits of any California city, or to have a place to put it if you did drive it against their regulations.	1
ClaimBuster	377				And talk about the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	378				The HMOs are against the patient's rights bill, the Dingle-Norwood bill that I support, and that Gov.	1
ClaimBuster	379				The FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails.	1
ClaimBuster	380				AARP thinks that the -- the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	381				This is the most liberal big-spending record in the United States Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	382				You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system.	1
ClaimBuster	383				There also isn't any question but that the free people of Cuba - the people who want to be free - are going to be supported and that they will attain their freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	384				We need somebody to simplify the code, to be fair, to continue prosperity by sharing some of the surplus with the people who pay the bills, particularly those at the bottom end of the economic ladder.	0
ClaimBuster	385				Now, have I got that wrong?	0
ClaimBuster	386				And long before President Bush and I get a tax cut -- and that's who gets it -- long before we do, I'm going to invest in homeland security and I'm going to make sure we're not cutting COPS programs in America and we're fully staffed in our firehouses and that we protect the nuclear and chemical plants.	1
ClaimBuster	387				And that's really what this campaign is going to be about.	0
ClaimBuster	388				And that's why I think it's so important for us to reverse course, because that's the central front on terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	389				But make no mistake about it, we should do everything we can to see that the will of the Serbian people expressed in this extraordinary election is done.	0
ClaimBuster	390				I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	391				Now, let me pose this question to America.	0
ClaimBuster	392				Just so you put it out.	0
ClaimBuster	393				Now, there are people who go to bed hungry in the United States - far less, incidentally, than used to go to bed hungry when we came into power at the end of the Truman Administration.	0
ClaimBuster	394				We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out.	0
ClaimBuster	395				That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted.	0
ClaimBuster	396				I ask each of you just to look into your hearts, look into your guts.	0
ClaimBuster	397				Now, on arms control, we're completing 4 years.	1
ClaimBuster	398				I think, for example, take -- when they took 40 million acres of land out of circulation without consulting local officials, I thought that was --	0
ClaimBuster	399				And that's saying something in that bunch.	0
ClaimBuster	400				He was hoping to turn a blind eye.	0
ClaimBuster	401				Nobody who's looked at it that's serious, actually believes it adds up.	0
ClaimBuster	402				Secondly, with respect to parental notification, I'm not going to require a 16-or 17-year-old kid who's been raped by her father and who's pregnant to have to notify her father.	0
ClaimBuster	403				"He said, ""I'll get back to you."""	1
ClaimBuster	404				I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers.	0
ClaimBuster	405				We know nothing about them.	1
ClaimBuster	406				And I pushed for some core principles: making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if they're putting money up.	1
ClaimBuster	407				And so what I'm trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally.	0
ClaimBuster	408				He said he would have by now put forward a plan to reform Medicare and Social Security, because he pointed out they're on the road to bankruptcy.	1
ClaimBuster	409				And I can only say that I'm very proud that President Eisenhower restored dignity and decency and, frankly, good language to the conduct of the presidency of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	410				And by holding the lid on federal spending we have been able to do an- a good job, an affirmative job in inflation and as a result have added to the jobs in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	411				And I think this is uh - uh - part of uh - of just being a human being.	0
ClaimBuster	412				Our association and connection with our allies is essential to America's strength.	0
ClaimBuster	413				And she's going after fact after fact, and she's lying again, because she said she -- you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine.	1
ClaimBuster	414				These are people that care, that are trying to give of themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	415				Now maybe it's better just to get together and sit down and talk.	0
ClaimBuster	416				He repeated it again in a television debate that we had.	1
ClaimBuster	417				We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	418				One of my promises is going to be Social Security reform, and you bet, we need to take a trillion dollars out of that $2.4 trillion surplus.	1
ClaimBuster	419				And those that I haven't been able to keep, it's not for lack of trying and we're going to get it done in a second term.	0
ClaimBuster	420				There are some who allege, I can't prove it true or untrue, that uh - such a statement uh - in effect invited the North Koreans to invade South Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	421				That's right at the top of my agenda.	0
ClaimBuster	422				"I remember going down to the basement of the White House the day we committed our troops as last resort, looking at Tommy Franks and the generals on the ground, asking them, ""Do we have the right plan with the right troop level?"""	1
ClaimBuster	423				I support it and the Pescadores Island.	0
ClaimBuster	424				That's one of the big reasons I vetoed it.	1
ClaimBuster	425				What happens in South Africa, where, for example, the Nobel Prize winner, 2 days ago, said this administration is seen as working with the oppressive government of South Africa.	1
ClaimBuster	426				I understand that we must find Al Qaida wherever they hide.	0
ClaimBuster	427				It's going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker -- Democratic Speaker Tip O'Neill.	0
ClaimBuster	428				And it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him.	0
ClaimBuster	429				They make $51,000 combined income, they pay about $3500 in taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	430				I brought this up recently with Vincent Fox the newly elected president in Mexico, he's a man I know from Mexico.	1
ClaimBuster	431				"I think ""punish"" is the wrong word."	0
ClaimBuster	432				And some say that that's what Putin intended in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	433				We're going to have a good economic package.	0
ClaimBuster	434				I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization.	0
ClaimBuster	435				You put $90 billion into -- into green jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	436				The misery index -- unemployment and inflation added together -- it was invented by the Democrats -- went right through the roof.	1
ClaimBuster	437				This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history.	0
ClaimBuster	438				Weapons of mass destruction, nuclear proliferation.	0
ClaimBuster	439				But let me also note that as I said earlier, we're going to have to do more than just going after leaders and -- and killing bad guys, important as that is.	0
ClaimBuster	440				And I'm going to work together with Congress to say, OK, what -- what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance?	0
ClaimBuster	441				Uh - I have made other recommendations after each of the other trips; for example, after my trip abroad to Hungary I made some recommendations with regard to the Hungarian refugee situation which were adopted, not only by the President but some of them were enacted into law by the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	442				But if I found somebody that had a conflict of interest that would try to illegally do something as a foreign -- registered lobby, the laws cover this.	1
ClaimBuster	443				It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship.	0
ClaimBuster	444				And that's all I'm trying to do, is put it in focus.	0
ClaimBuster	445				I believe the answer lies in just recognizing human nature and how we make everything else work in this country, when we want it to work.	0
ClaimBuster	446				If we grow the economy it's going to help Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	447				You add all the states that've used the instant check and how many weapons they keep, kept out of the hands of criminals.	0
ClaimBuster	448				They surely don't let me do that.	0
ClaimBuster	449				I'm not satisfied when we are failing to develop the natural resources of the United States to the fullest.	0
ClaimBuster	450				And let me cite several examples.	0
ClaimBuster	451				But I don't think that we can ignore the role played by guns.	0
ClaimBuster	452				I went to the Olympics when they were in trouble to try and get them on track.	1
ClaimBuster	453				When Mr. Nitze, a good negotiator, returned, he was rebuked, and his boss was fired.	1
ClaimBuster	454				(LAUGHTER) I said I'd do four things; tort reform, education reform, welfare reform and juvenile justice reform.	1
ClaimBuster	455				With the fiscal program that I have, and if you look at the projections, it shows that we will reduce unemployment, that we will continue to win the battle against inflation, and at the same time give the kind of quality of life that I believe is possible in America.	0
ClaimBuster	456				In our economic plan, the $500 child credit can be used for young people, rolled over and over and over, you, of course not this age, but if you have a child two years old, 7 percent interest would be worth about $18,000 by the time that child was ready for college.	1
ClaimBuster	457				I want to say in the beginning that I am profoundly grateful for the chance that you have given me to serve as president for the last four years.	1
ClaimBuster	458				I think the only people that are going to show up to register or get a license -- I guess licensing like a driver's license for a gun, the only people that are going to show up are law-abiding citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	459				We comprise about 30 percent of the world's economic trade power influence.	1
ClaimBuster	460				And he'll do very well when we get into the debates.	0
ClaimBuster	461				But this will make a difference in terms of whether or not we can move this economy forward for these young people...	0
ClaimBuster	462				These are accounts that allow somebody to buy a low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax-free savings.	1
ClaimBuster	463				I'm a guy who wants to help with the experience I have, the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	464				If we're going to protect American children and American families and people who live as prisoners in their own home, we've got to stop guns from being dumped on the street.	0
ClaimBuster	465				Now that was gone into by two congressional committees, and following that investigation, both committees overwhelmingly approved me, and the House and the Senate did likewise.	1
ClaimBuster	466				It's time to put the American people first, to invest and grow this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	467				And at that point, we can pick from a variety of plans and develop new plans.	0
ClaimBuster	468				And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands.	0
ClaimBuster	469				That is not going to work.	0
ClaimBuster	470				And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.	1
ClaimBuster	471				I think there's enough -- we're even looking at our tax cut proposal, our economic package.	0
ClaimBuster	472				I propose an American version of what works in other countries -- I think we can do it better: invest and grow.	0
ClaimBuster	473				Well, we've just finished almost the whole debate.	0
ClaimBuster	474				You did everything you could to kill the Clean Water Act	1
ClaimBuster	475				I can -- and thanks, Washington U. as well.	0
ClaimBuster	476				I will just say my time is running out here.	0
ClaimBuster	477				And then we would have to start all over again.	0
ClaimBuster	478				You can't carry a gun into a school.	0
ClaimBuster	479				Well, the President doesn't have it quite right.	0
ClaimBuster	480				I think it makes the world safer and, frankly, it makes the United States safer.	0
ClaimBuster	481				I know that the economic program that I have proposed for this nation in the next few years can resolve many of the problems that trouble us today.	0
ClaimBuster	482				Well, I think it will continue to be terrorist networks.	0
ClaimBuster	483				You can't worry about polls or focus groups.	0
ClaimBuster	484				That's the stuff that campaigns should be made of.	0
ClaimBuster	485				But we did factor in our own ideas with regard to increases in the projected military spending that we believe would, over a period of time, do what is necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	486				It was once called voodoo economics.	1
ClaimBuster	487				We can offshore drill now.	1
ClaimBuster	488				In the 2000 debates, there was no mention of terrorism, for instance.	1
ClaimBuster	489				That was the key legislation at the time and put us on the road to eliminating this issue of nuclear waste and the nuclear fuel that has to be taken care of.	0
ClaimBuster	490				We uphold the standards of conduct which they would never follow.	0
ClaimBuster	491				We are going to need more cooperation with our allies.	0
ClaimBuster	492				Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, others, knew how to lead.	0
ClaimBuster	493				And I have -- well, not quite that long.	0
ClaimBuster	494				And if indeed all the jobs were going to move south because there are lower wages, there are lower wages now and they haven't done that.	1
ClaimBuster	495				You did, Ann heard of him.	0
ClaimBuster	496				I'm also opposed to a plan that diverts 1 out of every $6 away from the Social Security Trust Fund.	1
ClaimBuster	497				Why, I had a great response to that.	1
ClaimBuster	498				Nineteen fifty-three we tried to put an appropriation of five billion dollars for our defenses.	1
ClaimBuster	499				Now, I doubt anybody here makes more than $330,000 a year.	0
ClaimBuster	500				Now there are some things we can do to help people who currently do get entitlements to get off public assistance.	0
ClaimBuster	501				And none of these things happened.	1
ClaimBuster	502				Once you automate your records, then you don't have to have a waiting period, but at least you can check.	0
ClaimBuster	503				My intentions in the field of civil rights have been spelled out in the Republican platform.	1
ClaimBuster	504				All the people who may still be watching or viewing.	0
ClaimBuster	505				It's a very unstable situation.	0
ClaimBuster	506				This is the biggest turnaround in the history of the country.	1
ClaimBuster	507				We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI.	1
ClaimBuster	508				He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women.	1
ClaimBuster	509				You can't tell me that on the day that we went into that war and it started -- it was principally the United States, the America and Great Britain and one or two others.	0
ClaimBuster	510				After this year is over, we'll resolve it just as we did with Social Security in `83.	1
ClaimBuster	511				We should have our differences.	0
ClaimBuster	512				But on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new.	0
ClaimBuster	513				You look at the record of the last four years and say is Iran closer to a bomb?	0
ClaimBuster	514				We're going to have a new Congress, and we're going to say to them, you've listened to the voters the way we have.	0
ClaimBuster	515				That crime bill is going to be one of my highest priorities next January if I become president.	0
ClaimBuster	516				To those of you in the audience who are business people: pretty simple.	0
ClaimBuster	517				And with our economy in such terrible disarray and getting worse by the month.	0
ClaimBuster	518				Republicans wanted to have just a majority vote to confirm a judge and the Democrats were blocking in an unprecedented fashion.	1
ClaimBuster	519				That's why -- to go back to your question -- I want to send a message -- we all should -- to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.	0
ClaimBuster	520				I do not suggest in any way, nor have I ever, that that indicates that Mr. Nixon has the slightest sympathy, involvement, or in any way imply any inferences in regard to the Ku Klux Klan.	0
ClaimBuster	521				I wish that he would consider changing his mind on that.	0
ClaimBuster	522				I do think this, though.	0
ClaimBuster	523				I think that we also have to keep a weather eye toward Saddam Hussein because he is taking advantage of this situation to once again make threats, and he needs to understand that he's not only dealing with Israel, he is dealing -- he's dealing with us if he is making the kind of threats that he's talking about there.	0
ClaimBuster	524				And we ought to try to meet the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	525				The President trusts the government.	0
ClaimBuster	526				It's very clear to me.	0
ClaimBuster	527				Well, it's cost-effective to help Russia succeed in its revolution; it's pennies on the dollar compared to going back to the Cold War.	1
ClaimBuster	528				Morale in today's military is too low.	0
ClaimBuster	529				Uh the Federal Reserve Board indicated that the supply of money would be held between four to four and a half and seven and seven and a half.	1
ClaimBuster	530				The president just said the FBI had changed its culture.	0
ClaimBuster	531				I mean, this is a little defensive on your part, Susan, to be honest with you.	0
ClaimBuster	532				There is a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	533				But it's very clear that I have disagreed with the Bush administration.	1
ClaimBuster	534				When they voted -- when they proposed reducing taxes, you voted against it 126 times.	1
ClaimBuster	535				But I think the president, again, still hasn't shown how he's going to go about it the right way.	0
ClaimBuster	536				The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we've got to make choices.	0
ClaimBuster	537				You know what she should have done?	0
ClaimBuster	538				Then it went to the Russians and said, let's see if you can do something.	1
ClaimBuster	539				But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists.	0
ClaimBuster	540				My favorite bumper sticker, though, is: Annoy the Media.	1
ClaimBuster	541				But on Medicare, for current retirees, he's cutting $716 billion from the program.	1
ClaimBuster	542				Yes, it'll create bubble jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	543				Uh - FHA, which used to be a very responsible agency, uh - that everyone looked to to help own a home, lost six million dollars last year.	1
ClaimBuster	544				This is about, somebody said earlier, one of the first questions, we're together.	1
ClaimBuster	545				That's the kind of leadership I want to provide.	0
ClaimBuster	546				I found that was rather difficult to do.	0
ClaimBuster	547				Absolutely we can win, because it's your country.	0
ClaimBuster	548				And he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is.	1
ClaimBuster	549				Now, with regard to having to say whether we would try to survive in the event of a nuclear war, of course we would.	0
ClaimBuster	550				Government shouldn't be a heavy hand.	0
ClaimBuster	551				The man loves his family a lot, and I appreciate that, because I love my family.	1
ClaimBuster	552				You must say that if you receive money you must show us whether or not children are learning to read and write and add and subtract.	0
ClaimBuster	553				My point I have made already, Mr. President, with regard to negotiating: it does not call for nuclear superiority on the part of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	554				I want us to invest in your future.	0
ClaimBuster	555				But it can't be dismissed that easily.	0
ClaimBuster	556				Well, but -- but virtually -- virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate.	0
ClaimBuster	557				The argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty-five years.	0
ClaimBuster	558				Almost half of all the tax cut benefits, as I said under Governor Bush's plan, go to the wealthiest 1%.	1
ClaimBuster	559				We'd like to have your support.	0
ClaimBuster	560				If they can't get a loan, that means that they can't make payroll.	0
ClaimBuster	561				I want all seniors to have prescription drugs in Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	562				So I will tell you this.	0
ClaimBuster	563				And there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate like we're having tonight about health care, about energy policy, about tax policy.	1
ClaimBuster	564				We cannot be the policemen of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	565				They see ethical problems in the Whitehouse today.	0
ClaimBuster	566				But the president and his friends took it out in the House, and now you don't have that right.	1
ClaimBuster	567				We still need to cover about 20million people and a lot of children.	1
ClaimBuster	568				We spend 30% more of our income than any nation on earth on health care, and yet we insure fewer people.	1
ClaimBuster	569				Well, thank you very much, Jim, and thanks to the commission and the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, for hosting us tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	570				That's how we went after Al Qaida and bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	571				And, Senator Obama, when he said -- and he signed a piece of paper that said he would take public financing for his campaign if I did -- that was back when he was a long-shot candidate -- you didn't keep your word.	1
ClaimBuster	572				Nobody has more respect for women than I do.	0
ClaimBuster	573				And in that connection I again would say that while Senator Kennedy says we are for the status quo, I do believe that he uh - would agree that I am just as sincere in believing that my proposals for federal aid to education, my proposals for health care are just as sincerely held as his.	0
ClaimBuster	574				But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans.	1
ClaimBuster	575				Mr. Bush says it's a hunky-dory deal.	1
ClaimBuster	576				Cocaine is up 141 percent -- marijuana, cocaine up 166 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	577				But it is important that we learn about what has been effective.	0
ClaimBuster	578				When Mr. Quayle said that all the networks said, that's not true.	0
ClaimBuster	579				In each case, I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country.	0
ClaimBuster	580				Affirmative action means that you take extra steps to acknowledge the history of discrimination and injustice and prejudice and bring all people into the American dream because it helps everybody, not just those who are directly benefitting.	0
ClaimBuster	581				I said that we'd go after al-Qaeda and bin Laden, we have.	1
ClaimBuster	582				You know, this is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices.	1
ClaimBuster	583				Joe, I want to tell you, I'll not only help you buy that business that you worked your whole life for and be able -- and I'll keep your taxes low and I'll provide available and affordable health care for you and your employees.	0
ClaimBuster	584				And I'll take care of them.	0
ClaimBuster	585				But more than that, to do the kind of job that I'm elected to do, will do it with as much good humor as I can, but at the same time will do it in a way which will achieve the goals we want for ourselves and our people.	0
ClaimBuster	586				I'd like to thank all the folks around America that no one ever knows about -- the woman that was holding the AIDS baby she adopted in Cedar Rapids, Iowa who asked me to do something more for adoption; the woman who stopped along the road in Wisconsin and wept because her husband had lost his job after 27 years; all the people who are having a tough time and the people who are winning but who know how desperately we need to change.	1
ClaimBuster	587				He's in the electronics business in -- in St. Louis.	1
ClaimBuster	588				No, they were taunting us.	0
ClaimBuster	589				Senators and congressmen have a wide choice.	0
ClaimBuster	590				It basically protected states from the action of one state to another.	0
ClaimBuster	591				We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty.	0
ClaimBuster	592				Where we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	593				So I want to say that, with the Nunn-Lugar thing...	0
ClaimBuster	594				"Reminds me of the line from the movie, ""Show me the money."""	0
ClaimBuster	595				I'm very proud of that.	0
ClaimBuster	596				I don't think that's my job or my business.	0
ClaimBuster	597				For most of my time as governor a woman was my chief of staff.	1
ClaimBuster	598				We've worked hard to expand public school choice in my balanced budget bill.	0
ClaimBuster	599				The State Department has said that.	1
ClaimBuster	600				I do not believe we should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure.	0
ClaimBuster	601				There are 3.5 million more women living in poverty today than when the president took office.	1
ClaimBuster	602				... to be given any opportunities at all.	0
ClaimBuster	603				I want us to recapture that image.	0
ClaimBuster	604				That's how we cut taxes for middle- class families and small businesses.	0
ClaimBuster	605				They will know whether we used those weapons or not.	0
ClaimBuster	606				And I think that we've had enough of a record of letting -- under the guise of revolution -- someone that we thought was a little more right than we would be, letting that person go, and then winding up with totalitarianism, pure and simple, as the alternative.	0
ClaimBuster	607				Everybody knows it's hard work, because there's a determined enemy that's trying to defeat us.	0
ClaimBuster	608				I have a record of appointing judges in the State of Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	609				It holds down the prices of their goods.	1
ClaimBuster	610				I think for a while as a nation we condoned those things we should have condemned.	0
ClaimBuster	611				I talked to the American Ambassador there.	1
ClaimBuster	612				The consequences of defeat, which would result from his plan of withdrawal and according to date certain, regardless of conditions, according to our military leaders, according to every expert, would lead to defeat -- possible defeat, loss of all the fragile sacrifice that we've made of American blood and treasure, which grieves us all.	0
ClaimBuster	613				Let me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue.	0
ClaimBuster	614				And, in addition to that put forward a proposal that was adopted and used throughout my own term of office of selection of - for all judges and district attorneys or prosecuting attorneys, on the basis of merit.	1
ClaimBuster	615				I think that, obviously, she's a capable politician who has, I think, excited the -- a base in the Republican Party.	0
ClaimBuster	616				First thing I want to say is thank you for giving me the chance to be president.	0
ClaimBuster	617				I have proposed a lot of new investments to improve the quality of life for our soldiers, for our men and women in uniform, for their families, for their training.	1
ClaimBuster	618				And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	619				Let me tell you this straight from the shoulder.	0
ClaimBuster	620				It means that we are cracking down on CEOs and making sure that they're not getting bonuses or golden parachutes as a consequence of this package.	0
ClaimBuster	621				We had to stand up against a tyrant.	0
ClaimBuster	622				But you know, they were working pretty hard eight years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	623				Both parties in Washington, the president and the Congress, have cut Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	624				We do not need 4 more years of an economic theory that doesn't work.	0
ClaimBuster	625				And Barbara and I were sitting there before that Democratic convention.	1
ClaimBuster	626				And I regret to say that this administration has even blocked steps that could help us move further along.	0
ClaimBuster	627				But I think in terms of the American people's concern about my commitment, I'm here tonight, folks; I never quit supporting you as you put me on the ballot in the other 26 states; and when you asked me to come back in, I came back in.	0
ClaimBuster	628				He said that two divisions would have to report not ready for duty, and that's not what the joint chiefs say.	1
ClaimBuster	629				Again, a little bit of naivete there.	0
ClaimBuster	630				There are many people who believe that the only way we can get this country turned around is to tax the middle class more and punish them more, but the truth is that middle-class Americans are basically the only group of Americans who've been taxed more in the 1980s and during the last 12 years, even though their incomes have gone down.	1
ClaimBuster	631				And of course, a military action is the last resort.	0
ClaimBuster	632				"So if you're looking at a competitive world, you say to yourself, ""Hey, I do better overseas than I do here in America. """	0
ClaimBuster	633				This is government by stalemate, and we've seen almost a complete breakdown in the proper relationship between the president, who represents this country, and the Congress, who collectively also represent this country.	0
ClaimBuster	634				We have the greatest people on Earth in our military.	0
ClaimBuster	635				On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that we've got to boost American energy production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than they've been in years.	1
ClaimBuster	636				What I was referring to, of course, in the comment that you referred to was the situation in Lebanon.	0
ClaimBuster	637				50 million of you won't receive it.	1
ClaimBuster	638				We're expanding our homestead uh - housing program.	0
ClaimBuster	639				Saudi Arabia, nothing but money.	0
ClaimBuster	640				And we knew where the fuel rods were.	1
ClaimBuster	641				Then we would present a plan to control health care costs and phase in health care coverage for all Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	642				Before I campaigned as a Democrat for a Republican candidate for President, I had already voted for Dwight Eisenhower to be President of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	643				The last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs.	1
ClaimBuster	644				So I just want to try to correct it as we go along.	0
ClaimBuster	645				We offered an amendment to do so.	1
ClaimBuster	646				As president, I will make certain we travel it.	0
ClaimBuster	647				It requires a different kind of leadership style to do it, though.	0
ClaimBuster	648				I want to lower your cost to health care.	0
ClaimBuster	649				Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods.	0
ClaimBuster	650				It's one thing to be certain, but you can be certain and be wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	651				That's what the Duelfer report showed.	1
ClaimBuster	652				This makes it almost impossible for us to have a good health program.	0
ClaimBuster	653				I don't think it's fair to say, you know, whatever it is, that if you haven't been hit by it personally.	0
ClaimBuster	654				That doesn't mean we shouldn't fully enforce laws and fully protect people and fully honor people, which I will do as the President of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	655				The Iranians have a lousy government, so therefore their economy is lousy, even though they have significant oil revenues.	0
ClaimBuster	656				Thirdly, in Bosnia it's a virtual miracle that there has been no return to war and at least there has now been an election.	1
ClaimBuster	657				And it's a personal and private, moral judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	658				You can say you do to the cameras but you don't, unless you've changed your plan here on the stage.	0
ClaimBuster	659				I commend it to anybody.	0
ClaimBuster	660				In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.	1
ClaimBuster	661				It's important for the nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	662				I believe in a sensible arms control approach that brings down these weapons to manageable levels.	0
ClaimBuster	663				We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.	0
ClaimBuster	664				You can also use those accounts for health care or education or a first home.	1
ClaimBuster	665				If you're from Washington, you want to pick and choose winners.	0
ClaimBuster	666				But it's not going to solve the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	667				Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things -- WikiLeaks that just came out.	1
ClaimBuster	668				I see my time is running out here.	0
ClaimBuster	669				In my speech last night I indicated that I thought that Cuba one day again would be free.	1
ClaimBuster	670				And I can't tell you what it means to me at these rallies when I see you and you come up and the look in your eyes -- and I know how you feel and you know how I feel.	0
ClaimBuster	671				The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody.	1
ClaimBuster	672				We uh - streamlined the structure of the court, put in administrative officers, put a unified court system in, required that all uh - severe sentences be reviewed far uniformity.	0
ClaimBuster	673				And I think that's one reason why we need fresh leadership in the White House that can make progress now in bringing peace to the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	674				And for that to happen, we have to strengthen our economy here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	675				And the point is that we become energy independent and we will create millions of jobs -- millions of jobs in America.	0
ClaimBuster	676				You were very much involved -- excuse me.	0
ClaimBuster	677				How would he feel about it?	0
ClaimBuster	678				I mean, you have said before you'd cut the deficit in half.	1
ClaimBuster	679				Well, we're going to be finished by 2014, and when I'm president, we'll make sure we bring our troops out by the end of 2014.	0
ClaimBuster	680				I mean, the fact is that there -- even though no state wants them, there are guns in some schools.	0
ClaimBuster	681				Will you finally touch that defense budget?	0
ClaimBuster	682				I have a plan to cover all children.	0
ClaimBuster	683				We'll have a debate in 4 days and we can talk about this character thing again.	1
ClaimBuster	684				Most small businesses -- 70 percent of the new jobs in America are created by small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	685				Congress has sustained forty-two vetoes.	1
ClaimBuster	686				But I am determined that if ever our men are called on, they should have the best that we can provide in the manner of tools and weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	687				We'll pass on the American dream to our children, and I will not leave our children a situation that they have today.	0
ClaimBuster	688				In fact, in my ten-year budget proposal I've set aside more than twice as much for this purpose as Governor Bush has in his proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	689				I think we have to demonstrate some flexibility and I think the FDA is attempting to do so now in trying to make it possible for new and experimental drugs to be available to people who are at risk at AIDS and I would hope that we could bring that kind of a policy to bear beginning in January.	1
ClaimBuster	690				But I think even more relevant is my record at home.	0
ClaimBuster	691				That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.	1
ClaimBuster	692				I think you should vote for Mr. Nixon.	0
ClaimBuster	693				But when you look -- and Chicago's not the only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places.	0
ClaimBuster	694				And the prosecutions are up by about 68 percent -- I believe -- is the number.	1
ClaimBuster	695				And these old boys are not going to quit easy.	0
ClaimBuster	696				The issue of nationalism - the recognition, he says, that every major problem confronting us is global, and cannot be solved by nationalism here or elsewhere - that is chauvinistic, that is parochial, that is as anachronistic as states' rights was in the days of Jefferson Davis.	1
ClaimBuster	697				And as I just told you, there's going to be a summit of the Arab nations.	1
ClaimBuster	698				They're created in the private sector.	1
ClaimBuster	699				And the way I pay for it -- I'm not fiscally irresponsible -- is I roll back the tax cut this president so fiercely wants to defend, the one for him and me and Charlie.	1
ClaimBuster	700				Andrea, why do people who want balanced budgets or to bring the deficit down always go to those programs which tend to benefit people of very modest means?	0
ClaimBuster	701				"I was hunting in Iowa last year with a sheriff from one of the counties there, and he pointed to a house in back of us, and said, ""See the house over?"	1
ClaimBuster	702				You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way.	0
ClaimBuster	703				And today, you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what Republicanism represents in this country today.	0
ClaimBuster	704				And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch-and-go situation.	1
ClaimBuster	705				I have three very special people with me tonight: My wife, Elizabeth; my daughter, Robin, who has never let me down, and a fellow named Frank Carafa from New York, along with Ollie Manninen who helped me out in the mountains of Italy a few years back.	1
ClaimBuster	706				Go home and look in the mirror.	0
ClaimBuster	707				I'm glad you raised that, and it's a -- it's a critical issue.	0
ClaimBuster	708				We've not only kept peace for our own country, but we've been able to extend the benefits of peace to others.	0
ClaimBuster	709				And you have to make decisions even when it's against your own interest.	0
ClaimBuster	710				They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else.	0
ClaimBuster	711				Firehouses don't have enough firefighters in them.	0
ClaimBuster	712				I would support the Orrin Hatch version of it, not the Senator Kennedy version.	0
ClaimBuster	713				I've kept that promise and if you'll vote for me, then I promise I'll fight just as hard in a second term.	0
ClaimBuster	714				You ask the Strunks whose plan makes more sense.	0
ClaimBuster	715				And that's why the Congress, including the Republicans, have not gone along with the President's recommendations.	1
ClaimBuster	716				We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable.	0
ClaimBuster	717				I have a fearless forecast.	0
ClaimBuster	718				And the reason is because of its people, because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that she's gotten; because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn't lay off workers during a recession.	1
ClaimBuster	719				The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board should be independent.	0
ClaimBuster	720				If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it's like a national catastrophe.	0
ClaimBuster	721				I indicated under oath that the initiative that I took was at the request of the ranking members of the House Banking and Currency Committee on the Republican side, which was a legitimate request and a proper response by me.	1
ClaimBuster	722				I don't think we need them to remain strong.	0
ClaimBuster	723				It recognizes that the government has a responsibility to get the farmer out of the trouble he presently is in because the government got him into it.	0
ClaimBuster	724				This was an effort that was made by the attorney general and myself, working with the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	725				But you know, Lloyd Bentsen jumped on Dan Quayle, when Dan Quayle said, he's had roughly the same amount of experience.	1
ClaimBuster	726				"If the president had shown the patience to go through another round of resolution, to sit down with those leaders, say, ""What do you need, what do you need now, how much more will it take to get you to join us?"""	0
ClaimBuster	727				We also have to see that all of the people of the United States - the tremendous talents that our people have - are used adequately.	0
ClaimBuster	728				You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	729				The only reason it's not happening is because Governor Romney's allies in Congress have held the 98 percent hostage because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	730				Fifty percent of small business income taxes are paid by small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	731				I ask everybody to look at my economic ideas and 9 Nobel prize winners and over 500 economists and hundreds of business people, including a lot of Republicans said, this is the way you've got to go.	1
ClaimBuster	732				If we fail, then freedom fails.	0
ClaimBuster	733				But I think this is indicative of what I would do.	0
ClaimBuster	734				I think they've engaged in an evil behavior and I think that it is important that we understand they're not the old Soviet Union but they still have nationalist impulses that I think are very dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	735				I'll tell you what kind of judges he'll put on.	0
ClaimBuster	736				And in the process, as a result of that will and that decision and that toughness, we now have ancient enemies talking peace in the Middle East.	1
ClaimBuster	737				But 11 million new jobs and everything, I mean the President can't take credit for everything that governors are doing, whether that's happening in New York City when it comes to the murder rate and then not be responsible for the bad things that happen, whether it's drug use or something else in America.	0
ClaimBuster	738				This is not enough; it should be more.	0
ClaimBuster	739				The whole th- the United States now has a treaty - which I voted for in the United States Senate in 1955 - to defend Formosa and the Pescadores Island.	1
ClaimBuster	740				And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse.	0
ClaimBuster	741				We've spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	742				I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	743				But now we need both that kind of discipline and the resources and the consistent leadership that allows this country to catch up in education and science and training.	0
ClaimBuster	744				That's another way to improve the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	745				I learned how to get along on the other side of the aisle.	0
ClaimBuster	746				It's the private sector that creates jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	747				You know, I wasn't going to say this at all, but I can't help it.	0
ClaimBuster	748				I don't want American workers subsidizing the loss of their own job.	0
ClaimBuster	749				And we can do it again, if we take politics out of it.	0
ClaimBuster	750				We live in a world where what you earn depends on what you can learn, where the average 18- year-old will change jobs 8 times in a lifetime and where none of us can promise any of you that what you now do for a living is absolutely safe from now on.	1
ClaimBuster	751				And I am going to keep that Social Security Trust Fund sound and keep our commitment to the elderly and maybe down the line, maybe when you get two decades or one into the next century, you're going to have to take another look at it, but not now.	0
ClaimBuster	752				His whole deal is you've gotta be for it or against it, you can't make it better.	0
ClaimBuster	753				But I don't know Putin.	1
ClaimBuster	754				The role of government: Look behind us.	0
ClaimBuster	755				$89 billion last year to the top 1 percent of Americans, but kids lost their after-school programs.	1
ClaimBuster	756				And so we said: Let's raise the standards.	1
ClaimBuster	757				Secondly, we got upset when he took the whole thing, but to the ordinary American out there who doesn't know where the oil fields are in Kuwait, they're near the border.	1
ClaimBuster	758				Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world.	1
ClaimBuster	759				But I went anyway because I knew if I didn't, somebody else in the small town of Carthage, Tennessee, would have to go in my place.	0
ClaimBuster	760				They should have been doing this for years.	0
ClaimBuster	761				Well, it's in this committee or it's got this sponsor.	0
ClaimBuster	762				Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady Bill.	1
ClaimBuster	763				And recently the Federal Trade Commission pointed out that some of these entertainment companies have warned parents that the material is inappropriate for children, and then they've turned around behind the backs of the parents and advertised that same adult material directly to children.	1
ClaimBuster	764				And again I know Senator D'Amato I think may have had a hearing or two on Whitewater, I can't remember, but he's not my general chairman, he's a friend of mine.	1
ClaimBuster	765				I've broken up organized crime.	1
ClaimBuster	766				I can see why people at your workplace think he changes positions a lot, because he does.	1
ClaimBuster	767				We will commit more over time to help.	0
ClaimBuster	768				Why don't you interrupt her?	0
ClaimBuster	769				We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if it's attacked.	1
ClaimBuster	770				I believe that choice is a woman's choice.	0
ClaimBuster	771				But if you take it in percentages, then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board.	0
ClaimBuster	772				If we make the use of a gun in the commission.	0
ClaimBuster	773				I think it's the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down.	0
ClaimBuster	774				I think it's very difficult.	0
ClaimBuster	775				And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.	1
ClaimBuster	776				It shouldn't happen in America.	0
ClaimBuster	777				We all assume that the tax cuts will be permanent.	0
ClaimBuster	778				And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn't take donors.	1
ClaimBuster	779				For twenty-five years I served in the Congress under five presidents.	1
ClaimBuster	780				When we talk about child care, and the credits that we're providing.	0
ClaimBuster	781				And I think this is something the American people see.	0
ClaimBuster	782				We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect.	0
ClaimBuster	783				The administration brought a criminal action against the people drilling up there for oil, this massive new resource we have.	1
ClaimBuster	784				And we've got a good strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	785				And I believe that we used our skill.	0
ClaimBuster	786				The auto worker in Toledo who was unemployed when I was elected and now has a great job because we're number one in auto production again.	1
ClaimBuster	787				And Congress could have done that if the budget committees of the Congress, and the Congress as a whole, had not increased the spending that I recommended in the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	788				But had it been done, it's possible we could have avoided the issue.	0
ClaimBuster	789				I was opposing one piece of legislation versus another.	1
ClaimBuster	790				He has consistently denied what is...	1
ClaimBuster	791				Our policemen and women are disrespected.	0
ClaimBuster	792				I think of Dr. Fauci.	0
ClaimBuster	793				Well, I had thought that there was a controversy at the end of the legislative session where the hate crimes law in Texas was -- failed, and that the Byrd family, among others, asked you to support it, Governor, and it died in committee for lack of support.	0
ClaimBuster	794				"I tell the people on the campaign trail, when I asked Laura to marry me, she said, ""Fine, just so long as I never have to give a speech."	1
ClaimBuster	795				Senator McCain and I actually agree on something.	1
ClaimBuster	796				You can keep your choice of doctor.	0
ClaimBuster	797				It's time to have a leader that doesn't put off tomorrow what we should do today.	0
ClaimBuster	798				How's it going to affect my house?	0
ClaimBuster	799				In his first year, I was just getting -- licking my wounds from having been beaten by John McCain, all right.	0
ClaimBuster	800				Obamacare is a total disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	801				So this is who Donald Trump is.	0
ClaimBuster	802				I would be writing a letter to people who know everything there is to know about us.	0
ClaimBuster	803				I think under presidents For- uh - Nixon and Eisenhower they passed about 60 to 75 percent of their legislation.	1
ClaimBuster	804				And free and fair trade is the answer, not protection.	0
ClaimBuster	805				They have to understand we want to trade with them.	0
ClaimBuster	806				And Democrats and Republicans alike, I think, acknowledge his expertise there.	0
ClaimBuster	807				Oil production is up, natural gas production is up, and, most importantly, we're also starting to build cars that are more efficient.	1
ClaimBuster	808				Iraq was Iran's mortal enemy.	1
ClaimBuster	809				And in this election, America has to make an important choice.	1
ClaimBuster	810				But because we had no allies and because it was very unclear that we could actually accomplish what we would want to accomplish about putting military forces there, I think it was the right thing not to jump in, as heartbreaking as it was, but I think we should have come in much quicker with the humanitarian mission.	0
ClaimBuster	811				I think that it's been very well...	0
ClaimBuster	812				But first of all, this is a nation of immigrants.	1
ClaimBuster	813				So what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support.	0
ClaimBuster	814				We need to do more.	0
ClaimBuster	815				And I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice.	0
ClaimBuster	816				My wife is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister.	1
ClaimBuster	817				Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name.	0
ClaimBuster	818				Remember when people almost used to walk across the street rather than have a contact with somebody who was in Vietnam?	0
ClaimBuster	819				It's because they have lost their industry.	0
ClaimBuster	820				It is going to cause scarcity in world markets because there are at least five reputable studies, one even by the American Petroleum Institute itself, that, I think, clearly indicate that somewhere along around the end of the present decade, total world demand for oil is simply going to exceed total available supplies.	1
ClaimBuster	821				You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you.	1
ClaimBuster	822				And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	823				And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she's for it.	1
ClaimBuster	824				My father was a small-businessman.	1
ClaimBuster	825				And if they don't do it, we're gonna ask for tougher authority in the hands of the FTC on the false and deceptive advertising.	0
ClaimBuster	826				I mean, I had a friend who said you don't just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, all right?	0
ClaimBuster	827				We sent it to the Clinton Administration for implementation, and they waited three and a half years.	1
ClaimBuster	828				"""I think that makes sense."	0
ClaimBuster	829				And that's, like, no growth.	0
ClaimBuster	830				For the last eight years I've served on the National Security Council, and when the conflict came up in Bosnia, I saw a genocide in the heart of Europe with the most violent war on the continent of Europe since World War II.	1
ClaimBuster	831				What kind of judgment sense has your chief education adviser now in jail in Massachusetts?	0
ClaimBuster	832				And I have every right in the world to defend my record and positions.	0
ClaimBuster	833				And it is one of the things I've learned in the White House, is that there's enormous pressure on the president, and he cannot wilt under that pressure.	0
ClaimBuster	834				We're getting ready to dismantle the airlines industry in our country, and none of you know it.	1
ClaimBuster	835				She's got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	836				If there's more time for gridlock and talk and finger pointing, I'm the wrong man.	0
ClaimBuster	837				I don't go along with it.	0
ClaimBuster	838				And if the Congress won't do it, if they can't get together and negotiate how to do that, then you'd have a sequester across the board.	0
ClaimBuster	839				The rest of the world practices 21st century capitalism.	0
ClaimBuster	840				Now, they look at us and say, Is it a good idea to be with America?	0
ClaimBuster	841				Sorry, time for diplomacy is over.	0
ClaimBuster	842				Let's take Mr. Bush for the moment at his word -- he's right, we don't have any evidence at least that our government did tell Saddam Hussein he could have that part of Kuwait.	1
ClaimBuster	843				As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people.	1
ClaimBuster	844				And we have -- look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me.	1
ClaimBuster	845				We want a world that's stable.	0
ClaimBuster	846				The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul.	0
ClaimBuster	847				But it's also tremendously important to bear in mind that when you pour in money without pouring in technical assistance at w- as well, that you have a disastrous situation.	0
ClaimBuster	848				What has happened to you?	0
ClaimBuster	849				We initiated a very fine urban renewal program, working with the mayors, the governors, and other interested officials.	0
ClaimBuster	850				It is a commitment that we have to meet if we're going to protect the security of Western Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	851				Spain is a NATO ally.	1
ClaimBuster	852				That includes oil; it includes all kinds of minerals; it includes everything within the range of taxation.	0
ClaimBuster	853				Now, it is absolutely true that we cannot just meet these challenges militarily.	0
ClaimBuster	854				But I believe America is the greatest country in human history because we have maintained freedom and increasing prosperity by relentlessly pushing the barriers of knowledge, the barriers of the present, always moving into the future.	0
ClaimBuster	855				Let me say again, there is no more important responsibility for the president than to say if you believe in the constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence, that's all we need to know.	0
ClaimBuster	856				And his forecast for the next four years is more deficits, almost that large.	1
ClaimBuster	857				They would not have materialized for about nine to eighteen months.	0
ClaimBuster	858				So, I would say somebody in the format of uh - Justice Stevens would be the kind of an individual that I would uh - select in the future, as I did him in the past.	0
ClaimBuster	859				He made it illegal, illegal for Medicare to do what the V.A.	1
ClaimBuster	860				I can remember being in upstate New York talking to FBI agents that helped bust a Lackawanna cell up there.	0
ClaimBuster	861				But when Joe McCarthy went around this country attacking people's patriotism he was wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	862				We both believe that, as lawyers -- I'm a lawyer, too.	0
ClaimBuster	863				And as a consequence, you had 46 states around the country who have made a real difference.	1
ClaimBuster	864				We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.	0
ClaimBuster	865				And not only did she interest me, I guess you would say it was love at first sight.	0
ClaimBuster	866				One is to reduce spending -- controlling that mandatory spending.	0
ClaimBuster	867				Ours are permanent, ours is a good plan.	0
ClaimBuster	868				Senator Obama's name was not on that letter.	1
ClaimBuster	869				We do have a serious problem in our culture.	0
ClaimBuster	870				I talk to small businesses across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	871				So far, Mr. Ford has not responded.	1
ClaimBuster	872				But I hope the next Administration - and if I have anything to do with it, the next Administration will - make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing, control of nuclear weapons, if possible, control of outer space, free from weapons, and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels.	0
ClaimBuster	873				I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.	0
ClaimBuster	874				We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration.	0
ClaimBuster	875				I know one thing about the position of president, it's the only position in our Constitution that is filled by an individual who is given the responsibility to fight not just for one state or one district or the well-connected or wealthy, but to fight for all of the people, including especially those who most need somebody who will stand up and take on whatever powerful forces might stand in the way.	0
ClaimBuster	876				This is a formidable force.	0
ClaimBuster	877				We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy.	1
ClaimBuster	878				"'', he said, ""Cut those things I asked for but didn't get.''"	1
ClaimBuster	879				See, an educated child is one much more likely to be hopeful and optimistic.	0
ClaimBuster	880				President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan.	1
ClaimBuster	881				I would like to thank Governor Bush for participating, and I would like to say I'm happy to be here with Tipper and our family.	0
ClaimBuster	882				I would oppose that, but I think were on the right track in agriculture and I am very very encouraged.	0
ClaimBuster	883				I want small businesses -- and by the way, the small businesses that we're talking about would receive an increase in their taxes right now.	1
ClaimBuster	884				Thirdly, I don't believe that the government contracts division is operated with vigor.	0
ClaimBuster	885				The plan says we'll train Iraqi soldiers so they can do the hard work, and we are.	1
ClaimBuster	886				And eliminated probably more quickly than our plan, but we wanted to be so conservative with it, that people would see how.	0
ClaimBuster	887				Thank you for doing what you're doing.	0
ClaimBuster	888				I have participated in the discussions leading to the decisions in this Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	889				But one mistake he's made is fuel efficiency standards at 40 to 45 miles a gallon will throw many auto workers out of work, and you can't have it both ways.	1
ClaimBuster	890				This is another example of misplaced priorities.	0
ClaimBuster	891				And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front -- that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan.	1
ClaimBuster	892				Number two, trade -- I'll crack down on China, President Bush didn't.	1
ClaimBuster	893				But you were in contact -- excuse me.	0
ClaimBuster	894				Now, I think I have to let Senator Dole speak for himself.	0
ClaimBuster	895				I'm optimistic we'll achieve -- I know we won't achieve if we send mixed signals.	0
ClaimBuster	896				And so I would say that the concept of the Dukakis family has my great respect.	0
ClaimBuster	897				Secondly, what's he going to do to provide fair employment?	0
ClaimBuster	898				That way we can invest in the research and technology that's always kept us at the cutting edge.	0
ClaimBuster	899				We have to be firm and strong.	0
ClaimBuster	900				Productivity in the first half of 1980 was down a minus 2 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	901				No, it doesn't speak for itself, Mr. Vice President, it speaks for the fact that there are certain rules in this that we all agree to, but evidently rules don't mean anything.	0
ClaimBuster	902				Now, this is the most dangerous technology that we possess.	0
ClaimBuster	903				Thirdly, we ought to have boot camps for first-time nonviolent offenders so they can get discipline and treatment and education and get reconnected to the community before they're severed and sent to prison, where they can learn how to be first class criminals.	0
ClaimBuster	904				I think it is exports that have saved us when we're in a global slowdown, a connected global slowdown, a recession in some countries.	0
ClaimBuster	905				You can't have a free market work if you don't have regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	906				I think the real issue in this campaign, and that which you must decide on November second, is whether you should vote for his promise or my performance in two years in the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	907				I believe there's fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system.	0
ClaimBuster	908				Senator Richard Lugar, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that the handling of the reconstruction aid in Iraq by this administration has been incompetent.	1
ClaimBuster	909				We'll continue to build our alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	910				So one of the things that I have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing.	1
ClaimBuster	911				Well, you know, let me just...	0
ClaimBuster	912				He's trying to attack me.	1
ClaimBuster	913				That has the benefit of making sure our employers aren't breaking the law as they try to fill their workforce needs.	0
ClaimBuster	914				We've got to invest in science and technology.	0
ClaimBuster	915				The farmers are not the victims of anything this administration has done.	1
ClaimBuster	916				So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down.	0
ClaimBuster	917				It is the best anti-terrorist report written.	0
ClaimBuster	918				We have serious differences with the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	919				And that's not how a commander in chief acts.	0
ClaimBuster	920				And I supported this bill.	1
ClaimBuster	921				Now, Mr. Hankins, I think that the situation that you describe has gotten completely out of hand.	0
ClaimBuster	922				They're tough negotiators, but all previous Presidents have made progress.	1
ClaimBuster	923				And looking around here, at this group here, I suspect there are only three people here who are going to be affected: the president, me, and, Charlie, I'm sorry, you too.	0
ClaimBuster	924				He changes positions on something as fundamental as what you believe in your core, in your heart of hearts, is right in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	925				Did you ask me a question?	0
ClaimBuster	926				Can I respond to that?	0
ClaimBuster	927				I will bring our energy companies back.	0
ClaimBuster	928				But we faced it and we did it, and we believe it's fair, shared sacrifice.	0
ClaimBuster	929				The reason Indochina was preserved was the result of the Geneva Conference which Indochina.	1
ClaimBuster	930				Well, that's not exactly an accurate description of what happened.	0
ClaimBuster	931				They investigated every single one of my children.	1
ClaimBuster	932				Every time our interest rates go up one percent, that adds 28 billion dollars to the deficit or to the debt.	1
ClaimBuster	933				But I'm confident, now that General Petraeus is in the new position of command, that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops -- and, by the way, there have been 20,000 additional troops, from 32,000 to 53,000, and there needs to be more.	1
ClaimBuster	934				And that's an example of the kind of advocacy that we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family.	0
ClaimBuster	935				If people don't have the stomach to fix these problems, I think it's a good time to face it, November.	0
ClaimBuster	936				The second thing is this all assumes that the Soviets wouldn't respond in kind.	0
ClaimBuster	937				I can't think of any.	0
ClaimBuster	938				So how do we deal with it?	0
ClaimBuster	939				I believe college tuition up to $10,000 per year ought to be tax deductible so middle-class families can choose to send their children to college.	0
ClaimBuster	940				The enemy understands a free Iraq will be a major defeat in their ideology of hatred.	0
ClaimBuster	941				One of the things that happens when you're a governor, at least oftentimes you have to make tough decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	942				And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right.	1
ClaimBuster	943				Number two, with regards to Iran and the threat of Iran, there's no question but that a nuclear Iran, a nuclear-capable Iran is unacceptable to America.	0
ClaimBuster	944				And it's referred to as an assault weapon ban, but it had, at the signing of the bill, both the pro-gun and the anti-gun people came together, because it provided opportunities for both that both wanted.	1
ClaimBuster	945				We have a long distance yet to travel in terms of fairness in America.	0
ClaimBuster	946				We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20-25 billion a year, which is what we've been doing under this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	947				I want to make sure that it stays in that relationship.	0
ClaimBuster	948				Humvees -- 10,000 out of 12,000 Humvees that are over there aren't armored.	1
ClaimBuster	949				In other states, we've done it.	1
ClaimBuster	950				We have a separate and unequal school system in the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	951				The -- I haven't seen that, in my commercials?	0
ClaimBuster	952				I don't think they ought to have special rights, but I think they ought to have the same rights.	0
ClaimBuster	953				That's why we doubled clean -- clean energy production like wind and solar and biofuels.	1
ClaimBuster	954				How many of you like it?	0
ClaimBuster	955				Some people say that's a hatchet.	0
ClaimBuster	956				You know, my hardest -- the hardest part of the job is to know that I committed the troops in harm's way and then do the best I can to provide comfort for the loved ones who lost a son or a daughter or a husband or wife.	1
ClaimBuster	957				You see, I don't think we need to tax more and spend more, and then say that's going to make the problem better.	0
ClaimBuster	958				As a matter of fact, it's growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement.	1
ClaimBuster	959				It also defined marriage as between a man and woman.	1
ClaimBuster	960				"And as President Kennedy said when he ran for president, he said, ""I'm not running to be a Catholic president."	1
ClaimBuster	961				Here a very small investment of taxpayer's money - in the housing field can bring large numbers of extra jobs, and the guarantee of mortgage loans, and the uh - putting forward of uh - two-0-two programs for housing for older people and so forth to cut down the roughly 20 percent unemployment that now exists in the - in the construction industry.	1
ClaimBuster	962				But short of the constitutional amendment, and within the confines of the Supreme Court rulings, I'll do everything I can to minimize the need for abortions with better sex education, family planning, with better adoptive procedures.	0
ClaimBuster	963				And everybody knows, including the Wall Street Journal, hardly a friend of the Democratic party of this administration, that the '82 tax increase he sponsored in inflation-adjusted dollars was the biggest tax increase in American history.	1
ClaimBuster	964				But we know we've got lots of work to do.	0
ClaimBuster	965				We got intimately involved in building NATO and other structures there.	1
ClaimBuster	966				But let's not cut into the muscle, and let's not cut down our insurance policy, which is participation of American forces in NATO, the greatest peace- keeping organization ever made.	1
ClaimBuster	967				So I would think we can expedite the problem there.	0
ClaimBuster	968				It's now over $10 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	969				And that's where we're going right now unless we finally get off this spending and borrowing binge.	0
ClaimBuster	970				The key is job training, education, investments in health care and education, environment, retirement security.	0
ClaimBuster	971				And a lot of you I think are worried about your jobs, your pensions, your retirement accounts, your ability to send your child or your grandchild to college.	0
ClaimBuster	972				And I think if we want to continue -- as I do -- to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it.	0
ClaimBuster	973				Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift.	0
ClaimBuster	974				We allow you -- if you choose to, you don't have to -- but we give you broader competition to allow you to buy into the same health care plan that senators and congressmen give themselves.	1
ClaimBuster	975				And it's going to be hard, it's going to be important to rebuild that coalition to keep the pressure on him.	0
ClaimBuster	976				The President didn't have much to do about it.	0
ClaimBuster	977				But here's what I do know.	0
ClaimBuster	978				Mr. Dulles has suggested it's from two to three times as great as ours.	1
ClaimBuster	979				The program - the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon-Javits program - would have cost, if fully used uh - six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state.	1
ClaimBuster	980				They look at America's commitments around the world and they see what's happening, and they say, well, OK. Is America going to be strong?	0
ClaimBuster	981				That's not the position he's taking.	1
ClaimBuster	982				There's a special protocol recently been passed that allows for inspections.	1
ClaimBuster	983				We've looked at your tax proposals.	0
ClaimBuster	984				All three you mentioned are compelling national security requirements.	0
ClaimBuster	985				You keep your own insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	986				And I look forward to discussing exactly how we're going to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	987				They'll make things happen to create jobs here in the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	988				I'm not going to ask them.	0
ClaimBuster	989				I visited a Chrysler dealership in Tokyo.	1
ClaimBuster	990				You don't see Margaret Tutwiler sitting in there with me today.	1
ClaimBuster	991				Six increases in the payroll tax -- that means people with incomes of $51,000 a year or less pay a disproportionally high share of the federal tax burden, which is why I want some middle-class tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	992				And women have respect for me.	0
ClaimBuster	993				I have a great company.	0
ClaimBuster	994				We - uh believe that uh you can revise the federal criminal code, which has not been revised in a good many years.	1
ClaimBuster	995				We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.	0
ClaimBuster	996				I believe that public service is honorable.	0
ClaimBuster	997				He has a 15-year-old daughter named Caley, who is in Sarasota High School.	1
ClaimBuster	998				They do all the spending, they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime.	0
ClaimBuster	999				And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	1000				It's about Kipp Academy in Houston, Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	1001				"That's why the slogan of my campaign is ""Stronger Together,"" because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals -- and I've set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else."	0
ClaimBuster	1002				That's part of what took us from deficits to surplus.	1
ClaimBuster	1003				Well, I think when I think of heroes, I think back, not presently, Ann.	0
ClaimBuster	1004				I believe that -- I believe I made a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	1005				Well, I certainly hope not.	0
ClaimBuster	1006				And we're going to put our laboratories and our colleges and our universities to work.	0
ClaimBuster	1007				We have more at stake in space satellites than they do.	0
ClaimBuster	1008				And yet the president who talks about No Child Left Behind refused to fully fund -- by $28 billion -- that particular program so you can make a difference in the lives of those young people.	1
ClaimBuster	1009				And I've done everything I could in my public life to overcome racial divisions.	0
ClaimBuster	1010				They've taken over the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	1011				"And we ought to go back to a little bit of Ronald Reagan's ""trust, but verify,"" and certainly not sit down across the table from -- without precondition, as Senator Obama said he did twice, I mean, it's just dangerous."	1
ClaimBuster	1012				... withdrawal would be dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	1013				Our diplomatic isolation needs to be tougher.	0
ClaimBuster	1014				That's what I'm all about.	0
ClaimBuster	1015				Now here's what we need to do.	0
ClaimBuster	1016				I do not mean by that that one party is a war party and the other party is a peace party.	0
ClaimBuster	1017				And we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago, Chris.	0
ClaimBuster	1018				Are we better off when we deemphasize our values in human rights?	0
ClaimBuster	1019				Make the Soviets pay for their irresponsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	1020				I believe America's best days are ahead of us because I believe that the future belongs to freedom, not to fear.	0
ClaimBuster	1021				This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country, where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies.	1
ClaimBuster	1022				But at the same time, if you want to get off Medicare, get back in the mainstream, we're going to provide jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	1023				I believe in free trade.	0
ClaimBuster	1024				I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars.	0
ClaimBuster	1025				This is a difficult and sensitive matter.	0
ClaimBuster	1026				There are several issues in which, frankly, Joe Biden and I openly and honestly disagreed on national security policy, and he's been wrong on a number of the major ones.	1
ClaimBuster	1027				It was a committee chaired by the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a Democrat.	1
ClaimBuster	1028				And the United States will maintain our national security interest in the Panama Canal.	0
ClaimBuster	1029				We have five treaties with Latin America, including the one setting up the Organization of American States in Bogota in 1948, in which we have agreed not to intervene in the internal affairs of any other American country - and they as well have agreed to do likewise.	1
ClaimBuster	1030				And I think it's been unfortunate, but it's happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top.	1
ClaimBuster	1031				And as a private citizen, believe me, you are looked on as a major nuisance.	0
ClaimBuster	1032				In 1992, before I became President, the Congress passed the Cuba Democracy Act and I enforced it vigorously.	1
ClaimBuster	1033				Well, a lot of what this campaign is about, it seems to me Bernie, goes to the question of values.	0
ClaimBuster	1034				When you cut capital gains, you put people to work.	0
ClaimBuster	1035				Jim, thank you very much.	0
ClaimBuster	1036				Because it isn't a question of how much the federal government spends; it isn't a question of which government does the most.	0
ClaimBuster	1037				He has all the conspiracy theories...	0
ClaimBuster	1038				People listening out there know the benefits of the tax cuts we passed.	0
ClaimBuster	1039				I just cited an example of the administration just unilaterally acting without any input.	1
ClaimBuster	1040				"But to somehow say that group of young women who said ""Military wives for McCain"" are somehow saying anything derogatory about you, but anything -- and those veterans that wear those hats that say ""World War II, Vietnam, Korea, Iraq,"" I'm not going to stand for people saying that the people that come to my rallies are anything but the most dedicated, patriotic men and women that are in this nation and they're great citizens."	0
ClaimBuster	1041				Whether that helps or not, I don't know.	0
ClaimBuster	1042				Not at all, Mr. Trewhitt, and I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	1043				But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked.	0
ClaimBuster	1044				And I think it's a disgrace that so far Mr. Ford's administration has blocked the passage of legislation that would've revealed by law every instance of the boycott and it would've prevented the boycott from continuing.	1
ClaimBuster	1045				You had a whole bunch of oil companies who had leases on public lands that they weren't using.	1
ClaimBuster	1046				And then I thought to myself, what are they going to say about us, what are those people 100 years from now going to think?	0
ClaimBuster	1047				High tech executives in Northern California.	1
ClaimBuster	1048				See, there's a lot I don't understand.	0
ClaimBuster	1049				I would like to mention that a couple days ago Senator Obama was out in Ohio and he had an encounter with a guy who's a plumber, his name is Joe Wurzelbacher.	1
ClaimBuster	1050				But government mandates I -- I'm always a little nervous about.	0
ClaimBuster	1051				So let's come back to harsh reality, and what I -- you know, everybody says, gee, Perot, you're tough.	0
ClaimBuster	1052				And so he would be doing exactly the wrong thing.	0
ClaimBuster	1053				There may be some other statute that was already on the books, but certainly the advocates of the hate crimes law felt that a tough new law was needed.	0
ClaimBuster	1054				I don't think I'd have to go against that pledge.	0
ClaimBuster	1055				But it started for me in the last eight years when I had the honor of casting the tie-breaking vote to end the old economic plan here at home and put into place a new economic plan that has helped us to make some progress, 22 million new jobs, the greatest prosperity ever.	1
ClaimBuster	1056				"But I am not going to pick out one and, in advance, hypothetically say, ""Oh, yes, we would send troops there.''"	0
ClaimBuster	1057				But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion.	1
ClaimBuster	1058				"I mean, this is the president who said ""There were weapons of mass destruction,"" said ""Mission accomplished,"" said we could fight the war on the cheap -- none of which were true."	1
ClaimBuster	1059				And if he should ever become uh - the president of the United States, with his vast experience as member the House and a member of the Senate, as well as a vice president, I think he would do an outstanding job as president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	1060				We have to double the size of the Afghan army.	0
ClaimBuster	1061				In the last two years, we have restored integrity in the White House, and we've set high standards in the executive branch of the government.	0
ClaimBuster	1062				A promise made will be a promise kept should I be fortunate enough to become your president.	0
ClaimBuster	1063				And if you watch it Thursday, Friday, Saturday this week, you'll get more.	0
ClaimBuster	1064				"His main strategy during the Republican primary was to say, ""We're going to encourage self-deportation."""	1
ClaimBuster	1065				You know, here's what I would say.	0
ClaimBuster	1066				All right, here we go again.	0
ClaimBuster	1067				Let me tell you, I'm going to force them right back into their country.	0
ClaimBuster	1068				Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago?	0
ClaimBuster	1069				They don't reach those goals.	0
ClaimBuster	1070				This permits a company to create uh - a dummy corporation, to export their products, and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them.	1
ClaimBuster	1071				Mine are words, and his was action.	0
ClaimBuster	1072				In addition to that, the build-up of military forces is good for our country because we've got to have military strength to preserve the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	1073				We were there for the better part of a year.	1
ClaimBuster	1074				OK. We need to create jobs here.	0
ClaimBuster	1075				This president chose a tax cut over homeland security.	1
ClaimBuster	1076				We had a good neighbor policy, yes.	0
ClaimBuster	1077				But -- but let me -- let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that.	1
ClaimBuster	1078				There are plenty of places to cut.	0
ClaimBuster	1079				The only thing I would say about that is, I think that on the economy, Mr. Bush said for a long time there was no recession, and then said it would be better to do nothing than to have a compromise effort with the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	1080				Well, let me just say I would...	0
ClaimBuster	1081				And my plan say why don't we pass 1.3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills?	0
ClaimBuster	1082				They could borrow the money and pay it back as a percentage of their income or with a couple of years of service to our nation here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	1083				But we can't just provide moral support.	0
ClaimBuster	1084				So all federal funds, instead of going to the -- to the state or to the school district, I'd have go, if you will, follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their -- their -- their student.	0
ClaimBuster	1085				When I said that we had to make sure that China was not flooding our domestic market with cheap tires, Governor Romney said I was being protectionist; that it wouldn't be helpful to American workers.	1
ClaimBuster	1086				But that's not what I believe.	0
ClaimBuster	1087				But then if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the Russians and then we'll have to meet our responsibilities to the security of the United States, and there may have to be testing underground.	0
ClaimBuster	1088				I believe we can do it.	0
ClaimBuster	1089				The people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	1090				I don't understand extending the no-fly zone in the south when the trouble was in the north.	0
ClaimBuster	1091				We've seen in the Nicaraguan example a policy that has actually hurt us, strengthened our opposition, and undermined the moral authority of our country in that region.	0
ClaimBuster	1092				Actually, Mr. President, in 1997 we fixed Medicare, and I was one of the people involved in it.	1
ClaimBuster	1093				But I tell you also now, Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	1094				I'm happy to say that, in contrast to that, the Anderson-Lucey platform for America, program for the 80s, has devoted considerable time, and in very specific detail, we have talked about two things that ought to be done to aid urban America.	1
ClaimBuster	1095				It's not driven by politics.	1
ClaimBuster	1096				We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s.	1
ClaimBuster	1097				The fact is that businesses in America today are paying the second highest tax rate of anywhere in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	1098				I believe in opening doors.	0
ClaimBuster	1099				There isn't one country in the Middle East that now endorses the Eisenhower Doctrine.	1
ClaimBuster	1100				There have been several indications that our prestige is not as high as it once was.	0
ClaimBuster	1101				In fact, I'm for shrinking the size of government.	1
ClaimBuster	1102				If it wasn't, they get their 10 minutes of fame.	0
ClaimBuster	1103				We have moved in Latin America very effectively, and I'd also like to point this out: Senator Kennedy complains very appropriately about our inadequate ra- radio broadcasts for Latin America.	1
ClaimBuster	1104				The farm income in America is high.	1
ClaimBuster	1105				But we also have to take demand seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	1106				These appointments are for life.	1
ClaimBuster	1107				I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now.	0
ClaimBuster	1108				I want to finally get something done on Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	1109				Let me get out of your way here.	0
ClaimBuster	1110				The Soviet Union has been engaged in the biggest military buildup in the history of man at the same time that we tried the policy of unilateral disarmament, of weakness, if you will.	1
ClaimBuster	1111				Over the long term, in order for us to compete with China, we've also got to make sure, though, that we're taking -- taking care of business here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	1112				I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983, and it is a combination of planned reduction of the tax increase that Carter has built into the economy, and that's what he's counting on for his plan.	0
ClaimBuster	1113				You just gave a speech a few weeks ago in which you said we should still have troops in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	1114				But it seems to me if we start to take choices away from people and if we drive them into one type care, eliminate fee-for-service altogether or eliminate the fact you can go to your own doctor, you have to go somewhere else, then I think we've taken a giant step backward in the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	1115				You can have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, which the President opposed and defeated.	1
ClaimBuster	1116				I'm not a politician, but I think I could go to Washington in a week and get everybody holding hands and get this bill signed because I talk to the Democratic leaders and they want it.	0
ClaimBuster	1117				I don't think he was misleading.	0
ClaimBuster	1118				Well, we have come to that position.	0
ClaimBuster	1119				But I would like to call the attention of the people to the fact that that so-called simple amendment would be used by mischievous men to destroy discriminations that properly belong, by law, to women respecting the physical differences between the two sexes, labor laws that protect them against things that would be physically harmful to them.	0
ClaimBuster	1120				But I do believe that we have to change our policies with Pakistan.	0
ClaimBuster	1121				So that one we came away with in creating jobs for the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	1122				I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders.	1
ClaimBuster	1123				You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be?	0
ClaimBuster	1124				I committed that I would rein in the excesses of Wall Street, and we passed the toughest Wall Street reforms since the 1930s.	1
ClaimBuster	1125				And we'll make whatever adjustment is necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	1126				Those are the people who ought to be in jail.	0
ClaimBuster	1127				It's a good package, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	1128				Now, long ago, I warned about Vladimir Putin.	1
ClaimBuster	1129				You'll actually do a better job, I think, of passing on the moral responsibility that is expressed in your question.	0
ClaimBuster	1130				And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?	0
ClaimBuster	1131				I was able for two years when I was in, a very young boy to go to a Catholic school, but I basically went to public schools all my life.	1
ClaimBuster	1132				I think everybody knows now we are in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	1133				I believe we have a responsibility to care for one another.	0
ClaimBuster	1134				more than doubled, and it rose at a faster rate than spending was rising in the Federal Government.	1
ClaimBuster	1135				That's because it comes at you, not from you.	0
ClaimBuster	1136				And I wish we had time to let me explain.	0
ClaimBuster	1137				And his emissary, I think, came home in 12 hours having heard a very definite nyet.	0
ClaimBuster	1138				This is what this election is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	1139				Bonus plans to keep some of our high-skilled folks in the services and a commander in chief who clearly sets the mission.	0
ClaimBuster	1140				It says, for example, that a woman doesn't have to go through a gate keeper to go to her gynecologist.	1
ClaimBuster	1141				Governor Romney says he wasn't referring to Arizona as a model for the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	1142				We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble.	0
ClaimBuster	1143				But the president made a mistake in invading Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	1144				Let me say again, we did have a drug czar in Arkansas, but he answered to the governor, just like this one answers to the President.	1
ClaimBuster	1145				And as a consequence, Al Qaeda's core leadership has been decimated.	1
ClaimBuster	1146				You know, we are at a defining moment in our history.	0
ClaimBuster	1147				But those are the issues on which we ought to be debating and if we can just put away the flag factories and the balloons and those kinds of thing and get on to a real discussion of these issues, I think we will have a good success.	0
ClaimBuster	1148				We've got ten and a half million new jobs; we've got record numbers of those new small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	1149				I think what really matters is what we can do to build strong families.	0
ClaimBuster	1150				So where else would you raise the revenue to provide this tax relief - would you, in fact, do away with all business deductions, and what other kinds of preferences would you do away with?	0
ClaimBuster	1151				And in my view, this is not the answer to the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	1152				Somebody went to a woman and nearly killed her.	1
ClaimBuster	1153				I can understand why you are, Mr. Mondale, because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	1154				I've been able to set clear goals.	0
ClaimBuster	1155				We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	1156				You know what that is?	0
ClaimBuster	1157				Well, first of all, I want to thank Hofstra University and the people of New York for hosting us tonight and it's wonderful to join Senator McCain again, and thank you, Bob.	0
ClaimBuster	1158				But if we spend and spend and spend, that is going to wrap up the housing market, and we'll go right back to the days of the misery index and malaise that President Reagan and I have overcome - thank God for the United States on that one.	0
ClaimBuster	1159				So now we've dug ourselves out of it, we're standing, but we're not yet running.	0
ClaimBuster	1160				Look at the Republicans that have endorsed me.	0
ClaimBuster	1161				The reason health-care costs are getting higher, one of the principal reasons is that this administration has stood in the way of common-sense efforts that would have reduced the costs.	0
ClaimBuster	1162				You're doing a great job, Tom.	0
ClaimBuster	1163				We need to insist that Arafat send out instructions to halt some of the provocative acts of violence that have been going on.	0
ClaimBuster	1164				I would never give up complete control or practical control of the Panama Canal Zone, but I would continue to negotiate with the Panamanians.	0
ClaimBuster	1165				Governor Carter again contradicts himself.	0
ClaimBuster	1166				Now, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they weren't to be abhorred -- that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment.	1
ClaimBuster	1167				Jim, the president began this segment, so I think I get the last word.	1
ClaimBuster	1168				And so I decided that a better way to approach the issue was to get other nations involved, just besides us.	0
ClaimBuster	1169				We need to go after the leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	1170				That is a rank mischaracterization.	0
ClaimBuster	1171				We had Saddam Hussein trapped.	1
ClaimBuster	1172				We've got to invest in college affordability.	0
ClaimBuster	1173				You judge on the record.	0
ClaimBuster	1174				It must -- as a last resort.	0
ClaimBuster	1175				I just want to get back to this home ownership.	0
ClaimBuster	1176				I didn't care whether he was a Republican or Democrat.	0
ClaimBuster	1177				And taking us back to those kinds of strategies that got us into this mess are not the way that we are going to maintain leadership in the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	1178				So, this has been my feeling about abortion, that we have a problem now to determine -- and all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being.	0
ClaimBuster	1179				I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward.	0
ClaimBuster	1180				Forty-four Democrats voted for it, one Republican voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	1181				And that stands in contrast to my worthy opponent's plan, which will increase the size of government dramatically.	1
ClaimBuster	1182				But sooner or later that credit card mentality isn't going to work.	0
ClaimBuster	1183				My state just became the only state in the nation to provide for universal health care and we did it with the support of the business community and labor and the health care community and with virtually everybody in the state.	1
ClaimBuster	1184				American seniors have the highest life expectancy in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	1185				I'll get our incomes up.	0
ClaimBuster	1186				The man loves his wife and I appreciate that a lot.	0
ClaimBuster	1187				In the rest of the world, the countries and the businesses would be working together to make this transition in an intelligent way.	0
ClaimBuster	1188				And I saw a unique threat in Saddam Hussein, as did my opponent, because we thought he had weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	1189				People are stopped, and we have to do something about that.	0
ClaimBuster	1190				We have been discouraged and we've been alienated.	0
ClaimBuster	1191				We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.	0
ClaimBuster	1192				There's no question about that.	0
ClaimBuster	1193				Hiring people temporarily who have lost their jobs and they get to work for 30 days or 60 days.	1
ClaimBuster	1194				Let's go back to the tax and budget summit briefly.	0
ClaimBuster	1195				That's not bad for a guy that's never been there, right?	0
ClaimBuster	1196				And we're asking to be able to allow you to get them.	0
ClaimBuster	1197				The world -- let me tell you.	0
ClaimBuster	1198				If you can make 50 cents in the heart of Mexico, for example, or make $5 here in America, $5.15, you're going to come here if you're worth your salt, if you want to put food on the table for your families.	0
ClaimBuster	1199				It's obvious that there are certain things that have to be done and there are 50 or 60 different options, and a bipartisan commission to take it out of politics, will make recommendations and build support for the people.	0
ClaimBuster	1200				And there are two very different paths the country can take.	0
ClaimBuster	1201				And sadly, she doesn't have that.	0
ClaimBuster	1202				"I wrote a book about it several years ago -- six, seven years ago -- called ""The New War,"" which saw the difficulties of this international criminal network."	1
ClaimBuster	1203				I hope they're not awful things.	0
ClaimBuster	1204				She's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	1205				Now, when we look at these programs, might I suggest that in evaluating them we often have a tendency to say that the test of a program is how much you're spending.	0
ClaimBuster	1206				And then Senator Dole's ardent supporters, Senator McCain, who's out there today, along with Senator Feingold, supported, sponsored a campaign finance reform proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	1207				I was able to do that in my state and bring these two together.	0
ClaimBuster	1208				And so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college.	0
ClaimBuster	1209				That's creating tens of thousands of jobs all across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	1210				That's what President Clinton did.	1
ClaimBuster	1211				In the meantime, though, we're not going to let up the pressure until we have clear evidence that that takes place.	0
ClaimBuster	1212				It's now four years later.	1
ClaimBuster	1213				Should I be fortunate enough to become your president, when I put my hand on the Bible, I will swear to not only uphold the laws of the land, but I will also swear to uphold the honor and the dignity of the office to which I have been elected, so help me God.	0
ClaimBuster	1214				In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it.	1
ClaimBuster	1215				There's other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	1216				On Social Security he's not.	0
ClaimBuster	1217				That wasn't going to work.	0
ClaimBuster	1218				I said I'm opposed to discrimination.	1
ClaimBuster	1219				And it's not the fact -- it's not the fact that Senator Obama chooses to associate with a guy who in 2001 said that he wished he had have bombed more, and he had a long association with him.	1
ClaimBuster	1220				And people are willing to invest capital in the brown fields don't want to do so for fear of lawsuit.	0
ClaimBuster	1221				And that's why we're doing what he suggested we do: Get the Brits, the Germans and the French to go make it very clear to the Iranians that if they expect to be a party to the world to give up their nuclear ambitions.	0
ClaimBuster	1222				I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do.	0
ClaimBuster	1223				This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election.	0
ClaimBuster	1224				That's why I think I'll win.	0
ClaimBuster	1225				And everything in there says what I am for.	0
ClaimBuster	1226				My opponent says he hadn't changed his position on it.	1
ClaimBuster	1227				That's what you like, you've got a perfect candidate.	0
ClaimBuster	1228				It is true over 10 years ago I voted to delay production of the F - 14, and I'll tell you why.	1
ClaimBuster	1229				But the bottom line is, we are the strongest nation in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	1230				He had two terms in the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	1231				And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election.	0
ClaimBuster	1232				We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before -- 2,300,000 more are receiving them -- even though we took 850,000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them.	1
ClaimBuster	1233				President Bush has taken -- he's the only president in history to do this.	1
ClaimBuster	1234				But, unlike Governor Reagan, I do not support a boondoggle like the MX missile.	1
ClaimBuster	1235				Why did our government do it?	0
ClaimBuster	1236				But the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we're going to get the middle class back on track.	0
ClaimBuster	1237				If you're getting interest from a bank, if you're getting a statement from a mutual fund or any other kind of investment you have, you don't have to worry about filing taxes on that, because there'll be no taxes for anybody making $200,000.00 per year and less, on your interest, dividends and capital gains.	1
ClaimBuster	1238				It's my - my opinion that the private sector, where five out of six jobs are, where you have permanent jobs, with the opportunity for advancement, is a better place than make-work jobs under the program recommended by the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	1239				Now, that's a fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	1240				I've done the same thing in the appointment of women, and also Spanish-speaking Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	1241				And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that.	1
ClaimBuster	1242				I want to get a better rate of return for your own money than the paltry 2% that the current Social Security Trust gets today.	0
ClaimBuster	1243				I think that in this 21st century we will soon see the consequences of what's called global warming.	0
ClaimBuster	1244				Personal income has dropped while people have worked harder.	1
ClaimBuster	1245				He is the chairman of the health committee.	1
ClaimBuster	1246				And right now, the commanders in Afghanistan, as well as Admiral Mullen, have acknowledged that we don't have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge.	1
ClaimBuster	1247				We can get this economy going again.	0
ClaimBuster	1248				And then I would like to appoint people who would be interested in helping with that.	0
ClaimBuster	1249				If you're a Medicare person, on Medicare, you don't get the new procedures.	1
ClaimBuster	1250				Rayburn says, yeah, and that guy never ran for sheriff either.	1
ClaimBuster	1251				Those are initiatives in foreign policy which are of the highest moral standard and that is indicative of the foreign policy of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	1252				His own analysis says that unemployment will be slightly higher in 1995 under his plan than it is today.	1
ClaimBuster	1253				First of all, most of good governance is at the state level.	0
ClaimBuster	1254				The Russians can't believe it.	0
ClaimBuster	1255				We've got a 30 percent or 40 percent unemployment rate among minority uh - young people.	1
ClaimBuster	1256				And in some cases may be still at large.	0
ClaimBuster	1257				The minute we have bilateral talks, the six-party talks will unwind.	0
ClaimBuster	1258				Twenty percent of the upper-income people pay about 80 percent of the taxes in America today because of how we structured the tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	1259				Energy is going to be key in dealing with Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	1260				We have cut inflation by better than half.	1
ClaimBuster	1261				I've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago.	1
ClaimBuster	1262				That was in an ad, Jim, that was knocked down by the journalists who analyzed the ad and said it was misleading.	1
ClaimBuster	1263				I look forward to discussing it more with him, as time goes on.	1
ClaimBuster	1264				If we got along well, that would be good.	0
ClaimBuster	1265				The president -- and this is one of the reasons why I am very proud in this race to have the support of General John Shalikashvili, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Admiral William Crowe, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; General Tony McPeak, who ran the air war for the president's father and did a brilliant job, supporting me; General Wes Clark, who won the war in Kosovo, supporting me; because they all -- and General Baca, who was the head of the National Guard, supporting me.	1
ClaimBuster	1266				I don't dislike trial lawyers.	0
ClaimBuster	1267				The president broke the pay-as-you-go rule.	1
ClaimBuster	1268				It had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies, I mean, billions of dollars worth.	1
ClaimBuster	1269				The Soviets try to spy on us, steal this stuff.	1
ClaimBuster	1270				As the economy improves, and it is improving, our gross national product this year will average about 6 percent increase over last year.	1
ClaimBuster	1271				Right under the Soviet gun, with Soviet troops there, he is in a very difficult position in taking anything independent, a position which would be independent of the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	1272				Obviously, we've got an immediate crisis right now.	0
ClaimBuster	1273				That happened long before I arrived in Washington, D.C.	1
ClaimBuster	1274				We just had a pretty serious dispute with China because they were copying our CDs, and costing thousands of jobs in places like California.	1
ClaimBuster	1275				Many of her friends took bigger deductions.	1
ClaimBuster	1276				We can have health care for all Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	1277				Now, to suggest that because two Republican presidents tried to pass the SALT treaty - that puts them on its side - I would like to say that President Ford, who was within 90% of a treaty that we could be in agreement with when he left office, is emphatically against this SALT treaty.	1
ClaimBuster	1278				So I don't want anybody out there to think we've just been voting no, no, no.	0
ClaimBuster	1279				Well, I might say that I think the League of Conservation Voters is absolutely right.	0
ClaimBuster	1280				This is a great country.	0
ClaimBuster	1281				The best way to take the pressure off our troops is to succeed in Iraq, is to train Iraqis so they can do the hard work of democracy, is to give them a chance to defend their country, which is precisely what we're doing.	1
ClaimBuster	1282				You can't be on one hand this way and one hand another.	0
ClaimBuster	1283				There's a -- no, look, there's a systemic problem.	0
ClaimBuster	1284				But the big argument I have with the governor on this is this taking different positions on different issues -- trying to be one thing to one person here that's opposing the NAFTA agreement and then for it -- what we call waffling.	1
ClaimBuster	1285				And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.	0
ClaimBuster	1286				... the money -- the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses -- the money that you're talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets.	1
ClaimBuster	1287				He went down and made a speech to people who were on his side saying that I did the wrong thing.	1
ClaimBuster	1288				In terms of negative campaigning, you know, I don't want to sound like a kid in the schoolyard: he started it.	0
ClaimBuster	1289				And I will stand up for that right.	0
ClaimBuster	1290				Let me say what I've said already about this pardon issue.	0
ClaimBuster	1291				And as the percentage of the population is increasing nationally, somehow the allegation that we don't care and we're going to give money for this interest or that interest and not for children in the State of Texas is totally absurd.	1
ClaimBuster	1292				We passed a bill in 1992 that encouraged the states to adopt programs to stop kids from smoking.	1
ClaimBuster	1293				So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is.	0
ClaimBuster	1294				And that's why I have consistently said that, if we can work more effectively with other countries diplomatically to tighten sanctions on Iran, if we can reduce our energy consumption through alternative energy, so that Iran has less money, if we can impose the kinds of sanctions that, say, for example, Iran right now imports gasoline, even though it's an oil-producer, because its oil infrastructure has broken down, if we can prevent them from importing the gasoline that they need and the refined petroleum products, that starts changing their cost-benefit analysis.	1
ClaimBuster	1295				With the United States, as he said, not so much.	1
ClaimBuster	1296				Too often in appraising whether we are moving ahead or not we think only of what the federal government is doing.	0
ClaimBuster	1297				I believe that it is important to tell the truth to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	1298				We drove our schools to be number one in the nation.	0
ClaimBuster	1299				Those words mean something to me, as somebody who has been in combat.	0
ClaimBuster	1300				Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets.	1
ClaimBuster	1301				And I do think that you can't turn the White House into the Waffle House.	0
ClaimBuster	1302				I've voted eight, ten times since 1965.	1
ClaimBuster	1303				The Strunk family in Allentown, Pennsylvania, I campaigned with them the other day.	1
ClaimBuster	1304				I didn't favor it when it was in, started.	0
ClaimBuster	1305				Well, the program that he's proposing is not the one that he just described.	1
ClaimBuster	1306				And you must ask yourself, do you know enough about the candidates?	0
ClaimBuster	1307				We live-we bring everybody along.	0
ClaimBuster	1308				I would say, too, that when Senator Kennedy refers to the action of the House Rules Committee, there are eight Democrats on that committee and four Republicans.	1
ClaimBuster	1309				Here's the problem -- that for about 20 million people, you may find yourselves no longer having employer-based health insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	1310				But we have an opportunity -- we have an opportunity to use our research and development capacities, the great technology of the United States, to make our military lighter, harder to find, more lethal.	1
ClaimBuster	1311				As regarding Mr. Perot, I take back something I said about him.	0
ClaimBuster	1312				Well, it is an open discussion.	0
ClaimBuster	1313				We've done about all, we are the reform party, the Republican Party.	0
ClaimBuster	1314				The governors -- and I believe Governor Clinton was in on this -- but maybe -- I don't want to invoke him here.	0
ClaimBuster	1315				But, as Senator Kennedy said in January of this year in this same press conference, the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction, which means that all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers' salaries.	1
ClaimBuster	1316				Libya understood that America and others will enforce doctrine and that the world is better for it.	0
ClaimBuster	1317				We have to help these nations create civil societies.	0
ClaimBuster	1318				You can't hire a lobbyist uh out of unemployment compensation checks.	0
ClaimBuster	1319				It permits us to make sure that the projects which are invested in are going to produce greater wealth.	0
ClaimBuster	1320				I think we have an obligation to spend that kind of money.	0
ClaimBuster	1321				Secondly, Syria is an opportunity for us because Syria plays an important role in the Middle East, particularly right now.	0
ClaimBuster	1322				... or at an airport near you.	0
ClaimBuster	1323				We're the only two lawyers in Washington that trust each other.	0
ClaimBuster	1324				That's why I'm running for president, and that's what I hope we're going to be talking about tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	1325				Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands -- excuse me.	0
ClaimBuster	1326				It was killed in the Rules Committee.	1
ClaimBuster	1327				In fact, Mr. Ayers has become the centerpiece of Senator McCain's campaign over the last two or three weeks.	0
ClaimBuster	1328				And the president should lead a national effort to change behavior, to keep our children alive in the schools, responsible behavior to keep people alive.	0
ClaimBuster	1329				In the first place, they made a fatal error in misjudging the Communists; in trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world.	0
ClaimBuster	1330				I got some of the details wrong last week in some of the examples that I used, Jim, and I'm sorry about that.	1
ClaimBuster	1331				Now, that transition has to take place in a responsible fashion.	0
ClaimBuster	1332				But he has a responsibility to be accurate, and not to misstate the case.	0
ClaimBuster	1333				I happened to believe strong accountability encourages parental involvement, though.	0
ClaimBuster	1334				It's not the same as Simpson- Bowles.	0
ClaimBuster	1335				Thank you, and good night.	0
ClaimBuster	1336				As a matter of fact, it is the economic recovery program that we presented when I took office in 1981.	1
ClaimBuster	1337				Every middle class family is eligible for a tax cut under my proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	1338				I wish I knew the law that said all of us would be good parents.	0
ClaimBuster	1339				And that was unpopular, but it was the right thing to do.	0
ClaimBuster	1340				I went to Washington to solve problems.	1
ClaimBuster	1341				And to suggest -- am I incorrect in that regard, on Sunday, the -- your secretary --	0
ClaimBuster	1342				We created a 10 percent bracket to help lower-income Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	1343				And General Petraeus says we have had great success, but it's very fragile.	1
ClaimBuster	1344				For me, I look at what's happened in the last four years and say this has been a disappointment.	0
ClaimBuster	1345				And we are now looking at a deficit of well over half a trillion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	1346				I don√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢t think he will because under his plan if you work out the numbers √É‚Äö $100 billion comes out of Medicare just for the wealthiest 1% in the tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	1347				And one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates and women are getting the same fair deal as men are.	0
ClaimBuster	1348				Spending was only up something like 4 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	1349				And now we hear a lot of talk, oh, well, we all want enterprise zones, and yet the House and the Senate can't send it down without loading it up with a lot of, you know, these Christmas tree ornaments they put on the legislation.	0
ClaimBuster	1350				I want to come back and tell you why, but if you will forgive me, I would like to say something right now at the beginning of this debate following on the moment of silence for Mel Carnahan and Randy Carnahan and Chris Sifford.	0
ClaimBuster	1351				"But in return for extra spending, we now want people to measure -- states and local jurisdictions to measure to show us whether or not a child can read or write or add and subtract. """	0
ClaimBuster	1352				It's almost you remember that expression, get the lead out?	0
ClaimBuster	1353				They can't live in the community which they grew up in.	0
ClaimBuster	1354				So, I don't want to fool around with it.	0
ClaimBuster	1355				"About another woman, he said, ""That wouldn't be my first choice."""	1
ClaimBuster	1356				Let me say at the outset, uh - I'm very proud of the record of this administration.	0
ClaimBuster	1357				I didn't think I'd say this, but I'm going to say it, and I hate to say it.	0
ClaimBuster	1358				She's telling us how to fight ISIS.	1
ClaimBuster	1359				That's working with other nations.	0
ClaimBuster	1360				The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can't believe they allowed us to do this.	1
ClaimBuster	1361				There's just a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	1362				And we're more respected because of the way we have conducted ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	1363				We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	1364				I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?	0
ClaimBuster	1365				If you do, you invite the taking of more hostages.	0
ClaimBuster	1366				I have a plan to cover those folks.	1
ClaimBuster	1367				A capital gains differential will increase jobs, increase risk taking, increase revenues to the Federal Government.	0
ClaimBuster	1368				And so what I want is a -- is a comprehensive strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	1369				And so let's kind of stay on the issue, and I have made a specific proposal for what I call a flexible freeze.	0
ClaimBuster	1370				Now, what he says is he's going to make sure that this doesn't add to the deficit and he's going to cut middleclass taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	1371				Because part of Russia's intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where President Saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that Putin favored more.	1
ClaimBuster	1372				Well, I would repeal and replace it.	0
ClaimBuster	1373				Now, what happens is when you begin to get people covered like that -- for instance in diabetes, if you diagnose diabetes early, you could save $50 billion in the health care system of America by avoiding surgery and dialysis.	1
ClaimBuster	1374				Those things will get us the energy we need.	0
ClaimBuster	1375				It was the largest expansion of private insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	1376				This is something I take seriously and that's my position.	0
ClaimBuster	1377				I've worked on these things for 12 years and I'm the only person up here who hasn't been part of Washington in any way for the last 20 years.	1
ClaimBuster	1378				I think that conservation - I think that a change in lifestyles - is necessary, and we had better begin to plan for that now rather than later.	0
ClaimBuster	1379				I hope some day it will rise; but I don't think it will rise if we continue the same policies toward Cuba that we did in recent years, and in fact towards all of Latin America - when we've almost ignored the needs of Latin America; we've beamed not a single Voice of America program in Spanish to all of Latin America in the last eight years, except for the three months of the Hungarian uh - revolution.	1
ClaimBuster	1380				And if you can't, there will be a federal consequence.	0
ClaimBuster	1381				We ought to move forward swiftly on my ideas of ethanol which would use more corn, and therefore, create a bigger market for our agricultural products.	1
ClaimBuster	1382				The American people had lost faith and trust and confidence in the presidency itself.	0
ClaimBuster	1383				Georgie Anne, we, believe me, supported the Simpson-Mazzoli bill strongly -- and the bill that came out of the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	1384				We've been drifting too long.	0
ClaimBuster	1385				And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them.	1
ClaimBuster	1386				I would like to have a crusade today, and I would like to lead that crusade with your help.	0
ClaimBuster	1387				And since then, for years, I have lived with the burden of the Middle East, where it's eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth country, in terms of their unhappiness with the fact that I was successful in that effort.	1
ClaimBuster	1388				If I make a mistake, I admit it.	0
ClaimBuster	1389				I'm against quotas, they're illegal.	0
ClaimBuster	1390				We're working hard to sign up children.	0
ClaimBuster	1391				And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet...	1
ClaimBuster	1392				But the enemy attacked us, Jim, and I have a solemn duty to protect the American people, to do everything I can to protect us.	1
ClaimBuster	1393				And some major uh - uh - manufacturing companies, like Dow Chemical, have through uh - very effective efficiency mechanism cut down the use of energy by uh - as much as 40 percent with the same out-product.	1
ClaimBuster	1394				Prior to Darfur, Ambassador Jack Danforth had been negotiating a north-south agreement that we would have hoped would have brought peace to the Sudan.	1
ClaimBuster	1395				Now, it wasn't just on Wall Street.	0
ClaimBuster	1396				But time is our friend there, because their leaders will change in not too many years, worst case, and their country is making great progress.	0
ClaimBuster	1397				We're down to 336 ships.	1
ClaimBuster	1398				People from both political parties came together in the halls of Congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice.	1
ClaimBuster	1399				Now that's an issue between Mr. Nixon and myself.	0
ClaimBuster	1400				We got to cut it out.	0
ClaimBuster	1401				We may differ about what the elements of that are.	0
ClaimBuster	1402				we're confronted with the horrendous problems that we've discussed here tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	1403				I've also learned that there are no simple answers to complicated questions.	0
ClaimBuster	1404				And that's what the No Child Left Behind Act does.	0
ClaimBuster	1405				If we're going to ask young men and young women to protect us and defend us around the world, and we've had more deployments under this administration than any time in history.	0
ClaimBuster	1406				It seemed to me the violence stopped when these leaders came to America.	0
ClaimBuster	1407				Well, let me just follow up, my friends.	0
ClaimBuster	1408				He called them coerced and the bribed.	1
ClaimBuster	1409				We're a country of laws.	0
ClaimBuster	1410				I know that the people you pick make an enormous difference in your ability to govern and I set high standards.	0
ClaimBuster	1411				So we got to be guarded in our generosity.	0
ClaimBuster	1412				They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul.	1
ClaimBuster	1413				But John is right we have to make cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	1414				That's the choice you'll have is having your employer no longer provide you health care.	0
ClaimBuster	1415				Show us if they are learning to read, write, add and subtract and if so there will be bonus plans.	0
ClaimBuster	1416				Let's be honest about it.	0
ClaimBuster	1417				In addition to that, the adversarial relationship between ourselves and the Soviet Union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly.	0
ClaimBuster	1418				But there are limits to what we can spend.	0
ClaimBuster	1419				America's going to come back, and for that to happen, we're going to have to have a president who can work across the aisle.	0
ClaimBuster	1420				Then I would really focus on let's get these things out.	0
ClaimBuster	1421				And that is very important.	0
ClaimBuster	1422				So I think our selection uh - of Bob Dole as vice president uh - is based on merit.	0
ClaimBuster	1423				That makes life a lot easier.	0
ClaimBuster	1424				We have for example a gross national product of approximately five hundred billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	1425				But no, I'm for the sanctity of life, and once that illegality is established, then we can come to grips with the penalty side, and of course there's got to be some penalties to enforce the law, whatever they may be.	0
ClaimBuster	1426				We've got to remain energy-independent.	0
ClaimBuster	1427				And then we have his own record, which is we have four consecutive years where he said when he was running for office, he would cut the deficit in half.	1
ClaimBuster	1428				We hammerlock the American companies -- American Airlines, Delta -- the last few great we have, because we're trying to do this deal with these 2 European companies.	1
ClaimBuster	1429				There's no way for our people now to understand what their government is.	0
ClaimBuster	1430				Well, Republicans and Democrats came together on a bipartisan basis to put in place education principles that focused on having great teachers in the classroom.	1
ClaimBuster	1431				I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it.	0
ClaimBuster	1432				Is our relative strength growing?	0
ClaimBuster	1433				And this is not personal -- there are deep differences about our future, and that's the basis of my campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	1434				I I think that, technically, I know this is a difficult and an emotional problem, and many people sincerely feel on both sides of this, but I do believe that maybe we could find the answer through medical evidence, if we would determine once and for all, is an unborn child a human being?	0
ClaimBuster	1435				If we're not training engineers to make sure that they are equipped here in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	1436				And as a matter of fact, I think for most people the notion of President Quayle is a very very troubling thought.	0
ClaimBuster	1437				The trial lawyers, of course they like lawsuits, so every time they have a bill that they want vetoed, the president vetoes it for them.	1
ClaimBuster	1438				Because if they succeed, I believe the country succeeds.	0
ClaimBuster	1439				This is a leadership role that the United States under this administration is carrying out, and if we do it, and I think the opportunities and the possibilities are getting better, we will have solved many of the internal domestic problems that exist in South Korea at the present time.	0
ClaimBuster	1440				But we have to have a government that is responsive to the Afghan people, and, frankly, it's just not responsive right now.	0
ClaimBuster	1441				"The ""we"" is you and me."	0
ClaimBuster	1442				I think tax policy is a major difference between Senator McCain and myself.	0
ClaimBuster	1443				I will not cut benefits.	0
ClaimBuster	1444				So, under the circumstances, what do we do?	0
ClaimBuster	1445				Terrorists can now come into America and go to a gun show and, without even a background check, buy an assault weapon today.	1
ClaimBuster	1446				You do a lot of things nobody knows about.	0
ClaimBuster	1447				We don't want to get drawn into a military conflict.	0
ClaimBuster	1448				And one last thing -- just -- just to make this point.	0
ClaimBuster	1449				In all due respect, I'm not so sure it's credible to quote leading news organizations about -- oh, never mind.	0
ClaimBuster	1450				I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there.	0
ClaimBuster	1451				And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up -- it's true -- but they've gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years.	1
ClaimBuster	1452				This is a political year, and the President is playing politics with Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	1453				He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.	1
ClaimBuster	1454				Can you say that a little louder, Candy?	0
ClaimBuster	1455				We have to work with Nigeria.	0
ClaimBuster	1456				"He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: ""You complain, I'll get you deported."""	1
ClaimBuster	1457				You have to tell me one time when you have stood up with the leaders of your party on one single major issue.	0
ClaimBuster	1458				But it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.	1
ClaimBuster	1459				Well, the White House is a bully pulpit, and I think we ought to be pounding on the table every day.	0
ClaimBuster	1460				We just can't afford four more years like the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	1461				I sent up my budget man to the Congress, and he says, here's how we're going to reduce the deficit in half by five years.	1
ClaimBuster	1462				All I said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements, because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places.	1
ClaimBuster	1463				Now, we may not succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	1464				Our tax structure is a disgrace, it needs to be reformed.	0
ClaimBuster	1465				Now that the voices in the Congress and throughout the country have insisted that we do something about China, look at what has happened.	0
ClaimBuster	1466				Well, when it comes to ridicule, George, you win a gold medal.	0
ClaimBuster	1467				But let's get at the bottom line.	0
ClaimBuster	1468				And I make it plain again: I am for women's rights.	0
ClaimBuster	1469				--notwithstanding my opponent's ad, my plan triggers in at gross incomes, family incomes of $200,000 and above.	1
ClaimBuster	1470				We are not at war with Islam.	1
ClaimBuster	1471				I hope not in both cases.	0
ClaimBuster	1472				And -- and I -- I think the president just said correctly that the buck does stop at his desk and -- and he takes responsibility for -- for that -- for the failure in providing those security resources, and -- and those terrible things may well happen from time to time.	0
ClaimBuster	1473				And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas.	1
ClaimBuster	1474				I would like to know from the governor -- I know we're not supposed to ask each other questions -- but I'd be interested in knowing, does that trillion dollars come from the trust fund, or does it come from the rest of the budget?	0
ClaimBuster	1475				And I think that there's a general agreement in many parts of the world now that there ought to be changes in the IMF.	0
ClaimBuster	1476				And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don't even know if it's accurate information, and then they put it out.	1
ClaimBuster	1477				I think that part of it is the crime infested neighborhoods, and that's why I'm a strong believer in trying to control crimes in the neighborhood, why I was so pleased to be endorsed by the policemen on the beat, the Boston Police Department the other day.	1
ClaimBuster	1478				That will change when I'm president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	1479				I think the President genuinely believes that they're better off.	0
ClaimBuster	1480				"With regard to Social Security, I hope there'll be more time than just this minute to mention that, but I will say this: A President should never say ""never.''"	0
ClaimBuster	1481				I hope over the next ten years you will see a big increase over the percentage of people that have pension plans, plus a secure Social Security system.	0
ClaimBuster	1482				And that really is going to be a challenge for the next president of the United States; I don't think there's any question about it.	0
ClaimBuster	1483				So I tried diplomacy, went to the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	1484				We need to do better in job retraining.	0
ClaimBuster	1485				And the president and I have a difference of opinion about how we live out our sense of our faith.	0
ClaimBuster	1486				I've had to make thousands of decisions, and each one of those decisions has been a learning process.	1
ClaimBuster	1487				And my program is this.	0
ClaimBuster	1488				I believe the president of the United States should indicate it.	0
ClaimBuster	1489				Because the tax code is unfair for people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.	0
ClaimBuster	1490				The question is: are we moving in the direction of peace and security?	0
ClaimBuster	1491				Some of them are in public life in the Senate, the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	1492				That's not the right course for America.	0
ClaimBuster	1493				For instance, we're flying unmanned vehicles that can send real- time messages back to stations in the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	1494				And I've put forward a plan to make sure that we're bringing manufacturing jobs back to our shores by rewarding companies and small businesses that are investing here, not overseas.	1
ClaimBuster	1495				Forty-one percent of those 10 million are women.	1
ClaimBuster	1496				He can talk about Iran/Contra and also-I'll make a deal with you, I will take the blame for those two incidents if you give me half the credit for all the good things that have happened in world peace since Ronald Reagan and I took over from the Carter administration.	0
ClaimBuster	1497				And if you have some of each -- and I have some age, some experience and some intelligence -- that adds up to wisdom.	0
ClaimBuster	1498				We're trying to solve it.	0
ClaimBuster	1499				You just don't make unilateral cuts in the naive hope that the Soviets are going to behave themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	1500				Pardon means that what you did, whether it's right or wrong, you're forgiven for it.	1
ClaimBuster	1501				So that is not the way our democracy works.	0
ClaimBuster	1502				But the best thing to do is to reform Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	1503				The American people don't know what those commitments are.	0
ClaimBuster	1504				These things are paid for in the balanced budget plan.	1
ClaimBuster	1505				That's why we say mutual and verifiable freezes.	0
ClaimBuster	1506				Was it the right thing to do?	0
ClaimBuster	1507				It might be an oil fire, it might be a jet exhaust, the computer might decide it's a missile -- and off we go.	0
ClaimBuster	1508				Second, he's wrong in the analogies that he makes.	0
ClaimBuster	1509				I think that this farm policy has failed.	0
ClaimBuster	1510				I think it is disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in Social Security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness, and they are receiving disability checks from Social Security every month while a state institution provides for all of their needs and their care.	1
ClaimBuster	1511				He was president for 3 years before he proposed a health care plan that still hasn't been sent to Congress in total; three years before an economic plan, and he still didn't say tonight that that tax bill he vetoed raised taxes only on the rich and gave the rest of you a break -- but he vetoed it anyway.	1
ClaimBuster	1512				And we work with those other countries.	0
ClaimBuster	1513				First thing I'm going to do is ask the Secretary of Defense to develop a plan so we are making sure we're not spending our money on political projects, but on projects to make sure our soldiers are well-paid, well-housed, and have the best equipment in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	1514				I think you put your finger on a major problem.	0
ClaimBuster	1515				But they're on line and they're waiting to become citizens.	1
ClaimBuster	1516				Well, it is a terribly painful situation for Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	1517				Well, Oliver, first, let me tell you what's in the rescue package for you.	0
ClaimBuster	1518				They must go hand in hand, but the security of this nation has got to come first.	0
ClaimBuster	1519				Now, results is what counts.	0
ClaimBuster	1520				Convention, the VFW National Convention - when I spoke to each of those bodies - I outlined a very specific program of increasing pay and allowances, reenlistment bonuses.	1
ClaimBuster	1521				We're going to have borders in our country, which we don't have now.	0
ClaimBuster	1522				And that's exactly what I have proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	1523				And we have two fundamentally different visions of America.	0
ClaimBuster	1524				This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party, as exemplified by the actions that I have taken in the Oval Office the last four years, as contrasted with Governor Reagan, who in most cases does typify his party, but in some cases, there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others.	0
ClaimBuster	1525				But we went in in the interest of peace and to keep Israel and Syria from getting into the sixth war between them.	1
ClaimBuster	1526				Imagine how many IRS agents it is going to take to be able to figure out his targeted tax cut for the middle class that excludes 50 million Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	1527				I don't favor a litmus test, but I know that there are ways to assess how a potential justice interprets the Constitution.	0
ClaimBuster	1528				And I am not apologetic at all about our record with women.	0
ClaimBuster	1529				But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped?	0
ClaimBuster	1530				Let's put it in terms that all of us can understand.	0
ClaimBuster	1531				Put those jobs in the inner cities instead of doing diplomatic deals and shipping them to China where prison labor does the work.	0
ClaimBuster	1532				OK, so it hasn't fallen.	0
ClaimBuster	1533				He could leave the parties in doubt as to which one he would use; and therefore there would be incentive, instead of as now - the steel companies were ready to take the strike because they felt the injunction of eighty days would break the union, which didn't happen.	1
ClaimBuster	1534				And I got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if there's anybody here who thinks there aren't agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	1535				As president of the United States, Alan, I would order the secretary of the treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in America and renegotiate at the new value of those homes -- at the diminished value of those homes and let people be able to make those -- be able to make those payments and stay in their homes.	0
ClaimBuster	1536				Senator Kennedy is in the hospital.	1
ClaimBuster	1537				So let's not be throwing stones about it.	0
ClaimBuster	1538				We're making really good progress.	0
ClaimBuster	1539				It requires pro-growth policies that grow our economy and fiscal sanity in the halls of Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	1540				But don't forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years' worth of breaks, into -- into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1.	1
ClaimBuster	1541				Now I understand it's been extended 'til some time next year.	1
ClaimBuster	1542				The farm payments are going down because the agricultural economy is coming back.	1
ClaimBuster	1543				Energy independence for North America in five years.	0
ClaimBuster	1544				Millions of jobs were lost, the auto industry was on the brink of collapse.	1
ClaimBuster	1545				He founded authored, the job training partnership act.	1
ClaimBuster	1546				Now that sounds to me a little bit different.	0
ClaimBuster	1547				But policies that give people a helping hand so they can help themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	1548				Look, now she's blaming -- she got caught in a total lie.	0
ClaimBuster	1549				And the only reason they did it is because she's running for the office of president and they want to look tough.	0
ClaimBuster	1550				That's not how America became the greatest country on the face of the earth.	0
ClaimBuster	1551				Within that sixty-billion dollars increase there would be fit the programs that I promised the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	1552				So I would be firm.	0
ClaimBuster	1553				And so please, go to...	0
ClaimBuster	1554				And then how about a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution?	0
ClaimBuster	1555				Is that a -- is that a separate topic?	0
ClaimBuster	1556				And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us.	0
ClaimBuster	1557				And the testimony under oath was to the effect that I did not talk to Mr. Nixon, to Mr. Haldeman, to Mr. Ehrlichman, or to any of the people at the White House.	1
ClaimBuster	1558				And we need to make sure they have the arms they need to carry out the very important role which is getting rid of Assad.	0
ClaimBuster	1559				I would say first of all that we must have in mind the fact that we have been negotiating to get tests inspected and uh - to get an agreement for many, many months.	1
ClaimBuster	1560				That was a give away and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works.	0
ClaimBuster	1561				And housing has begun to rise.	1
ClaimBuster	1562				They can't squeeze another desk in for her, so she has to stand during class.	0
ClaimBuster	1563				I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help.	0
ClaimBuster	1564				That's the kind of approach that will work.	0
ClaimBuster	1565				At the point when I could not get them to address those problems, I had created so much stress in the board, who wanted to just keep the Lawrence Welk music going, that they asked to buy my remaining shares.	1
ClaimBuster	1566				And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country.	1
ClaimBuster	1567				And there's nothing corny about having sports heroes, young people that are clean and honorable and out there setting the pace.	0
ClaimBuster	1568				I believe that discipline and respect for the law -- all of these things should be taught to children, not in our schools, but families have to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	1569				It's not just more troops.	0
ClaimBuster	1570				I -- I find it ironic that he's raising nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	1571				Now, you cite a study.	1
ClaimBuster	1572				Well, let me take him up on this question of farm subsidies.	0
ClaimBuster	1573				And then that number disappears for high-income people.	1
ClaimBuster	1574				[Laughter] I don't have a plan to tax -- or increase taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	1575				Now, just remember when you think about me -- I didn't create this mess.	0
ClaimBuster	1576				We will drill more oil and gas wells this year than any year in history.	0
ClaimBuster	1577				When I was governor of Massachusetts, to get a high school degree, you had to pass an exam.	1
ClaimBuster	1578				When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president.	1
ClaimBuster	1579				I don't think it's the issues that turn kids off.	0
ClaimBuster	1580				And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work.	0
ClaimBuster	1581				My balanced budget plan puts ten years on the Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	1582				We will do what we do best.	0
ClaimBuster	1583				He said in his first year he'd put out an immigration plan that would deal with our immigration challenges.	1
ClaimBuster	1584				Well, tonight we had the first debate over the deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	1585				He said the standard bearer wasn't for it.	1
ClaimBuster	1586				Let's, first of all, understand that the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system.	0
ClaimBuster	1587				It's critical to our future.	0
ClaimBuster	1588				He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like.	0
ClaimBuster	1589				We have to start to spend the money now.	0
ClaimBuster	1590				The year that he decided we had lost our way was the year that John F. Kennedy was running against Richard Nixon.	1
ClaimBuster	1591				But we aren't going to move America forward and we aren't going to be able to lead the world to win this struggle for freedom if we have a permanent inferiority complex about American achievements.	0
ClaimBuster	1592				How can we extend freedom - extend it without war?	0
ClaimBuster	1593				There has never been anything like this, where e-mails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.	1
ClaimBuster	1594				I hope that Senator Obama will repudiate those remarks that were made by Congressman John Lewis, very unfair and totally inappropriate.	0
ClaimBuster	1595				I guess I rely more on the individual.	0
ClaimBuster	1596				And I would cite again Dan Quayle.	0
ClaimBuster	1597				I've served this country for fourteen years in the Congress and before that in the service.	1
ClaimBuster	1598				I've laid out a plan by which I think we can be successful in Iraq: with a summit, by doing better training, faster, by cutting -- by doing what we need to do with respect to the U.N. and the elections.	1
ClaimBuster	1599				I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters.	0
ClaimBuster	1600				And the thought that we would share this with the Soviet Union is, in my opinion, a total non-STARTer.	0
ClaimBuster	1601				"""Those are the three words that she left me with."	1
ClaimBuster	1602				And that's one of the major issues in this uh - campaign of 1976.	0
ClaimBuster	1603				We have disagreed, I believe, on virtually every other issue.	0
ClaimBuster	1604				We have to -- it has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it.	0
ClaimBuster	1605				In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don't need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have.	0
ClaimBuster	1606				The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana, and I regret it.	1
ClaimBuster	1607				He said, we will look at offshore drilling.	1
ClaimBuster	1608				I think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively.	0
ClaimBuster	1609				The opportunities that the child will -- will be able to achieve increase dramatically.	0
ClaimBuster	1610				Uh - the Department of uh - uh - HUD is enforcing the new legislation that uhh - outlaws, that takes care of redlining.	1
ClaimBuster	1611				So hold the line on Social Security and put a cap on the growth of the mandatory program.	0
ClaimBuster	1612				We don't know -- there are no inspectors now in Iraq, the coalition that was in place isn't as strong as it used to be.	1
ClaimBuster	1613				It's clear for everybody to see.	0
ClaimBuster	1614				I've visited so many communities.	1
ClaimBuster	1615				Love your neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself.	0
ClaimBuster	1616				I send them there, oftentimes into harm's way.	1
ClaimBuster	1617				We couldn't get it done, because I wasn't enforceable.	0
ClaimBuster	1618				Mr. Nixon said that we should not regard them as pawns in the cold war; we should identify ourselves with them.	1
ClaimBuster	1619				Do you want to give me some suggestions?	0
ClaimBuster	1620				I want to thank the League of Women Voters, the good citizens of Kansas City, and President Reagan for agreeing to debate this evening.	0
ClaimBuster	1621				High-income people are doing just fine in this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	1622				Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.	1
ClaimBuster	1623				But the president has underfunded it by $28 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	1624				Going to be more deaths that they thought.	0
ClaimBuster	1625				I think by acting firmly and decisively, it will mean it is less likely we have to use force.	0
ClaimBuster	1626				I'm sure you're aware, Senator Obama, of the program in the Washington, D.C., school system where vouchers are provided and there's a certain number, I think it's a thousand and some and some 9,000 parents asked to be eligible for that.	1
ClaimBuster	1627				Jim, the president just said something extraordinarily revealing and frankly very important in this debate.	0
ClaimBuster	1628				Four of them here tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	1629				One of the largest industries in the world is the travel and tourist business.	1
ClaimBuster	1630				She's got experience, but it's bad experience.	0
ClaimBuster	1631				Secondly, allow small businesses to pool together so they can share risk and buy insurance at the same discounts big businesses get to do.	0
ClaimBuster	1632				But history will look back, and I'm fully prepared to accept any mistakes that history judges to my administration, because the president makes the decisions, the president has to take the responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	1633				Of course we see in Syria, 30,000 civilians having been killed by the military there.	1
ClaimBuster	1634				What's happening in the Middle East, there are developments around the world that are of real concern.	0
ClaimBuster	1635				The world is more dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	1636				I believe that's the answer.	0
ClaimBuster	1637				Because you are the ones who have the hardest time paying taxes, the hardest time making ends meet.	0
ClaimBuster	1638				We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.	0
ClaimBuster	1639				What Senator McCain doesn't mention is he's been there 26 of them.	1
ClaimBuster	1640				"He keeps talking about, ""Let the inspectors do their job."""	0
ClaimBuster	1641				I wish we could spend an hour talking about trusting people.	0
ClaimBuster	1642				Yes, we have a $263 billion deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	1643				Everybody knows that including the people at the Pentagon.	0
ClaimBuster	1644				And I want to talk about my plan some more -- I hope we can.	0
ClaimBuster	1645				Of course we've got to do preparations, starting with low-level diplomatic talks, and it may not work, because Iran is a rogue regime.	0
ClaimBuster	1646				I agree that the surplus is the American people's money, it's your money.	0
ClaimBuster	1647				The president has a great responsibility.	1
ClaimBuster	1648				Those are the people, Democrats and Republicans, who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	1649				We'll be on again Saturday night, 8 to 9 o'clock on ABC.	1
ClaimBuster	1650				The United States has to be strong in order to make sure that we can help promote peace and security and stability.	0
ClaimBuster	1651				Having a tax code that rewards companies that are shipping jobs overseas instead of companies that are investing here in the United States, that will not make us more competitive.	0
ClaimBuster	1652				And so I just have a different approach.	0
ClaimBuster	1653				I have seen Communist influence and Castro influence rise in Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	1654				We're not able to consume what we're able to produce at a time when the Soviet Union is making great economic gains.	1
ClaimBuster	1655				And we admire your pluck and perseverance.	0
ClaimBuster	1656				And we've focused on the tactical.	0
ClaimBuster	1657				That had nothing to do with the other thing of talking about their needs or anything.	0
ClaimBuster	1658				So both those extremes grasp for advantage and the person who has to pay that expense is the middle-income family who's still working for a living and they have to pay for the rich who have privilege, and for the poor who are not working.	0
ClaimBuster	1659				Mr. Corddry, it's a shame now that there are only two of us here debating, because the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement on this particular issue, and the only one who would be disagreeing with us is the President, if he were present.	0
ClaimBuster	1660				I think that's about a realistic timeframe.	0
ClaimBuster	1661				My friends, do we need to spend that kind of money?	0
ClaimBuster	1662				And therefore on this question I don't think that there is any doubt in the mind of any American; I hope there is not any doubt in the mind of any member of the community of West Berlin; I'm sure there isn't any doubt in the mind of the Russians.	0
ClaimBuster	1663				All have to do is agree to refurbish it, make it habitable, and live in it - just as 100 or more years ago, we did with the open land in this country - urban .	0
ClaimBuster	1664				They put up the American flag.	0
ClaimBuster	1665				Now we have to succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	1666				Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago, there's an awful lot of violence and they're not using AK-47s.	1
ClaimBuster	1667				Mr. Putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries and/or entities invest capital, there's a reasonable rate of return, a way to get the money out of the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	1668				We have made so many bad deals during the last -- so she's got experience, that I agree.	0
ClaimBuster	1669				Yes, I think that that's a very good question, because I've heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	1670				There are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me.	1
ClaimBuster	1671				Doing better in the neighborhoods.	0
ClaimBuster	1672				We're headed down to the low 200s if we go through a sequestration.	0
ClaimBuster	1673				I know what it's like to see somebody you love nearly lose their lives, and I hate drugs, Senator.	0
ClaimBuster	1674				So it's adding to cost.	1
ClaimBuster	1675				Parents are going to have to show more responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	1676				I've got a plan on Medicare, for example, that's a two-stage plan that says we'll have immediate help for seniors and what I call immediate Helping Hand, a $48 billion program.	1
ClaimBuster	1677				I think we have to invest in education, protecting the environment, health care, a prescription drug benefit that goes to all seniors, not just to the poor, under Medicare, not relying on HMOs and insurance companies.	0
ClaimBuster	1678				He got a notice or he didn't.	0
ClaimBuster	1679				I think the woman that works with me, Rose Zamaria, is about as tough as a boot out there and makes some discipline and protects the taxpayer.	0
ClaimBuster	1680				I'm pleased that I've balanced budgets.	1
ClaimBuster	1681				There's no -- and we have to do them all at once.	0
ClaimBuster	1682				We've got home ownership at a 15-year high.	1
ClaimBuster	1683				Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system.	1
ClaimBuster	1684				You are familiar, of course, with the fact that I am the first president in thirty years who has reorganized the intelligence agencies in the federal government: the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the others.	1
ClaimBuster	1685				He doesn't want U.S. leadership, however, to send mixed signals, to not stand with the Iraqi people.	0
ClaimBuster	1686				We're going to block grant into the states.	0
ClaimBuster	1687				That's not a grand coalition.	0
ClaimBuster	1688				And yet Mr. Bush tried to cut their cost of living increase in 1985.	1
ClaimBuster	1689				We're still down 580,000 jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	1690				Brady Bill, I agree that it's a timid step in the right direction but it won't fix it.	0
ClaimBuster	1691				There have been some tough cases come across my desk.	0
ClaimBuster	1692				Well, it's not a matter of uh - Republican and Democrat.	0
ClaimBuster	1693				I think my dad would be pretty proud of me, because I think we've come a long long way and I think, you know three months ago, I remember some of the great publications in this country had written me off.	0
ClaimBuster	1694				Now, for four years that's what I worked on.	1
ClaimBuster	1695				Well, no, it's no answer to those 37 million people, most of them members of working families who don't have a dime of health insurance and don't know how to pay the bills if their kids get sick at night.	1
ClaimBuster	1696				One of the reasons we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have a gun or not.	0
ClaimBuster	1697				We're going to let everybody buy into the same health-care plan senators and congressmen give themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	1698				Our challenge is to stop the financial bleeding.	0
ClaimBuster	1699				This is the way we're going to create jobs in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	1700				It encourages the use of renewables like ethanol and biodiesel.	0
ClaimBuster	1701				We'll put in place the kind of principles that I put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured and we'll focus on getting the cost of health care down.	0
ClaimBuster	1702				And, as a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history took place 1977.	1
ClaimBuster	1703				If I'm president, I'll double them, and also get the -- the oil from offshore and Alaska.	0
ClaimBuster	1704				But we are putting our energy companies out of business.	1
ClaimBuster	1705				And I came to the conclusion that our love was strong enough to be able to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	1706				This is an issue they've brought up.	1
ClaimBuster	1707				Medicare is paid for by the American taxpayer.	1
ClaimBuster	1708				They just write a note for the interest.	0
ClaimBuster	1709				We have, with our five-year plan for the leasing of offshore lands, proposed more land to be drilled than has been opened up for drilling since this program first started in 1954.	1
ClaimBuster	1710				And so part of the problem, I think, for a lot of people who are listening here tonight is they don't feel as if they are sharing the burden with other folks.	0
ClaimBuster	1711				And we ought to expand our markets abroad.	0
ClaimBuster	1712				Well, first, let me say there you go again, Mr. President, talking about a Medicare cut.	0
ClaimBuster	1713				We have a big program in my state that teaches mothers or fathers to teach their kids to get ready for school.	1
ClaimBuster	1714				We've got to treat it as international crime.	0
ClaimBuster	1715				And his own uh - Office of Management and Budget testified that he had a $3 billion cut insurance added to the defense budget - defense budget under the pressure from the Pentagon.	1
ClaimBuster	1716				Nuclear is the single greatest threat.	0
ClaimBuster	1717				Well, that just isn't true.	0
ClaimBuster	1718				But it's going to take some study and some work, and not just passing a tax increase to let the load - or the roof - fall in on the next administration.	0
ClaimBuster	1719				That's part of my health care plan.	1
ClaimBuster	1720				Let me just say, Bob.	0
ClaimBuster	1721				We've opened 260,000 new jobs in the military to women since I've been president.	1
ClaimBuster	1722				That doesn't restrict people's freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	1723				Now, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, and you will then fall into the category where you'll have to pay a fine if you don't provide health insurance that Senator Obama mandates, not the kind that you think is best for your family, your children, your employees, but the kind that he mandates for you.	1
ClaimBuster	1724				I met a man who spent eight months in prison, wasn't even allowed to call his lawyer, wasn't allowed to get -- finally, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois intervened and was able to get him out.	1
ClaimBuster	1725				A lot remains to be done.	0
ClaimBuster	1726				I'm happy to do that, too.	0
ClaimBuster	1727				I think that in ten years, we can reduce our dependence so that we no longer have to import oil from the Middle East or Venezuela.	0
ClaimBuster	1728				It's not good for the country and it's not right.	0
ClaimBuster	1729				Mr. Nixon resigned, and I became president.	1
ClaimBuster	1730				But we're going to have to work with the -- with the people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that they're on.	0
ClaimBuster	1731				Pakistan is -- is technically an ally, and they're not acting very much like an ally right now.	0
ClaimBuster	1732				The notion, though, that because we're not doing town hall meetings that justifies some of the ads that have been going up, not just from your own campaign directly, John, but 527s and other organizations that make some pretty tough accusations, well, I don't mind being attacked for the next three weeks.	0
ClaimBuster	1733				I worked 12 years very hard as a governor on the real problems of real people.	1
ClaimBuster	1734				How do you get anything done when you've got all of these political action committees, all of these thousands of registered lobbyists -- 40,000 registered lobbyists, 23,000 special interest groups -- and the list goes on and on and on.	1
ClaimBuster	1735				I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in -- in the United States of America and create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	1736				And that's a whole lot different from these fellows running up and down the halls whispering in their ears now and promising campaign funds for the next election if they do it.	0
ClaimBuster	1737				And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what's at stake in this election.	0
ClaimBuster	1738				I did support the '76 measure that he told about, because we were in a deep recession and we needed some stimulation.	1
ClaimBuster	1739				I will fight for your families and I will work every single day to make sure that America continues to be the greatest nation on earth.	0
ClaimBuster	1740				I just want to make sure that, I think I was supposed to get that last answer, but I want to point out that that I don't believe...	0
ClaimBuster	1741				I've recommended that our doctors be given a set of national practice guidelines and that if they follow those guidelines that raises the presumption that they didn't do anything wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	1742				You were totally in favor of it.	1
ClaimBuster	1743				I respect the President; I respect the Presidency, and I think he knows that.	0
ClaimBuster	1744				See, the card, it'll have a period of time attached to it.	0
ClaimBuster	1745				The entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	1746				Then you said we should.	1
ClaimBuster	1747				To me, that's the best way to secure America.	0
ClaimBuster	1748				We have preserved the safety net for the people with true need in this country, and it has been pure demagoguery that we have in some way shut off all the charitable programs or many of them for the people who have real need.	0
ClaimBuster	1749				I came away convinced that, if we worked at it, if we were ready to work and letting Hans Blix do his job and thoroughly go through the inspections, that if push came to shove, they'd be there with us.	0
ClaimBuster	1750				Maybe that was the purpose.	0
ClaimBuster	1751				The place where we've seen manufacturing go has been China.	1
ClaimBuster	1752				But have no doubt that Russia's behavior is certainly outside the norms of behavior that we would expect for nations which are very wealthy, as Russia has become, because of their petro dollars.	0
ClaimBuster	1753				We just have a different philosophy.	0
ClaimBuster	1754				But let's not go back to that-what they call supply management and production control, that'll simply price us out of the international market.	0
ClaimBuster	1755				We tried to overturn it in the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	1756				But not due to his policies.	0
ClaimBuster	1757				And the people of Serbia know that they can escape all those sanctions if this guy is turned out of power.	0
ClaimBuster	1758				And I think first you should -- I should understand that the question on your mind is do I understand your problem.	0
ClaimBuster	1759				There were many days that passed before we knew whether this was a spontaneous demonstration, or actually whether it was a terrorist attack.	0
ClaimBuster	1760				These terrorists are serious, they're deadly, and they know nothing except trying to kill.	0
ClaimBuster	1761				And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they don't want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements.	1
ClaimBuster	1762				The record is pretty clear in Arkansas, when you were governor.	1
ClaimBuster	1763				I think it's such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration.	1
ClaimBuster	1764				I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough.	1
ClaimBuster	1765				We try to help people with disabilities.	0
ClaimBuster	1766				And it seems to me that if you take a look, are you better off?	0
ClaimBuster	1767				Well, it's been a privilege to be able to talk to the American people tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	1768				I think it's accurate to say that in uh - two years ago when Mr. Nixon - Mr. Ford put in this uh amnesty that three times as many deserters were uh - excused as were - as were the uh - the ones who evaded the draft.	1
ClaimBuster	1769				I suggest that if Formosa is attacked or the Pescadores, or if there's any military action in any area which indicates an attack on Formosa and the Pescadores, then of course the United States is at war to defend its treaty.	0
ClaimBuster	1770				I do not suggest that Mr. Nixon does in any way.	0
ClaimBuster	1771				And I believe this Administration has not met its responsibilities in the last eight years, that our power relative to that of the Communists is declining, that we're facing a very hazardous time in the sixties, and unless the United States begin to move here - unless we start to go ahead - I don't believe that we're going to meet our responsibility to our own people or to the cause of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	1772				He still will not admit that he was wrong about the strategy of the surge in Iraq, and that's the same kind of strategy of go out and secure and hold and allow people to live normal lives.	0
ClaimBuster	1773				The jobs the president is creating pay $9,000 less than the jobs that we're losing.	1
ClaimBuster	1774				No child should be left behind in America.	0
ClaimBuster	1775				I think it's the tone.	0
ClaimBuster	1776				I think that the next president immediately after his election should sit down with the President, work out a timetable, and - get a decision on this before January of next year.	0
ClaimBuster	1777				The Senate was right because they knew the lesson of history.	0
ClaimBuster	1778				And for us to be able to make sure that they've got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids.	0
ClaimBuster	1779				And I finally -- I thought I didn't understand it -- called all the experts, and they said, oh, it'll be disruptive for 12 to 15 years.	1
ClaimBuster	1780				But what's really important here is to understand all the interplay.	0
ClaimBuster	1781				This is not a Wall Street tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	1782				And I think his present position is he would not do so, and if that's true I'm grateful for it.	0
ClaimBuster	1783				And let me tell you...	0
ClaimBuster	1784				I think we're ready to move.	0
ClaimBuster	1785				You've seen, as middle-income people in this country, incomes go down $4,300 a family, even as gasoline prices have gone up $2,000.	1
ClaimBuster	1786				I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.	0
ClaimBuster	1787				But more than that, they are role models.	0
ClaimBuster	1788				To leave this rather in the air, that we will defend it under some conditions but not under other, I think is a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	1789				I think it is good.	0
ClaimBuster	1790				I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS.	1
ClaimBuster	1791				And I haven't got time to answer with regard to the disabled.	0
ClaimBuster	1792				We have to make sure this program is there for the long term.	0
ClaimBuster	1793				Then out of that debate, with leadership, comes consensus.	0
ClaimBuster	1794				They are historic, they are strong, and they are enduring.	0
ClaimBuster	1795				But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees.	0
ClaimBuster	1796				And so I would hope that Senator Kennedy in his answer today would clear it up.	0
ClaimBuster	1797				And Colin Powell helped set up that summit.	1
ClaimBuster	1798				I think in many ways this election is more important than any since 1932, or certainly almost any in this century.	0
ClaimBuster	1799				You get to defer your taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	1800				So I know what it's like to have to look welfare head-on.	0
ClaimBuster	1801				The White House did not uh - prevent the release of that report.	1
ClaimBuster	1802				Look, as I travel around the country, this is the issue that will break your heart over and over again.	0
ClaimBuster	1803				And I favor the death penalty.	0
ClaimBuster	1804				We've had a 73% increase in the allotment of Federal funds for improved education.	1
ClaimBuster	1805				I have fought against special interests.	1
ClaimBuster	1806				And I think the American people understand it hasn't worked.	0
ClaimBuster	1807				I think it -- that we have a safer nation, but we are a long way from safe.	0
ClaimBuster	1808				One is the Middle East, and that is of interest to the whole Western World and the industrialized nations, because of the great supply of energy upon which so many depend there.	0
ClaimBuster	1809				Senator Obama, your argument for standing up to the leadership of your party isn't very convincing.	0
ClaimBuster	1810				She understands that better than almost any American that I know.	0
ClaimBuster	1811				I want the future of this country to be as bright and brilliant as its past, and it can be if we have the courage to change.	0
ClaimBuster	1812				They're going to have to make the decision themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	1813				Our schools are now better.	0
ClaimBuster	1814				When it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question.	0
ClaimBuster	1815				"And I believe the answer to that has to also be ""yes.''"	0
ClaimBuster	1816				I know many of her donors.	0
ClaimBuster	1817				That just happened, and many more are coming.	1
ClaimBuster	1818				George, we have supply management today under the 1985 bill.	1
ClaimBuster	1819				We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.	1
ClaimBuster	1820				But I also see a tremendous opportunity now to negotiate with the Soviet Union to build on the progress that we've made with the INF Treaty, which I strongly supported and most Democrats did to get those reductions in strategic weapons, to get a test ban treaty, and to really make progress on the reduction of conventional forces in Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	1821				Now we've got three of them.	1
ClaimBuster	1822				We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses.	1
ClaimBuster	1823				And I appreciate that question.	0
ClaimBuster	1824				That's a scare tactic, because it's not that many.	0
ClaimBuster	1825				We are a goldfish bowl before the world.	0
ClaimBuster	1826				And what I've proposed, you'll hear Senator McCain say, well, he's proposing a whole bunch of new spending, but actually I'm cutting more than I'm spending so that it will be a net spending cut.	1
ClaimBuster	1827				Most people want to see their own doctor.	0
ClaimBuster	1828				And under the plan that I've proposed, 80% of all family farms will be completely exempt from the estate tax.	1
ClaimBuster	1829				About fourteen to fifteen thousand did take advantage of that program.	1
ClaimBuster	1830				Well, that's what a President's supposed to know -- where those weapons are going to be.	0
ClaimBuster	1831				You go to your own pharmacy and then Medicare pays half the price.	1
ClaimBuster	1832				And this means more than what we've been doing.	0
ClaimBuster	1833				He said he voted for the $87 billion, and voted against it right before he voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	1834				Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable.	0
ClaimBuster	1835				And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don't want the cease-fire anymore.	1
ClaimBuster	1836				I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.	1
ClaimBuster	1837				If you own the land, every day is Earth Day.	0
ClaimBuster	1838				But as we learned in the same report I quoted, Saddam Hussein was gaming the oil-for-food program to get rid of sanctions.	1
ClaimBuster	1839				It took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group.	0
ClaimBuster	1840				They didn't go over to coddle.	0
ClaimBuster	1841				The question which we have to decide as Americans - are we doing enough today?	0
ClaimBuster	1842				And did the person have full access to the courts of law?	0
ClaimBuster	1843				Well, it's a great concern of mine and I think of all Americans, and perhaps the vice president can tell us what's been going on.	0
ClaimBuster	1844				Will women's rights be protected?	0
ClaimBuster	1845				Nobody's been luckier than I've been, all the way across the spectrum, and the greatest riches of all are my wife and children.	0
ClaimBuster	1846				We've got to give them the wherewithal to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	1847				This nation is the hope of the earth.	0
ClaimBuster	1848				But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	1849				Let's have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you.	0
ClaimBuster	1850				If I were President, I would also now take a look at the hundreds of Federal regulations which discriminate against women and which go right on while everyone is looking for an amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	1851				That's the way we leave it.	0
ClaimBuster	1852				Now, Senator McCain has a different kind of approach.	1
ClaimBuster	1853				Again, this is just a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	1854				Thirdly, one of the reasons why there's still high cost in medicine is because this is -- they don't use any information technology.	1
ClaimBuster	1855				We've done a long way working together to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	1856				And there was no demonstration involved.	1
ClaimBuster	1857				You get a catastrophic plan to help you on it.	0
ClaimBuster	1858				I know others disagree with it.	0
ClaimBuster	1859				Will we be better off if we start this star wars escalation into the heavens?	0
ClaimBuster	1860				Look, that's where World War I started in the Balkans.	1
ClaimBuster	1861				It's going to be tough fighting.	0
ClaimBuster	1862				And I think they deserve a family and medical leave act.	0
ClaimBuster	1863				And we have an opportunity now with improved transportation systems and improved loading facilities in our ports, to see a very good opportunity on a world international market, to replace OPEC oil with American coal as a basic energy source.	1
ClaimBuster	1864				That's not what we are going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	1865				But let's be clear: Earmarks account for $18 billion in last year's budget.	1
ClaimBuster	1866				Why I disagree with the MX is that it's a sitting duck.	0
ClaimBuster	1867				But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states.	1
ClaimBuster	1868				But the most important thing to relieve the pressure on all of the armed forces is frankly to run a foreign policy that recognizes that America is strongest when we are working with real alliances, when we are sharing the burdens of the world by working through our statesmanship at the highest levels and our diplomacy to bring other nations to our side.	0
ClaimBuster	1869				Thank you very much to the university, again.	0
ClaimBuster	1870				I represented upstate New York.	1
ClaimBuster	1871				I came from very modest means.	1
ClaimBuster	1872				The Vice President ignored them.	1
ClaimBuster	1873				I've got a strategy for the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	1874				I'm also going to talk -- respond to what you asked, Cheryl, at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	1875				First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.	0
ClaimBuster	1876				Fifty times we deployed troops around the world.	1
ClaimBuster	1877				But we will defend the citizens of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	1878				You've got about a million right here in Arizona, just shy, 950,000, who have no health insurance at all.	1
ClaimBuster	1879				There is a lot of blame to go around.	0
ClaimBuster	1880				That's one of the main reasons that we've had such an increase in the number of people employed.	1
ClaimBuster	1881				The right course for us is to make sure that we go after the -- the people who are leaders of these various anti-American groups and these -- these jihadists, but also help the Muslim world.	0
ClaimBuster	1882				We owe you a debt we can never repay you.	0
ClaimBuster	1883				And our ability to serve as an honest broker is something that we need to shepherd.	0
ClaimBuster	1884				Not only -- Even if we get all $700 billion back, let's assume the markets recover, we're holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit.	1
ClaimBuster	1885				You know, the vice president says he wants to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers, and yet his administration has a federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the country, which gave last year 7,000 furloughs to drug traffickers and drug pushers, the same people that he says he now wants to execute.	1
ClaimBuster	1886				You've got to reassert your ownership in this country and you've got to completely reform our government.	0
ClaimBuster	1887				And, no, I never proposed any $20 billion should come out of Medicare; I have proposed that the program we must treat with that particular problem.	1
ClaimBuster	1888				Off-road diesel engines -- we have reached an agreement to reduce pollution from off-road diesel engines by 90 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	1889				So we are peacemakers and we're peacekeepers.	0
ClaimBuster	1890				First of all, when we and our allies -- the Italians, the French, and the United Kingdom -- went into Lebanon, we went in there at the request of what was left of the Lebanese Government to be a stabilizing force while they tried to establish a government.	1
ClaimBuster	1891				I don't think we're a declining nation.	0
ClaimBuster	1892				I am for licensing by states of new handgun purchases.	0
ClaimBuster	1893				And I told the people exactly what the Congress exactly what kind of bill I would sign.	1
ClaimBuster	1894				The difference is we've got a new policy.	1
ClaimBuster	1895				I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families.	0
ClaimBuster	1896				I agree with the president that we have to go after them and get them wherever they are.	0
ClaimBuster	1897				So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire.	1
ClaimBuster	1898				The average income in some of those countries is twenty-five dollars a year.	1
ClaimBuster	1899				It puts a hair-trigger, and it is a dangerous, destabilizing weapon.	0
ClaimBuster	1900				So I salute these things.	0
ClaimBuster	1901				We have the right approach for the future and looks at the results.	0
ClaimBuster	1902				We have a higher unemployment rate in this country than Great Britain, and West Germany.	1
ClaimBuster	1903				But I don't think we need these other systems.	0
ClaimBuster	1904				The people in Washington are good people.	0
ClaimBuster	1905				By the time Congress comes into session to go to work, have those plans ready to go in front of Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	1906				We have to stop them from leaving.	0
ClaimBuster	1907				Described under your plan, Governor Bush, states would be required to pay vouchers to students to match the vouchers so that the federal government would put up.	1
ClaimBuster	1908				I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in Europe and Italy and the Pacific for freedom in World War II have now taken over in the United States, and that they're going to put this country back to work again.	0
ClaimBuster	1909				My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies.	0
ClaimBuster	1910				But when it comes to economic policies, essentially what you're proposing is eight more years of the same thing.	0
ClaimBuster	1911				I think that uh - we should protect our commitments.	0
ClaimBuster	1912				I've seen the tough times, I know they can be better and I'll lead America to a brighter future.	0
ClaimBuster	1913				I might say too, that - that if we see that these goals cannot be reached - and I believe they're reasonable goals - then I would cut back on the rate of implement- implementation of new programs in order to accommodate a balanced budget by fiscal year '81 which is the last year of the next term.	0
ClaimBuster	1914				We need to reform it.	0
ClaimBuster	1915				He said, well, if we have them, why don't we use them, which I think is terrifying.	1
ClaimBuster	1916				First of all, Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	1917				They're going backwards on the water quality.	1
ClaimBuster	1918				That's why I'd have regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	1919				For instance, we uh - completely revised our prison system.	1
ClaimBuster	1920				I think we can say, through the Packard Commission Report and I'm very proud that David Packard, the originator of that report, is strongly supporting me.	1
ClaimBuster	1921				I'm opposed to the death penalty.	0
ClaimBuster	1922				And I intend to get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	1923				Nothing could be further from the truth.	0
ClaimBuster	1924				Well, I certainly will, because I think that's a very fair and important question.	0
ClaimBuster	1925				The challenges that we face are unprecedented.	0
ClaimBuster	1926				But what I don't like is this left wing political agenda and therefore I have to help define that and if he's unwilling to do it, if he says ideology doesn't matter, I don't agree with him.	0
ClaimBuster	1927				I voted for the balanced budget in '93 and '97.	1
ClaimBuster	1928				But Detroit is being taxed for money that, let's say, will go to Chicago, while Chicago is being taxed to help with the problems in Philadelphia.	1
ClaimBuster	1929				And I'd be happy to discuss these other issues, but I can't believe he is accusing me of getting on both sides.	1
ClaimBuster	1930				He voted to increase taxes 98 times and to bust the budget 277 times.	1
ClaimBuster	1931				Let me give you a couple of examples, I guess, of the kind of person I wouldn't pick.	0
ClaimBuster	1932				With regard to Medicare, no, but it's time for us to say that Medicare is in pretty much the same condition that Social Security was, and something is going to have to be done in the next several years to make it fiscally sound.	0
ClaimBuster	1933				I don't think there is even a race between the two, it's about our vision for America.	0
ClaimBuster	1934				My plan also says it requires a new approach in Washington, D.C.	0
ClaimBuster	1935				And I don't think that's the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term.	0
ClaimBuster	1936				And when we compare the economic progress of this country in the Truman Administration with that of the Eisenhower Administration, we find that in every index there has been a tr- great deal more performance and more progress in this Administration than in that one.	1
ClaimBuster	1937				So it's pretty clear who doesn't want a trade war.	0
ClaimBuster	1938				But, I think it's very important to measure when and where things occurred.	0
ClaimBuster	1939				But it isn't going to get the job done if we don't change K through 12.	0
ClaimBuster	1940				We didn't ask for it.	0
ClaimBuster	1941				"And I believe the people, therefore, should be asked to make up their minds not simply on the basis of, ""Vote the way your grandfather did; vote the way your mother did."""	0
ClaimBuster	1942				Secondly, if you were so opposed to the grain embargo, why did you ask the godfather of the grain embargo to be one of your top foreign policy advisers?	0
ClaimBuster	1943				John Edwards is the author of the Patients' Bill of Rights.	1
ClaimBuster	1944				And I know from my experience in many campaigns that, if Senator Obama had asked -- responded to my urgent request to sit down, and do town hall meetings, and come before the American people, we could have done at least 10 of them by now.	0
ClaimBuster	1945				What was his participation there?	0
ClaimBuster	1946				We invested in a solar company, our country.	1
ClaimBuster	1947				As far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns.	0
ClaimBuster	1948				No, I -- look, we've got to fix the system.	0
ClaimBuster	1949				We're beginning to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	1950				I think the result of this debate indicates that that fact is true.	0
ClaimBuster	1951				And yet project strength in a way that promotes freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	1952				I'm for the Stealth, I'm for the D-5, I'm for going ahead with the advance Cruise missile.	0
ClaimBuster	1953				And yet, Mr. Bush says well, I don't think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees, when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured, that have to go to that hospital.	1
ClaimBuster	1954				And that's one of the reasons why my state has cut crime by more than any other industrial state in America.	1
ClaimBuster	1955				But the real thing we got to have is a competitive economic strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	1956				I read a report, or a memo, from somebody in his 1988 campaign -- I forgot the fellow's name -- warning then Senator Gore to be careful about exaggerating claims.	1
ClaimBuster	1957				It is not enough for us simply to be the strongest nation militarily, the strongest economically, and also to have firm diplomacy.	0
ClaimBuster	1958				There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	1959				This is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries, and it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to America, long term, and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism.	1
ClaimBuster	1960				Now, once there, we could have continued those inspections.	0
ClaimBuster	1961				I got into this race because I did not want my child to grow up to be part of the first generation of Americans to do worse than her parents.	0
ClaimBuster	1962				(Laughter, applause) Isn't that the point?	0
ClaimBuster	1963				And we're the most religious people on Earth.	1
ClaimBuster	1964				Mr. Benson, testifying on the food stamp plan in 1957, said there were twenty-five million Americans who could not afford a elementary low-cost diet.	1
ClaimBuster	1965				For 200 years, we've lived in the future, believing that tomorrow would be better than today, and today would be better than yesterday.	1
ClaimBuster	1966				We have to say to our friend in China, look, you guys are playing aggressively.	0
ClaimBuster	1967				She shouldn't be allowed to run.	0
ClaimBuster	1968				It's one of the reasons why we have a drug education and prevention program that is reaching out and helping youngsters all over our state, the kind of thing I want to do as president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	1969				uh - The estimate of the outside, if you eliminated all tax shelters, is 5 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	1970				He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	1971				Prosperity is not just going to trickle down.	0
ClaimBuster	1972				We go back and look at the healthcare plan that he wanted to impose on the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	1973				Hillary, you have no idea.	0
ClaimBuster	1974				I don't believe we need a good conservative judge, and I don't believe we need a good liberal judge.	0
ClaimBuster	1975				There've been 122 community and small banks have closed since Dodd- Frank.	1
ClaimBuster	1976				So, research, speeding the drugs to market, testing, blood supply are very important elements of this.	0
ClaimBuster	1977				One last point I want to make on energy.	0
ClaimBuster	1978				We can do that, we as Americans, because we're the best innovators, we're the best producers, and 95 percent of the people who are our market live outside of the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	1979				I think we need to fully enforce the law.	0
ClaimBuster	1980				Well I think it's uh... very difficult for President Ford to uh - explain the difference between the pardon of President Nixon and - and uh - his attitude toward those who violated the draft laws.	0
ClaimBuster	1981				Their currency has dropped 80 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	1982				But Obamacare has to go.	0
ClaimBuster	1983				We never increased sales taxes or income tax or property tax.	1
ClaimBuster	1984				Well, first of all, it is just not true that I haven't met with the Black Congressional Caucus.	1
ClaimBuster	1985				And when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times.	1
ClaimBuster	1986				If it hadn't been for us, Saddam Hussein would be sitting on top of three-fifths of the oil supply of the world and he'd have nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	1987				It's between a woman, God and her doctor.	0
ClaimBuster	1988				At the American Conference - Inter-American Conference this summer, when we wanted them to join together in the denunciation of Castro and the Cuban Communists, we couldn't even get the Inter-American group to join together in denouncing Castro.	1
ClaimBuster	1989				That's what distinguishes us from the enemy.	0
ClaimBuster	1990				But if there's one thing we also understand it is that you cannot make concessions to terrorists, ever, ever.	0
ClaimBuster	1991				It's pretty clear that was a quota case, and just because one teacher was white and one black and they had the same qualifications, you know they decided who would stay there.	0
ClaimBuster	1992				We have in the Dole-Kemp economic plan, unless unless your home's worth over 500,000 dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	1993				If you're going to sell a gun illegally, you need to be arrested.	0
ClaimBuster	1994				You also provide opportunity scholarships so low income parents will have the same choice that others have in sending their children to better schools.	0
ClaimBuster	1995				But I want you to think about just 2 or 3 things.	0
ClaimBuster	1996				We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries.	0
ClaimBuster	1997				If we have more people hired, if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get back all kinds of jobs into this country, then you're going to see rising incomes again.	0
ClaimBuster	1998				And we can see that in both Lebanon and in Central America.	0
ClaimBuster	1999				How could we have not known?	0
ClaimBuster	2000				I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals.	0
ClaimBuster	2001				Jim, the question you asked, if I heard you correctly, was would he support legislation to overturn it.	0
ClaimBuster	2002				If he keeps this up, he's going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics.	0
ClaimBuster	2003				The top 1% will pay one-third of all the federal income taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	2004				Now, we also can't return to a Cold War posture with respect to Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	2005				It seems to me that you have a selective memory.	0
ClaimBuster	2006				And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.	1
ClaimBuster	2007				That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?	0
ClaimBuster	2008				And before we react, I think it's best to have the full accounting, full understanding of what's taking place.	0
ClaimBuster	2009				Mr. Bush talked about values.	0
ClaimBuster	2010				Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters.	1
ClaimBuster	2011				We have done the following things: Number one, we've managed the aftermath of the Cold War, supporting a big drop in nuclear weapons in Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	2012				I believe that all of us are going to have to begin to work together to solve our problems.	0
ClaimBuster	2013				It's now 121/4, and I predict it'll be coming down a little more shortly.	1
ClaimBuster	2014				Number two, we've got to take care of this missile situation and try to get the nuclear war behind us and give this thing very high priority.	0
ClaimBuster	2015				President Clinton came to California in 1992.	1
ClaimBuster	2016				It's going to grow at a record rate of growth.	0
ClaimBuster	2017				The Ford administration will not let down, will not eliminate or forget our obligation to the people of Taiwan.	0
ClaimBuster	2018				I talk about the millions of people -- tell you one other thing.	0
ClaimBuster	2019				You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power.	1
ClaimBuster	2020				I sold them my remaining shares.	1
ClaimBuster	2021				It's a lot of money to protect other people.	0
ClaimBuster	2022				We still rank fifteenth among all the nations of the world in infant mortality.	1
ClaimBuster	2023				-- we haven't had the leadership in Washington to work on a bipartisan basis.	0
ClaimBuster	2024				And there's an enormous undone job to protect the loose nuclear materials in the world that are able to get to terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	2025				And there are a number of things.	0
ClaimBuster	2026				It was laughed at all over the world what happened.	0
ClaimBuster	2027				Now, Alan Greenspan, who I think has done a terrific job in monetary policy, supports the president's tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	2028				And I know they say it doesn't rank anywhere on the polls.	1
ClaimBuster	2029				We took our eye off the ball.	0
ClaimBuster	2030				Now, if that's true, just tell me now.	0
ClaimBuster	2031				If less money is coming in, you end up making cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	2032				"I didn't hear the word ""liberal"" or ""left"" one time."	0
ClaimBuster	2033				And they have not got it done.	1
ClaimBuster	2034				I know what's happened over the course of the past eight years.	0
ClaimBuster	2035				I'm ready to go at it right now.	1
ClaimBuster	2036				Well, folks, we got one, and that one is a financial crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	2037				"And when you looked into the camera in a debate with Senator Clinton and said, ""I will sit down and negotiate with John McCain about public financing before I make a decision,"" you didn't tell the American people the truth because you didn't."	1
ClaimBuster	2038				But understand this: We also have to look at where some of our tax revenues are going.	0
ClaimBuster	2039				And I understand that in certain capitals around the world that that wasn't a popular move.	0
ClaimBuster	2040				I think we have to demonstrate to the people of the world that we're determined in this free country of ours to be first - not first if, and not first but, and not first when - but first.	0
ClaimBuster	2041				Recycle those proceeds, then, back into the pockets of the American workers by reducing their tax payments.	0
ClaimBuster	2042				But I believe we have to have some way of checking hand guns before they're sold, to check the criminal history, the mental health history, and the age of people who are buying them.	0
ClaimBuster	2043				The plane wasn't flying the way it was supposed to be; it was a waste of money.	1
ClaimBuster	2044				No, you are the one that's unfit.	0
ClaimBuster	2045				Second, as we consider this problem of unemployment, we have to realize where it is.	0
ClaimBuster	2046				A lot of people, including me, said, look, it's not doing what it should do.	1
ClaimBuster	2047				But I think we need to be very careful in the present situation before we invite the Russians to play the lead role in mediating.	0
ClaimBuster	2048				Jim, I -- you may want to move onto another topic, but I -- I would just say this to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	2049				But on his very optimistic figures about his tax cut producing a balanced budget by 1983, and the fact that he is using, he says, the figures of the Senate Budget Committee, that Senate Budget Committee Report does not accommodate all of the Reagan defense plans.	1
ClaimBuster	2050				But until we're strong here, until we're moving here, I believe a summit could not be successful.	0
ClaimBuster	2051				This is what a president has to do.	0
ClaimBuster	2052				I think part of the answer to this haunting of these children that are out there and suffering lies in extension of Medicaid, to challenge the states, and maybe we're going to have to enforce more on the states in terms of Medicaid taking care of these.	0
ClaimBuster	2053				We didn't guard the borders.	0
ClaimBuster	2054				I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time.	1
ClaimBuster	2055				And if we did that, we'd have more consumption ability in America, which is what we need right now in order to kick our economy into gear.	0
ClaimBuster	2056				So what happened was we got distracted, we diverted resources, and ultimately bin Laden escaped, set up base camps in the mountains of Pakistan in the northwest provinces there.	1
ClaimBuster	2057				I feel very strongly the same place.	0
ClaimBuster	2058				There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	2059				But my economic program is the kind of change we want.	0
ClaimBuster	2060				And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	2061				There isn't any such thing as something free out there.	0
ClaimBuster	2062				May I disagree with the premise of your question?	0
ClaimBuster	2063				And so they're looking for ways to satisfy their desire for a better life and still reduce pollution at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	2064				That's what America's all about.	0
ClaimBuster	2065				"I'm running to be a president who happens to be Catholic. """	1
ClaimBuster	2066				I said I'd end the war in Libya -- in -- in Iraq, and I did.	1
ClaimBuster	2067				And all of these things are going to have to be addressed.	0
ClaimBuster	2068				And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson.	1
ClaimBuster	2069				And now we have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age to ban weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	2070				Where I part with the President is that despite all of those differences we must, as past Presidents before this one have done, meet on the common ground of survival.	0
ClaimBuster	2071				By far, the largest number in American history -- not just the big ones you read about, but a lot of smaller ones.	1
ClaimBuster	2072				So I think you're right and I hope the rest of the night belongs to you.	0
ClaimBuster	2073				And we've got a lot of work to do.	0
ClaimBuster	2074				And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we're also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy.	0
ClaimBuster	2075				I can see how tough that terrain is.	0
ClaimBuster	2076				By adequate preparation I mean that at that level we must prepare an agenda, an agenda agreed upon with the approval of the heads of state involved.	0
ClaimBuster	2077				In the last few years government has gotten bigger and bigger; industry has gotten larger and larger; labor unions have gotten bigger and bigger; and our children have been the victims of mass education.	0
ClaimBuster	2078				Tipper and I were good friends with Mel and Randy, and I know that all of us here want to extend our sympathy and condolences to Jean and the family and to the Sifford family.	1
ClaimBuster	2079				"Ann yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, ""Ann, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs."	1
ClaimBuster	2080				I understand there's great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions.	0
ClaimBuster	2081				Well I'm glad you asked.	0
ClaimBuster	2082				We've got a pilot program.	1
ClaimBuster	2083				About a thousand raised their hands.	1
ClaimBuster	2084				We also believe that in the great field of ideals that we can lead America to the victory for freedom - victory in the newly developing countries, victory also in the captive countries - provided we have faith in ourselves and faith in our principles.	0
ClaimBuster	2085				You really identified one of the really major challenges that America faces.	0
ClaimBuster	2086				I want to get one with Eastern Europe; I want to get one with Chile.	0
ClaimBuster	2087				She finally gave it up.	1
ClaimBuster	2088				And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics.	0
ClaimBuster	2089				They will be my first priority, not my election year concern.	0
ClaimBuster	2090				I mean, you may be sending a signal.	0
ClaimBuster	2091				That's what she told me her husband understood.	1
ClaimBuster	2092				Is this the time to unleash our one-liners?	0
ClaimBuster	2093				And we ought to be prepared to provide those funds.	0
ClaimBuster	2094				Now, I've got to correct a little bit of Senator McCain's history, not surprisingly.	0
ClaimBuster	2095				Unfortunately, we didn't have more questions on that.	1
ClaimBuster	2096				What message does that send our troops?	0
ClaimBuster	2097				I've taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.	0
ClaimBuster	2098				We need to keep that in line.	0
ClaimBuster	2099				And Governor Bush has declared to the anti-choice groups that he will appoint justices in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who are known for being the most vigorous opponents of a woman's right to choose.	1
ClaimBuster	2100				I mean, you say we've done all these bad things, which isn't the case.	0
ClaimBuster	2101				It's just pouring and destroying their youth.	0
ClaimBuster	2102				That gets rid of the third biggest intrusion of the federal government in our economy.	1
ClaimBuster	2103				We have not been updating from the new standpoint.	1
ClaimBuster	2104				We've doubled it on research and on every other aspect of it.	1
ClaimBuster	2105				But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	2106				September the 11th changed how America must look at the world.	0
ClaimBuster	2107				He has a one-point plan.	1
ClaimBuster	2108				I'm not satisfied to have fifty percent of our steel-mill capacity unused.	1
ClaimBuster	2109				And that's why, for example, on tax policy, what I want to do is provide a middle class tax cut to 95 percent of working Americans, those who are working two jobs, people who are not spending enough time with their kids, because they are struggling to make ends meet.	0
ClaimBuster	2110				We have gone from first to thirteenth in wages in the world in the last twelve years, since Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan have been in.	1
ClaimBuster	2111				Well, let's come back and talk about the military, but all the way -- all the way through.	0
ClaimBuster	2112				It didn't look good the first two years when we had a Democratic president and √É‚Äö Democratic Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	2113				When I was running -- when we had the debate in 2000, never dreamt I'd be doing that.	0
ClaimBuster	2114				I've devoted in the budget I've proposed, as I said last week, more than twice as much as the governor has proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	2115				Come on, that's not leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	2116				I'm not going to increase taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	2117				She's the 36th student in that classroom.	1
ClaimBuster	2118				This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make.	0
ClaimBuster	2119				Now that, of course, is just one factor, but it's a significant one.	0
ClaimBuster	2120				I sure stopped their budget.	1
ClaimBuster	2121				It would still have gone up as much as it has, and the $.50 would be added on top of that.	1
ClaimBuster	2122				You work harder and harder to make ends meet and put food on the table.	0
ClaimBuster	2123				They inform on the bad guys.	0
ClaimBuster	2124				And in exchange, if the states want to -- they're not forced to, they can choose to -- they cover individuals up to 300 percent of poverty.	1
ClaimBuster	2125				But he ought to apologize for wanting to take more and more.	0
ClaimBuster	2126				None of them ever get implemented because -- let me give you an example.	0
ClaimBuster	2127				We not only fixed Medicare and took it way out into the future, we did something that you don't know how to do: We balanced the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	2128				And so what I've done throughout my presidency and will continue to do is, number one, make sure that these countries are supporting our counterterrorism efforts.	1
ClaimBuster	2129				This has already passed the House, and it has an excellent prospect to pass the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	2130				I want a smaller and smarter government.	0
ClaimBuster	2131				I say it all the time.	0
ClaimBuster	2132				I've reached the conclusion that the Soviet Union is actually filibustering.	0
ClaimBuster	2133				In fact, what, Joe, if you want to do the right thing with your employees and you want to provide them health insurance, we'll give you a 50 percent credit so that you will actually be able to afford it.	0
ClaimBuster	2134				See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president.	0
ClaimBuster	2135				This is a responsibility of the president.	0
ClaimBuster	2136				I did avoid, I'm afraid, in my previous answer, also, the idea of uneven, yes.	0
ClaimBuster	2137				And I know he keeps saying, you want to take Detroit bankrupt.	1
ClaimBuster	2138				So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge.	0
ClaimBuster	2139				I think we should go back to Geneva, who's ever elected president, Mr. Nixon or myself, and try once again.	0
ClaimBuster	2140				So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.	0
ClaimBuster	2141				The Soviet Union sat at the table knowing that we had gone forward with unilateral concessions without any reciprocation from them whatsoever.	0
ClaimBuster	2142				He says don't do it, but the policies he's expounding of putting conditions on M.F.N.	1
ClaimBuster	2143				I believe that we need to export more so I'll keep working for export agreements where we can sell more abroad and I believe that we must strengthen the family.	0
ClaimBuster	2144				And I suspect, given his record, he's going to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	2145				Because of the uh - great -ly- greatly uh - advantaged uh - tho- per - persons who live in the suburbs, better education, better organization, more articulate, more aware of what the laws are, quite often this money has been channeled out of the downtown centers where it's needed.	0
ClaimBuster	2146				Uh - I can only say that my experience is there for the people to consider; Senator Kennedy's is there for the people to consider.	0
ClaimBuster	2147				Thank the University of Massachusetts and Mr. Vice President, thank you.	0
ClaimBuster	2148				Thank you, Carole, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen.	0
ClaimBuster	2149				I think these -- these actions taken by a president and a leader have symbolic significance and perhaps even material significance in that you'd hope that during that time we could call in the people who were actually eyewitnesses.	1
ClaimBuster	2150				When they had a 250 billion dollar tax scheme, that is half the size of this one.	1
ClaimBuster	2151				I prefer to take the overall percentage record of the last twenty years of the Democrats and the eight years of the Republicans to show an overall period of growth.	0
ClaimBuster	2152				Well, I believe that we did the appropriate thing under the circumstances.	0
ClaimBuster	2153				I've just finished reading a book, I think it's called -- what is it called, what is it, The Demise of the Democratic Party by Ronald Cardash (ph) or something talking about all the liberal influences in the administration.	1
ClaimBuster	2154				I believe America's best days are ahead of us.	0
ClaimBuster	2155				But as Senator Clinton said in her debates with you, we need to know the full extent of that relationship.	1
ClaimBuster	2156				My thanks to the League of Women Voters, to the panelists, the moderator, and to the people of Kansas City for their warm hospitality and greeting.	0
ClaimBuster	2157				I think it can only be that they're anticipating or hope -- expecting, not hoping, that maybe we don't have a control of inflation and it's going to go back up again.	0
ClaimBuster	2158				Of course we're doing everything we can to protect America.	0
ClaimBuster	2159				If we're saving money and managing resources better, that's a good thing.	0
ClaimBuster	2160				Jim, you permitted Mr. Bush to break the rules, he said, to defend the honor of the country.	1
ClaimBuster	2161				I said we'd transition out of Afghanistan, and start making sure that Afghans are responsible for their own security, that's what I'm doing.	1
ClaimBuster	2162				Well, when I got to be a part of the current administration, it was right after -- I was one of the few members of my political party to support former President Bush in the Persian Gulf War resolution, and at the end of that war, for whatever reason, it was not finished in a way that removed Saddam Hussein from power.	1
ClaimBuster	2163				Well, I'm not for registration.	0
ClaimBuster	2164				You've got to free up the private sector.	0
ClaimBuster	2165				Is that a new question or a 30-second question?	0
ClaimBuster	2166				Here are the key ingredients.	0
ClaimBuster	2167				And the American people don't have the slightest clue about what President Reagan will do about these deficits.	0
ClaimBuster	2168				If we don't get the economy to grow, if we don't cut taxes, and give people child credits, and cut the capital gains rate, and get this economy growing, we're going to limp into the next century.	0
ClaimBuster	2169				Do you think that our political institutions are working the way they should when literally only half of our citizens vote?	1
ClaimBuster	2170				What I object to -- [applause] -- what I object to -- what I object to is someone seeking to use his faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose it on others.	0
ClaimBuster	2171				Well, I think I should respond, because -- so ridiculous.	0
ClaimBuster	2172				And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.	0
ClaimBuster	2173				Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America.	1
ClaimBuster	2174				In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel.	1
ClaimBuster	2175				You're right, what does matter is a plan.	0
ClaimBuster	2176				Mr. Cronkite, I naturally am aware of it, because I, of course, pay attention to everything Senator Kennedy says, as well as Senator Fulbright.	0
ClaimBuster	2177				So it's the obligation of the president to do just that, and I intend to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	2178				I think the Communists have been moving with vigor - Laos, Africa, Cuba - all around the world today they're on the move.	0
ClaimBuster	2179				I have a plan to cover all Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	2180				I think it's an idea that would rip our country apart.	0
ClaimBuster	2181				So that's on the record.	0
ClaimBuster	2182				And it was terminated by current mayor.	1
ClaimBuster	2183				Now, another big difference is Governor Bush is proposing to open up some of our most precious environmental treasures, like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for the big oil companies to go in and start producing oil there.	1
ClaimBuster	2184				And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they're stuck.	0
ClaimBuster	2185				What should I have done?	0
ClaimBuster	2186				China and India are graduating more graduates in technology and science than we are.	1
ClaimBuster	2187				Well, maybe we bit off more than we could chew, but we're pursuing a step-by-step reform now.	0
ClaimBuster	2188				You don't muddle through stamping out the Taliban.	0
ClaimBuster	2189				Our troops have performed brilliantly.	0
ClaimBuster	2190				Yes, we tried, and, yes, we failed to bring him into the family of nations; he had the 4th largest army.	1
ClaimBuster	2191				Recently on a television program, he said it exceed our wildest expectations.	1
ClaimBuster	2192				We've created, and I'm not aiming at any one person here, I'm aiming at our government -- nobody takes responsibility for anything.	0
ClaimBuster	2193				We're actually drilling more on public lands than in the previous administration and my -- the previous president was an oil man.	1
ClaimBuster	2194				I want you to be on my team.	1
ClaimBuster	2195				I want to bring it back and get back good jobs and rising take-home pay.	0
ClaimBuster	2196				One seventh the total economy, 17 new taxes, price controls, 35 to 50 new bureaucracies that cost $1.5 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	2197				It's not a grand diversion.	0
ClaimBuster	2198				Yes, I mean, he's got a record.	0
ClaimBuster	2199				We do not have to go on sharing in scarcity with the country getting worse off, with unemployment growing.	0
ClaimBuster	2200				If you have time, go through Nexis and Lexis, pull all the old news articles, look at what Ambassador Glaspie said all through the fall and what-have-you, and then look at what she and Kelly and all the others in State said at the end when they were trying to clean it up.	0
ClaimBuster	2201				Now, we've seen 30 consecutive -- 31 consecutive months of job growth; 5.2 million new jobs created.	1
ClaimBuster	2202				It's how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot.	1
ClaimBuster	2203				Our allies feel that we've neglected them.	0
ClaimBuster	2204				We're going to have to coordinate with other countries to make sure that whatever actions we take work.	0
ClaimBuster	2205				The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people in the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened.	1
ClaimBuster	2206				Third thing I think we need is more forums like this, which is one of the reasons I have so strongly supported campaign finance reform.	0
ClaimBuster	2207				I think everybody's paying too much taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	2208				Well, I'm glad you raised that question.	0
ClaimBuster	2209				Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	2210				They currently favor going forward with a runoff election.	1
ClaimBuster	2211				We are going to have to make the Iraqi government start taking more responsibility, withdraw our troops in a responsible way over time, because we're going to have to put some additional troops in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	2212				Two hundred years ago, Tom Paine, when the 13 tiny colonies were trying to become a nation, said, we have it in our power to begin the world over again.	1
ClaimBuster	2213				Because you have nothing to say.	0
ClaimBuster	2214				Whether we're going to give our families more protection for their kids against drugs and tobacco and gangs and guns.	0
ClaimBuster	2215				My dad was born in Mexico of American parents; Ann's dad was born in Wales and is a first-generation American.	1
ClaimBuster	2216				And more recently, he talks about cutting the defense budget by five to seven billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	2217				The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship.	1
ClaimBuster	2218				He was a justice on the Supreme Court of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	2219				And the greatest repayment I can ever give is to recreate the American dream for your children and grandchildren.	0
ClaimBuster	2220				It's not just movies; television, video games, music, the Internet.	0
ClaimBuster	2221				And I have no apologies for our going on a peace mission.	0
ClaimBuster	2222				I would prefer that none of us had to pay taxes, including myself.	0
ClaimBuster	2223				A lot of my -- excuse me, Anderson -- a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed.	1
ClaimBuster	2224				And I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track.	0
ClaimBuster	2225				We welcome legal immigrants into this country.	0
ClaimBuster	2226				I know what it's like to have to fight to keep one's hope going through difficult times.	0
ClaimBuster	2227				And while I was there I worked on a bipartisan basis, as I did in the House, I worked with former President Reagan on the modernization of our strategic weaponry.	1
ClaimBuster	2228				The fa- the farmer who grows wheat gets about two and a half cents out of a twenty-five-cent loaf of bread.	1
ClaimBuster	2229				And plus, we cut taxes for everybody.	1
ClaimBuster	2230				With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb.	1
ClaimBuster	2231				He believes in the freedom of the Iraqi people.	1
ClaimBuster	2232				He says he's going to give you all a $5,000 tax credit.	1
ClaimBuster	2233				Our country has cut the welfare rolls in half.	1
ClaimBuster	2234				No, I'm not proud of that.	0
ClaimBuster	2235				We've had uh - Republican presidents before who've tried to run against a Democratic - uh Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	2236				I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul.	0
ClaimBuster	2237				I think you know because you've covered these issues, that there's no way that we can build all of the weapons the Vice President says he wants to build within the defense budget.	1
ClaimBuster	2238				"I, I still remember a woman that I met ten years ago who said she wanted to get off welfare so her kids could tell, give an answer when they say, ""What does your mother do for a job?"""	1
ClaimBuster	2239				Consider the distance between ourselves and -- and Israel, the president said that -- that he was going to put daylight between us and Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	2240				Now let me just tell you a little story.	0
ClaimBuster	2241				We really need to nail down the big intercontinental ballistic missiles, the ones that can hit us from Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	2242				And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody's ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you're never going to be able to use it.	1
ClaimBuster	2243				You also have investments outside the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	2244				Now, I believe that you can take that position and not be pro- abortion, but you have to afford people their constitutional rights.	0
ClaimBuster	2245				What we have to do, and this is the crux of the matter, is to make it very, very uh - difficult for a person who uses a gun in the commission of a crime to stay out of jail.	0
ClaimBuster	2246				I completely respect their views.	0
ClaimBuster	2247				To involve them in the administration of government and the feeling that they belong to the societal structure that makes decisions in the judiciary and in the executive branch is a very important commitment which I am trying to realize and will continue to do so in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	2248				So some may be better off.	0
ClaimBuster	2249				They feel we have to have strong borders.	0
ClaimBuster	2250				Most people are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	2251				You raise taxes and you kill jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	2252				I recognize that taking Saddam Hussein out was unpopular.	0
ClaimBuster	2253				That's one major war explosion in a warhead.	0
ClaimBuster	2254				I'd like to thank the hundreds of executives who came to Chicago, a third of them Republicans, who said they wanted to change.	1
ClaimBuster	2255				Well, where are the papers?	0
ClaimBuster	2256				The highest unemployment of any developed nation of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	2257				We're living in a new world after the Cold War, and what works in this new world is not trickle down, not government for the benefit of the privileged few, not tax and spend, but a commitment to invest in American jobs and American education, controlling American health care costs, and bringing the American people together.	0
ClaimBuster	2258				Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.	0
ClaimBuster	2259				I love the people here.	0
ClaimBuster	2260				And I don't have a list, but I think the appointments that the President has made to the Bench have been outstanding, outstanding appointments.	0
ClaimBuster	2261				But it's the right move not to join a foreign court that could -- where our people could be prosecuted.	0
ClaimBuster	2262				Let me come back and -- and answer your question.	0
ClaimBuster	2263				And to this day, not one of its decisions or rulings has ever been challenged.	1
ClaimBuster	2264				I think we ought to do plastic surgery on a lot of these guys so that they're all ears, too, and listen to you.	0
ClaimBuster	2265				Government does not create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	2266				In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions.	0
ClaimBuster	2267				You were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going to increase his taxes, which was going to cause him not to be able to employ people, which Joe was trying to realize the American dream.	1
ClaimBuster	2268				But when you're in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	2269				Governor Reagan says that this is not a good achievement, and he blames restraints on coal production on regulations - regulations that affect the life and the health and safety of miners, and also regulations that protect the purity of our air and the quality our water and our land.	1
ClaimBuster	2270				We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s.	1
ClaimBuster	2271				I personally don't believe that the federal government oughta finance abortions, but I - I draw the line and don't support a constitutional amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	2272				Were ready to go to work at the state and local level, all of us.	0
ClaimBuster	2273				One is to speed up generic drugs to the marketplace, quicker.	0
ClaimBuster	2274				We have made it less attractive for enterprises to stay here than to go offshore from time to time.	0
ClaimBuster	2275				Doing everything we can to control our own energy.	0
ClaimBuster	2276				Prime Minister Rabin gave his life because someone in his own country literally hated him for trying to bring peace.	0
ClaimBuster	2277				An all-volunteer army is best suited to fight the new wars of the 21st century, which is to be specialized and to find these people as they hide around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	2278				And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	2279				Because we've got a lot of people advocating we don't want to put our money into Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	2280				And we got some very good Republican women running.	1
ClaimBuster	2281				And that's why this enormous national debt, engineered by this administration, is harming these countries in fueling this immigration.	1
ClaimBuster	2282				And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability.	0
ClaimBuster	2283				We're doing it faster than any other state our size, comparable state.	1
ClaimBuster	2284				And in those two cases, I would favor them.	0
ClaimBuster	2285				I've been critical of this Administration and I've been critical of the President.	0
ClaimBuster	2286				The key is to control the cost and maintain the quality.	0
ClaimBuster	2287				And that means keeping our military strong.	0
ClaimBuster	2288				Finally, let me say this: as far as prestige is concerned, the first place it would show up would be in the United Nations.	0
ClaimBuster	2289				We've got to get the support of the people of -- of Pakistan.	0
ClaimBuster	2290				First of all, I'm going through from the very beginning -- we're going to cut about 5 percent of the discretionary budget, excluding military.	0
ClaimBuster	2291				And I hope we get a chance to talk about this more.	0
ClaimBuster	2292				And in my state I'm proud to say we've organized a drug education and prevention program which the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration says is a model for the country.	1
ClaimBuster	2293				(LAUGHTER) I am a person who keeps promises.	0
ClaimBuster	2294				I don't think we need 150,000 troops.	0
ClaimBuster	2295				Take it and get anywhere in America the health care that you wish.	0
ClaimBuster	2296				I think it's important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America, that we change our tax code to make sure that we're helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States, that we take some of the money that we're saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments.	0
ClaimBuster	2297				There's no doubt about it.	0
ClaimBuster	2298				Now look, if you want someone who will spend a lot of words describing a whole convoluted process and then end up supporting legislation that is supported by the big drug companies, this is your man.	1
ClaimBuster	2299				Crack down on China, if and when they cheat.	0
ClaimBuster	2300				But these are important questions.	0
ClaimBuster	2301				I said they need -- these companies need to go through a managed bankruptcy.	0
ClaimBuster	2302				I want to tell her, I'll fight for a prescription drug benefit for all seniors and fight for the people of this country for a prosperity that benefits all.	0
ClaimBuster	2303				Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment?	0
ClaimBuster	2304				I don't want to kill it off by a tax increase.	0
ClaimBuster	2305				I am proud to have been part of an administration that past the first catastrophic health bill.	1
ClaimBuster	2306				We've got to pay our troops more.	0
ClaimBuster	2307				We're going to get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	2308				The rich are paying a bigger percent of the total tax burden.	1
ClaimBuster	2309				This is the fourth time this has happened -- an identical attack, in the same region, despite warnings -- even public warnings -- from the terrorists.	1
ClaimBuster	2310				I support the death penalty.	1
ClaimBuster	2311				They've had eight years to get something done on Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	2312				I did a study on it; they're cost- ineffective.	1
ClaimBuster	2313				If you commit a crime with a gun, there needs to be absolute certainty in the law.	0
ClaimBuster	2314				Getting things done in three months that my competitors took 18 months to do.	1
ClaimBuster	2315				Got to keep going until all those nuclear weapons in Russia are gone and the other republics.	0
ClaimBuster	2316				So let's just, let's give credit where credit is due.	0
ClaimBuster	2317				Will our children be better off?	0
ClaimBuster	2318				I'm talking about a national mood.	0
ClaimBuster	2319				Once again, the president is misleading America.	0
ClaimBuster	2320				And there would simply be a delay, and on the other hand, many of the people who would then be given jobs are presently wards of the Government and it wouldn't hurt to give them a tax incentive, because they... that wouldn't be costing Government anything either.	0
ClaimBuster	2321				First of all, as I say, I don't think that -- we're not going to have another Cold War with Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	2322				Your mothers and fathers did the same thing for you and others.	0
ClaimBuster	2323				And I know that everybody uh - makes mistakes.	0
ClaimBuster	2324				Now he did use uh - ill-advised words, but I think in the fact that he apologized, that he was reprimanded, uh - does permit him to stay on and continue that kind of leadership that's we so badly need as we enter into uh - negotiations uh - under the SALT II agreement, or if we have operations that might be developing uh in the Middle East or southern Africa, in the Pacific, uh - we need a man with that experience, that knowledge, that know-how, and I think, in light of the fact that he has uh - apologized, uh - would not have justified my asking for his resignation.	1
ClaimBuster	2325				In other words, it doesn't converge as the President suggests.	0
ClaimBuster	2326				Our Government, in its most sacred documents - the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and all - speak of man being created, of a Creator.	0
ClaimBuster	2327				I will defend the right of Roe v. Wade.	0
ClaimBuster	2328				That's one of the problems with this administration's so-called shuttle diplomacy.	0
ClaimBuster	2329				I believe that if in all these years that we have spent trying to get the amendment, that we had spent as much time correcting these laws, as we did in California - and we were the first to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	2330				And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.	1
ClaimBuster	2331				I used to consult to businesses -- excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers.	1
ClaimBuster	2332				But the problem is, he hasn't described what exactly we'd replace it with, other than saying we're going to leave it to the states.	1
ClaimBuster	2333				So I think probably we're making a mistake night after night after night to cast the nation's future on a unit that small.	0
ClaimBuster	2334				That's not how you bring people together.	0
ClaimBuster	2335				That's why we included in the financial package a proposal to get homeowners in a position where they can renegotiate their mortgages.	1
ClaimBuster	2336				But let me tell you where the president's policies have put us.	0
ClaimBuster	2337				To me that's how you make society the safest it can be.	0
ClaimBuster	2338				But it's an honor that we have it.	0
ClaimBuster	2339				But we used that as a role model, the way he took understandable pride in his heritage, what his family means to him.	0
ClaimBuster	2340				First of all, I do have mandatory testing.	0
ClaimBuster	2341				Because the question you ask is important.	0
ClaimBuster	2342				How can something this serious occur in an administration and have a President of the United States in a situation like this say he didn't know?	0
ClaimBuster	2343				Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.	1
ClaimBuster	2344				There isn't any question but that we will defend our rights there.	0
ClaimBuster	2345				The people have to make up their minds.	0
ClaimBuster	2346				Let me restate uh - our policy.	0
ClaimBuster	2347				It just takes - from the people.	0
ClaimBuster	2348				But what I've also said is we can't just produce traditional source of energy.	1
ClaimBuster	2349				And I think the Vice President supported the Bork nomination.	0
ClaimBuster	2350				So we need to do the reforms and the term limits.	0
ClaimBuster	2351				Because we talked about what we wanted to do.	0
ClaimBuster	2352				And we have fundamental disagreements about the use of military power and how you do it, and you just saw it in response to previous questions.	0
ClaimBuster	2353				I have seen what's happened in this last 4 years when -- in my state, when people lose their jobs there's a good chance I'll know them by their names.	0
ClaimBuster	2354				How -- why would these people stay there?	0
ClaimBuster	2355				For those what I think we need to do is to develop an investment-type vehicle that would be an incentive for them to invest, like medical savings accounts with rollover capacity.	0
ClaimBuster	2356				We don't want our kids coming back here.	0
ClaimBuster	2357				Now, that's a certain passion that in my view it's misguided passion.	0
ClaimBuster	2358				I know it'll come as a surprise to Mr. Mondale, but I am in charge.	0
ClaimBuster	2359				So at least we have time to work with it.	0
ClaimBuster	2360				Over the next four years, we'll continue to insist on excellence in every classroom in America so that our children have a chance to realize the great promise of America.	0
ClaimBuster	2361				You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year.	1
ClaimBuster	2362				Secondly, I think we need to look at making the elections more accessible.	0
ClaimBuster	2363				They have not been forthcoming.	0
ClaimBuster	2364				Let me just answer one part of the last question quickly, and then I'll come to immigration.	0
ClaimBuster	2365				Wanda Blackmore I met here from Missouri, the first time she bought drugs with her drug discount card, she paid $1.14, I think it was, for about $10 worth of drugs.	1
ClaimBuster	2366				That's why we have to invest in advanced manufacturing.	0
ClaimBuster	2367				"I think the thing that discouraged me about the vice president was uttering those famous words, ""No controlling legal authority."""	0
ClaimBuster	2368				I will not privatize it.	0
ClaimBuster	2369				I believe that when you get into a w- if you're going to get into war for the defense of Formosa, it ought to be on a clearly defined line.	0
ClaimBuster	2370				I proposed to the United States Congress a Clear Skies Initiative to reduce sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury by 70 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	2371				We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that's happening.	0
ClaimBuster	2372				The most heavily directed, decorated solder in uniform when he retired.	1
ClaimBuster	2373				Our inner cities are a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	2374				That's what a governor gets to do.	1
ClaimBuster	2375				She had a small business with 63 employees.	1
ClaimBuster	2376				When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt.	1
ClaimBuster	2377				We can't have any test of race.	0
ClaimBuster	2378				And all I say is, I don't know what the sixties will bring - except I think they will bring hard times in the uh - international sphere; I hope we can move ahead here at home in the United States; I'm confident we can do a far better job of mobilizing our economy and resources in the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	2379				They rewarded him by opening negotiations with Iran to transfer nuclear technology.	0
ClaimBuster	2380				The fact-finding committee's powers are limited.	0
ClaimBuster	2381				He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes.	1
ClaimBuster	2382				Mr. Ellis, I think this idea that has been spawned here in our country that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore it's uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is entirely spurious and it's dangerous to say this to the people.	0
ClaimBuster	2383				In the reinventing government program you just look at the numbers.	0
ClaimBuster	2384				We are going to cut taxes massively.	0
ClaimBuster	2385				Oh, you mean the rules.	0
ClaimBuster	2386				I want to bring that change to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	2387				We've got a plan to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	2388				Thank you very much, Ann.	0
ClaimBuster	2389				The Congress can modify the supply of money by modifying the income uh tax laws.	1
ClaimBuster	2390				The -- the greatest failure we've had with regards to -- to gun violence in some respects is what -- what is known as Fast and Furious.	1
ClaimBuster	2391				Was √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì what was the question?	0
ClaimBuster	2392				This doesn't mean that the people aren't going to be paying the bill.	0
ClaimBuster	2393				And, there are eight other categories that should not have guns.	0
ClaimBuster	2394				I'm going to shut that loophole, and I'm going to give the tax benefit to the companies that stay here in America to help make them more competitive.	0
ClaimBuster	2395				What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	2396				And everything that I've tried to do, and everything that I'm now proposing for the next four years in terms of improving our education system or developing American energy or making sure that we're closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the United States, or closing our deficit in a responsible, balanced way that allows us to invest in our future.	0
ClaimBuster	2397				In other words, if we're going to continue to maintain our position in the sixties, we have to maintain a sound monetary and fiscal policy.	0
ClaimBuster	2398				I think we've given the American people back their spirit.	0
ClaimBuster	2399				When the president exercises his veto power, he has to have the people upo- behind him, not just a third of the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	2400				That's going to take money for infrastructure and investment to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	2401				I visited a Chrysler dealership in Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	2402				"Somebody here asked the question about, ""Why haven't you vetoed something?"""	1
ClaimBuster	2403				Half -- one out of two of the full-time college students in the United States are receiving some form of Federal aid.	1
ClaimBuster	2404				The president did not do what was necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	2405				And I would say, I don't know whether that's kind or not, it's just an objective statement.	0
ClaimBuster	2406				And Texas ranks 49th out of the 50 states in health care -- in children with health care.	1
ClaimBuster	2407				I don't think it's a question of whether people like you or not to make you an effective leader.	0
ClaimBuster	2408				I'm trying to decipher that.	0
ClaimBuster	2409				So if you're 60 or around 60 or older, you don't need to listen any further.	0
ClaimBuster	2410				I apologize to my family.	0
ClaimBuster	2411				Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.	1
ClaimBuster	2412				We're going to do that with regulatory reform.	0
ClaimBuster	2413				One was a bill for a dollar twenty-five cents an hour for anyone who works in a store or company that has a million dollars a year business.	1
ClaimBuster	2414				Thirdly, Arthur Gardner, a Republican Ambassador, Earl Smith, a Republican Ambassador, in succession - both have indicated in the past six weeks that they reported to Washington that Castro was a Marxist, that Raul Castro was a Communist, and that they got no effective results.	1
ClaimBuster	2415				He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt.	1
ClaimBuster	2416				With the American military forces nearby and in the field, we didn't use the best trained troops in the world to go kill the world's number one criminal and terrorist.	1
ClaimBuster	2417				The president mentioned that you need the right person in a crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	2418				So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies, and she caused the violence.	1
ClaimBuster	2419				This will give them availability.	0
ClaimBuster	2420				The governor, if it's a failing school, would leave the children in that failing school for three years and then give a little bit of money to the parents, a down payment on a down payment for private school tuition, and pretend that that would be enough for them to go out and go to a private school.	1
ClaimBuster	2421				I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.	0
ClaimBuster	2422				And he drew up this manual.	1
ClaimBuster	2423				He voted for the last two budgets that had that $24 billion more in spending than the budget that the Bush administration proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	2424				But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	2425				This is obviously a very tender topic.	0
ClaimBuster	2426				He's great as a -- as a -- as a speaker and describing his plans and his vision.	0
ClaimBuster	2427				We do and I hope...	0
ClaimBuster	2428				I would certainly also be judicious in evaluating any potential use of American troops overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	2429				That barely held even with -- if it did that much -- with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977.	1
ClaimBuster	2430				And, by the way, I like coal.	0
ClaimBuster	2431				We're doing better than a lot of the countries in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	2432				The reason I bring that up is because he's proposed $2.2 trillion in new spending, and he says he going to tax the rich to close the tax gap.	1
ClaimBuster	2433				Our country's in deep trouble.	0
ClaimBuster	2434				And I am -- I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA.	0
ClaimBuster	2435				We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	2436				Mr. Bush has said some very compelling things tonight that don't quite square with the record.	0
ClaimBuster	2437				I did support it at the time.	1
ClaimBuster	2438				That's why it's essential that we make sure that we keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of people like Al Qaida, which we are.	0
ClaimBuster	2439				So those are the kinds of things that we can now do because we're making that transition in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	2440				And we're going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here.	0
ClaimBuster	2441				But I'm not going to -- I'm not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for.	0
ClaimBuster	2442				(Laughter) Now, that's your tax money being wasted.	0
ClaimBuster	2443				And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.	1
ClaimBuster	2444				It ought to be not based on gender or ethnicity or color.	0
ClaimBuster	2445				So part of the reason I think it's so important for us to end the war in Iraq is to be able to get more troops into Afghanistan, put more pressure on the Afghan government to do what it needs to do, eliminate some of the drug trafficking that's funding terrorism.	1
ClaimBuster	2446				But there were a lot of families who didn't have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters or husbands didn't survive.	0
ClaimBuster	2447				Another thing is to deal with our - uh needs in the central cities, where the unemployment rate is extremely high: sometimes among minority groups, or those who don't speak English, or who're black, or young people, or - 40 percent of the employment.	1
ClaimBuster	2448				I'm sure your 6th grade kids are listening and saying, these guys will say anything to get elected.	0
ClaimBuster	2449				I've never seen members of a party locked out of meetings the way they're locked out today.	0
ClaimBuster	2450				I was in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat.	1
ClaimBuster	2451				That's why Senator Lugar says: incompetent in the delivery of services.	1
ClaimBuster	2452				Well, let's talk about what we need to compete.	0
ClaimBuster	2453				And don't take my word for it.	0
ClaimBuster	2454				Our tax rate for business in America is 35 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	2455				And it's one of the reasons why we have had the biggest drop in crime of any industrial state in America; why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in America.	1
ClaimBuster	2456				America remains the one indispensable nation.	0
ClaimBuster	2457				Government does not create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	2458				You've raised them by $1 trillion under Obamacare.	1
ClaimBuster	2459				And I think I have my strengths and I think the best thing going for Bob Dole is that Bob Dole keeps his word.	0
ClaimBuster	2460				I have described what has happened in Iran, and we weren't here then either.	0
ClaimBuster	2461				I will not agree to any arms control agreement, including a freeze, that's not verifiable.	0
ClaimBuster	2462				And what I've had to do is define, not just my position, but to define his and I hope I've done it fairly.	0
ClaimBuster	2463				But the fact that it is so strong enables us to project the power for good that America can represent.	0
ClaimBuster	2464				But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe.	0
ClaimBuster	2465				We had 7 billion this year and 10 billion more than the president.	1
ClaimBuster	2466				We have to make quality education there for all of our citizens, not just the privileged few.	0
ClaimBuster	2467				And give us a plan.	0
ClaimBuster	2468				We cannot frighten, as we have with the threats and the campaign rhetoric that has gone on in this campaign, our senior citizens - leave them thinking that in some way, they're endangered and they would have no place to turn.	0
ClaimBuster	2469				The harder you work, the more you can keep.	0
ClaimBuster	2470				And we've been through tough times but we always bounce back because of our character, because we pull together and if I have the privilege of being your president for another four years, I promise you I will always listen to your voices.	0
ClaimBuster	2471				I think it's the hard-working people of America's money and I want to share some of that money with you so you have more money to build and save and dream for your families.	0
ClaimBuster	2472				We knew he tortured his own people.	1
ClaimBuster	2473				It seems to totally belie the claim that I heard President Carter make a few days ago, that he was the first President that had come forth with a real urban strategy to meet the problems of urban America.	1
ClaimBuster	2474				But underlying that is loss of jobs and loss of income.	0
ClaimBuster	2475				And I believe I have sung at more weddings and more funerals than anybody ever to seek the Presidency.	1
ClaimBuster	2476				What I wish tonight so desperately is that we had had more time to talk about some of the other issues that are so fundamentally important.	0
ClaimBuster	2477				And people, Chris, will again go back to work and they'll make a lot of money.	0
ClaimBuster	2478				Obviously, this is another indication of trying to use the defense budget for political purposes, which he's trying to do tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	2479				And they want an American foreign policy that leads toward a safer world.	0
ClaimBuster	2480				But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot.	1
ClaimBuster	2481				The proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty.	1
ClaimBuster	2482				So health care needs to be affordable and available.	0
ClaimBuster	2483				Well, first of all, I appreciate enormously the personal comments the president just made.	0
ClaimBuster	2484				Let me make sure the seniors hear me loud and clear.	0
ClaimBuster	2485				Then, if the plans are huge and complex like health care, I would urge you to implement pilot programs.	0
ClaimBuster	2486				It's been a time, therefore, of illusion and false hopes, and the longer it continues, the more dangerous it becomes.	0
ClaimBuster	2487				And I've said mistakes were made.	0
ClaimBuster	2488				"""Oops, we haven't done the job."	0
ClaimBuster	2489				And we're organizing trade relations with countries other than China so that China starts feeling more pressure about meeting basic international standards.	1
ClaimBuster	2490				It wasn't failing to serve.	0
ClaimBuster	2491				It's with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	2492				I don't have an indoor gymnasium and an indoor tennis and an indoor every other thing they can think of; I don't have a place where I can go make free TV to send to my constituents to try to brainwash them to elect me the next time.	1
ClaimBuster	2493				I want the viewers out there to listen to what I have to say about it.	0
ClaimBuster	2494				That, I think, is a good balance.	0
ClaimBuster	2495				You don't turn national security into a political issue.	0
ClaimBuster	2496				I think that it basically has fallen.	0
ClaimBuster	2497				It had everything to do with energy.	0
ClaimBuster	2498				The President says it will disappear overnight because of some reason.	1
ClaimBuster	2499				We're not allowed to vote on it.	1
ClaimBuster	2500				The trillion comes from the surplus.	1
ClaimBuster	2501				I recommended to the Congress that we should increase production in this country from six hundred million tons a year to twel- a- a billion two hundred million tons by 1985.	1
ClaimBuster	2502				Is he talking about a former Governor of the State of California, who is a former prosecutor, a Republican named Earl Warren, because I think Chief Justice Earl Warren was an outstanding Chief Justice and I think most Americans do too.	1
ClaimBuster	2503				There we got more votes for condemning Hungary and looking into that situation than we got the last year.	1
ClaimBuster	2504				We've got a plan in place.	1
ClaimBuster	2505				That I can tell you.	0
ClaimBuster	2506				And President Bush has a very different path for a very different time.	0
ClaimBuster	2507				But it's gonna require people to bring both Republicans and Democrats together to get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	2508				How did we do that?	0
ClaimBuster	2509				I think what grows the economy is when we make sure small businesses are getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who fought for our country.	0
ClaimBuster	2510				We cannot have a lack of confidence in the blood supply when it comes to operations and surgery and things of this nature.	0
ClaimBuster	2511				Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system.	1
ClaimBuster	2512				Here's some thing that'll help.	0
ClaimBuster	2513				In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of -- I mean, these are unbelievable people that I've gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally.	1
ClaimBuster	2514				That's not the way to run our foreign policy, including international trade.	0
ClaimBuster	2515				"But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, ""I'll sit down,"" but you have to have a plan."	0
ClaimBuster	2516				And the way to do better is not to tax and spend but to retrain, get that control of the mandatory spending programs.	0
ClaimBuster	2517				And we've got to work with them if we are going to create an environment for human rights and democracy for the people of this hemisphere, and go to work on our single most important problem, and that is the avalanche of drugs that is poring into our country and virtually destroying those countries.	0
ClaimBuster	2518				I will not go back to the way the Democrats did it and used food as a political weapon and throw a grain embargo on the farmers in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	2519				I believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment.	0
ClaimBuster	2520				Her husband PJ got killed.	1
ClaimBuster	2521				And I say that those of us who stand against surrender of territory - this or any others - in the face of blackmail, in the s- face of force by the Communists are standing for the course that will lead to peace.	0
ClaimBuster	2522				And I believe that a fresh start, new credibility, a president who can understand what we have to do to reach out to the Muslim world to make it clear that this is not, you know -- Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq in order to go out to people and say that America has declared war on Islam.	0
ClaimBuster	2523				Values, judgment, and the record that I have amassed in my state also should count for something.	0
ClaimBuster	2524				I think it's very important that we reform our entitlement programs.	0
ClaimBuster	2525				But I do not want to go the tax-and-spend route.	0
ClaimBuster	2526				That will not help us compete with China.	0
ClaimBuster	2527				In 1977, we took that away from the military.	1
ClaimBuster	2528				I appreciate their idealism, their sacrifices.	0
ClaimBuster	2529				And I also think that we're going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities.	0
ClaimBuster	2530				Reform, prosperity, and peace, these are major challenges to the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	2531				Now, like uh - any hardworking uh - person seeking public office uh - in the campaign, inevitably sometimes you will use uh - rather graphic language and I'm guilty of that just like I think most others in the political arena.	0
ClaimBuster	2532				I think you'll find somebody who might interest you.	0
ClaimBuster	2533				And we need to reform.	0
ClaimBuster	2534				We spend more on our military than the next 10 countries combined; China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, you name it.	1
ClaimBuster	2535				And uh - the only purpose that I would see in registering uh - handguns and not long guns of any kind would be to prohibit the uh - ownership of those guns by those who've used them in the commission of a crime, or who uh - have been proven to be mentally incompetent to own a gun.	1
ClaimBuster	2536				I don't foresee those things happening, so I say with great confidence I'm not going to go for a tax.	0
ClaimBuster	2537				I'd like to leave you with the thought that the things I do as president are basically driven by the people whose lives I have seen affected by what does or doesn't happen in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	2538				Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states.	1
ClaimBuster	2539				Oscar, the question of what the federal government should do to limit the access of tobacco to young people is one of the biggest differences between Senator Dole and me.	1
ClaimBuster	2540				And that's the budget that we've put forward.	0
ClaimBuster	2541				I believe that that would help in terms of shelter.	0
ClaimBuster	2542				And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold.	0
ClaimBuster	2543				Most of this is due to regulations which either interfere with the mining of it or prevent the burning of it:.	1
ClaimBuster	2544				It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.	1
ClaimBuster	2545				And look at her website.	0
ClaimBuster	2546				All of them voted for freedom - a free type of government.	1
ClaimBuster	2547				But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that.	0
ClaimBuster	2548				And finally, I do believe in tax relief.	0
ClaimBuster	2549				He said if affirmative action means quotas, he's against it.	1
ClaimBuster	2550				When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community.	0
ClaimBuster	2551				I believe that we should defend Formosa.	0
ClaimBuster	2552				But the more immediate answer is to do what this lady was suggesting we do, and that is to get this deficit down and get on without adding to the woes, and then restructure.	0
ClaimBuster	2553				John, you want to give oil companies another $4 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	2554				And I believe that by eliminating ten million taxpayers in the last uh eight years, and by putting a heavier tax burden on those in the higher tax brackets, plus the other actions that've been taken uh - we can give taxpayers adequate tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	2555				There's only been one governor ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms, and that was me.	1
ClaimBuster	2556				The No Child Left Behind Act, incredibly enough, was good work between me and my administration and people like Senator Ted Kennedy.	0
ClaimBuster	2557				And I'm going to lead those troops to victory.	0
ClaimBuster	2558				We have literally Trump -- you can fact check him in real time.	0
ClaimBuster	2559				You don't have to go back to Herbert Hoover.	0
ClaimBuster	2560				Of course, the U.N. was invited in.	1
ClaimBuster	2561				And we have a very good fight.	0
ClaimBuster	2562				Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	2563				I would have put them in place earlier.	0
ClaimBuster	2564				I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	2565				So we're making progress but until we get that one done, we're not going to solve the neighborhood crime problem.	0
ClaimBuster	2566				I have said on a number of occasions exactly what I believe about the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	2567				First of all, I would be fearful that I might say something that was presently under way or in negotiations, and thus expose it and endanger the hostages, and sometimes, I think some of my ideas might require quiet diplomacy where you don't say in advance, or say to anyone, what it is you're thinking of doing.	0
ClaimBuster	2568				I'd just like to respond.	0
ClaimBuster	2569				We are now $120 billion of imports, 3 million jobs lost, and farmers are having their worst year.	1
ClaimBuster	2570				Well I don't think that in the winter of sixty-one under present economic conditions, it uh - a - uh - tax uh - increase would be desirable.	0
ClaimBuster	2571				And I just want to make one thing very clear.	0
ClaimBuster	2572				We have to make the Russians understand that there are penalties for these this kind of behavior, this kind of naked aggression into Georgia, a tiny country and a tiny democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	2573				"When he said, ""We're going to repeal Obamacare."	0
ClaimBuster	2574				Look, I want to make sure we use our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables.	0
ClaimBuster	2575				I got lots of relatives and they're good, average, middle-class, hardworking Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	2576				Well, first of all those are reports in the newspaper.	0
ClaimBuster	2577				The question is, was this wise?	0
ClaimBuster	2578				He rushed to war without a plan to win the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	2579				We have twenty different agencies in the federal government responsible for the production, the regulation, the uh - information about energy, the conservation of energy, spread all over government.	1
ClaimBuster	2580				President Eisenhower worked with a Democratic Congress very well.	1
ClaimBuster	2581				It means -- and I have to, again, repeat this.	0
ClaimBuster	2582				He discovered Boeing during the course of this campaign after I'd been talking about it for months.	1
ClaimBuster	2583				He has, in effect, said that he would agree with all of - he would disapprove of the vetoes that I have made, and would have added significantly to expenditures and the deficit in the federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	2584				Democrats or Republicans, it will be preserved.	0
ClaimBuster	2585				The key question that has to be answered in this election is will we use that prosperity wisely in a way that benefits all of our people and doesn't go just to the few.	0
ClaimBuster	2586				Number one, you make more making computer chips than potato chips; and, number 2, 19 out of 20 computer chips that we have in this country now come from Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	2587				It's an agenda that says we're listen to the young voices in Social Security and say we're going to think differently about making sure we have a system, but also fulfill the promise to the seniors in America.	0
ClaimBuster	2588				Why did she delete 33,000...	0
ClaimBuster	2589				We can't invest in science and technology, which will determine whether or not we are going to be competitive in the long term.	0
ClaimBuster	2590				I think that we've had something to do with that, just as we have with the drug problem nationwide.	0
ClaimBuster	2591				If you did that in the private sector, you'd be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	2592				I believe that we ought to have a balanced budget during normal economic circumstances.	0
ClaimBuster	2593				And I think that when the president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel, that they noticed that as well.	1
ClaimBuster	2594				And, as a result, America is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be.	0
ClaimBuster	2595				When you announce that you're going to launch an attack into another country, it's pretty obvious that you have the effect that it had in Pakistan: It turns public opinion against us.	0
ClaimBuster	2596				On economic policy, I associate with Warren Buffett and former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker.	0
ClaimBuster	2597				And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	2598				I've got a plan to control health care costs.	0
ClaimBuster	2599				First of all, we didn't find out he didn't have weapons until we got there, and my opponent thought he had weapons and told everybody he thought he had weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	2600				We need an answer to this problem, but it must be an American answer that is consistent with justice and due process.	0
ClaimBuster	2601				I would also like to point out that as far as Senator Kennedy's comments are concerned, I think he has a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this Administration whenever he thinks we're wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	2602				What he doesn't tell you is that he is going to tax your employer-based health care benefits for the first time ever.	1
ClaimBuster	2603				I think it's really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don't want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater.	0
ClaimBuster	2604				By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it.	0
