ClaimBuster	352	That is a very serious indictment of this administration.	0
ClaimBuster	353	Saddam Hussein is under a U.N. resolution not to threaten his neighbors or threaten his own, repress his own citizens.	1
ClaimBuster	354	We just have a different approach.	0
ClaimBuster	355	I congratulate him on -- on taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in al-Qaeda.	1
ClaimBuster	356	We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.	0
ClaimBuster	357	That's what should concern us, not the history of ten, or fifteen, or twenty years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	358	But let me mention another thing.	0
ClaimBuster	359	The facts are that he was systematically deceiving the inspectors.	1
ClaimBuster	360	And one of the reasons I felt so strongly that the United States needed to participate was because of our relations with NATO, and NATO is going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	361	If we fail, it's been a great serious failure for everyone - for the human race.	0
ClaimBuster	362	Well I believe we should use any and all means necessary to take out people who pose a threat to us and our friends around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	363	And that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know.	0
ClaimBuster	364	I want to invest in your family.	0
ClaimBuster	365	Well, look, I want to make sure that we are investing in energy in order to free ourselves from the dependence on foreign oil.	0
ClaimBuster	366	That's just one tiny example.	0
ClaimBuster	367	You should have shown up on the floor in the Senate and voted for it then.	0
ClaimBuster	368	When you don't have any ideas, I guess you say the other person's ideas are old.	0
ClaimBuster	369	Now here is the contrast.	0
ClaimBuster	370	I see the funding that is required, and I hope the Congress will fully fund this bill.	0
ClaimBuster	371	I thought that's exactly what he and Mrs. Clinton and them fought for in 1993 was a government-run health care system.	1
ClaimBuster	372	The goals ought to be an education system that leaves no child behind, Medicare for our seniors, a Social Security system that's safe and secure, foreign policy that's in our nation's interest, and a strong military, and then bring people together to achieve those goals.	0
ClaimBuster	373	I think it's going to require a combination of supply management and reasonable price supports to make sure that our farmers get a decent price and I think it also is going to require an administration that understand that there are tremendous opportunities out there for the development of new uses for agricultural products, new uses which can help us to clean up our environment at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	374	The fact of the matter is that the next president of the United States is going to have to go to the White House seriously, he is going to have to work with the Congress seriously he can't turn to the Congress and blame them for the fact that we don't have a balanced budget and that we have billions and billions of dollars in red ink.	0
ClaimBuster	375	If they had a pre-existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all.	0
ClaimBuster	376	The auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride, that they're helping to build America.	1
ClaimBuster	377	We've got to do both, and that's exactly what my plan does.	1
ClaimBuster	378	We've got to move ahead with the strategic arms negotiation process, with the comprehensive test ban treaty and with negotiations leading to conventional force reduction in Europe with deeper cuts on the Soviet side and Senator Bentsen and I will pursue that policy.	0
ClaimBuster	379	I don't think the surplus exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the federal government, I think it exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	380	That happens to be a fact.	1
ClaimBuster	381	We can do all of those things, and at the same time build a future in which we are standing on a good strong fiscal foundation.	0
ClaimBuster	382	I've met some of those people.	1
ClaimBuster	383	I will issue a white paper after this broadcast, quoting exactly what he said on compulsory arbitration, for example, and the record will show that I have been correct.	0
ClaimBuster	384	Thirdly, I think the question before the American people is: as they look at this country and as they look at the world around them, the goals are the same for all Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	385	And that's why I must say I agree with General Colin Powell that we're not there yet.	0
ClaimBuster	386	This costs our uh - government about uh - $1.4 billion a year.	1
ClaimBuster	387	I was just going to -- --	0
ClaimBuster	388	We have to change this whole culture.	0
ClaimBuster	389	And we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat.	0
ClaimBuster	390	You can run, but you can't hide.	0
ClaimBuster	391	I regret the things in my own long campaign that have been mistaken, but I'm trying to do away with those the last ten days.	0
ClaimBuster	392	A lot of them are thrown out because of all the scandals.	0
ClaimBuster	393	The farmer produced these surpluses because the government asked him to through legislation during the war.	1
ClaimBuster	394	That requires a cool hand at the tiller.	0
ClaimBuster	395	We have reduced the number of people in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines from three million, one hundred - three million, five hundred thousand to two mil- lion one hundred thousand.	1
ClaimBuster	396	The president's done nothing to try to fix it.	1
ClaimBuster	397	You know that I mean what I say.	0
ClaimBuster	398	But I think it's important to understand, we're not going to solve Social Security and Medicare unless we understand the rest of our tax policies.	0
ClaimBuster	399	I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example.	0
ClaimBuster	400	I just told you about this manufacturing job loss which is going to increase.	1
ClaimBuster	401	You have questioned my patriotism.	0
ClaimBuster	402	I believe that inflation today is caused by government simply spending more than government takes in, at the same time that government has imposed upon business and industry, from the shopkeeper on the corner to the biggest industrial plant in America, countless harassing regulations and punitive taxes that have reduced productivity at the same time they have increased the cost of production.	0
ClaimBuster	403	Well, that bill has not yet come down to the Oval Office, so I am not in a position to make any judgment on it tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	404	So I don't -- I don't think there's any doubt that Senator Obama wants to restrict trade and he wants to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	405	He is the leader of that country.	1
ClaimBuster	406	As an aid to enlistment.	0
ClaimBuster	407	There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there.	0
ClaimBuster	408	And if you answer all of those questions yes, why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for.	0
ClaimBuster	409	And so we ought to do everything we can to end racial profiling.	0
ClaimBuster	410	The president relied on Afghan warlords and he outsourced that job too.	1
ClaimBuster	411	So in my state we toughen up the juvenile justice laws.	1
ClaimBuster	412	When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test.	1
ClaimBuster	413	An issue I have been involved in for many, many years and I'm proud of the work of the work that I've done there along with Senator Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	414	And incidentally, Senator Johnson was among those who rejected that position - voted with the seventy against the twelve.	1
ClaimBuster	415	It was to go into a time capsule and would be read in 100 years when that time capsule was opened.	1
ClaimBuster	416	Keep the government as far out of it as possible, make insurance available to the poorest of the poor, through vouchers, next range in the income bracket, through tax credits, and get on about the business of pooling insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	417	But the federal government also can play a very important role.	0
ClaimBuster	418	And so, we've got a good military.	0
ClaimBuster	419	We have spent their money.	1
ClaimBuster	420	We've got thousands and thousands of homes owned by government boarded up, being vandalized, that have been taken in mortgage foreclosures.	1
ClaimBuster	421	He tends to distort on a number of occasions.	0
ClaimBuster	422	Let's make our schools safe, let's make our neighborhoods safe.	0
ClaimBuster	423	You just heard the president say that young people ought to be able to take money out of Social Security and put it in their own accounts.	1
ClaimBuster	424	You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes.	0
ClaimBuster	425	He's for letting the oil companies into the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.	1
ClaimBuster	426	This is fact slinging -- a bill earlier this year.	0
ClaimBuster	427	These are the-my answer is do not make these unilateral cuts, and everybody now realizes that peace through strength works, and so this is where I have a big difference.	0
ClaimBuster	428	And I believe when the average hour for many farmers' wage is about fifty cents an hour, he should do better.	0
ClaimBuster	429	We've got to rebuild our military.	0
ClaimBuster	430	Thank goodness we had a Republican Congress there.	1
ClaimBuster	431	And affirmative action is not just something that applies to people of color.	0
ClaimBuster	432	If it is a well-known fact that I opposed air pollution laws in California, the only thing I can possibly think of is that the President must be suggesting the law that the Federal Government tried to impose on the State of California - not a law, but regulations - that would have made it impossible to drive an automobile within the city limits of any California city, or to have a place to put it if you did drive it against their regulations.	1
ClaimBuster	433	And talk about the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	434	The HMOs are against the patient's rights bill, the Dingle-Norwood bill that I support, and that Gov.	1
ClaimBuster	435	The FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails.	1
ClaimBuster	436	AARP thinks that the -- the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	437	This is the most liberal big-spending record in the United States Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	438	You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system.	1
ClaimBuster	439	There also isn't any question but that the free people of Cuba - the people who want to be free - are going to be supported and that they will attain their freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	440	We need somebody to simplify the code, to be fair, to continue prosperity by sharing some of the surplus with the people who pay the bills, particularly those at the bottom end of the economic ladder.	0
ClaimBuster	441	Now, have I got that wrong?	0
ClaimBuster	442	And long before President Bush and I get a tax cut -- and that's who gets it -- long before we do, I'm going to invest in homeland security and I'm going to make sure we're not cutting COPS programs in America and we're fully staffed in our firehouses and that we protect the nuclear and chemical plants.	1
ClaimBuster	443	And that's really what this campaign is going to be about.	0
ClaimBuster	444	And that's why I think it's so important for us to reverse course, because that's the central front on terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	445	But make no mistake about it, we should do everything we can to see that the will of the Serbian people expressed in this extraordinary election is done.	0
ClaimBuster	446	I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	447	Now, let me pose this question to America.	0
ClaimBuster	448	Just so you put it out.	0
ClaimBuster	449	Now, there are people who go to bed hungry in the United States - far less, incidentally, than used to go to bed hungry when we came into power at the end of the Truman Administration.	0
ClaimBuster	450	We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out.	0
ClaimBuster	451	That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted.	0
ClaimBuster	452	I ask each of you just to look into your hearts, look into your guts.	0
ClaimBuster	453	Now, on arms control, we're completing 4 years.	1
ClaimBuster	454	I think, for example, take -- when they took 40 million acres of land out of circulation without consulting local officials, I thought that was --	0
ClaimBuster	455	And that's saying something in that bunch.	0
ClaimBuster	456	He was hoping to turn a blind eye.	0
ClaimBuster	457	Nobody who's looked at it that's serious, actually believes it adds up.	0
ClaimBuster	458	Secondly, with respect to parental notification, I'm not going to require a 16-or 17-year-old kid who's been raped by her father and who's pregnant to have to notify her father.	0
ClaimBuster	459	"He said, ""I'll get back to you."""	1
ClaimBuster	460	I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers.	0
ClaimBuster	461	We know nothing about them.	1
ClaimBuster	462	And I pushed for some core principles: making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if they're putting money up.	1
ClaimBuster	463	And so what I'm trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally.	0
ClaimBuster	464	He said he would have by now put forward a plan to reform Medicare and Social Security, because he pointed out they're on the road to bankruptcy.	1
ClaimBuster	465	And I can only say that I'm very proud that President Eisenhower restored dignity and decency and, frankly, good language to the conduct of the presidency of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	466	And by holding the lid on federal spending we have been able to do an- a good job, an affirmative job in inflation and as a result have added to the jobs in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	467	And I think this is uh - uh - part of uh - of just being a human being.	0
ClaimBuster	468	Our association and connection with our allies is essential to America's strength.	0
ClaimBuster	469	And she's going after fact after fact, and she's lying again, because she said she -- you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine.	1
ClaimBuster	470	These are people that care, that are trying to give of themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	471	Now maybe it's better just to get together and sit down and talk.	0
ClaimBuster	472	He repeated it again in a television debate that we had.	1
ClaimBuster	473	We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	474	One of my promises is going to be Social Security reform, and you bet, we need to take a trillion dollars out of that $2.4 trillion surplus.	1
ClaimBuster	475	And those that I haven't been able to keep, it's not for lack of trying and we're going to get it done in a second term.	0
ClaimBuster	476	There are some who allege, I can't prove it true or untrue, that uh - such a statement uh - in effect invited the North Koreans to invade South Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	477	That's right at the top of my agenda.	0
ClaimBuster	478	"I remember going down to the basement of the White House the day we committed our troops as last resort, looking at Tommy Franks and the generals on the ground, asking them, ""Do we have the right plan with the right troop level?"""	1
ClaimBuster	479	I support it and the Pescadores Island.	0
ClaimBuster	480	That's one of the big reasons I vetoed it.	1
ClaimBuster	481	What happens in South Africa, where, for example, the Nobel Prize winner, 2 days ago, said this administration is seen as working with the oppressive government of South Africa.	1
ClaimBuster	482	I understand that we must find Al Qaida wherever they hide.	0
ClaimBuster	483	It's going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker -- Democratic Speaker Tip O'Neill.	0
ClaimBuster	484	And it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him.	0
ClaimBuster	485	They make $51,000 combined income, they pay about $3500 in taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	486	I brought this up recently with Vincent Fox the newly elected president in Mexico, he's a man I know from Mexico.	1
ClaimBuster	487	"I think ""punish"" is the wrong word."	0
ClaimBuster	488	And some say that that's what Putin intended in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	489	We're going to have a good economic package.	0
ClaimBuster	490	I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization.	0
ClaimBuster	491	You put $90 billion into -- into green jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	492	The misery index -- unemployment and inflation added together -- it was invented by the Democrats -- went right through the roof.	1
ClaimBuster	493	This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history.	0
ClaimBuster	494	Weapons of mass destruction, nuclear proliferation.	0
ClaimBuster	495	But let me also note that as I said earlier, we're going to have to do more than just going after leaders and -- and killing bad guys, important as that is.	0
ClaimBuster	496	And I'm going to work together with Congress to say, OK, what -- what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance?	0
ClaimBuster	497	Uh - I have made other recommendations after each of the other trips; for example, after my trip abroad to Hungary I made some recommendations with regard to the Hungarian refugee situation which were adopted, not only by the President but some of them were enacted into law by the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	498	But if I found somebody that had a conflict of interest that would try to illegally do something as a foreign -- registered lobby, the laws cover this.	1
ClaimBuster	499	It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship.	0
ClaimBuster	500	And that's all I'm trying to do, is put it in focus.	0
ClaimBuster	501	I believe the answer lies in just recognizing human nature and how we make everything else work in this country, when we want it to work.	0
ClaimBuster	502	If we grow the economy it's going to help Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	503	You add all the states that've used the instant check and how many weapons they keep, kept out of the hands of criminals.	0
ClaimBuster	504	They surely don't let me do that.	0
ClaimBuster	505	I'm not satisfied when we are failing to develop the natural resources of the United States to the fullest.	0
ClaimBuster	506	And let me cite several examples.	0
ClaimBuster	507	But I don't think that we can ignore the role played by guns.	0
ClaimBuster	508	I went to the Olympics when they were in trouble to try and get them on track.	1
ClaimBuster	509	When Mr. Nitze, a good negotiator, returned, he was rebuked, and his boss was fired.	1
ClaimBuster	510	(LAUGHTER) I said I'd do four things; tort reform, education reform, welfare reform and juvenile justice reform.	1
ClaimBuster	511	With the fiscal program that I have, and if you look at the projections, it shows that we will reduce unemployment, that we will continue to win the battle against inflation, and at the same time give the kind of quality of life that I believe is possible in America.	0
ClaimBuster	512	In our economic plan, the $500 child credit can be used for young people, rolled over and over and over, you, of course not this age, but if you have a child two years old, 7 percent interest would be worth about $18,000 by the time that child was ready for college.	1
ClaimBuster	513	I want to say in the beginning that I am profoundly grateful for the chance that you have given me to serve as president for the last four years.	1
ClaimBuster	514	I think the only people that are going to show up to register or get a license -- I guess licensing like a driver's license for a gun, the only people that are going to show up are law-abiding citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	515	We comprise about 30 percent of the world's economic trade power influence.	1
ClaimBuster	516	And he'll do very well when we get into the debates.	0
ClaimBuster	517	But this will make a difference in terms of whether or not we can move this economy forward for these young people...	0
ClaimBuster	518	These are accounts that allow somebody to buy a low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax-free savings.	1
ClaimBuster	519	I'm a guy who wants to help with the experience I have, the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	520	If we're going to protect American children and American families and people who live as prisoners in their own home, we've got to stop guns from being dumped on the street.	0
ClaimBuster	521	Now that was gone into by two congressional committees, and following that investigation, both committees overwhelmingly approved me, and the House and the Senate did likewise.	1
ClaimBuster	522	It's time to put the American people first, to invest and grow this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	523	And at that point, we can pick from a variety of plans and develop new plans.	0
ClaimBuster	524	And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands.	0
ClaimBuster	525	That is not going to work.	0
ClaimBuster	526	And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.	1
ClaimBuster	527	I think there's enough -- we're even looking at our tax cut proposal, our economic package.	0
ClaimBuster	528	I propose an American version of what works in other countries -- I think we can do it better: invest and grow.	0
ClaimBuster	529	Well, we've just finished almost the whole debate.	0
ClaimBuster	530	You did everything you could to kill the Clean Water Act	1
ClaimBuster	531	I can -- and thanks, Washington U. as well.	0
ClaimBuster	532	I will just say my time is running out here.	0
ClaimBuster	533	And then we would have to start all over again.	0
ClaimBuster	534	You can't carry a gun into a school.	0
ClaimBuster	535	Well, the President doesn't have it quite right.	0
ClaimBuster	536	I think it makes the world safer and, frankly, it makes the United States safer.	0
ClaimBuster	537	I know that the economic program that I have proposed for this nation in the next few years can resolve many of the problems that trouble us today.	0
ClaimBuster	538	Well, I think it will continue to be terrorist networks.	0
ClaimBuster	539	You can't worry about polls or focus groups.	0
ClaimBuster	540	That's the stuff that campaigns should be made of.	0
ClaimBuster	541	But we did factor in our own ideas with regard to increases in the projected military spending that we believe would, over a period of time, do what is necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	542	It was once called voodoo economics.	1
ClaimBuster	543	We can offshore drill now.	1
ClaimBuster	544	In the 2000 debates, there was no mention of terrorism, for instance.	1
ClaimBuster	545	That was the key legislation at the time and put us on the road to eliminating this issue of nuclear waste and the nuclear fuel that has to be taken care of.	0
ClaimBuster	546	We uphold the standards of conduct which they would never follow.	0
ClaimBuster	547	We are going to need more cooperation with our allies.	0
ClaimBuster	548	Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, others, knew how to lead.	0
ClaimBuster	549	And I have -- well, not quite that long.	0
ClaimBuster	550	And if indeed all the jobs were going to move south because there are lower wages, there are lower wages now and they haven't done that.	1
ClaimBuster	551	You did, Ann heard of him.	0
ClaimBuster	552	I'm also opposed to a plan that diverts 1 out of every $6 away from the Social Security Trust Fund.	1
ClaimBuster	553	Why, I had a great response to that.	1
ClaimBuster	554	Nineteen fifty-three we tried to put an appropriation of five billion dollars for our defenses.	1
ClaimBuster	555	Now, I doubt anybody here makes more than $330,000 a year.	0
ClaimBuster	556	Now there are some things we can do to help people who currently do get entitlements to get off public assistance.	0
ClaimBuster	557	And none of these things happened.	1
ClaimBuster	558	Once you automate your records, then you don't have to have a waiting period, but at least you can check.	0
ClaimBuster	559	My intentions in the field of civil rights have been spelled out in the Republican platform.	1
ClaimBuster	560	All the people who may still be watching or viewing.	0
ClaimBuster	561	It's a very unstable situation.	0
ClaimBuster	562	This is the biggest turnaround in the history of the country.	1
ClaimBuster	563	We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI.	1
ClaimBuster	564	He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women.	1
ClaimBuster	565	You can't tell me that on the day that we went into that war and it started -- it was principally the United States, the America and Great Britain and one or two others.	0
ClaimBuster	566	After this year is over, we'll resolve it just as we did with Social Security in `83.	1
ClaimBuster	567	We should have our differences.	0
ClaimBuster	568	But on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new.	0
ClaimBuster	569	You look at the record of the last four years and say is Iran closer to a bomb?	0
ClaimBuster	570	We're going to have a new Congress, and we're going to say to them, you've listened to the voters the way we have.	0
ClaimBuster	571	That crime bill is going to be one of my highest priorities next January if I become president.	0
ClaimBuster	572	To those of you in the audience who are business people: pretty simple.	0
ClaimBuster	573	And with our economy in such terrible disarray and getting worse by the month.	0
ClaimBuster	574	Republicans wanted to have just a majority vote to confirm a judge and the Democrats were blocking in an unprecedented fashion.	1
ClaimBuster	575	That's why -- to go back to your question -- I want to send a message -- we all should -- to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.	0
ClaimBuster	576	I do not suggest in any way, nor have I ever, that that indicates that Mr. Nixon has the slightest sympathy, involvement, or in any way imply any inferences in regard to the Ku Klux Klan.	0
ClaimBuster	577	I wish that he would consider changing his mind on that.	0
ClaimBuster	578	I do think this, though.	0
ClaimBuster	579	I think that we also have to keep a weather eye toward Saddam Hussein because he is taking advantage of this situation to once again make threats, and he needs to understand that he's not only dealing with Israel, he is dealing -- he's dealing with us if he is making the kind of threats that he's talking about there.	0
ClaimBuster	580	And we ought to try to meet the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	581	The President trusts the government.	0
ClaimBuster	582	It's very clear to me.	0
ClaimBuster	583	Well, it's cost-effective to help Russia succeed in its revolution; it's pennies on the dollar compared to going back to the Cold War.	1
ClaimBuster	584	Morale in today's military is too low.	0
ClaimBuster	585	Uh the Federal Reserve Board indicated that the supply of money would be held between four to four and a half and seven and seven and a half.	1
ClaimBuster	586	The president just said the FBI had changed its culture.	0
ClaimBuster	587	I mean, this is a little defensive on your part, Susan, to be honest with you.	0
ClaimBuster	588	There is a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	589	But it's very clear that I have disagreed with the Bush administration.	1
ClaimBuster	590	When they voted -- when they proposed reducing taxes, you voted against it 126 times.	1
ClaimBuster	591	But I think the president, again, still hasn't shown how he's going to go about it the right way.	0
ClaimBuster	592	The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we've got to make choices.	0
ClaimBuster	593	You know what she should have done?	0
ClaimBuster	594	Then it went to the Russians and said, let's see if you can do something.	1
ClaimBuster	595	But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists.	0
ClaimBuster	596	My favorite bumper sticker, though, is: Annoy the Media.	1
ClaimBuster	597	But on Medicare, for current retirees, he's cutting $716 billion from the program.	1
ClaimBuster	598	Yes, it'll create bubble jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	599	Uh - FHA, which used to be a very responsible agency, uh - that everyone looked to to help own a home, lost six million dollars last year.	1
ClaimBuster	600	This is about, somebody said earlier, one of the first questions, we're together.	1
ClaimBuster	601	That's the kind of leadership I want to provide.	0
ClaimBuster	602	I found that was rather difficult to do.	0
ClaimBuster	603	Absolutely we can win, because it's your country.	0
ClaimBuster	604	And he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is.	1
ClaimBuster	605	Now, with regard to having to say whether we would try to survive in the event of a nuclear war, of course we would.	0
ClaimBuster	606	Government shouldn't be a heavy hand.	0
ClaimBuster	607	The man loves his family a lot, and I appreciate that, because I love my family.	1
ClaimBuster	608	You must say that if you receive money you must show us whether or not children are learning to read and write and add and subtract.	0
ClaimBuster	609	My point I have made already, Mr. President, with regard to negotiating: it does not call for nuclear superiority on the part of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	610	I want us to invest in your future.	0
ClaimBuster	611	But it can't be dismissed that easily.	0
ClaimBuster	612	Well, but -- but virtually -- virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate.	0
ClaimBuster	613	The argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty-five years.	0
ClaimBuster	614	Almost half of all the tax cut benefits, as I said under Governor Bush's plan, go to the wealthiest 1%.	1
ClaimBuster	615	We'd like to have your support.	0
ClaimBuster	616	If they can't get a loan, that means that they can't make payroll.	0
ClaimBuster	617	I want all seniors to have prescription drugs in Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	618	So I will tell you this.	0
ClaimBuster	619	And there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate like we're having tonight about health care, about energy policy, about tax policy.	1
ClaimBuster	620	We cannot be the policemen of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	621	They see ethical problems in the Whitehouse today.	0
ClaimBuster	622	But the president and his friends took it out in the House, and now you don't have that right.	1
ClaimBuster	623	We still need to cover about 20million people and a lot of children.	1
ClaimBuster	624	We spend 30% more of our income than any nation on earth on health care, and yet we insure fewer people.	1
ClaimBuster	625	Well, thank you very much, Jim, and thanks to the commission and the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, for hosting us tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	626	That's how we went after Al Qaida and bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	627	And, Senator Obama, when he said -- and he signed a piece of paper that said he would take public financing for his campaign if I did -- that was back when he was a long-shot candidate -- you didn't keep your word.	1
ClaimBuster	628	Nobody has more respect for women than I do.	0
ClaimBuster	629	And in that connection I again would say that while Senator Kennedy says we are for the status quo, I do believe that he uh - would agree that I am just as sincere in believing that my proposals for federal aid to education, my proposals for health care are just as sincerely held as his.	0
ClaimBuster	630	But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans.	1
ClaimBuster	631	Mr. Bush says it's a hunky-dory deal.	1
ClaimBuster	632	Cocaine is up 141 percent -- marijuana, cocaine up 166 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	633	But it is important that we learn about what has been effective.	0
ClaimBuster	634	When Mr. Quayle said that all the networks said, that's not true.	0
ClaimBuster	635	In each case, I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country.	0
ClaimBuster	636	Affirmative action means that you take extra steps to acknowledge the history of discrimination and injustice and prejudice and bring all people into the American dream because it helps everybody, not just those who are directly benefitting.	0
ClaimBuster	637	I said that we'd go after al-Qaeda and bin Laden, we have.	1
ClaimBuster	638	You know, this is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices.	1
ClaimBuster	639	Joe, I want to tell you, I'll not only help you buy that business that you worked your whole life for and be able -- and I'll keep your taxes low and I'll provide available and affordable health care for you and your employees.	0
ClaimBuster	640	And I'll take care of them.	0
ClaimBuster	641	But more than that, to do the kind of job that I'm elected to do, will do it with as much good humor as I can, but at the same time will do it in a way which will achieve the goals we want for ourselves and our people.	0
ClaimBuster	642	I'd like to thank all the folks around America that no one ever knows about -- the woman that was holding the AIDS baby she adopted in Cedar Rapids, Iowa who asked me to do something more for adoption; the woman who stopped along the road in Wisconsin and wept because her husband had lost his job after 27 years; all the people who are having a tough time and the people who are winning but who know how desperately we need to change.	1
ClaimBuster	643	He's in the electronics business in -- in St. Louis.	1
ClaimBuster	644	No, they were taunting us.	0
ClaimBuster	645	Senators and congressmen have a wide choice.	0
ClaimBuster	646	It basically protected states from the action of one state to another.	0
ClaimBuster	647	We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty.	0
ClaimBuster	648	Where we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	649	So I want to say that, with the Nunn-Lugar thing...	0
ClaimBuster	650	"Reminds me of the line from the movie, ""Show me the money."""	0
ClaimBuster	651	I'm very proud of that.	0
ClaimBuster	652	I don't think that's my job or my business.	0
ClaimBuster	653	For most of my time as governor a woman was my chief of staff.	1
ClaimBuster	654	We've worked hard to expand public school choice in my balanced budget bill.	0
ClaimBuster	655	The State Department has said that.	1
ClaimBuster	656	I do not believe we should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure.	0
ClaimBuster	657	There are 3.5 million more women living in poverty today than when the president took office.	1
ClaimBuster	658	... to be given any opportunities at all.	0
ClaimBuster	659	I want us to recapture that image.	0
ClaimBuster	660	That's how we cut taxes for middle- class families and small businesses.	0
ClaimBuster	661	They will know whether we used those weapons or not.	0
ClaimBuster	662	And I think that we've had enough of a record of letting -- under the guise of revolution -- someone that we thought was a little more right than we would be, letting that person go, and then winding up with totalitarianism, pure and simple, as the alternative.	0
ClaimBuster	663	Everybody knows it's hard work, because there's a determined enemy that's trying to defeat us.	0
ClaimBuster	664	I have a record of appointing judges in the State of Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	665	It holds down the prices of their goods.	1
ClaimBuster	666	I think for a while as a nation we condoned those things we should have condemned.	0
ClaimBuster	667	I talked to the American Ambassador there.	1
ClaimBuster	668	The consequences of defeat, which would result from his plan of withdrawal and according to date certain, regardless of conditions, according to our military leaders, according to every expert, would lead to defeat -- possible defeat, loss of all the fragile sacrifice that we've made of American blood and treasure, which grieves us all.	0
ClaimBuster	669	Let me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue.	0
ClaimBuster	670	And, in addition to that put forward a proposal that was adopted and used throughout my own term of office of selection of - for all judges and district attorneys or prosecuting attorneys, on the basis of merit.	1
ClaimBuster	671	I think that, obviously, she's a capable politician who has, I think, excited the -- a base in the Republican Party.	0
ClaimBuster	672	First thing I want to say is thank you for giving me the chance to be president.	0
ClaimBuster	673	I have proposed a lot of new investments to improve the quality of life for our soldiers, for our men and women in uniform, for their families, for their training.	1
ClaimBuster	674	And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	675	Let me tell you this straight from the shoulder.	0
ClaimBuster	676	It means that we are cracking down on CEOs and making sure that they're not getting bonuses or golden parachutes as a consequence of this package.	0
ClaimBuster	677	We had to stand up against a tyrant.	0
ClaimBuster	678	But you know, they were working pretty hard eight years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	679	Both parties in Washington, the president and the Congress, have cut Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	680	We do not need 4 more years of an economic theory that doesn't work.	0
ClaimBuster	681	And Barbara and I were sitting there before that Democratic convention.	1
ClaimBuster	682	And I regret to say that this administration has even blocked steps that could help us move further along.	0
ClaimBuster	683	But I think in terms of the American people's concern about my commitment, I'm here tonight, folks; I never quit supporting you as you put me on the ballot in the other 26 states; and when you asked me to come back in, I came back in.	0
ClaimBuster	684	He said that two divisions would have to report not ready for duty, and that's not what the joint chiefs say.	1
ClaimBuster	685	Again, a little bit of naivete there.	0
ClaimBuster	686	There are many people who believe that the only way we can get this country turned around is to tax the middle class more and punish them more, but the truth is that middle-class Americans are basically the only group of Americans who've been taxed more in the 1980s and during the last 12 years, even though their incomes have gone down.	1
ClaimBuster	687	And of course, a military action is the last resort.	0
ClaimBuster	688	"So if you're looking at a competitive world, you say to yourself, ""Hey, I do better overseas than I do here in America. """	0
ClaimBuster	689	This is government by stalemate, and we've seen almost a complete breakdown in the proper relationship between the president, who represents this country, and the Congress, who collectively also represent this country.	0
ClaimBuster	690	We have the greatest people on Earth in our military.	0
ClaimBuster	691	On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that we've got to boost American energy production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than they've been in years.	1
ClaimBuster	692	What I was referring to, of course, in the comment that you referred to was the situation in Lebanon.	0
ClaimBuster	693	50 million of you won't receive it.	1
ClaimBuster	694	We're expanding our homestead uh - housing program.	0
ClaimBuster	695	Saudi Arabia, nothing but money.	0
ClaimBuster	696	And we knew where the fuel rods were.	1
ClaimBuster	697	Then we would present a plan to control health care costs and phase in health care coverage for all Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	698	Before I campaigned as a Democrat for a Republican candidate for President, I had already voted for Dwight Eisenhower to be President of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	699	The last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs.	1
ClaimBuster	700	So I just want to try to correct it as we go along.	0
ClaimBuster	701	We offered an amendment to do so.	1
ClaimBuster	702	As president, I will make certain we travel it.	0
ClaimBuster	703	It requires a different kind of leadership style to do it, though.	0
ClaimBuster	704	I want to lower your cost to health care.	0
ClaimBuster	705	Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods.	0
ClaimBuster	706	It's one thing to be certain, but you can be certain and be wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	707	That's what the Duelfer report showed.	1
ClaimBuster	708	This makes it almost impossible for us to have a good health program.	0
ClaimBuster	709	I don't think it's fair to say, you know, whatever it is, that if you haven't been hit by it personally.	0
ClaimBuster	710	That doesn't mean we shouldn't fully enforce laws and fully protect people and fully honor people, which I will do as the President of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	711	The Iranians have a lousy government, so therefore their economy is lousy, even though they have significant oil revenues.	0
ClaimBuster	712	Thirdly, in Bosnia it's a virtual miracle that there has been no return to war and at least there has now been an election.	1
ClaimBuster	713	And it's a personal and private, moral judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	714	You can say you do to the cameras but you don't, unless you've changed your plan here on the stage.	0
ClaimBuster	715	I commend it to anybody.	0
ClaimBuster	716	In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.	1
ClaimBuster	717	It's important for the nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	718	I believe in a sensible arms control approach that brings down these weapons to manageable levels.	0
ClaimBuster	719	We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.	0
ClaimBuster	720	You can also use those accounts for health care or education or a first home.	1
ClaimBuster	721	If you're from Washington, you want to pick and choose winners.	0
ClaimBuster	722	But it's not going to solve the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	723	Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things -- WikiLeaks that just came out.	1
ClaimBuster	724	I see my time is running out here.	0
ClaimBuster	725	In my speech last night I indicated that I thought that Cuba one day again would be free.	1
ClaimBuster	726	And I can't tell you what it means to me at these rallies when I see you and you come up and the look in your eyes -- and I know how you feel and you know how I feel.	0
ClaimBuster	727	The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody.	1
ClaimBuster	728	We uh - streamlined the structure of the court, put in administrative officers, put a unified court system in, required that all uh - severe sentences be reviewed far uniformity.	0
ClaimBuster	729	And I think that's one reason why we need fresh leadership in the White House that can make progress now in bringing peace to the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	730	And for that to happen, we have to strengthen our economy here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	731	And the point is that we become energy independent and we will create millions of jobs -- millions of jobs in America.	0
ClaimBuster	732	You were very much involved -- excuse me.	0
ClaimBuster	733	How would he feel about it?	0
ClaimBuster	734	I mean, you have said before you'd cut the deficit in half.	1
ClaimBuster	735	Well, we're going to be finished by 2014, and when I'm president, we'll make sure we bring our troops out by the end of 2014.	0
ClaimBuster	736	I mean, the fact is that there -- even though no state wants them, there are guns in some schools.	0
ClaimBuster	737	Will you finally touch that defense budget?	0
ClaimBuster	738	I have a plan to cover all children.	0
ClaimBuster	739	We'll have a debate in 4 days and we can talk about this character thing again.	1
ClaimBuster	740	Most small businesses -- 70 percent of the new jobs in America are created by small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	741	Congress has sustained forty-two vetoes.	1
ClaimBuster	742	But I am determined that if ever our men are called on, they should have the best that we can provide in the manner of tools and weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	743	We'll pass on the American dream to our children, and I will not leave our children a situation that they have today.	0
ClaimBuster	744	In fact, in my ten-year budget proposal I've set aside more than twice as much for this purpose as Governor Bush has in his proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	745	I think we have to demonstrate some flexibility and I think the FDA is attempting to do so now in trying to make it possible for new and experimental drugs to be available to people who are at risk at AIDS and I would hope that we could bring that kind of a policy to bear beginning in January.	1
ClaimBuster	746	But I think even more relevant is my record at home.	0
ClaimBuster	747	That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.	1
ClaimBuster	748	I think you should vote for Mr. Nixon.	0
ClaimBuster	749	But when you look -- and Chicago's not the only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places.	0
ClaimBuster	750	And the prosecutions are up by about 68 percent -- I believe -- is the number.	1
ClaimBuster	751	And these old boys are not going to quit easy.	0
ClaimBuster	752	The issue of nationalism - the recognition, he says, that every major problem confronting us is global, and cannot be solved by nationalism here or elsewhere - that is chauvinistic, that is parochial, that is as anachronistic as states' rights was in the days of Jefferson Davis.	1
ClaimBuster	753	And as I just told you, there's going to be a summit of the Arab nations.	1
ClaimBuster	754	They're created in the private sector.	1
ClaimBuster	755	And the way I pay for it -- I'm not fiscally irresponsible -- is I roll back the tax cut this president so fiercely wants to defend, the one for him and me and Charlie.	1
ClaimBuster	756	Andrea, why do people who want balanced budgets or to bring the deficit down always go to those programs which tend to benefit people of very modest means?	0
ClaimBuster	757	"I was hunting in Iowa last year with a sheriff from one of the counties there, and he pointed to a house in back of us, and said, ""See the house over?"	1
ClaimBuster	758	You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way.	0
ClaimBuster	759	And today, you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what Republicanism represents in this country today.	0
ClaimBuster	760	And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch-and-go situation.	1
ClaimBuster	761	I have three very special people with me tonight: My wife, Elizabeth; my daughter, Robin, who has never let me down, and a fellow named Frank Carafa from New York, along with Ollie Manninen who helped me out in the mountains of Italy a few years back.	1
ClaimBuster	762	Go home and look in the mirror.	0
ClaimBuster	763	I'm glad you raised that, and it's a -- it's a critical issue.	0
ClaimBuster	764	We've not only kept peace for our own country, but we've been able to extend the benefits of peace to others.	0
ClaimBuster	765	And you have to make decisions even when it's against your own interest.	0
ClaimBuster	766	They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else.	0
ClaimBuster	767	Firehouses don't have enough firefighters in them.	0
ClaimBuster	768	I would support the Orrin Hatch version of it, not the Senator Kennedy version.	0
ClaimBuster	769	I've kept that promise and if you'll vote for me, then I promise I'll fight just as hard in a second term.	0
ClaimBuster	770	You ask the Strunks whose plan makes more sense.	0
ClaimBuster	771	And that's why the Congress, including the Republicans, have not gone along with the President's recommendations.	1
ClaimBuster	772	We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable.	0
ClaimBuster	773	I have a fearless forecast.	0
ClaimBuster	774	And the reason is because of its people, because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that she's gotten; because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn't lay off workers during a recession.	1
ClaimBuster	775	The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board should be independent.	0
ClaimBuster	776	If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it's like a national catastrophe.	0
ClaimBuster	777	I indicated under oath that the initiative that I took was at the request of the ranking members of the House Banking and Currency Committee on the Republican side, which was a legitimate request and a proper response by me.	1
ClaimBuster	778	I don't think we need them to remain strong.	0
ClaimBuster	779	It recognizes that the government has a responsibility to get the farmer out of the trouble he presently is in because the government got him into it.	0
ClaimBuster	780	This was an effort that was made by the attorney general and myself, working with the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	781	But you know, Lloyd Bentsen jumped on Dan Quayle, when Dan Quayle said, he's had roughly the same amount of experience.	1
ClaimBuster	782	"If the president had shown the patience to go through another round of resolution, to sit down with those leaders, say, ""What do you need, what do you need now, how much more will it take to get you to join us?"""	0
ClaimBuster	783	We also have to see that all of the people of the United States - the tremendous talents that our people have - are used adequately.	0
ClaimBuster	784	You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	785	The only reason it's not happening is because Governor Romney's allies in Congress have held the 98 percent hostage because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	786	Fifty percent of small business income taxes are paid by small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	787	I ask everybody to look at my economic ideas and 9 Nobel prize winners and over 500 economists and hundreds of business people, including a lot of Republicans said, this is the way you've got to go.	1
ClaimBuster	788	If we fail, then freedom fails.	0
ClaimBuster	789	But I think this is indicative of what I would do.	0
ClaimBuster	790	I think they've engaged in an evil behavior and I think that it is important that we understand they're not the old Soviet Union but they still have nationalist impulses that I think are very dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	791	I'll tell you what kind of judges he'll put on.	0
ClaimBuster	792	And in the process, as a result of that will and that decision and that toughness, we now have ancient enemies talking peace in the Middle East.	1
ClaimBuster	793	But 11 million new jobs and everything, I mean the President can't take credit for everything that governors are doing, whether that's happening in New York City when it comes to the murder rate and then not be responsible for the bad things that happen, whether it's drug use or something else in America.	0
ClaimBuster	794	This is not enough; it should be more.	0
ClaimBuster	795	The whole th- the United States now has a treaty - which I voted for in the United States Senate in 1955 - to defend Formosa and the Pescadores Island.	1
ClaimBuster	796	And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse.	0
ClaimBuster	797	We've spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	798	I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	799	But now we need both that kind of discipline and the resources and the consistent leadership that allows this country to catch up in education and science and training.	0
ClaimBuster	800	That's another way to improve the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	801	I learned how to get along on the other side of the aisle.	0
ClaimBuster	802	It's the private sector that creates jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	803	You know, I wasn't going to say this at all, but I can't help it.	0
ClaimBuster	804	I don't want American workers subsidizing the loss of their own job.	0
ClaimBuster	805	And we can do it again, if we take politics out of it.	0
ClaimBuster	806	We live in a world where what you earn depends on what you can learn, where the average 18- year-old will change jobs 8 times in a lifetime and where none of us can promise any of you that what you now do for a living is absolutely safe from now on.	1
ClaimBuster	807	And I am going to keep that Social Security Trust Fund sound and keep our commitment to the elderly and maybe down the line, maybe when you get two decades or one into the next century, you're going to have to take another look at it, but not now.	0
ClaimBuster	808	His whole deal is you've gotta be for it or against it, you can't make it better.	0
ClaimBuster	809	But I don't know Putin.	1
ClaimBuster	810	The role of government: Look behind us.	0
ClaimBuster	811	$89 billion last year to the top 1 percent of Americans, but kids lost their after-school programs.	1
ClaimBuster	812	And so we said: Let's raise the standards.	1
ClaimBuster	813	Secondly, we got upset when he took the whole thing, but to the ordinary American out there who doesn't know where the oil fields are in Kuwait, they're near the border.	1
ClaimBuster	814	Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world.	1
ClaimBuster	815	But I went anyway because I knew if I didn't, somebody else in the small town of Carthage, Tennessee, would have to go in my place.	0
ClaimBuster	816	They should have been doing this for years.	0
ClaimBuster	817	Well, it's in this committee or it's got this sponsor.	0
ClaimBuster	818	Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady Bill.	1
ClaimBuster	819	And recently the Federal Trade Commission pointed out that some of these entertainment companies have warned parents that the material is inappropriate for children, and then they've turned around behind the backs of the parents and advertised that same adult material directly to children.	1
ClaimBuster	820	And again I know Senator D'Amato I think may have had a hearing or two on Whitewater, I can't remember, but he's not my general chairman, he's a friend of mine.	1
ClaimBuster	821	I've broken up organized crime.	1
ClaimBuster	822	I can see why people at your workplace think he changes positions a lot, because he does.	1
ClaimBuster	823	We will commit more over time to help.	0
ClaimBuster	824	Why don't you interrupt her?	0
ClaimBuster	825	We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if it's attacked.	1
ClaimBuster	826	I believe that choice is a woman's choice.	0
ClaimBuster	827	But if you take it in percentages, then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board.	0
ClaimBuster	828	If we make the use of a gun in the commission.	0
ClaimBuster	829	I think it's the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down.	0
ClaimBuster	830	I think it's very difficult.	0
ClaimBuster	831	And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.	1
ClaimBuster	832	It shouldn't happen in America.	0
ClaimBuster	833	We all assume that the tax cuts will be permanent.	0
ClaimBuster	834	And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn't take donors.	1
ClaimBuster	835	For twenty-five years I served in the Congress under five presidents.	1
ClaimBuster	836	When we talk about child care, and the credits that we're providing.	0
ClaimBuster	837	And I think this is something the American people see.	0
ClaimBuster	838	We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect.	0
ClaimBuster	839	The administration brought a criminal action against the people drilling up there for oil, this massive new resource we have.	1
ClaimBuster	840	And we've got a good strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	841	And I believe that we used our skill.	0
ClaimBuster	842	The auto worker in Toledo who was unemployed when I was elected and now has a great job because we're number one in auto production again.	1
ClaimBuster	843	And Congress could have done that if the budget committees of the Congress, and the Congress as a whole, had not increased the spending that I recommended in the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	844	But had it been done, it's possible we could have avoided the issue.	0
ClaimBuster	845	I was opposing one piece of legislation versus another.	1
ClaimBuster	846	He has consistently denied what is...	1
ClaimBuster	847	Our policemen and women are disrespected.	0
ClaimBuster	848	I think of Dr. Fauci.	0
ClaimBuster	849	Well, I had thought that there was a controversy at the end of the legislative session where the hate crimes law in Texas was -- failed, and that the Byrd family, among others, asked you to support it, Governor, and it died in committee for lack of support.	0
ClaimBuster	850	"I tell the people on the campaign trail, when I asked Laura to marry me, she said, ""Fine, just so long as I never have to give a speech."	1
ClaimBuster	851	Senator McCain and I actually agree on something.	1
ClaimBuster	852	You can keep your choice of doctor.	0
ClaimBuster	853	It's time to have a leader that doesn't put off tomorrow what we should do today.	0
ClaimBuster	854	How's it going to affect my house?	0
ClaimBuster	855	In his first year, I was just getting -- licking my wounds from having been beaten by John McCain, all right.	0
ClaimBuster	856	Obamacare is a total disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	857	So this is who Donald Trump is.	0
ClaimBuster	858	I would be writing a letter to people who know everything there is to know about us.	0
ClaimBuster	859	I think under presidents For- uh - Nixon and Eisenhower they passed about 60 to 75 percent of their legislation.	1
ClaimBuster	860	And free and fair trade is the answer, not protection.	0
ClaimBuster	861	They have to understand we want to trade with them.	0
ClaimBuster	862	And Democrats and Republicans alike, I think, acknowledge his expertise there.	0
ClaimBuster	863	Oil production is up, natural gas production is up, and, most importantly, we're also starting to build cars that are more efficient.	1
ClaimBuster	864	Iraq was Iran's mortal enemy.	1
ClaimBuster	865	And in this election, America has to make an important choice.	1
ClaimBuster	866	But because we had no allies and because it was very unclear that we could actually accomplish what we would want to accomplish about putting military forces there, I think it was the right thing not to jump in, as heartbreaking as it was, but I think we should have come in much quicker with the humanitarian mission.	0
ClaimBuster	867	I think that it's been very well...	0
ClaimBuster	868	But first of all, this is a nation of immigrants.	1
ClaimBuster	869	So what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support.	0
ClaimBuster	870	We need to do more.	0
ClaimBuster	871	And I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice.	0
ClaimBuster	872	My wife is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister.	1
ClaimBuster	873	Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name.	0
ClaimBuster	874	Remember when people almost used to walk across the street rather than have a contact with somebody who was in Vietnam?	0
ClaimBuster	875	It's because they have lost their industry.	0
ClaimBuster	876	It is going to cause scarcity in world markets because there are at least five reputable studies, one even by the American Petroleum Institute itself, that, I think, clearly indicate that somewhere along around the end of the present decade, total world demand for oil is simply going to exceed total available supplies.	1
ClaimBuster	877	You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you.	1
ClaimBuster	878	And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	879	And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she's for it.	1
ClaimBuster	880	My father was a small-businessman.	1
ClaimBuster	881	And if they don't do it, we're gonna ask for tougher authority in the hands of the FTC on the false and deceptive advertising.	0
ClaimBuster	882	I mean, I had a friend who said you don't just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, all right?	0
ClaimBuster	883	We sent it to the Clinton Administration for implementation, and they waited three and a half years.	1
ClaimBuster	884	"""I think that makes sense."	0
ClaimBuster	885	And that's, like, no growth.	0
ClaimBuster	886	For the last eight years I've served on the National Security Council, and when the conflict came up in Bosnia, I saw a genocide in the heart of Europe with the most violent war on the continent of Europe since World War II.	1
ClaimBuster	887	What kind of judgment sense has your chief education adviser now in jail in Massachusetts?	0
ClaimBuster	888	And I have every right in the world to defend my record and positions.	0
ClaimBuster	889	And it is one of the things I've learned in the White House, is that there's enormous pressure on the president, and he cannot wilt under that pressure.	0
ClaimBuster	890	We're getting ready to dismantle the airlines industry in our country, and none of you know it.	1
ClaimBuster	891	She's got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	892	If there's more time for gridlock and talk and finger pointing, I'm the wrong man.	0
ClaimBuster	893	I don't go along with it.	0
ClaimBuster	894	And if the Congress won't do it, if they can't get together and negotiate how to do that, then you'd have a sequester across the board.	0
ClaimBuster	895	The rest of the world practices 21st century capitalism.	0
ClaimBuster	896	Now, they look at us and say, Is it a good idea to be with America?	0
ClaimBuster	897	Sorry, time for diplomacy is over.	0
ClaimBuster	898	Let's take Mr. Bush for the moment at his word -- he's right, we don't have any evidence at least that our government did tell Saddam Hussein he could have that part of Kuwait.	1
ClaimBuster	899	As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people.	1
ClaimBuster	900	And we have -- look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me.	1
ClaimBuster	901	We want a world that's stable.	0
ClaimBuster	902	The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul.	0
ClaimBuster	903	But it's also tremendously important to bear in mind that when you pour in money without pouring in technical assistance at w- as well, that you have a disastrous situation.	0
ClaimBuster	904	What has happened to you?	0
ClaimBuster	905	We initiated a very fine urban renewal program, working with the mayors, the governors, and other interested officials.	0
ClaimBuster	906	It is a commitment that we have to meet if we're going to protect the security of Western Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	907	Spain is a NATO ally.	1
ClaimBuster	908	That includes oil; it includes all kinds of minerals; it includes everything within the range of taxation.	0
ClaimBuster	909	Now, it is absolutely true that we cannot just meet these challenges militarily.	0
ClaimBuster	910	But I believe America is the greatest country in human history because we have maintained freedom and increasing prosperity by relentlessly pushing the barriers of knowledge, the barriers of the present, always moving into the future.	0
ClaimBuster	911	Let me say again, there is no more important responsibility for the president than to say if you believe in the constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence, that's all we need to know.	0
ClaimBuster	912	And his forecast for the next four years is more deficits, almost that large.	1
ClaimBuster	913	They would not have materialized for about nine to eighteen months.	0
ClaimBuster	914	So, I would say somebody in the format of uh - Justice Stevens would be the kind of an individual that I would uh - select in the future, as I did him in the past.	0
ClaimBuster	915	He made it illegal, illegal for Medicare to do what the V.A.	1
ClaimBuster	916	I can remember being in upstate New York talking to FBI agents that helped bust a Lackawanna cell up there.	0
ClaimBuster	917	But when Joe McCarthy went around this country attacking people's patriotism he was wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	918	We both believe that, as lawyers -- I'm a lawyer, too.	0
ClaimBuster	919	And as a consequence, you had 46 states around the country who have made a real difference.	1
ClaimBuster	920	We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.	0
ClaimBuster	921	And not only did she interest me, I guess you would say it was love at first sight.	0
ClaimBuster	922	One is to reduce spending -- controlling that mandatory spending.	0
ClaimBuster	923	Ours are permanent, ours is a good plan.	0
ClaimBuster	924	Senator Obama's name was not on that letter.	1
ClaimBuster	925	We do have a serious problem in our culture.	0
ClaimBuster	926	I talk to small businesses across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	927	So far, Mr. Ford has not responded.	1
ClaimBuster	928	But I hope the next Administration - and if I have anything to do with it, the next Administration will - make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing, control of nuclear weapons, if possible, control of outer space, free from weapons, and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels.	0
ClaimBuster	929	I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.	0
ClaimBuster	930	We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration.	0
ClaimBuster	931	I know one thing about the position of president, it's the only position in our Constitution that is filled by an individual who is given the responsibility to fight not just for one state or one district or the well-connected or wealthy, but to fight for all of the people, including especially those who most need somebody who will stand up and take on whatever powerful forces might stand in the way.	0
ClaimBuster	932	This is a formidable force.	0
ClaimBuster	933	We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy.	1
ClaimBuster	934	"'', he said, ""Cut those things I asked for but didn't get.''"	1
ClaimBuster	935	See, an educated child is one much more likely to be hopeful and optimistic.	0
ClaimBuster	936	President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan.	1
ClaimBuster	937	I would like to thank Governor Bush for participating, and I would like to say I'm happy to be here with Tipper and our family.	0
ClaimBuster	938	I would oppose that, but I think were on the right track in agriculture and I am very very encouraged.	0
ClaimBuster	939	I want small businesses -- and by the way, the small businesses that we're talking about would receive an increase in their taxes right now.	1
ClaimBuster	940	Thirdly, I don't believe that the government contracts division is operated with vigor.	0
ClaimBuster	941	The plan says we'll train Iraqi soldiers so they can do the hard work, and we are.	1
ClaimBuster	942	And eliminated probably more quickly than our plan, but we wanted to be so conservative with it, that people would see how.	0
ClaimBuster	943	Thank you for doing what you're doing.	0
ClaimBuster	944	I have participated in the discussions leading to the decisions in this Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	945	But one mistake he's made is fuel efficiency standards at 40 to 45 miles a gallon will throw many auto workers out of work, and you can't have it both ways.	1
ClaimBuster	946	This is another example of misplaced priorities.	0
ClaimBuster	947	And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front -- that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan.	1
ClaimBuster	948	Number two, trade -- I'll crack down on China, President Bush didn't.	1
ClaimBuster	949	But you were in contact -- excuse me.	0
ClaimBuster	950	Now, I think I have to let Senator Dole speak for himself.	0
ClaimBuster	951	I'm optimistic we'll achieve -- I know we won't achieve if we send mixed signals.	0
ClaimBuster	952	And so I would say that the concept of the Dukakis family has my great respect.	0
ClaimBuster	953	Secondly, what's he going to do to provide fair employment?	0
ClaimBuster	954	That way we can invest in the research and technology that's always kept us at the cutting edge.	0
ClaimBuster	955	We have to be firm and strong.	0
ClaimBuster	956	Productivity in the first half of 1980 was down a minus 2 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	957	No, it doesn't speak for itself, Mr. Vice President, it speaks for the fact that there are certain rules in this that we all agree to, but evidently rules don't mean anything.	0
ClaimBuster	958	Now, this is the most dangerous technology that we possess.	0
ClaimBuster	959	Thirdly, we ought to have boot camps for first-time nonviolent offenders so they can get discipline and treatment and education and get reconnected to the community before they're severed and sent to prison, where they can learn how to be first class criminals.	0
ClaimBuster	960	I think it is exports that have saved us when we're in a global slowdown, a connected global slowdown, a recession in some countries.	0
ClaimBuster	961	You can't have a free market work if you don't have regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	962	I think the real issue in this campaign, and that which you must decide on November second, is whether you should vote for his promise or my performance in two years in the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	963	I believe there's fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system.	0
ClaimBuster	964	Senator Richard Lugar, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that the handling of the reconstruction aid in Iraq by this administration has been incompetent.	1
ClaimBuster	965	We'll continue to build our alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	966	So one of the things that I have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing.	1
ClaimBuster	967	Well, you know, let me just...	0
ClaimBuster	968	He's trying to attack me.	1
ClaimBuster	969	That has the benefit of making sure our employers aren't breaking the law as they try to fill their workforce needs.	0
ClaimBuster	970	We've got to invest in science and technology.	0
ClaimBuster	971	The farmers are not the victims of anything this administration has done.	1
ClaimBuster	972	So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down.	0
ClaimBuster	973	It is the best anti-terrorist report written.	0
ClaimBuster	974	We have serious differences with the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	975	And that's not how a commander in chief acts.	0
ClaimBuster	976	And I supported this bill.	1
ClaimBuster	977	Now, Mr. Hankins, I think that the situation that you describe has gotten completely out of hand.	0
ClaimBuster	978	They're tough negotiators, but all previous Presidents have made progress.	1
ClaimBuster	979	And looking around here, at this group here, I suspect there are only three people here who are going to be affected: the president, me, and, Charlie, I'm sorry, you too.	0
ClaimBuster	980	He changes positions on something as fundamental as what you believe in your core, in your heart of hearts, is right in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	981	Did you ask me a question?	0
ClaimBuster	982	Can I respond to that?	0
ClaimBuster	983	I will bring our energy companies back.	0
ClaimBuster	984	But we faced it and we did it, and we believe it's fair, shared sacrifice.	0
ClaimBuster	985	The reason Indochina was preserved was the result of the Geneva Conference which Indochina.	1
ClaimBuster	986	Well, that's not exactly an accurate description of what happened.	0
ClaimBuster	987	They investigated every single one of my children.	1
ClaimBuster	988	Every time our interest rates go up one percent, that adds 28 billion dollars to the deficit or to the debt.	1
ClaimBuster	989	But I'm confident, now that General Petraeus is in the new position of command, that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops -- and, by the way, there have been 20,000 additional troops, from 32,000 to 53,000, and there needs to be more.	1
ClaimBuster	990	And that's an example of the kind of advocacy that we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family.	0
ClaimBuster	991	If people don't have the stomach to fix these problems, I think it's a good time to face it, November.	0
ClaimBuster	992	The second thing is this all assumes that the Soviets wouldn't respond in kind.	0
ClaimBuster	993	I can't think of any.	0
ClaimBuster	994	So how do we deal with it?	0
ClaimBuster	995	I believe college tuition up to $10,000 per year ought to be tax deductible so middle-class families can choose to send their children to college.	0
ClaimBuster	996	The enemy understands a free Iraq will be a major defeat in their ideology of hatred.	0
ClaimBuster	997	One of the things that happens when you're a governor, at least oftentimes you have to make tough decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	998	And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right.	1
ClaimBuster	999	Number two, with regards to Iran and the threat of Iran, there's no question but that a nuclear Iran, a nuclear-capable Iran is unacceptable to America.	0
ClaimBuster	1000	And it's referred to as an assault weapon ban, but it had, at the signing of the bill, both the pro-gun and the anti-gun people came together, because it provided opportunities for both that both wanted.	1
ClaimBuster	1001	We have a long distance yet to travel in terms of fairness in America.	0
ClaimBuster	1002	We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20-25 billion a year, which is what we've been doing under this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	1003	I want to make sure that it stays in that relationship.	0
ClaimBuster	1004	Humvees -- 10,000 out of 12,000 Humvees that are over there aren't armored.	1
ClaimBuster	1005	In other states, we've done it.	1
ClaimBuster	1006	We have a separate and unequal school system in the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	1007	The -- I haven't seen that, in my commercials?	0
ClaimBuster	1008	I don't think they ought to have special rights, but I think they ought to have the same rights.	0
ClaimBuster	1009	That's why we doubled clean -- clean energy production like wind and solar and biofuels.	1
ClaimBuster	1010	How many of you like it?	0
ClaimBuster	1011	Some people say that's a hatchet.	0
ClaimBuster	1012	You know, my hardest -- the hardest part of the job is to know that I committed the troops in harm's way and then do the best I can to provide comfort for the loved ones who lost a son or a daughter or a husband or wife.	1
ClaimBuster	1013	You see, I don't think we need to tax more and spend more, and then say that's going to make the problem better.	0
ClaimBuster	1014	As a matter of fact, it's growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement.	1
ClaimBuster	1015	It also defined marriage as between a man and woman.	1
ClaimBuster	1016	"And as President Kennedy said when he ran for president, he said, ""I'm not running to be a Catholic president."	1
ClaimBuster	1017	Here a very small investment of taxpayer's money - in the housing field can bring large numbers of extra jobs, and the guarantee of mortgage loans, and the uh - putting forward of uh - two-0-two programs for housing for older people and so forth to cut down the roughly 20 percent unemployment that now exists in the - in the construction industry.	1
ClaimBuster	1018	But short of the constitutional amendment, and within the confines of the Supreme Court rulings, I'll do everything I can to minimize the need for abortions with better sex education, family planning, with better adoptive procedures.	0
ClaimBuster	1019	And everybody knows, including the Wall Street Journal, hardly a friend of the Democratic party of this administration, that the '82 tax increase he sponsored in inflation-adjusted dollars was the biggest tax increase in American history.	1
ClaimBuster	1020	But we know we've got lots of work to do.	0
ClaimBuster	1021	We got intimately involved in building NATO and other structures there.	1
ClaimBuster	1022	But let's not cut into the muscle, and let's not cut down our insurance policy, which is participation of American forces in NATO, the greatest peace- keeping organization ever made.	1
ClaimBuster	1023	So I would think we can expedite the problem there.	0
ClaimBuster	1024	It's now over $10 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	1025	And that's where we're going right now unless we finally get off this spending and borrowing binge.	0
ClaimBuster	1026	The key is job training, education, investments in health care and education, environment, retirement security.	0
ClaimBuster	1027	And a lot of you I think are worried about your jobs, your pensions, your retirement accounts, your ability to send your child or your grandchild to college.	0
ClaimBuster	1028	And I think if we want to continue -- as I do -- to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it.	0
ClaimBuster	1029	Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift.	0
ClaimBuster	1030	We allow you -- if you choose to, you don't have to -- but we give you broader competition to allow you to buy into the same health care plan that senators and congressmen give themselves.	1
ClaimBuster	1031	And it's going to be hard, it's going to be important to rebuild that coalition to keep the pressure on him.	0
ClaimBuster	1032	The President didn't have much to do about it.	0
ClaimBuster	1033	But here's what I do know.	0
ClaimBuster	1034	Mr. Dulles has suggested it's from two to three times as great as ours.	1
ClaimBuster	1035	The program - the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon-Javits program - would have cost, if fully used uh - six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state.	1
ClaimBuster	1036	They look at America's commitments around the world and they see what's happening, and they say, well, OK. Is America going to be strong?	0
ClaimBuster	1037	That's not the position he's taking.	1
ClaimBuster	1038	There's a special protocol recently been passed that allows for inspections.	1
ClaimBuster	1039	We've looked at your tax proposals.	0
ClaimBuster	1040	All three you mentioned are compelling national security requirements.	0
ClaimBuster	1041	You keep your own insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	1042	And I look forward to discussing exactly how we're going to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	1043	They'll make things happen to create jobs here in the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	1044	I'm not going to ask them.	0
ClaimBuster	1045	I visited a Chrysler dealership in Tokyo.	1
ClaimBuster	1046	You don't see Margaret Tutwiler sitting in there with me today.	1
ClaimBuster	1047	Six increases in the payroll tax -- that means people with incomes of $51,000 a year or less pay a disproportionally high share of the federal tax burden, which is why I want some middle-class tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	1048	And women have respect for me.	0
ClaimBuster	1049	I have a great company.	0
ClaimBuster	1050	We - uh believe that uh you can revise the federal criminal code, which has not been revised in a good many years.	1
ClaimBuster	1051	We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.	0
ClaimBuster	1052	I believe that public service is honorable.	0
ClaimBuster	1053	He has a 15-year-old daughter named Caley, who is in Sarasota High School.	1
ClaimBuster	1054	They do all the spending, they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime.	0
ClaimBuster	1055	And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	1056	It's about Kipp Academy in Houston, Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	1057	"That's why the slogan of my campaign is ""Stronger Together,"" because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals -- and I've set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else."	0
ClaimBuster	1058	That's part of what took us from deficits to surplus.	1
ClaimBuster	1059	Well, I think when I think of heroes, I think back, not presently, Ann.	0
ClaimBuster	1060	I believe that -- I believe I made a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	1061	Well, I certainly hope not.	0
ClaimBuster	1062	And we're going to put our laboratories and our colleges and our universities to work.	0
ClaimBuster	1063	We have more at stake in space satellites than they do.	0
ClaimBuster	1064	And yet the president who talks about No Child Left Behind refused to fully fund -- by $28 billion -- that particular program so you can make a difference in the lives of those young people.	1
ClaimBuster	1065	And I've done everything I could in my public life to overcome racial divisions.	0
ClaimBuster	1066	They've taken over the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	1067	"And we ought to go back to a little bit of Ronald Reagan's ""trust, but verify,"" and certainly not sit down across the table from -- without precondition, as Senator Obama said he did twice, I mean, it's just dangerous."	1
ClaimBuster	1068	... withdrawal would be dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	1069	Our diplomatic isolation needs to be tougher.	0
ClaimBuster	1070	That's what I'm all about.	0
ClaimBuster	1071	Now here's what we need to do.	0
ClaimBuster	1072	I do not mean by that that one party is a war party and the other party is a peace party.	0
ClaimBuster	1073	And we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago, Chris.	0
ClaimBuster	1074	Are we better off when we deemphasize our values in human rights?	0
ClaimBuster	1075	Make the Soviets pay for their irresponsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	1076	I believe America's best days are ahead of us because I believe that the future belongs to freedom, not to fear.	0
ClaimBuster	1077	This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country, where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies.	1
ClaimBuster	1078	But at the same time, if you want to get off Medicare, get back in the mainstream, we're going to provide jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	1079	I believe in free trade.	0
ClaimBuster	1080	I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars.	0
ClaimBuster	1081	This is a difficult and sensitive matter.	0
ClaimBuster	1082	There are several issues in which, frankly, Joe Biden and I openly and honestly disagreed on national security policy, and he's been wrong on a number of the major ones.	1
ClaimBuster	1083	It was a committee chaired by the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a Democrat.	1
ClaimBuster	1084	And the United States will maintain our national security interest in the Panama Canal.	0
ClaimBuster	1085	We have five treaties with Latin America, including the one setting up the Organization of American States in Bogota in 1948, in which we have agreed not to intervene in the internal affairs of any other American country - and they as well have agreed to do likewise.	1
ClaimBuster	1086	And I think it's been unfortunate, but it's happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top.	1
ClaimBuster	1087	And as a private citizen, believe me, you are looked on as a major nuisance.	0
ClaimBuster	1088	In 1992, before I became President, the Congress passed the Cuba Democracy Act and I enforced it vigorously.	1
ClaimBuster	1089	Well, a lot of what this campaign is about, it seems to me Bernie, goes to the question of values.	0
ClaimBuster	1090	When you cut capital gains, you put people to work.	0
ClaimBuster	1091	Jim, thank you very much.	0
ClaimBuster	1092	Because it isn't a question of how much the federal government spends; it isn't a question of which government does the most.	0
ClaimBuster	1093	He has all the conspiracy theories...	0
ClaimBuster	1094	People listening out there know the benefits of the tax cuts we passed.	0
ClaimBuster	1095	I just cited an example of the administration just unilaterally acting without any input.	1
ClaimBuster	1096	"But to somehow say that group of young women who said ""Military wives for McCain"" are somehow saying anything derogatory about you, but anything -- and those veterans that wear those hats that say ""World War II, Vietnam, Korea, Iraq,"" I'm not going to stand for people saying that the people that come to my rallies are anything but the most dedicated, patriotic men and women that are in this nation and they're great citizens."	0
ClaimBuster	1097	Whether that helps or not, I don't know.	0
ClaimBuster	1098	Not at all, Mr. Trewhitt, and I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	1099	But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked.	0
ClaimBuster	1100	And I think it's a disgrace that so far Mr. Ford's administration has blocked the passage of legislation that would've revealed by law every instance of the boycott and it would've prevented the boycott from continuing.	1
ClaimBuster	1101	You had a whole bunch of oil companies who had leases on public lands that they weren't using.	1
ClaimBuster	1102	And then I thought to myself, what are they going to say about us, what are those people 100 years from now going to think?	0
ClaimBuster	1103	High tech executives in Northern California.	1
ClaimBuster	1104	See, there's a lot I don't understand.	0
ClaimBuster	1105	I would like to mention that a couple days ago Senator Obama was out in Ohio and he had an encounter with a guy who's a plumber, his name is Joe Wurzelbacher.	1
ClaimBuster	1106	But government mandates I -- I'm always a little nervous about.	0
ClaimBuster	1107	So let's come back to harsh reality, and what I -- you know, everybody says, gee, Perot, you're tough.	0
ClaimBuster	1108	And so he would be doing exactly the wrong thing.	0
ClaimBuster	1109	There may be some other statute that was already on the books, but certainly the advocates of the hate crimes law felt that a tough new law was needed.	0
ClaimBuster	1110	I don't think I'd have to go against that pledge.	0
ClaimBuster	1111	But it started for me in the last eight years when I had the honor of casting the tie-breaking vote to end the old economic plan here at home and put into place a new economic plan that has helped us to make some progress, 22 million new jobs, the greatest prosperity ever.	1
ClaimBuster	1112	"But I am not going to pick out one and, in advance, hypothetically say, ""Oh, yes, we would send troops there.''"	0
ClaimBuster	1113	But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion.	1
ClaimBuster	1114	"I mean, this is the president who said ""There were weapons of mass destruction,"" said ""Mission accomplished,"" said we could fight the war on the cheap -- none of which were true."	1
ClaimBuster	1115	And if he should ever become uh - the president of the United States, with his vast experience as member the House and a member of the Senate, as well as a vice president, I think he would do an outstanding job as president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	1116	We have to double the size of the Afghan army.	0
ClaimBuster	1117	In the last two years, we have restored integrity in the White House, and we've set high standards in the executive branch of the government.	0
ClaimBuster	1118	A promise made will be a promise kept should I be fortunate enough to become your president.	0
ClaimBuster	1119	And if you watch it Thursday, Friday, Saturday this week, you'll get more.	0
ClaimBuster	1120	"His main strategy during the Republican primary was to say, ""We're going to encourage self-deportation."""	1
ClaimBuster	1121	You know, here's what I would say.	0
ClaimBuster	1122	All right, here we go again.	0
ClaimBuster	1123	Let me tell you, I'm going to force them right back into their country.	0
ClaimBuster	1124	Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago?	0
ClaimBuster	1125	They don't reach those goals.	0
ClaimBuster	1126	This permits a company to create uh - a dummy corporation, to export their products, and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them.	1
ClaimBuster	1127	Mine are words, and his was action.	0
ClaimBuster	1128	In addition to that, the build-up of military forces is good for our country because we've got to have military strength to preserve the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	1129	We were there for the better part of a year.	1
ClaimBuster	1130	OK. We need to create jobs here.	0
ClaimBuster	1131	This president chose a tax cut over homeland security.	1
ClaimBuster	1132	We had a good neighbor policy, yes.	0
ClaimBuster	1133	But -- but let me -- let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that.	1
ClaimBuster	1134	There are plenty of places to cut.	0
ClaimBuster	1135	The only thing I would say about that is, I think that on the economy, Mr. Bush said for a long time there was no recession, and then said it would be better to do nothing than to have a compromise effort with the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	1136	Well, let me just say I would...	0
ClaimBuster	1137	And my plan say why don't we pass 1.3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills?	0
ClaimBuster	1138	They could borrow the money and pay it back as a percentage of their income or with a couple of years of service to our nation here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	1139	But we can't just provide moral support.	0
ClaimBuster	1140	So all federal funds, instead of going to the -- to the state or to the school district, I'd have go, if you will, follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their -- their -- their student.	0
ClaimBuster	1141	When I said that we had to make sure that China was not flooding our domestic market with cheap tires, Governor Romney said I was being protectionist; that it wouldn't be helpful to American workers.	1
ClaimBuster	1142	But that's not what I believe.	0
ClaimBuster	1143	But then if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the Russians and then we'll have to meet our responsibilities to the security of the United States, and there may have to be testing underground.	0
ClaimBuster	1144	I believe we can do it.	0
ClaimBuster	1145	The people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	1146	I don't understand extending the no-fly zone in the south when the trouble was in the north.	0
ClaimBuster	1147	We've seen in the Nicaraguan example a policy that has actually hurt us, strengthened our opposition, and undermined the moral authority of our country in that region.	0
ClaimBuster	1148	Actually, Mr. President, in 1997 we fixed Medicare, and I was one of the people involved in it.	1
ClaimBuster	1149	But I tell you also now, Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	1150	I'm happy to say that, in contrast to that, the Anderson-Lucey platform for America, program for the 80s, has devoted considerable time, and in very specific detail, we have talked about two things that ought to be done to aid urban America.	1
ClaimBuster	1151	It's not driven by politics.	1
ClaimBuster	1152	We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s.	1
ClaimBuster	1153	The fact is that businesses in America today are paying the second highest tax rate of anywhere in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	1154	I believe in opening doors.	0
ClaimBuster	1155	There isn't one country in the Middle East that now endorses the Eisenhower Doctrine.	1
ClaimBuster	1156	There have been several indications that our prestige is not as high as it once was.	0
ClaimBuster	1157	In fact, I'm for shrinking the size of government.	1
ClaimBuster	1158	If it wasn't, they get their 10 minutes of fame.	0
ClaimBuster	1159	We have moved in Latin America very effectively, and I'd also like to point this out: Senator Kennedy complains very appropriately about our inadequate ra- radio broadcasts for Latin America.	1
ClaimBuster	1160	The farm income in America is high.	1
ClaimBuster	1161	But we also have to take demand seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	1162	These appointments are for life.	1
ClaimBuster	1163	I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now.	0
ClaimBuster	1164	I want to finally get something done on Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	1165	Let me get out of your way here.	0
ClaimBuster	1166	The Soviet Union has been engaged in the biggest military buildup in the history of man at the same time that we tried the policy of unilateral disarmament, of weakness, if you will.	1
ClaimBuster	1167	Over the long term, in order for us to compete with China, we've also got to make sure, though, that we're taking -- taking care of business here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	1168	I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983, and it is a combination of planned reduction of the tax increase that Carter has built into the economy, and that's what he's counting on for his plan.	0
ClaimBuster	1169	You just gave a speech a few weeks ago in which you said we should still have troops in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	1170	But it seems to me if we start to take choices away from people and if we drive them into one type care, eliminate fee-for-service altogether or eliminate the fact you can go to your own doctor, you have to go somewhere else, then I think we've taken a giant step backward in the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	1171	You can have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, which the President opposed and defeated.	1
ClaimBuster	1172	I'm not a politician, but I think I could go to Washington in a week and get everybody holding hands and get this bill signed because I talk to the Democratic leaders and they want it.	0
ClaimBuster	1173	I don't think he was misleading.	0
ClaimBuster	1174	Well, we have come to that position.	0
ClaimBuster	1175	But I would like to call the attention of the people to the fact that that so-called simple amendment would be used by mischievous men to destroy discriminations that properly belong, by law, to women respecting the physical differences between the two sexes, labor laws that protect them against things that would be physically harmful to them.	0
ClaimBuster	1176	But I do believe that we have to change our policies with Pakistan.	0
ClaimBuster	1177	So that one we came away with in creating jobs for the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	1178	I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders.	1
ClaimBuster	1179	You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be?	0
ClaimBuster	1180	I committed that I would rein in the excesses of Wall Street, and we passed the toughest Wall Street reforms since the 1930s.	1
ClaimBuster	1181	And we'll make whatever adjustment is necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	1182	Those are the people who ought to be in jail.	0
ClaimBuster	1183	It's a good package, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	1184	Now, long ago, I warned about Vladimir Putin.	1
ClaimBuster	1185	You'll actually do a better job, I think, of passing on the moral responsibility that is expressed in your question.	0
ClaimBuster	1186	And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?	0
ClaimBuster	1187	I was able for two years when I was in, a very young boy to go to a Catholic school, but I basically went to public schools all my life.	1
ClaimBuster	1188	I think everybody knows now we are in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	1189	I believe we have a responsibility to care for one another.	0
ClaimBuster	1190	more than doubled, and it rose at a faster rate than spending was rising in the Federal Government.	1
ClaimBuster	1191	That's because it comes at you, not from you.	0
ClaimBuster	1192	And I wish we had time to let me explain.	0
ClaimBuster	1193	And his emissary, I think, came home in 12 hours having heard a very definite nyet.	0
ClaimBuster	1194	This is what this election is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	1195	Bonus plans to keep some of our high-skilled folks in the services and a commander in chief who clearly sets the mission.	0
ClaimBuster	1196	It says, for example, that a woman doesn't have to go through a gate keeper to go to her gynecologist.	1
ClaimBuster	1197	Governor Romney says he wasn't referring to Arizona as a model for the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	1198	We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble.	0
ClaimBuster	1199	But the president made a mistake in invading Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	1200	Let me say again, we did have a drug czar in Arkansas, but he answered to the governor, just like this one answers to the President.	1
ClaimBuster	1201	And as a consequence, Al Qaeda's core leadership has been decimated.	1
ClaimBuster	1202	You know, we are at a defining moment in our history.	0
ClaimBuster	1203	But those are the issues on which we ought to be debating and if we can just put away the flag factories and the balloons and those kinds of thing and get on to a real discussion of these issues, I think we will have a good success.	0
ClaimBuster	1204	We've got ten and a half million new jobs; we've got record numbers of those new small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	1205	I think what really matters is what we can do to build strong families.	0
ClaimBuster	1206	So where else would you raise the revenue to provide this tax relief - would you, in fact, do away with all business deductions, and what other kinds of preferences would you do away with?	0
ClaimBuster	1207	And in my view, this is not the answer to the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	1208	Somebody went to a woman and nearly killed her.	1
ClaimBuster	1209	I can understand why you are, Mr. Mondale, because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	1210	I've been able to set clear goals.	0
ClaimBuster	1211	We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	1212	You know what that is?	0
ClaimBuster	1213	Well, first of all, I want to thank Hofstra University and the people of New York for hosting us tonight and it's wonderful to join Senator McCain again, and thank you, Bob.	0
ClaimBuster	1214	But if we spend and spend and spend, that is going to wrap up the housing market, and we'll go right back to the days of the misery index and malaise that President Reagan and I have overcome - thank God for the United States on that one.	0
ClaimBuster	1215	So now we've dug ourselves out of it, we're standing, but we're not yet running.	0
ClaimBuster	1216	Look at the Republicans that have endorsed me.	0
ClaimBuster	1217	The reason health-care costs are getting higher, one of the principal reasons is that this administration has stood in the way of common-sense efforts that would have reduced the costs.	0
ClaimBuster	1218	You're doing a great job, Tom.	0
ClaimBuster	1219	We need to insist that Arafat send out instructions to halt some of the provocative acts of violence that have been going on.	0
ClaimBuster	1220	I would never give up complete control or practical control of the Panama Canal Zone, but I would continue to negotiate with the Panamanians.	0
ClaimBuster	1221	Governor Carter again contradicts himself.	0
ClaimBuster	1222	Now, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they weren't to be abhorred -- that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment.	1
ClaimBuster	1223	Jim, the president began this segment, so I think I get the last word.	1
ClaimBuster	1224	And so I decided that a better way to approach the issue was to get other nations involved, just besides us.	0
ClaimBuster	1225	We need to go after the leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	1226	That is a rank mischaracterization.	0
ClaimBuster	1227	We had Saddam Hussein trapped.	1
ClaimBuster	1228	We've got to invest in college affordability.	0
ClaimBuster	1229	You judge on the record.	0
ClaimBuster	1230	It must -- as a last resort.	0
ClaimBuster	1231	I just want to get back to this home ownership.	0
ClaimBuster	1232	I didn't care whether he was a Republican or Democrat.	0
ClaimBuster	1233	And taking us back to those kinds of strategies that got us into this mess are not the way that we are going to maintain leadership in the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	1234	So, this has been my feeling about abortion, that we have a problem now to determine -- and all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being.	0
ClaimBuster	1235	I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward.	0
ClaimBuster	1236	Forty-four Democrats voted for it, one Republican voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	1237	And that stands in contrast to my worthy opponent's plan, which will increase the size of government dramatically.	1
ClaimBuster	1238	But sooner or later that credit card mentality isn't going to work.	0
ClaimBuster	1239	My state just became the only state in the nation to provide for universal health care and we did it with the support of the business community and labor and the health care community and with virtually everybody in the state.	1
ClaimBuster	1240	American seniors have the highest life expectancy in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	1241	I'll get our incomes up.	0
ClaimBuster	1242	The man loves his wife and I appreciate that a lot.	0
ClaimBuster	1243	In the rest of the world, the countries and the businesses would be working together to make this transition in an intelligent way.	0
ClaimBuster	1244	And I saw a unique threat in Saddam Hussein, as did my opponent, because we thought he had weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	1245	People are stopped, and we have to do something about that.	0
ClaimBuster	1246	We have been discouraged and we've been alienated.	0
ClaimBuster	1247	We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.	0
ClaimBuster	1248	There's no question about that.	0
ClaimBuster	1249	Hiring people temporarily who have lost their jobs and they get to work for 30 days or 60 days.	1
ClaimBuster	1250	Let's go back to the tax and budget summit briefly.	0
ClaimBuster	1251	That's not bad for a guy that's never been there, right?	0
ClaimBuster	1252	And we're asking to be able to allow you to get them.	0
ClaimBuster	1253	The world -- let me tell you.	0
ClaimBuster	1254	If you can make 50 cents in the heart of Mexico, for example, or make $5 here in America, $5.15, you're going to come here if you're worth your salt, if you want to put food on the table for your families.	0
ClaimBuster	1255	It's obvious that there are certain things that have to be done and there are 50 or 60 different options, and a bipartisan commission to take it out of politics, will make recommendations and build support for the people.	0
ClaimBuster	1256	And there are two very different paths the country can take.	0
ClaimBuster	1257	And sadly, she doesn't have that.	0
ClaimBuster	1258	"I wrote a book about it several years ago -- six, seven years ago -- called ""The New War,"" which saw the difficulties of this international criminal network."	1
ClaimBuster	1259	I hope they're not awful things.	0
ClaimBuster	1260	She's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	1261	Now, when we look at these programs, might I suggest that in evaluating them we often have a tendency to say that the test of a program is how much you're spending.	0
ClaimBuster	1262	And then Senator Dole's ardent supporters, Senator McCain, who's out there today, along with Senator Feingold, supported, sponsored a campaign finance reform proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	1263	I was able to do that in my state and bring these two together.	0
ClaimBuster	1264	And so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college.	0
ClaimBuster	1265	That's creating tens of thousands of jobs all across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	1266	That's what President Clinton did.	1
ClaimBuster	1267	In the meantime, though, we're not going to let up the pressure until we have clear evidence that that takes place.	0
ClaimBuster	1268	It's now four years later.	1
ClaimBuster	1269	Should I be fortunate enough to become your president, when I put my hand on the Bible, I will swear to not only uphold the laws of the land, but I will also swear to uphold the honor and the dignity of the office to which I have been elected, so help me God.	0
ClaimBuster	1270	In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it.	1
ClaimBuster	1271	There's other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	1272	On Social Security he's not.	0
ClaimBuster	1273	That wasn't going to work.	0
ClaimBuster	1274	I said I'm opposed to discrimination.	1
ClaimBuster	1275	And it's not the fact -- it's not the fact that Senator Obama chooses to associate with a guy who in 2001 said that he wished he had have bombed more, and he had a long association with him.	1
ClaimBuster	1276	And people are willing to invest capital in the brown fields don't want to do so for fear of lawsuit.	0
ClaimBuster	1277	And that's why we're doing what he suggested we do: Get the Brits, the Germans and the French to go make it very clear to the Iranians that if they expect to be a party to the world to give up their nuclear ambitions.	0
ClaimBuster	1278	I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do.	0
ClaimBuster	1279	This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election.	0
ClaimBuster	1280	That's why I think I'll win.	0
ClaimBuster	1281	And everything in there says what I am for.	0
ClaimBuster	1282	My opponent says he hadn't changed his position on it.	1
ClaimBuster	1283	That's what you like, you've got a perfect candidate.	0
ClaimBuster	1284	It is true over 10 years ago I voted to delay production of the F - 14, and I'll tell you why.	1
ClaimBuster	1285	But the bottom line is, we are the strongest nation in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	1286	He had two terms in the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	1287	And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election.	0
ClaimBuster	1288	We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before -- 2,300,000 more are receiving them -- even though we took 850,000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them.	1
ClaimBuster	1289	President Bush has taken -- he's the only president in history to do this.	1
ClaimBuster	1290	But, unlike Governor Reagan, I do not support a boondoggle like the MX missile.	1
ClaimBuster	1291	Why did our government do it?	0
ClaimBuster	1292	But the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we're going to get the middle class back on track.	0
ClaimBuster	1293	If you're getting interest from a bank, if you're getting a statement from a mutual fund or any other kind of investment you have, you don't have to worry about filing taxes on that, because there'll be no taxes for anybody making $200,000.00 per year and less, on your interest, dividends and capital gains.	1
ClaimBuster	1294	It's my - my opinion that the private sector, where five out of six jobs are, where you have permanent jobs, with the opportunity for advancement, is a better place than make-work jobs under the program recommended by the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	1295	Now, that's a fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	1296	I've done the same thing in the appointment of women, and also Spanish-speaking Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	1297	And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that.	1
ClaimBuster	1298	I want to get a better rate of return for your own money than the paltry 2% that the current Social Security Trust gets today.	0
ClaimBuster	1299	I think that in this 21st century we will soon see the consequences of what's called global warming.	0
ClaimBuster	1300	Personal income has dropped while people have worked harder.	1
ClaimBuster	1301	He is the chairman of the health committee.	1
ClaimBuster	1302	And right now, the commanders in Afghanistan, as well as Admiral Mullen, have acknowledged that we don't have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge.	1
ClaimBuster	1303	We can get this economy going again.	0
ClaimBuster	1304	And then I would like to appoint people who would be interested in helping with that.	0
ClaimBuster	1305	If you're a Medicare person, on Medicare, you don't get the new procedures.	1
ClaimBuster	1306	Rayburn says, yeah, and that guy never ran for sheriff either.	1
ClaimBuster	1307	Those are initiatives in foreign policy which are of the highest moral standard and that is indicative of the foreign policy of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	1308	His own analysis says that unemployment will be slightly higher in 1995 under his plan than it is today.	1
ClaimBuster	1309	First of all, most of good governance is at the state level.	0
ClaimBuster	1310	The Russians can't believe it.	0
ClaimBuster	1311	We've got a 30 percent or 40 percent unemployment rate among minority uh - young people.	1
ClaimBuster	1312	And in some cases may be still at large.	0
ClaimBuster	1313	The minute we have bilateral talks, the six-party talks will unwind.	0
ClaimBuster	1314	Twenty percent of the upper-income people pay about 80 percent of the taxes in America today because of how we structured the tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	1315	Energy is going to be key in dealing with Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	1316	We have cut inflation by better than half.	1
ClaimBuster	1317	I've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago.	1
ClaimBuster	1318	That was in an ad, Jim, that was knocked down by the journalists who analyzed the ad and said it was misleading.	1
ClaimBuster	1319	I look forward to discussing it more with him, as time goes on.	1
ClaimBuster	1320	If we got along well, that would be good.	0
ClaimBuster	1321	The president -- and this is one of the reasons why I am very proud in this race to have the support of General John Shalikashvili, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Admiral William Crowe, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; General Tony McPeak, who ran the air war for the president's father and did a brilliant job, supporting me; General Wes Clark, who won the war in Kosovo, supporting me; because they all -- and General Baca, who was the head of the National Guard, supporting me.	1
ClaimBuster	1322	I don't dislike trial lawyers.	0
ClaimBuster	1323	The president broke the pay-as-you-go rule.	1
ClaimBuster	1324	It had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies, I mean, billions of dollars worth.	1
ClaimBuster	1325	The Soviets try to spy on us, steal this stuff.	1
ClaimBuster	1326	As the economy improves, and it is improving, our gross national product this year will average about 6 percent increase over last year.	1
ClaimBuster	1327	Right under the Soviet gun, with Soviet troops there, he is in a very difficult position in taking anything independent, a position which would be independent of the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	1328	Obviously, we've got an immediate crisis right now.	0
ClaimBuster	1329	That happened long before I arrived in Washington, D.C.	1
ClaimBuster	1330	We just had a pretty serious dispute with China because they were copying our CDs, and costing thousands of jobs in places like California.	1
ClaimBuster	1331	Many of her friends took bigger deductions.	1
ClaimBuster	1332	We can have health care for all Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	1333	Now, to suggest that because two Republican presidents tried to pass the SALT treaty - that puts them on its side - I would like to say that President Ford, who was within 90% of a treaty that we could be in agreement with when he left office, is emphatically against this SALT treaty.	1
ClaimBuster	1334	So I don't want anybody out there to think we've just been voting no, no, no.	0
ClaimBuster	1335	Well, I might say that I think the League of Conservation Voters is absolutely right.	0
ClaimBuster	1336	This is a great country.	0
ClaimBuster	1337	The best way to take the pressure off our troops is to succeed in Iraq, is to train Iraqis so they can do the hard work of democracy, is to give them a chance to defend their country, which is precisely what we're doing.	1
ClaimBuster	1338	You can't be on one hand this way and one hand another.	0
ClaimBuster	1339	There's a -- no, look, there's a systemic problem.	0
ClaimBuster	1340	But the big argument I have with the governor on this is this taking different positions on different issues -- trying to be one thing to one person here that's opposing the NAFTA agreement and then for it -- what we call waffling.	1
ClaimBuster	1341	And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.	0
ClaimBuster	1342	... the money -- the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses -- the money that you're talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets.	1
ClaimBuster	1343	He went down and made a speech to people who were on his side saying that I did the wrong thing.	1
ClaimBuster	1344	In terms of negative campaigning, you know, I don't want to sound like a kid in the schoolyard: he started it.	0
ClaimBuster	1345	And I will stand up for that right.	0
ClaimBuster	1346	Let me say what I've said already about this pardon issue.	0
ClaimBuster	1347	And as the percentage of the population is increasing nationally, somehow the allegation that we don't care and we're going to give money for this interest or that interest and not for children in the State of Texas is totally absurd.	1
ClaimBuster	1348	We passed a bill in 1992 that encouraged the states to adopt programs to stop kids from smoking.	1
ClaimBuster	1349	So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is.	0
ClaimBuster	1350	And that's why I have consistently said that, if we can work more effectively with other countries diplomatically to tighten sanctions on Iran, if we can reduce our energy consumption through alternative energy, so that Iran has less money, if we can impose the kinds of sanctions that, say, for example, Iran right now imports gasoline, even though it's an oil-producer, because its oil infrastructure has broken down, if we can prevent them from importing the gasoline that they need and the refined petroleum products, that starts changing their cost-benefit analysis.	1
ClaimBuster	1351	With the United States, as he said, not so much.	1
ClaimBuster	1352	Too often in appraising whether we are moving ahead or not we think only of what the federal government is doing.	0
ClaimBuster	1353	I believe that it is important to tell the truth to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	1354	We drove our schools to be number one in the nation.	0
ClaimBuster	1355	Those words mean something to me, as somebody who has been in combat.	0
ClaimBuster	1356	Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets.	1
ClaimBuster	1357	And I do think that you can't turn the White House into the Waffle House.	0
ClaimBuster	1358	I've voted eight, ten times since 1965.	1
ClaimBuster	1359	The Strunk family in Allentown, Pennsylvania, I campaigned with them the other day.	1
ClaimBuster	1360	I didn't favor it when it was in, started.	0
ClaimBuster	1361	Well, the program that he's proposing is not the one that he just described.	1
ClaimBuster	1362	And you must ask yourself, do you know enough about the candidates?	0
ClaimBuster	1363	We live-we bring everybody along.	0
ClaimBuster	1364	I would say, too, that when Senator Kennedy refers to the action of the House Rules Committee, there are eight Democrats on that committee and four Republicans.	1
ClaimBuster	1365	Here's the problem -- that for about 20 million people, you may find yourselves no longer having employer-based health insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	1366	But we have an opportunity -- we have an opportunity to use our research and development capacities, the great technology of the United States, to make our military lighter, harder to find, more lethal.	1
ClaimBuster	1367	As regarding Mr. Perot, I take back something I said about him.	0
ClaimBuster	1368	Well, it is an open discussion.	0
ClaimBuster	1369	We've done about all, we are the reform party, the Republican Party.	0
ClaimBuster	1370	The governors -- and I believe Governor Clinton was in on this -- but maybe -- I don't want to invoke him here.	0
ClaimBuster	1371	But, as Senator Kennedy said in January of this year in this same press conference, the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction, which means that all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers' salaries.	1
ClaimBuster	1372	Libya understood that America and others will enforce doctrine and that the world is better for it.	0
ClaimBuster	1373	We have to help these nations create civil societies.	0
ClaimBuster	1374	You can't hire a lobbyist uh out of unemployment compensation checks.	0
ClaimBuster	1375	It permits us to make sure that the projects which are invested in are going to produce greater wealth.	0
ClaimBuster	1376	I think we have an obligation to spend that kind of money.	0
ClaimBuster	1377	Secondly, Syria is an opportunity for us because Syria plays an important role in the Middle East, particularly right now.	0
ClaimBuster	1378	... or at an airport near you.	0
ClaimBuster	1379	We're the only two lawyers in Washington that trust each other.	0
ClaimBuster	1380	That's why I'm running for president, and that's what I hope we're going to be talking about tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	1381	Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands -- excuse me.	0
ClaimBuster	1382	It was killed in the Rules Committee.	1
ClaimBuster	1383	In fact, Mr. Ayers has become the centerpiece of Senator McCain's campaign over the last two or three weeks.	0
ClaimBuster	1384	And the president should lead a national effort to change behavior, to keep our children alive in the schools, responsible behavior to keep people alive.	0
ClaimBuster	1385	In the first place, they made a fatal error in misjudging the Communists; in trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world.	0
ClaimBuster	1386	I got some of the details wrong last week in some of the examples that I used, Jim, and I'm sorry about that.	1
ClaimBuster	1387	Now, that transition has to take place in a responsible fashion.	0
ClaimBuster	1388	But he has a responsibility to be accurate, and not to misstate the case.	0
ClaimBuster	1389	I happened to believe strong accountability encourages parental involvement, though.	0
ClaimBuster	1390	It's not the same as Simpson- Bowles.	0
ClaimBuster	1391	Thank you, and good night.	0
ClaimBuster	1392	As a matter of fact, it is the economic recovery program that we presented when I took office in 1981.	1
ClaimBuster	1393	Every middle class family is eligible for a tax cut under my proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	1394	I wish I knew the law that said all of us would be good parents.	0
ClaimBuster	1395	And that was unpopular, but it was the right thing to do.	0
ClaimBuster	1396	I went to Washington to solve problems.	1
ClaimBuster	1397	And to suggest -- am I incorrect in that regard, on Sunday, the -- your secretary --	0
ClaimBuster	1398	We created a 10 percent bracket to help lower-income Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	1399	And General Petraeus says we have had great success, but it's very fragile.	1
ClaimBuster	1400	For me, I look at what's happened in the last four years and say this has been a disappointment.	0
ClaimBuster	1401	And we are now looking at a deficit of well over half a trillion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	1402	I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think he will because under his plan if you work out the numbers Ã‚ $100 billion comes out of Medicare just for the wealthiest 1% in the tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	1403	And one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates and women are getting the same fair deal as men are.	0
ClaimBuster	1404	Spending was only up something like 4 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	1405	And now we hear a lot of talk, oh, well, we all want enterprise zones, and yet the House and the Senate can't send it down without loading it up with a lot of, you know, these Christmas tree ornaments they put on the legislation.	0
ClaimBuster	1406	I want to come back and tell you why, but if you will forgive me, I would like to say something right now at the beginning of this debate following on the moment of silence for Mel Carnahan and Randy Carnahan and Chris Sifford.	0
ClaimBuster	1407	"But in return for extra spending, we now want people to measure -- states and local jurisdictions to measure to show us whether or not a child can read or write or add and subtract. """	0
ClaimBuster	1408	It's almost you remember that expression, get the lead out?	0
ClaimBuster	1409	They can't live in the community which they grew up in.	0
ClaimBuster	1410	So, I don't want to fool around with it.	0
ClaimBuster	1411	"About another woman, he said, ""That wouldn't be my first choice."""	1
ClaimBuster	1412	Let me say at the outset, uh - I'm very proud of the record of this administration.	0
ClaimBuster	1413	I didn't think I'd say this, but I'm going to say it, and I hate to say it.	0
ClaimBuster	1414	She's telling us how to fight ISIS.	1
ClaimBuster	1415	That's working with other nations.	0
ClaimBuster	1416	The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can't believe they allowed us to do this.	1
ClaimBuster	1417	There's just a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	1418	And we're more respected because of the way we have conducted ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	1419	We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	1420	I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?	0
ClaimBuster	1421	If you do, you invite the taking of more hostages.	0
ClaimBuster	1422	I have a plan to cover those folks.	1
ClaimBuster	1423	A capital gains differential will increase jobs, increase risk taking, increase revenues to the Federal Government.	0
ClaimBuster	1424	And so what I want is a -- is a comprehensive strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	1425	And so let's kind of stay on the issue, and I have made a specific proposal for what I call a flexible freeze.	0
ClaimBuster	1426	Now, what he says is he's going to make sure that this doesn't add to the deficit and he's going to cut middleclass taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	1427	Because part of Russia's intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where President Saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that Putin favored more.	1
ClaimBuster	1428	Well, I would repeal and replace it.	0
ClaimBuster	1429	Now, what happens is when you begin to get people covered like that -- for instance in diabetes, if you diagnose diabetes early, you could save $50 billion in the health care system of America by avoiding surgery and dialysis.	1
ClaimBuster	1430	Those things will get us the energy we need.	0
ClaimBuster	1431	It was the largest expansion of private insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	1432	This is something I take seriously and that's my position.	0
ClaimBuster	1433	I've worked on these things for 12 years and I'm the only person up here who hasn't been part of Washington in any way for the last 20 years.	1
ClaimBuster	1434	I think that conservation - I think that a change in lifestyles - is necessary, and we had better begin to plan for that now rather than later.	0
ClaimBuster	1435	I hope some day it will rise; but I don't think it will rise if we continue the same policies toward Cuba that we did in recent years, and in fact towards all of Latin America - when we've almost ignored the needs of Latin America; we've beamed not a single Voice of America program in Spanish to all of Latin America in the last eight years, except for the three months of the Hungarian uh - revolution.	1
ClaimBuster	1436	And if you can't, there will be a federal consequence.	0
ClaimBuster	1437	We ought to move forward swiftly on my ideas of ethanol which would use more corn, and therefore, create a bigger market for our agricultural products.	1
ClaimBuster	1438	The American people had lost faith and trust and confidence in the presidency itself.	0
ClaimBuster	1439	Georgie Anne, we, believe me, supported the Simpson-Mazzoli bill strongly -- and the bill that came out of the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	1440	We've been drifting too long.	0
ClaimBuster	1441	And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them.	1
ClaimBuster	1442	I would like to have a crusade today, and I would like to lead that crusade with your help.	0
ClaimBuster	1443	And since then, for years, I have lived with the burden of the Middle East, where it's eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth country, in terms of their unhappiness with the fact that I was successful in that effort.	1
ClaimBuster	1444	If I make a mistake, I admit it.	0
ClaimBuster	1445	I'm against quotas, they're illegal.	0
ClaimBuster	1446	We're working hard to sign up children.	0
ClaimBuster	1447	And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet...	1
ClaimBuster	1448	But the enemy attacked us, Jim, and I have a solemn duty to protect the American people, to do everything I can to protect us.	1
ClaimBuster	1449	And some major uh - uh - manufacturing companies, like Dow Chemical, have through uh - very effective efficiency mechanism cut down the use of energy by uh - as much as 40 percent with the same out-product.	1
ClaimBuster	1450	Prior to Darfur, Ambassador Jack Danforth had been negotiating a north-south agreement that we would have hoped would have brought peace to the Sudan.	1
ClaimBuster	1451	Now, it wasn't just on Wall Street.	0
ClaimBuster	1452	But time is our friend there, because their leaders will change in not too many years, worst case, and their country is making great progress.	0
ClaimBuster	1453	We're down to 336 ships.	1
ClaimBuster	1454	People from both political parties came together in the halls of Congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice.	1
ClaimBuster	1455	Now that's an issue between Mr. Nixon and myself.	0
ClaimBuster	1456	We got to cut it out.	0
ClaimBuster	1457	We may differ about what the elements of that are.	0
ClaimBuster	1458	we're confronted with the horrendous problems that we've discussed here tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	1459	I've also learned that there are no simple answers to complicated questions.	0
ClaimBuster	1460	And that's what the No Child Left Behind Act does.	0
ClaimBuster	1461	If we're going to ask young men and young women to protect us and defend us around the world, and we've had more deployments under this administration than any time in history.	0
ClaimBuster	1462	It seemed to me the violence stopped when these leaders came to America.	0
ClaimBuster	1463	Well, let me just follow up, my friends.	0
ClaimBuster	1464	He called them coerced and the bribed.	1
ClaimBuster	1465	We're a country of laws.	0
ClaimBuster	1466	I know that the people you pick make an enormous difference in your ability to govern and I set high standards.	0
ClaimBuster	1467	So we got to be guarded in our generosity.	0
ClaimBuster	1468	They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul.	1
ClaimBuster	1469	But John is right we have to make cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	1470	That's the choice you'll have is having your employer no longer provide you health care.	0
ClaimBuster	1471	Show us if they are learning to read, write, add and subtract and if so there will be bonus plans.	0
ClaimBuster	1472	Let's be honest about it.	0
ClaimBuster	1473	In addition to that, the adversarial relationship between ourselves and the Soviet Union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly.	0
ClaimBuster	1474	But there are limits to what we can spend.	0
ClaimBuster	1475	America's going to come back, and for that to happen, we're going to have to have a president who can work across the aisle.	0
ClaimBuster	1476	Then I would really focus on let's get these things out.	0
ClaimBuster	1477	And that is very important.	0
ClaimBuster	1478	So I think our selection uh - of Bob Dole as vice president uh - is based on merit.	0
ClaimBuster	1479	That makes life a lot easier.	0
ClaimBuster	1480	We have for example a gross national product of approximately five hundred billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	1481	But no, I'm for the sanctity of life, and once that illegality is established, then we can come to grips with the penalty side, and of course there's got to be some penalties to enforce the law, whatever they may be.	0
ClaimBuster	1482	We've got to remain energy-independent.	0
ClaimBuster	1483	And then we have his own record, which is we have four consecutive years where he said when he was running for office, he would cut the deficit in half.	1
ClaimBuster	1484	We hammerlock the American companies -- American Airlines, Delta -- the last few great we have, because we're trying to do this deal with these 2 European companies.	1
ClaimBuster	1485	There's no way for our people now to understand what their government is.	0
ClaimBuster	1486	Well, Republicans and Democrats came together on a bipartisan basis to put in place education principles that focused on having great teachers in the classroom.	1
ClaimBuster	1487	I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it.	0
ClaimBuster	1488	Is our relative strength growing?	0
ClaimBuster	1489	And this is not personal -- there are deep differences about our future, and that's the basis of my campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	1490	I I think that, technically, I know this is a difficult and an emotional problem, and many people sincerely feel on both sides of this, but I do believe that maybe we could find the answer through medical evidence, if we would determine once and for all, is an unborn child a human being?	0
ClaimBuster	1491	If we're not training engineers to make sure that they are equipped here in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	1492	And as a matter of fact, I think for most people the notion of President Quayle is a very very troubling thought.	0
ClaimBuster	1493	The trial lawyers, of course they like lawsuits, so every time they have a bill that they want vetoed, the president vetoes it for them.	1
ClaimBuster	1494	Because if they succeed, I believe the country succeeds.	0
ClaimBuster	1495	This is a leadership role that the United States under this administration is carrying out, and if we do it, and I think the opportunities and the possibilities are getting better, we will have solved many of the internal domestic problems that exist in South Korea at the present time.	0
ClaimBuster	1496	But we have to have a government that is responsive to the Afghan people, and, frankly, it's just not responsive right now.	0
ClaimBuster	1497	"The ""we"" is you and me."	0
ClaimBuster	1498	I think tax policy is a major difference between Senator McCain and myself.	0
ClaimBuster	1499	I will not cut benefits.	0
ClaimBuster	1500	So, under the circumstances, what do we do?	0
ClaimBuster	1501	Terrorists can now come into America and go to a gun show and, without even a background check, buy an assault weapon today.	1
ClaimBuster	1502	You do a lot of things nobody knows about.	0
ClaimBuster	1503	We don't want to get drawn into a military conflict.	0
ClaimBuster	1504	And one last thing -- just -- just to make this point.	0
ClaimBuster	1505	In all due respect, I'm not so sure it's credible to quote leading news organizations about -- oh, never mind.	0
ClaimBuster	1506	I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there.	0
ClaimBuster	1507	And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up -- it's true -- but they've gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years.	1
ClaimBuster	1508	This is a political year, and the President is playing politics with Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	1509	He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.	1
ClaimBuster	1510	Can you say that a little louder, Candy?	0
ClaimBuster	1511	We have to work with Nigeria.	0
ClaimBuster	1512	"He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: ""You complain, I'll get you deported."""	1
ClaimBuster	1513	You have to tell me one time when you have stood up with the leaders of your party on one single major issue.	0
ClaimBuster	1514	But it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.	1
ClaimBuster	1515	Well, the White House is a bully pulpit, and I think we ought to be pounding on the table every day.	0
ClaimBuster	1516	We just can't afford four more years like the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	1517	I sent up my budget man to the Congress, and he says, here's how we're going to reduce the deficit in half by five years.	1
ClaimBuster	1518	All I said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements, because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places.	1
ClaimBuster	1519	Now, we may not succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	1520	Our tax structure is a disgrace, it needs to be reformed.	0
ClaimBuster	1521	Now that the voices in the Congress and throughout the country have insisted that we do something about China, look at what has happened.	0
ClaimBuster	1522	Well, when it comes to ridicule, George, you win a gold medal.	0
ClaimBuster	1523	But let's get at the bottom line.	0
ClaimBuster	1524	And I make it plain again: I am for women's rights.	0
ClaimBuster	1525	--notwithstanding my opponent's ad, my plan triggers in at gross incomes, family incomes of $200,000 and above.	1
ClaimBuster	1526	We are not at war with Islam.	1
ClaimBuster	1527	I hope not in both cases.	0
ClaimBuster	1528	And -- and I -- I think the president just said correctly that the buck does stop at his desk and -- and he takes responsibility for -- for that -- for the failure in providing those security resources, and -- and those terrible things may well happen from time to time.	0
ClaimBuster	1529	And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas.	1
ClaimBuster	1530	I would like to know from the governor -- I know we're not supposed to ask each other questions -- but I'd be interested in knowing, does that trillion dollars come from the trust fund, or does it come from the rest of the budget?	0
ClaimBuster	1531	And I think that there's a general agreement in many parts of the world now that there ought to be changes in the IMF.	0
ClaimBuster	1532	And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don't even know if it's accurate information, and then they put it out.	1
ClaimBuster	1533	I think that part of it is the crime infested neighborhoods, and that's why I'm a strong believer in trying to control crimes in the neighborhood, why I was so pleased to be endorsed by the policemen on the beat, the Boston Police Department the other day.	1
ClaimBuster	1534	That will change when I'm president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	1535	I think the President genuinely believes that they're better off.	0
ClaimBuster	1536	"With regard to Social Security, I hope there'll be more time than just this minute to mention that, but I will say this: A President should never say ""never.''"	0
ClaimBuster	1537	I hope over the next ten years you will see a big increase over the percentage of people that have pension plans, plus a secure Social Security system.	0
ClaimBuster	1538	And that really is going to be a challenge for the next president of the United States; I don't think there's any question about it.	0
ClaimBuster	1539	So I tried diplomacy, went to the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	1540	We need to do better in job retraining.	0
ClaimBuster	1541	And the president and I have a difference of opinion about how we live out our sense of our faith.	0
ClaimBuster	1542	I've had to make thousands of decisions, and each one of those decisions has been a learning process.	1
ClaimBuster	1543	And my program is this.	0
ClaimBuster	1544	I believe the president of the United States should indicate it.	0
ClaimBuster	1545	Because the tax code is unfair for people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.	0
ClaimBuster	1546	The question is: are we moving in the direction of peace and security?	0
ClaimBuster	1547	Some of them are in public life in the Senate, the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	1548	That's not the right course for America.	0
ClaimBuster	1549	For instance, we're flying unmanned vehicles that can send real- time messages back to stations in the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	1550	And I've put forward a plan to make sure that we're bringing manufacturing jobs back to our shores by rewarding companies and small businesses that are investing here, not overseas.	1
ClaimBuster	1551	Forty-one percent of those 10 million are women.	1
ClaimBuster	1552	He can talk about Iran/Contra and also-I'll make a deal with you, I will take the blame for those two incidents if you give me half the credit for all the good things that have happened in world peace since Ronald Reagan and I took over from the Carter administration.	0
ClaimBuster	1553	And if you have some of each -- and I have some age, some experience and some intelligence -- that adds up to wisdom.	0
ClaimBuster	1554	We're trying to solve it.	0
ClaimBuster	1555	You just don't make unilateral cuts in the naive hope that the Soviets are going to behave themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	1556	Pardon means that what you did, whether it's right or wrong, you're forgiven for it.	1
ClaimBuster	1557	So that is not the way our democracy works.	0
ClaimBuster	1558	But the best thing to do is to reform Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	1559	The American people don't know what those commitments are.	0
ClaimBuster	1560	These things are paid for in the balanced budget plan.	1
ClaimBuster	1561	That's why we say mutual and verifiable freezes.	0
ClaimBuster	1562	Was it the right thing to do?	0
ClaimBuster	1563	It might be an oil fire, it might be a jet exhaust, the computer might decide it's a missile -- and off we go.	0
ClaimBuster	1564	Second, he's wrong in the analogies that he makes.	0
ClaimBuster	1565	I think that this farm policy has failed.	0
ClaimBuster	1566	I think it is disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in Social Security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness, and they are receiving disability checks from Social Security every month while a state institution provides for all of their needs and their care.	1
ClaimBuster	1567	He was president for 3 years before he proposed a health care plan that still hasn't been sent to Congress in total; three years before an economic plan, and he still didn't say tonight that that tax bill he vetoed raised taxes only on the rich and gave the rest of you a break -- but he vetoed it anyway.	1
ClaimBuster	1568	And we work with those other countries.	0
ClaimBuster	1569	First thing I'm going to do is ask the Secretary of Defense to develop a plan so we are making sure we're not spending our money on political projects, but on projects to make sure our soldiers are well-paid, well-housed, and have the best equipment in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	1570	I think you put your finger on a major problem.	0
ClaimBuster	1571	But they're on line and they're waiting to become citizens.	1
ClaimBuster	1572	Well, it is a terribly painful situation for Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	1573	Well, Oliver, first, let me tell you what's in the rescue package for you.	0
ClaimBuster	1574	They must go hand in hand, but the security of this nation has got to come first.	0
ClaimBuster	1575	Now, results is what counts.	0
ClaimBuster	1576	Convention, the VFW National Convention - when I spoke to each of those bodies - I outlined a very specific program of increasing pay and allowances, reenlistment bonuses.	1
ClaimBuster	1577	We're going to have borders in our country, which we don't have now.	0
ClaimBuster	1578	And that's exactly what I have proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	1579	And we have two fundamentally different visions of America.	0
ClaimBuster	1580	This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party, as exemplified by the actions that I have taken in the Oval Office the last four years, as contrasted with Governor Reagan, who in most cases does typify his party, but in some cases, there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others.	0
ClaimBuster	1581	But we went in in the interest of peace and to keep Israel and Syria from getting into the sixth war between them.	1
ClaimBuster	1582	Imagine how many IRS agents it is going to take to be able to figure out his targeted tax cut for the middle class that excludes 50 million Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	1583	I don't favor a litmus test, but I know that there are ways to assess how a potential justice interprets the Constitution.	0
ClaimBuster	1584	And I am not apologetic at all about our record with women.	0
ClaimBuster	1585	But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped?	0
ClaimBuster	1586	Let's put it in terms that all of us can understand.	0
ClaimBuster	1587	Put those jobs in the inner cities instead of doing diplomatic deals and shipping them to China where prison labor does the work.	0
ClaimBuster	1588	OK, so it hasn't fallen.	0
ClaimBuster	1589	He could leave the parties in doubt as to which one he would use; and therefore there would be incentive, instead of as now - the steel companies were ready to take the strike because they felt the injunction of eighty days would break the union, which didn't happen.	1
ClaimBuster	1590	And I got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if there's anybody here who thinks there aren't agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	1591	As president of the United States, Alan, I would order the secretary of the treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in America and renegotiate at the new value of those homes -- at the diminished value of those homes and let people be able to make those -- be able to make those payments and stay in their homes.	0
ClaimBuster	1592	Senator Kennedy is in the hospital.	1
ClaimBuster	1593	So let's not be throwing stones about it.	0
ClaimBuster	1594	We're making really good progress.	0
ClaimBuster	1595	It requires pro-growth policies that grow our economy and fiscal sanity in the halls of Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	1596	But don't forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years' worth of breaks, into -- into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1.	1
ClaimBuster	1597	Now I understand it's been extended 'til some time next year.	1
ClaimBuster	1598	The farm payments are going down because the agricultural economy is coming back.	1
ClaimBuster	1599	Energy independence for North America in five years.	0
ClaimBuster	1600	Millions of jobs were lost, the auto industry was on the brink of collapse.	1
ClaimBuster	1601	He founded authored, the job training partnership act.	1
ClaimBuster	1602	Now that sounds to me a little bit different.	0
ClaimBuster	1603	But policies that give people a helping hand so they can help themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	1604	Look, now she's blaming -- she got caught in a total lie.	0
ClaimBuster	1605	And the only reason they did it is because she's running for the office of president and they want to look tough.	0
ClaimBuster	1606	That's not how America became the greatest country on the face of the earth.	0
ClaimBuster	1607	Within that sixty-billion dollars increase there would be fit the programs that I promised the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	1608	So I would be firm.	0
ClaimBuster	1609	And so please, go to...	0
ClaimBuster	1610	And then how about a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution?	0
ClaimBuster	1611	Is that a -- is that a separate topic?	0
ClaimBuster	1612	And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us.	0
ClaimBuster	1613	And the testimony under oath was to the effect that I did not talk to Mr. Nixon, to Mr. Haldeman, to Mr. Ehrlichman, or to any of the people at the White House.	1
ClaimBuster	1614	And we need to make sure they have the arms they need to carry out the very important role which is getting rid of Assad.	0
ClaimBuster	1615	I would say first of all that we must have in mind the fact that we have been negotiating to get tests inspected and uh - to get an agreement for many, many months.	1
ClaimBuster	1616	That was a give away and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works.	0
ClaimBuster	1617	And housing has begun to rise.	1
ClaimBuster	1618	They can't squeeze another desk in for her, so she has to stand during class.	0
ClaimBuster	1619	I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help.	0
ClaimBuster	1620	That's the kind of approach that will work.	0
ClaimBuster	1621	At the point when I could not get them to address those problems, I had created so much stress in the board, who wanted to just keep the Lawrence Welk music going, that they asked to buy my remaining shares.	1
ClaimBuster	1622	And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country.	1
ClaimBuster	1623	And there's nothing corny about having sports heroes, young people that are clean and honorable and out there setting the pace.	0
ClaimBuster	1624	I believe that discipline and respect for the law -- all of these things should be taught to children, not in our schools, but families have to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	1625	It's not just more troops.	0
ClaimBuster	1626	I -- I find it ironic that he's raising nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	1627	Now, you cite a study.	1
ClaimBuster	1628	Well, let me take him up on this question of farm subsidies.	0
ClaimBuster	1629	And then that number disappears for high-income people.	1
ClaimBuster	1630	[Laughter] I don't have a plan to tax -- or increase taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	1631	Now, just remember when you think about me -- I didn't create this mess.	0
ClaimBuster	1632	We will drill more oil and gas wells this year than any year in history.	0
ClaimBuster	1633	When I was governor of Massachusetts, to get a high school degree, you had to pass an exam.	1
ClaimBuster	1634	When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president.	1
ClaimBuster	1635	I don't think it's the issues that turn kids off.	0
ClaimBuster	1636	And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work.	0
ClaimBuster	1637	My balanced budget plan puts ten years on the Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	1638	We will do what we do best.	0
ClaimBuster	1639	He said in his first year he'd put out an immigration plan that would deal with our immigration challenges.	1
ClaimBuster	1640	Well, tonight we had the first debate over the deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	1641	He said the standard bearer wasn't for it.	1
ClaimBuster	1642	Let's, first of all, understand that the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system.	0
ClaimBuster	1643	It's critical to our future.	0
ClaimBuster	1644	He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like.	0
ClaimBuster	1645	We have to start to spend the money now.	0
ClaimBuster	1646	The year that he decided we had lost our way was the year that John F. Kennedy was running against Richard Nixon.	1
ClaimBuster	1647	But we aren't going to move America forward and we aren't going to be able to lead the world to win this struggle for freedom if we have a permanent inferiority complex about American achievements.	0
ClaimBuster	1648	How can we extend freedom - extend it without war?	0
ClaimBuster	1649	There has never been anything like this, where e-mails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.	1
ClaimBuster	1650	I hope that Senator Obama will repudiate those remarks that were made by Congressman John Lewis, very unfair and totally inappropriate.	0
ClaimBuster	1651	I guess I rely more on the individual.	0
ClaimBuster	1652	And I would cite again Dan Quayle.	0
ClaimBuster	1653	I've served this country for fourteen years in the Congress and before that in the service.	1
ClaimBuster	1654	I've laid out a plan by which I think we can be successful in Iraq: with a summit, by doing better training, faster, by cutting -- by doing what we need to do with respect to the U.N. and the elections.	1
ClaimBuster	1655	I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters.	0
ClaimBuster	1656	And the thought that we would share this with the Soviet Union is, in my opinion, a total non-STARTer.	0
ClaimBuster	1657	"""Those are the three words that she left me with."	1
ClaimBuster	1658	And that's one of the major issues in this uh - campaign of 1976.	0
ClaimBuster	1659	We have disagreed, I believe, on virtually every other issue.	0
ClaimBuster	1660	We have to -- it has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it.	0
ClaimBuster	1661	In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don't need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have.	0
ClaimBuster	1662	The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana, and I regret it.	1
ClaimBuster	1663	He said, we will look at offshore drilling.	1
ClaimBuster	1664	I think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively.	0
ClaimBuster	1665	The opportunities that the child will -- will be able to achieve increase dramatically.	0
ClaimBuster	1666	Uh - the Department of uh - uh - HUD is enforcing the new legislation that uhh - outlaws, that takes care of redlining.	1
ClaimBuster	1667	So hold the line on Social Security and put a cap on the growth of the mandatory program.	0
ClaimBuster	1668	We don't know -- there are no inspectors now in Iraq, the coalition that was in place isn't as strong as it used to be.	1
ClaimBuster	1669	It's clear for everybody to see.	0
ClaimBuster	1670	I've visited so many communities.	1
ClaimBuster	1671	Love your neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself.	0
ClaimBuster	1672	I send them there, oftentimes into harm's way.	1
ClaimBuster	1673	We couldn't get it done, because I wasn't enforceable.	0
ClaimBuster	1674	Mr. Nixon said that we should not regard them as pawns in the cold war; we should identify ourselves with them.	1
ClaimBuster	1675	Do you want to give me some suggestions?	0
ClaimBuster	1676	I want to thank the League of Women Voters, the good citizens of Kansas City, and President Reagan for agreeing to debate this evening.	0
ClaimBuster	1677	High-income people are doing just fine in this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	1678	Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.	1
ClaimBuster	1679	But the president has underfunded it by $28 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	1680	Going to be more deaths that they thought.	0
ClaimBuster	1681	I think by acting firmly and decisively, it will mean it is less likely we have to use force.	0
ClaimBuster	1682	I'm sure you're aware, Senator Obama, of the program in the Washington, D.C., school system where vouchers are provided and there's a certain number, I think it's a thousand and some and some 9,000 parents asked to be eligible for that.	1
ClaimBuster	1683	Jim, the president just said something extraordinarily revealing and frankly very important in this debate.	0
ClaimBuster	1684	Four of them here tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	1685	One of the largest industries in the world is the travel and tourist business.	1
ClaimBuster	1686	She's got experience, but it's bad experience.	0
ClaimBuster	1687	Secondly, allow small businesses to pool together so they can share risk and buy insurance at the same discounts big businesses get to do.	0
ClaimBuster	1688	But history will look back, and I'm fully prepared to accept any mistakes that history judges to my administration, because the president makes the decisions, the president has to take the responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	1689	Of course we see in Syria, 30,000 civilians having been killed by the military there.	1
ClaimBuster	1690	What's happening in the Middle East, there are developments around the world that are of real concern.	0
ClaimBuster	1691	The world is more dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	1692	I believe that's the answer.	0
ClaimBuster	1693	Because you are the ones who have the hardest time paying taxes, the hardest time making ends meet.	0
ClaimBuster	1694	We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.	0
ClaimBuster	1695	What Senator McCain doesn't mention is he's been there 26 of them.	1
ClaimBuster	1696	"He keeps talking about, ""Let the inspectors do their job."""	0
ClaimBuster	1697	I wish we could spend an hour talking about trusting people.	0
ClaimBuster	1698	Yes, we have a $263 billion deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	1699	Everybody knows that including the people at the Pentagon.	0
ClaimBuster	1700	And I want to talk about my plan some more -- I hope we can.	0
ClaimBuster	1701	Of course we've got to do preparations, starting with low-level diplomatic talks, and it may not work, because Iran is a rogue regime.	0
ClaimBuster	1702	I agree that the surplus is the American people's money, it's your money.	0
ClaimBuster	1703	The president has a great responsibility.	1
ClaimBuster	1704	Those are the people, Democrats and Republicans, who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	1705	We'll be on again Saturday night, 8 to 9 o'clock on ABC.	1
ClaimBuster	1706	The United States has to be strong in order to make sure that we can help promote peace and security and stability.	0
ClaimBuster	1707	Having a tax code that rewards companies that are shipping jobs overseas instead of companies that are investing here in the United States, that will not make us more competitive.	0
ClaimBuster	1708	And so I just have a different approach.	0
ClaimBuster	1709	I have seen Communist influence and Castro influence rise in Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	1710	We're not able to consume what we're able to produce at a time when the Soviet Union is making great economic gains.	1
ClaimBuster	1711	And we admire your pluck and perseverance.	0
ClaimBuster	1712	And we've focused on the tactical.	0
ClaimBuster	1713	That had nothing to do with the other thing of talking about their needs or anything.	0
ClaimBuster	1714	So both those extremes grasp for advantage and the person who has to pay that expense is the middle-income family who's still working for a living and they have to pay for the rich who have privilege, and for the poor who are not working.	0
ClaimBuster	1715	Mr. Corddry, it's a shame now that there are only two of us here debating, because the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement on this particular issue, and the only one who would be disagreeing with us is the President, if he were present.	0
ClaimBuster	1716	I think that's about a realistic timeframe.	0
ClaimBuster	1717	My friends, do we need to spend that kind of money?	0
ClaimBuster	1718	And therefore on this question I don't think that there is any doubt in the mind of any American; I hope there is not any doubt in the mind of any member of the community of West Berlin; I'm sure there isn't any doubt in the mind of the Russians.	0
ClaimBuster	1719	All have to do is agree to refurbish it, make it habitable, and live in it - just as 100 or more years ago, we did with the open land in this country - urban .	0
ClaimBuster	1720	They put up the American flag.	0
ClaimBuster	1721	Now we have to succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	1722	Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago, there's an awful lot of violence and they're not using AK-47s.	1
ClaimBuster	1723	Mr. Putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries and/or entities invest capital, there's a reasonable rate of return, a way to get the money out of the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	1724	We have made so many bad deals during the last -- so she's got experience, that I agree.	0
ClaimBuster	1725	Yes, I think that that's a very good question, because I've heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	1726	There are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me.	1
ClaimBuster	1727	Doing better in the neighborhoods.	0
ClaimBuster	1728	We're headed down to the low 200s if we go through a sequestration.	0
ClaimBuster	1729	I know what it's like to see somebody you love nearly lose their lives, and I hate drugs, Senator.	0
ClaimBuster	1730	So it's adding to cost.	1
ClaimBuster	1731	Parents are going to have to show more responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	1732	I've got a plan on Medicare, for example, that's a two-stage plan that says we'll have immediate help for seniors and what I call immediate Helping Hand, a $48 billion program.	1
ClaimBuster	1733	I think we have to invest in education, protecting the environment, health care, a prescription drug benefit that goes to all seniors, not just to the poor, under Medicare, not relying on HMOs and insurance companies.	0
ClaimBuster	1734	He got a notice or he didn't.	0
ClaimBuster	1735	I think the woman that works with me, Rose Zamaria, is about as tough as a boot out there and makes some discipline and protects the taxpayer.	0
ClaimBuster	1736	I'm pleased that I've balanced budgets.	1
ClaimBuster	1737	There's no -- and we have to do them all at once.	0
ClaimBuster	1738	We've got home ownership at a 15-year high.	1
ClaimBuster	1739	Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system.	1
ClaimBuster	1740	You are familiar, of course, with the fact that I am the first president in thirty years who has reorganized the intelligence agencies in the federal government: the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the others.	1
ClaimBuster	1741	He doesn't want U.S. leadership, however, to send mixed signals, to not stand with the Iraqi people.	0
ClaimBuster	1742	We're going to block grant into the states.	0
ClaimBuster	1743	That's not a grand coalition.	0
ClaimBuster	1744	And yet Mr. Bush tried to cut their cost of living increase in 1985.	1
ClaimBuster	1745	We're still down 580,000 jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	1746	Brady Bill, I agree that it's a timid step in the right direction but it won't fix it.	0
ClaimBuster	1747	There have been some tough cases come across my desk.	0
ClaimBuster	1748	Well, it's not a matter of uh - Republican and Democrat.	0
ClaimBuster	1749	I think my dad would be pretty proud of me, because I think we've come a long long way and I think, you know three months ago, I remember some of the great publications in this country had written me off.	0
ClaimBuster	1750	Now, for four years that's what I worked on.	1
ClaimBuster	1751	Well, no, it's no answer to those 37 million people, most of them members of working families who don't have a dime of health insurance and don't know how to pay the bills if their kids get sick at night.	1
ClaimBuster	1752	One of the reasons we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have a gun or not.	0
ClaimBuster	1753	We're going to let everybody buy into the same health-care plan senators and congressmen give themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	1754	Our challenge is to stop the financial bleeding.	0
ClaimBuster	1755	This is the way we're going to create jobs in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	1756	It encourages the use of renewables like ethanol and biodiesel.	0
ClaimBuster	1757	We'll put in place the kind of principles that I put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured and we'll focus on getting the cost of health care down.	0
ClaimBuster	1758	And, as a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history took place 1977.	1
ClaimBuster	1759	If I'm president, I'll double them, and also get the -- the oil from offshore and Alaska.	0
ClaimBuster	1760	But we are putting our energy companies out of business.	1
ClaimBuster	1761	And I came to the conclusion that our love was strong enough to be able to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	1762	This is an issue they've brought up.	1
ClaimBuster	1763	Medicare is paid for by the American taxpayer.	1
ClaimBuster	1764	They just write a note for the interest.	0
ClaimBuster	1765	We have, with our five-year plan for the leasing of offshore lands, proposed more land to be drilled than has been opened up for drilling since this program first started in 1954.	1
ClaimBuster	1766	And so part of the problem, I think, for a lot of people who are listening here tonight is they don't feel as if they are sharing the burden with other folks.	0
ClaimBuster	1767	And we ought to expand our markets abroad.	0
ClaimBuster	1768	Well, first, let me say there you go again, Mr. President, talking about a Medicare cut.	0
ClaimBuster	1769	We have a big program in my state that teaches mothers or fathers to teach their kids to get ready for school.	1
ClaimBuster	1770	We've got to treat it as international crime.	0
ClaimBuster	1771	And his own uh - Office of Management and Budget testified that he had a $3 billion cut insurance added to the defense budget - defense budget under the pressure from the Pentagon.	1
ClaimBuster	1772	Nuclear is the single greatest threat.	0
ClaimBuster	1773	Well, that just isn't true.	0
ClaimBuster	1774	But it's going to take some study and some work, and not just passing a tax increase to let the load - or the roof - fall in on the next administration.	0
ClaimBuster	1775	That's part of my health care plan.	1
ClaimBuster	1776	Let me just say, Bob.	0
ClaimBuster	1777	We've opened 260,000 new jobs in the military to women since I've been president.	1
ClaimBuster	1778	That doesn't restrict people's freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	1779	Now, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, and you will then fall into the category where you'll have to pay a fine if you don't provide health insurance that Senator Obama mandates, not the kind that you think is best for your family, your children, your employees, but the kind that he mandates for you.	1
ClaimBuster	1780	I met a man who spent eight months in prison, wasn't even allowed to call his lawyer, wasn't allowed to get -- finally, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois intervened and was able to get him out.	1
ClaimBuster	1781	A lot remains to be done.	0
ClaimBuster	1782	I'm happy to do that, too.	0
ClaimBuster	1783	I think that in ten years, we can reduce our dependence so that we no longer have to import oil from the Middle East or Venezuela.	0
ClaimBuster	1784	It's not good for the country and it's not right.	0
ClaimBuster	1785	Mr. Nixon resigned, and I became president.	1
ClaimBuster	1786	But we're going to have to work with the -- with the people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that they're on.	0
ClaimBuster	1787	Pakistan is -- is technically an ally, and they're not acting very much like an ally right now.	0
ClaimBuster	1788	The notion, though, that because we're not doing town hall meetings that justifies some of the ads that have been going up, not just from your own campaign directly, John, but 527s and other organizations that make some pretty tough accusations, well, I don't mind being attacked for the next three weeks.	0
ClaimBuster	1789	I worked 12 years very hard as a governor on the real problems of real people.	1
ClaimBuster	1790	How do you get anything done when you've got all of these political action committees, all of these thousands of registered lobbyists -- 40,000 registered lobbyists, 23,000 special interest groups -- and the list goes on and on and on.	1
ClaimBuster	1791	I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in -- in the United States of America and create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	1792	And that's a whole lot different from these fellows running up and down the halls whispering in their ears now and promising campaign funds for the next election if they do it.	0
ClaimBuster	1793	And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what's at stake in this election.	0
ClaimBuster	1794	I did support the '76 measure that he told about, because we were in a deep recession and we needed some stimulation.	1
ClaimBuster	1795	I will fight for your families and I will work every single day to make sure that America continues to be the greatest nation on earth.	0
ClaimBuster	1796	I just want to make sure that, I think I was supposed to get that last answer, but I want to point out that that I don't believe...	0
ClaimBuster	1797	I've recommended that our doctors be given a set of national practice guidelines and that if they follow those guidelines that raises the presumption that they didn't do anything wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	1798	You were totally in favor of it.	1
ClaimBuster	1799	I respect the President; I respect the Presidency, and I think he knows that.	0
ClaimBuster	1800	See, the card, it'll have a period of time attached to it.	0
ClaimBuster	1801	The entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	1802	Then you said we should.	1
ClaimBuster	1803	To me, that's the best way to secure America.	0
ClaimBuster	1804	We have preserved the safety net for the people with true need in this country, and it has been pure demagoguery that we have in some way shut off all the charitable programs or many of them for the people who have real need.	0
ClaimBuster	1805	I came away convinced that, if we worked at it, if we were ready to work and letting Hans Blix do his job and thoroughly go through the inspections, that if push came to shove, they'd be there with us.	0
ClaimBuster	1806	Maybe that was the purpose.	0
ClaimBuster	1807	The place where we've seen manufacturing go has been China.	1
ClaimBuster	1808	But have no doubt that Russia's behavior is certainly outside the norms of behavior that we would expect for nations which are very wealthy, as Russia has become, because of their petro dollars.	0
ClaimBuster	1809	We just have a different philosophy.	0
ClaimBuster	1810	But let's not go back to that-what they call supply management and production control, that'll simply price us out of the international market.	0
ClaimBuster	1811	We tried to overturn it in the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	1812	But not due to his policies.	0
ClaimBuster	1813	And the people of Serbia know that they can escape all those sanctions if this guy is turned out of power.	0
ClaimBuster	1814	And I think first you should -- I should understand that the question on your mind is do I understand your problem.	0
ClaimBuster	1815	There were many days that passed before we knew whether this was a spontaneous demonstration, or actually whether it was a terrorist attack.	0
ClaimBuster	1816	These terrorists are serious, they're deadly, and they know nothing except trying to kill.	0
ClaimBuster	1817	And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they don't want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements.	1
ClaimBuster	1818	The record is pretty clear in Arkansas, when you were governor.	1
ClaimBuster	1819	I think it's such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration.	1
ClaimBuster	1820	I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough.	1
ClaimBuster	1821	We try to help people with disabilities.	0
ClaimBuster	1822	And it seems to me that if you take a look, are you better off?	0
ClaimBuster	1823	Well, it's been a privilege to be able to talk to the American people tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	1824	I think it's accurate to say that in uh - two years ago when Mr. Nixon - Mr. Ford put in this uh amnesty that three times as many deserters were uh - excused as were - as were the uh - the ones who evaded the draft.	1
ClaimBuster	1825	I suggest that if Formosa is attacked or the Pescadores, or if there's any military action in any area which indicates an attack on Formosa and the Pescadores, then of course the United States is at war to defend its treaty.	0
ClaimBuster	1826	I do not suggest that Mr. Nixon does in any way.	0
ClaimBuster	1827	And I believe this Administration has not met its responsibilities in the last eight years, that our power relative to that of the Communists is declining, that we're facing a very hazardous time in the sixties, and unless the United States begin to move here - unless we start to go ahead - I don't believe that we're going to meet our responsibility to our own people or to the cause of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	1828	He still will not admit that he was wrong about the strategy of the surge in Iraq, and that's the same kind of strategy of go out and secure and hold and allow people to live normal lives.	0
ClaimBuster	1829	The jobs the president is creating pay $9,000 less than the jobs that we're losing.	1
ClaimBuster	1830	No child should be left behind in America.	0
ClaimBuster	1831	I think it's the tone.	0
ClaimBuster	1832	I think that the next president immediately after his election should sit down with the President, work out a timetable, and - get a decision on this before January of next year.	0
ClaimBuster	1833	The Senate was right because they knew the lesson of history.	0
ClaimBuster	1834	And for us to be able to make sure that they've got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids.	0
ClaimBuster	1835	And I finally -- I thought I didn't understand it -- called all the experts, and they said, oh, it'll be disruptive for 12 to 15 years.	1
ClaimBuster	1836	But what's really important here is to understand all the interplay.	0
ClaimBuster	1837	This is not a Wall Street tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	1838	And I think his present position is he would not do so, and if that's true I'm grateful for it.	0
ClaimBuster	1839	And let me tell you...	0
ClaimBuster	1840	I think we're ready to move.	0
ClaimBuster	1841	You've seen, as middle-income people in this country, incomes go down $4,300 a family, even as gasoline prices have gone up $2,000.	1
ClaimBuster	1842	I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.	0
ClaimBuster	1843	But more than that, they are role models.	0
ClaimBuster	1844	To leave this rather in the air, that we will defend it under some conditions but not under other, I think is a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	1845	I think it is good.	0
ClaimBuster	1846	I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS.	1
ClaimBuster	1847	And I haven't got time to answer with regard to the disabled.	0
ClaimBuster	1848	We have to make sure this program is there for the long term.	0
ClaimBuster	1849	Then out of that debate, with leadership, comes consensus.	0
ClaimBuster	1850	They are historic, they are strong, and they are enduring.	0
ClaimBuster	1851	But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees.	0
ClaimBuster	1852	And so I would hope that Senator Kennedy in his answer today would clear it up.	0
ClaimBuster	1853	And Colin Powell helped set up that summit.	1
ClaimBuster	1854	I think in many ways this election is more important than any since 1932, or certainly almost any in this century.	0
ClaimBuster	1855	You get to defer your taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	1856	So I know what it's like to have to look welfare head-on.	0
ClaimBuster	1857	The White House did not uh - prevent the release of that report.	1
ClaimBuster	1858	Look, as I travel around the country, this is the issue that will break your heart over and over again.	0
ClaimBuster	1859	And I favor the death penalty.	0
ClaimBuster	1860	We've had a 73% increase in the allotment of Federal funds for improved education.	1
ClaimBuster	1861	I have fought against special interests.	1
ClaimBuster	1862	And I think the American people understand it hasn't worked.	0
ClaimBuster	1863	I think it -- that we have a safer nation, but we are a long way from safe.	0
ClaimBuster	1864	One is the Middle East, and that is of interest to the whole Western World and the industrialized nations, because of the great supply of energy upon which so many depend there.	0
ClaimBuster	1865	Senator Obama, your argument for standing up to the leadership of your party isn't very convincing.	0
ClaimBuster	1866	She understands that better than almost any American that I know.	0
ClaimBuster	1867	I want the future of this country to be as bright and brilliant as its past, and it can be if we have the courage to change.	0
ClaimBuster	1868	They're going to have to make the decision themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	1869	Our schools are now better.	0
ClaimBuster	1870	When it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question.	0
ClaimBuster	1871	"And I believe the answer to that has to also be ""yes.''"	0
ClaimBuster	1872	I know many of her donors.	0
ClaimBuster	1873	That just happened, and many more are coming.	1
ClaimBuster	1874	George, we have supply management today under the 1985 bill.	1
ClaimBuster	1875	We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.	1
ClaimBuster	1876	But I also see a tremendous opportunity now to negotiate with the Soviet Union to build on the progress that we've made with the INF Treaty, which I strongly supported and most Democrats did to get those reductions in strategic weapons, to get a test ban treaty, and to really make progress on the reduction of conventional forces in Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	1877	Now we've got three of them.	1
ClaimBuster	1878	We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses.	1
ClaimBuster	1879	And I appreciate that question.	0
ClaimBuster	1880	That's a scare tactic, because it's not that many.	0
ClaimBuster	1881	We are a goldfish bowl before the world.	0
ClaimBuster	1882	And what I've proposed, you'll hear Senator McCain say, well, he's proposing a whole bunch of new spending, but actually I'm cutting more than I'm spending so that it will be a net spending cut.	1
ClaimBuster	1883	Most people want to see their own doctor.	0
ClaimBuster	1884	And under the plan that I've proposed, 80% of all family farms will be completely exempt from the estate tax.	1
ClaimBuster	1885	About fourteen to fifteen thousand did take advantage of that program.	1
ClaimBuster	1886	Well, that's what a President's supposed to know -- where those weapons are going to be.	0
ClaimBuster	1887	You go to your own pharmacy and then Medicare pays half the price.	1
ClaimBuster	1888	And this means more than what we've been doing.	0
ClaimBuster	1889	He said he voted for the $87 billion, and voted against it right before he voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	1890	Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable.	0
ClaimBuster	1891	And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don't want the cease-fire anymore.	1
ClaimBuster	1892	I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.	1
ClaimBuster	1893	If you own the land, every day is Earth Day.	0
ClaimBuster	1894	But as we learned in the same report I quoted, Saddam Hussein was gaming the oil-for-food program to get rid of sanctions.	1
ClaimBuster	1895	It took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group.	0
ClaimBuster	1896	They didn't go over to coddle.	0
ClaimBuster	1897	The question which we have to decide as Americans - are we doing enough today?	0
ClaimBuster	1898	And did the person have full access to the courts of law?	0
ClaimBuster	1899	Well, it's a great concern of mine and I think of all Americans, and perhaps the vice president can tell us what's been going on.	0
ClaimBuster	1900	Will women's rights be protected?	0
ClaimBuster	1901	Nobody's been luckier than I've been, all the way across the spectrum, and the greatest riches of all are my wife and children.	0
ClaimBuster	1902	We've got to give them the wherewithal to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	1903	This nation is the hope of the earth.	0
ClaimBuster	1904	But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	1905	Let's have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you.	0
ClaimBuster	1906	If I were President, I would also now take a look at the hundreds of Federal regulations which discriminate against women and which go right on while everyone is looking for an amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	1907	That's the way we leave it.	0
ClaimBuster	1908	Now, Senator McCain has a different kind of approach.	1
ClaimBuster	1909	Again, this is just a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	1910	Thirdly, one of the reasons why there's still high cost in medicine is because this is -- they don't use any information technology.	1
ClaimBuster	1911	We've done a long way working together to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	1912	And there was no demonstration involved.	1
ClaimBuster	1913	You get a catastrophic plan to help you on it.	0
ClaimBuster	1914	I know others disagree with it.	0
ClaimBuster	1915	Will we be better off if we start this star wars escalation into the heavens?	0
ClaimBuster	1916	Look, that's where World War I started in the Balkans.	1
ClaimBuster	1917	It's going to be tough fighting.	0
ClaimBuster	1918	And I think they deserve a family and medical leave act.	0
ClaimBuster	1919	And we have an opportunity now with improved transportation systems and improved loading facilities in our ports, to see a very good opportunity on a world international market, to replace OPEC oil with American coal as a basic energy source.	1
ClaimBuster	1920	That's not what we are going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	1921	But let's be clear: Earmarks account for $18 billion in last year's budget.	1
ClaimBuster	1922	Why I disagree with the MX is that it's a sitting duck.	0
ClaimBuster	1923	But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states.	1
ClaimBuster	1924	But the most important thing to relieve the pressure on all of the armed forces is frankly to run a foreign policy that recognizes that America is strongest when we are working with real alliances, when we are sharing the burdens of the world by working through our statesmanship at the highest levels and our diplomacy to bring other nations to our side.	0
ClaimBuster	1925	Thank you very much to the university, again.	0
ClaimBuster	1926	I represented upstate New York.	1
ClaimBuster	1927	I came from very modest means.	1
ClaimBuster	1928	The Vice President ignored them.	1
ClaimBuster	1929	I've got a strategy for the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	1930	I'm also going to talk -- respond to what you asked, Cheryl, at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	1931	First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.	0
ClaimBuster	1932	Fifty times we deployed troops around the world.	1
ClaimBuster	1933	But we will defend the citizens of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	1934	You've got about a million right here in Arizona, just shy, 950,000, who have no health insurance at all.	1
ClaimBuster	1935	There is a lot of blame to go around.	0
ClaimBuster	1936	That's one of the main reasons that we've had such an increase in the number of people employed.	1
ClaimBuster	1937	The right course for us is to make sure that we go after the -- the people who are leaders of these various anti-American groups and these -- these jihadists, but also help the Muslim world.	0
ClaimBuster	1938	We owe you a debt we can never repay you.	0
ClaimBuster	1939	And our ability to serve as an honest broker is something that we need to shepherd.	0
ClaimBuster	1940	Not only -- Even if we get all $700 billion back, let's assume the markets recover, we're holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit.	1
ClaimBuster	1941	You know, the vice president says he wants to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers, and yet his administration has a federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the country, which gave last year 7,000 furloughs to drug traffickers and drug pushers, the same people that he says he now wants to execute.	1
ClaimBuster	1942	You've got to reassert your ownership in this country and you've got to completely reform our government.	0
ClaimBuster	1943	And, no, I never proposed any $20 billion should come out of Medicare; I have proposed that the program we must treat with that particular problem.	1
ClaimBuster	1944	Off-road diesel engines -- we have reached an agreement to reduce pollution from off-road diesel engines by 90 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	1945	So we are peacemakers and we're peacekeepers.	0
ClaimBuster	1946	First of all, when we and our allies -- the Italians, the French, and the United Kingdom -- went into Lebanon, we went in there at the request of what was left of the Lebanese Government to be a stabilizing force while they tried to establish a government.	1
ClaimBuster	1947	I don't think we're a declining nation.	0
ClaimBuster	1948	I am for licensing by states of new handgun purchases.	0
ClaimBuster	1949	And I told the people exactly what the Congress exactly what kind of bill I would sign.	1
ClaimBuster	1950	The difference is we've got a new policy.	1
ClaimBuster	1951	I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families.	0
ClaimBuster	1952	I agree with the president that we have to go after them and get them wherever they are.	0
ClaimBuster	1953	So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire.	1
ClaimBuster	1954	The average income in some of those countries is twenty-five dollars a year.	1
ClaimBuster	1955	It puts a hair-trigger, and it is a dangerous, destabilizing weapon.	0
ClaimBuster	1956	So I salute these things.	0
ClaimBuster	1957	We have the right approach for the future and looks at the results.	0
ClaimBuster	1958	We have a higher unemployment rate in this country than Great Britain, and West Germany.	1
ClaimBuster	1959	But I don't think we need these other systems.	0
ClaimBuster	1960	The people in Washington are good people.	0
ClaimBuster	1961	By the time Congress comes into session to go to work, have those plans ready to go in front of Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	1962	We have to stop them from leaving.	0
ClaimBuster	1963	Described under your plan, Governor Bush, states would be required to pay vouchers to students to match the vouchers so that the federal government would put up.	1
ClaimBuster	1964	I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in Europe and Italy and the Pacific for freedom in World War II have now taken over in the United States, and that they're going to put this country back to work again.	0
ClaimBuster	1965	My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies.	0
ClaimBuster	1966	But when it comes to economic policies, essentially what you're proposing is eight more years of the same thing.	0
ClaimBuster	1967	I think that uh - we should protect our commitments.	0
ClaimBuster	1968	I've seen the tough times, I know they can be better and I'll lead America to a brighter future.	0
ClaimBuster	1969	I might say too, that - that if we see that these goals cannot be reached - and I believe they're reasonable goals - then I would cut back on the rate of implement- implementation of new programs in order to accommodate a balanced budget by fiscal year '81 which is the last year of the next term.	0
ClaimBuster	1970	We need to reform it.	0
ClaimBuster	1971	He said, well, if we have them, why don't we use them, which I think is terrifying.	1
ClaimBuster	1972	First of all, Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	1973	They're going backwards on the water quality.	1
ClaimBuster	1974	That's why I'd have regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	1975	For instance, we uh - completely revised our prison system.	1
ClaimBuster	1976	I think we can say, through the Packard Commission Report and I'm very proud that David Packard, the originator of that report, is strongly supporting me.	1
ClaimBuster	1977	I'm opposed to the death penalty.	0
ClaimBuster	1978	And I intend to get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	1979	Nothing could be further from the truth.	0
ClaimBuster	1980	Well, I certainly will, because I think that's a very fair and important question.	0
ClaimBuster	1981	The challenges that we face are unprecedented.	0
ClaimBuster	1982	But what I don't like is this left wing political agenda and therefore I have to help define that and if he's unwilling to do it, if he says ideology doesn't matter, I don't agree with him.	0
ClaimBuster	1983	I voted for the balanced budget in '93 and '97.	1
ClaimBuster	1984	But Detroit is being taxed for money that, let's say, will go to Chicago, while Chicago is being taxed to help with the problems in Philadelphia.	1
ClaimBuster	1985	And I'd be happy to discuss these other issues, but I can't believe he is accusing me of getting on both sides.	1
ClaimBuster	1986	He voted to increase taxes 98 times and to bust the budget 277 times.	1
ClaimBuster	1987	Let me give you a couple of examples, I guess, of the kind of person I wouldn't pick.	0
ClaimBuster	1988	With regard to Medicare, no, but it's time for us to say that Medicare is in pretty much the same condition that Social Security was, and something is going to have to be done in the next several years to make it fiscally sound.	0
ClaimBuster	1989	I don't think there is even a race between the two, it's about our vision for America.	0
ClaimBuster	1990	My plan also says it requires a new approach in Washington, D.C.	0
ClaimBuster	1991	And I don't think that's the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term.	0
ClaimBuster	1992	And when we compare the economic progress of this country in the Truman Administration with that of the Eisenhower Administration, we find that in every index there has been a tr- great deal more performance and more progress in this Administration than in that one.	1
ClaimBuster	1993	So it's pretty clear who doesn't want a trade war.	0
ClaimBuster	1994	But, I think it's very important to measure when and where things occurred.	0
ClaimBuster	1995	But it isn't going to get the job done if we don't change K through 12.	0
ClaimBuster	1996	We didn't ask for it.	0
ClaimBuster	1997	"And I believe the people, therefore, should be asked to make up their minds not simply on the basis of, ""Vote the way your grandfather did; vote the way your mother did."""	0
ClaimBuster	1998	Secondly, if you were so opposed to the grain embargo, why did you ask the godfather of the grain embargo to be one of your top foreign policy advisers?	0
ClaimBuster	1999	John Edwards is the author of the Patients' Bill of Rights.	1
ClaimBuster	2000	And I know from my experience in many campaigns that, if Senator Obama had asked -- responded to my urgent request to sit down, and do town hall meetings, and come before the American people, we could have done at least 10 of them by now.	0
ClaimBuster	2001	What was his participation there?	0
ClaimBuster	2002	We invested in a solar company, our country.	1
ClaimBuster	2003	As far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns.	0
ClaimBuster	2004	No, I -- look, we've got to fix the system.	0
ClaimBuster	2005	We're beginning to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	2006	I think the result of this debate indicates that that fact is true.	0
ClaimBuster	2007	And yet project strength in a way that promotes freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	2008	I'm for the Stealth, I'm for the D-5, I'm for going ahead with the advance Cruise missile.	0
ClaimBuster	2009	And yet, Mr. Bush says well, I don't think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees, when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured, that have to go to that hospital.	1
ClaimBuster	2010	And that's one of the reasons why my state has cut crime by more than any other industrial state in America.	1
ClaimBuster	2011	But the real thing we got to have is a competitive economic strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	2012	I read a report, or a memo, from somebody in his 1988 campaign -- I forgot the fellow's name -- warning then Senator Gore to be careful about exaggerating claims.	1
ClaimBuster	2013	It is not enough for us simply to be the strongest nation militarily, the strongest economically, and also to have firm diplomacy.	0
ClaimBuster	2014	There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	2015	This is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries, and it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to America, long term, and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism.	1
ClaimBuster	2016	Now, once there, we could have continued those inspections.	0
ClaimBuster	2017	I got into this race because I did not want my child to grow up to be part of the first generation of Americans to do worse than her parents.	0
ClaimBuster	2018	(Laughter, applause) Isn't that the point?	0
ClaimBuster	2019	And we're the most religious people on Earth.	1
ClaimBuster	2020	Mr. Benson, testifying on the food stamp plan in 1957, said there were twenty-five million Americans who could not afford a elementary low-cost diet.	1
ClaimBuster	2021	For 200 years, we've lived in the future, believing that tomorrow would be better than today, and today would be better than yesterday.	1
ClaimBuster	2022	We have to say to our friend in China, look, you guys are playing aggressively.	0
ClaimBuster	2023	She shouldn't be allowed to run.	0
ClaimBuster	2024	It's one of the reasons why we have a drug education and prevention program that is reaching out and helping youngsters all over our state, the kind of thing I want to do as president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	2025	uh - The estimate of the outside, if you eliminated all tax shelters, is 5 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	2026	He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	2027	Prosperity is not just going to trickle down.	0
ClaimBuster	2028	We go back and look at the healthcare plan that he wanted to impose on the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	2029	Hillary, you have no idea.	0
ClaimBuster	2030	I don't believe we need a good conservative judge, and I don't believe we need a good liberal judge.	0
ClaimBuster	2031	There've been 122 community and small banks have closed since Dodd- Frank.	1
ClaimBuster	2032	So, research, speeding the drugs to market, testing, blood supply are very important elements of this.	0
ClaimBuster	2033	One last point I want to make on energy.	0
ClaimBuster	2034	We can do that, we as Americans, because we're the best innovators, we're the best producers, and 95 percent of the people who are our market live outside of the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	2035	I think we need to fully enforce the law.	0
ClaimBuster	2036	Well I think it's uh... very difficult for President Ford to uh - explain the difference between the pardon of President Nixon and - and uh - his attitude toward those who violated the draft laws.	0
ClaimBuster	2037	Their currency has dropped 80 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	2038	But Obamacare has to go.	0
ClaimBuster	2039	We never increased sales taxes or income tax or property tax.	1
ClaimBuster	2040	Well, first of all, it is just not true that I haven't met with the Black Congressional Caucus.	1
ClaimBuster	2041	And when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times.	1
ClaimBuster	2042	If it hadn't been for us, Saddam Hussein would be sitting on top of three-fifths of the oil supply of the world and he'd have nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	2043	It's between a woman, God and her doctor.	0
ClaimBuster	2044	At the American Conference - Inter-American Conference this summer, when we wanted them to join together in the denunciation of Castro and the Cuban Communists, we couldn't even get the Inter-American group to join together in denouncing Castro.	1
ClaimBuster	2045	That's what distinguishes us from the enemy.	0
ClaimBuster	2046	But if there's one thing we also understand it is that you cannot make concessions to terrorists, ever, ever.	0
ClaimBuster	2047	It's pretty clear that was a quota case, and just because one teacher was white and one black and they had the same qualifications, you know they decided who would stay there.	0
ClaimBuster	2048	We have in the Dole-Kemp economic plan, unless unless your home's worth over 500,000 dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	2049	If you're going to sell a gun illegally, you need to be arrested.	0
ClaimBuster	2050	You also provide opportunity scholarships so low income parents will have the same choice that others have in sending their children to better schools.	0
ClaimBuster	2051	But I want you to think about just 2 or 3 things.	0
ClaimBuster	2052	We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries.	0
ClaimBuster	2053	If we have more people hired, if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get back all kinds of jobs into this country, then you're going to see rising incomes again.	0
ClaimBuster	2054	And we can see that in both Lebanon and in Central America.	0
ClaimBuster	2055	How could we have not known?	0
ClaimBuster	2056	I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals.	0
ClaimBuster	2057	Jim, the question you asked, if I heard you correctly, was would he support legislation to overturn it.	0
ClaimBuster	2058	If he keeps this up, he's going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics.	0
ClaimBuster	2059	The top 1% will pay one-third of all the federal income taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	2060	Now, we also can't return to a Cold War posture with respect to Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	2061	It seems to me that you have a selective memory.	0
ClaimBuster	2062	And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.	1
ClaimBuster	2063	That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?	0
ClaimBuster	2064	And before we react, I think it's best to have the full accounting, full understanding of what's taking place.	0
ClaimBuster	2065	Mr. Bush talked about values.	0
ClaimBuster	2066	Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters.	1
ClaimBuster	2067	We have done the following things: Number one, we've managed the aftermath of the Cold War, supporting a big drop in nuclear weapons in Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	2068	I believe that all of us are going to have to begin to work together to solve our problems.	0
ClaimBuster	2069	It's now 121/4, and I predict it'll be coming down a little more shortly.	1
ClaimBuster	2070	Number two, we've got to take care of this missile situation and try to get the nuclear war behind us and give this thing very high priority.	0
ClaimBuster	2071	President Clinton came to California in 1992.	1
ClaimBuster	2072	It's going to grow at a record rate of growth.	0
ClaimBuster	2073	The Ford administration will not let down, will not eliminate or forget our obligation to the people of Taiwan.	0
ClaimBuster	2074	I talk about the millions of people -- tell you one other thing.	0
ClaimBuster	2075	You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power.	1
ClaimBuster	2076	I sold them my remaining shares.	1
ClaimBuster	2077	It's a lot of money to protect other people.	0
ClaimBuster	2078	We still rank fifteenth among all the nations of the world in infant mortality.	1
ClaimBuster	2079	-- we haven't had the leadership in Washington to work on a bipartisan basis.	0
ClaimBuster	2080	And there's an enormous undone job to protect the loose nuclear materials in the world that are able to get to terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	2081	And there are a number of things.	0
ClaimBuster	2082	It was laughed at all over the world what happened.	0
ClaimBuster	2083	Now, Alan Greenspan, who I think has done a terrific job in monetary policy, supports the president's tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	2084	And I know they say it doesn't rank anywhere on the polls.	1
ClaimBuster	2085	We took our eye off the ball.	0
ClaimBuster	2086	Now, if that's true, just tell me now.	0
ClaimBuster	2087	If less money is coming in, you end up making cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	2088	"I didn't hear the word ""liberal"" or ""left"" one time."	0
ClaimBuster	2089	And they have not got it done.	1
ClaimBuster	2090	I know what's happened over the course of the past eight years.	0
ClaimBuster	2091	I'm ready to go at it right now.	1
ClaimBuster	2092	Well, folks, we got one, and that one is a financial crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	2093	"And when you looked into the camera in a debate with Senator Clinton and said, ""I will sit down and negotiate with John McCain about public financing before I make a decision,"" you didn't tell the American people the truth because you didn't."	1
ClaimBuster	2094	But understand this: We also have to look at where some of our tax revenues are going.	0
ClaimBuster	2095	And I understand that in certain capitals around the world that that wasn't a popular move.	0
ClaimBuster	2096	I think we have to demonstrate to the people of the world that we're determined in this free country of ours to be first - not first if, and not first but, and not first when - but first.	0
ClaimBuster	2097	Recycle those proceeds, then, back into the pockets of the American workers by reducing their tax payments.	0
ClaimBuster	2098	But I believe we have to have some way of checking hand guns before they're sold, to check the criminal history, the mental health history, and the age of people who are buying them.	0
ClaimBuster	2099	The plane wasn't flying the way it was supposed to be; it was a waste of money.	1
ClaimBuster	2100	No, you are the one that's unfit.	0
ClaimBuster	2101	Second, as we consider this problem of unemployment, we have to realize where it is.	0
ClaimBuster	2102	A lot of people, including me, said, look, it's not doing what it should do.	1
ClaimBuster	2103	But I think we need to be very careful in the present situation before we invite the Russians to play the lead role in mediating.	0
ClaimBuster	2104	Jim, I -- you may want to move onto another topic, but I -- I would just say this to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	2105	But on his very optimistic figures about his tax cut producing a balanced budget by 1983, and the fact that he is using, he says, the figures of the Senate Budget Committee, that Senate Budget Committee Report does not accommodate all of the Reagan defense plans.	1
ClaimBuster	2106	But until we're strong here, until we're moving here, I believe a summit could not be successful.	0
ClaimBuster	2107	This is what a president has to do.	0
ClaimBuster	2108	I think part of the answer to this haunting of these children that are out there and suffering lies in extension of Medicaid, to challenge the states, and maybe we're going to have to enforce more on the states in terms of Medicaid taking care of these.	0
ClaimBuster	2109	We didn't guard the borders.	0
ClaimBuster	2110	I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time.	1
ClaimBuster	2111	And if we did that, we'd have more consumption ability in America, which is what we need right now in order to kick our economy into gear.	0
ClaimBuster	2112	So what happened was we got distracted, we diverted resources, and ultimately bin Laden escaped, set up base camps in the mountains of Pakistan in the northwest provinces there.	1
ClaimBuster	2113	I feel very strongly the same place.	0
ClaimBuster	2114	There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	2115	But my economic program is the kind of change we want.	0
ClaimBuster	2116	And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	2117	There isn't any such thing as something free out there.	0
ClaimBuster	2118	May I disagree with the premise of your question?	0
ClaimBuster	2119	And so they're looking for ways to satisfy their desire for a better life and still reduce pollution at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	2120	That's what America's all about.	0
ClaimBuster	2121	"I'm running to be a president who happens to be Catholic. """	1
ClaimBuster	2122	I said I'd end the war in Libya -- in -- in Iraq, and I did.	1
ClaimBuster	2123	And all of these things are going to have to be addressed.	0
ClaimBuster	2124	And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson.	1
ClaimBuster	2125	And now we have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age to ban weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	2126	Where I part with the President is that despite all of those differences we must, as past Presidents before this one have done, meet on the common ground of survival.	0
ClaimBuster	2127	By far, the largest number in American history -- not just the big ones you read about, but a lot of smaller ones.	1
ClaimBuster	2128	So I think you're right and I hope the rest of the night belongs to you.	0
ClaimBuster	2129	And we've got a lot of work to do.	0
ClaimBuster	2130	And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we're also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy.	0
ClaimBuster	2131	I can see how tough that terrain is.	0
ClaimBuster	2132	By adequate preparation I mean that at that level we must prepare an agenda, an agenda agreed upon with the approval of the heads of state involved.	0
ClaimBuster	2133	In the last few years government has gotten bigger and bigger; industry has gotten larger and larger; labor unions have gotten bigger and bigger; and our children have been the victims of mass education.	0
ClaimBuster	2134	Tipper and I were good friends with Mel and Randy, and I know that all of us here want to extend our sympathy and condolences to Jean and the family and to the Sifford family.	1
ClaimBuster	2135	"Ann yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, ""Ann, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs."	1
ClaimBuster	2136	I understand there's great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions.	0
ClaimBuster	2137	Well I'm glad you asked.	0
ClaimBuster	2138	We've got a pilot program.	1
ClaimBuster	2139	About a thousand raised their hands.	1
ClaimBuster	2140	We also believe that in the great field of ideals that we can lead America to the victory for freedom - victory in the newly developing countries, victory also in the captive countries - provided we have faith in ourselves and faith in our principles.	0
ClaimBuster	2141	You really identified one of the really major challenges that America faces.	0
ClaimBuster	2142	I want to get one with Eastern Europe; I want to get one with Chile.	0
ClaimBuster	2143	She finally gave it up.	1
ClaimBuster	2144	And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics.	0
ClaimBuster	2145	They will be my first priority, not my election year concern.	0
ClaimBuster	2146	I mean, you may be sending a signal.	0
ClaimBuster	2147	That's what she told me her husband understood.	1
ClaimBuster	2148	Is this the time to unleash our one-liners?	0
ClaimBuster	2149	And we ought to be prepared to provide those funds.	0
ClaimBuster	2150	Now, I've got to correct a little bit of Senator McCain's history, not surprisingly.	0
ClaimBuster	2151	Unfortunately, we didn't have more questions on that.	1
ClaimBuster	2152	What message does that send our troops?	0
ClaimBuster	2153	I've taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.	0
ClaimBuster	2154	We need to keep that in line.	0
ClaimBuster	2155	And Governor Bush has declared to the anti-choice groups that he will appoint justices in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who are known for being the most vigorous opponents of a woman's right to choose.	1
ClaimBuster	2156	I mean, you say we've done all these bad things, which isn't the case.	0
ClaimBuster	2157	It's just pouring and destroying their youth.	0
ClaimBuster	2158	That gets rid of the third biggest intrusion of the federal government in our economy.	1
ClaimBuster	2159	We have not been updating from the new standpoint.	1
ClaimBuster	2160	We've doubled it on research and on every other aspect of it.	1
ClaimBuster	2161	But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	2162	September the 11th changed how America must look at the world.	0
ClaimBuster	2163	He has a one-point plan.	1
ClaimBuster	2164	I'm not satisfied to have fifty percent of our steel-mill capacity unused.	1
ClaimBuster	2165	And that's why, for example, on tax policy, what I want to do is provide a middle class tax cut to 95 percent of working Americans, those who are working two jobs, people who are not spending enough time with their kids, because they are struggling to make ends meet.	0
ClaimBuster	2166	We have gone from first to thirteenth in wages in the world in the last twelve years, since Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan have been in.	1
ClaimBuster	2167	Well, let's come back and talk about the military, but all the way -- all the way through.	0
ClaimBuster	2168	It didn't look good the first two years when we had a Democratic president and Ã‚ Democratic Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	2169	When I was running -- when we had the debate in 2000, never dreamt I'd be doing that.	0
ClaimBuster	2170	I've devoted in the budget I've proposed, as I said last week, more than twice as much as the governor has proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	2171	Come on, that's not leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	2172	I'm not going to increase taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	2173	She's the 36th student in that classroom.	1
ClaimBuster	2174	This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make.	0
ClaimBuster	2175	Now that, of course, is just one factor, but it's a significant one.	0
ClaimBuster	2176	I sure stopped their budget.	1
ClaimBuster	2177	It would still have gone up as much as it has, and the $.50 would be added on top of that.	1
ClaimBuster	2178	You work harder and harder to make ends meet and put food on the table.	0
ClaimBuster	2179	They inform on the bad guys.	0
ClaimBuster	2180	And in exchange, if the states want to -- they're not forced to, they can choose to -- they cover individuals up to 300 percent of poverty.	1
ClaimBuster	2181	But he ought to apologize for wanting to take more and more.	0
ClaimBuster	2182	None of them ever get implemented because -- let me give you an example.	0
ClaimBuster	2183	We not only fixed Medicare and took it way out into the future, we did something that you don't know how to do: We balanced the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	2184	And so what I've done throughout my presidency and will continue to do is, number one, make sure that these countries are supporting our counterterrorism efforts.	1
ClaimBuster	2185	This has already passed the House, and it has an excellent prospect to pass the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	2186	I want a smaller and smarter government.	0
ClaimBuster	2187	I say it all the time.	0
ClaimBuster	2188	I've reached the conclusion that the Soviet Union is actually filibustering.	0
ClaimBuster	2189	In fact, what, Joe, if you want to do the right thing with your employees and you want to provide them health insurance, we'll give you a 50 percent credit so that you will actually be able to afford it.	0
ClaimBuster	2190	See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president.	0
ClaimBuster	2191	This is a responsibility of the president.	0
ClaimBuster	2192	I did avoid, I'm afraid, in my previous answer, also, the idea of uneven, yes.	0
ClaimBuster	2193	And I know he keeps saying, you want to take Detroit bankrupt.	1
ClaimBuster	2194	So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge.	0
ClaimBuster	2195	I think we should go back to Geneva, who's ever elected president, Mr. Nixon or myself, and try once again.	0
ClaimBuster	2196	So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.	0
ClaimBuster	2197	The Soviet Union sat at the table knowing that we had gone forward with unilateral concessions without any reciprocation from them whatsoever.	0
ClaimBuster	2198	He says don't do it, but the policies he's expounding of putting conditions on M.F.N.	1
ClaimBuster	2199	I believe that we need to export more so I'll keep working for export agreements where we can sell more abroad and I believe that we must strengthen the family.	0
ClaimBuster	2200	And I suspect, given his record, he's going to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	2201	Because of the uh - great -ly- greatly uh - advantaged uh - tho- per - persons who live in the suburbs, better education, better organization, more articulate, more aware of what the laws are, quite often this money has been channeled out of the downtown centers where it's needed.	0
ClaimBuster	2202	Uh - I can only say that my experience is there for the people to consider; Senator Kennedy's is there for the people to consider.	0
ClaimBuster	2203	Thank the University of Massachusetts and Mr. Vice President, thank you.	0
ClaimBuster	2204	Thank you, Carole, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen.	0
ClaimBuster	2205	I think these -- these actions taken by a president and a leader have symbolic significance and perhaps even material significance in that you'd hope that during that time we could call in the people who were actually eyewitnesses.	1
ClaimBuster	2206	When they had a 250 billion dollar tax scheme, that is half the size of this one.	1
ClaimBuster	2207	I prefer to take the overall percentage record of the last twenty years of the Democrats and the eight years of the Republicans to show an overall period of growth.	0
ClaimBuster	2208	Well, I believe that we did the appropriate thing under the circumstances.	0
ClaimBuster	2209	I've just finished reading a book, I think it's called -- what is it called, what is it, The Demise of the Democratic Party by Ronald Cardash (ph) or something talking about all the liberal influences in the administration.	1
ClaimBuster	2210	I believe America's best days are ahead of us.	0
ClaimBuster	2211	But as Senator Clinton said in her debates with you, we need to know the full extent of that relationship.	1
ClaimBuster	2212	My thanks to the League of Women Voters, to the panelists, the moderator, and to the people of Kansas City for their warm hospitality and greeting.	0
ClaimBuster	2213	I think it can only be that they're anticipating or hope -- expecting, not hoping, that maybe we don't have a control of inflation and it's going to go back up again.	0
ClaimBuster	2214	Of course we're doing everything we can to protect America.	0
ClaimBuster	2215	If we're saving money and managing resources better, that's a good thing.	0
ClaimBuster	2216	Jim, you permitted Mr. Bush to break the rules, he said, to defend the honor of the country.	1
ClaimBuster	2217	I said we'd transition out of Afghanistan, and start making sure that Afghans are responsible for their own security, that's what I'm doing.	1
ClaimBuster	2218	Well, when I got to be a part of the current administration, it was right after -- I was one of the few members of my political party to support former President Bush in the Persian Gulf War resolution, and at the end of that war, for whatever reason, it was not finished in a way that removed Saddam Hussein from power.	1
ClaimBuster	2219	Well, I'm not for registration.	0
ClaimBuster	2220	You've got to free up the private sector.	0
ClaimBuster	2221	Is that a new question or a 30-second question?	0
ClaimBuster	2222	Here are the key ingredients.	0
ClaimBuster	2223	And the American people don't have the slightest clue about what President Reagan will do about these deficits.	0
ClaimBuster	2224	If we don't get the economy to grow, if we don't cut taxes, and give people child credits, and cut the capital gains rate, and get this economy growing, we're going to limp into the next century.	0
ClaimBuster	2225	Do you think that our political institutions are working the way they should when literally only half of our citizens vote?	1
ClaimBuster	2226	What I object to -- [applause] -- what I object to -- what I object to is someone seeking to use his faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose it on others.	0
ClaimBuster	2227	Well, I think I should respond, because -- so ridiculous.	0
ClaimBuster	2228	And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.	0
ClaimBuster	2229	Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America.	1
ClaimBuster	2230	In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel.	1
ClaimBuster	2231	You're right, what does matter is a plan.	0
ClaimBuster	2232	Mr. Cronkite, I naturally am aware of it, because I, of course, pay attention to everything Senator Kennedy says, as well as Senator Fulbright.	0
ClaimBuster	2233	So it's the obligation of the president to do just that, and I intend to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	2234	I think the Communists have been moving with vigor - Laos, Africa, Cuba - all around the world today they're on the move.	0
ClaimBuster	2235	I have a plan to cover all Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	2236	I think it's an idea that would rip our country apart.	0
ClaimBuster	2237	So that's on the record.	0
ClaimBuster	2238	And it was terminated by current mayor.	1
ClaimBuster	2239	Now, another big difference is Governor Bush is proposing to open up some of our most precious environmental treasures, like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for the big oil companies to go in and start producing oil there.	1
ClaimBuster	2240	And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they're stuck.	0
ClaimBuster	2241	What should I have done?	0
ClaimBuster	2242	China and India are graduating more graduates in technology and science than we are.	1
ClaimBuster	2243	Well, maybe we bit off more than we could chew, but we're pursuing a step-by-step reform now.	0
ClaimBuster	2244	You don't muddle through stamping out the Taliban.	0
ClaimBuster	2245	Our troops have performed brilliantly.	0
ClaimBuster	2246	Yes, we tried, and, yes, we failed to bring him into the family of nations; he had the 4th largest army.	1
ClaimBuster	2247	Recently on a television program, he said it exceed our wildest expectations.	1
ClaimBuster	2248	We've created, and I'm not aiming at any one person here, I'm aiming at our government -- nobody takes responsibility for anything.	0
ClaimBuster	2249	We're actually drilling more on public lands than in the previous administration and my -- the previous president was an oil man.	1
ClaimBuster	2250	I want you to be on my team.	1
ClaimBuster	2251	I want to bring it back and get back good jobs and rising take-home pay.	0
ClaimBuster	2252	One seventh the total economy, 17 new taxes, price controls, 35 to 50 new bureaucracies that cost $1.5 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	2253	It's not a grand diversion.	0
ClaimBuster	2254	Yes, I mean, he's got a record.	0
ClaimBuster	2255	We do not have to go on sharing in scarcity with the country getting worse off, with unemployment growing.	0
ClaimBuster	2256	If you have time, go through Nexis and Lexis, pull all the old news articles, look at what Ambassador Glaspie said all through the fall and what-have-you, and then look at what she and Kelly and all the others in State said at the end when they were trying to clean it up.	0
ClaimBuster	2257	Now, we've seen 30 consecutive -- 31 consecutive months of job growth; 5.2 million new jobs created.	1
ClaimBuster	2258	It's how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot.	1
ClaimBuster	2259	Our allies feel that we've neglected them.	0
ClaimBuster	2260	We're going to have to coordinate with other countries to make sure that whatever actions we take work.	0
ClaimBuster	2261	The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people in the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened.	1
ClaimBuster	2262	Third thing I think we need is more forums like this, which is one of the reasons I have so strongly supported campaign finance reform.	0
ClaimBuster	2263	I think everybody's paying too much taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	2264	Well, I'm glad you raised that question.	0
ClaimBuster	2265	Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	2266	They currently favor going forward with a runoff election.	1
ClaimBuster	2267	We are going to have to make the Iraqi government start taking more responsibility, withdraw our troops in a responsible way over time, because we're going to have to put some additional troops in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	2268	Two hundred years ago, Tom Paine, when the 13 tiny colonies were trying to become a nation, said, we have it in our power to begin the world over again.	1
ClaimBuster	2269	Because you have nothing to say.	0
ClaimBuster	2270	Whether we're going to give our families more protection for their kids against drugs and tobacco and gangs and guns.	0
ClaimBuster	2271	My dad was born in Mexico of American parents; Ann's dad was born in Wales and is a first-generation American.	1
ClaimBuster	2272	And more recently, he talks about cutting the defense budget by five to seven billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	2273	The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship.	1
ClaimBuster	2274	He was a justice on the Supreme Court of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	2275	And the greatest repayment I can ever give is to recreate the American dream for your children and grandchildren.	0
ClaimBuster	2276	It's not just movies; television, video games, music, the Internet.	0
ClaimBuster	2277	And I have no apologies for our going on a peace mission.	0
ClaimBuster	2278	I would prefer that none of us had to pay taxes, including myself.	0
ClaimBuster	2279	A lot of my -- excuse me, Anderson -- a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed.	1
ClaimBuster	2280	And I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track.	0
ClaimBuster	2281	We welcome legal immigrants into this country.	0
ClaimBuster	2282	I know what it's like to have to fight to keep one's hope going through difficult times.	0
ClaimBuster	2283	And while I was there I worked on a bipartisan basis, as I did in the House, I worked with former President Reagan on the modernization of our strategic weaponry.	1
ClaimBuster	2284	The fa- the farmer who grows wheat gets about two and a half cents out of a twenty-five-cent loaf of bread.	1
ClaimBuster	2285	And plus, we cut taxes for everybody.	1
ClaimBuster	2286	With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb.	1
ClaimBuster	2287	He believes in the freedom of the Iraqi people.	1
ClaimBuster	2288	He says he's going to give you all a $5,000 tax credit.	1
ClaimBuster	2289	Our country has cut the welfare rolls in half.	1
ClaimBuster	2290	No, I'm not proud of that.	0
ClaimBuster	2291	We've had uh - Republican presidents before who've tried to run against a Democratic - uh Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	2292	I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul.	0
ClaimBuster	2293	I think you know because you've covered these issues, that there's no way that we can build all of the weapons the Vice President says he wants to build within the defense budget.	1
ClaimBuster	2294	"I, I still remember a woman that I met ten years ago who said she wanted to get off welfare so her kids could tell, give an answer when they say, ""What does your mother do for a job?"""	1
ClaimBuster	2295	Consider the distance between ourselves and -- and Israel, the president said that -- that he was going to put daylight between us and Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	2296	Now let me just tell you a little story.	0
ClaimBuster	2297	We really need to nail down the big intercontinental ballistic missiles, the ones that can hit us from Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	2298	And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody's ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you're never going to be able to use it.	1
ClaimBuster	2299	You also have investments outside the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	2300	Now, I believe that you can take that position and not be pro- abortion, but you have to afford people their constitutional rights.	0
ClaimBuster	2301	What we have to do, and this is the crux of the matter, is to make it very, very uh - difficult for a person who uses a gun in the commission of a crime to stay out of jail.	0
ClaimBuster	2302	I completely respect their views.	0
ClaimBuster	2303	To involve them in the administration of government and the feeling that they belong to the societal structure that makes decisions in the judiciary and in the executive branch is a very important commitment which I am trying to realize and will continue to do so in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	2304	So some may be better off.	0
ClaimBuster	2305	They feel we have to have strong borders.	0
ClaimBuster	2306	Most people are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	2307	You raise taxes and you kill jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	2308	I recognize that taking Saddam Hussein out was unpopular.	0
ClaimBuster	2309	That's one major war explosion in a warhead.	0
ClaimBuster	2310	I'd like to thank the hundreds of executives who came to Chicago, a third of them Republicans, who said they wanted to change.	1
ClaimBuster	2311	Well, where are the papers?	0
ClaimBuster	2312	The highest unemployment of any developed nation of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	2313	We're living in a new world after the Cold War, and what works in this new world is not trickle down, not government for the benefit of the privileged few, not tax and spend, but a commitment to invest in American jobs and American education, controlling American health care costs, and bringing the American people together.	0
ClaimBuster	2314	Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.	0
ClaimBuster	2315	I love the people here.	0
ClaimBuster	2316	And I don't have a list, but I think the appointments that the President has made to the Bench have been outstanding, outstanding appointments.	0
ClaimBuster	2317	But it's the right move not to join a foreign court that could -- where our people could be prosecuted.	0
ClaimBuster	2318	Let me come back and -- and answer your question.	0
ClaimBuster	2319	And to this day, not one of its decisions or rulings has ever been challenged.	1
ClaimBuster	2320	I think we ought to do plastic surgery on a lot of these guys so that they're all ears, too, and listen to you.	0
ClaimBuster	2321	Government does not create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	2322	In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions.	0
ClaimBuster	2323	You were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going to increase his taxes, which was going to cause him not to be able to employ people, which Joe was trying to realize the American dream.	1
ClaimBuster	2324	But when you're in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	2325	Governor Reagan says that this is not a good achievement, and he blames restraints on coal production on regulations - regulations that affect the life and the health and safety of miners, and also regulations that protect the purity of our air and the quality our water and our land.	1
ClaimBuster	2326	We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s.	1
ClaimBuster	2327	I personally don't believe that the federal government oughta finance abortions, but I - I draw the line and don't support a constitutional amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	2328	Were ready to go to work at the state and local level, all of us.	0
ClaimBuster	2329	One is to speed up generic drugs to the marketplace, quicker.	0
ClaimBuster	2330	We have made it less attractive for enterprises to stay here than to go offshore from time to time.	0
ClaimBuster	2331	Doing everything we can to control our own energy.	0
ClaimBuster	2332	Prime Minister Rabin gave his life because someone in his own country literally hated him for trying to bring peace.	0
ClaimBuster	2333	An all-volunteer army is best suited to fight the new wars of the 21st century, which is to be specialized and to find these people as they hide around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	2334	And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	2335	Because we've got a lot of people advocating we don't want to put our money into Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	2336	And we got some very good Republican women running.	1
ClaimBuster	2337	And that's why this enormous national debt, engineered by this administration, is harming these countries in fueling this immigration.	1
ClaimBuster	2338	And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability.	0
ClaimBuster	2339	We're doing it faster than any other state our size, comparable state.	1
ClaimBuster	2340	And in those two cases, I would favor them.	0
ClaimBuster	2341	I've been critical of this Administration and I've been critical of the President.	0
ClaimBuster	2342	The key is to control the cost and maintain the quality.	0
ClaimBuster	2343	And that means keeping our military strong.	0
ClaimBuster	2344	Finally, let me say this: as far as prestige is concerned, the first place it would show up would be in the United Nations.	0
ClaimBuster	2345	We've got to get the support of the people of -- of Pakistan.	0
ClaimBuster	2346	First of all, I'm going through from the very beginning -- we're going to cut about 5 percent of the discretionary budget, excluding military.	0
ClaimBuster	2347	And I hope we get a chance to talk about this more.	0
ClaimBuster	2348	And in my state I'm proud to say we've organized a drug education and prevention program which the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration says is a model for the country.	1
ClaimBuster	2349	(LAUGHTER) I am a person who keeps promises.	0
ClaimBuster	2350	I don't think we need 150,000 troops.	0
ClaimBuster	2351	Take it and get anywhere in America the health care that you wish.	0
ClaimBuster	2352	I think it's important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America, that we change our tax code to make sure that we're helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States, that we take some of the money that we're saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments.	0
ClaimBuster	2353	There's no doubt about it.	0
ClaimBuster	2354	Now look, if you want someone who will spend a lot of words describing a whole convoluted process and then end up supporting legislation that is supported by the big drug companies, this is your man.	1
ClaimBuster	2355	Crack down on China, if and when they cheat.	0
ClaimBuster	2356	But these are important questions.	0
ClaimBuster	2357	I said they need -- these companies need to go through a managed bankruptcy.	0
ClaimBuster	2358	I want to tell her, I'll fight for a prescription drug benefit for all seniors and fight for the people of this country for a prosperity that benefits all.	0
ClaimBuster	2359	Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment?	0
ClaimBuster	2360	I don't want to kill it off by a tax increase.	0
ClaimBuster	2361	I am proud to have been part of an administration that past the first catastrophic health bill.	1
ClaimBuster	2362	We've got to pay our troops more.	0
ClaimBuster	2363	We're going to get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	2364	The rich are paying a bigger percent of the total tax burden.	1
ClaimBuster	2365	This is the fourth time this has happened -- an identical attack, in the same region, despite warnings -- even public warnings -- from the terrorists.	1
ClaimBuster	2366	I support the death penalty.	1
ClaimBuster	2367	They've had eight years to get something done on Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	2368	I did a study on it; they're cost- ineffective.	1
ClaimBuster	2369	If you commit a crime with a gun, there needs to be absolute certainty in the law.	0
ClaimBuster	2370	Getting things done in three months that my competitors took 18 months to do.	1
ClaimBuster	2371	Got to keep going until all those nuclear weapons in Russia are gone and the other republics.	0
ClaimBuster	2372	So let's just, let's give credit where credit is due.	0
ClaimBuster	2373	Will our children be better off?	0
ClaimBuster	2374	I'm talking about a national mood.	0
ClaimBuster	2375	Once again, the president is misleading America.	0
ClaimBuster	2376	And there would simply be a delay, and on the other hand, many of the people who would then be given jobs are presently wards of the Government and it wouldn't hurt to give them a tax incentive, because they... that wouldn't be costing Government anything either.	0
ClaimBuster	2377	First of all, as I say, I don't think that -- we're not going to have another Cold War with Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	2378	Your mothers and fathers did the same thing for you and others.	0
ClaimBuster	2379	And I know that everybody uh - makes mistakes.	0
ClaimBuster	2380	Now he did use uh - ill-advised words, but I think in the fact that he apologized, that he was reprimanded, uh - does permit him to stay on and continue that kind of leadership that's we so badly need as we enter into uh - negotiations uh - under the SALT II agreement, or if we have operations that might be developing uh in the Middle East or southern Africa, in the Pacific, uh - we need a man with that experience, that knowledge, that know-how, and I think, in light of the fact that he has uh - apologized, uh - would not have justified my asking for his resignation.	1
ClaimBuster	2381	In other words, it doesn't converge as the President suggests.	0
ClaimBuster	2382	Our Government, in its most sacred documents - the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and all - speak of man being created, of a Creator.	0
ClaimBuster	2383	I will defend the right of Roe v. Wade.	0
ClaimBuster	2384	That's one of the problems with this administration's so-called shuttle diplomacy.	0
ClaimBuster	2385	I believe that if in all these years that we have spent trying to get the amendment, that we had spent as much time correcting these laws, as we did in California - and we were the first to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	2386	And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.	1
ClaimBuster	2387	I used to consult to businesses -- excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers.	1
ClaimBuster	2388	But the problem is, he hasn't described what exactly we'd replace it with, other than saying we're going to leave it to the states.	1
ClaimBuster	2389	So I think probably we're making a mistake night after night after night to cast the nation's future on a unit that small.	0
ClaimBuster	2390	That's not how you bring people together.	0
ClaimBuster	2391	That's why we included in the financial package a proposal to get homeowners in a position where they can renegotiate their mortgages.	1
ClaimBuster	2392	But let me tell you where the president's policies have put us.	0
ClaimBuster	2393	To me that's how you make society the safest it can be.	0
ClaimBuster	2394	But it's an honor that we have it.	0
ClaimBuster	2395	But we used that as a role model, the way he took understandable pride in his heritage, what his family means to him.	0
ClaimBuster	2396	First of all, I do have mandatory testing.	0
ClaimBuster	2397	Because the question you ask is important.	0
ClaimBuster	2398	How can something this serious occur in an administration and have a President of the United States in a situation like this say he didn't know?	0
ClaimBuster	2399	Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.	1
ClaimBuster	2400	There isn't any question but that we will defend our rights there.	0
ClaimBuster	2401	The people have to make up their minds.	0
ClaimBuster	2402	Let me restate uh - our policy.	0
ClaimBuster	2403	It just takes - from the people.	0
ClaimBuster	2404	But what I've also said is we can't just produce traditional source of energy.	1
ClaimBuster	2405	And I think the Vice President supported the Bork nomination.	0
ClaimBuster	2406	So we need to do the reforms and the term limits.	0
ClaimBuster	2407	Because we talked about what we wanted to do.	0
ClaimBuster	2408	And we have fundamental disagreements about the use of military power and how you do it, and you just saw it in response to previous questions.	0
ClaimBuster	2409	I have seen what's happened in this last 4 years when -- in my state, when people lose their jobs there's a good chance I'll know them by their names.	0
ClaimBuster	2410	How -- why would these people stay there?	0
ClaimBuster	2411	For those what I think we need to do is to develop an investment-type vehicle that would be an incentive for them to invest, like medical savings accounts with rollover capacity.	0
ClaimBuster	2412	We don't want our kids coming back here.	0
ClaimBuster	2413	Now, that's a certain passion that in my view it's misguided passion.	0
ClaimBuster	2414	I know it'll come as a surprise to Mr. Mondale, but I am in charge.	0
ClaimBuster	2415	So at least we have time to work with it.	0
ClaimBuster	2416	Over the next four years, we'll continue to insist on excellence in every classroom in America so that our children have a chance to realize the great promise of America.	0
ClaimBuster	2417	You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year.	1
ClaimBuster	2418	Secondly, I think we need to look at making the elections more accessible.	0
ClaimBuster	2419	They have not been forthcoming.	0
ClaimBuster	2420	Let me just answer one part of the last question quickly, and then I'll come to immigration.	0
ClaimBuster	2421	Wanda Blackmore I met here from Missouri, the first time she bought drugs with her drug discount card, she paid $1.14, I think it was, for about $10 worth of drugs.	1
ClaimBuster	2422	That's why we have to invest in advanced manufacturing.	0
ClaimBuster	2423	"I think the thing that discouraged me about the vice president was uttering those famous words, ""No controlling legal authority."""	0
ClaimBuster	2424	I will not privatize it.	0
ClaimBuster	2425	I believe that when you get into a w- if you're going to get into war for the defense of Formosa, it ought to be on a clearly defined line.	0
ClaimBuster	2426	I proposed to the United States Congress a Clear Skies Initiative to reduce sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury by 70 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	2427	We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that's happening.	0
ClaimBuster	2428	The most heavily directed, decorated solder in uniform when he retired.	1
ClaimBuster	2429	Our inner cities are a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	2430	That's what a governor gets to do.	1
ClaimBuster	2431	She had a small business with 63 employees.	1
ClaimBuster	2432	When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt.	1
ClaimBuster	2433	We can't have any test of race.	0
ClaimBuster	2434	And all I say is, I don't know what the sixties will bring - except I think they will bring hard times in the uh - international sphere; I hope we can move ahead here at home in the United States; I'm confident we can do a far better job of mobilizing our economy and resources in the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	2435	They rewarded him by opening negotiations with Iran to transfer nuclear technology.	0
ClaimBuster	2436	The fact-finding committee's powers are limited.	0
ClaimBuster	2437	He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes.	1
ClaimBuster	2438	Mr. Ellis, I think this idea that has been spawned here in our country that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore it's uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is entirely spurious and it's dangerous to say this to the people.	0
ClaimBuster	2439	In the reinventing government program you just look at the numbers.	0
ClaimBuster	2440	We are going to cut taxes massively.	0
ClaimBuster	2441	Oh, you mean the rules.	0
ClaimBuster	2442	I want to bring that change to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	2443	We've got a plan to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	2444	Thank you very much, Ann.	0
ClaimBuster	2445	The Congress can modify the supply of money by modifying the income uh tax laws.	1
ClaimBuster	2446	The -- the greatest failure we've had with regards to -- to gun violence in some respects is what -- what is known as Fast and Furious.	1
ClaimBuster	2447	Was Ã¢â‚¬â€œ what was the question?	0
ClaimBuster	2448	This doesn't mean that the people aren't going to be paying the bill.	0
ClaimBuster	2449	And, there are eight other categories that should not have guns.	0
ClaimBuster	2450	I'm going to shut that loophole, and I'm going to give the tax benefit to the companies that stay here in America to help make them more competitive.	0
ClaimBuster	2451	What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	2452	And everything that I've tried to do, and everything that I'm now proposing for the next four years in terms of improving our education system or developing American energy or making sure that we're closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the United States, or closing our deficit in a responsible, balanced way that allows us to invest in our future.	0
ClaimBuster	2453	In other words, if we're going to continue to maintain our position in the sixties, we have to maintain a sound monetary and fiscal policy.	0
ClaimBuster	2454	I think we've given the American people back their spirit.	0
ClaimBuster	2455	When the president exercises his veto power, he has to have the people upo- behind him, not just a third of the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	2456	That's going to take money for infrastructure and investment to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	2457	I visited a Chrysler dealership in Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	2458	"Somebody here asked the question about, ""Why haven't you vetoed something?"""	1
ClaimBuster	2459	Half -- one out of two of the full-time college students in the United States are receiving some form of Federal aid.	1
ClaimBuster	2460	The president did not do what was necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	2461	And I would say, I don't know whether that's kind or not, it's just an objective statement.	0
ClaimBuster	2462	And Texas ranks 49th out of the 50 states in health care -- in children with health care.	1
ClaimBuster	2463	I don't think it's a question of whether people like you or not to make you an effective leader.	0
ClaimBuster	2464	I'm trying to decipher that.	0
ClaimBuster	2465	So if you're 60 or around 60 or older, you don't need to listen any further.	0
ClaimBuster	2466	I apologize to my family.	0
ClaimBuster	2467	Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.	1
ClaimBuster	2468	We're going to do that with regulatory reform.	0
ClaimBuster	2469	One was a bill for a dollar twenty-five cents an hour for anyone who works in a store or company that has a million dollars a year business.	1
ClaimBuster	2470	Thirdly, Arthur Gardner, a Republican Ambassador, Earl Smith, a Republican Ambassador, in succession - both have indicated in the past six weeks that they reported to Washington that Castro was a Marxist, that Raul Castro was a Communist, and that they got no effective results.	1
ClaimBuster	2471	He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt.	1
ClaimBuster	2472	With the American military forces nearby and in the field, we didn't use the best trained troops in the world to go kill the world's number one criminal and terrorist.	1
ClaimBuster	2473	The president mentioned that you need the right person in a crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	2474	So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies, and she caused the violence.	1
ClaimBuster	2475	This will give them availability.	0
ClaimBuster	2476	The governor, if it's a failing school, would leave the children in that failing school for three years and then give a little bit of money to the parents, a down payment on a down payment for private school tuition, and pretend that that would be enough for them to go out and go to a private school.	1
ClaimBuster	2477	I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.	0
ClaimBuster	2478	And he drew up this manual.	1
ClaimBuster	2479	He voted for the last two budgets that had that $24 billion more in spending than the budget that the Bush administration proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	2480	But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	2481	This is obviously a very tender topic.	0
ClaimBuster	2482	He's great as a -- as a -- as a speaker and describing his plans and his vision.	0
ClaimBuster	2483	We do and I hope...	0
ClaimBuster	2484	I would certainly also be judicious in evaluating any potential use of American troops overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	2485	That barely held even with -- if it did that much -- with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977.	1
ClaimBuster	2486	And, by the way, I like coal.	0
ClaimBuster	2487	We're doing better than a lot of the countries in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	2488	The reason I bring that up is because he's proposed $2.2 trillion in new spending, and he says he going to tax the rich to close the tax gap.	1
ClaimBuster	2489	Our country's in deep trouble.	0
ClaimBuster	2490	And I am -- I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA.	0
ClaimBuster	2491	We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	2492	Mr. Bush has said some very compelling things tonight that don't quite square with the record.	0
ClaimBuster	2493	I did support it at the time.	1
ClaimBuster	2494	That's why it's essential that we make sure that we keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of people like Al Qaida, which we are.	0
ClaimBuster	2495	So those are the kinds of things that we can now do because we're making that transition in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	2496	And we're going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here.	0
ClaimBuster	2497	But I'm not going to -- I'm not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for.	0
ClaimBuster	2498	(Laughter) Now, that's your tax money being wasted.	0
ClaimBuster	2499	And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.	1
ClaimBuster	2500	It ought to be not based on gender or ethnicity or color.	0
ClaimBuster	2501	So part of the reason I think it's so important for us to end the war in Iraq is to be able to get more troops into Afghanistan, put more pressure on the Afghan government to do what it needs to do, eliminate some of the drug trafficking that's funding terrorism.	1
ClaimBuster	2502	But there were a lot of families who didn't have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters or husbands didn't survive.	0
ClaimBuster	2503	Another thing is to deal with our - uh needs in the central cities, where the unemployment rate is extremely high: sometimes among minority groups, or those who don't speak English, or who're black, or young people, or - 40 percent of the employment.	1
ClaimBuster	2504	I'm sure your 6th grade kids are listening and saying, these guys will say anything to get elected.	0
ClaimBuster	2505	I've never seen members of a party locked out of meetings the way they're locked out today.	0
ClaimBuster	2506	I was in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat.	1
ClaimBuster	2507	That's why Senator Lugar says: incompetent in the delivery of services.	1
ClaimBuster	2508	Well, let's talk about what we need to compete.	0
ClaimBuster	2509	And don't take my word for it.	0
ClaimBuster	2510	Our tax rate for business in America is 35 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	2511	And it's one of the reasons why we have had the biggest drop in crime of any industrial state in America; why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in America.	1
ClaimBuster	2512	America remains the one indispensable nation.	0
ClaimBuster	2513	Government does not create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	2514	You've raised them by $1 trillion under Obamacare.	1
ClaimBuster	2515	And I think I have my strengths and I think the best thing going for Bob Dole is that Bob Dole keeps his word.	0
ClaimBuster	2516	I have described what has happened in Iran, and we weren't here then either.	0
ClaimBuster	2517	I will not agree to any arms control agreement, including a freeze, that's not verifiable.	0
ClaimBuster	2518	And what I've had to do is define, not just my position, but to define his and I hope I've done it fairly.	0
ClaimBuster	2519	But the fact that it is so strong enables us to project the power for good that America can represent.	0
ClaimBuster	2520	But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe.	0
ClaimBuster	2521	We had 7 billion this year and 10 billion more than the president.	1
ClaimBuster	2522	We have to make quality education there for all of our citizens, not just the privileged few.	0
ClaimBuster	2523	And give us a plan.	0
ClaimBuster	2524	We cannot frighten, as we have with the threats and the campaign rhetoric that has gone on in this campaign, our senior citizens - leave them thinking that in some way, they're endangered and they would have no place to turn.	0
ClaimBuster	2525	The harder you work, the more you can keep.	0
ClaimBuster	2526	And we've been through tough times but we always bounce back because of our character, because we pull together and if I have the privilege of being your president for another four years, I promise you I will always listen to your voices.	0
ClaimBuster	2527	I think it's the hard-working people of America's money and I want to share some of that money with you so you have more money to build and save and dream for your families.	0
ClaimBuster	2528	We knew he tortured his own people.	1
ClaimBuster	2529	It seems to totally belie the claim that I heard President Carter make a few days ago, that he was the first President that had come forth with a real urban strategy to meet the problems of urban America.	1
ClaimBuster	2530	But underlying that is loss of jobs and loss of income.	0
ClaimBuster	2531	And I believe I have sung at more weddings and more funerals than anybody ever to seek the Presidency.	1
ClaimBuster	2532	What I wish tonight so desperately is that we had had more time to talk about some of the other issues that are so fundamentally important.	0
ClaimBuster	2533	And people, Chris, will again go back to work and they'll make a lot of money.	0
ClaimBuster	2534	Obviously, this is another indication of trying to use the defense budget for political purposes, which he's trying to do tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	2535	And they want an American foreign policy that leads toward a safer world.	0
ClaimBuster	2536	But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot.	1
ClaimBuster	2537	The proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty.	1
ClaimBuster	2538	So health care needs to be affordable and available.	0
ClaimBuster	2539	Well, first of all, I appreciate enormously the personal comments the president just made.	0
ClaimBuster	2540	Let me make sure the seniors hear me loud and clear.	0
ClaimBuster	2541	Then, if the plans are huge and complex like health care, I would urge you to implement pilot programs.	0
ClaimBuster	2542	It's been a time, therefore, of illusion and false hopes, and the longer it continues, the more dangerous it becomes.	0
ClaimBuster	2543	And I've said mistakes were made.	0
ClaimBuster	2544	"""Oops, we haven't done the job."	0
ClaimBuster	2545	And we're organizing trade relations with countries other than China so that China starts feeling more pressure about meeting basic international standards.	1
ClaimBuster	2546	It wasn't failing to serve.	0
ClaimBuster	2547	It's with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	2548	I don't have an indoor gymnasium and an indoor tennis and an indoor every other thing they can think of; I don't have a place where I can go make free TV to send to my constituents to try to brainwash them to elect me the next time.	1
ClaimBuster	2549	I want the viewers out there to listen to what I have to say about it.	0
ClaimBuster	2550	That, I think, is a good balance.	0
ClaimBuster	2551	You don't turn national security into a political issue.	0
ClaimBuster	2552	I think that it basically has fallen.	0
ClaimBuster	2553	It had everything to do with energy.	0
ClaimBuster	2554	The President says it will disappear overnight because of some reason.	1
ClaimBuster	2555	We're not allowed to vote on it.	1
ClaimBuster	2556	The trillion comes from the surplus.	1
ClaimBuster	2557	I recommended to the Congress that we should increase production in this country from six hundred million tons a year to twel- a- a billion two hundred million tons by 1985.	1
ClaimBuster	2558	Is he talking about a former Governor of the State of California, who is a former prosecutor, a Republican named Earl Warren, because I think Chief Justice Earl Warren was an outstanding Chief Justice and I think most Americans do too.	1
ClaimBuster	2559	There we got more votes for condemning Hungary and looking into that situation than we got the last year.	1
ClaimBuster	2560	We've got a plan in place.	1
ClaimBuster	2561	That I can tell you.	0
ClaimBuster	2562	And President Bush has a very different path for a very different time.	0
ClaimBuster	2563	But it's gonna require people to bring both Republicans and Democrats together to get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	2564	How did we do that?	0
ClaimBuster	2565	I think what grows the economy is when we make sure small businesses are getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who fought for our country.	0
ClaimBuster	2566	We cannot have a lack of confidence in the blood supply when it comes to operations and surgery and things of this nature.	0
ClaimBuster	2567	Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system.	1
ClaimBuster	2568	Here's some thing that'll help.	0
ClaimBuster	2569	In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of -- I mean, these are unbelievable people that I've gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally.	1
ClaimBuster	2570	That's not the way to run our foreign policy, including international trade.	0
ClaimBuster	2571	"But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, ""I'll sit down,"" but you have to have a plan."	0
ClaimBuster	2572	And the way to do better is not to tax and spend but to retrain, get that control of the mandatory spending programs.	0
ClaimBuster	2573	And we've got to work with them if we are going to create an environment for human rights and democracy for the people of this hemisphere, and go to work on our single most important problem, and that is the avalanche of drugs that is poring into our country and virtually destroying those countries.	0
ClaimBuster	2574	I will not go back to the way the Democrats did it and used food as a political weapon and throw a grain embargo on the farmers in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	2575	I believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment.	0
ClaimBuster	2576	Her husband PJ got killed.	1
ClaimBuster	2577	And I say that those of us who stand against surrender of territory - this or any others - in the face of blackmail, in the s- face of force by the Communists are standing for the course that will lead to peace.	0
ClaimBuster	2578	And I believe that a fresh start, new credibility, a president who can understand what we have to do to reach out to the Muslim world to make it clear that this is not, you know -- Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq in order to go out to people and say that America has declared war on Islam.	0
ClaimBuster	2579	Values, judgment, and the record that I have amassed in my state also should count for something.	0
ClaimBuster	2580	I think it's very important that we reform our entitlement programs.	0
ClaimBuster	2581	But I do not want to go the tax-and-spend route.	0
ClaimBuster	2582	That will not help us compete with China.	0
ClaimBuster	2583	In 1977, we took that away from the military.	1
ClaimBuster	2584	I appreciate their idealism, their sacrifices.	0
ClaimBuster	2585	And I also think that we're going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities.	0
ClaimBuster	2586	Reform, prosperity, and peace, these are major challenges to the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	2587	Now, like uh - any hardworking uh - person seeking public office uh - in the campaign, inevitably sometimes you will use uh - rather graphic language and I'm guilty of that just like I think most others in the political arena.	0
ClaimBuster	2588	I think you'll find somebody who might interest you.	0
ClaimBuster	2589	And we need to reform.	0
ClaimBuster	2590	We spend more on our military than the next 10 countries combined; China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, you name it.	1
ClaimBuster	2591	And uh - the only purpose that I would see in registering uh - handguns and not long guns of any kind would be to prohibit the uh - ownership of those guns by those who've used them in the commission of a crime, or who uh - have been proven to be mentally incompetent to own a gun.	1
ClaimBuster	2592	I don't foresee those things happening, so I say with great confidence I'm not going to go for a tax.	0
ClaimBuster	2593	I'd like to leave you with the thought that the things I do as president are basically driven by the people whose lives I have seen affected by what does or doesn't happen in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	2594	Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states.	1
ClaimBuster	2595	Oscar, the question of what the federal government should do to limit the access of tobacco to young people is one of the biggest differences between Senator Dole and me.	1
ClaimBuster	2596	And that's the budget that we've put forward.	0
ClaimBuster	2597	I believe that that would help in terms of shelter.	0
ClaimBuster	2598	And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold.	0
ClaimBuster	2599	Most of this is due to regulations which either interfere with the mining of it or prevent the burning of it:.	1
ClaimBuster	2600	It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.	1
ClaimBuster	2601	And look at her website.	0
ClaimBuster	2602	All of them voted for freedom - a free type of government.	1
ClaimBuster	2603	But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that.	0
ClaimBuster	2604	And finally, I do believe in tax relief.	0
ClaimBuster	2605	He said if affirmative action means quotas, he's against it.	1
ClaimBuster	2606	When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community.	0
ClaimBuster	2607	I believe that we should defend Formosa.	0
ClaimBuster	2608	But the more immediate answer is to do what this lady was suggesting we do, and that is to get this deficit down and get on without adding to the woes, and then restructure.	0
ClaimBuster	2609	John, you want to give oil companies another $4 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	2610	And I believe that by eliminating ten million taxpayers in the last uh eight years, and by putting a heavier tax burden on those in the higher tax brackets, plus the other actions that've been taken uh - we can give taxpayers adequate tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	2611	There's only been one governor ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms, and that was me.	1
ClaimBuster	2612	The No Child Left Behind Act, incredibly enough, was good work between me and my administration and people like Senator Ted Kennedy.	0
ClaimBuster	2613	And I'm going to lead those troops to victory.	0
ClaimBuster	2614	We have literally Trump -- you can fact check him in real time.	0
ClaimBuster	2615	You don't have to go back to Herbert Hoover.	0
ClaimBuster	2616	Of course, the U.N. was invited in.	1
ClaimBuster	2617	And we have a very good fight.	0
ClaimBuster	2618	Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	2619	I would have put them in place earlier.	0
ClaimBuster	2620	I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	2621	So we're making progress but until we get that one done, we're not going to solve the neighborhood crime problem.	0
ClaimBuster	2622	I have said on a number of occasions exactly what I believe about the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	2623	First of all, I would be fearful that I might say something that was presently under way or in negotiations, and thus expose it and endanger the hostages, and sometimes, I think some of my ideas might require quiet diplomacy where you don't say in advance, or say to anyone, what it is you're thinking of doing.	0
ClaimBuster	2624	I'd just like to respond.	0
ClaimBuster	2625	We are now $120 billion of imports, 3 million jobs lost, and farmers are having their worst year.	1
ClaimBuster	2626	Well I don't think that in the winter of sixty-one under present economic conditions, it uh - a - uh - tax uh - increase would be desirable.	0
ClaimBuster	2627	And I just want to make one thing very clear.	0
ClaimBuster	2628	We have to make the Russians understand that there are penalties for these this kind of behavior, this kind of naked aggression into Georgia, a tiny country and a tiny democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	2629	"When he said, ""We're going to repeal Obamacare."	0
ClaimBuster	2630	Look, I want to make sure we use our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables.	0
ClaimBuster	2631	I got lots of relatives and they're good, average, middle-class, hardworking Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	2632	Well, first of all those are reports in the newspaper.	0
ClaimBuster	2633	The question is, was this wise?	0
ClaimBuster	2634	He rushed to war without a plan to win the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	2635	We have twenty different agencies in the federal government responsible for the production, the regulation, the uh - information about energy, the conservation of energy, spread all over government.	1
ClaimBuster	2636	President Eisenhower worked with a Democratic Congress very well.	1
ClaimBuster	2637	It means -- and I have to, again, repeat this.	0
ClaimBuster	2638	He discovered Boeing during the course of this campaign after I'd been talking about it for months.	1
ClaimBuster	2639	He has, in effect, said that he would agree with all of - he would disapprove of the vetoes that I have made, and would have added significantly to expenditures and the deficit in the federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	2640	Democrats or Republicans, it will be preserved.	0
ClaimBuster	2641	The key question that has to be answered in this election is will we use that prosperity wisely in a way that benefits all of our people and doesn't go just to the few.	0
ClaimBuster	2642	Number one, you make more making computer chips than potato chips; and, number 2, 19 out of 20 computer chips that we have in this country now come from Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	2643	It's an agenda that says we're listen to the young voices in Social Security and say we're going to think differently about making sure we have a system, but also fulfill the promise to the seniors in America.	0
ClaimBuster	2644	Why did she delete 33,000...	0
ClaimBuster	2645	We can't invest in science and technology, which will determine whether or not we are going to be competitive in the long term.	0
ClaimBuster	2646	I think that we've had something to do with that, just as we have with the drug problem nationwide.	0
ClaimBuster	2647	If you did that in the private sector, you'd be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	2648	I believe that we ought to have a balanced budget during normal economic circumstances.	0
ClaimBuster	2649	And I think that when the president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel, that they noticed that as well.	1
ClaimBuster	2650	And, as a result, America is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be.	0
ClaimBuster	2651	When you announce that you're going to launch an attack into another country, it's pretty obvious that you have the effect that it had in Pakistan: It turns public opinion against us.	0
ClaimBuster	2652	On economic policy, I associate with Warren Buffett and former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker.	0
ClaimBuster	2653	And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	2654	I've got a plan to control health care costs.	0
ClaimBuster	2655	First of all, we didn't find out he didn't have weapons until we got there, and my opponent thought he had weapons and told everybody he thought he had weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	2656	We need an answer to this problem, but it must be an American answer that is consistent with justice and due process.	0
ClaimBuster	2657	I would also like to point out that as far as Senator Kennedy's comments are concerned, I think he has a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this Administration whenever he thinks we're wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	2658	What he doesn't tell you is that he is going to tax your employer-based health care benefits for the first time ever.	1
ClaimBuster	2659	I think it's really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don't want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater.	0
ClaimBuster	2660	By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it.	0
