ClaimBuster	3324				Four years ago, in similar circumstances to this, I asked you, the American people, a question.	0
ClaimBuster	3325				If you make $200,000 a year or less, your taxes will go down.	1
ClaimBuster	3326				And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget.	1
ClaimBuster	3327				We'll negotiate with the drug companies for the cheapest available price on drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	3328				If you don't know what you're supposed to know, we'll make sure you do early before it's too late.	0
ClaimBuster	3329				Now, as long as we put up with that, that's what you're going to get.	0
ClaimBuster	3330				That's what I'm going to do as president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	3331				The meaning of this election is the future and whether we're going to grow and provide the jobs and the opportunities for all Americans and that they need.	0
ClaimBuster	3332				And the other thing is part of AIDS -- it's one of the few diseases where behavior matters.	0
ClaimBuster	3333				I'm for doing something both on the supply side and production side and on the consumption side.	0
ClaimBuster	3334				Don't forget that, that happened in 1993.	1
ClaimBuster	3335				I simply don't want to see the ratings on movies.	0
ClaimBuster	3336				And that's why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor Romney's pledge of not reducing the deficit or -- or -- or not adding to the deficit is by burdening middle-class families.	1
ClaimBuster	3337				It's ad hoc, it's sort of we get up in the morning and read the papers, what country's in trouble, we'll have a meeting.	0
ClaimBuster	3338				The President is still going to be president for the next four months and he, of course, is the only one who could commit this country in this period.	1
ClaimBuster	3339				And I think that racial profiling is part of a larger issue of how we deal with race in America.	0
ClaimBuster	3340				What bothers me is this growing tendency to try to use one's own personal interpretation of faith politically, to question others' faith, and to try to use the instrumentalities of government to impose those views on others.	0
ClaimBuster	3341				Senator Obama has opposed that.	1
ClaimBuster	3342				The government's bigger than it was when President Kennedy was around, even though he says it's not.	1
ClaimBuster	3343				One of the more important things we're doing in this administration is transformation.	0
ClaimBuster	3344				I remember working with Senator Ribicoff from Connecticut on the Hospice program.	1
ClaimBuster	3345				That is not the kind of leadership that you need, but you should expect that those are promises he's going to keep.	0
ClaimBuster	3346				Well, it's not only my opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	3347				Honor, duty, and country, that's what America is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	3348				"I've even scaled back some of my favorite programs already, like the child-care program I wanted to fund and the national service program, because the president's deficit keeps growing and I've said as a pledge, ""I'm going to cut the deficit in half in four years."""	0
ClaimBuster	3349				The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough.	0
ClaimBuster	3350				I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity.	1
ClaimBuster	3351				I, too, am pledged to a Social Security program that will reassure these senior citizens of ours that they are going to continue to get their money.	0
ClaimBuster	3352				So entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America together and having a discussion on this important topic, you pushed through something that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best answer and drove it through.	1
ClaimBuster	3353				We have to work with the police.	0
ClaimBuster	3354				It's been a big failure.	0
ClaimBuster	3355				It's no difference than this.	0
ClaimBuster	3356				We expected one at the time of the Vietnam War, but it was used up before we ever ended the war and taxpayers never got the adequate relief they deserved.	1
ClaimBuster	3357				Well, we've seen what has happened.	0
ClaimBuster	3358				And if you open the airways to more things like this, you see it's not just you that are participating here.	0
ClaimBuster	3359				If I could say one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	3360				And if you haven't noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow.	1
ClaimBuster	3361				And they look and they see.	0
ClaimBuster	3362				I can't tell you how much I love my wife and our daughters.	0
ClaimBuster	3363				It's not what the American people thought they were getting when they voted.	0
ClaimBuster	3364				I've generally supported it, but I've seen them make some calls that I thought were highly questionable.	0
ClaimBuster	3365				We'll find out on November 8th.	0
ClaimBuster	3366				That's a place where we can use our generosity to influence in a positive way, influence nations.	0
ClaimBuster	3367				I see an involvement by a thousand points of light.	0
ClaimBuster	3368				Not with quotas, but help meet a goal of ownership of small businesses, for example.	0
ClaimBuster	3369				Our children get off to a better start from pre-school programs and smaller classes in the early grades, and we have one of the most aggressive adult education programs in the country.	0
ClaimBuster	3370				But I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is.	0
ClaimBuster	3371				As a matter of fact, the statement that Senator Kennedy made was that - to the effect that there were trigger-happy Republicans, that my stand on Quemoy and Matsu was an indication of trigger-happy Republicans.	1
ClaimBuster	3372				The killer -- the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, Khalid Sheik Mohammed, is in prison.	1
ClaimBuster	3373				Right now we heard it.	0
ClaimBuster	3374				Now we've had this pause, but most economists, regardless of their political philosophy, uh - indicate that this pause for a month or two was healthy, because we could not have honestly sustained a 9.2 percent rate of growth which we had in the first quarter of this year.	1
ClaimBuster	3375				Now, you're paying for that.	0
ClaimBuster	3376				And he's also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasn't the case with me.	1
ClaimBuster	3377				I said I would make sure that women would be safe who used the drug.	1
ClaimBuster	3378				What you have to decide is who's got the best economic plan.	0
ClaimBuster	3379				Secondly, I would not suggest the withdrawal at the point of the Communist gun.	0
ClaimBuster	3380				You know, regulations cost the average family right here, Democrat or Republican, about $7,000 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	3381				And when a President doesn't know that submarine missiles are recallable, says that 70 percent of our strategic forces are conventional, discovers 3 years into his administration that our arms control efforts have failed because he didn't know that most Soviet missiles were on land -- these are things a President must know to command.	1
ClaimBuster	3382				But what you can do is create a fair playing field, and that's what I'm talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	3383				I believe it would return the government closer to the people, the way that Ross Perot is talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	3384				They want equal pay for comparable effort for women.	0
ClaimBuster	3385				I don't like to see the people in a deteriorating economy in a deteriorating country because our government has lost touch with the people.	0
ClaimBuster	3386				And I would do nothing to hurt the U.S. auto industry.	0
ClaimBuster	3387				"Which is -- which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and -- and lay down a piece of legislation and say, ""It's my way or the highway,"" I don't get a lot done."	0
ClaimBuster	3388				You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business.	1
ClaimBuster	3389				And that's why in this campaign I'm telling you exactly what I want to do.	0
ClaimBuster	3390				I believe that every agreement we reach must be verifiable, and I will not agree to anything that we cannot tell every day.	0
ClaimBuster	3391				I would have hoped that the president of the United States would have been possible for him to indicate it clearly that uh - the Supreme Court decision was going to be carried out.	0
ClaimBuster	3392				We have no country if we have no border.	0
ClaimBuster	3393				I think you have to look at it.	0
ClaimBuster	3394				On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half.	1
ClaimBuster	3395				The President in the election year decided I ought to do something, I haven't done anything on drugs.	1
ClaimBuster	3396				None of my proposals would have any effect on hunters, or sportsmen, or people who use rifles.	0
ClaimBuster	3397				And one journal, the San Francisco Chronicle, a respected newspaper, said there was no question about the fact that Governor Reagan had prevented the State of California from going bankrupt.	1
ClaimBuster	3398				Would fathers and mothers feel proud of themselves if they loaded their children with debts like this nation is now -- over a trillion dollars on the shoulders of our children?	1
ClaimBuster	3399				But we have a different set of convictions about how we make our country stronger here at home and respected again in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	3400				Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they're the job creators, they'd be burdened.	1
ClaimBuster	3401				The Iranians have met with Ambassador Crocker in Baghdad.	1
ClaimBuster	3402				They know what it's like not to have flexible working hours.	0
ClaimBuster	3403				When I was a boy it took 2 generations to double the standard of living.	1
ClaimBuster	3404				We've never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election.	1
ClaimBuster	3405				I think that's the very best way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	3406				But the hard reality is that we must know what we're doing and pursue those objectives that are possible in our time.	0
ClaimBuster	3407				That's one way one could do it.	0
ClaimBuster	3408				We encourage parents to take a look at the comparative results of schools.	0
ClaimBuster	3409				Our unemployment rate is twice as high as it is in Italy; it's three or four times as high as it is - as it is in Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	3410				In addition to that, we ought to have a - a shift toward the use of coal, particularly in the Appalachian regions where the coal is located.	1
ClaimBuster	3411				And recently the Chinese have announced they are going to lower some barriers to our products, which they ought to do since they have a 15 billion dollar trade surplus with the United States under Mr. Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	3412				Americans' workers are the best in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	3413				Did anybody complain when you raised taxes?	0
ClaimBuster	3414				I thought the administration was opposed to the Midgetman.	0
ClaimBuster	3415				I will only say this, however, in addition: to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested - to suggest that we will surrender these islands or force our Chinese Nationalist allies to surrender them in advance - is not something that would lead to peace; it is something that would lead, in my opinion, to war.	0
ClaimBuster	3416				There's no question about that.	0
ClaimBuster	3417				He needed to be disarmed.	0
ClaimBuster	3418				But they certainly are a little nervous when Senator Obama says, if you don't get the health care policy that I think you should have, then you're going to get fined.	0
ClaimBuster	3419				It's going to go in the other direction, as they've estimated.	0
ClaimBuster	3420				I believe that this struggle is going to go on, and it may be well decided in the next decade.	0
ClaimBuster	3421				Candy, it's not going to --	0
ClaimBuster	3422				But we've got to keep fighting on this war against drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	3423				I believe they did the best they could under the circumstances, and let's not forget that hundreds of thousands of lives were saved there.	1
ClaimBuster	3424				A President is called the Commander in Chief.	1
ClaimBuster	3425				I think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that I think good people on both sides can disagree on.	0
ClaimBuster	3426				It's a geopolitical foe, and I said in the same -- in the same paragraph I said, and Iran is the greatest national security threat we face.	1
ClaimBuster	3427				Now what all this, of course, adds up to is this: America has not been standing still.	0
ClaimBuster	3428				In fact, it's starting to fall apart not because of lawsuits -- though they are a problem, and John Edwards and I are committed to fixing them -- but because of the larger issue that we don't cover Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	3429				As I told you, we've just got a report that said over the past 13 months, we've created 1.9 million new jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	3430				We've got to go back and look.	0
ClaimBuster	3431				If she did nothing, we'd be in much better shape.	0
ClaimBuster	3432				I believe that we have uh - negotiated with the Soviet Union since I've been president from a position of strength.	1
ClaimBuster	3433				I do know that we have a choice to make in America and that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity.	0
ClaimBuster	3434				And I want to make sure they get armed and they have the arms necessary to defend themselves, but also to remove -- to remove Assad.	0
ClaimBuster	3435				Unfortunately, a lot of people, have never been as concerned about the Kurds as the United States has tried to be, and we've been flying an operation to protect them out of Turkey for many years now.	1
ClaimBuster	3436				They want jobs, they want to be able to make sure their kids are going to a good school.	0
ClaimBuster	3437				It's probably going to take a much, much higher figure.	0
ClaimBuster	3438				And I said I make a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	3439				And I think I'm on the right track.	0
ClaimBuster	3440				And despite that, what we've said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn't slip into a Great Depression, but what we've also said is, let's make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow.	1
ClaimBuster	3441				We talk about schools - three times as many classrooms built in the past Administration - and Eisenhower - than under the Truman Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	3442				And we put a stop to it and as a consequence saved jobs throughout America.	1
ClaimBuster	3443				The secretary said very strongly about working with -- we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen.	0
ClaimBuster	3444				She came all the way from Iowa in a Winnebago with her poodle in order attend here tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	3445				I am adamantly opposed to legalizing drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	3446				There is no question but that this nation cannot stand still; because we are in a deadly competition, a competition not only with the men in the Kremlin, but the men in Peking.	0
ClaimBuster	3447				I think that should be a goal.	0
ClaimBuster	3448				And it's going to require a new commander in chief to rebuild the military power.	0
ClaimBuster	3449				We tried six or eight years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	3450				I think they looked at that and saw weakness.	0
ClaimBuster	3451				I've also done everything I could at every moment of division in this country, after Oklahoma City, when these churches were burned, to bring people together and remind people that we are stronger because of our diversity.	0
ClaimBuster	3452				We also need to have a hemispheric energy policy where Canada, Mexico and the United States come together.	0
ClaimBuster	3453				And that's my view now.	0
ClaimBuster	3454				And it's -- our nation stands alone right now in the world in terms of power, and that's why we have to be humble.	0
ClaimBuster	3455				No, but, John, the fact of the matter is, is that I was opposed to those tax breaks, tried to strip them out.	1
ClaimBuster	3456				We learned from their mistakes.	0
ClaimBuster	3457				We can't defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million...	1
ClaimBuster	3458				How many of you are under managed care plans?	0
ClaimBuster	3459				I think the American people are sick and tired of either/or solutions, people being pushed in the corner, polarized to extremes.	0
ClaimBuster	3460				Well -- well, I need to speak a moment...	0
ClaimBuster	3461				You know, we have five percent of the world's population in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	3462				I think that's a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	3463				We cannot be satisfied with what we've been doing for the last eight years.	0
ClaimBuster	3464				We need to have a modern system to help seniors, and the idea of supporting a federally controlled 132,000-page document bureaucracy as being a compassionate way for seniors, and the only compassionate source of care for seniors is not my vision.	0
ClaimBuster	3465				I think the president owes it to family values to show that he values America's families, whether they're people on welfare you're trying to move from welfare to work, the working poor whom I think deserve a tax break to lift them above poverty if they've got a child in the house and working 40 hours a week, working families who deserve a fair tax system and the opportunity for constant retraining; they deserve a strong economy.	0
ClaimBuster	3466				I think it's important, since he talked about the Medicare plan, has he been in the United States Senate for 20 years?	1
ClaimBuster	3467				I'm the only person here who's ever balanced a government budget and I've presented 12 of them and cut spending repeatedly.	1
ClaimBuster	3468				If you're a single mother making $22,000 a year today and you're trying to raise two children, for every additional dollar you earn you pay a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone making $200,000, and that's not right.	1
ClaimBuster	3469				They were just waiting to seize the opportunity.	0
ClaimBuster	3470				And he just lifted martial law.	1
ClaimBuster	3471				And there are elements of my proposal that you just outlined which I won't repeat.	0
ClaimBuster	3472				A leader also understands that the United States must be strong to keep the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	3473				We have made the Social Security Trust Fund sound.	0
ClaimBuster	3474				They've got -- we've got to give them a chance to do their best again.	0
ClaimBuster	3475				So you may keep referring to it as a $5 trillion tax cut, but that's not my plan.	1
ClaimBuster	3476				The president said that the government can provide the service at lower cost and without a profit.	1
ClaimBuster	3477				No, I am not wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	3478				And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	3479				I -- I served as a missionary for my church.	1
ClaimBuster	3480				I mean, we've had years in which the reigning economic ideology has been what's good for Wall Street, but not what's good for Main Street.	0
ClaimBuster	3481				In addition, we've brought down inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	3482				It really depends upon how our nation conducts itself in foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	3483				But we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals.	0
ClaimBuster	3484				That's not what you did in that generation.	0
ClaimBuster	3485				I think we ought to have character education in our schools.	0
ClaimBuster	3486				I think that all new teachers ought to be tested in the subjects that they teach.	0
ClaimBuster	3487				But rather than help you, the taxpayer, have lower cost, rather than help seniors have less expensive drugs, the president made it illegal -- illegal -- for Medicare to actually go out and bargain for lower prices.	1
ClaimBuster	3488				Republicans talk about it, but we're the first the first administration in anybody's lifetime looking at this program to bring that deficit down four years in a row.	1
ClaimBuster	3489				We felt strongly about them, and they did so well by us.	0
ClaimBuster	3490				Finally had to come back to school, the chicken lost its feathers.	0
ClaimBuster	3491				And he cut defense an extra $60 billion, threw a lot of people out of work.	1
ClaimBuster	3492				I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole.	0
ClaimBuster	3493				The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against.	1
ClaimBuster	3494				The Nicaraguans must know that it is the policy of our government that that leadership must stay behind the boundaries of their nation, not interfere in other nations.	0
ClaimBuster	3495				But it√É¬è√¢‚Äö¬¨s not going to be dedicated by some federal bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.	0
ClaimBuster	3496				And it seems to me that there is a problem there, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	3497				We didn't have the cuts the president promised he'd make and then he doubled.	1
ClaimBuster	3498				We do have an obligation, but we can't be all things to all people.	0
ClaimBuster	3499				And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on.	0
ClaimBuster	3500				George Bush believes in them.	0
ClaimBuster	3501				I remember distinctly, I was segueing into another subject.	0
ClaimBuster	3502				And I'm saying, where is this?	0
ClaimBuster	3503				"I believe that -- I believe they've moved that sign, ""The buck stops here"" from the Oval Office desk to ""The buck stops here"" on the Lincoln bedroom."	0
ClaimBuster	3504				And that's what we have to -- I think that's the test of public service.	0
ClaimBuster	3505				Every President until this one has been able to do it, and this nation -- or the world is more dangerous as a result.	0
ClaimBuster	3506				Americans are angry, they're upset, and they're a little fearful.	0
ClaimBuster	3507				Instead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together.	1
ClaimBuster	3508				You don't muddle through the central front on terror and you don't muddle through going after bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	3509				But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country.	0
ClaimBuster	3510				I see a young man who is a knowledgeable-in defense and there are three people on our ticket that are knowledgeable-in the whole-in the race-knowledgeable in defense and Dan Quayle is one of them and I am one of them.	0
ClaimBuster	3511				And one of the things that I intend to do as president is to restore America's standing in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	3512				Our health-care system is the envy of the world because we believe in making sure that the decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by officials in the nation's capital.	0
ClaimBuster	3513				That is not a recipe for making sure that we are taking advantage of the opportunities and meeting the challenges of the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	3514				Now, you know, that may not seem like a big deal when it just is, you know, numbers on a sheet of paper, but if we're talking about a family who's got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid, that's a big problem.	0
ClaimBuster	3515				I mean that's what, I want to stop it from coming across the border.	0
ClaimBuster	3516				I'll never give a veto over American security to any other entity -- not a nation, not a country, not an institution.	0
ClaimBuster	3517				And I have made some good sound proposals.	0
ClaimBuster	3518				What I think we ought to do is take a look at perestroika and glasnost, welcome them, but keep our eyes open.	0
ClaimBuster	3519				But I think it's about his priorities.	0
ClaimBuster	3520				Now we have to create those jobs, now that we're requiring people to go do work.	0
ClaimBuster	3521				Well, Jim, I want to thank you and thank the folks here at Washington University and the vice president.	0
ClaimBuster	3522				I went to a boys' club.	1
ClaimBuster	3523				But at some point, we want to do that as well.	0
ClaimBuster	3524				I don't want to go back to malaise and misery index.	0
ClaimBuster	3525				I think you have to knock out ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	3526				I grew up 5 blocks from Arkansas.	1
ClaimBuster	3527				And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left.	1
ClaimBuster	3528				Yes, let me respond to this.	0
ClaimBuster	3529				Do you know today that the Com- the Russians broadcast ten times as many programs in Spanish to Latin America as we do?	1
ClaimBuster	3530				me that the Federal grants that come with.	0
ClaimBuster	3531				We've got to grow enough to maintain the forces that we have abroad and to wage the non-military battle for the war - uh - for the world in Asia, in Africa and Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	3532				He's added more debt to the debt of the United States in four years than all the way from George Washington to Ronald Reagan put together.	1
ClaimBuster	3533				It's inconvenient for Senator Dole, but the truth is I've reduced the size of government more than my Republican predecessors.	1
ClaimBuster	3534				We've put a cap on the growth of all that spending, and that's good and that's helped.	1
ClaimBuster	3535				Well, the Vice President and I came to the Congress together 1946; we both served in the Labor Committee.	1
ClaimBuster	3536				We need to invest and save.	0
ClaimBuster	3537				The take-home pay of a worker in this country is actually less now than it was in 1968 - measured in real dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	3538				But just one point I want to make, Tom.	0
ClaimBuster	3539				I don't think that even if that effort fails that it will be necessary to carry on tests in the atmosphere which pollute the atmosphere.	0
ClaimBuster	3540				We've got to attack at all points, we've go to use undercover operations.	0
ClaimBuster	3541				But let me also point out that to several parliaments around the world, in Europe and in Asia, I have made a statement to each one of them, and I'll repeat it here: A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.	1
ClaimBuster	3542				We have a problem with litigation in the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	3543				I'd like to respond to that.	0
ClaimBuster	3544				He offers retreads of programs that failed.	1
ClaimBuster	3545				I'd say around 30 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	3546				I think this is a great country, because we've always wanted to do better, to make our country better, to make our lives better.	0
ClaimBuster	3547				Do you believe in MAD, mutual assured destruction, mutual deterrence as it has been practiced for the last generation?	0
ClaimBuster	3548				That's the way you help people.	0
ClaimBuster	3549				A good place to start is to say no managed care provider can gag a doctor and kick the doctor out of the managed care plan for the doctor, telling the patient, you need a more expensive test, you need a more expensive procedure, your health requires it.	0
ClaimBuster	3550				I haven't started naming names except for one person, and that's Mr. Richard Cheney who I thought did a great job the other night.	0
ClaimBuster	3551				And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks.	1
ClaimBuster	3552				... so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	3553				Number two, I'll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state.	0
ClaimBuster	3554				And that's why I'm trying to do something about it by stimulating the export, vesting more, better education systems.	0
ClaimBuster	3555				Congress is hiring people by the droves, and the cast as a result has gone up.	0
ClaimBuster	3556				Not working with government alone, but all of us working together.	0
ClaimBuster	3557				Number four, if you're under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn't happen before.	1
ClaimBuster	3558				So choice and competition amongst schools is one of the key elements that's already been proven in places in like New Orleans and New York City and other places, where we have charter schools, where we take good teachers and we reward them and promote them.	1
ClaimBuster	3559				That was my posture as well.	0
ClaimBuster	3560				Those are the kinds of choices that the American people face right now.	1
ClaimBuster	3561				It's time for the man to leave.	0
ClaimBuster	3562				Cutting our investments in research and technology, that's not a smart choice.	0
ClaimBuster	3563				And it was always one of the things we argued about with respect to arms control.	0
ClaimBuster	3564				We've read their accounts now about what happened.	1
ClaimBuster	3565				People can look it up, you're right.	0
ClaimBuster	3566				If you've got an employer-based health care plan, you keep it.	0
ClaimBuster	3567				Secretary of Defense Robert Gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in Afghanistan and it needs to end there.	1
ClaimBuster	3568				He actually got the first question.	1
ClaimBuster	3569				If you feel that everything that is being done now is satisfactory, that the relative power and prestige and strength of the United States is increasing in relation to that of the Communists; that we've b- gaining more security, that we are achieving everything as a nation that we should achieve, that we are achieving a better life for our citizens and greater strength, then I agree.	0
ClaimBuster	3570				Now that's not reform, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	3571				In this Administration we've stopped them at Quemoy and Matsu; we've stopped them in Indochina; we've stopped them in Lebanon; we've stopped them in other parts of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	3572				And that's what I intend to do when I'm president.	0
ClaimBuster	3573				And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade.	0
ClaimBuster	3574				No, I don't think it's OK, and said so publicly.	0
ClaimBuster	3575				My state now ranks first in the country in job growth this year, fourth in income growth, fourth in reduction of poverty, third in overall economic performance, according to a major news magazine.	1
ClaimBuster	3576				He is right that I'm not in favor of energy taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	3577				You see, I do believe that some crimes are so heinous, so brutal, so outrageous, and I'd say particularly those that result in the death of a police officer, for those real brutal crimes, I do believe in the death penalty, and I think it is a deterrent, and I believe we need it.	0
ClaimBuster	3578				Uh - we've always had, I think, a lot of constitutional amendments proposed, but the passage of them has been uh - fairly slow, and uh - few and far between.	0
ClaimBuster	3579				It ought to be tried.	0
ClaimBuster	3580				We have to be prepared to use military force against terrorist base camps, we have to work closely with our allies to make sure that they're working with us and we with them and we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back of international terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	3581				They have to pay up.	0
ClaimBuster	3582				I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other.	0
ClaimBuster	3583				The issue is what you do about it.	0
ClaimBuster	3584				We ought to keep making those extra effort Affirmative Action programs, the law and the policy of the land.	0
ClaimBuster	3585				If that were true, why didn't we identify ourselves with the people of Africa?	0
ClaimBuster	3586				The degree of unpopularity of a regime when the choice is total authoritarianism totalitarianism, I should say, in the alternative government, makes one wonder whether you are being helpful to the people.	0
ClaimBuster	3587				And we knew the limits on their nuclear power.	0
ClaimBuster	3588				I've lived the American dream; I'd like for your children to be able to live it, too.	0
ClaimBuster	3589				That's exactly what we're doing.	0
ClaimBuster	3590				And that's why I have made it a number one priority in my budget, not a tax cut for the wealthy.	1
ClaimBuster	3591				I know all about poverty and all about need and all about taking care of people, and that's been my career in the United States Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	3592				As for offshore oiling, only 2% now is so leased and is producing oil.	1
ClaimBuster	3593				Why would you want to do that, anyone, anyone in America, when we have such a tough time, when these small business people, like Joe the plumber, are going to create jobs, unless you take that money from him and spread the wealth around.	0
ClaimBuster	3594				I can bring them in that direction by eliminating spending.	0
ClaimBuster	3595				And I've covered it again and again in print and on television.	1
ClaimBuster	3596				One, he clearly has a litmus test for his judges, which I disagree with.	1
ClaimBuster	3597				It will require the ability of a Republican president to reach out across the partisan divide and to say to Democrats, let's come together to do what is right for America.	0
ClaimBuster	3598				Tell you what I hear.	0
ClaimBuster	3599				Now, if that quote was wrong, he can repudiate it, right here.	0
ClaimBuster	3600				On the tax cut, it's a big decision.	0
ClaimBuster	3601				I remember the floods that swept our state.	0
ClaimBuster	3602				But I'll tell you this, as president, if it took American forces to some degree to coalesce the African Union, I'd be prepared to do it because we could never allow another Rwanda.	0
ClaimBuster	3603				I think we ought to focus on the problems and not attack each other.	0
ClaimBuster	3604				George McGovern is a friend of mine, so I don't mean, but he was a liberal, proud liberal.	1
ClaimBuster	3605				The American people should make up their own mind.	0
ClaimBuster	3606				I did not say that.	1
ClaimBuster	3607				And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked.	1
ClaimBuster	3608				There are 200,000 people in California, for example, who have lost their defense related jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	3609				Well, we may not be there yet but we're not going to get there by giving preferences and quotas.	0
ClaimBuster	3610				Who has the integrity and stability to get the job done?√É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬∞√Ç¬§ My fellow Americans, I am that man and I ask for your support.	0
ClaimBuster	3611				It will remain strong, so long as I'm the president.	0
ClaimBuster	3612				A few months later, he said he wanted to cut the defense budget by eight or nine billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	3613				And so I have just negotiated with the president of Mexico the North American Free Trade Agreement -- and the prime minister of Canada, I might add -- and I want to have more of these free trade agreements, because export jobs are increasing far faster than any jobs that may have moved overseas.	1
ClaimBuster	3614				We've upheld the doctrine that said if you harbor a terrorist, you're equally as guilty as the terrorist.	1
ClaimBuster	3615				Well, we're $4 trillion in debt.	1
ClaimBuster	3616				And 3 days after the election in 1982, they came to us and said, Social Security, we know, is broke.	1
ClaimBuster	3617				We passed the bill in the Senate this year but it didn't pass the House.	1
ClaimBuster	3618				I will work with Republicans and Democrats.	0
ClaimBuster	3619				Bio-degradable plastics-plastic-gasohol, which the Vice President has been involved in, road de-icers made from corn products.	1
ClaimBuster	3620				Now, when you look at what Germany pays for money and what we don't pay for money, you realize there's quite a spread, right, and you realize this is a temporary thing and there's going to be another sucking sound that runs our deficit through the roof.	0
ClaimBuster	3621				I have never said I would liquidate...	1
ClaimBuster	3622				"The real mistake was the ""read my lips"" promise in the first place."	0
ClaimBuster	3623				I think that it's important for judges to understand that if a woman is out there trying to raise a family, trying to support her family, and is being treated unfairly, then the court has to stand up, if nobody else will.	0
ClaimBuster	3624				The real problem in this country is that most people are working hard and falling farther behind.	0
ClaimBuster	3625				And I'm going to put in place a better homeland security effort.	0
ClaimBuster	3626				You know, the president's father did not go into Iraq, into Baghdad, beyond Basra.	1
ClaimBuster	3627				And it wasn't me that let the polluters actually come into the halls of Congress, into the rooms, and rewrite the environmental laws.	1
ClaimBuster	3628				But I'll never fail to protect the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	3629				There's now a general strike going on.	1
ClaimBuster	3630				In my judgment, a vigorous Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in the House and Senate can win the support for these programs.	0
ClaimBuster	3631				Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it.	1
ClaimBuster	3632				And I'm very, very proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	3633				The same is true of highways.	1
ClaimBuster	3634				I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	3635				Giving aid to schools technically that are trying to carry out the decision is not the great question.	0
ClaimBuster	3636				Secondly, if it is correct, have you informed yourself in the meantime?	0
ClaimBuster	3637				We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.	0
ClaimBuster	3638				But -- but what it did do is to -- if you extrapolated how much money we're talking about, you'd look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	3639				I happen to like President Clinton personally.	0
ClaimBuster	3640				We had some fun Crystal Gayle and Loretta Lynn with us, and they got up and sang, went to little towns and I talked agriculture.	1
ClaimBuster	3641				I don't blame them entirely for it.	0
ClaimBuster	3642				And we have a winning fight.	0
ClaimBuster	3643				And if such a defense could be found, wouldn't it be far more humanitarian to say that now we can defend against a nuclear war by destroying missiles instead of slaughtering millions of people?	0
ClaimBuster	3644				Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.	1
ClaimBuster	3645				First we have to understand that SALT I expires October third 1977.	1
ClaimBuster	3646				They're reliable friends in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	3647				And it's time we take a look at the pay scales.	0
ClaimBuster	3648				First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing.	0
ClaimBuster	3649				I had the chance to be governor of a state.	1
ClaimBuster	3650				I've got a policy for the future and agenda for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	3651				I voted for Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg.	1
ClaimBuster	3652				When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper-income individuals can -- are currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you don't come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending.	1
ClaimBuster	3653				Tell him you can have everything you got.	0
ClaimBuster	3654				My opponent, the senator, talks about foreign policy.	1
ClaimBuster	3655				What we've said is to states, we'll give you more money if you initiate reforms.	1
ClaimBuster	3656				I will try to do the same thing.	0
ClaimBuster	3657				The United States must maintain a defense capability of the Panama Canal.	0
ClaimBuster	3658				And that's going to require effort from each and every one of us.	0
ClaimBuster	3659				Laura and I are proud parents of teenage girls, twin daughters, and I know what you're saying.	1
ClaimBuster	3660				Admiral Mullen suggests that Senator Obama's plan is dangerous for America.	1
ClaimBuster	3661				That was a great -- I thought a great display of presidential leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	3662				But I do know that, despite his pledge to reduce state Government spending, that it rose from $4.6 billion when he took office in 1967, to $10.2 billion during his eight years in office.	1
ClaimBuster	3663				But being as they have not yet been willing to recognize Kostunica as the lawful winner of the election, I'm not sure it's right for us to invite the president of Russia to mediate this -- this dispute there because we might not like the results that comes out of that.	1
ClaimBuster	3664				That starts putting the squeeze on them.	0
ClaimBuster	3665				And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.	0
ClaimBuster	3666				And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected?	1
ClaimBuster	3667				And so the question now is how do we build on those strengths.	0
ClaimBuster	3668				I mean, he can throw out all kinds -- I don't know the particulars of this law.	0
ClaimBuster	3669				... get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I'm sorry, you've got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma...	0
ClaimBuster	3670				Now, under Senator McCain's plan there is a strong risk that people would lose their employer-based health care.	1
ClaimBuster	3671				And I do think that there's constructive work being done out there.	0
ClaimBuster	3672				"I was a little disappointed in Magic because he came to me and I said, ""Now if you see something we're not doing, get ahold of me."	0
ClaimBuster	3673				We uh - have got to do that at the federal government level.	0
ClaimBuster	3674				I have so many things there to respond to, I'm going to pick out something you said earlier.	0
ClaimBuster	3675				We're going to have a hard time rebuilding it.	0
ClaimBuster	3676				It also requires something that Governor Bush's plan doesn't.	0
ClaimBuster	3677				You're seeing it right now in the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	3678				Our people are out of work, and there's a sense of withdrawal.	0
ClaimBuster	3679				And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice.	0
ClaimBuster	3680				Number two, we're going to have to stop illegal immigration.	0
ClaimBuster	3681				They're not as stupid as Washington thinks they are.	0
ClaimBuster	3682				And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.	0
ClaimBuster	3683				I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.	0
ClaimBuster	3684				And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.	0
ClaimBuster	3685				I've got a lot of experience in not taking 10 years to solve a 10-minute problem.	0
ClaimBuster	3686				He didn't do all these things.	1
ClaimBuster	3687				"It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid so people at the lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then it also - I do not want to see us mandate across the board that every company has to do this, because I really think that marginal operators are going to go say, ""We can't make it."""	0
ClaimBuster	3688				I believe that our future as a nation depends upon whether or not we can break down these barriers that have been used to pit group against group, and bring our people together.	0
ClaimBuster	3689				I know what strong political leadership is.	0
ClaimBuster	3690				And, by the way, our beloved Nancy Reagan is in the hospital tonight, so our thoughts and prayers are going with you.	1
ClaimBuster	3691				They were counterfeit products being made overseas with the same serial number as a U.S. company, the same packaging, these were being sold into our market and around the world as if they were made by the U.S. competitor.	1
ClaimBuster	3692				Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours?	0
ClaimBuster	3693				But I believe the effort should be made once more by who's ever elected president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	3694				I'm going to be running an ad pretty soon that shows they promised us they were going to hold the line on spending at the tax and budget summit, and I'm going to show how much they've increased this little stuff they do for themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	3695				He has asked for $932 million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that he's been in the United States Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	3696				Come on, give me five.	0
ClaimBuster	3697				and that's simply why I proposed, 15 months ago, the emergency excise tax on gasoline that I did.	1
ClaimBuster	3698				So I'm not going to begin, and I'm not going to go to entitlements as a means for cutting that deficit when we're spending billions on something like Star Wars, when we're spending billions on other weapon systems which apparently the Vice President wants to keep in his back pocket or some place, but which, if we continue to spend billions on them, will force us to cut Social Security, to cut Medicare, to cut these basic entitlements to people of very, very modest means.	0
ClaimBuster	3699				In Puerto Rico this year, I met with six of the leading industrial nations' heads of state to meet the problem of inflation so we would be able to solve it before it got out of hand.	1
ClaimBuster	3700				and must do what he's talking about now.	0
ClaimBuster	3701				Five hundred thousand kids lost after-school programs because of your budget.	1
ClaimBuster	3702				And I believe it incumbent upon us now to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	3703				I believe that this president, regrettably, rushed us into a war, made decisions about foreign policy, pushed alliances away.	0
ClaimBuster	3704				That's the strategy you need, an all-of-the-above strategy, and that's what we're going to do in the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	3705				"And on the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting the ""Celebrity Apprentice."""	1
ClaimBuster	3706				It is also used to give your mothers and fathers the Social Security checks that they live on.	1
ClaimBuster	3707				There's a difference in my opinion - uh and in accordance with the ruling of the Supreme Court and accordance with the definition in the dictionary.	0
ClaimBuster	3708				It's a different world now.	0
ClaimBuster	3709				We didn't guard 850,000 tons of ammo.	1
ClaimBuster	3710				That's what I hope to get to talk about tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	3711				The U-2 flights were proper from the point of view of protecting our security.	0
ClaimBuster	3712				We're the great nation that has allies, 42 allies and friends around the world.	1
ClaimBuster	3713				Is it President Obama's fault?	0
ClaimBuster	3714				And there are more, if you want to talk about percentage appointments, more Members of Congress who have been under investigation percentage-wise that people in the executive branch.	1
ClaimBuster	3715				We told him that we wouldn't get involved with his border dispute, and we've never revealed those papers that were given to Ambassador Glaspie on July the 25th.	1
ClaimBuster	3716				Our tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery.	0
ClaimBuster	3717				I understand that Governor Carter, when he was Governor of Georgia, vetoed between thirty-five and forty bills a year.	1
ClaimBuster	3718				We're going to go through a period of shared sacrifice.	0
ClaimBuster	3719				But they were all totally -- it was all fiction.	1
ClaimBuster	3720				But I know this, that President Kennedy in his inaugural address told all of us that here on Earth, God's work must truly be our own.	1
ClaimBuster	3721				In addition to that, I believe we have a crisis here at home, a crisis of the middle class that is increasingly squeezed, health-care costs going up.	1
ClaimBuster	3722				What I've had as a basic commitment since I've been President is to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.	1
ClaimBuster	3723				And you cannot fight a victory for Communism or a strategy of victory for Communism with the strategy, simply of holding the line.	0
ClaimBuster	3724				And we'll continue to spread freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	3725				So, it is good fo the American people to remember that there is a sharp basic historical difference between Governor Reagan and me on these crucial issues - also, between the two parties that we represent.	0
ClaimBuster	3726				Employers of under 50 are exempted.	1
ClaimBuster	3727				The earthquake and the hurricanes, it has devastated Haiti.	1
ClaimBuster	3728				What I'd also like to point out the Iranians are putting the most lethal IEDs into Iraq which are killing young Americans, there are special groups in Iran coming into Iraq and are being trained in Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	3729				That's why the Patriot Act was important.	0
ClaimBuster	3730				Sometimes my advice has been taken.	0
ClaimBuster	3731				The point is that throughout history, whether it be Ronald Reagan, who wouldn't sit down with Brezhnev, Andropov or Chernenko until Gorbachev was ready with glasnost and perestroika.	1
ClaimBuster	3732				The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	3733				I think a lot of it uh - depends on current events - uh - sometimes foreign affairs, sometimes domestic affairs.	0
ClaimBuster	3734				Maybe he'll tell us where he stand on it tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	3735				By the way, the average policy costs about $12,000.	1
ClaimBuster	3736				I just want to make -- foreign lobbyists, this whole thing.	0
ClaimBuster	3737				I think what we have to do, however, is have the president and the leadership set before our country exactly what we must do in the next decade, if we're going to maintain our security in education, in economic growth, in development of natural resources.	0
ClaimBuster	3738				I think, joining with our allies and friends in a league of democracies, that we can effectively abridge their behavior, and hopefully they would abandon this quest that they are on for nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	3739				In the cabinet I have one of the outstanding, I think, administrators as the secretary of transportation, Bill Coleman.	0
ClaimBuster	3740				I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation.	0
ClaimBuster	3741				You know, the American people are fair.	0
ClaimBuster	3742				Che Guevara was a contemptible figure in civilization's history.	0
ClaimBuster	3743				You've got to read what he said.	0
ClaimBuster	3744				perhaps, some special interest groups who are tied closely to government.	0
ClaimBuster	3745				I said in my acceptance speech in San Diego about two months ago that the exits are clearly marked.	1
ClaimBuster	3746				You see, there has to be a consequence.	0
ClaimBuster	3747				And I didn't even apologize to my wife, who's sitting right here, because I didn't do anything.	1
ClaimBuster	3748				The reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the President was against them; it was because the people were against them.	0
ClaimBuster	3749				Another thing that concerned me was what Mr. Ford said about unemployment, that - insinuating that under Johnson and Kennedy that unemployment could only be held down when this country is at war.	1
ClaimBuster	3750				I have never promised more than I could produce and I have produced everything that I promised.	0
ClaimBuster	3751				That was one of the worst things that's ever been signed by our country.	0
ClaimBuster	3752				He also said in December of 2003 that anyone who doubts that the world is safer without Saddam Hussein does not have the judgment to be president.	1
ClaimBuster	3753				This has been their primary focus.	1
ClaimBuster	3754				Now, if you're willing to join us in getting rid of all the nuclear weapons in the world, then we'll give you this one, so that we would both know that no one can cheat; that we're both got something that if anyone tries to cheat .	0
ClaimBuster	3755				I became president at the time that the United States was in a very troubled time.	0
ClaimBuster	3756				The treaty does not include these two islands.	1
ClaimBuster	3757				This has expressed itself in the revolts in Eastern Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	3758				That uh - situation called for me to first put the United States on a steady course and to keep our keel well balanced, because we had to face the difficult problems that had all of a sudden hit America.	0
ClaimBuster	3759				And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops.	1
ClaimBuster	3760				For those of you for my opponent, please only vote once.	0
ClaimBuster	3761				I heard Gov Clinton congratulate us on 1 thing -- first time he said something pleasant about this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	3762				I think the most important thing to emphasize, though, is that we also have to help people in other ways to build a strong economy and we can't have any tax cut that's not paid for.	0
ClaimBuster	3763				The fact that the faith speaks to us and that we are moral people, hopefully, I accept and rejoice in.	0
ClaimBuster	3764				And if we can't love one another, we ought to get along with one another.	0
ClaimBuster	3765				Values begin at the top, in the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	3766				Let's look at the other side of the coin.	0
ClaimBuster	3767				I just love the fact that everybody, particularly in the media, goes bonkers over the town hall.	0
ClaimBuster	3768				Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission.	1
ClaimBuster	3769				We need to deny them the recruits.	0
ClaimBuster	3770				I am suggesting that there are literally thousands of unnecessary regulations that invade every facet of business, and indeed, very much of our personal lives, that are unnecessary; that Government can do without; that have added $130 billion to the cost of production in this country; and that are contributing their part to inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	3771				If we are strong, particularly as we face a crisis over Berlin - which we may in the spring, or in the winter - it's important that we maintain our determination here; that we indicate that we're building our strength; that we are determined to protect our position; that we're determined to protect our commitment.	0
ClaimBuster	3772				This is a peaceful nation, and I intend to keep the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	3773				One thing to blame is these malpractice lawsuits.	0
ClaimBuster	3774				All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run.	0
ClaimBuster	3775				When Governor Romney says that we should eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, there are millions of women all across the country, who rely on Planned Parenthood for, not just contraceptive care, they rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings.	1
ClaimBuster	3776				You want to have a new program in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	3777				People who pay taxes will get tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	3778				We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them.	0
ClaimBuster	3779				So that I believe that on this subject we can balance the budget unless we have a national emergency or unless we have a severe recession.	0
ClaimBuster	3780				Every other ad -- ever other ad was an attack ad on my health care plan.	1
ClaimBuster	3781				This issue has been too long on the table because it's been a political issue.	1
ClaimBuster	3782				So first it will be Quemoy and Matsu, next it may be Formosa.	0
ClaimBuster	3783				Mr. Carter has indicated he would look with sympathy to a Communist government in NATO.	1
ClaimBuster	3784				I just believe it's time to change.	0
ClaimBuster	3785				Because if you bring rates down, it makes it easier for small business to keep more of their capital and hire people.	1
ClaimBuster	3786				I don't stand on it because it isn't something to stand on but something to build on.	0
ClaimBuster	3787				It should have never happened.	0
ClaimBuster	3788				In terms of vetoing tax bills, you're darn right.	0
ClaimBuster	3789				Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement.	0
ClaimBuster	3790				But they're not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like Medicaid.	0
ClaimBuster	3791				I want to think that they're going to be able to afford an education.	0
ClaimBuster	3792				And over a longer period of time, let the federal government begin to absorb part of it that's now paid by the state governments.	0
ClaimBuster	3793				We're going to see that it doesn't.	0
ClaimBuster	3794				And so it's important to understand that the -- I think the American people are hungry for the kind of leadership that is going to tackle these problems not just in government, but outside of government.	0
ClaimBuster	3795				I believe that this party - Republican party - has stood still really for twenty-five years - its leadership has.	0
ClaimBuster	3796				Now there are some places where I think -- you know, I've supported the administration in Columbia.	0
ClaimBuster	3797				We did not go as a last resort.	0
ClaimBuster	3798				Nobody knows who hired this man.	1
ClaimBuster	3799				Well, I don't have any idea but I hope it will happen some time in my lifetime.	0
ClaimBuster	3800				I resent it because th- it's an implication that Republicans have been trigger-happy and, therefore, would lead this nation into war.	0
ClaimBuster	3801				I'm Chairman of the President's Task Force on Regulatory Relief and we are working with the FDA and they have sped up bringing drugs to market that can help.	1
ClaimBuster	3802				I want to say something, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	3803				Show me one accomplishment toward Medicare that he accomplished.	0
ClaimBuster	3804				He can provide an injunction if there's a national emergency for eighty days, then the strike can go on; and there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he went to the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	3805				Medical liability issues are a problem, a significant problem.	1
ClaimBuster	3806				Doctors are giving prescriptions, they're recommending treatments, and then their recommendations are being overruled by HMOs and insurance companies.	1
ClaimBuster	3807				Secondly, of course we've been involved with Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	3808				We cannot, of course, control the Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	3809				But there's no doubt there's a lot of opposition to it in the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	3810				And I think maybe we could look back over our shoulders and wonder whether it was right to let all those mental patients out.	0
ClaimBuster	3811				I don't like that idea.	0
ClaimBuster	3812				In countries like Libya or Iraq, we have even alienated some of our closest trade partners because we have insisted upon the control of the spread of nuclear weapons to those potentially terrorist countries.	1
ClaimBuster	3813				Those who can afford to have them will continue to have them.	0
ClaimBuster	3814				But the first -- pardon me -- the first time we went in, we went in at their request because the war was going on right in Beirut between Israel and the PLO terrorists.	1
ClaimBuster	3815				And she can say all she wants about college tuition.	0
ClaimBuster	3816				On jobs -- that's the number one priority, and I believe my program for stimulating investment, encouraging small business, brand-new approach to education, strengthening the American family, and, yes, creating more exports is the way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	3817				We added 1.9 million new jobs over the last 13 months.	1
ClaimBuster	3818				Do you realize, 900,000 small businesses will be taxed under his plan because most small businesses are Subchapter S corps or limited partnerships, and they pay tax at the individual income tax level.	1
ClaimBuster	3819				Now I believe there's a better way to do this.	0
ClaimBuster	3820				Our government shouldn't have allowed that to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	3821				And whenever the uh - automobile manufacturers come forward and say they can't meet the uh - amendments that the Congress has put forward, this Republican administration has delayed the implementation dates.	1
ClaimBuster	3822				Now, the problem is that they didn't think these things through properly.	1
ClaimBuster	3823				And - and that's a reversal of position uh by the Burger Court with which I do agree.	1
ClaimBuster	3824				I think you ought to have at least one answer to it.	0
ClaimBuster	3825				Number 2, if you don't rebuild the economic strength of this country at home, we won't be a superpower.	0
ClaimBuster	3826				What message does that send the Iraqis?	0
ClaimBuster	3827				This strategy requires additional troops, it requires a fundamental change in strategy and I fought for it.	1
ClaimBuster	3828				You have to work on this day in and day out, every month ,every year, every issue, to make sure that we have not only free trade but fair trade.	0
ClaimBuster	3829				He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them.	1
ClaimBuster	3830				You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit.	0
ClaimBuster	3831				You know, the President reminds me sometimes of my brother Kenny, who is no longer alive.	1
ClaimBuster	3832				These uh - kinds of specific things, uh none of which are being done now, would be a great help in - in reducing uh unemployment.	0
ClaimBuster	3833				Because of the president's decision today, law enforcement officers will walk into a place that will be more dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	3834				And you pick out 20,000, whether they need the money or not, and they get paid for volunteering.	1
ClaimBuster	3835				How much did you cut them by, then?	0
ClaimBuster	3836				In fact, it doesn't ask you to do anything -- if you don't want to take it, you don't have to.	0
ClaimBuster	3837				And we've got to -- to make sure that we have people who are trained interrogators so that we don't ever torture a prisoner ever again.	0
ClaimBuster	3838				China is now the largest manufacturer in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	3839				So you have to temper your decisions with the ability to beneficially affect the situation and realize you're sending America's most precious asset, American blood, into harm's way.	0
ClaimBuster	3840				They don't want this arms race.	0
ClaimBuster	3841				The President says that when the Democratic Party made its turn, he left it.	1
ClaimBuster	3842				We need to encourage programs such as Teach for America and Troops to Teachers where people, after having served in the military, can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which -- or have the certification that some are required in some states.	0
ClaimBuster	3843				There are more deductions in the tax code for shutting plants down and moving overseas than there are for modernizing plant and equipment here.	1
ClaimBuster	3844				We are asking for men and women to join the military as a career, and we're asking them to deal with the most sophisticated of equipment.	0
ClaimBuster	3845				Well, people got their checks, and they'll continue to get their checks.	1
ClaimBuster	3846				They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through.	0
ClaimBuster	3847				That's using a hatchet to cut the federal budget.	0
ClaimBuster	3848				The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations who don't presently have it, particularly terrorist nations.	0
ClaimBuster	3849				And that meant I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done.	0
ClaimBuster	3850				More than half of these 10 and a half million new jobs are in higher wage areas and we'll have more manufacturing and sales around the world.	1
ClaimBuster	3851				Builders and community leaders are ready.	0
ClaimBuster	3852				I happen to like the idea of having technology for the TV, easy for parents to use so you can tune out these programs you don't want in your house.	0
ClaimBuster	3853				And there are some parts of Dodd-Frank that make all the sense in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	3854				Uh - I obviously don't think it's valid.	0
ClaimBuster	3855				His top adviser on immigration is the guy who designed the Arizona law, the entirety of it; not E-Verify, the whole thing.	1
ClaimBuster	3856				So, why should we believe that they had placed that much more reliance on land-based?	0
ClaimBuster	3857				The ability to fight, if necessary, is the best way to avoid the chance for, or the requirement to fight.	0
ClaimBuster	3858				If I wanted to do that, why would I run for president, Jim?	0
ClaimBuster	3859				Look at the votes in the United Nations over the past seven and a half years.	0
ClaimBuster	3860				And, of course, as far as the how we make it better, yes, we can do better on interdiction.	0
ClaimBuster	3861				Well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	3862				In a recent 30-day period, 37 terrorist acts in 20 countries have been committed.	1
ClaimBuster	3863				This is what Ross Perot complains about.	0
ClaimBuster	3864				But I would propose holding that income up not through a type of program that Senator Kennedy has suggested that would raise prices, but one that would indemnify the farmer, pay the farmer in kind uh - from the products which are in surplus.	0
ClaimBuster	3865				And, again, I know those situations.	0
ClaimBuster	3866				The history in Colombia right now is that labor leaders have been targeted for assassination on a fairly consistent basis and there have not been prosecutions.	1
ClaimBuster	3867				I want to answer your question, but let me say one other thing.	0
ClaimBuster	3868				And I hope we can do better.	0
ClaimBuster	3869				I believe that we should not compare what our figures may be to India or some other country that has serious problems but to remember that we are the most prosperous country in the world and that these people are not getting adequate food.	1
ClaimBuster	3870				It's supposed to come from the people, it comes at the people.	0
ClaimBuster	3871				If our view prevails that we have to do more, that we have to make a greater national and international effort, that we have lost prestige in Latin America - the President of Brazil - the new incumbent running for office called on Castro during his campaign because he thought it was important to get the vote of those who were supporting Castro in Latin America.	1
ClaimBuster	3872				We are the greatest country on the face of the earth.	0
ClaimBuster	3873				We know how to set agendas.	0
ClaimBuster	3874				I hope you will look at the ideas in it.	0
ClaimBuster	3875				Thank you to Hofstra University and to Candy Crowley for organizing and leading this -- this event.	0
ClaimBuster	3876				It's a question of who they are.	0
ClaimBuster	3877				Let's look at the facts.	0
ClaimBuster	3878				See, for 45 years we were preoccupied with the Red Army.	1
ClaimBuster	3879				And, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and we've got to keep fighting, and I will defeat ISIS, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	3880				Seven administrations were dealing with Mr. Noriega.	1
ClaimBuster	3881				We've had millions of young men and women in subsequent subsequent wars change the face of the nation because the government helped with their education.	0
ClaimBuster	3882				Less than a hundred people have been working throughout the entire federal government on this subject, and I believe it's been reflected in our success and failures at Geneva.	1
ClaimBuster	3883				And that's why we're doing what we're doing.	0
ClaimBuster	3884				If it's good enough for us, it's good enough for every American.	0
ClaimBuster	3885				Can I make another point?	0
ClaimBuster	3886				You're putting a lot of business people out of business.	0
ClaimBuster	3887				It's illegal right now and has been for years for illegal immigrants to get welfare benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	3888				So it sounds great, but our targeted tax cut for education, child rearing, healthcare and home buying, which is paid for in my balanced budget plan, something that he has not done, certified by the Congressional budget office, that's the right way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	3889				Now, I've identified areas where we can, right away, make a change that I believe would actually help the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	3890				We've got to change the system.	0
ClaimBuster	3891				Jim, I had the great experience -- it didn't seem like it at the time -- of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat.	1
ClaimBuster	3892				We have concluded with Japan 21 -- about to be 22 -- trade agreements now.	1
ClaimBuster	3893				Now right here in Arizona, that difference would have been $131 million to the state of Arizona to help its kids be able to have better education and to lift the property tax burden from its citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	3894				If you didn't balance your budget, you went out of business.	0
ClaimBuster	3895				He chose a tax cut for wealthy Americans over the things that I listed to you.	0
ClaimBuster	3896				Well, Jim, I think every American in any position of responsibility should be concerned about what's happened.	0
ClaimBuster	3897				We've got 1,000 extra border patrol on the southern border; want 1,000 on the northern border.	1
ClaimBuster	3898				If we're going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be done at the local level or the state level.	0
ClaimBuster	3899				I want to take very dollar by which we reduce defense and reinvest it in technologies for the 21st century--in new transportation, in communication, in environmental clean-up technologies.	0
ClaimBuster	3900				When you don't have any ideas, you don't have any agenda, and all you have is fear, that's all you can use.	0
ClaimBuster	3901				You can look at the record.	0
ClaimBuster	3902				And for me, this is about jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	3903				And, by the way, she also understands special-needs families.	0
ClaimBuster	3904				We're seeing Iraq united as Iraqis, tough, hard, but we're seeing them.	0
ClaimBuster	3905				But I think it's time to talk about the future.	0
ClaimBuster	3906				... $4 billion tax benefit for your family.	1
ClaimBuster	3907				I know what it takes to make sure that you have the kind of opportunity you deserve.	0
ClaimBuster	3908				We have restored much of our economy.	1
ClaimBuster	3909				He's already got $3 trillion, according to The Washington Post, of expenses that he's put on the line from his convention and the promises of this campaign, none of which are paid for.	1
ClaimBuster	3910				We had a recession in fifty-four.	1
ClaimBuster	3911				We can't stand pat because it is essential with the conflict that we have around the world that we not just hold our own, that we not keep just freedom for ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	3912				The best way to defeat them is to never waver, to be strong, to use every asset at our disposal, is to constantly stay on the offensive and, at the same time, spread liberty.	0
ClaimBuster	3913				I am trying to provide leadership now, before the election, so that the American people can participate in that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	3914				Now, I voted for the Patriot Act.	1
ClaimBuster	3915				Why aren't you putting some money in?	0
ClaimBuster	3916				"And when Governor Romney says, the challenge is, ""Well Obama didn't try."""	0
ClaimBuster	3917				But under our constitution, if you show up tomorrow and obey the law, and you work hard and you do what you're supposed to do, you are entitled to equal treatment.	0
ClaimBuster	3918				And, look, this hasn't been an easy decision for me to meet.	0
ClaimBuster	3919				It's obvious that we still have a long way to go in fully incorporating the minority groups into the mainstream of American life.	0
ClaimBuster	3920				But I must tell you, I think legalization of narcotics, or something of that nature, in the face of the medical evidence, would be totally counterproductive.	0
ClaimBuster	3921				Ten million people have registered to vote in Afghanistan in the upcoming presidential election.	1
ClaimBuster	3922				And I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life.	1
ClaimBuster	3923				And Republicans and Democrats both love America.	0
ClaimBuster	3924				But if those Mom and Pop stores all get together and pool, they too can bring the cost of insurance down.	1
ClaimBuster	3925				And those grants which make it possible for states and local communities to clean up rivers and harbors and streams.	0
ClaimBuster	3926				And as governor of my state, I was able to get 100 percent of my people insured, all my kids, about 98 percent of the adults.	1
ClaimBuster	3927				Also I got a philosophical difference.	0
ClaimBuster	3928				I proposed a plan, detailed budget, that shows us cutting the deficit in half by five years.	1
ClaimBuster	3929				So that pledge isn't realistic, and I think the vice president knows it; I think the people of this country know it.	0
ClaimBuster	3930				It's hard work to go from a place where people get their hands cut off, or executed, to a place where people are free.	0
ClaimBuster	3931				They've held a torch for the world to see -- the torch of freedom and hope and opportunity.	0
ClaimBuster	3932				This is the major recommendation that he's made.	1
ClaimBuster	3933				It's to make sure our troops are well-housed and well-equipped.	0
ClaimBuster	3934				That's why I'm for Stealth technology, to build a Stealth bomber -- which I've supported for years -- that can penetrate the Soviet air defense system without any hope that they can perceive where it is because their radar system is frustrated.	0
ClaimBuster	3935				Whether it be fighting for an HMO patient's bill of rights.	0
ClaimBuster	3936				One of the things the next president must do is to remind people that if we are going to have a responsible period in America, that each of us must love our children with all our heart and all our soul.	0
ClaimBuster	3937				You pay $500 for a $5 hammer, you're not buying strength.	0
ClaimBuster	3938				To go back to the very, very first question.	0
ClaimBuster	3939				Bill of Rights - the fact that, by serving in the military, they could provide for a future college education.	1
ClaimBuster	3940				Modernize our schools, reduce class size, recruit new teachers, give every child a chance to learn with one-on-one time in a quality -- high-quality, safe school.	0
ClaimBuster	3941				And I do favor the death penalty.	0
ClaimBuster	3942				They're having to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments.	0
ClaimBuster	3943				I picked Lloyd Bentsen, because I thought he was the best qualified person for the job.	0
ClaimBuster	3944				And you have 30-some in your administration, either left or being investigated or in jail or whatever, then you've got an ethical problem.	1
ClaimBuster	3945				We're going to work with your employer to lower the cost of your premiums by up to $2,500 a year.	0
ClaimBuster	3946				Uh - I have uh - added in the current year budget the funds for the National Park Service.	1
ClaimBuster	3947				So we can do a better job of homeland security.	0
ClaimBuster	3948				I was the first United States president to visit Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	3949				We have to tell the truth.	0
ClaimBuster	3950				We had a war when we came into power in 1953.	1
ClaimBuster	3951				By Russia or anybody else.	0
ClaimBuster	3952				More in September than in August.	1
ClaimBuster	3953				I didn't do the most or run the greatest risk by a long shot, but I learned what it was like to be an enlisted man in the United States Army.	1
ClaimBuster	3954				Dick Cheney's counted as a small business.	1
ClaimBuster	3955				If we're lucky and we do it right, that could potentially happen but in the short term there's an outlay and we may not see that money for a while.	0
ClaimBuster	3956				And they're going now because of the policies of this administration.	0
ClaimBuster	3957				But I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	3958				You're familiar, I'm sure, with the recognition given in the Air Force to uh - General James, and there was just uh - approved a three-star admiral, the first in the history of the United States Navy, so uh - we are giving full recognition to individuals of quality in the Ford administration in positions of great responsibility.	1
ClaimBuster	3959				But the point is, also, on oil drilling, oil drilling offshore now is vital so that we can bridge the gap.	0
ClaimBuster	3960				Believed it in 1998 when Clinton was president.	0
ClaimBuster	3961				And perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our times is what do we do about these enormous deficits.	0
ClaimBuster	3962				I say -- I was joking with a veteran -- I hate to even go into this.	0
ClaimBuster	3963				And I believe strongly that we should have nominees to the United States Supreme Court based on their qualifications rather than any litmus test.	0
ClaimBuster	3964				This is the first time that I've - remember in the history of our country when we've let a foreign country circumvent or change our Bill of Rights.	1
ClaimBuster	3965				And when John talks about his non-inflationary plan, as far as I have been able to learn, there are 88 proposals in it that call for additional Government spending programs.	1
ClaimBuster	3966				And it is a fact in the August session that the four members of the Rules Committee who were Republicans joining with two Democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the House.	1
ClaimBuster	3967				And they are being slaughtered...	1
ClaimBuster	3968				But it's also put an enormous strain on our budget.	1
ClaimBuster	3969				You told him you wanted to spread the wealth around.	1
ClaimBuster	3970				I'm not going to go down there and try to dump the sludge from Massachusetts off the beaches off of New Jersey.	0
ClaimBuster	3971				We ask the people that are viewing tonight, are you better off than you were four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	3972				Please, join me in this cause to move confidently and with a sense of assurance and command to build the blessed future of our nation.	0
ClaimBuster	3973				I've negotiated at Vladivostok with uh - Mr. Brezhnev a limitation on the MIRVing of their ballistic missiles at a figure of thirteen-twenty, which is the first time that any president has achieved a cap either on launchers or on MIRVs.	1
ClaimBuster	3974				And give it to the president, and if the Congress isn't big enough to do it, let the president have a shot at this excess spending.	0
ClaimBuster	3975				We simply cannot ignore the fact that, in those cities today, we have 55% youth unemployment among black and Hispanic youth.	1
ClaimBuster	3976				That gap is going to close, because the Arabs, the Japanese and folks in this country are going to start buying German treasuries because they can get more money.	0
ClaimBuster	3977				That's going to be critical.	0
ClaimBuster	3978				We always had to reform it over the years, but we need somebody who believes it in to reform it.	0
ClaimBuster	3979				In the meantime, there has developed the problem of the Soviet Backfire - their high-performance aircraft which they say is not a long-range aircraft and which some of our people say is a intercontinental aircraft.	1
ClaimBuster	3980				Thank God I was up in the with Jimmy Baker camping out and I didn't have to hear all the personal attacks on me out of that Democratic convention.	0
ClaimBuster	3981				The first time -- and I did not criticize the President, because these things can happen -- once, and sometimes twice -- the second time the barracks in Lebanon were assaulted, as we all remember.	1
ClaimBuster	3982				That was more than we had offered to all of Africa before from the federal government.	1
ClaimBuster	3983				And what I want to do is to make sure that the plumber, the nurse, the firefighter, the teacher, the young entrepreneur who doesn't yet have money, I want to give them a tax break now.	0
ClaimBuster	3984				Our third century should be the century of individual freedom for all our two hundred and fifteen million Americans today and all that join us.	0
ClaimBuster	3985				I think we ought to have incentives to do it, I think we ought to push to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	3986				Perhaps we might find that out tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	3987				I'm asking the people's support as president.	0
ClaimBuster	3988				I think I remember the question.	0
ClaimBuster	3989				I don't want the law to supersede good law like we've got in Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	3990				We are a big industrial state.	1
ClaimBuster	3991				Trickle-down government has never worked here, has never worked anywhere.	1
ClaimBuster	3992				And so in order to take pressure off the borders, in order to make the borders more secure, I believe there ought to be a temporary worker card that allows a willing worker and a willing employer to mate up, so long as there's not an American willing to do that job, to join up in order to be able to fulfill the employers' needs.	0
ClaimBuster	3993				Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle.	1
ClaimBuster	3994				We increased them to China 50 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	3995				One final point if I might.	0
ClaimBuster	3996				In order to keep America the strongest nation in the world, we need some continuity and some change.	0
ClaimBuster	3997				It's a tool that law enforcement now uses to be able to talk between each other.	1
ClaimBuster	3998				They develop a positive or negative self- image.	0
ClaimBuster	3999				There's no doubt about it.	0
ClaimBuster	4000				And I -- look, I'm all in favor of green energy.	0
ClaimBuster	4001				And I would encourage the current administration to proceed with that kind of flexibility where it's appropriate and where it's done carefully and responsibly.	0
ClaimBuster	4002				Now, again, to get to whether I am depending on magic, I think I have talked in straight economic terms about a program of recovery that I was told wouldn't work.	0
ClaimBuster	4003				Our Air Force is older and smaller than at any time since it was founded in 1947.	1
ClaimBuster	4004				You remember the last debate?	0
ClaimBuster	4005				Now, the math doesn't work, but he continues to claim that he's going to do it.	1
ClaimBuster	4006				Of course, we can take a hatchet and a scalpel to this budget.	0
ClaimBuster	4007				And I believe that he will be outstanding.	0
ClaimBuster	4008				Who's he gonna listen to -- us or the folks running up and down the aisles with money, the lobbyists, the PAC money?	0
ClaimBuster	4009				Uh - let me uh - talk about uh - the economic announcements that were made just this past week.	0
ClaimBuster	4010				And you know, I don't think age is the only criterion.	0
ClaimBuster	4011				And here in a country which if it is moving ahead, if it's developing its economy to the fullest - which we are not now - in my judgment, we'll have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	4012				And I've been supporting those and I know how to fix this economy, and eliminate our dependence on foreign oil, and stop sending $700 billion a year overseas.	1
ClaimBuster	4013				She's not doing any me favors.	0
ClaimBuster	4014				The SALT II treaty was the result of negotiations that Mr. Carter's team entered into after he had asked the Soviet Union for a discussion of actual reduction of nuclear strategic weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	4015				It's time to end it.	0
ClaimBuster	4016				You fill the prescription and Medicare pays half the cost.	1
ClaimBuster	4017				I'm not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food - some of it rotting - even though there is a hungry world, and even though four million Americans wait every month for a food package from the government, which averages five cents a day per individual.	1
ClaimBuster	4018				Now, here's what I want to do.	0
ClaimBuster	4019				Folks on Social Security who've worked all their lives.	0
ClaimBuster	4020				He's deployed more troops than any president in history around the world.	1
ClaimBuster	4021				How anyone could think that any sane person would believe you could call back a nuclear missile, I think is as ridiculous as the whole concept has been.	0
ClaimBuster	4022				That's what governors end up doing.	0
ClaimBuster	4023				And it's going to be tough.	0
ClaimBuster	4024				Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS.	1
ClaimBuster	4025				Now, as for the proposals that I've worked for for renewables and conservation and efficiencies and new technologies.	0
ClaimBuster	4026				And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991.	1
ClaimBuster	4027				I want to expand our markets abroad and that's why I've called for that first economic summit to be on agriculture.	0
ClaimBuster	4028				It did not do what it needed to do.	0
ClaimBuster	4029				In fact, I think just the opposite.	0
ClaimBuster	4030				It calls for a mutual reduction of these weapons, as I say, that neither of us can represent a threat to the other.	0
ClaimBuster	4031				It's probably the reason that I'm in politics.	0
ClaimBuster	4032				And if we're going to do some of the things you mentioned, like lowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it.	0
ClaimBuster	4033				What we do is we have choice.	0
ClaimBuster	4034				There -- there are people in Iran who have the same aspirations as people all around the world for a better life.	1
ClaimBuster	4035				We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very -- I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	4036				Well, Fiora (ph), I'm going to ask the American people to understand that there are some programs that we may have to eliminate.	0
ClaimBuster	4037				I said that I would work for tax relief for middle class Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	4038				And we're going to enforce those agreements, and we're going to look for businesses to help us by buying American products.	0
ClaimBuster	4039				Well, the Administration was the first major country to stand up to the abuse in Tiananmen Square.	1
ClaimBuster	4040				In fact, it's estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you're looking at 50 million people losing health insurance...	1
ClaimBuster	4041				Medicaid's in one agency; Medicare is in a different one.	1
ClaimBuster	4042				I can run this more efficiently than the federal government and states, by the way, are proving it.	0
ClaimBuster	4043				Am I trying to indicate that we have no problems in Africa or Latin America or Asia?	0
ClaimBuster	4044				Panama is a friendly country.	0
ClaimBuster	4045				In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow-down in our economy, which helped bring the recession of fifty-four; which made the recession of fifty-eight rather intense, and which has slowed, somewhat, our economic activity in 1960.	0
ClaimBuster	4046				And I recommend a spending freeze that -- except for defense, Veterans Affairs, and some other vital programs, we'll just have to have across-the-board freeze.	0
ClaimBuster	4047				I am particularly concerned about the intercontinental weapons, the ones that can hit us.	0
ClaimBuster	4048				So we know what he has said and what he's done to women.	0
ClaimBuster	4049				I talked to him about how best to expedite the exploration of natural gas in Mexico and transport it up to the United States so we become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil.	1
ClaimBuster	4050				I have worked so hard out here to help turn this economy around.	1
ClaimBuster	4051				The president nominates, and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process.	0
ClaimBuster	4052				They have funded Hezbollah, they have funded Hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon.	1
ClaimBuster	4053				I do want to say that I was just endorsed -- and more are coming next week -- it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here -- admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country.	1
ClaimBuster	4054				I would like to tell you something about me.	0
ClaimBuster	4055				That's what he stated, again, a matter of record.	1
ClaimBuster	4056				I thought the administration was at the negotiating table in Geneva suggesting that we ban mobile missile systems entirely.	0
ClaimBuster	4057				The basic decision of the Supreme Court is that each person has to make this judgment in her own life, and that's the way it's been done.	1
ClaimBuster	4058				And the reason is was so important -- and this is a testament to how we've restored American credibility and strength around the world -- is we had to make sure that all the countries participated, even countries like Russia and China.	0
ClaimBuster	4059				He said trickle-down economics was voodoo economics; now he's it's biggest practitioner.	1
ClaimBuster	4060				When Mr. Nixon went in office, for instance, we had three and a half million dollars spent on - on the White House and its staff.	1
ClaimBuster	4061				On foreign affairs, some think it's irrelevant.	0
ClaimBuster	4062				He makes that decision when he commits young men or young women who are going to go round and defend our liberty and our freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	4063				It's the wrong thing to do.	0
ClaimBuster	4064				He says we ought to have gun-free schools.	1
ClaimBuster	4065				This is my point tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	4066				But, look, the nature of the challenges that we're going to face are immense and one of the things that we know about the presidency is that it's never the challenges that you expect.	0
ClaimBuster	4067				In addition we can have more exchange with Poland or with any other of the Iron Curtain countries which show some desire to take a different path than the path that has been taken by the ones that are complete satellites of the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	4068				You don't buy any gun.	0
ClaimBuster	4069				We have committed $200 million worth of aid.	1
ClaimBuster	4070				In the Far East I think we need to continue to be uh - strong and uh - I would certainly uh - pursue the uh - normalization of uh - relationships with the People's Republic of China.	0
ClaimBuster	4071				This is how I'm going to get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	4072				I told her after we prayed and teared up and laughed some that I thought her husband's sacrifice was noble and worthy.	1
ClaimBuster	4073				And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	4074				And therefore, if I only had another second left, I'd say that that high school class in a military training - 40 of its 80 graduates last year entered the United States service academies; West Point, Annapolis and the Air Force Academy, and to see those young men made me very proud to realize that there are young people in this country that are prepared to go into that kind of a career in service of their country.	1
ClaimBuster	4075				The Patriot Act is necessary, for example, because parts of the FBI couldn't talk to each other.	1
ClaimBuster	4076				I believe that the cruise missiles which we are now developing in research and development across the spectrum from air, from the sea, or from the land, uh - can be uh - included within a SALT II agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	4077				I want a Supreme Court that doesn't always side with corporate interests.	0
ClaimBuster	4078				His influence is growing - mostly because this Administration has ignored Latin America.	1
ClaimBuster	4079				He just declared it dead, ladies and gentlemen, and we walked away from the work of 160 nations over 10 years.	1
ClaimBuster	4080				I've sat across the table from people who were out of work and worked with them to try and find new work or to help them through tough times.	1
ClaimBuster	4081				I think if Barbara Bush were running this year she'd be elected.	0
ClaimBuster	4082				I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion.	0
ClaimBuster	4083				George Bush, a few years ago, said that Social Security was basically a welfare system.	1
ClaimBuster	4084				We're providing that young woman with help.	0
ClaimBuster	4085				It well describes the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	4086				I believe in local control of schools.	0
ClaimBuster	4087				We need to have a very carefully thought through phase-over.	0
ClaimBuster	4088				I know because we did it there.	0
ClaimBuster	4089				There is a very strong moral basis for this concept of equality of opportunity.	0
ClaimBuster	4090				Supposing we had - had a Democratic Congress for the last two years and we'd had uh - Governor Carter as President.	0
ClaimBuster	4091				I picked Lloyd Bentsen, distinguished, strong, mature, a leader in the Senate, somebody whose qualifications nobody has questioned.	1
ClaimBuster	4092				The fact is that my health-care plan, America, is very simple.	0
ClaimBuster	4093				I also believe that we need to say to people that if you cannot meet standards, there has to be a consequence.	0
ClaimBuster	4094				But she wanted to look good for the election.	0
ClaimBuster	4095				I'm going to fight for a fair trade playing field for the American worker.	0
ClaimBuster	4096				First time one state had been number one in all four measures.	1
ClaimBuster	4097				What we can't do, I think, is try to characterize each other as bad people.	0
ClaimBuster	4098				I'll give you everything I have, if you want me to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	4099				If we want to stop crime and teenage pregnancy, let's start with education.	0
ClaimBuster	4100				But what is absolutely true is that, once we get through this economic crisis and some of the specific proposals to get us out of this slump, that we're not going to be able to go back to our profligate ways.	0
ClaimBuster	4101				And I'm very proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	4102				The Dorgan Task Force, which included two internal revenue commissioners, one a Republican, one a Democrat.	1
ClaimBuster	4103				We have to bring back law and order.	0
ClaimBuster	4104				Teddy Roosevelt used to say walk softly -- talk softly, but carry a big stick.	1
ClaimBuster	4105				And with regards to young people coming along, I've got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question.	0
ClaimBuster	4106				I want a check-off, so if the Congress can't do it, let people check off their income tax, 10% of it, to compel the government to cut spending.	0
ClaimBuster	4107				He's going to probably go to jail.	0
ClaimBuster	4108				We've had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies.	0
ClaimBuster	4109				Greatly expand character education funding so that public schools will teach children values, values which have stood the test of time.	0
ClaimBuster	4110				So what we said was you can't just sit on this for 10, 20, 30 years, decide when you want to drill, when you want to produce, when it's most profitable for you.	0
ClaimBuster	4111				Yes, that's true, I didn't.	1
ClaimBuster	4112				During the Clinton years, as you may recall, there was a fight over affirmative action.	1
ClaimBuster	4113				I don't believe in big government, but I believe in effective governmental action.	0
ClaimBuster	4114				It also means that we've got to make sure that young people like yourself are able to afford a college education.	0
ClaimBuster	4115				You know, when Senator Obama ended up his conversation with Joe the plumber -- we need to spread the wealth around.	0
ClaimBuster	4116				But it was simply wrong to finance their last scheme to cut Medicare $270 billion to run the risk of it withering on the vine.	0
ClaimBuster	4117				And I'm sorry to tell you that, you know, there is a record here.	1
ClaimBuster	4118				And so to make sure we end up getting rid of basic structural prejudice is education.	0
ClaimBuster	4119				There were a whole bunch of oil companies.	0
ClaimBuster	4120				And I do, both for corporations and for individuals.	0
ClaimBuster	4121				The American people now are facing, next Tuesday, a lonely decision.	0
ClaimBuster	4122				I said we're going to bet on American workers and the American auto industry and it's come surging back.	1
ClaimBuster	4123				I want my fellow Americans to hear one more time.	0
ClaimBuster	4124				If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun.	0
ClaimBuster	4125				We are once again reliable suppliers and I would never use food as a political tool like our predecessors did.	1
ClaimBuster	4126				Let them reach out beyond the confines of the current structure to recruit teach-for-the-children type teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	4127				And the financial rescue plan that Senator McCain and I supported is an important first step.	0
ClaimBuster	4128				"He went to Cincinnati and he gave a speech in which he said, ""We will plan carefully."	1
ClaimBuster	4129				If the American people send me up to do this job, I intend to be there one term.	0
ClaimBuster	4130				So there was a lot at stake there.	0
ClaimBuster	4131				I have made a lot of decisions, and some of them little, like appointments to boards you never heard of, and some of them big.	1
ClaimBuster	4132				While we were still dealing with our diplomats being threatened, Governor Romney put out a press release, trying to make political points, and that's not how a commander in chief operates.	1
ClaimBuster	4133				No, because they've always wanted this to be an American effort.	1
ClaimBuster	4134				It makes sure that the people coming across the border are humanely treated, that they're not kept in the shadows of our society, that they're able to go back and forth to see their families.	1
ClaimBuster	4135				See the millions of these killings accumulate, and this is one where you can have an honest difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	4136				And the biggest threat facing America is terrorists with weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	4137				I apologize for it but that one got right to the national honor and I'm sorry.	0
ClaimBuster	4138				You know, my hero is a guy named Teddy Roosevelt.	0
ClaimBuster	4139				Drug use has doubled the past 44 months all across America.	1
ClaimBuster	4140				She just went about 25 seconds over her time.	1
ClaimBuster	4141				And I also believe, sir, that the most personal intimate decision that any woman is ever called upon to make is the decision as to whether or not she shall carry a pregnancy to term.	0
ClaimBuster	4142				I want to move ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	4143				This president has never once vetoed one bill; the first president in a hundred years not to do that.	1
ClaimBuster	4144				I have been for border security for years.	1
ClaimBuster	4145				If the president has any interest tonight, I'll detail it to you; I won't take 10 minutes tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	4146				Saddam Hussein was a threat because he could have given weapons of mass destruction to terrorist enemies.	0
ClaimBuster	4147				I just described what my plan is.	1
ClaimBuster	4148				Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	4149				Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, who's one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with Iran -- guess what -- without precondition.	1
ClaimBuster	4150				But part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence.	0
ClaimBuster	4151				It's just like you said in Texas one day, you know raised taxes too much, and you did, and you cut defense too much, Mr. President, and you did.	1
ClaimBuster	4152				And that position is that the United States has a treaty - a treaty with all of the Organization of American States - which prohibits us from interfering in the internal affairs of any other state and prohibits them as well.	1
ClaimBuster	4153				What I'm not for is us ignoring the other half of the equation.	0
ClaimBuster	4154				After that, once again, our Embassy was exploded.	1
ClaimBuster	4155				Now, Senator McCain talks a lot about earmarks.	1
ClaimBuster	4156				I laid out seven steps, crippling sanctions were number one.	1
ClaimBuster	4157				What I want America to do is to trade more but to compete and win by investing in competitive ways.	0
ClaimBuster	4158				We do that all the time.	0
ClaimBuster	4159				I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them.	1
ClaimBuster	4160				Either he's for the President and he's against the position that those who opposed the President in fifty-five and fifty-nine - and the Senator's position itself, stated the other day in our debate - either he is for the President and against that position or we simply have a disagreement here that must continue to be debated.	0
ClaimBuster	4161				I want to thank everybody who watched and listened tonight because this is indeed a crucial time in American history.	0
ClaimBuster	4162				And under me, when I lead this country, the secretary of defense is going to have to make the choices, between how we keep, how we protect the survivability of our nuclear deployment on the Midgetman missile, or on the Minuteman, whatever it is.	0
ClaimBuster	4163				I believe in protecting America first.	0
ClaimBuster	4164				And I think that we're better off, for example with the Philippines, of trying to retain our friendship and help them right the wrongs we see, rather than throwing them to the wolves and then facing a Communist power in the Pacific.	0
ClaimBuster	4165				And Senator McCain during that period said that we should keep on deregulating because that's how the free enterprise system works.	1
ClaimBuster	4166				I think if we learned anything in Vietnam is you first commit this nation before you commit the troops to the battlefield.	0
ClaimBuster	4167				I mentioned before that the local communities are having a harder time passing bond issues.	0
ClaimBuster	4168				I put people behind bars for the rest of their life.	1
ClaimBuster	4169				Then we took comments, as we always do, and there were tens of thousands of comments as to how we ought to do it.	1
ClaimBuster	4170				...and -- and that's why I have the kind of commitment to ensure that our industries in this country can compete and be successful.	0
ClaimBuster	4171				The whole world is having economic difficulties.	1
ClaimBuster	4172				If a local school district in Cleveland or anyplace else wants to have a private choice plan like Milwaukee did, let them have at it.	0
ClaimBuster	4173				With regard to business investment, it is higher than it has been since 1949.	1
ClaimBuster	4174				... to oil, to tax breaks, then companies going overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	4175				You will have the finest health care plan there is.	0
ClaimBuster	4176				We've had 4 years where we've produced no private sector jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	4177				Well -- well, let me give you an example of what Senator Obama finds objectionable, the business tax.	0
ClaimBuster	4178				Well, I just want to say...	0
ClaimBuster	4179				These kinds of things have hurt us very much.	0
ClaimBuster	4180				I know the governor's not necessarily saying that but, you know, all of these flights that have come in, all of them have been in accordance with the sanctions regime, I'm told, except for three where they notified, and they're trying to break out of the box, there's no question about it.	1
ClaimBuster	4181				I must remind him the Democrats have controlled the Congress for the last twenty-two years and they wrote all the tax bills.	1
ClaimBuster	4182				Another thing that we need to do is to reestablish the good relationships that we ought to have between the United States and our natural allies and friends.	0
ClaimBuster	4183				There've been over thirteen hundred indictments in HUD, over eight hundred convictions relating just to home loans.	1
ClaimBuster	4184				And by the way, I've done these things.	1
ClaimBuster	4185				Is anybody being discriminated against?	0
ClaimBuster	4186				We got together seven Republicans, seven Democrats.	1
ClaimBuster	4187				We need to be talking about space.	0
ClaimBuster	4188				But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune.	1
ClaimBuster	4189				But I can tell you that I think America is safer today than it was on 9/11.	0
ClaimBuster	4190				We don't have an adequate requirement for the insulation of homes, for the efficiency of automobiles.	0
ClaimBuster	4191				Will we have equal pay for women, which is going backwards?	0
ClaimBuster	4192				It's all those businesses that employ one-quarter of the workers in America; these small businesses that are taxed as individuals.	1
ClaimBuster	4193				What means something is: Do you have a plan?	0
ClaimBuster	4194				I voted against it; Senator Obama voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	4195				But let's at least focus...	0
ClaimBuster	4196				Reductions of that kind will not permit the United States to be strong enough to deter aggression and maintain the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	4197				But that does not mean that we will cease to protect the rights of the unborn.	0
ClaimBuster	4198				India started from about the same place that China did.	0
ClaimBuster	4199				And I want to honor that among his other achievements here.	0
ClaimBuster	4200				Being haunted, a thousand points of light - I don't know what that means.	0
ClaimBuster	4201				One of the overwhelming results that I've seen in the polls is that people feel that you can't plan anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	4202				That's why we're losing -- we're losing -- we lose on everything.	0
ClaimBuster	4203				I did the right decision.	0
ClaimBuster	4204				And the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate.	1
ClaimBuster	4205				What do you think they're going to do when the campaign's over?	0
ClaimBuster	4206				And with the plan that -- that I have, that will do that.	0
ClaimBuster	4207				This is supposed to be the year of the women in the Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	4208				Now incidentally, I should point out here that Senator Kennedy has attacked our foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	4209				The American people are up to here with debates.	0
ClaimBuster	4210				Now, I know Donald Trump doesn't like to think of himself as small anything, but -- but that's how you define small businesses if you're getting business income.	0
ClaimBuster	4211				For instance, some that have been forgotten; we need to have the reactor core - below ground level, the entire power plant that uses atomic uh - power tightly sealed and a heavy - heavy vacuum maintained.	0
ClaimBuster	4212				Again Governor Carter is inaccurate.	0
ClaimBuster	4213				If you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go to Congress, fight for it.	0
ClaimBuster	4214				Senator Obama talks about voting for budgets.	1
ClaimBuster	4215				He can't come here and tell you that he's left no child behind because he didn't fund no child left behind.	1
ClaimBuster	4216				The reason Magic Johnson resigned from the AIDS Commission is because the statement you heard tonight from Mr. Bush is the longest and best statement he's made about it in public.	1
ClaimBuster	4217				You can't stop all outsourcing, Charlie.	0
ClaimBuster	4218				But we have to use our military wisely.	0
ClaimBuster	4219				If laws need to be strengthened, like instant background checks, that's important.	0
ClaimBuster	4220				As far as our other issues that he brought up are concerned, I know the veterans.	0
ClaimBuster	4221				I met a young woman in -- in Philadelphia who's coming out of -- out of college, can't find work.	1
ClaimBuster	4222				All of that would be lost if we followed Senator Obama's plan to have specific dates with withdrawal, regardless of conditions on the ground.	0
ClaimBuster	4223				And it's a long list of specific items.	0
ClaimBuster	4224				For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns.	1
ClaimBuster	4225				And believe me, everybody on the factory floor all over this country knows it.	0
ClaimBuster	4226				This debate tonight has made crystal clear a challenge that is as old as America -- the choice between hope and fear, change or more of the same, the courage to move into a new tomorrow or to listen to the crowd who says things could be worse.	0
ClaimBuster	4227				Perhaps that oil abroad should be treated differently than the oil here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	4228				And I understand that we have to say never again to a Holocaust and never again to Rwanda.	0
ClaimBuster	4229				And I've got to tell you that vouchers, where they are requested and where they are agreed to, are a good and workable system.	0
ClaimBuster	4230				You're going to have 120 to 150 new members of Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	4231				That means those cars can be exported, 'cause that's the demand around the world, and it also means that it'll save money in your pocketbook.	1
ClaimBuster	4232				I will bring back jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	4233				That's going to help to create jobs here.	0
ClaimBuster	4234				When I walked into the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion-dollar deficit greeting me.	1
ClaimBuster	4235				Otherwise, the world won't be better off.	0
ClaimBuster	4236				Or will we have a world of peace with the threat of atomic weapons eliminated, with full trade, with our people at work, inflation controlled, openness in government, our people proud once again, Congress, citizens, president, secretary of state working in harmony and unity toward a common future?	0
ClaimBuster	4237				We're not going to go unilaterally.	0
ClaimBuster	4238				I think most people know that I did not seek the presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	4239				We have it on tape.	1
ClaimBuster	4240				The integration of Central and Eastern European democracies into a new partnership with NATO.	1
ClaimBuster	4241				We also are pursuing housing programs.	1
ClaimBuster	4242				I -- I just have to correct the record here.	0
ClaimBuster	4243				How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	4244				"It's called ""Make America Great Again."""	1
ClaimBuster	4245				And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	4246				And this is known oil reserves, known supplies.	0
ClaimBuster	4247				And it really is the cost, the escalating costs of health care that are inflicting such pain on working families and people across this country.	0
ClaimBuster	4248				Meanwhile, we started the -- also in '93 to look into whether cigarettes were addictive enough for the Federal Food and Drug Administration to ban the ability of cigarette companies to advertise, market and distribute their products to our kids.	1
ClaimBuster	4249				I served it uh - in the war.	1
ClaimBuster	4250				I think it's interesting to point out that uh - in the uh - two years that I've been president I've vetoed fifty-six bills.	1
ClaimBuster	4251				I'm going to change that.	0
ClaimBuster	4252				You know, that's been stretched by the pro-abortion movement in America to mean almost anything.	0
ClaimBuster	4253				I know you probably would oppose it, Mr. President, but I think we should have a fairer system and a flatter system, and we'll have a fairer and flatter system and we're going to make the economic package work.	0
ClaimBuster	4254				The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.	0
ClaimBuster	4255				And as a matter of principle -- and my situation is unique, and I understand it -- I would take absolutely no compensation; I go as their servant.	0
ClaimBuster	4256				We had a guarantee -- and what happened?	0
ClaimBuster	4257				Mr. Kraft, I believe that the American people, in the next four years under a Ford administration, will be called upon to make those necessary sacrifices to preserve the peace which we have.	0
ClaimBuster	4258				One of my disagreements with the present Administration has been that I don't feel a real effort has been made an this very sensitive subject, not only of nuclear controls, but also of general disarmament.	1
ClaimBuster	4259				So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation.	0
ClaimBuster	4260				I have sat down with Democrats and Republicans at the beginning of my term.	1
ClaimBuster	4261				Because has won the support of a great many people all over the state and I think it's a model for what I hope we can do across the country.	0
ClaimBuster	4262				If people would say, well, he got elected to do this and then the Congress says, okay, I'm going to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	4263				But this is an exciting time.	0
ClaimBuster	4264				We're working through the international organizations.	0
ClaimBuster	4265				We have to be willing to make good, sound judgments.	0
ClaimBuster	4266				... no troops through whatsoever.	1
ClaimBuster	4267				One, of course, is to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	4268				And you go visit some of those kids in the hospitals today who were maimed because they don't have the armament.	0
ClaimBuster	4269				Bill Clinton tried the approach that I'm talking about.	1
ClaimBuster	4270				When I got involved, I didn't fail.	1
ClaimBuster	4271				That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting.	1
ClaimBuster	4272				And the president is moving to the creation of our own bunker- busting nuclear weapon.	1
ClaimBuster	4273				We lost three thousand American lives.	1
ClaimBuster	4274				The question, I think, should be enlarged.	0
ClaimBuster	4275				I say that to both political parties.	0
ClaimBuster	4276				We saw that message in the late 70s when heard a lot about change, and what happened, that misery index went right through the roof.	1
ClaimBuster	4277				He's 70 years old, has high blood pressure, his wife has heart trouble.	1
ClaimBuster	4278				He's also shown a weakness in yielding to pressure.	0
ClaimBuster	4279				Well, it was not one of my ads, either, Governor.	1
ClaimBuster	4280				So what one hand giveth, the other hand taketh away.	0
ClaimBuster	4281				The proposal advanced by you and by Mr. Javits would have cost six hundred millions of dollars - Mr. Rockefeller rejected it in New York, said he didn't agree with the financing at all, said it ought to be on Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	4282				Now, I will not allow somebody to come in and change Roe v. Wade.	0
ClaimBuster	4283				Our international competitors that are cleaning our plate have an intelligent relationship between government and business, and a supportive relationship.	0
ClaimBuster	4284				And I will cut taxes for middle-class families.	0
ClaimBuster	4285				It is not a good deal for the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	4286				And yet they were polled by the U.S.I.A.	1
ClaimBuster	4287				But my experience -- my experience the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost.	0
ClaimBuster	4288				So if the farmers' economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country.	0
ClaimBuster	4289				I will say this -	0
ClaimBuster	4290				So the problem is - it's not that the working is being taxed too little or the person working out - the woman working in some factory being taxed too little.	0
ClaimBuster	4291				Now we tried to do this under President Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	4292				I would not favor the uh - payment of uh - of a given fixed income to people unless they are not able to work.	0
ClaimBuster	4293				My wife Tipper, who is here, actually went on a military plane with General Sholicatchvieli on one of those flights.	1
ClaimBuster	4294				And that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds.	0
ClaimBuster	4295				And when we haven't done it, as in North Korea -- let me just take one more example -- in North Korea, we cut off talks.	1
ClaimBuster	4296				But to add one other feature, I don't control any of the tapes.	1
ClaimBuster	4297				Let me say that this is one of the most important issues in the world to me.	0
ClaimBuster	4298				Those are very clear differences.	0
ClaimBuster	4299				Now, he says he's only going to tax the rich.	1
ClaimBuster	4300				And that example that President Eisenhower has set we will continue to follow.	0
ClaimBuster	4301				... a very clear fact that...	0
ClaimBuster	4302				There are things we can do like the Kassebaum bill.	0
ClaimBuster	4303				In San Diego where we had some defense cutbacks, we funded a project for the University of California San Diego to use airplane composite materials to build lighter, stronger bridges, a little project in a program that Senator Dole opposed.	1
ClaimBuster	4304				We cannot let it happen.	0
ClaimBuster	4305				We created partnerships throughout the region to deal with extremism in Somalia, in Yemen, in Pakistan.	1
ClaimBuster	4306				This is a very important issue we're talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	4307				Im- most importantly, consumer confidence as surveyed by the reputable organization at the University of Michigan is at the highest since 1972.	1
ClaimBuster	4308				We've been remarkably successful, with the help of a Democratic Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	4309				India under a free society has been making some progress.	1
ClaimBuster	4310				And that is not reflected in the kind of budget that you're putting forward because it just doesn't work.	0
ClaimBuster	4311				Go out and take a look at St. Louis at some of that effort.	0
ClaimBuster	4312				When you're the president of the United States, you have a public trust and you have to keep that public trust, as George Washington, as Abraham Lincoln did.	0
ClaimBuster	4313				For 38 years one party has controlled the House of Representatives, and the result, a sorry little post office that can't do anything right and a bank that has more overdrafts than all the Chase Bank and Citibank put together.	1
ClaimBuster	4314				More than that, it was the first national security decision that we had to make.	1
ClaimBuster	4315				And I believe that -- that we ought to recognize the value to our children and grandchildren of taking steps that preserve the environment in a way that's good for them.	0
ClaimBuster	4316				I believe in freedom of choice.	0
ClaimBuster	4317				And that was, we had adequate warning that there was a threat to our embassy, and we could have done what other embassies did - either strengthen our security there, or remove our personnel before the kidnap and the takeover took place.	1
ClaimBuster	4318				You've got one more energy -- you've got one more question.	0
ClaimBuster	4319				There ought to be a standardized design.	0
ClaimBuster	4320				But -- and I say that about a lot of things.	0
ClaimBuster	4321				And so I say in conclusion, keep America's faith strong.	0
ClaimBuster	4322				Now, I've listed the things that I think have to be at the top of the list.	0
ClaimBuster	4323				Number three, the pre - Vice President suggests that we should keep the Communists in doubt about whether we would fight on Quemoy and Matsu.	0
ClaimBuster	4324				We ought to appoint a commission, just as we did in Social Security in 1983, when we rescued Social Security, and I was proud to be on that commission, along with Claude Pepper, the champion of senior citizens from Florida.	1
ClaimBuster	4325				There are some changes that I would like to make.	0
ClaimBuster	4326				It's not Social Security plus, it's Social Security plus huge debt.	0
ClaimBuster	4327				Not only that, you named the day.	1
ClaimBuster	4328				But just take a look at the positions of the ACLU.	0
ClaimBuster	4329				Now, what's wrong with Star Wars?	0
ClaimBuster	4330				They have good people and they play constructive roles sometimes, but sometimes they get too much power.	0
ClaimBuster	4331				In fact, it was a Republican idea.	1
ClaimBuster	4332				If you create Saddam Hussein, over a 10-year period, using billions of dollars of US taxpayer money, step up to the plate and say it was a mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	4333				But the fact is that we need to absolutely not stand for the kind of things that have been going on.	0
ClaimBuster	4334				The best way to defend America in this world we live in is to stay on the offense.	0
ClaimBuster	4335				I would reach out to our allies in a way that this president hasn't.	0
ClaimBuster	4336				I have helped to balance the budget for the first time in 30 years, paid down the debt.	1
ClaimBuster	4337				...and $500 billion over the next five.	1
ClaimBuster	4338				There are guys that couldn't get a job third shift in a Dairy Queen driving BMWs and Mercedes selling drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	4339				I will not let that happen.	0
ClaimBuster	4340				Well, we have a comparison that we can make.	0
ClaimBuster	4341				I've been trying so hard not to.	0
ClaimBuster	4342				Those are the people who in the 1980s had their incomes go up while their taxes went down.	1
ClaimBuster	4343				But I'm very -- that's one of the real success stories here of the work we've done.	0
ClaimBuster	4344				And it was major -- a major factor in bringing about the end of the Cold War.	0
ClaimBuster	4345				He and his running-mate didn't show up to vote when they could have got it going in the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	4346				We're going to have regulatory -- we're gonna have litigation reform.	0
ClaimBuster	4347				The offshore drilling rights is a question that Governor Reagan raises often.	1
ClaimBuster	4348				Well, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.	1
ClaimBuster	4349				It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people.	0
ClaimBuster	4350				Met Mr. Shevardnadze and talked substance with him the other day.	1
ClaimBuster	4351				Fox the other day in New Hampshire, who's suffering from Parkinson's, and he wants us to do stem cell, embryonic stem cell.	1
ClaimBuster	4352				And I have a record -- and Somalia, I opposed that we should turn -- turn the force in Somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force, which they were not capable of.	1
ClaimBuster	4353				Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives.	0
ClaimBuster	4354				I've worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America.	1
ClaimBuster	4355				I've said that eight years ago they campaigned on prescription drugs for seniors.	1
ClaimBuster	4356				Oh, I'm a pretty calm guy.	0
ClaimBuster	4357				It's sort of ad hoc, just whatever comes up, we'll deal with it.	0
ClaimBuster	4358				And that is, I wouldn't join the International Criminal Court.	0
ClaimBuster	4359				And she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the United States?	0
ClaimBuster	4360				In terms of regional tensions, we have now gotten the attention of the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	4361				We've got Guards and Reserves who are doing double duties.	1
ClaimBuster	4362				Now, when JFK said we're going to the Moon in 10 years, nobody was sure how to do it, but we understood that, if the American people make a decision to do something, it gets done.	1
ClaimBuster	4363				When you've got seven and a half, eight million people out of work, and you've got three times as much inflation as you had during the last eight-year Democratic administration, when you have the highest deficits in history; when you have it uh - becoming increasingly difficult far a family to put a child through college or to own a home, there's a natural inclination to be turned off.	1
ClaimBuster	4364				I believe in its greatness.	0
ClaimBuster	4365				It was a bipartisan approach, but it's been rejected.	1
ClaimBuster	4366				Why I'll win is I think I have the best plan of the 3 of us up here to do something about it.	0
ClaimBuster	4367				It's good for small businesses, good for owners.	0
ClaimBuster	4368				And it isn't really higher prices, it's just, you are reducing the value of the money.	0
ClaimBuster	4369				The only involvement I've had with ACORN was I represented them alongside the U.S. Justice Department in making Illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people get registered at DMVs.	1
ClaimBuster	4370				She said a lot of things that were false.	1
ClaimBuster	4371				We can get into a war by letting events get out of hand, as they have in the last three and a half years under the foreign policies of this Administration of Mr. Carter's, until we're faced each time with a crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	4372				That if given a chance to be free, they will show up at the polls.	0
ClaimBuster	4373				Now I cannot, and would not, endorse the kind of program that uh - Governor Carter recommends.	0
ClaimBuster	4374				They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care.	1
ClaimBuster	4375				These constant suggestions that the basic Social Security System should be changed does call for concern and consternation among the aged of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	4376				I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief.	1
ClaimBuster	4377				And I believe that we can together do things that are within the grasp of Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	4378				Uh I call that the people amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	4379				He now says he's going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don't have to worry.	1
ClaimBuster	4380				Again I say, think of the Americans with Disabilities Act.	0
ClaimBuster	4381				Well let me make one thing clear.	0
ClaimBuster	4382				I think we still need affirmative action.	0
ClaimBuster	4383				Fifteen months ago, he was a cosigner and advocating the very tax cut that I am proposing, and said that that would be a forward step in fighting inflation, and that it would be beneficial to the working people of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	4384				That wasn't proven when Ronald Reagan said we would do SDI, which is missile defense.	1
ClaimBuster	4385				Strong families need a strong economy.	0
ClaimBuster	4386				We're going to have trade agreements that we enforce.	0
ClaimBuster	4387				Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	4388				In some of the discussions we've had about when it's appropriate for the U.S. to use force around the world, at times the standards that you've laid down have given me the impression that if it's something like a genocide taking place or what they called ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, that that alone would not be, that that wouldn't be the kind of situation that would cause you to think that the U.S. ought to get involved with troops.	0
ClaimBuster	4389				We did come forward with a program of students for the Congo of over three hundred which was more than the federal government had for all of Africa the previous year, so that I don't think that uh - we have moved at least in those two areas with sufficient vigor.	1
ClaimBuster	4390				It's a gateway to out-of-control spending and corruption.	0
ClaimBuster	4391				We want to make certain we protect those in the pipeline just as we did back in 1983 and we did it on a bipartisan basis.	0
ClaimBuster	4392				No, I'm saying our principal need now is to stabilize the tax base, which is the job base, and create a growing, dynamic base.	0
ClaimBuster	4393				And frankly, I think we have a lot more loving of our neighbor to do in this country and on this planet.	0
ClaimBuster	4394				I'm sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine, here -- here with me.	0
ClaimBuster	4395				I know what it's like to rely on others for support and courage and love in tough times.	0
ClaimBuster	4396				I've seen it authoritatively written twice, and if I've done him an injustice, and he didn't say it, I'm very, very sorry.	0
ClaimBuster	4397				Why don't we stop this madness now and draw a line and keep the heavens free from war?	0
ClaimBuster	4398				The war started in 2003, and at the time when the war started, you said it was going to be quick and easy.	1
ClaimBuster	4399				I do not intend to spend one minute of one day thinking about re-election.	0
ClaimBuster	4400				And therefore Congress passes the bill after our session in 1997 ended, we passed an enabling legislation in 1999.	1
ClaimBuster	4401				And I believe we're all children of the same God.	0
ClaimBuster	4402				And when it comes to our military and Chinese security, part of the reason that we were able to pivot to the Asia-Pacific region after having ended the war in Iraq and transitioning out of Afghanistan, is precisely because this is going to be a massive growth area in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	4403				And I think that's a private matter.	0
ClaimBuster	4404				As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we're talking about potentially a 30 -- a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time.	1
ClaimBuster	4405				And that's where there's been a great uh generation of despair, and ill health, and the lack of education, lack of purposefulness, and the lack of hope for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	4406				But that in and of itself was a good thing.	0
ClaimBuster	4407				And I think I'm more in touch with the mainstream of America.	0
ClaimBuster	4408				I was opposed to the war.	1
ClaimBuster	4409				I happen to believe that the Federal Government has usurped powers of autonomy and authority that belong back at the state and local level.	0
ClaimBuster	4410				... have a good time, folks.	0
ClaimBuster	4411				And I know these campaigns get knocked a lot, but I think I'd be a better President now for having had to travel to these communities and understand the family values and the importance of neighborhood.	0
ClaimBuster	4412				On the third time we sent welfare reform to the president he signed it but announced he would change it next year, and the vice president said they were going to do something else through the line item veto which I've never understood, but that's sort of inside baseball.	1
ClaimBuster	4413				That's having a government from the people.	0
ClaimBuster	4414				In athletics, we know it.	0
ClaimBuster	4415				And for all the rest of the parents in America who are wondering about their kids going to the school or anywhere else in the world, what kind of world they're going to grow up in, let me look you in the eye and say to you: I defended this country as a young man in war, and I will defend it as president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	4416				If you stop the drugs, nobody is going to use the drugs; so don't smoke, don't drink, don't use drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	4417				The education is a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	4418				Tax reform is relevant for old and young alike.	0
ClaimBuster	4419				With regard to a platform on the Supreme Court, I can only say one thing about that.	0
ClaimBuster	4420				But to have a situation, as you mentioned in our earlier comments, that the most expensive education in the world is in the United States of America also means that it cries out for reform, as well.	1
ClaimBuster	4421				That's not appropriate to do.	0
ClaimBuster	4422				But I don't think there's anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country and assisting our family farms and providing a good strong future for rural communities and for rural America and at the same time working on Third World debt.	0
ClaimBuster	4423				The farmers were the victims of the double-digit inflation and the 211/2-percent interest rates of the Carter-Mondale administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier.	1
ClaimBuster	4424				I don't see how you can lead this country in a time of war, in a time of uncertainty, if you change your mind because of politics.	0
ClaimBuster	4425				But I do think that Saddam Hussein is stronger than he was.	0
ClaimBuster	4426				One-third of the president's budget is at the president's discretion, or really the Congress, since they appropriate every dime and tell a president how to spend every dime.	1
ClaimBuster	4427				So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.	1
ClaimBuster	4428				The thing that separates my candidacy and makes it unique is that this came from millions of people in 50 states all over this country who wanted a candidate that worked and belonged to nobody but them.	0
ClaimBuster	4429				I'd also like to see the overtime laws change so that we could have some more flex time so that at the discretion of the worker, the worker, if you earn overtime, you could decide when you want that time to be taken, in cash or in time with your family if you've got a family problem.	0
ClaimBuster	4430				I would wind up -- I mean, it's the last question and I would mischaracterize it to try to make you happy.	0
ClaimBuster	4431				And she speaks English a lot better than I do.	0
ClaimBuster	4432				And we are making sure that those we help are those who will be friends of ours in the long term and friends of our allies in the region over the long term.	0
ClaimBuster	4433				When George Bush came into office, we had surpluses.	1
ClaimBuster	4434				So you, dear voters, are out there on the auction block, and these two candidates are bidding for your votes.	0
ClaimBuster	4435				But I want to go back to 1965.	0
ClaimBuster	4436				That's just flat wrong, and that's not what America is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	4437				... we can't -- we have not seen Republicans serious about this issue at all.	0
ClaimBuster	4438				I'm not going to appoint a judge to the Court who's going to undo a constitutional right, whether it's the First Amendment, or the Fifth Amendment, or some other right that's given under our courts today -- under the Constitution.	0
ClaimBuster	4439				I wasn't the one that said 5.4 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	4440				Four, in the votes at the U.N., particularly the vote dealing with Red China last Saturday, we received the support on the position that we had taken of only two African countries - one, Liberia, which had been tied to us for more than a century, and the other, Union of South Africa, which is not a popular country in Africa.	1
ClaimBuster	4441				This is a decision that the president of the United States must make.	0
ClaimBuster	4442				Question really is who do you want in the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	4443				And it's a big fight.	0
ClaimBuster	4444				That's what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.	0
ClaimBuster	4445				I submit to you that as you look at his programs, his program for example with regard to the Federal Reserve and uh - free money or loose money uh - high - low interest rates, his program in the economic field generally are the programs that were adopted and tried during the Truman Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	4446				This is the private market.	1
ClaimBuster	4447				What we need to do is go after...	0
ClaimBuster	4448				I think it's a triumph.	0
ClaimBuster	4449				So here's what we do.	0
ClaimBuster	4450				You know, some parents are worried about those filters, that you will have to ask your kids how to put them on there.	1
ClaimBuster	4451				You'll get your chance in a moment.	0
ClaimBuster	4452				And so, we made a proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	4453				For what purpose it was put in place, I can't imagine.	0
ClaimBuster	4454				There are all kinds of ways to create jobs in the inner city.	0
ClaimBuster	4455				Well I failed to mention North Korea and Cuba, a while ago.	1
ClaimBuster	4456				But when -- when Governor Romney says that he'll replace it with something, but can't detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isn't a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem.	1
ClaimBuster	4457				Since then, he has blamed the people for inflation, OPEC, he has blamed the Federal Reserve system, he has blamed the lack of productivity of the American people, he has then accused the people of living too well and that we must share in scarcity, we must sacrifice and get used to doing with less.	0
ClaimBuster	4458				Not only has an innocent person been executed, but the real perpetrator of the crime has not been held accountable for it.	1
ClaimBuster	4459				Nine out of 10 active-duty Army divisions are either in Iraq, going to Iraq or have come back from Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	4460				When you√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢re a senior official in the federal government spending billions of dollars in taxpayer√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s money and you√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢re a mature individual and you make a mistake, then that was on our ticket.	0
ClaimBuster	4461				I would not work hard to support any of those.	0
ClaimBuster	4462				But there are many people who I admire in this country today.	0
ClaimBuster	4463				Now, maybe we made a wrong turn with Kennedy, but I'll be proud of supporting him all of my life.	0
ClaimBuster	4464				Senator Dole has two or three times before tonight criticized me for working with the U.N. Now I'm being criticized for not working with the U.N.	1
ClaimBuster	4465				We're not making things anymore, relatively speaking.	0
ClaimBuster	4466				So it could end up having an adverse effect on everybody, and that's why we had to take action.	0
ClaimBuster	4467				That was the right thing to do.	0
ClaimBuster	4468				Number one, we can do this through the African Union, providing we give them the logistical support.	0
ClaimBuster	4469				I don't want to have our military involved in Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	4470				And so, we've got to introduce high technology into health care.	0
ClaimBuster	4471				And that means, of course, the best man that this nation can produce.	0
ClaimBuster	4472				And I think that something can be done from there, because a goal for all of us should be that one day, things will be done neither because of nor in spite of any of the differences between us - ethnic differences or racial differences, whatever they may be - that we will have total equal opportunity for all people.	0
ClaimBuster	4473				This election will also determine what kind of world we leave our children.	0
ClaimBuster	4474				I think that, if you look at the record and the impressions of the American people -- Bob, your network just did a poll, showing that two-thirds of the American people think that Senator McCain is running a negative campaign versus one-third of mine.	1
ClaimBuster	4475				That's why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians.	0
ClaimBuster	4476				We're talking about drugs made right here in the United States of America that have American brand names on them and American bottles.	0
ClaimBuster	4477				Well, Mr. Nixon hasn't discussed the two basic questions: what is going to be done and what will be his policy on implementing the Supreme Court decision of 1954?	0
ClaimBuster	4478				Fourthly, I believe we should not carry out a hard money, high interest rate policy which helped intensify certainly the recession of 1958, and I think helped bring the slow-down of 1960.	0
ClaimBuster	4479				I will make a commitment to bring health care coverage of high quality that is affordable to every single child in America within four years.	0
ClaimBuster	4480				With decent and affordable healthcare for all working families.	0
ClaimBuster	4481				But here's what I said.	0
ClaimBuster	4482				But we need to have leadership -- leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if -- if it's a Republican or a Democrat.	0
ClaimBuster	4483				When I became president I used the authority I had in this law to get out from certain federal rules to help states move people to work.	1
ClaimBuster	4484				When I'm President of the United States, we're going to use the National Guard and whatever sources we need to stop some of the drugs coming into America.	0
ClaimBuster	4485				And when it comes to this issue, when I say that we are going to find out exactly what happened, everybody will be held accountable.	0
ClaimBuster	4486				We have in -- in Egypt, a Muslim Brotherhood president.	1
ClaimBuster	4487				I voted for the Formosa resolution in 1955.	1
ClaimBuster	4488				And sound fiscal policy is the best answer, I think, to all the three problems you mentioned.	0
ClaimBuster	4489				I hope we can succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	4490				And he's got a lot of experience, but so do I.	1
ClaimBuster	4491				Women work for 76 cents on the dollar for the same work that men do.	1
ClaimBuster	4492				I agree with her on one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	4493				I am answering your questions.	0
ClaimBuster	4494				In the case of the Helsinki agreement - it may have been a good agreement at the beginning, but we have failed to enforce the so-called basket three part, which insures the right of people to migrate, to join their families, to be free, to speak out.	1
ClaimBuster	4495				And when it comes to South Korea, we've got a trade agreement up right now, they are sending hundreds of thousands of South Korean cars into the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	4496				The basic problem with it, it doesn't balance the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	4497				It's what leadership is based on.	0
ClaimBuster	4498				So I think what was wrong -- I give credit where credit is due -- but the responsibility was in coddling Saddam Hussein when there was no reason to do it and when people at high levels in our government knew he was trying to do things that were outrageous.	1
ClaimBuster	4499				Its growth rate is not what counts; it's whether it is catching up with us and it is not catching up with us.	0
ClaimBuster	4500				I think they'll choose it, because it's a net plus of $5 billion to them.	1
ClaimBuster	4501				The right to vote is basic.	0
ClaimBuster	4502				Sometimes they didn't come out with a clear regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	4503				But I want to be a president of the United States who makes sure that we never again do business with a drug-running Panamanian dictator, that we never again funnel aid to the contras through convicted drug dealers.	0
ClaimBuster	4504				How do we prevent attacks?	0
ClaimBuster	4505				So this -- this is not -- this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get America energy secure.	0
ClaimBuster	4506				Number two, seeing a -- a replacement government being responsible people is critical for us.	0
ClaimBuster	4507				He did not say that.	1
ClaimBuster	4508				Social Security is in surplus $70 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	4509				My definition of national strength is to make certain that a dollar spent buys us a dollar's worth of defense.	0
ClaimBuster	4510				A growing, expanding job base to generate the funds and the tax revenues to pay off the mess and rebuild America.	0
ClaimBuster	4511				We arm to parley, Winston Churchill said ten years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	4512				No longer do we give an image of vitality.	0
ClaimBuster	4513				We had the slowest growth, about 2.5 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	4514				Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	4515				We've lost in our foreign policy, the character of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	4516				In fact, he's done the opposite.	1
ClaimBuster	4517				Now, let me just go back with you very briefly.	0
ClaimBuster	4518				Now, when Senator McCain is proposing tax cuts that would give the average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts, that's not sharing a burden.	1
ClaimBuster	4519				And -- and so we -- we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet.	1
ClaimBuster	4520				He'd just said Jim Baker was going to be secretary of state and in the first debate he said no, now he's gonna be responsible for domestic economic policy.	1
ClaimBuster	4521				Senator Obama, I am not President Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	4522				When it comes to bridges, I want a bridge to the future.	0
ClaimBuster	4523				You take a look at all the programs you've advocated, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	4524				You can take a look at the op-ed...	0
ClaimBuster	4525				95% of all seniors would get no help whatsoever under my opponent's plan for the first four or five years.	1
ClaimBuster	4526				And we have to get the very most of uh - out uh - out of our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	4527				And our state cares a lot about our children.	0
ClaimBuster	4528				It had to do with the discussion we had had the previous day on the overall question of reducing the budget.	0
ClaimBuster	4529				But, Peter, so much of it is, gets into a whole other phase of things.	0
ClaimBuster	4530				Every 18-year-old can go to college.	0
ClaimBuster	4531				Last point I want to make, though.	0
ClaimBuster	4532				And she was in the hospital, and I went in to talk to her and tell her what I was thinking of doing.	1
ClaimBuster	4533				Our jobs are fleeing the country.	1
ClaimBuster	4534				We're not making those choices.	0
ClaimBuster	4535				Now, I have to tell you, I would do something different.	0
ClaimBuster	4536				So we can't ignore those lessons of history.	0
ClaimBuster	4537				I think under those circumstances they would refrain from pushing us to our knees as they did in 1973 with their previous oil embargo.	1
ClaimBuster	4538				I've chuckled a few times at some of their comments.	1
ClaimBuster	4539				We built more houses in the last seven years than in any Administration and thirty percent more than in the previous Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	4540				It'd be fine with me.	0
ClaimBuster	4541				First of all, it's a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution which President Clinton defeated.	1
ClaimBuster	4542				And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing.	1
ClaimBuster	4543				They've got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing.	0
ClaimBuster	4544				And I think that the Constitution has a right to privacy in it that shouldn't be subject to state referendum, any more than our First Amendment rights are subject to state referendum, any more than many of the other rights that we have should be subject to popular vote.	0
ClaimBuster	4545				And off-shore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge.	0
ClaimBuster	4546				I thought it would be better for the country than it was.	0
ClaimBuster	4547				I'm talking about the one that was proposed to deal --	0
ClaimBuster	4548				There are no nuclear missiles pointed at the children of the United States tonight and have not been in our administration for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age.	1
ClaimBuster	4549				But I am not for doing anything that would affect hunters or sportsmen, rifles, shotguns, existing handguns.	0
ClaimBuster	4550				I was against -- I was against the war in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	4551				And he defined that as someone who uses beans in place of meat.	1
ClaimBuster	4552				Thirdly, spread what's called health savings accounts.	0
ClaimBuster	4553				But generally I believe that a president has to be willing to do what he thinks is right.	0
ClaimBuster	4554				So, my formula says grow at the rate of inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	4555				We've got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	4556				Under the new bill, if I had signed it, a person like that could never have had any recovery.	1
ClaimBuster	4557				How does he avoid conflict?	0
ClaimBuster	4558				And when the phrase a strict constructionist is used and when the names of Scalia and Thomas are used as the benchmarks for who would be appointed, those are code words, and nobody should mistake this, for saying the governor would appoint people who would overturn Roe v. Wade.	1
ClaimBuster	4559				After 9/11, we had to recognize that when we saw a threat, we must take it seriously before it comes to hurt us.	0
ClaimBuster	4560				Inflation is robbing us, as we've already discussed, and the government bureaucracy is uh - just a horrible mess.	0
ClaimBuster	4561				You know, he always is looking for some conspiracy.	0
ClaimBuster	4562				And, as I say, we've had tough economic times, and it's exports that have saved us, exports that have built.	1
ClaimBuster	4563				Now with respect to a couple of things Senator McCain said, the notion that I voted for a tax increase for people making $42,000 a year has been disputed by everybody who has looked at this claim that Senator McCain keeps on making.	1
ClaimBuster	4564				That's one that I understand and certainly will carry out.	0
ClaimBuster	4565				The person who wants to use a gun for an illegal purpose can get it whether it's registered or outlawed.	0
ClaimBuster	4566				A president sets the strategy and relies upon good military people to execute that strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	4567				I have indicated to General Brown that uh - the words that he used in that interview, in that particular case and in several others, were very ill advised.	1
ClaimBuster	4568				I want to make more people like that woman, Lily Harden, so I've got a plan to do it, and it's just beginning.	0
ClaimBuster	4569				He said he did the right thing then, he knew it wouldn't work at the time.	1
ClaimBuster	4570				But if we're moving in the right direction and America is leading, we're better off.	0
ClaimBuster	4571				He also expressed the hope that there should be some understanding of the general situation in Berlin.	1
ClaimBuster	4572				But the best thing we can do now, Bob, given the circumstances with the company in England is for those of us who are younger and healthy, don't get a flu shot.	0
ClaimBuster	4573				We have a budget deficit in the federal government, but we also have an investment, a jobs, an income deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	4574				Allowing the new bill that was passed in the Congress made sense to allow for, you know, drugs that were sold overseas to come back and other countries to come back into the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	4575				But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA.	0
ClaimBuster	4576				It's a matter of being tough.	0
ClaimBuster	4577				And you're entitled to know where we would take this country if you decide to elect us.	0
ClaimBuster	4578				It's an enormous problem and corruption in official agencies, like militaries and police departments around the world, customs officials, that's one of the worst forms of it.	0
ClaimBuster	4579				He came in with a high growth rate, the 1990 budget agreement, which some, you know, didn't like, had some very tough cost controls, put a lot of pressure on Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	4580				I led the fight to put 100,000 cops on the streets of America.	1
ClaimBuster	4581				As a matter of fact, Mr. Bush was the Chairman of a task force on international terrorism which issued a report shortly before that decision was made and said, and rightly so, that we never ever can make concessions to terrorists and hostage takers.	1
ClaimBuster	4582				I think they're matters of very deep conviction, as far as many, many people in this country believe.	0
ClaimBuster	4583				Then you get what you want, and shouldn't you?	0
ClaimBuster	4584				So I just want to give a lot of things -- and just to respond.	0
ClaimBuster	4585				She has made bad judgment not only on taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	4586				And unfortunately again I regret this administration has not seized them and embraced them.	0
ClaimBuster	4587				We have the highest foreign debt in history.	1
ClaimBuster	4588				Let me tell you, if she's president of the United States, nothing's going to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	4589				And if it gets overturned, then we'll end up with marriage being defined by courts, and I don't think that's in our nation's interests.	1
ClaimBuster	4590				And that will lead to another five star migraine headache down the road.	0
ClaimBuster	4591				Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	4592				And we've probably got two and a half more million people who are not looking for jobs any more, because they've given up hope.	1
ClaimBuster	4593				There is a difference, though, as to what the economy has meant.	0
ClaimBuster	4594				Governor, the problem is, is that on a whole range of issues, whether it's the Middle East, whether it's Afghanistan, whether it's Iraq, whether it's now Iran, you've been all over the map.	0
ClaimBuster	4595				We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	4596				I'm caught in the middle on NAFTA.	1
ClaimBuster	4597				Again and again, on complex, difficult tasks, I have stayed the course.	0
ClaimBuster	4598				We have to have energy independence, so I've put forward a plan to make sure that, in 10 years' time, we have freed ourselves from dependence on Middle Eastern oil by increasing production at home, but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy, solar, wind, biodiesel, making sure that we're developing the fuel-efficient cars of the future right here in the United States, in Ohio and Michigan, instead of Japan and South Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	4599				We hadn't put al Qaeda to rest, and as a consequence, I thought that it was going to be a distraction.	0
ClaimBuster	4600				Let me tell you what your plan is.	0
ClaimBuster	4601				I argued that we should reverse that trend and take it back up.	1
ClaimBuster	4602				And we will do that.	0
ClaimBuster	4603				What he did in Moscow, that's fine.	0
ClaimBuster	4604				Ten years ago he served and I served on a school reform board that was funded by one of Ronald Reagan's former ambassadors and close friends, Mr. Annenberg.	1
ClaimBuster	4605				And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place.	1
ClaimBuster	4606				He's one of the wealthiest Americans, and he's our Vice President.	1
ClaimBuster	4607				I was just endorsed by ICE.	1
ClaimBuster	4608				So we ought to at least get the facts out here on the table so we can know where to go from here.	0
ClaimBuster	4609				I don't think the Fed ought to be put under the Executive Branch.	0
ClaimBuster	4610				I voted against that at the National Governors Association.	1
ClaimBuster	4611				He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	4612				We did try to bring Saddam Hussein into the family of nations; he did have the 4th largest army.	1
ClaimBuster	4613				Remains to be seen, however, whether or not there's going to be a political settlement in Kosovo, and I certainly hope there is one.	0
ClaimBuster	4614				Well, I think I did a much better job.	0
ClaimBuster	4615				We cannot do it any longer, Lester.	0
ClaimBuster	4616				And one last point I want to make about Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	4617				But now we have a chance.	0
ClaimBuster	4618				I've done a lot of them, and I'll continue to do them as president.	1
ClaimBuster	4619				And I need -- we need to have education and training programs for displaced workers that work, going to our community colleges.	0
ClaimBuster	4620				I don't believe in liberal activist judges.	0
ClaimBuster	4621				Small businessmen and businesswomen who paid 70 percent of your ninteen , your$265 billion tax increase, the largest tax increase in the history of America.	1
ClaimBuster	4622				I am going to help the inner cities.	0
ClaimBuster	4623				Wages and incomes have gone down.	1
ClaimBuster	4624				We still gave tax cuts to 15 million working Americans, and now I've got a plan that's been out there for two years, it could have been passed already, but instead the Republicans shut the government down to try to force their budget and their plan on me, and I couldn't take that.	1
ClaimBuster	4625				And Haitians have their problems, but we gave them a chance to restore democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	4626				The price of electricity is up.	1
ClaimBuster	4627				We've got to have a growing, expanding job base to give us a growing, expanding tax base.	0
ClaimBuster	4628				He's opposed every effort of every President to do so, and in the 4 years of his administration he's failed to do so.	1
ClaimBuster	4629				Veterans who've sacrificed for this country.	0
ClaimBuster	4630				You should know as much as possible about each of us.	0
ClaimBuster	4631				He'll tell you he's raised the money, and he has.	0
ClaimBuster	4632				But I will go out there and find men and women to interpret.	0
ClaimBuster	4633				They set a low standard of materialism.	0
ClaimBuster	4634				In the seven years before this Administration came into power in Washington, we found that six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain.	1
ClaimBuster	4635				And now what we have to do is to focus on those things we're real good at and make sure we're getting a fair deal.	0
ClaimBuster	4636				We've got to provide moral support to the Poles and Estonia and Latvia and all of the nations that were former Soviet satellites.	0
ClaimBuster	4637				Convert from 19th to 21st century capitalism.	0
ClaimBuster	4638				We have to make it the number one priority.	0
ClaimBuster	4639				Now what greater admission is there, 16 months afterwards.	0
ClaimBuster	4640				I think you know that these last four years haven't been so good as the president just described and that you don't feel like your confident that the next four years are going to be much better either.	0
ClaimBuster	4641				It really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have.	0
ClaimBuster	4642				My friends, we are not going to be able to provide the same benefit for present-day workers that we are going -- that present-day retirees have today.	0
ClaimBuster	4643				I give a new incentive for younger workers to save their own money and invest their own money, but not at the expense of Social Security, on top of Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	4644				And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or they'll be able to get a private plan.	0
ClaimBuster	4645				We can have enough clean energy to power every home.	1
ClaimBuster	4646				"They're not going to follow somebody who says, ""This is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time."""	0
ClaimBuster	4647				But before I answer further, let me thank you for moderating.	0
ClaimBuster	4648				It's like having a blueprint for a house you never built.	0
ClaimBuster	4649				We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty.	1
ClaimBuster	4650				Recognize -- I believe that Assad must go.	0
ClaimBuster	4651				What we need is good, strong leadership going in the next century.	0
ClaimBuster	4652				But let's sort of keep this out of politics because it's pretty dicey right now.	0
ClaimBuster	4653				223,000 kids in Arizona have no health insurance at all.	1
ClaimBuster	4654				And let's keep -- never forget the struggle that Americans are in today.	0
ClaimBuster	4655				But what I've also said is that now that you have a democratically elected government in Egypt, that they have to make sure that they take responsibility for protecting religious minorities.	1
ClaimBuster	4656				I wasn't happy when we found out there wasn't weapons, and we've got an intelligence group together to figure out why.	1
ClaimBuster	4657				But if they do -- if they do, it's easy to fix.	0
ClaimBuster	4658				And then in those nations, and on Arabic TV, you said that America had been dismissive and derisive.	1
ClaimBuster	4659				We both use similar language to reach an exactly opposite outcome.	0
ClaimBuster	4660				And if nothing else gets you excited about rebuilding our industrial base maybe that will because job one is to put our people back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	4661				You talk about women and women's rights?	0
ClaimBuster	4662				I have a plan to put America back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	4663				If we had a disaster today, could they handle it?	0
ClaimBuster	4664				And now we have half-a-trillion-dollar deficit annually.	1
ClaimBuster	4665				I haven't gotten a flu shot, and I don't intend to because I want to make sure those who are most vulnerable get treated.	1
ClaimBuster	4666				And many of the things the President talked about, he turned over to the United Nations.	0
ClaimBuster	4667				How is our credibility with the GCC countries on the Western side of the Gulf.	0
ClaimBuster	4668				Uh - We're using about fifty percent of our steel capacity today.	1
ClaimBuster	4669				Now, with respect to Darfur, yes, it is a genocide.	1
ClaimBuster	4670				If somebody came to you, Governor, with a plan that said, here, I want to spend $7 or $8 trillion, and then we're going to pay for it, but we can't tell you until maybe after the election how we're going to do it, you wouldn't take such a sketchy deal and neither should you, the American people, because the math doesn't add up.	0
ClaimBuster	4671				That's already offered in the private marketplace.	1
ClaimBuster	4672				I must remind him that we're at peace and during the period that he brags about unemployment being low, the United States was at war.	1
ClaimBuster	4673				We have got to stop sending jobs overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	4674				I'm not suggesting it will be done, but at least we ought to look at it.	0
ClaimBuster	4675				Well I would first say he should have been tackling it for the last seven years.	0
ClaimBuster	4676				I think we've got a lot more work to do.	0
ClaimBuster	4677				I did not say that.	1
ClaimBuster	4678				I said from the beginning that we ought to continue research into the strategic system at about the level that was added in 1983, that's about a billion dollars a year.	1
ClaimBuster	4679				"... extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, ""I can't do it."	0
ClaimBuster	4680				We do not have to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	4681				The defense budget today takes far less percentage of the gross national product than it did in President Kennedy's time, for example moved tremendously.	1
ClaimBuster	4682				It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.	0
ClaimBuster	4683				I've had the same test.	0
ClaimBuster	4684				We're going to have to develop clean coal technology and safe ways to store nuclear energy.	0
ClaimBuster	4685				You know, I fell off a platform out in California, Chico, a while back.	1
ClaimBuster	4686				But let me just say to all of America: if you hate people, I don't want your vote.	0
ClaimBuster	4687				No, no, no, but I could say, you know, that I ran a small grocery store on the corner, therefore I extrapolate that into the fact that I can run Wal-Mart.	1
ClaimBuster	4688				I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	4689				Somebody who understands that there're real Americans out there with real problems, whether soccer moms, or the single parents, the families or the seniors, or people with disabilities, whoever it may be.	0
ClaimBuster	4690				Look at the mess that we're in.	0
ClaimBuster	4691				How do you do it?	0
ClaimBuster	4692				Now, just back on this -- on this tax, you know, again, it's back to our first question here about rhetoric and record.	0
ClaimBuster	4693				It is -- it is a huge problem.	0
ClaimBuster	4694				You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	4695				Seventy-five percent of his people have been brought to justice.	1
ClaimBuster	4696				"They say, ""We feel like we're under attack from our own government."""	1
ClaimBuster	4697				I'm telling you, I will make it the -- I will make the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform bill the very first measure that I send to the Congress as president.	0
ClaimBuster	4698				These countries can't develop if young women are not given the kind of education that they need.	0
ClaimBuster	4699				Again, well it's, you are very selective, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	4700				The question is who makes the decision.	0
ClaimBuster	4701				And one of the areas, of course, is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil.	0
ClaimBuster	4702				We retained control as though we had sovereignty.	1
ClaimBuster	4703				We just had the election there.	1
ClaimBuster	4704				Because I was a senator with a Republican president.	1
ClaimBuster	4705				Barbara's sitting over here and I -- but what I have proposed, 10% cut, downsize the government, and we can get that done.	1
ClaimBuster	4706				And I'm sitting there and saying, well, who else could be around, you know?	0
ClaimBuster	4707				And that is, that we cannot look at this as simply a national problem.	0
ClaimBuster	4708				I am a graduate of the U.S.	1
ClaimBuster	4709				Bad health care at the most expensive price.	0
ClaimBuster	4710				It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.	0
ClaimBuster	4711				We need to expand our exports, and they're going very, very well, indeed.	0
ClaimBuster	4712				Before beginning my closing remarks, here, I would just like to remark a concern that I have that we have criticized the failures of the Carter policy here rather considerably, both of us this evening.	0
ClaimBuster	4713				In the same way that you say you would have ended the war in Iraq, but recently gave a speech saying that we should have 20,000 more folks in there.	1
ClaimBuster	4714				overlapping, aren't those the real costs?	0
ClaimBuster	4715				Let's take the example that the President cites.	0
ClaimBuster	4716				That's the enemy that was allowed to walk out of those mountains.	0
ClaimBuster	4717				The biggest complaint they have -- it's with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	4718				We have to stop the spending.	0
ClaimBuster	4719				And we're going to keep working to help Haiti...	0
ClaimBuster	4720				The control of these weapons is the single major responsibility of a President, and to cast out this commitment of all Presidents, because of some slight technicalities that can be corrected, is a very dangerous approach.	0
ClaimBuster	4721				I vetoed that bill because it cut more Medicare and and basically ran the risk of breaking up the system.	1
ClaimBuster	4722				I -- I don't know where John is getting his figures.	0
ClaimBuster	4723				Like the vice president, I call on Chairman Arafat to have his people pull back to make the peace.	1
ClaimBuster	4724				The first -- the first -- the first -- and we kept our schools number one in the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	4725				I understand in his last speech before the Steelworkers Union, that he changed that position and indicated that he felt that government seizure might be the best way to stop a strike which could not be settled by collective bargaining.	1
ClaimBuster	4726				Now, the final point I'll make on this whole issue of government intrusion and mandates -- it is absolutely true that I think it is important for government to crack down on insurance companies that are cheating their customers, that don't give you the fine print, so you end up thinking that you're paying for something and, when you finally get sick and you need it, you're not getting it.	0
ClaimBuster	4727				I think what it means to build consensus.	0
ClaimBuster	4728				And I think it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again.	0
ClaimBuster	4729				You know, this man has no credibility on the issue.	0
ClaimBuster	4730				You can't discriminate in the rights that you afford people.	0
ClaimBuster	4731				I can't protect an Arkansas company, you notice there, Governor.	0
ClaimBuster	4732				It denigrates an alliance to say we're going alone, to discount their sacrifices.	0
ClaimBuster	4733				And we'll find and we'll spend the money, research, to find the cause of autism.	0
ClaimBuster	4734				So we talk about all these new jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	4735				It would far surpass the numbers you mentioned.	1
ClaimBuster	4736				I'm saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs, and I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention.	0
ClaimBuster	4737				We have attempted to persuade Chiang Kai-shek as late as January of 1959 to reduce the number of troops he has on them.	1
ClaimBuster	4738				And most of the time, I learn it by asking her.	0
ClaimBuster	4739				The coal that the President mentioned - yes, we have it - and yet one-eighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at all right now.	1
ClaimBuster	4740				We're going to cut business taxes massively.	0
ClaimBuster	4741				So gun laws are important, no question about it, but so is loving children, and character education classes, and faith-based programs being a part of after-school programs.	0
ClaimBuster	4742				And using that base of strength, and using the idealism, the honesty, the predictability, the commitment, the integrity of our own country, that's where our strength lies.	0
ClaimBuster	4743				I'm absolutely convinced we can do it.	0
ClaimBuster	4744				I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under.	1
ClaimBuster	4745				And finally, number five, we've got to champion small business.	0
ClaimBuster	4746				We can't do it just in the schools.	0
ClaimBuster	4747				As for saving energy and conserving, the American people haven't been doing badly at that.	0
ClaimBuster	4748				Religion has been a huge part of my life.	0
ClaimBuster	4749				We're also going to have to have a farm more effective and comprehensive strategy to help move the world away from terror and Islamic extremism.	1
ClaimBuster	4750				But again, I did not hear a repudiation of Congressman...	0
ClaimBuster	4751				And I believe both a free Afghanistan and a free Iraq will serve as a powerful example for millions who plead in silence for liberty in the broader Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	4752				I have been a governor of a big state, I have made education my number one priority.	1
ClaimBuster	4753				And that's the way I've conducted myself as Governor of Texas and that's the way I'll conduct myself as President of the United States, should I be fortunate enough to earn your vote.	0
ClaimBuster	4754				Now, for three occasions, one after another, our Embassies were assaulted in the same way by a truck with demolitions.	1
ClaimBuster	4755				No, I don't believe it's going to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	4756				But then after the immediate action is taken, I believe the president has an obligation to tell the American people the truth and not wait eighteen months later for the report to be issued.	0
ClaimBuster	4757				It goes back to the founding of our country.	1
ClaimBuster	4758				How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county?	0
ClaimBuster	4759				We have the sources here.	0
ClaimBuster	4760				And you cannot keep both promises.	0
ClaimBuster	4761				You couldn't even have been a cardiologist because he had quotas.	0
ClaimBuster	4762				In the -- in the last women have lost 580,000 jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	4763				We will reform our military.	0
ClaimBuster	4764				Now, Joe, Senator Obama's plan, if you're a small business and you are able -- and your -- the guy that sells to you will not have his capital gains tax increase, which Senator Obama wants, if you're out there, my friend, and you've got employees, and you've got kids, if you don't get -- adopt the health care plan that Senator Obama mandates, he's going to fine you.	1
ClaimBuster	4765				The difference between where it is and 5.4 percent is 9 million Americans without work.	1
ClaimBuster	4766				So I'll get rid of that.	0
ClaimBuster	4767				As far as North Korea is concerned, our secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, went to North Korea.	1
ClaimBuster	4768				But any one that's here, we want to have more jobs here.	0
ClaimBuster	4769				But in any event, I understand the problems.	0
ClaimBuster	4770				And that is another way to help deal with the threats that we face in the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	4771				It means that the American buyer is getting a better bargain today because inflation is less.	1
ClaimBuster	4772				This is about American jobs and opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	4773				We will have secure borders, but we'll also have reform.	0
ClaimBuster	4774				I don't believe we ought to pay our bills through inflation, through a phony interest rate.	0
ClaimBuster	4775				For example, Germany will spend a trillion dollars building infrastructure over the next 10 years.	1
ClaimBuster	4776				And so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people.	1
ClaimBuster	4777				But the question is whether this other option proposed by the President should be pursued.	0
ClaimBuster	4778				Now, there's more work to do.	0
ClaimBuster	4779				That's been one of the hallmarks of my administration.	0
ClaimBuster	4780				I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and can't care for themselves are cared by -- by one another.	0
ClaimBuster	4781				And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth.	1
ClaimBuster	4782				Senator McCain's own campaign said publicly last week that, if we keep on talking about the economic crisis, we lose, so we need to change the subject.	1
ClaimBuster	4783				And when I'm president, we're going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond and we're going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in America for all corporations, 5 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	4784				Mine does not grow the government, it does not invest, have government invest.	0
ClaimBuster	4785				Let's give the money directly to students.	0
ClaimBuster	4786				What I'm saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws -- it's a great alternative to abortion -- continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs.	0
ClaimBuster	4787				Our funding for recovery is up, recovering the addicts.	1
ClaimBuster	4788				Let me tell you what I'm actually going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	4789				But the fact is that that's the situation that was left when I got there.	0
ClaimBuster	4790				But 2 former defense secretaries recently issued a report saying that 100,000 or slightly fewer troops would be enough, including President Reagan's former defense secretary, Mr. Carlucci.	1
ClaimBuster	4791				It's being used in 17 states right now.	1
ClaimBuster	4792				I also personally took responsibility tonight when Senator Dole asked me about the drug problem.	1
ClaimBuster	4793				I understand that both the - the uh - Department of State and the Defense Department have approved the accuracy of today's report, or yesterday's report, and also the National Security Agency.	1
ClaimBuster	4794				Now, maybe to some in this Bushnell Memorial that it's not a lot of money, but people watching tonight with a couple of kids, a working family, that's four or five months of day care, maybe a personal computer; it's may be three or four months of mortgage payments.	1
ClaimBuster	4795				And so one of the things that we've been doing is, is, for example, organizing entrepreneurship conferences with these Egyptians to give them a sense of how they can start rebuilding their economy in a way that's noncorrupt, that's transparent.	1
ClaimBuster	4796				And those are the stakes.	0
ClaimBuster	4797				For 30 years, you've been in a position to help, and if you say that I use steel or I use something else, I -- make it impossible for me to do that.	1
ClaimBuster	4798				They hired people -- they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.	1
ClaimBuster	4799				But I think what we want to avoid is falling back into this nationalized health care system that President Clinton wanted to give us in 1993.	1
ClaimBuster	4800				The American people asked me to get into it.	1
ClaimBuster	4801				And I ask for your support on November 8th.	0
ClaimBuster	4802				Your responsibility is to show up on November the 5th.	0
ClaimBuster	4803				Well, they sell us about this much stuff every year, and we sell them about this much stuff every year.	0
ClaimBuster	4804				If they did it by surprise...	0
ClaimBuster	4805				Found a boy -- excuse me, but this gives the flavor -- a boy in Houston kept a chicken in the bathtub in downtown Houston and missed 65 days going to livestock shows.	1
ClaimBuster	4806				In the Senate we passed the right of Americans to import drugs from Canada.	1
ClaimBuster	4807				Our priorities ought to be first of all to meet our own military needs, secondly to meet the needs of our allies and friends, and only then should we ship military equipment to foreign countries.	0
ClaimBuster	4808				My plan says that we want to raise marginal incomes on family incomes above $200,000 from 31 to 36 percent, that we want to ask foreign corporations simply to pay the same percentage of taxes on their income that American corporations play (sic) in America, that we want to use that money to provide over $100 billion in tax cuts for investment in new plant and equipment, for small business, for new technologies, and for middle class tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	4809				Uh - that would mean a cutback in the Soviet program; it would not interfere with our own program.	0
ClaimBuster	4810				I think it's the people's money.	0
ClaimBuster	4811				This is money out of that family's pocket.	0
ClaimBuster	4812				I - I'm strongly against a- abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	4813				I'm opposed to that, was opposed to it in October, 1958.	1
ClaimBuster	4814				It's put a lot of people out of business.	1
ClaimBuster	4815				By the way, I don't like to have the federal government start pushing its weight deeper and deeper into our schools.	0
ClaimBuster	4816				Senator Obama has never taken on his leaders of his party on a single issue.	1
ClaimBuster	4817				There√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s been opportunity to do so but this administration has failed to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	4818				"So let's have -- and let's have the American people say, ""Fix it for us."""	0
ClaimBuster	4819				China should go into North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	4820				When I took office, Haiti was governed by a dictator that had defied the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	4821				And all you hear about is how bad things are.	0
ClaimBuster	4822				They outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, who only a week earlier had been on the other side fighting against us, neither of whom trusted each other.	1
ClaimBuster	4823				And we have to change in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	4824				I see a man that took the leadership in the Job Training Partnership Act and that retrains people in this highly competitive changing society we're in, so if a person loses his hob he is retrained for a benefit-for a-work that will be productive and he won't have to go on one of these many programs that the liberal-talking about.	1
ClaimBuster	4825				In fact, the inspector general of the Justice Department found that John Ashcroft had twice applied it in ways that were inappropriate.	1
ClaimBuster	4826				As a nuclear engineer myself, I know the limitations and capabilities of atomic power.	0
ClaimBuster	4827				All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis.	0
ClaimBuster	4828				I'm going to close the loopholes that actually encourage companies to go overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	4829				There are forces there -- and that includes Syria, in my mind -- who don't want us to succeed, who don't want that kind of a peace with a dominant Lebanon, dominant over its own territory.	0
ClaimBuster	4830				And a free Iraq is going to make this world a more peaceful place.	0
ClaimBuster	4831				So when you look at the penalty that he paid, and when you analyze the requirements that I had - to spend all of my time working on the economy, which was in trouble, that I inherited; working on our problems in Southeast Asia - which were still plaguing us - it seemed to me that Mr. Nixon had been penalized enough by his resignation in disgrace and the need, and necessity for me to concentrate on the problems of the country fully justified the action that I took.	0
ClaimBuster	4832				I've admitted it when I make a mistake, but then I go on and help, try to solve the problems.	0
ClaimBuster	4833				But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	4834				I think that it's in better shape now than he generally does.	0
ClaimBuster	4835				I want to cut the size of the congressional staffs, but I think you're going to have too much influence there with people who were never elected, who have lots of expertise.	0
ClaimBuster	4836				And let's take the money that we've been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild America, roads, bridges schools.	0
ClaimBuster	4837				"So what's the message going to be: ""Please join us in Iraq."	0
ClaimBuster	4838				"He said, ""I don't know."	1
ClaimBuster	4839				Number 2, I think it would increase the influence of unelected staff members in the Congress who have too much influence already.	0
ClaimBuster	4840				But it's important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top.	0
ClaimBuster	4841				The other party gives them lip service.	0
ClaimBuster	4842				I believe in maintaining the strength of America's military.	0
ClaimBuster	4843				We're increasing defense reasonably -- not too much, but we are increasing defense some -- because we want to be prepared in case somebody here gets called up, Jason.	1
ClaimBuster	4844				But you know what we also need to do as Americans is never let the terrorists change the Constitution of the United States in a way that disadvantages our rights.	0
ClaimBuster	4845				We need to help people who are between jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	4846				Now, he talks about Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	4847				I care a lot about this.	0
ClaimBuster	4848				But I also promised that I'd fight every single day on behalf of the American people, the middle class, and all those who were striving to get into the middle class.	1
ClaimBuster	4849				The president always has the right, and always has had the right, for preemptive strike.	1
ClaimBuster	4850				Secondly, if you're a family of four making $50,000 in Massachusetts, you get a 50% tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	4851				I believe that the judges ought not to take the place of the legislative branch of government.	0
ClaimBuster	4852				It's going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.	0
ClaimBuster	4853				You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history.	1
ClaimBuster	4854				I will deal with them from day 1.	0
ClaimBuster	4855				He was the last communist party boss there and then he became a dictator that by some other label he was still essentially a communist dictator.	1
ClaimBuster	4856				But when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul.	1
ClaimBuster	4857				And you take a look at the people of Haiti.	0
ClaimBuster	4858				And the idea that my tax-cut proposal is inflationary: I would like to ask the President why is it inflationary to let the people keep more of their money and spend it the way that they like, and it isn't inflationary to let him take that money and spend it the way he wants?	0
ClaimBuster	4859				We're using the military more now in terms of interdiction.	1
ClaimBuster	4860				But if India does not succeed - with her four hundred and fifty million people, if she can't make freedom work - then people around the world are going to determine - particularly in the underdeveloped world - that the only way that they can develop their resources is through the Communist system.	0
ClaimBuster	4861				Respect the First Amendment, but I will do something to help you raise your kids without that garbage.	0
ClaimBuster	4862				I hear this talk about a blank check.	0
ClaimBuster	4863				And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq, because what our commanders have said is we don't have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	4864				Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we'll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is -- it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.	1
ClaimBuster	4865				Under my plan, if you make -- the top -- the wealthy people pay 62% of the taxes today.	1
ClaimBuster	4866				Now, those are the details as we have them.	0
ClaimBuster	4867				Oh, you didn't delete them?	0
ClaimBuster	4868				We can, with the participation of all Americans, work together and solve these problems together.	0
ClaimBuster	4869				Now, our real problem here is they both have plans that will not work.	0
ClaimBuster	4870				And it is unfortunate, it is a difficult area, no doubt about it.	0
ClaimBuster	4871				We became grandparents a year-and-a-half ago.	1
ClaimBuster	4872				And acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in World War II, we laid down the Marshall Plan, President Truman did.	1
ClaimBuster	4873				I know how to save billions.	0
ClaimBuster	4874				When you get 99.5 percent of the money, we don't know what happened to the other .5 percent, we're looking for it, somebody got it, but it all went to Democrats.	1
ClaimBuster	4875				The bankruptcies have gone up - uh in an extraordinary degree.	1
ClaimBuster	4876				I will do everything that I can to make sure that you have good jobs, with rising incomes, that your kids have good educations from preschool through college.	0
ClaimBuster	4877				The t- man who grows tomatoes - it costs less for those tomatoes than it does for the label on the can.	1
ClaimBuster	4878				Isn't providing housing for families of low and moderate income, isn't it making possible for young families, first time home buyers to own their own home some day something that's part of the American dream?	0
ClaimBuster	4879				Let's say, this isn't Democrat or Republican, and it isn't liberal or conservative.	0
ClaimBuster	4880				One important way of looking at this is to ask who are you going to fight for?	0
ClaimBuster	4881				So, we're trying to undo some of the things that your administration did.	0
ClaimBuster	4882				Well, I think they ought to look at us as a country that understands freedom where it doesn't matter who you are or how you're raised or where you're from, that you can succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	4883				Now I just want to make one last point because Senator McCain mentioned NAFTA and the issue of trade and that actually bears on this issue.	1
ClaimBuster	4884				This is a very important moment in the history of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	4885				We want people to be able to enjoy their lives and know they're going to have a bright and prosperous future, not be at war.	0
ClaimBuster	4886				But Senator Dole's plans are not good for the country.	0
ClaimBuster	4887				Uh - I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh - pay teachers' salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers' salaries - at least that's the way I read his remarks.	1
ClaimBuster	4888				As I say, I feel that we have a problem here to resolve.	0
ClaimBuster	4889				Thank you very, very much.	0
ClaimBuster	4890				It used to be the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	4891				I think it should stay in a lockbox, and I'll tell you this.	0
ClaimBuster	4892				So what I've said is, your first $250,000.00 worth of income, no change.	1
ClaimBuster	4893				And the way you get things done is bury yourselves in the room with one another, put together the best program, take it to the American people, use the electronic town hall, the kind of thing you're doing here tonight, build a consensus and then do it and then go on to the next one.	0
ClaimBuster	4894				I agree with the general statement Mr. Bush made.	0
ClaimBuster	4895				China is growing at 7 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	4896				I said I had no recollection whatsoever of talking with any of the White House legislative liaison people.	1
ClaimBuster	4897				To giving every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit and go out and get the health insurance you want rather than mandates and fines for small businesses, as Senator Obama's plan calls for.	1
ClaimBuster	4898				Our CHIPS program got a late start because our government meets only four months out of every two years, Mr. Vice President.	1
ClaimBuster	4899				It will probably have to be done by a commission.	0
ClaimBuster	4900				But I certainly would not impose any litmus test.	0
ClaimBuster	4901				And Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way.	0
ClaimBuster	4902				That's why we have the great migration.	0
ClaimBuster	4903				We now have 2500 hospices.	1
ClaimBuster	4904				That is all it says a simple guarantee of equality of opportunity which typifies the Democratic arty, and which is a very important commitment of mine, as contrasted with Governor Reagan's radical departure from the long-standing policy of his own party.	0
ClaimBuster	4905				There isn't any question but that we will defend Guantanamo if it's attacked.	0
ClaimBuster	4906				We need to have walk-in clinics.	0
ClaimBuster	4907				Someone called them something else.	0
ClaimBuster	4908				A lot of things happened which maybe shouldn't have happened.	0
ClaimBuster	4909				Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.	1
ClaimBuster	4910				If you don't want to take the offer of the plan that I want to put forward, you don't have do.	0
ClaimBuster	4911				And this is a safer country.	0
ClaimBuster	4912				So they don't have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000.	1
ClaimBuster	4913				But I will get back to the economic package because, again, I think this is very important.	0
ClaimBuster	4914				Because the 2% of the country that is involved in farming is important because the rest of us wouldn't eat except for them.	1
ClaimBuster	4915				And if we're asking for no revenue, then that means that we've got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff.	0
ClaimBuster	4916				My priority is going to be the health of our citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	4917				Mine for foreign affairs is democracy and freedom, and look at the dramatic changes around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	4918				You own this country but you have no voice in it the way it's organized now, and if you want to have a high risk experience, comparable to bungee jumping, go into Congress some time when they're working on this kind of legislation, when the lobbyists are running up and down the halls.	0
ClaimBuster	4919				In fact, this week we'll be carrying out the largest military exercise with Israel in history, this very week.	1
ClaimBuster	4920				We have huge difference between us on this question.	0
ClaimBuster	4921				The hardest decision a president makes is ever to use force.	0
ClaimBuster	4922				We had inflation of over 12 percent, we were on the brink of the worst recession in the last forty years, we were still deeply involved in the problems of Vietnam.	1
ClaimBuster	4923				Mr. Howe, Senator Kennedy, my fellow Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	4924				And then at that Democratic convention, they made a determination and they said there, ideology doesn't matter, just competence.	0
ClaimBuster	4925				But the reason for that is obvious.	0
ClaimBuster	4926				So there are some positive ways we can work on this.	0
ClaimBuster	4927				I repeat, within days after you made that pledge, you broke it; you said, well, maybe as a last resort we'll do it.	1
ClaimBuster	4928				It's a system that's got to be cleaned up.	0
ClaimBuster	4929				And today there's a memorial service for one of those that was lost in this tragedy.	1
ClaimBuster	4930				That's what we have here.	0
ClaimBuster	4931				I don't think that's the role of the president.	0
ClaimBuster	4932				I think the United States should have offered the opportunity to provide the nuclear fuel, test them, see whether or not they were actually looking for it for peaceful purposes.	0
ClaimBuster	4933				Now, if we're going to have another summit conference, there must be negotiations at the diplomatic level - the ambassadors, the Secretaries of State, and others at that level - prior to that time, which will delineate the issues and which will prepare the way for the heads of state to meet and make some progress.	0
ClaimBuster	4934				Now, keep in mind that our military spending has gone up every single year that I've been in office.	1
ClaimBuster	4935				It says that you can't gag a doctor, doctor can advise you.	0
ClaimBuster	4936				Governors like me and others have been trying to deal with the consequences.	0
ClaimBuster	4937				That means that we must continue to have a balanced budget here at home in every possible circumstance that we can; because the moment that we have loss of confidence in our own fiscal policies at home, it results in gold flowing out.	0
ClaimBuster	4938				But I will be a tolerant person.	0
ClaimBuster	4939				But we need much more than wind and solar.	0
ClaimBuster	4940				I'm sure every state in the union has got them.	1
ClaimBuster	4941				That -- that Detroit -- that Detroit answer...	0
ClaimBuster	4942				Compared to four years ago, we're clearly better off.	0
ClaimBuster	4943				And you know how you can trust me about that?	0
ClaimBuster	4944				We were able to drive our schools to be number one in the nation in my state.	1
ClaimBuster	4945				I was very interested to hear about Central America and our process down there, and I thought for a moment that instead of a debate I was going to find Mr. Mondale in complete agreement with what we're doing, because the plan that he has outlined is the one we've been following for quite some time, including diplomatic processes throughout Central America and working closely with the Contadora group.	1
ClaimBuster	4946				And, you know, there's always a reason for everything.	0
ClaimBuster	4947				But did I-did I sense a desire that maybe Lloyd Bentsen ought to be your running mate when you said there are three people on your ticket?	0
ClaimBuster	4948				There are only three left.	1
ClaimBuster	4949				Race remains a significant challenge in our country.	0
ClaimBuster	4950				And the -- the worst symptom on this disease is what my friend, Tom Coburn, calls earmarking as a gateway drug, because it's a gateway.	0
ClaimBuster	4951				He suggests that there are a number of other items in this whole depletion field that could be taken into account.	0
ClaimBuster	4952				It's not just that he has some of the best foreign policy credentials of anybody.	0
ClaimBuster	4953				Is there an equal time rule tonight?	0
ClaimBuster	4954				Ms. Golden, certainly the church has the right to take a position on moral issues.	0
ClaimBuster	4955				But the only uh - thing I uh - have pointed out was, what I've just said, and that there was a need to clarify the technicalities so that you couldn't be forced to release a person who was obviously guilty just because of a - of a small technicality in the law.	0
ClaimBuster	4956				It just takes good, strong leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	4957				That's kind of a pre-September 10th mentality, the hope that somehow resolutions and failed inspections would make this world a more peaceful place.	0
ClaimBuster	4958				And you hear all the bad stuff that's happened on my watch; I hope people will recognize that this is something pretty good for mankind.	0
ClaimBuster	4959				I agree with Mr. Bush that values are important.	0
ClaimBuster	4960				And that's going to be my job.	0
ClaimBuster	4961				Those are the kinds of priorities for national security and for foreign policy that I want to pursue Mr. Bush and I have major differences on these issues and I hope very much to be president and pursue them.	0
ClaimBuster	4962				Well, I think it's pretty liberal, I'll put that label on it.	0
ClaimBuster	4963				You tried it last time you ran.	1
ClaimBuster	4964				In this case when you murder somebody it's hate, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	4965				You have a raging debate about those plans.	0
ClaimBuster	4966				How strong are we going to be?	0
ClaimBuster	4967				We're also going to have our loan program, so that people are able to afford school.	0
ClaimBuster	4968				They don't like it when there's an unfair pounding and kind of hooting about people.	0
ClaimBuster	4969				The governor used the phrase phony numbers, but if you look at the plan and add the numbers up, these numbers are correct.	1
ClaimBuster	4970				But I would certainly not do first strike.	0
ClaimBuster	4971				And in 1985, he flew back from the West Coast to cut that COLA.	1
ClaimBuster	4972				There's a lot of pressures.	0
ClaimBuster	4973				Five hundred murders is a lot of murders.	0
ClaimBuster	4974				I'll lead you in an open and honest way, and I ask for your vote.	0
ClaimBuster	4975				Two-thirds of the country was a no-fly zone when we started this war.	1
ClaimBuster	4976				And I am also focussed on the fact that isn't it a paradox that we have the highest productivity in our workforce in the industrialized world and at the same time have the largest trade deficit, and at the same time rank behind 9 other nations in what we pay our most productive people in the world, and we're losing whole industries overseas.	1
ClaimBuster	4977				More countries in Asia voted against us on that question than voted with us.	1
ClaimBuster	4978				It's not going to be like the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	4979				Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks.	1
ClaimBuster	4980				Let me just say, Jim, you haven't heard the governor deny these numbers.	0
ClaimBuster	4981				I believe I know what this country ought to be.	0
ClaimBuster	4982				Let me begin by saying that my health-care plan is not what the president described.	0
ClaimBuster	4983				It's gone -- we have now presided over the largest increase in the size of government since the Great Society.	1
ClaimBuster	4984				I'm awfully glad you ge- got that question because as you know I got into it at the last of my other question and wasn't able to complete the argument.	0
ClaimBuster	4985				Governor Reagan is not responsible for what has happened over the last four years, nor am I.	0
ClaimBuster	4986				I've been a person that had been called a uniter, not a divider, because I accept other people's points of view.	0
ClaimBuster	4987				Would he have bombed Iran?	0
ClaimBuster	4988				One of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever.	1
ClaimBuster	4989				Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans' wages.	0
ClaimBuster	4990				But I would not want anyone to elect me uh - president of the United States - or vote for me - under the expectation that life would be easier if I were elected.	0
ClaimBuster	4991				Well, first of all, I admire Senator Kerry's service to our country.	0
ClaimBuster	4992				We cannot just say law and order.	0
ClaimBuster	4993				Why didn't she do something about it?	0
ClaimBuster	4994				He talks about the progress in the field of slum clearance and the like.	0
ClaimBuster	4995				So we can fight this war, and we can win this war.	0
ClaimBuster	4996				I think that there needs to be checks and balances in a democracy, and made that very clear that by consolidating power in the central government, he's sending a signal to the Western world and United States that perhaps he doesn't believe in checks and balances, and I told him that.	0
ClaimBuster	4997				You know, America's best days are ahead of us.	0
ClaimBuster	4998				But all I'm suggesting is let's not be na√É∆í√Ç¬Øve in dealing with the Soviets and make a lot of unilateral cuts hoping against hope that they will match our bid.	0
ClaimBuster	4999				President Clinton did the same thing, because we have an obligation to protect you.	0
ClaimBuster	5000				So I say this is very simple.	0
ClaimBuster	5001				That's what it's meant to do.	0
ClaimBuster	5002				Sam Raybum had a great expression on this.	0
ClaimBuster	5003				And that's my biggest concern about my opponent.	0
ClaimBuster	5004				for a specific cause or a specific objective, come with such red tape, such priorities established by a bureaucracy in Washington, that the local government's hands are tied with regard to using that money as they feel could best be used, and for what they think might be the top priority.	0
ClaimBuster	5005				I believe we must meet our commitment to uh - Formosa.	0
ClaimBuster	5006				Again, that means not running big deficits here and not squandering our surplus.	0
ClaimBuster	5007				The best way to keep jobs here in America is, one, have an energy plan.	0
ClaimBuster	5008				So that's how I feel about it, and I think if we had the right kind of campaign reform, we'd get the changes you want.	0
ClaimBuster	5009				Just today I met with the presidents and the vice presidents of the Willow Run union here, near here.	1
ClaimBuster	5010				You're going to lose some deductions, and you can't buy the sales pitch.	0
ClaimBuster	5011				I'm convinced we'll do it.	0
ClaimBuster	5012				I suggest you pick a person who's successfully managed money.	0
ClaimBuster	5013				It's going to help those families, and it's going to create incentives to start growing jobs again in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	5014				Laos is moving in that direction.	1
ClaimBuster	5015				And these are the things you have to think through.	0
ClaimBuster	5016				We have increased oil production to the highest levels in 16 years.	1
ClaimBuster	5017				Those would all, could all be challenged by men.	0
ClaimBuster	5018				The President talks of Government programs, and they have their place.	0
ClaimBuster	5019				Well obviously my views are a little different.	0
ClaimBuster	5020				Now, on this issue of aiding Pakistan, if you're going to aim a gun at somebody, George Shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, you'd better be prepared to pull the trigger.	1
ClaimBuster	5021				And I grew up learning how to respect those views.	0
ClaimBuster	5022				I've had more people talk to me about their health care problems I guess than anything else, all across America -- you know, people who've lost their jobs, lost their businesses, had to give up their jobs because of sick children.	1
ClaimBuster	5023				And we want to encourage that.	0
ClaimBuster	5024				We have to turn around -- most schools are excellent, but we have to make sure that all of them are.	0
ClaimBuster	5025				And I don't hold it against him that he said grave threat.	0
ClaimBuster	5026				But I feel very strongly about that.	0
ClaimBuster	5027				And I believe I can.	0
ClaimBuster	5028				I want to double the dividend from $3,500 to $7,000 for every dependent child in America.	0
ClaimBuster	5029				I'm not going to cut her benefits or support any proposal that would.	0
ClaimBuster	5030				So there are differences but that's about the main area where I think we have a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	5031				But if our government itself is doing business with people who we know are engaged in drug profiteering and drug trafficking, if we don't understand that that sends out a very, very bad message to our young people, it's a little difficult for me to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that I talked about and to young people like her all over the country, and say to them we want to help you.	0
ClaimBuster	5032				And I want the states to meet their responsibilities.	0
ClaimBuster	5033				like a driver's license for new handguns and, you know, the Los Angeles --	0
ClaimBuster	5034				Could we do another round on it?	0
ClaimBuster	5035				I was joking with an old veteran friend, who joked with me, about Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	5036				So let's look at our record.	0
ClaimBuster	5037				He says, well, he's going to raise the taxes on the rich -- that's what he said -- the top two brackets.	1
ClaimBuster	5038				If you make bad investments, that's too bad.	0
ClaimBuster	5039				I talked to one of the leading former chiefs of Naval operations in my office a few weeks ago, who told me about 25,000 Chief Petty Officers being short.	1
ClaimBuster	5040				Doctors don't dare to deliver babies sometimes because they're afraid that somebody's going to sue them.	0
ClaimBuster	5041				One could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way.	0
ClaimBuster	5042				There's one for the people who have, and there's one for the people who don't have.	0
ClaimBuster	5043				I think this is the right strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	5044				But I will say as a Democrat, I was a real piker, Mr. President.	1
ClaimBuster	5045				A group of Arab scholars came together, organized by the U.N., to look at how we can help the -- the world reject these -- these terrorists.	1
ClaimBuster	5046				And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena.	1
ClaimBuster	5047				This is what the families of MIAs want.	0
ClaimBuster	5048				So we passed the Kassebaum-Kennedy, the Kennedy Kassebaum bill that will cover about 20 to 25 million people.	1
ClaimBuster	5049				It was turned over to the agency head of the CIA in Nicaragua to be printed.	1
ClaimBuster	5050				Under my tax plan that he continues to criticize, I set one-third.	1
ClaimBuster	5051				Under my plan it will be -- its solvency will be extended until you're 100.	0
ClaimBuster	5052				But the important thing is, if we suffer defeat in Iraq, which General Petraeus predicts we will, if we adopted Senator Obama's set date for withdrawal, then that will have a calamitous effect in Afghanistan and American national security interests in the region.	1
ClaimBuster	5053				And, finally, who would you give your pension fund and your savings account to manage?	0
ClaimBuster	5054				And the policy in Central America, regrettably, has failed because the Congress has been unwilling to support those who have been fighting for freedom.	1
ClaimBuster	5055				You've got to have the best intelligence in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	5056				So it seems to me instead of the anti-Washington feeling being aimed at everybody in Washington, it seems to me that the focus should be where the problem is, which is the Congress of the United States, and particularly the majority in the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	5057				I think we need to be more even-handed, as evidently 99 senators -- I think it was 99 senators supported that position.	1
ClaimBuster	5058				Our health program - the one that Senator Javits and other Republican Senators, as well as I supported - is one that provides for all people over sixty-five who want health insurance, the opportunity to have it if they want it.	1
ClaimBuster	5059				Democratic woman up there -- taking the lead in this.	0
ClaimBuster	5060				There is no way that the recovery is even across the country, just as in the depths of the recession, there were some parts of the country that were worse off, but some that didn't even feel the pain of the recession.	0
ClaimBuster	5061				That is the way it will stay.	0
ClaimBuster	5062				Let me just point out first of all this board that we're talking about can't make decisions about what treatments are given.	1
ClaimBuster	5063				Let me just tell you who the jury is.	0
ClaimBuster	5064				I've shown the American people I know how to lead.	0
ClaimBuster	5065				But I don't think we know the solution to global warming yet.	0
ClaimBuster	5066				Members of the clergy who have done the same.	0
ClaimBuster	5067				What I believe is we have to do, as the president mentioned towards the end of his remarks there, which is to make enormous efforts to enforce the gun laws that we have, and to change the culture of violence that we have.	0
ClaimBuster	5068				"You said, ""Look, I'm going to extend the tax policies that we have now; I'm not going to raise taxes on anyone, because when the economy is growing slow like this, when we're in recession, you shouldn't raise taxes on anyone."""	1
ClaimBuster	5069				I'm not discussing Whitewater now.	0
ClaimBuster	5070				Keep in mind that I and Americans took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able to, without putting troops on the ground at the cost of less than what we spent in two weeks in Iraq, liberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years.	1
ClaimBuster	5071				Right now, I meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college or if they're going to college, they are taking on $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $60,000 worth of debt, and it's very difficult for them to go into some fields, like basic research in science, for example, thinking to themselves that they're going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house.	1
ClaimBuster	5072				What things would I cut from spending?	0
ClaimBuster	5073				And yet the cash register's empty and it used to have our money, the taxpayers' money, in it, and we didn't get the results.	0
ClaimBuster	5074				I know a lot about that.	1
ClaimBuster	5075				Nikki, that's a question that's been raised by a lot of people around the country.	1
ClaimBuster	5076				And all of us are in this fight together, all of us care.	0
ClaimBuster	5077				One of the criteria that I think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved, if we can really make the difference with military forces.	0
ClaimBuster	5078				Now that's estimated to create 800,000 jobs, the problem is they won't be here, they'll be in places like China.	1
ClaimBuster	5079				I respect the sincerity which he m- which he makes that suggestion.	0
ClaimBuster	5080				But we'd like to have a Social Security fund that has about 70 years of life instead of about 30 years of life.	0
ClaimBuster	5081				Let me go back to the main point, Sandy.	0
ClaimBuster	5082				It has been blocked by a Senate in which there is a Democratic majority.	1
ClaimBuster	5083				So what is at test here is the credibility of the United States of America and how we lead the world.	0
ClaimBuster	5084				We're well ahead and we can stay ahead, provided we have confidence in America and don't run her down in order to build her up.	0
ClaimBuster	5085				He had two terms in the Senate, serving his second term.	1
ClaimBuster	5086				The entire press corps has looked at it.	1
ClaimBuster	5087				I will look at it at the time.	0
ClaimBuster	5088				There's a great young group, Lead or Leave, college students, young people, who don't want us to spend their money.	1
ClaimBuster	5089				And to do the job, you can't cut the money for it.	0
ClaimBuster	5090				That is absolutely not true.	0
ClaimBuster	5091				But what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision.	0
ClaimBuster	5092				He went to one meeting, and then we heard that he was stepping down.	1
ClaimBuster	5093				But Jesse Jackson is an independent person.	0
ClaimBuster	5094				We heard the same thing.	0
ClaimBuster	5095				I think people understand what she's saying.	0
ClaimBuster	5096				We ought to deal with each of these countries separately.	0
ClaimBuster	5097				I won't support judges like that.	0
ClaimBuster	5098				But I am uh - very glad to point out that since 1969, during a Republican administrations, we have had ten million people taken off of the tax rolls at the lower end of the taxpayer area.	1
ClaimBuster	5099				And I believe that we can bind our wounds.	0
ClaimBuster	5100				We did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems.	0
ClaimBuster	5101				You say that you're not interested in duplicating what happened in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	5102				But we're lawyers, I like lawyers.	1
ClaimBuster	5103				Costs will continue to spiral.	0
ClaimBuster	5104				The feelings are very strong.	0
ClaimBuster	5105				And eleven of 'em have been overridden.	1
ClaimBuster	5106				We can create millions of jobs in these new technologies- -more than we're going to lose in defense -- if we target it.	0
ClaimBuster	5107				And I know how to work with them.	0
ClaimBuster	5108				Now, I want to build the wall.	0
ClaimBuster	5109				But I'd like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I'm -- not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries.	1
ClaimBuster	5110				There are now over 2,000 more warheads pointed at us today than there were when he was sworn in, and that does not strengthen us.	1
ClaimBuster	5111				I know that Mr. Mondale, in the past, has made statements as if they were just people like ourselves, and if we were kind and good and did something nice, they would respond accordingly.	1
ClaimBuster	5112				About uh - late October of 1975, I asked the then Secretary of Defense, Mr. Schlesinger, to tell me what had to be done if we were going to reduce the defense budget by uh - three to five billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	5113				It also means we're helping them and small businesses to export all around the world to new markets.	1
ClaimBuster	5114				And the good thing about this is they'll be able to go across America.	0
ClaimBuster	5115				Well, it's pretty simple when they say: Are you for a ban on partial birth abortion?	0
ClaimBuster	5116				I will say this about Hillary.	0
ClaimBuster	5117				And therefore I've never suggested we should uh - be able to retire the debt substantially, or even at all in nineteen sixty-one or two.	1
ClaimBuster	5118				I will say this: that we will set as our goal a steady, gradual reduction of the deficit, which will require tough choices on spending; it will require a good strong rate of economic growth; it will require a plan that the president works out with the Congress doesn't blame them, works it out with them, which brings that deficit down; it will require us to go out and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren't being paid in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	5119				For a belief that law must be based on a higher law.	0
ClaimBuster	5120				And in this case I'm glad we did, because if we had let sanctions work and tried to build a consensus on that, Saddam Hussein today would be in Saudi Arabia controlling the world's oil supply, and he would be there maybe with a nuclear weapon.	0
ClaimBuster	5121				There's been too much finger pointing and too much name calling in Washington, D.C.	0
ClaimBuster	5122				You have a lot of it.	0
ClaimBuster	5123				And, last one, who would you ask to be the trustee of your estate and take care of your children if something happened to you?	0
ClaimBuster	5124				And, John, I -- you're absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say.	0
ClaimBuster	5125				I'd have confidence in him.	0
ClaimBuster	5126				I'm not aware of any program -- well, I'll just leave it at that.	0
ClaimBuster	5127				I don't think they'll look at us with envy.	0
ClaimBuster	5128				That's why I've focused on putting resources into solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal.	1
ClaimBuster	5129				You got a lot of women running for office.	0
ClaimBuster	5130				And we're struggling with that today.	0
ClaimBuster	5131				We cannot continue to afford -- she took that as saying nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	5132				Bear in mind that we have a lot of sanctions in force against Serbia right now.	1
ClaimBuster	5133				If you all want the enterprise zones, why don't we pass the dang thing and do it, right?	0
ClaimBuster	5134				And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	5135				Raise your hand if you're in managed care plan.	0
ClaimBuster	5136				All I'm going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it.	0
ClaimBuster	5137				But we had been digging our way out of policies that were misplaced and focused on the top doing very well and middle class folks not doing well.	1
ClaimBuster	5138				What's the net result of this?	0
ClaimBuster	5139				At the other extreme, uh - just 1 percent of the richest people in our country derive 25 percent of all the tax benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	5140				And I hope that will happen.	0
ClaimBuster	5141				But I believe that the next Administration should work for a balanced budget, and that would be my intention.	0
ClaimBuster	5142				If we don't have the best education system in the world, if we don't continue to put money into research and technology that will allow us to create great businesses here in the United States, that's how we lose the competition.	1
ClaimBuster	5143				When it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now.	0
ClaimBuster	5144				I immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable.	1
ClaimBuster	5145				There may be some moments when we use our troops as peacekeepers, but not often.	1
ClaimBuster	5146				And the reason that it's a problem to go shopping state by state, you know what insurance companies will do?	0
ClaimBuster	5147				And we kicked this man out of Kuwait.	1
ClaimBuster	5148				I don't want the American people to be confused.	0
ClaimBuster	5149				It was principled, and it was strategic.	0
ClaimBuster	5150				We're down 35,000 jobs in the private sector.	1
ClaimBuster	5151				And one of the consequences to allow parents to have different choices.	0
ClaimBuster	5152				Now, Senator McCain, the centerpiece of his economic proposal is to provide $200 billion in additional tax breaks to some of the wealthiest corporations in America.	1
ClaimBuster	5153				You've got stop-loss policies, so people can't get out when they were supposed to.	0
ClaimBuster	5154				Couple of service men here.	1
ClaimBuster	5155				Now the present Administration - the President - has said - never indicated what he thought of the 1954 decision.	1
ClaimBuster	5156				But what I would do first and foremost, is I would get in touch with the Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, to find out all the facts and all the circumstances.	0
ClaimBuster	5157				This goes on night and day.	0
ClaimBuster	5158				And I voted the same way that he did three months before in a national governors' conference.	1
ClaimBuster	5159				And I may have to make those tough decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	5160				But the best way to protect our citizens from guns is to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns.	0
ClaimBuster	5161				I guess the Vice President two or three times, said I was coming from the left.	1
ClaimBuster	5162				We have fought to try to raise the minimum wage in the last years.	1
ClaimBuster	5163				It's a great thing for the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	5164				The Congress is doing a better job of it.	0
ClaimBuster	5165				There is no question but that we cannot discuss our internal affairs in the United States without recognizing that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position.	0
ClaimBuster	5166				Because I believe it saves lives, Leo, I do.	0
ClaimBuster	5167				And that's what we've done.	0
ClaimBuster	5168				It's coming back now, so they can buy even more American products, and I think it will go down more.	0
ClaimBuster	5169				They would also know that we lived in a world with terrible weapons, nuclear weapons of terrible destructive power, aimed at each other, capable of crossing the ocean in a matter of minutes and destroying civilization as we knew it.	0
ClaimBuster	5170				It is a school full of so-called at-risk children.	1
ClaimBuster	5171				This kind of confusion and absence of leadership has let us drift now for two years with a constantly increasing threat of atomic weapons throughout the world.	0
ClaimBuster	5172				And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	5173				Well, I guess some may be better off.	0
ClaimBuster	5174				They will not let them see the written instructions given to Ambassador Glaspie.	0
ClaimBuster	5175				So, on the key issues that are of importance to American families, Joe Biden's always been on the right side, and I think he will make an outstanding president if, heaven forbid, something happened to me.	0
ClaimBuster	5176				But it is very important.	0
ClaimBuster	5177				"And he is also running on a platform that suggests a litmus test for the selection of judges - that only judges that hold a certain, quote, ""view,"" on the sanctity of family life, ought to be appointed to the Federal Judiciary, one of the three great independent branches of our Government."	1
ClaimBuster	5178				It's been growing about 12 percent per year over a long period of time.	1
ClaimBuster	5179				We may think that you deal with them in different ways.	0
ClaimBuster	5180				And then the Government of Lebanon asked us back in as a stabilizing force while they established a government and sought to get the foreign forces all the way out of Lebanon and that they could then take care of their own borders.	1
ClaimBuster	5181				Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.	1
ClaimBuster	5182				The neighborhood, the kind of environment people are growing up in, and that leads me to the programs I'm talking about in terms of education.	0
ClaimBuster	5183				I'm going to be able to balance the budget.	0
ClaimBuster	5184				So, I think we ought to do it in the Medicaid system.	0
ClaimBuster	5185				In giving our people better mental health care, we increased the number of employees.	1
ClaimBuster	5186				I'm going to do it in four years, and I'm going to immediately set out to have bilateral talks with North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	5187				When these Presidential Debates were held just four years ago, I remember the incumbent President, who was willing to debate, President Ford, telling the American people that they simply ought not to vote for somebody who promised more than they could deliver.	1
ClaimBuster	5188				We have a duty to protect our children and grandchildren.	0
ClaimBuster	5189				So if you've got $5,000 and it's going to cost you $12,000, that's a loss for you.	1
ClaimBuster	5190				And that means, yes, we still continue to open up new areas for drilling.	0
ClaimBuster	5191				And let's create jobs and let's get our economy going again.	0
ClaimBuster	5192				Health insurance premiums, up $2,500.	1
ClaimBuster	5193				You must have mandatory testing.	0
ClaimBuster	5194				All seniors are covered under prescription drugs in my plan.	1
ClaimBuster	5195				We all have tempers; I have one; I'm sure Senator Kennedy has one.	0
ClaimBuster	5196				There is a man here tonight named George McKinney from Milwaukee.	1
ClaimBuster	5197				I believe the people of this country can, and together, we can begin the world over again.	0
ClaimBuster	5198				Enforcement of law, and the federal government can help.	0
ClaimBuster	5199				The all- volunteer army works.	0
ClaimBuster	5200				It's either unfair for some or unfair for all.	0
ClaimBuster	5201				When the president had an opportunity to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, he took his focus off of them, outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, and Osama bin Laden escaped.	1
ClaimBuster	5202				The secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating.	1
ClaimBuster	5203				For instance, in the Transportation Department uh we had uh - we cut back about 25 percent of the total number of employees.	1
ClaimBuster	5204				Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit, and one of the things I'm sure we'll be discussing tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code?	0
ClaimBuster	5205				But part of it is also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these communities and making sure we catch violent impulses before they occur.	0
ClaimBuster	5206				There was one good thing that came out of that budget agreement, and that is we put a cap on discretionary spending.	1
ClaimBuster	5207				We've had enough of that, ladies and gentlemen.	0
ClaimBuster	5208				But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.	0
ClaimBuster	5209				And today, without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission, we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems.	1
ClaimBuster	5210				It's being fought primarily in Asia, in Africa, and in Latin America.	1
ClaimBuster	5211				But I believe -- we want to make sure that we have the relationships of friendship with the people that take his place, steps that in the years to come we see Syria as a -- as a friend, and Syria as a responsible party in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	5212				But I don't believe in these changing and revolutionary times this Administration has known that the world is changing - has identified itself with that change.	0
ClaimBuster	5213				So I think he's a bit taller than I am.	0
ClaimBuster	5214				I'm much more optimistic about this country than some.	0
ClaimBuster	5215				"We said, ""All right, if that's what you want to do.''"	0
ClaimBuster	5216				I don't want the government financing congressional elections.	0
ClaimBuster	5217				I've stood up and told the American people that I think it's a real problem, that it can destroy long-term economic growth, and I've told you what I think should be done.	0
ClaimBuster	5218				The economy is slowing down, so it's hard to anticipate right now what the budget is going to look like next year.	1
ClaimBuster	5219				No wonder you've been fighting -- no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.	1
ClaimBuster	5220				President Clinton opposes term limits, President Clinton opposes a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	5221				I think bipartisanship is a national asset.	0
ClaimBuster	5222				We could have gained if they did it by surprise.	0
ClaimBuster	5223				But we have got to reform government.	0
ClaimBuster	5224				And we spent some time, and we said a prayer and, remarkably, about two months later, this young man and his mom showed up, and he looked unbelievable, good as new.	1
ClaimBuster	5225				We've run up more debt in the last eight years than under all the presidents from George Washington to Jimmy Carter combined.	1
ClaimBuster	5226				It sounds like the vice president√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s not right very many times tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	5227				He says on the one hand I am for it and on the other hand I may be against it.	1
ClaimBuster	5228				I've got a little ways to go before I start doing that.	0
ClaimBuster	5229				"And there was a huge poster of Vladimir Putin, and it said, ""Vladimir Putin, our president."""	1
ClaimBuster	5230				You have to gut it out, issue by issue by issue.	0
ClaimBuster	5231				But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform.	0
ClaimBuster	5232				And I'll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal.	1
ClaimBuster	5233				So I would send two to three additional brigades to Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	5234				These appointments are for life.	0
ClaimBuster	5235				You know my opinion on North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	5236				In the White House staff itself, when I became president, we had roughly five hundred and forty employees.	1
ClaimBuster	5237				The president wants to do well.	0
ClaimBuster	5238				We know better how to do it in California or Texas or wherever it is.	0
ClaimBuster	5239				I believe in strict constructionists.	0
ClaimBuster	5240				And you said we should ask Pakistan for permission.	0
ClaimBuster	5241				We need to make sure our seniors get the promise made.	0
ClaimBuster	5242				You all know me, and we've held it back a little.	0
ClaimBuster	5243				Number two, if you don't have health insurance, we're essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if you're out there trying to get insurance on the individual market.	1
ClaimBuster	5244				Because if we do not and SALT I expires on October three, 1977, you will unleash again an all-out nuclear arms race with the potential of a nuclear holocaust of unbelievable dimensions.	1
ClaimBuster	5245				We sort of seem to have a desire to try to stay over there and control it.	0
ClaimBuster	5246				The armed forces, the conventional forces of the United States have never been more ready.	0
ClaimBuster	5247				I think what is misleading is to say you can lead and succeed in Iraq if you keep changing your positions on this war.	0
ClaimBuster	5248				"And they looked me in the eye and said, ""Yes, sir, Mr."	1
ClaimBuster	5249				The auto emissions - uh - it was agreed by Leonard Woodcock, the head of the UAW, and by the uh - heads of all of the automobile industry, we had labor and management together saying that those auto emission standards had to be modified.	1
ClaimBuster	5250				But I have lived the American dream.	0
ClaimBuster	5251				And, by the way, this was a proposal made by Senator Clinton not too long ago.	1
ClaimBuster	5252				That's exactly what our budget does, and it also then allows us to reduce our deficit, which is a significant national security concern.	1
ClaimBuster	5253				It's the only reason to be for it.	0
ClaimBuster	5254				You're cutting back on maintenance and equipment.	0
ClaimBuster	5255				Their budget cut enforcement for the Environmental Protection Agency by a third.	1
ClaimBuster	5256				That meant immediately 46% of your people that were signing up had no reason for signing up.	1
ClaimBuster	5257				So we can make changes in the way our culture works to help bring people away from violence and give them opportunity, and bring them in the American system.	0
ClaimBuster	5258				The question before us is: which point of view and which party do we want to lead the United States?	0
ClaimBuster	5259				And there were a series of recommendations, as I recall, more than 40.	1
ClaimBuster	5260				Now, four years ago, when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families.	1
ClaimBuster	5261				Sometimes we - we get the opinion that in getting programs through the House or the Senate it's purely a question of legislative finagling and all that sort of thing.	0
ClaimBuster	5262				The wealthiest Americans have been taxed much less, even though their incomes have gone up.	1
ClaimBuster	5263				Mr. Edwards, I don't think it's a wise idea for presidential candidates to appoint the members of his cabinet prospectively, or to suggest four people - indicate that one of them surely will be appointed.	0
ClaimBuster	5264				Of course that's a charge that's always made against any governor who runs for the presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	5265				There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once.	1
ClaimBuster	5266				Now we can talk about Putin.	0
ClaimBuster	5267				We have devoted ourselves to our children and now our nearly one-and-a-half-year-old grandson.	1
ClaimBuster	5268				Devastated states like California and others.	0
ClaimBuster	5269				But as governor, when I was at that end of the line and receiving some of these grants for Government programs, I saw that so many of them were dead-end.	0
ClaimBuster	5270				I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home.	0
ClaimBuster	5271				And the fact that you're going to college is great, but I want everybody to get a great education and we've worked hard to make sure that student loans are available for folks like you, but I also want to make sure that community colleges are offering slots for workers to get retrained for the jobs that are out there right now and the jobs of the future.	1
ClaimBuster	5272				That was the right place.	0
ClaimBuster	5273				When the Republican platform says that from here on out, we're going to have a religious test for judges before they're selected for the Federal court, and then Jerry Falwell announces that that means they get at least two Justices of the Supreme Court, I think that's an abuse of faith in our country.	1
ClaimBuster	5274				I think we've seen a deterioration of values.	0
ClaimBuster	5275				And it's actually an accounting treatment, as you know, that's been in place for a hundred years.	1
ClaimBuster	5276				And if you do the math, those people who have employer-based health benefits, if you put the tax on it and you have what's left over and you add $5,000 that you're going to get as a refundable tax credit, do the math, 95 percent of the American people will have increased funds to go out and buy the insurance of their choice and to shop around and to get -- all of those people will be covered except for those who have these gold-plated Cadillac kinds of policies.	1
ClaimBuster	5277				And you can't say, because Saddam might have done it 10 years from now, that's a reason; that's an excuse.	0
ClaimBuster	5278				We've got two and a half million more Americans out of work now than we had when Mr. Ford took office.	1
ClaimBuster	5279				With all due respect to President Ford, I think he ought to be ashamed of mentioning that statement, because we have the highest unemployment rate now than we had at any time between the Great Depression caused by Herbert Hoover and the time President Ford took office.	1
ClaimBuster	5280				When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.	0
ClaimBuster	5281				Governor Clinton says $200,000 but he also says he wants to raise $150 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	5282				The first thing you did when you came into office was set up the stimulus package, said we've got a little pork we want to scatter around America, $16 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	5283				Pam, what the president didn't tell you is all his tax cuts expire the year 2000, but these increases go on forever.	1
ClaimBuster	5284				And they can look at my track record, whether it's Iran sanctions, whether it's dealing with counterterrorism, whether it's supporting democracy, whether it's supporting women's rights, whether it's supporting religious minorities.	0
ClaimBuster	5285				These are folks who've worked hard, like my grandmother, and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this.	0
ClaimBuster	5286				I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not -- who work full-time should not still be in poverty.	0
ClaimBuster	5287				We cannot send our people all over the world to solve every problem that comes up.	0
ClaimBuster	5288				We can know who the people are, that they're really the people they say they are when they cross the border.	0
ClaimBuster	5289				Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who's gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary.	1
ClaimBuster	5290				I believe that if we ask those questions that bear on our future, not just congratulate ourselves but challenge us to solve those problems, you'll see that we need new leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	5291				The matter of Somoza -- no, I never defended Somoza.	1
ClaimBuster	5292				The governor mentioned it earlier.	1
ClaimBuster	5293				And it's also unfair to dump these tremendous bills on our children.	0
ClaimBuster	5294				You were trying to defend your cut which was not a cut either, Reduction in the growth of spending.	0
ClaimBuster	5295				Listen, for 24 years I have never been afraid to take on the big drug companies.	1
ClaimBuster	5296				Some schools aren't even safe.	1
ClaimBuster	5297				Again, we've got plans lying all over the place in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	5298				Let me make my position cl ear.	0
ClaimBuster	5299				My grandmother died three days before I was elected president.	1
ClaimBuster	5300				I have a tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	5301				Well, Bob, you asked me a direct question.	1
ClaimBuster	5302				Maybe we will talk about some more before it's over.	0
ClaimBuster	5303				But we are there, and I think this insurance policy is necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	5304				I have no businesses there.	1
ClaimBuster	5305				In other words, in order to make sure we're secure, there must be a comprehensive plan.	0
ClaimBuster	5306				Well, they should look at our proposals and look at us as people and make up their own minds.	0
ClaimBuster	5307				But, of course, if you're a small business or a mom-and-pop business or a big business starting up here, you've got to pay even the reduced rate that Governor Romney's talking about.	1
ClaimBuster	5308				And they showed solidarity with them, but, also, they are very concerned about the Russian threats to regain their status of the old Russian to regain their status of the old Russian empire.	0
ClaimBuster	5309				I don't think we should have that kind of a program.	0
ClaimBuster	5310				And I look very, very much forward to doing it.	0
ClaimBuster	5311				You've got to go to the people.	0
ClaimBuster	5312				This is facts -- that would have given investment tax credits and other incentives to reinvest in our cities, in our country.	0
ClaimBuster	5313				I first want to say the President didn't quite give you all of the stuff on the quotas, because the Justice Department had what we called the Piscataway case up in New Jersey.	1
ClaimBuster	5314				And those two principles can now be applied to conventional forces, to strategic forces, provided	0
ClaimBuster	5315				I would like to have one in this race, come to think of it, but I don't get one.	0
ClaimBuster	5316				I think it's uh - also appropriate to point out that through our tax policies we have stimulated uhh - added employment throughout the country, the investment tax credit, the tax incentives for expansion and modernization of our industrial capacity.	0
ClaimBuster	5317				Somebody who sits in Washington, D.C., eighteen months after the Mayaguez incident, can be a very good grandstand quarterback.	0
ClaimBuster	5318				And I think it's so important -- one of the most important things we can do.	0
ClaimBuster	5319				Should they pay more for Social Security if they get more out of it than they paid in, they're upper income people?	0
ClaimBuster	5320				Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he's supporting for president.	0
ClaimBuster	5321				And Senator Obama, who after promising not to vote to cut off funds for the troops, did the incredible thing of voting to cut off the funds for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	5322				Why do we have to do it?	0
ClaimBuster	5323				I believe if we find poor children trapped in schools that won't teach, we need to free the parents.	0
ClaimBuster	5324				I don't believe we need a good judge of that kind of definition on either side.	0
ClaimBuster	5325				But I just know how this world works, and that in the councils of government, there must be certainty from the U.S. president.	0
ClaimBuster	5326				It can only be done in two ways: one, to conserve energy - to stop the waste of energy - and, secondly, to produce more American energy.	0
ClaimBuster	5327				I don't know, I'm not questioning anybody.	0
ClaimBuster	5328				And so I think that we're on the right track.	0
ClaimBuster	5329				Secondly, we need a guest-worker program, but if it's all we have, it's not going to solve the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	5330				And yes, we've got too many taxes on the American people and we're spending too much.	1
ClaimBuster	5331				But one thing I would say where diplomacy is concerned, Israel should feel absolutely secure about one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	5332				It doubles about every -- every five or so years.	1
ClaimBuster	5333				I'm not satisfied with it even if there were no Communism in the world, but particularly when we're in the kind of a race we're in, we have got to see that America grows just as fast as we can, provided we grow soundly.	0
ClaimBuster	5334				And Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that's OK, we can't force it into their country.	1
ClaimBuster	5335				So if we are going to be serious about this issue, we've got to have a president who is going to tackle it head-on.	0
ClaimBuster	5336				Now, what can I bring to that challenge?	0
ClaimBuster	5337				These are American citizens, we care deeply about them.	0
ClaimBuster	5338				We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored.	0
ClaimBuster	5339				I favor it not because I want to make a lot of oil men rich, but because I want to make America rich.	0
ClaimBuster	5340				When I made my decision to stop all trade with Iran as a result of the taking of our hostages, I announced then, and have consistently maintained since then, that if the hostages are released safely, we would make delivery on those items which Iran owns - which they have bought and paid for - also, that the frozen Iranian assets would be released.	1
ClaimBuster	5341				He's been traveling in some other country.	1
ClaimBuster	5342				What I said was the same thing that the audience here today heard me say, which is, if Pakistan is unable or unwilling to hunt down bin Laden and take him out, then we should.	1
ClaimBuster	5343				I will knock the hell out of ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	5344				Thirdly, on medical care for the aged, this is the same fight that's been going on for twenty-five years in Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	5345				Because under the last four years, they've been buried.	1
ClaimBuster	5346				It's not dirty campaigning because he's been talking about my record for a half a year here, 11 months here.	1
ClaimBuster	5347				I believe it my responsibility as the leader of the Democratic party in 1960 to try to warn the American people that in this crucial time we can no longer afford to stand still.	0
ClaimBuster	5348				No, I don't think there is.	0
ClaimBuster	5349				I believe that Ronald Reagan, John Kennedy, and the others did that more effectively, and I'm going to try to follow in their footsteps.	0
ClaimBuster	5350				His political opposition is being put in jail.	1
ClaimBuster	5351				These are places where people can get primary care.	1
ClaimBuster	5352				But I've got a better idea.	0
ClaimBuster	5353				And so the person you talked to, I say, here's some help, here's some trade adjustment assistance money for you to go a community college in your neighborhood, a community college which is providing the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	5354				But we also have to take demand seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	5355				And by working and coordinating our efforts together, not threatening to attack them, but working with them, and where necessary use force, but talk softly, but carry a big stick.	0
ClaimBuster	5356				And Governor Romney's says he's got a five-point plan?	0
ClaimBuster	5357				And there is no system.	0
ClaimBuster	5358				The recession that resulted this time was the briefest since the Second World War.	1
ClaimBuster	5359				We have to work more closely with our allies.	0
ClaimBuster	5360				Joe has always made sure that he is fighting on behalf of working families, and I think he shares my core values and my sense of where the country needs to go.	0
ClaimBuster	5361				Free trade with Colombia is something that's a no-brainer.	0
ClaimBuster	5362				And I was proud of that.	0
ClaimBuster	5363				I've reached the conclusion, too, based on the reports that have been made, that they may be cheating.	0
ClaimBuster	5364				We need to invest and grow, and that's what I want to do.	0
ClaimBuster	5365				They sell a lot of automobiles here, create a lot of jobs -- those who sell exports.	1
ClaimBuster	5366				And I said, well, I'll tell you.	0
ClaimBuster	5367				I think the American people are ready for action.	0
ClaimBuster	5368				I think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education -- on excellence in education.	1
ClaimBuster	5369				One way or the other, they're wrapped up in it.	0
ClaimBuster	5370				And when it comes to our economy here at home, I know what it takes to create 12 million new jobs and rising take-home pay.	0
ClaimBuster	5371				Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel.	1
ClaimBuster	5372				Charter schools, I doubled the number of charter schools in Illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions.	1
ClaimBuster	5373				You all just heard my plan.	1
ClaimBuster	5374				I do not, very frankly, take seriously the Congressional Budget Office projections, because they have been wrong on virtually all of them, including the fact that our recovery wasn't going to take place to begin with.	0
ClaimBuster	5375				In the old days we'd see a threat, and we could deal with it if we felt like it or not.	0
ClaimBuster	5376				We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her.	0
ClaimBuster	5377				War has been the constant companion of mankind, so to have these weapons disseminated around the world, I believe means that we're going to move through a period of hazard in the next few years.	0
ClaimBuster	5378				All of this can be cured and all of it can be solved.	0
ClaimBuster	5379				I like the fact that in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together.	1
ClaimBuster	5380				But here again, I don't know which George Bush I'm listening to.	0
ClaimBuster	5381				We do those things, not only is your future going to be bright but America's future is going to bright as well.	0
ClaimBuster	5382				And it will be fun if we all work together to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	5383				They have to make sure that they're cooperating with us when it comes to counterterrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	5384				We have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads right now on land, on sea and in the air, enough to blow up the Soviet Union forty times over.	1
ClaimBuster	5385				All those changes in our tax code would make a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	5386				That extends the life of Social Security for 55 years.	1
ClaimBuster	5387				One of the areas, and of course the most vulnerable area is - I have felt, has been Eastern Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	5388				I want to get to Medicare in a second.	0
ClaimBuster	5389				He claims it will be out of Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	5390				If I may take the bills, we did pass in the Senate a bill uh - to provide a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage.	1
ClaimBuster	5391				The breach on the agreement is highly enriched uranium.	1
ClaimBuster	5392				Number 3, if the people really have a mind to change, they can.	0
ClaimBuster	5393				I love the optimism in that painting, because that's how I feel about America.	0
ClaimBuster	5394				I want you to know I care passionately about this and I will fight until it becomes law.	0
ClaimBuster	5395				He hasn't had help from the administration, from the Congress, to carry this out.	1
ClaimBuster	5396				We're becoming more and more of a melting pot.	0
ClaimBuster	5397				Well, if it's in our vital national interests, and that means whether our territory is threatened or people could be harmed, whether or not the alliances are -- our defense alliances are threatened, whether or not our friends in the Middle East are threatened.	0
ClaimBuster	5398				Wages are goings up for the first time in a decade.	1
ClaimBuster	5399				My opponent just said something amazing.	0
ClaimBuster	5400				It runs a minimum of thirteen and two-tenths billions dollars a year more than we are presently spending to a maximum of eighteen billion dollars a year more than we're presently spending.	1
ClaimBuster	5401				Now it seems to me that uh - as we look at the recommendations of the budget committees and our own projections, there isn't going to be any $60 billion dividend.	1
ClaimBuster	5402				Now as far as President Eisenhower is concerned, I have often heard him discuss this question.	1
ClaimBuster	5403				They don't want to see protectionism.	0
ClaimBuster	5404				So it isn't worth the paper it's printed on.	0
ClaimBuster	5405				We've got to grow the economy by putting people first -- real people like you.	0
ClaimBuster	5406				I don't think the American people are getting their money's worth from the majority party that run this Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	5407				The Administration has vetoed that bill passed by the Congress twice.	1
ClaimBuster	5408				It means that the United States must have a strong diplomatic hand with our friends in NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	5409				I know we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America.	0
ClaimBuster	5410				And that's what I did, sir.	1
ClaimBuster	5411				I believe in building safe zones.	0
ClaimBuster	5412				He is for full public financing of Congressional elections.	1
ClaimBuster	5413				But, you see, my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible.	0
ClaimBuster	5414				We went into Russia, we said here is some IMF money, and it ended up in Viktor Chemomyrdin's pocket, and others, and yet we played like there was reform.	1
ClaimBuster	5415				I'm not running for the Presidency because I believe that I can solve the problems we've discussed tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	5416				Could I respond to that, Jim?	0
ClaimBuster	5417				Yes, we had grain credits for Iraq, and there isn't any evidence that those grain credits were diverted into weaponry -- none, none whatsoever.	1
ClaimBuster	5418				There are great public schools where there's public school choice, accountability and brilliant principals.	0
ClaimBuster	5419				Mostly that's just me opposing George Bush's wrong headed policies since I've been in Congress but I think it is that it is also important to recognize I worked with Tom Coburn, the most conservative, one of the most conservative Republicans who John already mentioned to set up what we call a Google for government saying we'll list every dollar of federal spending to make sure that the taxpayer can take a look and see who, in fact, is promoting some of these spending projects that John's been railing about.	1
ClaimBuster	5420				We're not going to touch Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	5421				Nobody wants gridlock anymore, and so let's get the program through.	0
ClaimBuster	5422				The key is whether or not we've got priorities that are working for you as opposed to those who have been dictating the policy in Washington lately, and that's mostly lobbyists and special interests.	1
ClaimBuster	5423				Now, the G-8 is one of those, but there are many others.	1
ClaimBuster	5424				And we paid down the debt of our nation for two years in a row, and we created 23 million new jobs at the same time.	1
ClaimBuster	5425				And he said the mark of a good judge, good justice, is that when you're reading their decision, their opinion, you can't tell if it's written by a man or woman, a liberal or a conservative, a Muslim, a Jew or a Christian.	0
ClaimBuster	5426				We need to put the responsibilities back on the cabinet members.	0
ClaimBuster	5427				They don't vote for war.	0
ClaimBuster	5428				Now, specifically, one, on Medicare, it is not true that everyone knows how to fix it.	0
ClaimBuster	5429				Let me do first on a personal level.	0
ClaimBuster	5430				Part of it is seeing if we can get automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.	0
ClaimBuster	5431				They analyzed the senator's plan.	1
ClaimBuster	5432				She understands that autism is on the rise, that we've got to find out what's causing it, and we've got to reach out to these families, and help them, and give them the help they need as they raise these very special needs children.	1
ClaimBuster	5433				Now when they talk about our record here, it is well that they recognize that they have to stand up for their record as well.	0
ClaimBuster	5434				The anti-Washington feeling, in my opinion, ought to be focused on the Congress of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	5435				Now, I hope people understand that Medicare today is important, but it doesn't keep up with the new medicines.	0
ClaimBuster	5436				Who has the experience that we trust?	0
ClaimBuster	5437				We've had 25 years of very good cooperation.	1
ClaimBuster	5438				Either they provide health insurance to their employees or somebody has to.	0
ClaimBuster	5439				Please don't get into the Washington Post.	0
ClaimBuster	5440				It's another to be certain and be right, or to be certain and be moving in the right direction, or be certain about a principle and then learn new facts and take those new facts and put them to use in order to change and get your policy right.	0
ClaimBuster	5441				That was a great doctrine throughout the Cold War.	0
ClaimBuster	5442				This affects human beings, and - and his insensitivity in providing those people a chance to work has made this a welfare administration, and not a work administration.	0
ClaimBuster	5443				The constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she had been raped or suffered from incest.	1
ClaimBuster	5444				Governor Clinton has to operate under a balanced budget amendment -- he has to do it, that is the law.	1
ClaimBuster	5445				And I will be a good president.	0
ClaimBuster	5446				The question now is: Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack - attack it has ever known?	0
ClaimBuster	5447				And I think the three of us have one view and the Governor has another view.	0
ClaimBuster	5448				The president wants it, but we can't get it because we sit here in gridlock because it's a campaign year.	0
ClaimBuster	5449				I'm not satisfied when I see men like Jimmy Hoffa - in charge of the largest union in the United States - still free.	1
ClaimBuster	5450				He would actually have to cut Government spending by at least $130 billion in order to balance the budget under this ridiculous proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	5451				I did give about six months before the effective date of the act before lawsuits can actually be filed, even though they're effective now, and can be legally binding, because I want to change Cuba.	1
ClaimBuster	5452				He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.	1
ClaimBuster	5453				Even though I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them.	1
ClaimBuster	5454				And with that thought, I realized what a job I had with that letter.	0
ClaimBuster	5455				We think that's pretty good progress.	0
ClaimBuster	5456				I will never send troops anywhere on a mission of that kind without telling them that if somebody shoots at them, they can darn well shoot back.	0
ClaimBuster	5457				I oppose it for the reasons that I mentioned.	0
ClaimBuster	5458				Right, thank you for that.	0
ClaimBuster	5459				I have laid out a different plan, because the president's plan is not working.	0
ClaimBuster	5460				And there are several there's a good political reason because it's just about this time of year that the Democrats start saying the Republicans are going to take away your Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	5461				They've got to turn off the TV set, put away the video games, and, finally, start instilling that thirst for knowledge that our students need.	0
ClaimBuster	5462				China has an interest that's very much like ours in one respect, and that is they want a stable world.	1
ClaimBuster	5463				Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank.	1
ClaimBuster	5464				That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	5465				I've a plan in my budget to recruit 100,000 new, highly qualified teachers and to help local school districts build new schools.	1
ClaimBuster	5466				I believe you can protect the environment and grow the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	5467				It was a new negotiation because, as I say, President Ford was within about 10% of having a solution that could be acceptable.	0
ClaimBuster	5468				And you're wondering, how's it going to affect me?	0
ClaimBuster	5469				(Laughter) You don't want us to mention appointees, but when you see the quality of people in our administration, see how Colin Powell performed -- I say administration --	0
ClaimBuster	5470				It has grown in the past seven years.	1
ClaimBuster	5471				Now we will probably need to increase that to same extent.	0
ClaimBuster	5472				"I know that the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody, and a lot of people might be interested in Senator Obama's definition of ""rich."""	0
ClaimBuster	5473				And the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we're going to be in a position to show that costs are going down.	0
ClaimBuster	5474				I was honored to be there.	0
ClaimBuster	5475				There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say it's completely wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	5476				We used to have 18.	1
ClaimBuster	5477				I think we've dramatically changed the world.	0
ClaimBuster	5478				The formal doctrine is very arcane, but I'm going to ask you to deal with it anyway.	0
ClaimBuster	5479				The farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	5480				You've got to reform Congress, they've got to be servants of the people again; you've got to reform the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	5481				And, you know, I've got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	5482				Credit card debt has never been higher.	1
ClaimBuster	5483				Not just to you, but to the entire nation.	0
ClaimBuster	5484				The fact remains almost 30% of his proposed tax cut goes to -- only to Americans that make more than $1 million per year.	1
ClaimBuster	5485				If you'd just tell us what you're going to do, then the American people could compare my plan for the future with your plan.	0
ClaimBuster	5486				Do we spend money on that weapon system in the billions and trillions, or is providing some decent and affordable housing for families of this country something that is at least as important and probably more so.	0
ClaimBuster	5487				Because it's the cornerstone of reform in the State of Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	5488				Soldiers must understand why we're going.	0
ClaimBuster	5489				But I have a plan to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	5490				And that's -- that's -- that's an unfortunate part.	0
ClaimBuster	5491				And therefore, the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care.	1
ClaimBuster	5492				Many inner-city kids just move through.	1
ClaimBuster	5493				Well, we do come from different places.	1
ClaimBuster	5494				And I don't think this Administration has shown the foresight, has shown the knowledge, has been identified with the great fight which these people are waging to be free, to get a better standard of living, to live better.	0
ClaimBuster	5495				Who would have 1200 airplanes worth 2 billion a year just to fly around in?	0
ClaimBuster	5496				Why shouldn't low income Americans and low middle income Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	5497				Here we have a situation which causes all of us concern - causes us concern because of the denial of the rights of people to the equality which we think belongs to everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	5498				And that has been a culture in Washington that has been taking place for too long.	0
ClaimBuster	5499				And as we move during the next four years, those will be the policies of this administration.	0
ClaimBuster	5500				The Constitution of the United States says we're all -- you know, it doesn't say that.	0
ClaimBuster	5501				If you don't have health insurance or you want to buy into a group plan, you will be able to buy into the plan that I just described.	0
ClaimBuster	5502				What I have proposed for a long time, and I've had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies, let's be clear and let's have some straight talk.	0
ClaimBuster	5503				We gave Ambassador Glaspie written instructions.	1
ClaimBuster	5504				Forty years ago, when I was 8 years old, he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group.	1
ClaimBuster	5505				We imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same date just a year ago.	1
ClaimBuster	5506				Middle-income people are going to get a tax break.	1
ClaimBuster	5507				Many say four and a half per cent.	0
ClaimBuster	5508				They're almost at the bottom on every single category.	1
ClaimBuster	5509				And as for why it happened, I'm no expert on the Texas procedures, but what my friends there tell me is that the governor opposed a measure put forward by Democrats in the legislature to expand the number of children that would be covered.	1
ClaimBuster	5510				And I think a critical component of success in Iraq is being able to convince the Iraqis and the Arab world that the United States doesn't have long-term designs on it.	0
ClaimBuster	5511				Some presidents have been strong in foreign policy; others have relied heavily on the secretary of state.	0
ClaimBuster	5512				I think it's important for NATO to be strong and confident.	0
ClaimBuster	5513				But they were not in accordance with international law.	1
ClaimBuster	5514				I am a free trader.	1
ClaimBuster	5515				I was in coal country.	1
ClaimBuster	5516				We have to have control over inflation, and we also have to have a favorable balance of trade.	0
ClaimBuster	5517				That's how you determine if children are progressing to excellence.	0
ClaimBuster	5518				We do more good things for more people in our communities, our neighborhoods, than anywhere that I know of.	0
ClaimBuster	5519				I said in 1992 he didn't extend that courtesy to President Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	5520				We have -- we have a president talking about someone's plan in a way that's completely foreign to what my real plan is.	0
ClaimBuster	5521				And they don't want them.	0
ClaimBuster	5522				Without any doubt, I have stood up and told the American people that that $263 billion deficit must come down.	1
ClaimBuster	5523				North Korea, first, I do.	0
ClaimBuster	5524				I'm watching Hillary go over facts.	0
ClaimBuster	5525				Mr. President, I'd like to head for the fence and try to catch that one before it goes over, but I'll go on to another question.	0
ClaimBuster	5526				But that doesn't mean that we don't have a long way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	5527				The national intelligence assessment that was given to the president in July said, best-case scenario, more of the same of what we see today; worst-case scenario, civil war.	1
ClaimBuster	5528				A mayor of a city like New York, for instance, needs to know uh - eighteen months or two years ahead of time what responsibility the city will have in administration and in financing - in things like housing, uh - pollution control, uh - crime control, education, welfare and health.	0
ClaimBuster	5529				He raises his right hand and takes an oath of office to take care to faithfully execute the laws of the land.	0
ClaimBuster	5530				But ultimately, we've got to pay for the core investments that make this economy strong and somebody's got to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	5531				But I think that we -- I think we have to start with better parenting.	0
ClaimBuster	5532				He still believes it's a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	5533				And if Obamacare is passed, or implemented -- it's already been passed -- if it's implemented fully, it'll be another $2,500 on top.	1
ClaimBuster	5534				Now, under my proposal, for every dollar that I propose in spending for things like education and health care, I will put another dollar into middle class tax cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	5535				This president didn't stand up for Boeing when Airbus was violating international rules and subsidies.	1
ClaimBuster	5536				And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.	0
ClaimBuster	5537				We've got a bumper crop this year.	1
ClaimBuster	5538				At the same time, if we can have a 4-percent recovery continue through that same period of time, that will mean -- without an increase in tax rates -- that will mean $400 billion more in government revenues.	1
ClaimBuster	5539				We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.	1
ClaimBuster	5540				Obviously it has a lot to do with interest rates --	0
ClaimBuster	5541				That's exactly where we find ourselves today.	0
ClaimBuster	5542				You will decide whether we're going to keep fighting crime with a Brady Bill, assault weapons and finish putting those 100,000 police.	0
ClaimBuster	5543				You talk about the surge.	0
ClaimBuster	5544				We've had the Central Accounting.	1
ClaimBuster	5545				We can work on nuclear power plants.	0
ClaimBuster	5546				That leaves all of you who live in the other 50 states without an education reform policy from Senator McCain.	1
ClaimBuster	5547				He has taken the position, when he first indicated in October of last year, that he would even favor compulsory arbitration as one of the weapons the president might have to stop a national emergency strike.	1
ClaimBuster	5548				That boo was excessively loud.	0
ClaimBuster	5549				And the last point I'll make, because we started on energy.	0
ClaimBuster	5550				And you know it, and they know it, and everybody knows it.	0
ClaimBuster	5551				And I mentioned one, and that's the Balkans.	0
ClaimBuster	5552				And I think it's this pattern that troubles me, more than the draft.	0
ClaimBuster	5553				Well, maybe someday, somebody can dream of that.	0
ClaimBuster	5554				Imagine if we had pulled out at that point.	0
ClaimBuster	5555				This is about bringing good jobs back for the middle class of America, and that's what I'm going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	5556				We've always had at least 7 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	5557				My call to our fellow Americans is if you're healthy, if you're younger, don't get a flu shot this year.	0
ClaimBuster	5558				Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan.	0
ClaimBuster	5559				And we did drive them to the negotiating table.	0
ClaimBuster	5560				I think it's much less than it was the day after 9/11.	0
ClaimBuster	5561				There was a lot at stake there, my friends.	0
ClaimBuster	5562				I would take the use of force very seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	5563				We have reduced the number of troops that are deployed and going to be deployed.	1
ClaimBuster	5564				Those are the questions to which the president must establish a moral tone and moral leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	5565				You know who voted for it?	0
ClaimBuster	5566				I hope I'm that person.	0
ClaimBuster	5567				And that's what America is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	5568				Anyway, let me quote the Lewin report.	0
ClaimBuster	5569				You, it's amazing to me, you are all for having more responsibility at the local level for everything except schools.	0
ClaimBuster	5570				So the price of oil has been way down.	1
ClaimBuster	5571				It may be necessary for us to begin testing again.	0
ClaimBuster	5572				If we invest in a serious energy policy, that will save in the amount of money we're borrowing from China to send to Saudi Arabia.	0
ClaimBuster	5573				Under no circumstances would I do anything other than to help this industry get on its feet.	0
ClaimBuster	5574				That's how strongly I feel about it.	0
ClaimBuster	5575				He knew these flights were going on long before and that wasn't the reason that he broke up the conference.	1
ClaimBuster	5576				I propose $2 billion worth.	0
ClaimBuster	5577				But in the last uh - twenty-four months we've turned the economy around and we've brought inflation down to under 6 percent, and we have reduced the uh - well, we have added employment of about four million in the last seventeen months to the point where we have eighty-eight million people working in America today - the most in the history of the country.	1
ClaimBuster	5578				I applaud the no-fly zone, and I know that he's going back to the United Nations to try to get authority to enforce it.	0
ClaimBuster	5579				Governor Romney doesn't have a five-point plan.	0
ClaimBuster	5580				You'll get an access to life-long learning and education, help with tuition if you want to get a new skill or training.	1
ClaimBuster	5581				A promise made will be a promise kept.	0
ClaimBuster	5582				I think the American people tonight have much to be grateful for -- an economic recovery that has become expansion, freedom and, most of all, we are at peace.	1
ClaimBuster	5583				And during that time, he voted 23 times against alternative fuels, 23 times.	1
ClaimBuster	5584				And that is, in fact, I was wrong when I said the president isn't proposing any changes for current retirees.	1
ClaimBuster	5585				I believe part of a hopeful society is one in which somebody owns something.	0
ClaimBuster	5586				That is a basic decision that has to be made so frequently, by every President who serves.	0
ClaimBuster	5587				We're talk about those two paths.	0
ClaimBuster	5588				Meg Whitman was CEO of a company that started with 12 people and is now 1.3 million people in America make their living off eBay.	1
ClaimBuster	5589				They're smart enough to know that's not a good trade.	0
ClaimBuster	5590				Well, I think the president of the United States last winter indicated that before he'd go to the summit in May he did last fall, he indicated that there should be some agenda, that there should be some prior agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	5591				It's a school of strong discipline and high standards.	0
ClaimBuster	5592				And so I believe that we've got to get the power in the hands of the teachers, not the teachers' union.	0
ClaimBuster	5593				And we'll continue to spend money on research and development, because I truly believe that's the way to get from how we live today to being able to live a standard of living that we're accustomed to and being able to protect our environment better, the use of technologies.	0
ClaimBuster	5594				When the president ran for office, he said if you build a coal plant, you can go ahead, but you'll go bankrupt.	1
ClaimBuster	5595				First of all, let's talk about this troop funding issue because John always brings this up.	1
ClaimBuster	5596				This kind of deterioration in our economic strength is bound to weaken us around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	5597				But not until they have given us the full accounting of our MIAs.	0
ClaimBuster	5598				That's not the way we should judge these nominees.	0
ClaimBuster	5599				I believe I'm going to win, because the American people know I know how to lead.	0
ClaimBuster	5600				I have met met uh - decisions over eight hundred times on matters which affect not only the domestic security of the United States, but as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.	1
ClaimBuster	5601				And I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake.	0
ClaimBuster	5602				My friend, Phyllis Hunter, is here.	1
ClaimBuster	5603				And I think the hug Tom Daschle gave him at that moment was about as genuine a sense of there being no Democrats, no Republicans, we were all just Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	5604				We've got some long-term challenges in this economy that have to be dealt with.	0
ClaimBuster	5605				We're going to have to have employers in the new economy, in the economy I'm going to bring to play, that are going to be so anxious to get good workers they're going to be anxious to hire women.	0
ClaimBuster	5606				Senator Kennedy has put a great deal of stress on the necessity for economic assistance.	0
ClaimBuster	5607				But there's a record, and that's what I hope people look at.	1
ClaimBuster	5608				We passed it out of the House of Representatives.	1
ClaimBuster	5609				I'll go one step further.	0
ClaimBuster	5610				They would know how we solved them, and whether our solution was beneficial to them down through the years or whether it hurt them.	0
ClaimBuster	5611				One final point: President Reagan, as Governor of California, signed a bill which is perhaps the most liberal proabortion bill of any State in the Union.	1
ClaimBuster	5612				And I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it.	0
ClaimBuster	5613				In the next four years, I want to focus on the following things.	0
ClaimBuster	5614				Do I have 1 minute?	0
ClaimBuster	5615				But let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods.	0
ClaimBuster	5616				And because we're going to move in sixty-one and two, partly because we have not maintained our strength with sufficient vigor in the last years, I believe that before we meet that crisis, that the next president of the United States should send a message to Congress asking for a revitalization of our military strength, because come spring or late in the winter we're going to be face to face with the most serious Berlin crisis since l949 or fifty.	0
ClaimBuster	5617				You're going to see a lot of people fall over it, because any time you're spending $199 billion dollars a year, somebody's getting it.	1
ClaimBuster	5618				And they've poisoned the mind of the voters.	0
ClaimBuster	5619				In fact, he said he wants to announce that he's going to attack Pakistan.	1
ClaimBuster	5620				And the last thing I'd like to say is this: This grain deal with the Soviet Union in '72 was terrible, and Mr. Ford made up for it with three embargoes, one against our own ally in Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	5621				I think it's accurate to say that Mr. Ford voted against the uh - Voting Rights Acts and the uh - Civil Rights Acts in their uh - debative stage I think once it was assured they were going to pass he finally voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	5622				That we're a nation under God.	0
ClaimBuster	5623				It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information -- in administrations...	1
ClaimBuster	5624				I saved the taxpayer $6.8 billion by fighting a deal for a couple of years, as you might recall, that was a sweetheart deal between an aircraft manufacturer, DOD, and people ended up in jail.	1
ClaimBuster	5625				How about Dr. Lou Sullivan?	0
ClaimBuster	5626				And we said, hey, we've got to unleash the Bush kids.	0
ClaimBuster	5627				All of them with little or no health insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	5628				With regard to the great progress that has been made with this Government spending, the rate of black unemployment in Detroit, Michigan, is 56%.	1
ClaimBuster	5629				I feel that the taxpayers are the ones that need the relief: I don't think we should add additional programs of the magnitude that Governor Carter talks about.	0
ClaimBuster	5630				And I understand they do include investments outside the United States, including in -- in Chinese companies.	1
ClaimBuster	5631				But nevertheless, I support my nominee for Vice President and he'll do an outstanding job.	0
ClaimBuster	5632				But actually limited government can work in the second largest state in the union.	0
ClaimBuster	5633				Sure, but the problem is, you get so many things included in a great big bill that you have to look at the overall good.	0
ClaimBuster	5634				I said we had too many slums.	0
ClaimBuster	5635				The right course for America is to have a true all-of-the-above policy.	0
ClaimBuster	5636				Ninety percent of the casualties are American.	1
ClaimBuster	5637				If we could stop, right now, the testing and the deployment of these space weapons -- and the President's proposals go clear beyond research; if it was just research we wouldn't have any argument, because maybe someday, somebody will think of something -- but to commit this nation to a buildup of antisatellite and space weapons at this time, in their crude state, would bring about an arms race that's very dangerous indeed.	0
ClaimBuster	5638				So I've got a history of reaching across the aisle.	1
ClaimBuster	5639				Under this administration that strength has not been realized.	0
ClaimBuster	5640				If you were going to pass something in the Congress, you had to show where you are going to pay for it and how.	0
ClaimBuster	5641				I owe everything to you, the people of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	5642				It's the only way that we're going to move ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	5643				We'd have that trouble all over America.	0
ClaimBuster	5644				But I want to answer as specifically as I can the question that you have just put to me.	0
ClaimBuster	5645				But the energy - uh policy of our nation is one that uh has not yet been established under this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	5646				Do you realize today in America, we spend $73 billion to help 10 million low- and middle-income families better afford college?	1
ClaimBuster	5647				We didn't put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they're going to receive.	1
ClaimBuster	5648				We have protected 25 million people through the passage of the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that says you can use your health insurance if you change jobs or someone in your family has been sick.	1
ClaimBuster	5649				I don't think my opponent has got the right view about the world to make us safe; I really don't.	0
ClaimBuster	5650				Secondly, the economic growth of the Soviet Union is greater than ours.	1
ClaimBuster	5651				If you want somebody who believes that we were better off eight years ago than we are now and that we ought to go back to the kind of policies that we had back then, emphasizing tax cuts mainly for the wealthy, here is your man.	0
ClaimBuster	5652				"But again, I want to come back to, notice every time Senator Obama says, ""We need to spend more, we need to spend more, that's the answer"" -- why do we always have to spend more?"	0
ClaimBuster	5653				"And then she said, ""But, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything -- promise me one thing, that you'll do everything in your power to make sure that my son's death was not in vain."""	1
ClaimBuster	5654				That's unacceptable for us, and it's essential for a president to show strength from the very beginning, to make it very clear what is acceptable and not acceptable.	0
ClaimBuster	5655				So -- and you launched your political campaign in Mr. Ayers' living room.	1
ClaimBuster	5656				Then he goes on to say that he's going to change the interest-rate situation and we're going to get some more money that way.	0
ClaimBuster	5657				As a matter of fact, today the shortages of non-commissioned officers that John mentioned are such that if we tried to have a draft today, we wouldn't have the non-commissioned officers to train the draftees.	1
ClaimBuster	5658				Secondly, that I think it's important to reach out to moderate Arab nations, like Jordan and Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.	0
ClaimBuster	5659				Those are decisions that the chief executive has to make.	0
ClaimBuster	5660				And I'd like each person to say did I jump to conclusions running down rumors that were so outrageous and so brutal.	0
ClaimBuster	5661				And I will tell you that I'm going to make our country safe.	0
ClaimBuster	5662				And it's because of my belief that if America is going to have the growth that he talks about and that I talk about and that we want, the thing to do is not to discourage individual enterprise, not to discourage people to go out and discover more oil and minerals, but to encourage them.	0
ClaimBuster	5663				And so, the plan that I have proposed - and contrary to what John says, my plan is for a phased-in tax cut over a three-year period, tax increase and depreciation allowances for business and industry to give them the capital to refurbish plant and equipment, research and development, improved technology - all of which we see our foreign competitors having, and we have the greatest percentage of outmoded industrial plant and equipment of any of the industrial nations - produce more, have stable money supply, and give the people of this country a greater share of their own savings.	0
ClaimBuster	5664				I will not do anything to affect the rights of hunters or sportsmen.	0
ClaimBuster	5665				I don't have any speechwriters.	1
ClaimBuster	5666				If you make more than $25,000 a year you don't get a penny of help under the Bush prescription drug proposal for at least four to five years, and then you're pushed into a Medicare -- into an HMO or insurance company plan, and there's no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the conditions.	1
ClaimBuster	5667				He also wants to continue the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	5668				I know they're all for education in science and training, which I strongly support.	0
ClaimBuster	5669				That is the growth that we are looking for; it is the growth that this Administration has supported and that its policies have stimulated.	0
ClaimBuster	5670				It is our greatest ally in the region.	1
ClaimBuster	5671				When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high.	1
ClaimBuster	5672				I don't think we can turn over these kinds of decisions of the collective defense to the United Nations or anything else.	0
ClaimBuster	5673				But it is things that people say.	0
ClaimBuster	5674				We have to be bold.	0
ClaimBuster	5675				But I wanted the American people to know I was willing to give up something.	0
ClaimBuster	5676				But this issue of certainty.	0
ClaimBuster	5677				Mr. Nixon suggests uh - that the United States should go to war if these two islands are attacked.	1
ClaimBuster	5678				We didn't have a lot of chance to talk about this in the last debate.	1
ClaimBuster	5679				Many people are predicting a recession.	0
ClaimBuster	5680				We can work with them on security matters, for example, but it's their call to make.	0
ClaimBuster	5681				And we are now in a position where we have met many of the objectives that got us there in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	5682				The United States of America took the initiative in southern Africa.	0
ClaimBuster	5683				Which our country should do, too.	0
ClaimBuster	5684				Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don't get.	1
ClaimBuster	5685				The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control.	0
ClaimBuster	5686				My opponent thinks the government -- the surplus is the government's money.	0
ClaimBuster	5687				Isn't it time to do it?	0
ClaimBuster	5688				So we're distributing in our State of Texas for free.	1
ClaimBuster	5689				But I'll tell you this.	0
ClaimBuster	5690				Well, in the uh - last two years, as I indicated before, we had a very tough time.	1
ClaimBuster	5691				We have got to have the courage to change.	0
ClaimBuster	5692				Not labels that we attach to each other, questions about each other's patriotism and loyalty.	0
ClaimBuster	5693				And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.	0
ClaimBuster	5694				Not because I am preaching to the people of the South because this isn't just a Southern problem; it's a Northern problem and a Western problem; it's a problem for all of us.	0
ClaimBuster	5695				We ought to help move a million people from welfare to work and we ought to create the finest education system in the world where every 18-year-old can go on to college and all of our younger children have great educational opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	5696				But we've got to get costs down.	0
ClaimBuster	5697				I think medical care should go with the person.	0
ClaimBuster	5698				But it was done three years ago and they're still putting pressure on us from the Arab countries to our discredit around the world.	1
ClaimBuster	5699				You don't negotiate with Mr. Brezhnev from weakness.	0
ClaimBuster	5700				And finally, we were a party to the convention -- to working with Germany, France and Great Britain to send their foreign ministers into Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	5701				It doesn't uh - make a determination as to how uh - that relationship should be achieved in relationship to our current uhh - diplomatic recognition and obligations to the Taiwanese Government.	0
ClaimBuster	5702				But this is another example where I think it is important to look at the record.	0
ClaimBuster	5703				Jim, we've got the capability of doing both.	0
ClaimBuster	5704				We'll take the proper action at the proper time.	0
ClaimBuster	5705				It's bigger than our respective parties.	0
ClaimBuster	5706				We're on the side of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	5707				Look, she's been proven to be a liar on so many different ways.	1
ClaimBuster	5708				And as a consequence, veterans' unemployment is actually now lower than general population.	1
ClaimBuster	5709				In the Oval Office, there's a painting by a friend of Laura and mine named -- by Tom Lee.	1
ClaimBuster	5710				And so I don't know the man well, but I've been disappointed about how he and his administration have conducted the fundraising affairs.	0
ClaimBuster	5711				But in -- oh, but I do.	0
ClaimBuster	5712				And I can tell you right now that Senator Obama would have brought our troops home in defeat.	0
ClaimBuster	5713				First, I think Mary Fisher was a great choice.	0
ClaimBuster	5714				So I'll look at every place where we're investing money.	0
ClaimBuster	5715				Mr. President, you measure it by whether you're getting the job done.	0
ClaimBuster	5716				... you may not be able to have insurance because you can't afford it.	0
ClaimBuster	5717				But we have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out.	0
ClaimBuster	5718				You've seen co-pays go up, deductibles go up.	1
ClaimBuster	5719				I'll tell you what I think has been the most outrageous thing in political dialog, both in this campaign and the one in '82.	0
ClaimBuster	5720				We have to provide leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	5721				In fact, I used to go home, my mother would tell me, Bob, all I've got is my Social Security and my Medicare, don't cut it.	1
ClaimBuster	5722				And we hope that their leadership takes the right decision, but the deal we'll accept is they end their nuclear program.	0
ClaimBuster	5723				I mean, I think in general, let's talk about these issues.	0
ClaimBuster	5724				Obviously some people are going to need help.	0
ClaimBuster	5725				And it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	5726				But most importantly, we're going to have to help ordinary families be able to stay in their homes, make sure that they can pay their bills, deal with critical issues like health care and energy, and we're going to have to change the culture in Washington so that lobbyists and special interests aren't driving the process and your voices aren't being drowned out.	0
ClaimBuster	5727				The President's record is quite different.	0
ClaimBuster	5728				He also promised America that he would go to war as a last resort.	1
ClaimBuster	5729				First of all, 30,000 people being killed by their government is a humanitarian disaster.	1
ClaimBuster	5730				All groups of people are growing.	1
ClaimBuster	5731				This seems to be a trend.	0
ClaimBuster	5732				I certainly didn't feel I should commit American troops to throw him out of where he had gone, and that was the only way to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	5733				And, yet, after sitting through meeting after meeting, he endorsed that decision, endorsed the sale of arms to the Ayatollah in exchange for hostages, one of the most tragic, one of the most mistaken foreign policy decisions we've ever made in this country and I dare say encouraged others to take hostages as we now know.	1
ClaimBuster	5734				Typical cost to you and me is $125,000.	1
ClaimBuster	5735				And they're starting to finally make progress.	0
ClaimBuster	5736				OK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied.	0
ClaimBuster	5737				And I'm paying for all that for those guys.	1
ClaimBuster	5738				With respect to partial-birth abortion, I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there's an exception for the mother's health and life, and this did not contain that exception.	1
ClaimBuster	5739				And we're going to build the strongest international network to prevent nuclear proliferation.	0
ClaimBuster	5740				He was borrowing $14 million from his father to start his businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	5741				You know who voted against it?	0
ClaimBuster	5742				I'd have made a better choice.	0
ClaimBuster	5743				And now the tax code is more fair.	0
ClaimBuster	5744				So that's not where we ought to go.	0
ClaimBuster	5745				Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy.	1
ClaimBuster	5746				And I ask for your support for 4 more years to finish this job.	0
ClaimBuster	5747				And we're making some progress, doing a little better on interdiction.	1
ClaimBuster	5748				I'm going to give you a tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	5749				And I can tell you right now the security of your young men and women who are serving in the military are my first priority right after our nation's security.	0
ClaimBuster	5750				Well, Chris, I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the Social Security Trust Fund.	1
ClaimBuster	5751				My biggest disappointment in Washington is how partisan the town is.	0
ClaimBuster	5752				But look, this has been going on for a year.	1
ClaimBuster	5753				We've got to take this in a new direction, that's what I propose as president.	0
ClaimBuster	5754				Governor Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that Al Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not Al Qaida; you said Russia, in the 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years.	1
ClaimBuster	5755				It's going to require somebody who can work across the partisan divide.	0
ClaimBuster	5756				That's the country that I'm going to fight for.	0
ClaimBuster	5757				I'm deeply concerned that judges are making those decisions and not the citizenry of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	5758				But why shouldn't everybody have that choice.	0
ClaimBuster	5759				I told you never would I do such a thing.	0
ClaimBuster	5760				When President Bush decided we're not going to talk to Iran, we're not going to talk to North Korea, you know what happened?	0
ClaimBuster	5761				And we are helping democracy, Ross.	0
ClaimBuster	5762				If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good.	0
ClaimBuster	5763				His experience has been different from mine.	0
ClaimBuster	5764				They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is.	0
ClaimBuster	5765				And -- and I know that we can reprocess the spent nuclear fuel.	0
ClaimBuster	5766				I hear there's rumors on the Internets (sic) that we're going to have a draft.	0
ClaimBuster	5767				I look around the world, I don't see our influence growing around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	5768				And as soon as we have an investigation and find out where any blame lies for the few that did not get excised or changed, we certainly are going to do something about that.	0
ClaimBuster	5769				... because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do, except even more so.	1
ClaimBuster	5770				It will be a growing and a closer relationship.	0
ClaimBuster	5771				And that's the kind of tough trade actions that are required.	0
ClaimBuster	5772				The government pays for Medicare and Medicaid, as you know, and that's very important.	1
ClaimBuster	5773				There are more people in poverty, one out of six people in poverty.	1
ClaimBuster	5774				I think we need to invest and save more.	0
ClaimBuster	5775				Take for example the marriage penalty.	0
ClaimBuster	5776				Well, we're on the right track.	0
ClaimBuster	5777				So our proposals are very sound and very carefully considered to stimulate jobs, to improve the industrial complex of this country, to create tools for American workers, and at the same time would be anti-inflationary in nature.	0
ClaimBuster	5778				And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions.	1
ClaimBuster	5779				Now, I can't say when this can come.	0
ClaimBuster	5780				It is going to take us to much better advantage in conventional forces.	0
ClaimBuster	5781				I don't think they're right to try to take the tax exemption away from the Catholic Church.	0
ClaimBuster	5782				I appointed a four-star general who led our efforts south of the border to keep drugs from coming into the country as our nation's drug czar.	1
ClaimBuster	5783				The great threat to our country is that these haters end up with weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	5784				And it works- -it works in Milwaukee.	1
ClaimBuster	5785				I took the pledge we'd cut it out.	0
ClaimBuster	5786				I don't agree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	5787				We have an opportunity to have real leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	5788				We also ought to convert more vehicles to compressed natural gas.	0
ClaimBuster	5789				But I don't think it's fair.	0
ClaimBuster	5790				When a factory closes, I know the people who ran it.	1
ClaimBuster	5791				I love the strong women around me.	0
ClaimBuster	5792				"I sit on the Veterans Affairs Committee, and we've got -- I meet veterans all across the country who are trying to figure out, ""How can I get disability payments?"	1
ClaimBuster	5793				That's why I am advocating, and will develop during the course of the next Administration - if, of course, I get the opportunity - a program in which we enlist more aid from these other countries on a concerted basis in the programs of economic development for Africa, Asia and Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	5794				This has not been done, unfortunately.	0
ClaimBuster	5795				Three, we have to consolidate the federal programs to free districts to free the schools and encourage innovators like Michael.	0
ClaimBuster	5796				My opponent had trouble, criticized us, on our policy in Angola.	1
ClaimBuster	5797				20 or 25 birds were killed and brought out a migratory bird act to go after them on a criminal basis.	1
ClaimBuster	5798				Proud that they voted hopefully for me.	0
ClaimBuster	5799				We expect to have a lower deficit in fiscal year 1978.	0
ClaimBuster	5800				I think Mr. Nixon is an effective leader of his party.	0
ClaimBuster	5801				When you have a report, as we did recently, that six out of 10 CONUS Divisions in this country - Continental United States Army Divisions - simply could not pass a readiness test: that two out of three divisions that were to be allocated to the so-called Rapid Deployment Force could not meet a readiness test.	1
ClaimBuster	5802				I object to that part of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill which I think is very unfair and would prove to be so.	0
ClaimBuster	5803				Let me give you an example.	0
ClaimBuster	5804				So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women.	0
ClaimBuster	5805				Just because the president says it can't be done, that you'd lose China, doesn't mean it can't be done.	1
ClaimBuster	5806				Mr. Ford has said, I believe, that it was accurate, and that the White House made no attempt to block the issuing of that report.	1
ClaimBuster	5807				Uh - Mr. Brezhnev and I met in Vladivostok in December of 1974 for the purpose of trying to take the initial step so we could have a SALT II agreement that would go to l985.	1
ClaimBuster	5808				People who are working hard every day, paying payroll tax, gas taxes, but don't make enough income.	0
ClaimBuster	5809				What do we have to do?	0
ClaimBuster	5810				The government has a role.	0
ClaimBuster	5811				I think credibility is going to be very important in the future in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	5812				But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters.	0
ClaimBuster	5813				No, the way to win this is to be steadfast and resolved and to follow through on the plan that I've just outlined.	0
ClaimBuster	5814				We passed family and medical leave.	1
ClaimBuster	5815				We've got to try to have talks, understanding that we're not taking military options off the table.	0
ClaimBuster	5816				And I support the air launch cruise missile, the ground launch cruise missile, the Pershing missile, the Trident submarine, the D - 5 submarine, Stealth technology, the Midgetman -- we have a whole range of technology.	1
ClaimBuster	5817				Doesn't your policy really imply that we're going to have a fairly high rate of unemployment over a fairly long time, that growth is gonna be fairly slow, and that we're not gonna be able to do much - very much in the next four or five years to meet the basic agenda of our national needs in the cities, in health, uh in transit and a whole lot of things like that.	0
ClaimBuster	5818				I want to make sure the equipment for our military is the best it can possibly be, of course.	0
ClaimBuster	5819				So we need to preserve the system.	0
ClaimBuster	5820				But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	5821				But this is a global conflict that requires firm resolve.	0
ClaimBuster	5822				If drugs were legal, I don't think he'd be alive today.	0
ClaimBuster	5823				You just can't promise something like that just to get elected if you know there's a good chance that circumstances may overtake you.	0
ClaimBuster	5824				My opponent was against that.	1
ClaimBuster	5825				Or did they occur while you were a senior official in the federal government?	0
ClaimBuster	5826				We will succeed and we will bring our troops home with honor and victory and not in defeat.	0
ClaimBuster	5827				And both Governor Romney and I agree actually that we should lower our corporate tax rate.	1
ClaimBuster	5828				But I think strength must also require wisdom and smarts in its exercise.	0
ClaimBuster	5829				This Administration and this country last year had the lowest rate of economic growth - which means jobs - of any major industrialized society in the world in 1959.	1
ClaimBuster	5830				I will make sure that we invest in our country and our families.	0
ClaimBuster	5831				You would even be proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	5832				And -- and the -- and the president's statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	5833				Where we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers -- give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system.	0
ClaimBuster	5834				We need fundamental change in this country, and that's what I'd like to bring.	0
ClaimBuster	5835				I happen to think it's double that.	0
ClaimBuster	5836				If you make more -- if you make less than a quarter million dollars a year, then you will not see your income tax go up, your capital gains tax go up, your payroll tax.	1
ClaimBuster	5837				But now let's talk about the pluses that came out this week.	0
ClaimBuster	5838				And the question, is it worth the cost, reminds me of my own thinking when I came back from fighting in that war.	0
ClaimBuster	5839				But I will tell you, I've been all over.	0
ClaimBuster	5840				This administration seems to run that every morning.	0
ClaimBuster	5841				I think we can save money through this whole very sophisticated concept, Andrea, that I know you do understand of competitive strategies.	0
ClaimBuster	5842				Mr. President, have you looked at your pension?	0
ClaimBuster	5843				That means keep government out of it.	0
ClaimBuster	5844				And the Vice President cast the deciding vote against federal aid for teachers' salaries in the Senate, which prevented that being added.	1
ClaimBuster	5845				That's why we've had 24 retired generals and admirals, hundreds of business people, many of them Republican, support this campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	5846				We've expanded Pell Grants by a million students.	1
ClaimBuster	5847				I'm the president that stood up and said, don't mess with Social Security, and I'm not going to and we haven't and we are not going to go after the Social Security recipient.	1
ClaimBuster	5848				And if we have to get tough with Iran, believe me, we will get tough.	0
ClaimBuster	5849				would agree with us as well.	0
ClaimBuster	5850				You might say that took a lot of hard work.	0
ClaimBuster	5851				And they're very fine and very highly qualified.	0
ClaimBuster	5852				I was born in Detroit.	1
ClaimBuster	5853				But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it.	0
ClaimBuster	5854				That's not just going after places where there's abuse.	0
ClaimBuster	5855				Now, there are some other issues that have a bearing on how women succeed in the workplace.	0
ClaimBuster	5856				A lot of uh - very high quality, low-carbon coal, uh - low-sulfur coal is there, it's where our employment is needed.	1
ClaimBuster	5857				And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters.	1
ClaimBuster	5858				And I saw a problem in the public education system in America.	0
ClaimBuster	5859				I think they understand my commitment to helping them in the neighborhoods.	0
ClaimBuster	5860				As I understand it, we're building some 14 military bases there now, and some people say they've got a rather permanent concept to them.	1
ClaimBuster	5861				My dad was head of a car company.	1
ClaimBuster	5862				You can invest in a company, bankrupt it, lay off the workers, strip away their pensions, and you still make money.	0
ClaimBuster	5863				And that's the reason why I set up a trade task force to go after cheaters when it came to international trade.	1
ClaimBuster	5864				And I think that would be a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	5865				And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it.	0
ClaimBuster	5866				Now, we can do better.	0
ClaimBuster	5867				That's why I tried to be so specific in this campaign to have a mandate, if elected, so that Congress will know what the American people have voted for.	0
ClaimBuster	5868				I have a much better -- she spent -- let me tell you -- she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising -- you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names -- oh, temperament, let's go after -- I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament.	1
ClaimBuster	5869				I think what Mr. Arafat wants us to do is to make sure that everybody honors the agreements they've already made.	0
ClaimBuster	5870				Reduce the capital gains rate.	0
ClaimBuster	5871				And one of those dreams is justice.	0
ClaimBuster	5872				Now we've got all thousands and thousands of refugees.	1
ClaimBuster	5873				I will give middle-class Americans tax cuts, meaningful ones.	0
ClaimBuster	5874				Communism is the enemy of all religions; and we who do believe in God must join together.	0
ClaimBuster	5875				"He said, ""Sarah and I live on the east side of the mountain."	0
ClaimBuster	5876				In 1935, when the Social Security Act was written, ninety-four out of ninety-five Republicans voted against it.	1
ClaimBuster	5877				And to countries like Georgia and the Ukraine, I think we have to insist that they are free to join NATO if they meet the requirements, and they should have a membership action plan immediately to start bringing them in.	1
ClaimBuster	5878				We would have to close twenty military bases in the United States immediately.	1
ClaimBuster	5879				A lot of kids are expressing their concerns.	0
ClaimBuster	5880				But Government has never reduced Government does not tax to get the money it needs.	1
ClaimBuster	5881				I'm going to give the President some credit.	0
ClaimBuster	5882				Yes, I think it is.	0
ClaimBuster	5883				We have deregulated the air industry, the rail industry, the trucking industry, financial institutions.	1
ClaimBuster	5884				We have had some luck with Nigeria, but in Sierra Leon, and now that Nigeria has become a democracy, and we hope it stays that way, then maybe we can build on that.	1
ClaimBuster	5885				ery high, we might channel specific uh targeted job - job - uh opportunities by paying part of the salary of unemployed people - uh and also sharing with uh - local governments the uh - payment of salaries which would uh - let us cut down the unemployment rate much lower, before we hit the inflationary level.	0
ClaimBuster	5886				I'm also a former law enforcement officer.	1
ClaimBuster	5887				But while the President is negotiating with the Soviet Union, I simply do not want to make these unilateral cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	5888				And they are the innocent bystanders here in what is the biggest financial crisis and challenge of our time.	1
ClaimBuster	5889				Well, for 18 months he's been running on this tax plan.	1
ClaimBuster	5890				So I think it would be a good thing for America if it happened.	0
ClaimBuster	5891				But if they ever did overthrow Assad, you might end up with -- as bad as Assad is, and he's a bad guy, but you may very well end up with worse than Assad.	0
ClaimBuster	5892				But let's talk about what the Ford administration has done in the field of environment.	0
ClaimBuster	5893				If I have anything in politics, it's my word.	0
ClaimBuster	5894				I think you've seen tonight in this debate that Governor Reagan and I have agreed on exactly one thing - we are both against the reimposition of a peacetime draft.	1
ClaimBuster	5895				And, unfortunately, when -- when -- when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	5896				I get wound up because I feel strongly --	0
ClaimBuster	5897				You're going to have a lot of new members of Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	5898				And you'd think, well, then why lower the rates?	0
ClaimBuster	5899				And the choices we've made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	5900				For two years, the president didn't even engage with North Korea, did nothing at all, while it was growing more dangerous, despite the warnings of former Secretary of Defense William Perry, who negotiated getting television cameras and inspectors into that reactor.	1
ClaimBuster	5901				But Pakistan is important to the region, to the world and to us, because Pakistan has 100 nuclear warheads and they're rushing to build a lot more.	1
ClaimBuster	5902				That's one thing I learned by forging that tremendous and greatly--highly successful coalition against Saddam Hussein, the dictator.	0
ClaimBuster	5903				You walk down the street, you get shot.	1
ClaimBuster	5904				And the reason he didn't is, he said -- he wrote in his book -- because there was no viable exit strategy.	1
ClaimBuster	5905				So yes, I think it should be expanded.	0
ClaimBuster	5906				And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality.	0
ClaimBuster	5907				That's like the family of medical-leave law; it just tries to set the rules of the game.	0
ClaimBuster	5908				You don't get a hand gun, you don't get a rifle, you don't get a shot gun, you get zippo.	0
ClaimBuster	5909				You see, in order to get something done on behalf of the people, you have to put partisanship aside, and that's what we did in my state.	1
ClaimBuster	5910				And so a Pakistan that falls apart, becomes a failed state, would be of extraordinary danger to Afghanistan and to us.	0
ClaimBuster	5911				I disapprove of the issue.	0
ClaimBuster	5912				Ronald Reagan got together with Tip O'Neill and Howard Baker, two Republicans and one Democrat.	1
ClaimBuster	5913				But as far as strength derived from commitment to principles, as far as strength derived from the unity within our country, as far as strength derived from the people, the Congress, the secretary of state, the president, sharing in the evolution and carrying-out of a foreign policy, as far as strength derived from the respect of our own allies and friends, their assurance that we will be staunch in our commitment, that we will not deviate and that we'll give them adequate attention, as far as - as strength derived from doing what's right - caring for the poor, providing food, becoming the breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world - in those respects, we're not strong.	0
ClaimBuster	5914				I have sustained it since then.	1
ClaimBuster	5915				Talking about this and this.	0
ClaimBuster	5916				You can't have 23 million people struggling to get a job.	0
ClaimBuster	5917				Some of it's said in entertainment.	0
ClaimBuster	5918				And we want a democracy in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	5919				And as we pursue the enemy wherever it exists, we'll also spread freedom and liberty.	0
ClaimBuster	5920				We were closing loopholes, we were going after big corporations.	1
ClaimBuster	5921				Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York.	1
ClaimBuster	5922				I supported giving parents a V-chip on their television so if they don't want their young kids to watch things they shouldn't watch, they wouldn't have to.	1
ClaimBuster	5923				The inclination that Governor Reagan has exemplified in many troubled times since he has been running for President - I think since 1968 - to inject American military forces in places like North Korea, to put a blockade around Cuba this year, or in some instances, to project American forces into a fishing dispute against the small nation of Ecuador on the west coast of South America.	1
ClaimBuster	5924				It had nothing to do with the debate on Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	5925				Think of this as their country.	0
ClaimBuster	5926				He gets the first --	0
ClaimBuster	5927				There's only 25 percent of the people in there.	1
ClaimBuster	5928				What we have to do is simply to make some adjustments to take account of the fact that the baby boomers, people like me, are bigger in number than the people that went just before us and the people that come just after us.	0
ClaimBuster	5929				Everybody cares if people aren't doing well.	0
ClaimBuster	5930				That's what happened in Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	5931				"And consequently, I don't think it's enough to go before Republican audiences - and I never do - and say, ""Look, vote for me because I'm a Republican."""	0
ClaimBuster	5932				101 in leadership is be accountable for what you do.	0
ClaimBuster	5933				The people of Serbia have acted very bravely in kicking this guy out of office.	0
ClaimBuster	5934				We're not doing as well amongst the people that get to be habitual drug-users.	0
ClaimBuster	5935				I support the President's position.	0
ClaimBuster	5936				Because even though we have maintained, as I pointed out in our first debate, the absolute gap over the Soviet Union; even though the growth in this Administration has been twice as much as it was in the Truman Administration; that isn't good enough.	1
ClaimBuster	5937				His some of his college presidents aren't exactly holier than thou.	0
ClaimBuster	5938				Now, if you're a business person, and you can locate any place in the world, then, obviously, if you go to the country where it's 11 percent tax versus 35 percent, you're going to be able to create jobs, increase your business, make more investment, et cetera.	0
ClaimBuster	5939				And I'll do a good job, because I am committed.	0
ClaimBuster	5940				And that's not the facts.	0
ClaimBuster	5941				We could be providing logistical support, setting up a no-fly zone at relatively little cost to us, but we can only do it if we can help mobilize the international community and lead.	0
ClaimBuster	5942				I personally don't think that's the right kind of future for America, and I think we ought to take a different tack.	0
ClaimBuster	5943				We've had a lot of other presidents who didn't wear their country's uniform who had to order our young soldiers into battle, including President Wilson and President Roosevelt.	1
ClaimBuster	5944				She said, reading is the new civil right.	1
ClaimBuster	5945				The main issue is whether or not the Roe v. Wade decision is going to be overturned.	0
ClaimBuster	5946				We have to find ways to reestablish it in foreign policy and national security policy.	0
ClaimBuster	5947				We are serving a million more families now.	1
ClaimBuster	5948				And I'm afraid that's what I think I'm hearing from Governor Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	5949				And as a result, our universities are now more diverse.	1
ClaimBuster	5950				If the laws are violated so much, but to suggest if somebody represents a foreign country on anything, that makes him corrupt or against the taxpayer, I don't agree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	5951				And the president said never, never, never would he raise taxes in New Jersey, and within a day Marlin Fitzwater, his spokesman, said now, that's not a promise.	1
ClaimBuster	5952				We've sort of distanced ourselves from our ally, South Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	5953				It is believed that probably 70% of the potential oil in the United States is probably hidden in those lands, and no one is allowed to even go and explore to find out if it is there.	1
ClaimBuster	5954				How do you do that?	0
ClaimBuster	5955				Under the present administration - Nixon's and Ford's - we've had three times the inflation rate that we experienced under President Johnson and President Kennedy.	1
ClaimBuster	5956				This isn't the beginning of the end of this crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	5957				Let the states and localities do that.	0
ClaimBuster	5958				And when we had Osama bin Laden cornered in the mountains of Tora Bora, 1,000 of his cohorts with him in those mountains.	1
ClaimBuster	5959				It had nothing to do with us.	1
ClaimBuster	5960				Well, as I've indicated, I think that it has a significant role to play.	0
ClaimBuster	5961				Look, this is the year -- this is in the aftermath of Columbine, and Paducah, and all the places in our country where the nation has been shocked by these weapons in the hands of the wrong people.	0
ClaimBuster	5962				And that is to get the support of the people.	0
ClaimBuster	5963				Secondly, I've said that I will not support the cuts in Social Security and Medicare and the rest that the President has proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	5964				It just shows a significant difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	5965				I don't believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding who's going to play tennis on the White House court.	0
ClaimBuster	5966				Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent.	1
ClaimBuster	5967				I was down in Texas taking care of business, tending to my family.	1
ClaimBuster	5968				They were not within the treaty area when the treaty was passed in fifty-five.	1
ClaimBuster	5969				I think the governor may not have heard what I said clearly.	0
ClaimBuster	5970				Now we cannot allow a second Holocaust.	0
ClaimBuster	5971				Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle.	1
ClaimBuster	5972				I don't know -- starting after 4 years.	0
ClaimBuster	5973				I see that as part of my job as president, and I'll make my best effort to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	5974				"The way my opponent talks, he said, ""We're going to spend the government's money."	1
ClaimBuster	5975				And that fact is just not right.	1
ClaimBuster	5976				I promised a new beginning.	0
ClaimBuster	5977				I would pass a hate crimes law, as I said, and I guess I had misunderstood the governor's previous position.	1
ClaimBuster	5978				That's what took us from surplus to deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	5979				Maybe we will have another debate on the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	5980				They're back away from a nuclear proliferation treaty that we had with them.	1
ClaimBuster	5981				When Harry Truman was president he was not afraid to have a strong secretary of defense.	0
ClaimBuster	5982				Most recently out in Aurora.	0
ClaimBuster	5983				And thanks to UNLV for hosting us.	0
ClaimBuster	5984				You've got a back-door draft right now.	0
ClaimBuster	5985				Well, that sounds very good, but it's very wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	5986				I think the basic difference is, and I have had some experience in this, I think the basic difference, I trust the people.	0
ClaimBuster	5987				You're for school uniforms and curfews and you're opposed to truancy.	0
ClaimBuster	5988				And we've got to give some trust and confidence back to America.	0
ClaimBuster	5989				I think you have to have a system of primary and preventive clinics in our inner cities and our rural areas so people can have access to health care.	0
ClaimBuster	5990				We see the Russians coming out of Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	5991				Now, let's look at priorities.	0
ClaimBuster	5992				I go into this race as their servant, and I belong to them.	0
ClaimBuster	5993				I -- I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals.	0
ClaimBuster	5994				It would go into the Social Security Trust Fund.	1
ClaimBuster	5995				She didn't answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens...	1
ClaimBuster	5996				But if you don't have the guts to control costs by changing the insurance system and taking on the bureaucracies and the regulation of health care in the private and public sector, you can't fix this problem.	0
ClaimBuster	5997				I want the line-item veto.	0
ClaimBuster	5998				And I would hope that one of the things I could do as president is to recognize them, to give them the kind of recognition that they need and deserve so that more and more young people can themselves become the heroes of tomorrow, can go into public service, can go into teaching, can go into drug counseling, can go into law enforcement, and be heroes themselves to generations yet to come.	0
ClaimBuster	5999				You could have done it, if you were an effective -- if you were an effective senator, you could have done it.	0
ClaimBuster	6000				We're low spending, low tax burden.	1
ClaimBuster	6001				I think the American people should take into account who we are as individuals, what our experience is, what our positions are on the issues and proposals are.	0
ClaimBuster	6002				We have a fundamental difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	6003				Let me just say to you, number one, don't throw the labels around.	0
ClaimBuster	6004				Let me tell you that I, first of all, oppose an election year tax cut, whether it is the 10% across-the-board tax cut promised to the taxpayers by my opponent in this debate tonight, or whether it is the $27.5 billion tax cut promised on the 20th of August by President Carter.	1
ClaimBuster	6005				There are 7 trillion dollars in assets locked up in America.	1
ClaimBuster	6006				So the question is, would you buy a used election promise from my opponent.	0
ClaimBuster	6007				It's the US that's taken the lead in humanitarian aid into Bosnia.	1
ClaimBuster	6008				We've got a great economic package which I hope we will discuss later.	0
ClaimBuster	6009				One thing I've noted as I've traveled around the country are the tremendous number of children who come out to see the presidential candidates.	1
ClaimBuster	6010				"It was a - a tremendous surge of patriotism, that ""I want to make a sacrifice for my country."""	0
ClaimBuster	6011				We've shipped millions of jobs overseas and we have a strange situation because we have a process in Washington where after you've served for a while you cash in, become a foreign lobbyist, make $30,000 a month, then take a leave, work on presidential campaigns, make sure you've got good contacts and then go back out.	1
ClaimBuster	6012				We have to work much more closely with the Pakistanis.	0
ClaimBuster	6013				So I hope and expect that I will be liked by the people of this country as president of the United States; I certainly hope I will be liked by them on the 8th of November.	0
ClaimBuster	6014				It was lies, and it was fiction.	0
ClaimBuster	6015				Can we start the clock over?	0
ClaimBuster	6016				It's a part of the Social Security system.	1
ClaimBuster	6017				I don't have time to tell you the stories.	0
ClaimBuster	6018				Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	6019				Look what happened to her.	0
ClaimBuster	6020				About a year ago he cut the Pentagon budget six point eight billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	6021				You've got to look at our records.	0
ClaimBuster	6022				And we can do it, too.	0
ClaimBuster	6023				I'm addressing him all evening as Mr. President.	1
ClaimBuster	6024				And there's no market forces involved with health care.	1
ClaimBuster	6025				Well, Mr. Ford is - is uh changing uh considerably his previous philosophy.	1
ClaimBuster	6026				So I consider that a compliment.	0
ClaimBuster	6027				I did think we ought to extend the assault weapons ban, and was told the fact that the bill was never going to move, because Republicans and Democrats were against the assault weapon ban, people of both parties.	1
ClaimBuster	6028				Its not the amount of time you spend in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	6029				And my word is good.	0
ClaimBuster	6030				They're not left or right.	0
ClaimBuster	6031				We have been moving much faster than we did in the Truman years.	0
ClaimBuster	6032				√É‚Äö But I do have a lot of experience in getting things done.	0
ClaimBuster	6033				Our people wanna go back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	6034				All of these are programs that Senator Dole opposed that I supported, because I felt they were a legitimate effort to help people make the most of their own lives.	1
ClaimBuster	6035				And John has just made up some very interesting figures.	0
ClaimBuster	6036				My message to the troops is also: Thank you for what they're doing, but it's also help is on the way.	0
ClaimBuster	6037				We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding.	0
ClaimBuster	6038				When I have sent the fleet into the Taiwan straits.	0
ClaimBuster	6039				In businesses that can create the new energy economy of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	6040				We need to get the economy going.	0
ClaimBuster	6041				In the budget that I submitted to the Congress in January this year, I re- recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending.	1
ClaimBuster	6042				It is a serious problem, but I don't see it as the kind of terrible, terrible problem that the S&L problem was.	0
ClaimBuster	6043				After 9/11, we had to look at the world differently.	0
ClaimBuster	6044				Choose your doctor, choose your plan.	0
ClaimBuster	6045				The auto industry has come roaring back.	0
ClaimBuster	6046				When Senator Dole made that remark about all the elitists, all the young elitists in the administration, one of the young men who works for me who grew up in a house trailer looked at me and said, Mr. President, I know how you grew up, who is he talking about.	1
ClaimBuster	6047				We're going to have a strong border.	0
ClaimBuster	6048				And we all have ideas out there, and Mr. Bush has a record.	0
ClaimBuster	6049				I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	6050				Well, I think Senator McCain's absolutely right that we need more responsibility, but we need it not just when there's a crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	6051				It means that there will be increased employment.	0
ClaimBuster	6052				I decided the right action was in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	6053				And the President, Mr. Mondale, has called you whining and vacillating, among the more charitable phrases -- weak, I believe.	1
ClaimBuster	6054				In the first century of our nation's history our forefathers gave us the finest form of government in the history of mankind.	0
ClaimBuster	6055				The answer is very straightforward.	0
ClaimBuster	6056				If I say no, it ignores their behavior.	0
ClaimBuster	6057				More in July than June.	1
ClaimBuster	6058				So let me get this right.	0
ClaimBuster	6059				I am going to protect the American taxpayer against the spend and tax Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	6060				That's the one who is being aborted.	0
ClaimBuster	6061				People -- the 18- to 24-year-old high school graduates 10 years ago were making more than they are now.	1
ClaimBuster	6062				And when it gets overextended, morale drops.	0
ClaimBuster	6063				Not all wisdom is in Washington, D.C. on this issue.	0
ClaimBuster	6064				They seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the Truman Administration which preceded it.	1
ClaimBuster	6065				In other words, the next president, as he leads America and the free world, can be only as great as the American people are great.	0
ClaimBuster	6066				And this area on the border has not been governed since the days of Alexander the Great.	1
ClaimBuster	6067				But we have 2,478 specific recommendations from a commission of more than 2,000 business people in this country, through the Grace commission, that we're studying right now -- and we've already implemented 17 percent of them -- that are recommendations as to how to make government more efficient, more economic.	1
ClaimBuster	6068				Plus, I want them all voting for me.	0
ClaimBuster	6069				and the military that liked it better the way it used to be.	0
ClaimBuster	6070				I can give you hundreds of -- you can probably give me 200 cases where one vote made a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	6071				And if we have an across-the-board spending freeze, we're not going to be able to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	6072				And since that action, terrorist action against the United States citizens have gone down.	1
ClaimBuster	6073				But I also want to say to seniors, if you're happy with Medicare the way it is, fine, you can stay in the program.	0
ClaimBuster	6074				And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I'm so fortunate enough to become your president.	0
ClaimBuster	6075				That's the problem with our system.	0
ClaimBuster	6076				Quotas tend to pit one group of people against another.	0
ClaimBuster	6077				You see, I have a fundamental difference.	0
ClaimBuster	6078				That is the same Government that, in 1920, told us we only had enough oil left for 13 years, and 19 years later, told us we only had enough left for another 15 years.	1
ClaimBuster	6079				An African American was my chief cabinet officer.	1
ClaimBuster	6080				And my point has been, as opposed to politicizing an issue like Medicare, in other words, holding it up as an issue, hoping somebody bites it and try to clobber them over the head with it for political purposes, this year, in the year 2000, it's time to get it done once and for all.	0
ClaimBuster	6081				I know how to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	6082				First of all, I won't repeat the mistake that I regret enormously, and that is, after we were able to help the Afghan freedom fighters and drive the Russians out of Afghanistan, we basically washed our hands of the region.	1
ClaimBuster	6083				But we're going to have to invest in the American people again, in tax cuts for the middle class, in health care for all Americans, and college for every young person who wants to go.	0
ClaimBuster	6084				That wasn't the kind of call to service that I think the American people were looking for.	0
ClaimBuster	6085				It's the very few that create most of the crises, and we just have to find them and deal with them.	0
ClaimBuster	6086				Where I've been critical of the Administration's policy, and where I criticized Mr. Nixon, was because in his press conference in Havana in 1955, he praised the competence and stability of the bicta- bict- Batista dictatorship - that dictatorship had killed over twenty thousand Cubans in seven years.	1
ClaimBuster	6087				But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do.	1
ClaimBuster	6088				They retired General Shinseki for telling him that.	1
ClaimBuster	6089				We may not find that many this evening, so I wanted to emphasize.	0
ClaimBuster	6090				We are not dependent upon the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	6091				The President inherited a good economy, sure the S&L crisis then were selling assets.	1
ClaimBuster	6092				We're going to speed up the process, big league, because it's very inefficient.	0
ClaimBuster	6093				I've gotten to know so many -- I've developed so many friends over the last year.	0
ClaimBuster	6094				I'm interested in 240 million citizens in this country who share in the American dream, all of them in every part of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	6095				You can't stand there, Governor Clinton, and say, well, I think I'd have been -- I have supported the minority, let sanctions work or wish it would go away -- but I would have voted with the majority.	0
ClaimBuster	6096				In regard to the exchange of students and labor unions, I am chairman of the subcommittee on Africa and I think that one of the most unfortunate phases of our policy towards that country was the very minute number of exchanges that we had.	1
ClaimBuster	6097				They want us to talk about the problems of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	6098				I believe I offer tested, strong leadership that can calm the waters of the troubled world.	0
ClaimBuster	6099				... in many cases, ISIS-aligned, and we now have them in our country, and wait until you see -- this is going to be the great Trojan horse.	1
ClaimBuster	6100				She's done a terrible job for the African-Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	6101				The president can modify the uh - economic structure of a country by public statements and general attitudes in the budget that he proposes.	0
ClaimBuster	6102				She doesn't even know who the rebels are.	1
ClaimBuster	6103				They jumped on me yesterday for being a little optimistic about the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	6104				I'm appalled at the highest outrageous numbers of divorces -- it happens in families, it's happened in ours.	0
ClaimBuster	6105				Yes, I understand what it means to the commander in chief.	0
ClaimBuster	6106				The HMOs and the insurance companies support the other bill that's pending, the one that the Republican majority has put forward.	1
ClaimBuster	6107				I would simply say to her, look, take a look at what the president has proposed on job retraining.	0
ClaimBuster	6108				Governor Bush is in favor of vouchers which take taxpayer money away from public schools and give them to private schools that are not accountable for how the money is used and don't have to take all applicants.	1
ClaimBuster	6109				We have seen Afghanistan worsen, deteriorate.	1
ClaimBuster	6110				These kinds of things uh - ought to be done, uh they ought to be encouraged and supported, and even required uh by the government, yes.	0
ClaimBuster	6111				The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks.	0
ClaimBuster	6112				I oppose supply management and production controls.	0
ClaimBuster	6113				And we haven't done a very good job of that at the federal level recently.	0
ClaimBuster	6114				... where they're not paying us what we need.	0
ClaimBuster	6115				Other senators, other congressmen choose other programs.	0
ClaimBuster	6116				They would have won an appeal.	0
ClaimBuster	6117				I propose to spend 1.6 trillion dollars on defense between now and the year 2002 and there's less than 1 percent difference between my budget and the Republican budget on defense.	1
ClaimBuster	6118				Now, should people pay more for Medicare if they can?	0
ClaimBuster	6119				They've got sneak-and-peek searches that are allowed.	1
ClaimBuster	6120				I think we have to be very reticent about that.	0
ClaimBuster	6121				And he opposed even President Carter, when toward the end of his term President Carter wanted to increase the defense budget.	1
ClaimBuster	6122				I'd better correct the President.	0
ClaimBuster	6123				That's part -- that's part one.	0
ClaimBuster	6124				But what I think the American people recognize is after a decade of war it's time to do some nation building here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	6125				That will help reinforce the values that parents teach at home as well.	0
ClaimBuster	6126				Also, I want to thank the people of Cleveland and Ohio for being such hospitable hosts during these last few hours in my life.	0
ClaimBuster	6127				I know what our needs are.	0
ClaimBuster	6128				And all these things have contributed to us lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels in 16 years.	1
ClaimBuster	6129				I don't think that our record of human rights can be assailed.	0
ClaimBuster	6130				We're one of the first states that said you can sue an HMO for denying you proper coverage.	1
ClaimBuster	6131				Secondly, I think the question is uh - what are the programs that we advocate, what is the party record that we lead?	0
ClaimBuster	6132				And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people.	0
ClaimBuster	6133				I - I think it's accurate to say that Mr. Ford's position on gun control has changed.	1
ClaimBuster	6134				The people who have jobs and educations and opportunities that didn't have them 10 years ago don't think it's irrelevant at all; they think it's highly relevant and they wish the rest of the country had them.	0
ClaimBuster	6135				And I would do everything I could in my power to bring that about.	0
ClaimBuster	6136				What that means is that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade.	0
ClaimBuster	6137				And I said, let's fix this system.	0
ClaimBuster	6138				I made a proposal three months ago on this.	1
ClaimBuster	6139				That's another story that we're going to pay a big price for right after the election.	0
ClaimBuster	6140				Now this agenda should delineate those issues on which there is a possibility of some agreement or negotiation.	0
ClaimBuster	6141				We have an arms race underway instead.	0
ClaimBuster	6142				Very serious mistakes in judgment were made.	0
ClaimBuster	6143				It's going to have to be employed in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	6144				And it would be a tax paid by the consumers, and then we're asked to believe that some way, they would get this back to the consumers.	0
ClaimBuster	6145				You know, if they asked me to be part of some monitoring force -- as we are in the Sinai and have been since 1978 -- to monitor the peace between Egypt and Israel, frankly, I would have to think about it.	0
ClaimBuster	6146				I don't mind those enterprise zones; let's try them, but not as a substitute for the others.	0
ClaimBuster	6147				And it fits with his philosophy.	0
ClaimBuster	6148				So what would I have done?	0
ClaimBuster	6149				I trust women to make the decisions that affect their lives, their destinies and their bodies.	1
ClaimBuster	6150				The charter of the United Nations - its Preamble, Article I and Article II - also provide that there shall be no intervention by one nation in the internal affairs of another.	1
ClaimBuster	6151				We don't talk about it.	0
ClaimBuster	6152				Thirty-five to forty countries in the world had a greater capability of making weapons at the moment the president invaded than Saddam Hussein.	1
ClaimBuster	6153				Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation.	0
ClaimBuster	6154				But what I would do is appoint people to the Federal Bench that will not legislate from the Bench, who will interpret the Constitution.	0
ClaimBuster	6155				If you don't have trust in that, I do.	0
ClaimBuster	6156				They're the best -- they're most -- have best -- we're the best exporters.	0
ClaimBuster	6157				The president moved the troops, so he's got 10 times the number of troops in Iraq than he has in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is.	1
ClaimBuster	6158				As a matter of fact, I would like to take the issue a little further.	0
ClaimBuster	6159				I don't think the answer is to slow the economy down more, drive unemployment up more and undermine the health of the private sector.	0
ClaimBuster	6160				Because there's a huge pool, we can drop the costs.	0
ClaimBuster	6161				And for the most part I agree with Senator McCain on many of the steps that have to be taken.	0
ClaimBuster	6162				We have always been willing to go the extra mile to negotiate for disarmament or in any other area.	1
ClaimBuster	6163				Well, I-we obviously have a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	6164				Thank you very much, Jim, and I'll begin by answering your questions -- your last question.	0
ClaimBuster	6165				I mean, you know, it's tough to ask a teacher who's making $30,000 or $35,000 a year to tighten her belt when people who are making much more than her are living pretty high on the hog.	0
ClaimBuster	6166				We've got to do it now.	0
ClaimBuster	6167				Mr. Nixon has been part of that Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	6168				Right now our military is the strongest in the entire history of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	6169				It's a moral responsibility for us and the world.	0
ClaimBuster	6170				We simply cannot pull back.	0
ClaimBuster	6171				And if we are only thinking about tomorrow or the next day and not thinking about 10 years from now, we're not going to control our own economic future.	0
ClaimBuster	6172				Go back to Jimmy Carter, and interest rates were 21%, inflation was 15%.	1
ClaimBuster	6173				It includes telling the oil companies, that currently have 68 million acres that they're not using, that either you use them or you lose them.	1
ClaimBuster	6174				He endorses the Democratic uh - platform which, as I read it, calls for approximately sixty additional programs.	1
ClaimBuster	6175				I'm not exactly sure how you enhance the penalty any more than the death penalty.	0
ClaimBuster	6176				I'm not going to be the kind of president that says you get tax relief and you don't.	0
ClaimBuster	6177				We started from the day we got into office.	1
ClaimBuster	6178				I ask the American people to join me in this partnership.	0
ClaimBuster	6179				We have enormous trade imbalance with China, and it's worse this year than last year, and it's worse last year than the year before.	1
ClaimBuster	6180				And here is the simple difference.	0
ClaimBuster	6181				The first President out of thirty-eight that ever resigned from public office under pressure.	1
ClaimBuster	6182				He has one-third as much chance to get through college as a white student.	1
ClaimBuster	6183				We need to have a very effective leadership effort in Syria, making sure that the -- the insurgent there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed, are people who will be the responsible parties.	0
ClaimBuster	6184				We want freedom to gain.	0
ClaimBuster	6185				We're first in other areas of science but in space, which is the new science, we're not first.	1
ClaimBuster	6186				I've never heard Governor Clinton make a mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	6187				And I think that's the way it ought to be.	0
ClaimBuster	6188				You ought to put it in prudent, safe investments so that $1 trillion over the next ten years grows to be $3 trillion.	0
ClaimBuster	6189				The same old experience is not relevant.	0
ClaimBuster	6190				When the president took office, the price of gasoline here in Nassau County was about $1.86 a gallon.	1
ClaimBuster	6191				I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system.	0
ClaimBuster	6192				Now, I understand what the governor has said about asking the Russians to be involved, and under some circumstances that might be a good idea.	0
ClaimBuster	6193				And this is one of the reasons why one of the first -- the first bill I signed was something called the Lily Ledbetter bill.	1
ClaimBuster	6194				Number two, investigate exactly what happened, regardless of where the facts lead us, to make sure folks are held accountable and it doesn't happen again.	0
ClaimBuster	6195				The same thing will be done uh - at the federal government level.	0
ClaimBuster	6196				But that's not the point here.	0
ClaimBuster	6197				My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald's, assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it.	0
ClaimBuster	6198				On the question of the development of natural resources, I would pay as you go in the sense that they would be balanced and the power revenues would bring back sufficient money to finance the projects, in the same way as the Tennessee Valley.	0
ClaimBuster	6199				This is a fair plan.	0
ClaimBuster	6200				The most recent has been the one in Brighton.	1
ClaimBuster	6201				"I talked to a man just briefly there who asked me one simple question: ""Do I have reason to hope that I can someday take care of my family again?"	1
ClaimBuster	6202				You talk about eight years?	0
ClaimBuster	6203				We have to make sure that we make it easier for kids to afford college.	0
ClaimBuster	6204				I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.	0
ClaimBuster	6205				That's a 30 percent reduction in the portion that the federal government contributes to education in just eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	6206				He shouldn't have made that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	6207				Perhaps Mrs. Truman can, but I don't think I can.	0
ClaimBuster	6208				We have been successful in Portugal, where a year ago it looked like there was a very great possibility that the uh - Communists would take over in Portugal.	1
ClaimBuster	6209				"And, yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, and -- just like we went after bin Laden, while you were doing ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" and we brought him to justice."	1
ClaimBuster	6210				You couldn't have people opening up banks in their -- in their garage and making loans.	0
ClaimBuster	6211				Social Security was due to go bankrupt before 1983.	1
ClaimBuster	6212				He saw the wisdom -- until the Democrat primary came along and Howard Dean, the anti-war candidate, began to gain on him, and he changed positions.	1
ClaimBuster	6213				We're expanding veterans' health care throughout the country.	1
ClaimBuster	6214				And the Republicans in recent years - not only in the last twenty-five years, but in the last eight years - have opposed housing, opposed care for the aged, opposed federal aid to education, opposed minimum wage and I think that record tells something.	1
ClaimBuster	6215				Every day is earth day if you own the land.	0
ClaimBuster	6216				And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.	1
ClaimBuster	6217				We need a lot of things.	0
ClaimBuster	6218				But it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it.	0
ClaimBuster	6219				Under the windfall profits tax, we expect to spend about $43 billion in the next 10 years to rebuild the transportation systems of our country.	1
ClaimBuster	6220				I think I should also add that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, if he intends to carry out his platform - the one adopted in Los Angeles - it is just impossible for him to make good on those promises without raising taxes or without having a rise in t- prices or both.	0
ClaimBuster	6221				But you know, one of the real catalysts, really the match that lit this fire was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.	0
ClaimBuster	6222				Now, it's not the most efficient way to get people health care.	0
ClaimBuster	6223				And I was reminded of what that would mean if those were my kids.	0
ClaimBuster	6224				I was an altar boy.	1
ClaimBuster	6225				It's to make health care affordable and available this way.	0
ClaimBuster	6226				So we have to use our great people.	0
ClaimBuster	6227				Her donors took massive tax write-offs.	1
ClaimBuster	6228				When it comes to Social Security, as I said, you don't need a major structural change in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	6229				I know we can do better.	0
ClaimBuster	6230				And I'd love to be out of workers and have to import them, like some of our international competitors.	0
ClaimBuster	6231				I completely sustained the treaty.	1
ClaimBuster	6232				We ought to have rural enterprise zones.	0
ClaimBuster	6233				So they want the economy to work and the world to be free and open.	0
ClaimBuster	6234				And the fact that you're making an investment in higher education is critical.	1
ClaimBuster	6235				Now, just a few days ago a bipartisan commission of Republicans and Democrats -- more Republicans than Democrats -- said my plan will save the average family $1200 a year more than the Bush plan will by the year 2000, $2.2 trillion in the next 12 years, $400 billion a year by the end of this decade.	1
ClaimBuster	6236				But I think we've got to be very careful in balancing the ethics and the science.	0
ClaimBuster	6237				And, you know, I appreciate and it appears we've got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	6238				If we can get it done in the first year, you bet.	0
ClaimBuster	6239				Earlier this year, in the first quarter, we did have a very severe inflation pressure brought about by the OPEC price increase.	1
ClaimBuster	6240				Let's talk about civil rights.	0
ClaimBuster	6241				"Pick that person in November because believe me, as I've said before, ""The party's over and it's time for the clean-up crew."""	1
ClaimBuster	6242				We need a heritage trust program, similar to the one we had in Georgia, to set aside additional lands that have uh - geological and archeological importance, uh natural areas for enjoyment.	0
ClaimBuster	6243				I've picked a lot of people.	1
ClaimBuster	6244				And you can have the right kind of experience and the wrong kind of experience.	0
ClaimBuster	6245				I supported what we did in Kosovo.	1
ClaimBuster	6246				I consider myself in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of Presidents who served before me.	0
ClaimBuster	6247				And contrary to what the President says, I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful.	0
ClaimBuster	6248				We're ahead of all of the Western European country.	1
ClaimBuster	6249				But because I still believe that there is some discrimination and that not everybody has an opportunity to prove they're qualified, I favor the right kind of Affirmative Action.	0
ClaimBuster	6250				That's why I don't think we should give nearly half of it to the wealthiest 1%, because the other 99% have had an awful lot to do with building the surplus in our prosperity.	1
ClaimBuster	6251				George, Boston Harbor was polluted for 100 years.	1
ClaimBuster	6252				That's why I think it's important for us to get loan guarantees to the automakers, but we do have to hold them responsible as well to start producing the highly fuel-efficient cars of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	6253				That's not a grand coalition.	0
ClaimBuster	6254				That before we go into the summit, before we ever meet again, I think it's important that the United States build its strength; that it build its military strength as well as its own economic strength.	0
ClaimBuster	6255				But understand that there's a lot of cruelty around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	6256				And what I now want to do is to hire more teachers, especially in math and science, because we know that we've fallen behind when it comes to math and science.	0
ClaimBuster	6257				Let me mention something else the president said.	0
ClaimBuster	6258				We have 543 at present.	1
ClaimBuster	6259				And it is going to be operating at surpluses and I don't want the liberal Democratic Congress to spend out of that Social Security Trust Fund or go and take the money out for some other purpose.	0
ClaimBuster	6260				We have 100,000 to 200,000 embryos that are frozen in nitrogen today from fertility clinics.	1
ClaimBuster	6261				We're going to grow the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	6262				I believe that we have to do these things with a government that's smaller and less bureaucratic, but that we have to do them nonetheless.	0
ClaimBuster	6263				It's when you try to use that to undermine the integrity of private political -- or private religious faith and the use of the state is where -- for the most personal decisions in American life -- that's where I draw the line.	0
ClaimBuster	6264				It was the only one in the nation that furloughed murderers who had not served enough time to be eligible for parole.	1
ClaimBuster	6265				And that's why I've supported building up our capacity.	1
ClaimBuster	6266				If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if we're moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	6267				It's gotten a little nasty.	0
ClaimBuster	6268				In addition to that we've become fearful to compete with the Soviet Union on an equal basis.	0
ClaimBuster	6269				And let me just say that budget that you passed that I vetoed would have cut 50,000 kids out of Headstart.	1
ClaimBuster	6270				But that, too, will require some choices.	0
ClaimBuster	6271				We've cut it in half.	1
ClaimBuster	6272				That's what we ought to do at the federal level when it comes to grandfathered plants for utilities.	0
ClaimBuster	6273				He says he wants to give the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country a five-year $40 billion tax break, and we're going to pay for it.	1
ClaimBuster	6274				That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.	0
ClaimBuster	6275				If you have health insurance, then you don't have to do anything.	0
ClaimBuster	6276				President Reagan said no, peace through strength.	1
ClaimBuster	6277				I assume she was supportive of the decision on McDonnell Douglas, I assume she was supporting me on the decision to sell those airplanes.	0
ClaimBuster	6278				Is the person guilty of the crime?	0
ClaimBuster	6279				So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making sure that middle-class families are secure in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	6280				And if Americans trust me with the presidency, I can pledge to you, we will have the most significant effort, openly -- not secret meetings in the White House with special interests, not ideologically driven efforts to push people aside -- but a genuine effort to try to restore America's hope and possibilities by bringing people together.	0
ClaimBuster	6281				That is the best way.	0
ClaimBuster	6282				And they said no because they got a memo from one of their political advisers saying that instead they should characterize whatever we did as big government and make sure nothing was done to aid healthcare before the '94 elections so they could make that claim.	0
ClaimBuster	6283				The president's path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay.	1
ClaimBuster	6284				This is not just a women's issue, this is a family issue, this is a middle-class issue, and that's why we've got to fight for it.	0
ClaimBuster	6285				Every single country in Latin America, Central America and the Caribbean is a democracy tonight but Cuba.	1
ClaimBuster	6286				Yes, we have fundamental differences.	0
ClaimBuster	6287				I'm not going to go around the country saying he didn't tell the truth, when he looked at the same intelligence I did.	0
ClaimBuster	6288				He feels that we're moving ahead uh - in a - we're not going into a recession in this country, economically; he feels that our power and prestige is stronger than it ever was relative to that of the Communists, that we're moving ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	6289				We've had 12 years of trickle down economics.	1
ClaimBuster	6290				And we're going to make sure people get punished for the crime.	0
ClaimBuster	6291				That's the problem with it.	0
ClaimBuster	6292				The worst thing is, again, it's a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	6293				On the international financial crises that come up, my friend, Bob Rubin, the former Secretary of Treasury is here, he's a close advisor to me and great friend in all respects.	1
ClaimBuster	6294				I said that we would provide guarantees, and -- and that was what was able to allow these companies to go through bankruptcy, to come out of bankruptcy.	1
ClaimBuster	6295				I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey.	0
ClaimBuster	6296				We have them all day every day.	0
ClaimBuster	6297				I sat there watching ad after ad after ad, false ad.	0
ClaimBuster	6298				You know, the President said he was going to cut defense $60 billion, he cut defense $112 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	6299				The average uh American person can't do it.	0
ClaimBuster	6300				Because it's God's will, whatever happens.	0
ClaimBuster	6301				But I do think that you need to make an appeal every time you can to eliminate racial divisions and discrimination, and I'll keep on doing that and pointing to some legislative accomplishment to back it up.	0
ClaimBuster	6302				How's it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college?	0
ClaimBuster	6303				It looks like a bombed-out city - great, gaunt skeletons of buildings.	0
ClaimBuster	6304				I think you can work on all three at once, Tom.	0
ClaimBuster	6305				The fact is that the president had an opportunity to stand up and take on China for currency manipulation.	1
ClaimBuster	6306				But there is no doubt that we've been living beyond our means and we're going to have to make some adjustments.	0
ClaimBuster	6307				They are a new weapons system that has a great potential, both conventional and nuclear armed.	1
ClaimBuster	6308				If we could get agreement on that, maybe they could pass that in the final days of this Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	6309				That's not specific in terms of a program.	0
ClaimBuster	6310				... people, right, not for current retirees.	0
ClaimBuster	6311				And so I don't think that you make an exception based on medical knowledge at the time.	0
ClaimBuster	6312				I'm not un-proud of it, to be honest with you.	0
ClaimBuster	6313				I think they may be using the man's own words.	0
ClaimBuster	6314				So, there are a host of other figures that reveal that the grant programs are greater than they have ever been, taking care of more people than they ever have.	1
ClaimBuster	6315				The question is will it be the strongest in the years to come?	0
ClaimBuster	6316				We've got to get after the users more.	0
ClaimBuster	6317				We feel that with this improvement in the economy; we feel with more receipts and fewer disbursements we can in a moderate way increase, as I recommended, over the next ten years a new parks program that would cast a billion and a half dollars, doubling our national park system.	0
ClaimBuster	6318				I believe we can be better.	0
ClaimBuster	6319				"And she said to me, ""You know, by finally getting bin Laden, that brought some closure to me."""	1
ClaimBuster	6320				And they agree, that if we can do what I've said, we can get it down without going and socking the American taxpayer once again.	0
ClaimBuster	6321				What he's quoting is not the Senate Budget Commiitte, it is a partisan press release by the Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee that's not worth the government -- the taxpayer-paid paper that it's printed on.	1
ClaimBuster	6322				There's some question about their morality.	0
ClaimBuster	6323				You couldn't have chosen your own doctor and that would have been the end.	0
ClaimBuster	6324				I think it's true of Latin America also.	1
ClaimBuster	6325				Outsourcing is going to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	6326				When I was in the United States Congress, I worked with former President Reagan to modernize our strategic weaponry and to pursue arms control in a responsible way.	1
ClaimBuster	6327				Five million Americans have lost their health care; 620,000 Missourians have no health care at all; 96,000 Missourians have lost their health care under President Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	6328				But above all, pick a President who will fight to avoid the day when that God-awful decision ever needs to be made.	0
ClaimBuster	6329				And Pakistan is a very important element in this.	1
ClaimBuster	6330				In fact, I have written a book about it.	1
ClaimBuster	6331				So I'm going to ask the Congress to pass a teacher protection act.	0
ClaimBuster	6332				But at the same time, I had a responsibility, and so did the National Security Coun- Council, to meet the problem at hand.	0
ClaimBuster	6333				Here's the problem: There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	6334				You know, the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks.	0
ClaimBuster	6335				We owe China $500 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	6336				I don't have a tax cut of a scale that you're talking about.	1
ClaimBuster	6337				Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own.	0
ClaimBuster	6338				It's also a departure from tax-and- spend economics, because you can't tax and divide an economy that isn't growing.	0
ClaimBuster	6339				And I would like to see Mr. Ford convince the Polish-Americans and the Czech-Americans and the Hungarian-Americans in this country that those countries don't live under the domination and supervision of the Soviet Union behind the Iron - uh - Curtain.	0
ClaimBuster	6340				He says it's a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.	0
ClaimBuster	6341				Look at where we are today.	0
ClaimBuster	6342				And in the process the negatives began.	0
ClaimBuster	6343				"I really can't believe Mr. Bush is still trying to make trust an issue after ""read my lips"" and 15 million new jobs and embracing what he called voodoo economics and embracing an export enhancement program for farmers he threatened to veto and going all around the country giving out money in programs that he once opposed."	1
ClaimBuster	6344				I'd make sure that Ahmadinejad is indicted under the Genocide Convention.	1
ClaimBuster	6345				I mean we're just a few miles away from Ellis Island.	1
ClaimBuster	6346				And we signed an agreement with North Korea that my administration found out that was not being honored by the North Koreans.	1
ClaimBuster	6347				Key thing here, see, we all come up with images.	1
ClaimBuster	6348				In the past seven years, in President Eisenhower's Administration, this situation has been reversed.	1
ClaimBuster	6349				The bill introduced and erd- sponsored by Senator Douglas was far more effective in trying to stimulate the economy of those areas.	1
ClaimBuster	6350				They are making some progress, not enough for us.	0
ClaimBuster	6351				If you're taking care of an elderly parent, you get a $1,000 deduction.	1
ClaimBuster	6352				That'll help people who want to get off welfare.	0
ClaimBuster	6353				He has no record on reforming of health care.	1
ClaimBuster	6354				One of the key points in foreign policy and national security policy is the need to re-establish the old-fashioned principle that politics ought to stop at the water's edge.	0
ClaimBuster	6355				You know, there's a lot of talk about how to keep the economy growing.	0
ClaimBuster	6356				Trying to figure out who the questioner was.	0
ClaimBuster	6357				I am not going to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	6358				Well the que- the - Mr. Griffin, I believe, who is the head of the Klan, who lives in Tampa, Florida, indicated a - in a statement, I think, two or three weeks ago that he was not going to vote for me, and that he was going to vote for Mr. Nixon.	1
ClaimBuster	6359				I think the American people have only one - uh requirement - that the facts about Mayaguez be given to them accurately and completely.	0
ClaimBuster	6360				But governors are ready; mayors are ready.	0
ClaimBuster	6361				That's a big, big difference.	0
ClaimBuster	6362				And those are my four top priorities should I be the president, not to say we won't be engaged nor work hard to get other nations to come together to prevent atrocity.	0
ClaimBuster	6363				And if we go forward with the kinds of policies that the Vice President is suggesting tonight and has in the past, that debt is going to grow bigger and bigger and bigger.	0
ClaimBuster	6364				The president's reelected you'll see dramatic cuts to our military.	0
ClaimBuster	6365				I certainly don't disagree that we ought to get our troops home from places like the Balkans as soon as we can, as soon as the mission is complete.	0
ClaimBuster	6366				Senator Kennedy quotes the record, which he read from a moment ago, but what he forgets to point out is that the key vote - a uh - vote which I've referred to several times - where he was in the minority was one which rejected his position.	1
ClaimBuster	6367				No Child Left Behind Act, I voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	6368				Under Governor Bush's tax cut proposal, he would spend more money on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of the new spending that he proposes for education, health care, prescription drugs and national defense all combined.	1
ClaimBuster	6369				And it costs more to keep them in prison than it does to send them to Harvard.	1
ClaimBuster	6370				This whole thing has got a lot to do with Ukraine, Crimea, the base of the Russian fleet in Sevastopol.	0
ClaimBuster	6371				I've been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York.	1
ClaimBuster	6372				or we passed one bill, just a couple of weeks ago in the House of Representatives for $500 million - a half a billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	6373				I -- I have to respond to that.	0
ClaimBuster	6374				I know they've appointed a commission to take a look at managed care.	0
ClaimBuster	6375				I favor the particular constitutional amendment that would turn over to the states the uh - individual right to the voters in those states uh - the chance to make a decision by public referendum.	0
ClaimBuster	6376				Well, I guess the president and you and I are three examples of lucky people who married up.	0
ClaimBuster	6377				I think that answers itself.	0
ClaimBuster	6378				So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past?	1
ClaimBuster	6379				We have 35 million people without any insurance at all -- and I see them all the time.	1
ClaimBuster	6380				Part of it's because you can't -- you can't control the classroom.	0
ClaimBuster	6381				And as a consequence we'll have a better trained workforce and that will create jobs because companies want to locate in places where we've got a skilled workforce.	0
ClaimBuster	6382				That's what I've been doing for the last four years.	1
ClaimBuster	6383				I believe marriage is between a man and a woman.	0
ClaimBuster	6384				But it's now time for the next stage of welfare reform, and include fathers and not only mothers.	0
ClaimBuster	6385				But I just don't want to mandate it and risk putting this - setting the recovery back.	0
ClaimBuster	6386				I grew up in a family where my father was gone most of the time because he was at sea and doing our country's business.	1
ClaimBuster	6387				He wants to unravel the six- party talks, or the five-nation coalition that's sending him a clear message.	0
ClaimBuster	6388				And believe me: We're in a bubble right now.	0
ClaimBuster	6389				I will lower taxes on middle-income families.	0
ClaimBuster	6390				But I would fight for a line-item veto, and I would certainly veto every earmark pork-barrel bill.	0
ClaimBuster	6391				"Senator McCain, this is the guy who sang, ""Bomb, bomb, bomb Iran,"" who called for the annihilation of North Korea."	1
ClaimBuster	6392				I pay for it by changing the relationship with the banks.	0
ClaimBuster	6393				We call, first of all, for the creation of a $4 billion urban reinvestment trust fund to do exactly what you spoke about in your question - to rebuild the streets, to rebuild the cities, the leaking water mains.	0
ClaimBuster	6394				Well I might say first of all that I think in case of the Carter administration the sacrifices would be much less.	0
ClaimBuster	6395				My argument with the governor is, do we want this country to go that far left.	0
ClaimBuster	6396				Let me say very categorically you cannot maintain the security of the United States with the kind of defense budget cuts that Governor Carter has indicated.	0
ClaimBuster	6397				And they're not getting in many cases adequate shelter.	0
ClaimBuster	6398				This is the scale of what President Kennedy set out to do with the nuclear test ban treaty.	0
ClaimBuster	6399				More than you spend for food, clothing and shelter combined for taxes under this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	6400				Look, there's no question but the people recognize that we have not produced more (inaudible) on federal lands and in federal waters.	1
ClaimBuster	6401				Because an enemy realizes the stakes.	0
ClaimBuster	6402				You want jobs in the inner city?	0
ClaimBuster	6403				They know the Republican Party hasn't done it.	0
ClaimBuster	6404				But you know, they're the ones that, with the encouragement of Senator Obama and his cronies and his friends in Washington, that went out and made all these risky loans, gave them to people that could never afford to pay back.	1
ClaimBuster	6405				I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that I care very much about.	1
ClaimBuster	6406				This -- what we're seeing taking place in Syria is heartbreaking, and that's why we are going to do everything we can to make sure that we are helping the opposition.	0
ClaimBuster	6407				Nor is the question that all Americans want peace and security an issue in this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	6408				I'm not going to, because that would be pandering.	0
ClaimBuster	6409				We've got to have a president who is going to be advocating on behalf of American businesses and American workers and I make no apology for that.	0
ClaimBuster	6410				And those are the people that I will appoint.	0
ClaimBuster	6411				It's almost like going back to the Malthusian theory, when even then they were saying that everyone would starve with the limited population they had then.	0
ClaimBuster	6412				Then there was another bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the state of Illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, one of the late-term abortion, a really -- one of the bad procedures, a terrible.	1
ClaimBuster	6413				It would be an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to come in, to come into Latin America and to engage us in what would be a civil war, and possibly even worse than that.	0
ClaimBuster	6414				We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton's plan.	1
ClaimBuster	6415				The program which I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have put medical care for the aged in Social Security, and would have been paid for through the Social Security System and the Social Security tax.	1
ClaimBuster	6416				I have been in public service for 24 years, Jim.	1
ClaimBuster	6417				I don't agree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	6418				Every other ca- African country either abstained or voted against us.	1
ClaimBuster	6419				I came through small business.	1
ClaimBuster	6420				Every dollar that I've proposed, I've proposed an additional cut so that it matches.	1
ClaimBuster	6421				You know, I think it's -- that's going to be up to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	6422				Now, I think those are the wrong priorities.	0
ClaimBuster	6423				It has stood for progress; it has stood for concern for the people's welfare.	0
ClaimBuster	6424				And by the way, I've had that experience.	1
ClaimBuster	6425				I believe strongly in a teacher protection act like I mentioned.	0
ClaimBuster	6426				In fact, 1992 we had a bill come before us that all the states had to comply or they're going to lose certain money.	1
ClaimBuster	6427				And I think right now we got to go back.	0
ClaimBuster	6428				And we've got to give them a chance.	0
ClaimBuster	6429				This situation got so bad that I decided I'd better get into it.	0
ClaimBuster	6430				So the vast majority of small businesses would get a tax cut under my plan.	1
ClaimBuster	6431				And I know that I'm someone older than you.	1
ClaimBuster	6432				This has not been an ancient history story.	0
ClaimBuster	6433				And I said that at that time.	1
ClaimBuster	6434				It's his trustees, the President's trustees, not mine, who says it's going to go broke.	0
ClaimBuster	6435				It's also important that we look at the entire global situation.	0
ClaimBuster	6436				Our exports are dramatically up.	1
ClaimBuster	6437				And that's exactly what we're going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	6438				I think the record should show, Mr. Newman, that uh - the Bureau of Census - we checked it just yesterday - indicates that uh - in the four years that uh - Governor Carter was governor of the state of Georgia, uh - expenditures by the government went up over 50 percent Uh - employees of the government in Georgia during his term of office went up over 25 percent; and the figures also show that the uh, uh - bonded indebtedness of the state of Georgia during his governorship went up over 20 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	6439				I'm not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights.	0
ClaimBuster	6440				It's important for NATO to be strong and confident and to help keep the peace in Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	6441				But do we want a constitutional amendment adopted of the kind proposed by the President that gets the local politicians into the business of selecting prayers that our children must either recite in school or be embarrassed and asked to excuse themselves?	0
ClaimBuster	6442				President Obama was right, he said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years.	1
ClaimBuster	6443				And that will be my policy.	0
ClaimBuster	6444				So we're losing our good jobs, so many of them.	0
ClaimBuster	6445				Well, I want to do the same thing, but I've actually identified how we can do that.	0
ClaimBuster	6446				The reason why Prime Minister Allawi said they're coming across the border is because he recognizes that this is a central part of the war on terror.	1
ClaimBuster	6447				Uh - we'll have uh - a safety version built in with complete reorganization of the executive branch of government which I am pledged to do.	0
ClaimBuster	6448				No, I think -- I had five seconds before you interrupted me, was ...	1
ClaimBuster	6449				I've touched more people's lives and seen more heartbreak and hope, more pain and more promise, than anybody else who's run for president this year.	0
ClaimBuster	6450				And I'm fighting to let you get those drugs from Canada, and I'm fighting to let Medicare survive.	1
ClaimBuster	6451				And I've worked hard for a long time to make them better, 90 percent of our kids are there.	1
ClaimBuster	6452				But Russia has been expanding their -- they have a much newer capability than we do.	1
ClaimBuster	6453				Federal government has gone down, Texas's government has gone up.	1
ClaimBuster	6454				What we need to do is make certain we try to return people to work.	0
ClaimBuster	6455				Now the second point we have to understand is this, however.	0
ClaimBuster	6456				This is ridiculous and it ought to be changed.	0
ClaimBuster	6457				On November second all of you will make a very, very important decision.	1
ClaimBuster	6458				No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody.	0
ClaimBuster	6459				I want to have an education system that sets high standards, local control of schools and strong accountability.	0
ClaimBuster	6460				And we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so I know how to do this because I've been involved these issues for many, many years.	1
ClaimBuster	6461				We worked too hard to lower it.	0
ClaimBuster	6462				And so we're moving troops out of Europe and replacing it with more effective equipment.	1
ClaimBuster	6463				And the B - 1 is similarly to be opposed, because for 15 years the Soviet Union has been preparing to meet the B - 1.	1
ClaimBuster	6464				They ought to be engaged in breaking ground in other technologies, doing waste recycling, clean water technology and things of that kind.	0
ClaimBuster	6465				I'd like to create more millionaires than were created under Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan, but I don't want to have 4 years where we have no growth in the private sector, and that's what's happened in the last 4 years.	1
ClaimBuster	6466				And that requires us to make some important choices.	0
ClaimBuster	6467				You know, a generation of office seekers has tried to tell the American people that they could get something for nothing.	0
ClaimBuster	6468				I also think we ought to continue to have good adoption law as an alternative to abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	6469				I think it's very important that we protect marriage as an institution, between a man and a woman.	0
ClaimBuster	6470				But they know what's going on.	0
ClaimBuster	6471				They look at our -- our decision to -- to cut back on our military capabilities.	0
ClaimBuster	6472				I've been to these national parks.	1
ClaimBuster	6473				We never initiated any kind of action; we defended ourselves there.	1
ClaimBuster	6474				No one else believes that's the case.	0
ClaimBuster	6475				I'm really strongly committed to clean water and clean air, and cleaning up the new kinds of challenges like global warming.	0
ClaimBuster	6476				The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems.	0
ClaimBuster	6477				We're not giving this away for nothing.	0
ClaimBuster	6478				You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.	0
ClaimBuster	6479				And one of the things I've tried hardest to do is to tell the American people that we have to get beyond that, we have to understand that we're stronger when we unite around shared values instead of being divided by our differences.	0
ClaimBuster	6480				More Americans at work today than at any time in the history of the country, and a greater percentage of the work force.	1
ClaimBuster	6481				And what I'm afraid of is we've watched over the past year or so, first the president saying, well we'll let the U.N. deal with it.	0
ClaimBuster	6482				I respectfully submit that Senator Kennedy too often would rely too much on the federal government, on what it would do to solve our problems, to stimulate growth.	0
ClaimBuster	6483				But under Governor Romney's definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	6484				There are a million and a half people out there standing in line waiting to adopt children who can't have them any other way.	1
ClaimBuster	6485				If you have extraordinarily high cost, then they pay all over $4,000 out-of-pocket.	1
ClaimBuster	6486				And, again, Bernie Sanders, it's really bad judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	6487				I see jihadists continuing to spread, whether they're rising or just about the same level, hard to precisely measure, but it's clear they're there.	1
ClaimBuster	6488				I believe strongly in the defense of Formosa.	0
ClaimBuster	6489				They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history.	1
ClaimBuster	6490				And now we are putting up a defense of our own.	1
ClaimBuster	6491				But we have never been willing to do anything that, in effect, surrendered freedom any place in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	6492				You've been president four years.	1
ClaimBuster	6493				As you notice, he starts talking about government.	1
ClaimBuster	6494				If you care about it, why don't you veto it?	0
ClaimBuster	6495				It is about what's happening right now in America.	0
ClaimBuster	6496				The Bureau of Labor Statistics today said they made a mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	6497				They would know all about our problems.	0
ClaimBuster	6498				That bill did -- there was another bill that did die in committee.	1
ClaimBuster	6499				It's wonderful that Libya seems to be making some progress, despite this terrible tragedy.	0
ClaimBuster	6500				And, Senator, I remind you that a few years ago when I supported teacher testing while in my home state I was pretty well lambasted by the teachers association.	1
ClaimBuster	6501				We've turned it into a weakness.	0
ClaimBuster	6502				But under no circumstances must the United States ever make an agreement based on trust.	0
ClaimBuster	6503				I know it will require a different kind of leader to go to Washington to say to both Republicans and Democrats, let's come together.	0
ClaimBuster	6504				Yes, we have an increase in the defense budget.	1
ClaimBuster	6505				Mr. Ford has - has advocated since he's been in office over $5 billion in reductions for corporations, special interest groups, and the very, very wealthy who derive their income - not from labor - but from investments.	1
ClaimBuster	6506				He hasn't saved $9 billion with his vetoes.	1
ClaimBuster	6507				Now, in the short-term we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price from OPEC when they want to raise the price.	1
ClaimBuster	6508				I believe in our country.	0
ClaimBuster	6509				But the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have.	0
ClaimBuster	6510				I favor that because I believe that's the best way to aid our schools without running any risk whatever of the federal government telling our teachers what to teach.	0
ClaimBuster	6511				"""No, we're spending your money."	1
ClaimBuster	6512				It does what the GI Bill itself did when I came out of World War II.	0
ClaimBuster	6513				He put forward No Child Left Behind.	1
ClaimBuster	6514				But that's true throughout our whole governmental society.	0
ClaimBuster	6515				Well, it's awful easy when you're dealing with 90-90 hindsight.	0
ClaimBuster	6516				I'm sorry that we couldn't persuade the bringing in of the third candidate, so that he could have been seen also in these debates.	1
ClaimBuster	6517				And so, I would pick people that would be strict constructionists.	0
ClaimBuster	6518				And it's now the smallest number that we have had since the -- the smallest in size since John Kennedy's administration.	1
ClaimBuster	6519				But I was wrong because I thought the tax compromise, going along with 1 Democratic tax increase, would help the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	6520				- reducing the interest rate.	0
ClaimBuster	6521				You must always remember that a president can't stop anything unless he has the people behind him.	0
ClaimBuster	6522				And this was why the provisions that we had in with regard to sanctions, and so forth -- and I'm going to do everything I can, and all of us in the administration are, to join in again when Congress is back at it to get an immigration bill that will give us, once again, control of our borders.	0
ClaimBuster	6523				Well, I've got a plan to do something about that.	0
ClaimBuster	6524				The Nationalists have these two islands.	1
ClaimBuster	6525				I think of all the people I grew up with and went to school with and who I stay in touch with and who nerve let me forget how what we do in Washington affects all of you out there in America.	0
ClaimBuster	6526				They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan.	1
ClaimBuster	6527				And the people who have jobs --	0
ClaimBuster	6528				What's he say to Tony Blair?	0
ClaimBuster	6529				Free nations will answer the hopes and aspirations of their people.	0
ClaimBuster	6530				I don't think we've got a person to waste and I think I owe the American people a White House staff, a Cabinet and appointments that look like America but that meet high standards of excellence, and that's what I'll do.	0
ClaimBuster	6531				It - the next Congress will probably be the first billion-dollar Congress in the history of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	6532				And we start -- we don't do it exclusively -- but we start by rolling back George Bush's unaffordable tax cut for the wealthiest people, people earning more than $200,000 a year, and we pass, hopefully, the McCain-Kerry Commission which identified some $60 billion that we can get.	1
ClaimBuster	6533				I think we're making progress here.	0
ClaimBuster	6534				The stock market was declining six months prior to my arrival.	1
ClaimBuster	6535				As the record develops, I think it's going to become increasingly clear that what I am saying and where I want to take this country is exactly where the country wants to go, and the comparison of approaches is such that I think will lead to further strength.	0
ClaimBuster	6536				The Vice President mentioned my view of long-term for the military.	1
ClaimBuster	6537				And I am confident that Assad's days are numbered.	0
ClaimBuster	6538				Let's get on with it.	0
ClaimBuster	6539				If affirmative action means what I just described what I'm for, then I'm for it.	0
ClaimBuster	6540				Another one would be a number of subsidies for ethanol.	0
ClaimBuster	6541				And I'm very very proud of that choice.	0
ClaimBuster	6542				And of course, this debate also takes place at a time when the tragedy of the USS Cole is on our minds and hearts and insofar as the memorial service is tomorrow, I would like to also extend sympathy to the families of those who have died and those who are still missing, and the injured.	1
ClaimBuster	6543				And domestic sources that are cleaner and better.	0
ClaimBuster	6544				I want to add more free trade agreements so we'll have more trade.	0
ClaimBuster	6545				We haven't been doing enough of that.	0
ClaimBuster	6546				We welcome people coming to this country as immigrants.	1
ClaimBuster	6547				That's how we get growth and how we balance the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	6548				We're cutting taxes for the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	6549				That is what it is.	0
ClaimBuster	6550				Now, General Petraeus had a strategy, the same strategy -- very, very different, because of the conditions and the situation -- but the same fundamental strategy that succeeded in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	6551				And therefore, the term honest broker makes sense.	0
ClaimBuster	6552				Howard, I'm a Southerner, and I share the basic beliefs of my region that an excessive government intrusion into the private affairs of American citizens and also into the private affairs of the free enterprise system.	1
ClaimBuster	6553				That's been his philosophy in the private sector, that's been his philosophy as governor, that's been his philosophy as a presidential candidate.	0
ClaimBuster	6554				See, the first thing we have to do is get you a job.	0
ClaimBuster	6555				We might have to do it slowly.	0
ClaimBuster	6556				You bet there's things that government can do.	0
ClaimBuster	6557				One of the reasons, and I first would like to know which programs you're talking about, and then we could talk on the merits of the programs.	0
ClaimBuster	6558				And so, the plan he talks about simply won't work.	0
ClaimBuster	6559				That is absolutely not true.	0
ClaimBuster	6560				It's driven by, what are we going to need to keep the American people safe?	0
ClaimBuster	6561				Can you add five seconds, Bernie, out of fairness?	0
ClaimBuster	6562				Making sure we've got an army of reading volunteers, trained people to teach with parents and teachers so that our eight year olds can learn to read.	0
ClaimBuster	6563				I think the farm bill that he criticizes was good legislation, outstanding legislation.	0
ClaimBuster	6564				My opponent said this war is a matter of intelligence and law enforcement.	1
ClaimBuster	6565				Why do we have a depletion allowance?	0
ClaimBuster	6566				But we ought to have an aggressive effort to make sure people are educated, to make sure when they get out of high school there's Pell Grants available for them, which is what we've done.	0
ClaimBuster	6567				And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	6568				In order for the sanctions to be effective, we should have been working with the British, French and Germans and other countries.	0
ClaimBuster	6569				Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict.	0
ClaimBuster	6570				We have to press the Afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people.	0
ClaimBuster	6571				If you're re-elected, we'll get to a trillion-dollar debt.	1
ClaimBuster	6572				My -- my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	6573				See, I don't believe any other country can pick up the mantel.	0
ClaimBuster	6574				New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses.	0
ClaimBuster	6575				You can't have kids coming out of college, half of them can't find a job today, or a job that's commensurate with their college degree.	1
ClaimBuster	6576				To get it, to get $150 billion in new taxes, you got to go down to the guy that's making $36,600.	0
ClaimBuster	6577				But he's in the arena.	0
ClaimBuster	6578				I have number 1 and 1A.	1
ClaimBuster	6579				These uh - characteristics of our country have been endangered under Mr. Ford.	0
ClaimBuster	6580				Let's just talk about the CAFE standards -- that's the fuel efficiency standards.	1
ClaimBuster	6581				But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of.	0
ClaimBuster	6582				I think it's going to be difficult; but I'm confident that this country can meet its responsibilities.	0
ClaimBuster	6583				And some domestic programs as well, Andrea.	0
ClaimBuster	6584				Four thousand people a day are coming across the border.	1
ClaimBuster	6585				After all, a lot of the energy is produced from the Middle East, and so I appreciate what the administration is doing.	1
ClaimBuster	6586				I think if we had stuck by that position last winter, we would have been in a better position in May.	0
ClaimBuster	6587				The president says I've changed my mind.	1
ClaimBuster	6588				I don't see how you can lead troops if you say it's the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time.	0
ClaimBuster	6589				And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest.	1
ClaimBuster	6590				You cannot make concessions to terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	6591				Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	6592				But, as I said, we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	6593				Thirty years ago there were three police officers on the street for every crime; today there are three crimes for every police officer.	1
ClaimBuster	6594				What we need is people to stop talking and start doing.	0
ClaimBuster	6595				I mean, we can remember when President Kennedy in the Cuban missile crisis sent his secretary of state to Paris to meet with DeGaulle.	1
ClaimBuster	6596				And this is the first president in 72 years to preside over an economy in America that has lost jobs, 1.6 million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	6597				We weren't guaranteeing anything, anybody anything except the chance to prove they were qualified, the chance to prove that they could do it.	0
ClaimBuster	6598				I know what it's like to be in a hospital.	0
ClaimBuster	6599				Well, we finally passed the Kassebaum bill.	1
ClaimBuster	6600				It's sort of their golden oldie, you know.	0
ClaimBuster	6601				Let me tell you what I√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ll do.	0
ClaimBuster	6602				In fact, they have got a commission right now in Congress, a bipartisan commission, looking at all the different options they will present to the next Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	6603				This is an essential that we get it right.	0
ClaimBuster	6604				It will probably happen in the year 2012 or 2015.	0
ClaimBuster	6605				"He said, ""The buck stops here.''"	1
ClaimBuster	6606				It's our job to fix the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	6607				I'm talking about our willingness to bear any burdens in order to maintain our own freedom and in order to meet our freedom around the globe.	0
ClaimBuster	6608				The other thing we have to do, though, is we've got to see around the corners.	0
ClaimBuster	6609				We have to persuade these other countries not to restrict our goods coming in, not to act as if there was a dollar gap; and third, we have to persuade them to assume some of the responsibilities that up till now we've maintained, to assist underdeveloped countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia make an economic breakthrough on their own.	0
ClaimBuster	6610				They get $25,000 a year income, that makes them ineligible.	1
ClaimBuster	6611				And then came some other program, and then came healthcare, and then came the tax increase and a lot of these things stopped in 1994 because then the Congress changed, and I think we've done a good job.	0
ClaimBuster	6612				We want to help pay for you to gain the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	6613				The code ought to encourage marriage, not discourage marriage.	0
ClaimBuster	6614				Have you looked at your pension?	0
ClaimBuster	6615				The interest rates have come down about 9 or 10 points and, we think, must come down further.	1
ClaimBuster	6616				The initial cost is about $54 billion, and then when you add in the additional costs - not only the construction of the system, the missiles and the personnel, and so on - when you add in the additional costs over the lifecycle of that system, over $100 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	6617				Pretty divided in the 2000 election.	0
ClaimBuster	6618				We also have seen Mr. Ford exclude himself from access to the public.	1
ClaimBuster	6619				We'll lose it when it's taken out of our paycheck before we even get it.	0
ClaimBuster	6620				But it was a tremendous shift from administrative jobs into the delivery of services.	1
ClaimBuster	6621				But the policies he's put in place from Obamacare to Dodd-Frank to his tax policies to his regulatory policies, these policies combined have not let this economy take off and grow like it could have.	1
ClaimBuster	6622				I think at the time, the mistake that was made was signing off on the deal late on Saturday night in the middle of the night.	0
ClaimBuster	6623				I want think they want somebody with common sense who can do what's best for the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	6624				They're always very loyal to us, and I appreciate that.	0
ClaimBuster	6625				We have elections so people can make decisions about this.	0
ClaimBuster	6626				If they just left the Clean Air Act all alone the way it is today, no change, the air would be cleaner than it is if you pass the Clear Skies act.	0
ClaimBuster	6627				The president of the US was told officially it was a $20-billion problem.	1
ClaimBuster	6628				And the main reason we'll succeed is because the Iraqis want to be free.	0
ClaimBuster	6629				Does it create jobs, raise incomes, and further our national security?	0
ClaimBuster	6630				We had a guarantee on the S&Ls, right?	0
ClaimBuster	6631				Well, now let's look at these bills that the Vice President suggests were too extreme.	0
ClaimBuster	6632				So that's just another one of those little fruit-loopy things they make up to try to, instead of facing issues, to try to redefine a person that's running against them.	0
ClaimBuster	6633				What you did -- and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	6634				The facts are, there - the Soviet Union relationship with Egypt is uh - at a low level.	1
ClaimBuster	6635				They were at 21.5% under Jimmy Carter, and inflation was 15.	1
ClaimBuster	6636				And I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there.	0
ClaimBuster	6637				The government was very much involved; so was the housing industry; so was the banking industry; so were housing advocates; so were non-profit agencies; so were governors and mayors and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing.	1
ClaimBuster	6638				He also said a moment ago that we would get more money to finance his programs by revising the tax laws, including depletion.	1
ClaimBuster	6639				That is the central issue of our time.	0
ClaimBuster	6640				Well, the difference is is that I can get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	6641				And it is a wonderful thing to see when you get out there among the people.	0
ClaimBuster	6642				The facts are -- I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated...	1
ClaimBuster	6643				And he's trying to make you believe it because he wants you to think I change my mind.	0
ClaimBuster	6644				That is the accepted procedure between nations; and my judgment is that we should follow the advice of Theodore Roosevelt: Be strong; maintain a strong position; but also speak softly.	0
ClaimBuster	6645				But I also believe that we've got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments.	0
ClaimBuster	6646				The Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it.	1
ClaimBuster	6647				So what does he do?	0
ClaimBuster	6648				Mr. Ford has had that same choice to make.	1
ClaimBuster	6649				You know, Elizabeth, I really respect your -- the feeling that's in your question.	0
ClaimBuster	6650				It is naive and dangerous to take a policy that he suggested the other day, which is to have bilateral relations with North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	6651				So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	6652				You've mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower.	1
ClaimBuster	6653				There are 900 sequestered in the White House.	1
ClaimBuster	6654				Capital gains rate, cut it in half, cut it 28 percent to 14 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	6655				...that's a -- I indicated...	0
ClaimBuster	6656				I think he said that Israel was a - a military burden on us and that Iran hoped to reestablish the Persian Empire.	1
ClaimBuster	6657				But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy.	1
ClaimBuster	6658				The rise of obesity amongst young Americans is one of the most alarming statistics that there is.	1
ClaimBuster	6659				We don't have free trade.	0
ClaimBuster	6660				We have seen increases in coal production and coal employment.	1
ClaimBuster	6661				We've added five hundred thousand jobs in the last two months.	1
ClaimBuster	6662				I'm no longer a public official.	1
ClaimBuster	6663				We got a big philosophical difference here tonight between one who thinks the government can do all these things through tax and spend, and one who thinks it ought to go the other way.	0
ClaimBuster	6664				They ought to have their voices heard, but they shouldn't have a big megaphone that drowns out the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	6665				Why, when you said you'd filed legislation in your first year didn't you do it?	1
ClaimBuster	6666				These people depend upon all of us for the little security that they have, and I'm not going to do it that way.	0
ClaimBuster	6667				In 1973 when there was an oil embargo, Iran did not participate.	1
ClaimBuster	6668				We cut taxes 19 times.	1
ClaimBuster	6669				"I have heard you say on one TV appearance, ""the media made me do it."""	1
ClaimBuster	6670				We discuss tonight domestic issues, but I would not want that to be any implication to be given that this does not involve directly our struggle with Mr. Khrushchev for survival.	0
ClaimBuster	6671				We're spending more money, but let's raise the standards and measure early and solve problems now, before it's too late.	0
ClaimBuster	6672				At the time, Mr. Gannon, that I made the recommendation for a $28 billion tax cut - three-quarters of it to go to individual taxpayers and 25 percent to American business.	1
ClaimBuster	6673				And when we're weak at home - weaker than all our allies - that weakness weakens the whole free world.	0
ClaimBuster	6674				We don't need to do that any more.	0
ClaimBuster	6675				We cannot afford to have a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	6676				Let me -- let me complete...	0
ClaimBuster	6677				I just don't believe we ought to be out there running down teachers and attacking them the way you did at the Republican convention.	0
ClaimBuster	6678				And at the end of that seven years we were engaged in a war in Korea which cost of thirty thousand American lives.	1
ClaimBuster	6679				I'm not some extremist out here.	0
ClaimBuster	6680				It may come as a shock for somebody who has been in Washington for so long.	0
ClaimBuster	6681				Well, first of all, I think that we are safer in some ways.	0
ClaimBuster	6682				To do that, we're taking back jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	6683				This is a very important country to us.	0
ClaimBuster	6684				I think there's a great difference between the Government of Iran threatening our diplomatic personnel, and there is a government that you can see and can put your hand on.	0
ClaimBuster	6685				The future of things that matter to you -- in terms of civil rights, what kind of Justice Department you'll have, whether we'll enforce the law.	0
ClaimBuster	6686				In Iraq, he had this cockamamie idea about dividing Iraq into three countries.	1
ClaimBuster	6687				So if you're starting a business, where would you rather start it?	0
ClaimBuster	6688				That's true of any family.	0
ClaimBuster	6689				That was a tax credit for the employer.	1
ClaimBuster	6690				As far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the -- we're defending other countries.	0
ClaimBuster	6691				And you know what they said to us?	0
ClaimBuster	6692				You're going to get a tax relief in my plan.	0
ClaimBuster	6693				That's the best way to get people back in the system.	0
ClaimBuster	6694				We've got to have no more trickle down.	0
ClaimBuster	6695				"You'll virtually -- it's virtually impossible given our regulations."""	0
ClaimBuster	6696				And what we've done when it comes to trade is not only sign three trade deals to open up new markets, but we've also set up a task force for trade that goes after anybody who is taking advantage of American workers or businesses and not creating a level playing field.	1
ClaimBuster	6697				But we have enormous differences.	0
ClaimBuster	6698				I might also add that there are decisions that are made in the Oval Office by every President which are profound in nature.	0
ClaimBuster	6699				Now, in pointing out the things that are wrong, I think we ought to emphasize America's strengths.	0
ClaimBuster	6700				And the way to make sure they understand that is by having, from the very beginning, the tightest sanctions possible.	0
ClaimBuster	6701				When he came home and he wanted to become a nurse, he had to start from scratch.	1
ClaimBuster	6702				So with all the talk about family values, I know about family values -- I wouldn't be here without them.	0
ClaimBuster	6703				Until we got a Republican Congress, we finally got action, I'm proud of my colleagues in the Republican Party for getting that done.	1
ClaimBuster	6704				I can think of nothing that will be a greater blow to the prestige of the United States among the free nations in Asia than for us to take Senator Kennedy's advan- advice to go - go against what a majority of the members of the Senate, both Democrat and Republican, did - said in 1955, and to say in advance we will surrender an area to the Communists.	1
ClaimBuster	6705				I notice that the Governor did not mention any testing.	1
ClaimBuster	6706				We've mobilized sanctions against that government.	1
ClaimBuster	6707				There were some of us -- there were some of us that stood up against it.	1
ClaimBuster	6708				But, George, that's no answer.	0
ClaimBuster	6709				I care about our kids.	0
ClaimBuster	6710				I don't believe, uh - Mr. Frankel that uh - the Yugoslavians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	6711				It was the most complete documentation by any president of any agreement signed by a president on behalf of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	6712				The truth of the matter is, we did cut the increase in spending in half.	1
ClaimBuster	6713				That's a classic example of a strategy that's embarrassed us, strengthened our opposition, and undermined the moral authority of our people and our country in the region.	0
ClaimBuster	6714				I think the first one was related to uh - the unwarranted influence of American Jews on the media and uh - in the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	6715				And you know this liberal charge, that's what their party always drags out when they get in a tight race.	0
ClaimBuster	6716				That's how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasn't advancing that cause.	1
ClaimBuster	6717				Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then?	0
ClaimBuster	6718				We convinced Libya to disarm.	1
ClaimBuster	6719				And so John likes -- John, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007.	0
ClaimBuster	6720				And I would just say that it seems to me that that's the way it ought to be.	0
ClaimBuster	6721				We cannot continue to tell the American people that we're going to build all of these systems, and at the same time, invest in important things here at home, and be serious about building a strong and good America.	0
ClaimBuster	6722				But I reserve the right, as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think it's going to keep America safe.	0
ClaimBuster	6723				She's worked on it longer than I have.	1
ClaimBuster	6724				I -- I want to invest in research.	0
ClaimBuster	6725				Well I think this Republican administration has been almost all style, and spectacular, and not substance.	0
ClaimBuster	6726				Barbara I think is doing a superb job in destroying the myth about AIDS.	0
ClaimBuster	6727				But unfortunately, in nowhere in the world is America's influence will grow.	0
ClaimBuster	6728				I started working on welfare reform in 1980 because I was sick of seeing people trapped in a system that was increasingly isolating them and making their kids more vulnerable to get in trouble.	1
ClaimBuster	6729				The fact is that this nation, in the eight years before I became President, had its own military strength decreased.	1
ClaimBuster	6730				I want to keep our neighborhoods much, much better in terms of anti-crime, and that's why I would appoint judges that have a little more sympathy for the victims of crime and a little less for the criminals.	0
ClaimBuster	6731				That happened before you came into office.	1
ClaimBuster	6732				I don't have any policy against hiring anyone; whether it's lifestyle or whatever, we don't have any policy of that kind, never have had in my office or will we have in the future.	1
ClaimBuster	6733				But I believe that we can now establish in the White House a good relationship with Congress, a good relationship with our people, set very high goals for our country.	0
ClaimBuster	6734				You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were.	1
ClaimBuster	6735				Parents are teaching their children right from wrong, and the message oftentimes gets undermined by the popular culture.	0
ClaimBuster	6736				When we took office, we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards, lack of safety features, that we stopped buying additional park land until we had rectified this with what was to be a 5-year program -- but it's just about finished already -- a billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	6737				Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate.	1
ClaimBuster	6738				Is this any reason for complacency?	0
ClaimBuster	6739				Welfare reform is one way to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	6740				It's ruled by a handful of tribes.	1
ClaimBuster	6741				I just have to respond very quickly, just to correct -- just to correct the record.	0
ClaimBuster	6742				In fact, his environmental enforcement chief air-quality person at the EPA resigned in protest over what they're doing to what they are calling the new source performance standards for air quality.	1
ClaimBuster	6743				The time line that I've set out -- and again, I want to correct the president, because he's misled again this evening on what I've said.	0
ClaimBuster	6744				I have talked to Negro mothers.	1
ClaimBuster	6745				That was certainly the case from the minute I got there.	0
ClaimBuster	6746				Now we're changing to one conflict.	1
ClaimBuster	6747				Am I allowed to respond to that?	0
ClaimBuster	6748				The United States is pursuing a new set of nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	6749				That's where the vast majority of people get their health care.	1
ClaimBuster	6750				Of course I -- I don't know Putin.	1
ClaimBuster	6751				If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails.	0
ClaimBuster	6752				I respect him for that.	0
ClaimBuster	6753				I think you can see that.	0
ClaimBuster	6754				She wants amnesty for everybody.	1
ClaimBuster	6755				So, we thought that it would be simpler to negotiate first with those.	0
ClaimBuster	6756				I do think the use of special forces, which we're using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just...	1
ClaimBuster	6757				Tipper and I have four children.	1
ClaimBuster	6758				It was wrong, and my plan for the future is better.	0
ClaimBuster	6759				Number two, with regards to Iraq, you and I agreed I believe that there should be a status of forces agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	6760				Now, the other superpowers need to do their part.	0
ClaimBuster	6761				And, above all, I want a nation that's strong.	0
ClaimBuster	6762				Our rate of uninsured, the percentage of uninsured in Texas has gone down, while the percentage of uninsured in America has gone up.	1
ClaimBuster	6763				We can lend money but we have to do it wisely.	0
ClaimBuster	6764				Now, what has been accomplished by the Helsinki agreement?	0
ClaimBuster	6765				We have to bring back respect to law enforcement.	0
ClaimBuster	6766				All across our country -- go to Ohio, 1.4 million Ohioans have no health insurance, 114,000 of them lost it under President Bush; Wisconsin, 82,000 Wisconsinites lost it under President Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	6767				I was in Kyoto, and I was part of that.	1
ClaimBuster	6768				The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business.	1
ClaimBuster	6769				The Chinese Communists have always had a large population.	1
ClaimBuster	6770				What we need is to try to seek individualized bilateral relationships with countries, regardless of their size, and to establish world-order politics, which means that we want to preserve peace through strength.	0
ClaimBuster	6771				We can't expect entrepreneurs and businesses large and small to take their life savings or their company's money and invest in America if they think we're headed to the road to Greece.	0
ClaimBuster	6772				I've had the best healthcare from government hospitals, Army hospitals and I know its importance, but we've got to fix it.	0
ClaimBuster	6773				What explains this administration cozying up to the Argentine dictators after they took over?	0
ClaimBuster	6774				We can only get 4,000 to 5,000 into South Korea.	1
ClaimBuster	6775				Is our strength and prestige rising?	0
ClaimBuster	6776				It broke my heart to go to the flood scene in Del Rio where a fellow and his family got completely uprooted.	1
ClaimBuster	6777				It doesn't work that way when you're president.	0
ClaimBuster	6778				And I know it's been going on a long time.	0
ClaimBuster	6779				He had a Democrat House, a Democrat Senate, super majority in both Houses.	1
ClaimBuster	6780				Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders.	1
ClaimBuster	6781				We've seen progress and gains in schools that were having a terrible time.	0
ClaimBuster	6782				You know, it's just not that simple.	0
ClaimBuster	6783				I've got no illusions about that.	0
ClaimBuster	6784				So my attitude coming into office was that we are going to insist that China plays by the same rules as everybody else.	0
ClaimBuster	6785				It was a tribute after President Carter's election to the National Education Association who send a lot of delegates to the Democratic convention, who gives 99.5 percent of their money, Democrat Democrats, and the President, and a lot of the teachers send their kids to private schools or better public schools.	1
ClaimBuster	6786				You have -- wait a minute.	0
ClaimBuster	6787				If he unbalances the budget, that means you have inflation, and that will be, of course, a very cruel blow to the very people - the older people - that we've been talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	6788				If you vote one way you will have an expansion of family leave.	0
ClaimBuster	6789				Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership.	1
ClaimBuster	6790				But he raised the question of my father and said, well, your father, Prescott Bush, was against McCarthy, you should be ashamed of yourself, McCarthyism.	1
ClaimBuster	6791				On the domestic side, what we must do is have change that empowers people -- not change for the sake of change, tax and spend.	0
ClaimBuster	6792				The people I talked to their spirits were high.	0
ClaimBuster	6793				One is Governor Avell- Averell Harriman, who visited the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and the other is James Schlesinger, whom I think you accompanied to uh - China.	1
ClaimBuster	6794				Well, always in the past we've had an ability to have a strong defense and also have - to have a strong uh - domestic economy, and also to be strong in our reputation and influence within the community of nations.	0
ClaimBuster	6795				And my daughters and my wife are people who just are filled with that sense of what's right, what's wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	6796				I'm absolutely, adamently opposed to that.	0
ClaimBuster	6797				And when they have a --they a --deals that are good for us, as China started to do--the changes in China since Barbara and I lived there is absolutely amazing, in terms of incentive, in partnership and things of this nature.	0
ClaimBuster	6798				It's a terrible problems in terms of flexibility on private insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	6799				Of course he's not, but he's not gonna be better off if we grow the government, if we invest, as Governor Clinton says, invest in more government.	0
ClaimBuster	6800				Now, if you break it, you made a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	6801				The president's path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay.	1
ClaimBuster	6802				The use of diplomacy in this situation has already, well, it goes hour-by-hour and day-by-day now.	0
ClaimBuster	6803				Well, we'll include it in that.	0
ClaimBuster	6804				So I don't believe that the fact you've got that long resume or had that experience is the real question.	0
ClaimBuster	6805				And the reason, one of the major reasons why we're in the difficulties we are in today is because spending got out of control.	0
ClaimBuster	6806				It's naive and dangerous to say that.	0
ClaimBuster	6807				And in return, get one-fifth of the benefits, because most of the tax reductions go to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.	1
ClaimBuster	6808				And we've got uh - the highest unemployment we've had uh - under Mr. Ford's administration, since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	6809				Different people with different views fight with each other.	0
ClaimBuster	6810				What he's asking me is, will I have a litmus test for my judges?	1
ClaimBuster	6811				They haven't said what's going to happen, whether they're going to have it declared addictive.	1
ClaimBuster	6812				You learn a lot from financial disclosure.	0
ClaimBuster	6813				One of the things I think that really frustrates people is that so often political campaigns seem to be more about the politicians that are running than the people.	0
ClaimBuster	6814				Civilians get onto aircraft, and their luggage is X-rayed, but the cargo hold is not X- rayed.	1
ClaimBuster	6815				I think that we ought to make all schools gun free.	0
ClaimBuster	6816				I've said that I agree with the Administration policy.	1
ClaimBuster	6817				How do we pay for it?	0
ClaimBuster	6818				I think I'm a reasonably likable guy.	0
ClaimBuster	6819				And our country has no idea.	0
ClaimBuster	6820				I think it's always a tragic situation.	0
ClaimBuster	6821				I agree with some of what Mr. Bush said, but it's nowhere near enough.	0
ClaimBuster	6822				And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated.	0
ClaimBuster	6823				If we could develop a principle that would say both sides could fire all their missiles and no one would get hurt, I suppose it's a good idea.	0
ClaimBuster	6824				Here we have Cuba 90 miles from our shores, and what have we done, we passed the law that gave people a right to sue and the President postponed it for six months.	1
ClaimBuster	6825				I've appointed over 130, so I have a record.	1
ClaimBuster	6826				In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you're already getting a rebate.	1
ClaimBuster	6827				In both cases where they've done so, there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford administration.	1
ClaimBuster	6828				What I cared about is could we work together.	0
ClaimBuster	6829				Now, I've outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement at home and abroad, doubling the number of drug enforcement agents, having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th of January when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together.	1
ClaimBuster	6830				Keep the trust with the older men and women of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	6831				How in the world the president said no to that pipeline?	0
ClaimBuster	6832				These two islands are in the area of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	6833				So, it isn't that we're taking too little - from taxpayer - we're spending too much still.	0
ClaimBuster	6834				That is wholly wrong, wholly in error, and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	6835				This should continue and it can be stepped up to give them hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that I can testify they have so deeply within them.	0
ClaimBuster	6836				And therefore I think that was a sound proposal and that is why I supported it and I regret that it did not pass.	1
ClaimBuster	6837				His chief education adviser is in jail He's in jail because he betrayed the public trust.	1
ClaimBuster	6838				We have a good housing program, uh - that uh - will result in cutting uh - the down payments by 50 percent and uh - having mortgage payments uh lower at the beginning of any mortgage period.	0
ClaimBuster	6839				One of the best in advancing all kinds of benefits for children to grow up healthy and strong.	1
ClaimBuster	6840				It's absolutely the right thing to do, to have crippling sanctions.	0
ClaimBuster	6841				We don't know who the rebels are.	0
ClaimBuster	6842				I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country.	0
ClaimBuster	6843				What's involved here is the question of leadership for the whole free world.	0
ClaimBuster	6844				We are the one that worked out the prison labor deal.	1
ClaimBuster	6845				That's the kind of leadership that we need to show.	0
ClaimBuster	6846				But, the Dorgan Task Force, the bipartisan task force estimated that we could collect about $35 billion in the fifth year, $105 billion over five years, the other study even more than that	1
ClaimBuster	6847				And I want to tell you what I tell them.	0
ClaimBuster	6848				We talk about the unemployment lines.	0
ClaimBuster	6849				Because if it's just us that are imposing sanctions -- we've had sanctions in place a long time.	1
ClaimBuster	6850				I want to say, since this is the last time I'll be on a platform with my opponents, that even though I disagree with Mr. Perot on how fast we can reduce the deficit and how much we can increase taxes on the middle class, I really respect what he's done in this campaign to bring the issue of deficit reduction to our attention.	0
ClaimBuster	6851				Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down, and we will as we come up with a good, solid plan with the Congress for bringing that deficit down.	0
ClaimBuster	6852				And Social Security is not enough for a lot of people to live on, or at least is not enough for them to maintain anything like their previous lifestyle.	1
ClaimBuster	6853				But the first and most important thing is to start creating jobs in America.	0
ClaimBuster	6854				All paid for by your friends on Wall Street that gave so much money because they know you're going to protect them.	0
ClaimBuster	6855				In New Hampshire Senator Kerrey said you ought to level, you ought to tell the truth about it.	1
ClaimBuster	6856				You know, it's hard work to try to love her as best as I can, knowing full well that the decision I made caused her loved one to be in harm's way.	0
ClaimBuster	6857				If you make it as a young man, time passes.	0
ClaimBuster	6858				I don't think he would have fallen had we not used the force.	0
ClaimBuster	6859				And if we don't, we will be spending our children's money.	0
ClaimBuster	6860				And I noted that nobody was really benefitting except a very small group at the top.	0
ClaimBuster	6861				We should sustain uh - the Department of Justice in its efforts and the F.B.I., and we should be continually alert.	0
ClaimBuster	6862				Because there are millions of seniors who are living almost hand to mouth.	0
ClaimBuster	6863				We have an opportunity working together to build that future, to build a better America, to build a best America, because the best America doesn't hide.	0
ClaimBuster	6864				Because the fact is, almost everything she's done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it's been a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	6865				And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are.	0
ClaimBuster	6866				It's terrible what's going on in Chicago.	0
ClaimBuster	6867				The rest of the Western world, we are told, may see its consumption increase from 51 million barrels to about 66 million.	1
ClaimBuster	6868				We have lost over 4,000 lives.	1
ClaimBuster	6869				I don't see how you can lead this country to succeed in Iraq if you say wrong war, wrong time, wrong place.	0
ClaimBuster	6870				You need small schools, not big schools.	0
ClaimBuster	6871				"I remember sitting in the White House looking at those generals, saying, ""Do you have what you need in this war?"	0
ClaimBuster	6872				Now, with respect to immigration reform, the president broke his promise on immigration reform.	1
ClaimBuster	6873				Well, my rebuttal is I've heard the national debt blamed for a lot of things, but not for illegal immigration across our border -- [laughter] -- and it has nothing to do with it.	0
ClaimBuster	6874				Right now the president is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to research bunker-busting nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	6875				If you're a single mother making $22,000 a year and you have two children, under this tax code, for every additional dollar you make, you pay a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone making more than $200,000 a year, and that is not right.	1
ClaimBuster	6876				I mean, look at it, and that's what we're asking America to have?	0
ClaimBuster	6877				Can any American looking at the situation in Latin America feel contented with what's happening today, when a candidate for the presidency of Brazil feels it necessary to call - not on Washington during the campaign - but on Castro in Havana, in order to pick up the support of the Castro supporters in Brazil?	0
ClaimBuster	6878				That's how you create jobs and become competitive.	0
ClaimBuster	6879				I believe that to be accurate, I had 49 percent; President Ford, 39 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	6880				"Now, Mr. President, you said, ""There you go again,'' right?"	0
ClaimBuster	6881				I also support modernization of our strategic and tactical weaponry.	0
ClaimBuster	6882				That's not what I believe.	0
ClaimBuster	6883				So we always had a rule, we divided by six.	1
ClaimBuster	6884				America can help that happen.	0
ClaimBuster	6885				How do you miss $6 billion?	0
ClaimBuster	6886				Incomes are rising for the first time in a decade, the crime rates, the welfare rolls are falling, we're putting , 100,000 more police on the street.	1
ClaimBuster	6887				In the case of Helsinki, thirty-five nations signed an agreement, including the secretary of state for the Vatican - I can't under any circumstances believe that the - His Holiness, the Pope would agree by signing that agreement that the thirty-five nations have turned over to the Warsaw Pact nations the domination of the - Eastern Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	6888				And there was some very interesting testimony given by Governor Carter's successor, Governor Busby, before a Senate committee a few uh - months ago on how he found the Medicaid program when he came into office following Governor Carter.	0
ClaimBuster	6889				You said that there was no history of violence between Shia and Sunni.	1
ClaimBuster	6890				It is, though, trying to understand the heartbeat of the country.	0
ClaimBuster	6891				It's sort of like what Senator Dole did when he sponsored the Americans with Disabilities Act and said to certain stores, okay, you have to make it accessible to people in wheelchairs.	1
ClaimBuster	6892				Then have another task force on crime because, next to jobs, our people are concerned about their safety.	0
ClaimBuster	6893				The major effort we must put forward is to put our people back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	6894				Now in the last Congress - the special session of the Congress - there was a bill: one by the President, one by Senator Kennedy and members of his party.	1
ClaimBuster	6895				Uh - the polls uh - are good indications of fluctuations, but they vary widely one from another.	1
ClaimBuster	6896				But the next President of the United States will have to make some tough and difficult decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	6897				And so you saw ten grandchildren there jumping all over their grandfather at the convention.	1
ClaimBuster	6898				I think it's a cynicism in Washington and it doesn't have to be that way.	0
ClaimBuster	6899				We can eliminate our dependence on foreign oil by building 45 new nuclear plants, power plants, right away.	0
ClaimBuster	6900				But we're providing health care for our people.	1
ClaimBuster	6901				It keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have guns.	1
ClaimBuster	6902				He said I misled on Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	6903				I differ with the 2 here on that.	1
ClaimBuster	6904				And it wasn't just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldn't get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees.	1
ClaimBuster	6905				There is a connection between interest rates and inflation, but I would call to your attention that in 1981 while we were operating still on the Carter-Mondale budget that we inherited -- that the interest rates came down from 211/2, down toward the 12 or 13 figure.	1
ClaimBuster	6906				We're exhausted in terms of nuclear.	0
ClaimBuster	6907				And I recommended that to the Congress with a budget ceiling of three hundred and ninety-five billion dollars, and that would have permitted us to have a $25 billion tax reduction.	1
ClaimBuster	6908				I think they're different because they're based on prejudice and hatred, which gives rise to crimes that have not just a single victim, but they're intended to stigmatize and dehumanize a whole group of people.	0
ClaimBuster	6909				You called it the gold standard.	1
ClaimBuster	6910				I would like a balanced budget amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	6911				We're doing this all around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	6912				You know, we won that conflict in Kosovo without losing a single human life in combat, a single American life in combat.	1
ClaimBuster	6913				Well, I'll just say that the question is of experience and the question also is uh - what our judgment is of the future, and what our goals are for the United States, and what ability we have to implement those goals.	0
ClaimBuster	6914				But the last point I want to make is this.	0
ClaimBuster	6915				I am for the right, as the governor says- -I'm a sportsman and I don't think you ought to eliminate all kinds of weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	6916				And I believe on this great moral issue he should speak out and give his views clearly.	0
ClaimBuster	6917				That's been displayed again and again in a very tangible way.	1
ClaimBuster	6918				Particularly some of the smaller producers.	0
ClaimBuster	6919				I was talking about the things that have been accomplished, and that was referring to the revival of patriotism and optimism, the new spirit that we're finding all over America.	0
ClaimBuster	6920				And it wasn't very detailed.	0
ClaimBuster	6921				What is a President charged with doing when he takes his oath of office?	0
ClaimBuster	6922				You know, there have been times, Governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign, where it sounded like you thought that you'd do the same things we did, but you'd say them louder and somehow that -- that would make a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	6923				Shortly after I became president in uh - December of 1974, I met with uh - General Secretary Brezhnev in Vladivostok and we agreed to a mutual cap on the ballistic missile launchers at a ceiling of twenty-four hundred - which means that the Soviet Union, if that becomes a permanent agreement, will have to make a reduction in their launchers that they now have or plan to have.	1
ClaimBuster	6924				"I knew it wouldn't work."""	0
ClaimBuster	6925				We didn't do it faster than that because we didn't want to disrupt the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	6926				And three of those checks were my grandparents'.	1
ClaimBuster	6927				And it's not an easy problem to solve.	0
ClaimBuster	6928				I know that some churches do.	0
ClaimBuster	6929				The United States is trusted by other elements in southern Africa.	0
ClaimBuster	6930				Now looking at Senator Kennedy's credentials: he is suggesting that he will move America faster and further than I will.	0
ClaimBuster	6931				But to say that there's only one focus on the war on terror doesn't really understand the nature of the war on terror.	0
ClaimBuster	6932				What I wanna do is not to raise taxes, but to eliminate loopholes.	0
ClaimBuster	6933				And finally, whether or not there was an exit strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	6934				Let me uh - speak out very strongly.	0
ClaimBuster	6935				And so, yeah, sometimes I agree with some of these groups in Washington and sometimes I don't.	0
ClaimBuster	6936				Would we be better off building that bridge to the future together so we can all walk across it or saying you can get across yourself?	0
ClaimBuster	6937				I don't think they do, enough.	0
ClaimBuster	6938				I can understand, after the vice presidential debate, why Mr. Bush would want no more debates.	0
ClaimBuster	6939				We know that the path we're taking is not working.	0
ClaimBuster	6940				When the audit's complete, I'll do it.	0
ClaimBuster	6941				And I'll bring that pipeline in from Canada.	0
ClaimBuster	6942				The US is doing better than a lot.	1
ClaimBuster	6943				If we can stand up for our economics, we ought to be able to preserve the democratic interests of the people of China.	0
ClaimBuster	6944				The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about.	0
ClaimBuster	6945				And it's got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman who's facing this terribly difficult decision.	0
ClaimBuster	6946				It was a terrorist attack and it took a long time for that to be told to the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	6947				Why didn't she do something about it?	0
ClaimBuster	6948				We need a $2,000 credit, rebate for people, working people that don't have insurance, they can get in the marketplace and start purchasing insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	6949				It is on the ballot in this election, make no mistake about it.	1
ClaimBuster	6950				Some of them had been there before.	1
ClaimBuster	6951				I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America; to see how we're doing things; to wonder what the resident of the United States is doing; and not to look at Khrushchev, or look at the Chinese Communists.	0
ClaimBuster	6952				And he's doing a very effective job of that, in his way.	0
ClaimBuster	6953				People out there listening know what I believe.	0
ClaimBuster	6954				In the last debate,1 (FOOTNOTE) the Vice President of the United States said that I said the marines had died shamefully and died in shame in Lebanon.	1
ClaimBuster	6955				This administration has taken a meat cleaver out, in terms of Federal-assisted housing, and the record is there.	0
ClaimBuster	6956				And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership.	1
ClaimBuster	6957				Ours is a nation of refugees, a nation of immigrants.	1
ClaimBuster	6958				And thirdly, we need an earned-legalization program for people who have been here for a long time, stayed out of trouble, got a job, paid their taxes, and their kids are American.	0
ClaimBuster	6959				And if we can get this law changed, everybody should make the extraordinary effort to take these kids that are unwanted and sometimes aborted, take the - let them come to birth, and then put them in a family where they will be loved.	0
ClaimBuster	6960				Let's give low income parents the same right that people of power and prestige have in America and let them go to better schools.	0
ClaimBuster	6961				The first thing I'd do is, during political campaigns, I would urge everybody to stop trying to split this country into fragments and appeal to the differences between us and then wonder why the melting pot is all broken to pieces after November the 3rd.	0
ClaimBuster	6962				A $25 billion giveaway to the biggest corporations in America, including a $254 million refund check to Enron.	1
ClaimBuster	6963				It's a totally different point of view.	0
ClaimBuster	6964				The problem is that because the voucher wouldn't necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	6965				So the new world order to me means freedom and democracy, keep engaged, do not pull back into isolation.	0
ClaimBuster	6966				Because again this showed a lack of understanding of dictators, a lack of understanding particularly of Communists, because every time you make such a concession it does not lead to peace; it only encourages them to blackmail you.	0
ClaimBuster	6967				They've cut the Pell Grants and the Perkins loans to help kids be able to go to college.	1
ClaimBuster	6968				... about a potential nuclear -- nuclear competition in Asia, you said, you know, go ahead, enjoy yourselves, folks.	1
ClaimBuster	6969				Clearly, the president wants to leave in ambivalence or intends to undo it.	1
ClaimBuster	6970				The policies of the last eight years and -- and Washington's unwillingness to tackle the tough problems for decades has left us in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	6971				We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands, to the game refuges.	1
ClaimBuster	6972				I'm optimistic that we'll win the war on terror, but I understand it requires firm resolve and clear purpose.	0
ClaimBuster	6973				So racial profiling isn't just an issue at local police forces.	0
ClaimBuster	6974				But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.	1
ClaimBuster	6975				We've been strong, but we haven't been trigger-happy.	0
ClaimBuster	6976				Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing.	0
ClaimBuster	6977				The Patriot Act is vital -- is vital that the Congress renew the Patriot Act which enables our law enforcement to disrupt terror cells.	0
ClaimBuster	6978				But I'm going to be respectful for people, I'll tolerate people, and I support equal rights but not special rights for people.	0
ClaimBuster	6979				National security, economic strength, democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	6980				They don't want to go into a drug bust and be facing an AK-47.	0
ClaimBuster	6981				A guy named Michael runs the school.	1
ClaimBuster	6982				You heard what I was for.	0
ClaimBuster	6983				Now under my plan we'll balance the budget every year.	0
ClaimBuster	6984				But let's take an example that we know is going to make a difference in the 21st century and that's our education policy.	0
ClaimBuster	6985				Over 60 nations involved with disrupting the trans-shipment of information and/or weapons of mass destruction materials.	0
ClaimBuster	6986				And are you prepared to repudiate him now?	0
ClaimBuster	6987				That's just not true, John.	0
ClaimBuster	6988				What is more moral than for the United States under the Ford administration to take the lead in southern Africa, in the Middle East?	0
ClaimBuster	6989				They viewed their service as an opportunity to serve their country.	0
ClaimBuster	6990				We do not want to be the lowest of the low.	0
ClaimBuster	6991				I know nothing about Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	6992				I have never suggested a test where we turn over our security to any nation.	1
ClaimBuster	6993				Now, my old buddy, Joe, Joe the plumber, is out there.	0
ClaimBuster	6994				I guess my answer to that is the man is running on Medi-scare.	0
ClaimBuster	6995				I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it.	1
ClaimBuster	6996				Now, typically, what's happened is that there's been a debate between more money or reform, and I think we need both.	0
ClaimBuster	6997				And I wouldn't join it.	0
ClaimBuster	6998				But we can't do it if we are not willing to give Iraq back its country.	0
ClaimBuster	6999				And when it comes to education what I've said is we've got to reform schools that are not working.	1
ClaimBuster	7000				I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.	0
ClaimBuster	7001				I think it's very important that our cities know that they have a partner in the federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	7002				There are some really interesting technologies.	0
ClaimBuster	7003				Whether it's 6 or 5, but it looks like it's 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice.	1
ClaimBuster	7004				And we will help them with respect to developing their own economy, because ultimately what's going to make the Egyptian revolution successful for the people of Egypt, but also for the world, is if those young people who gathered there are seeing opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	7005				And they have said that they want to see Israel wiped off the map.	1
ClaimBuster	7006				And that's what people are seeing now is happening in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	7007				I know how to save billions of dollars in defense spending.	0
ClaimBuster	7008				What the Western allies did decide to do is to stop all air flights - commercial air flights - to any nation involved in terrorism or the hijacking of air planes, or the harboring of hijackers.	1
ClaimBuster	7009				And all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis.	0
ClaimBuster	7010				And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.	0
ClaimBuster	7011				Now, it's fine to say that sometimes you have to hit base camps, but when the president saw this state sponsored-fingerprints of Muammar Khadaffi on the loss of American life, he hit Libya.	1
ClaimBuster	7012				The platform suggests that it can be done through economic growth; that it can be done, in effect, with mirrors.	1
ClaimBuster	7013				It is also true that this has been a situation on our borders back through a number of administrations.	0
ClaimBuster	7014				And we're going to get the job of containing all of that nuclear material in Russia done in four years.	0
ClaimBuster	7015				That's how we make sure that everybody is willing to make a few sacrifices.	0
ClaimBuster	7016				Now we have a chance.	0
ClaimBuster	7017				And I'm blessed, as I think the president is blessed, as I said last time.	0
ClaimBuster	7018				That's part of what I'm fighting for as president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	7019				I believe that we have to eliminate the earmarks.	0
ClaimBuster	7020				His targeted tax cut is so detailed, so much fine print that it is going to require numerous IRS agents.	0
ClaimBuster	7021				Let's look at it as graded by the National Taxpayers Union and the Citizens Against Government Waste and the other watchdog organizations.	0
ClaimBuster	7022				The Soviet Union is making great gains.	0
ClaimBuster	7023				But let's not go back and keep assailing a farm bill that passed with overwhelming Democrat and Republican support.	1
ClaimBuster	7024				That was the second time.	1
ClaimBuster	7025				Jim, when I came home from prison, I saw our veterans being very badly treated, and it made me sad.	1
ClaimBuster	7026				I wrote to Secretary Paulson, I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, and told them this is something we have to deal with, and nobody did anything about it.	1
ClaimBuster	7027				I felt that if I could just get the parties together to say let's stop the violence, start talking, commit to the negotiations, that would be a plus.	0
ClaimBuster	7028				And so, not once, but twice - in 1971 - I voted on the floor of the House of Representatives against a Constitutional amendment that tried to bring prayer back into the public schools.	1
ClaimBuster	7029				Russia has decided that it's all in, in Syria.	1
ClaimBuster	7030				Our Navy is old -- excuse me, our Navy is smaller now than at any time since 1917.	1
ClaimBuster	7031				My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	7032				The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which generally doesn't support a lot of Democrats, said that this plan could lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system.	1
ClaimBuster	7033				And he was given a chance to vote, and he voted no.	1
ClaimBuster	7034				The Arabs have put pressure on Mr. Ford, and he's yielded, and has permitted a boycott by the Arab countries of American businesses who trade with Israel, or who have American Jews owning or taking part in the management of American - companies.	1
ClaimBuster	7035				Admit it, that Arkansas is doing very, very badly against any standard -- environment, support for police officers, whatever it is.	1
ClaimBuster	7036				And I will hunt down and kill the terrorists, wherever they are.	0
ClaimBuster	7037				But the Americans with Disabilities Act, speaking about sound and sensible civil rights legislation, was the most foremost piece of legislation passed in modern times, and so we do have something more than a technical problem.	0
ClaimBuster	7038				There are 9 countries that spend more than we do on public education.	1
ClaimBuster	7039				I'll get people back to work with 12 million new jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	7040				"The same front outfit organization that your campaign gave $832,000 for ""lighting and site selection."""	1
ClaimBuster	7041				We need to move on.	0
ClaimBuster	7042				And that's what we're going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	7043				You don't have good community relations in Chicago.	0
ClaimBuster	7044				I'm a Catholic, raised a Catholic.	1
ClaimBuster	7045				We want to end those conflicts to the extent humanly possible.	0
ClaimBuster	7046				"This is the person who, after we had -- we hadn't even finished Afghanistan, where he said, ""Next up, Baghdad."""	1
ClaimBuster	7047				Mr. Morgan, no matter how well we're doing in the cold war, we're not doing as well as we should.	0
ClaimBuster	7048				Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her -- took massive deductions.	1
ClaimBuster	7049				These are the weaknesses that I see, and I believe it's not just a matter of idealism.	0
ClaimBuster	7050				That's why when I became President I was determined to kind of move beyond this whole stale debate that had gone on in Washington for too long to get this country moving again.	0
ClaimBuster	7051				China can be our partner, but -- but that doesn't mean they can just roll all over us and steal our jobs on an unfair basis.	0
ClaimBuster	7052				In other words, trading with other countries.	0
ClaimBuster	7053				But I think they're going to see through it.	0
ClaimBuster	7054				He came to see me.	1
ClaimBuster	7055				And so, what I'm telling you is, is that sometimes in this world you make unpopular decisions because you think they're right.	0
ClaimBuster	7056				I have a feeling how they came.	0
ClaimBuster	7057				I regret to say that the president who called himself a uniter, not a divider, is now presiding over the most divided America in the recent memory of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	7058				Paul Tsongas, a liberal senator from Massachusetts said the dumbest thing I did was to oppose the capital gains cut.	1
ClaimBuster	7059				Well, I have much better judgment than she does.	0
ClaimBuster	7060				I've seen the strength of my nation, and I've seen the crises it approached in a tentative way.	0
ClaimBuster	7061				And we've got to maintain that pressure.	0
ClaimBuster	7062				Capital gains, one more point on that, please let's learn from history.	0
ClaimBuster	7063				But I was not for the bill that he was talking about because it was not tough enough on the criminal.	1
ClaimBuster	7064				The President answers that it didn't happen or, if it did, it was resolved later in a commission.	1
ClaimBuster	7065				The good news is, and I think it's true in Richmond, teenage use is down of cocaine, substantially, 60% in the last couple of years.	1
ClaimBuster	7066				Ladies and gentlemen, that's just not true what he said.	1
ClaimBuster	7067				I think the IMF has got a role in the world, but I don't want to see the IMF out there as a way to say to world bankers, if you make a bad loan, we'll bail you out.	0
ClaimBuster	7068				It hasn't worked, and we need fundamental change.	0
ClaimBuster	7069				In mine, I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society -- that they, not government, are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible, with an orderly society.	0
ClaimBuster	7070				Senator Obama, as a member of the Illinois State Senate, voted in the Judiciary Committee against a law that would provide immediate medical attention to a child born of a failed abortion.	1
ClaimBuster	7071				We are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people.	0
ClaimBuster	7072				We just heard the President's answer for the problems at the barracks in Lebanon, where 241 marines were killed.	1
ClaimBuster	7073				At home, we'll do everything we can to protect the homeland.	0
ClaimBuster	7074				Look -- look, it's not that hard to fix Social Security, Tom.	0
ClaimBuster	7075				And then I think of the older people who are retired.	0
ClaimBuster	7076				The president got $84 from a timber company that owns, and he's counted as a small business.	1
ClaimBuster	7077				You know, I am grateful to all of you for giving me the opportunity to serve you for these 4 years, and I seek reelection because I want more than anything else to try to complete the new beginning that we charted 4 years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	7078				It was the largest stock market correction -- one of the largest in history, which foretold a recession.	1
ClaimBuster	7079				They fought and won World War II.	1
ClaimBuster	7080				They have to remove themselves from South Ossetia and Abkhazia.	0
ClaimBuster	7081				We have to start treating teachers like the professionals that they are, and give them the respect and the kind of quality of life that will draw more people into teaching because we need a lot more teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	7082				I'll get America and North America energy independent.	0
ClaimBuster	7083				We have to let them know that we want to help them, not because we're simply trying to save our own skins, not because we're simply trying to fight Communism; but because we care for them, because we stand for freedom, because if there were no Communism in the world, we would still fight poverty and misery and disease and tyranny.	0
ClaimBuster	7084				But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.	0
ClaimBuster	7085				I think our generation of Americans has the same rendezvous.	0
ClaimBuster	7086				But the Russians must understand that these kinds of actions and activities are not acceptable and hopefully we will use the leverage, economic, diplomatic and others united with our allies, with our allies and friends in Europe who are equally disturbed as we are about their recent behaviors.	0
ClaimBuster	7087				And number three, we need to be a force for freedom and democracy and we need to use our unique position to support freedom, whether it's in Haiti or in China or in any other place, wherever the seeds of freedom are sprouting.	0
ClaimBuster	7088				There was a recent investigation of the number in Texas who got -- who were given concealed weapons permits in spite of the fact that they had records.	1
ClaimBuster	7089				You've got to look at our record.	0
ClaimBuster	7090				Well, listen, you ought to be in the White House for a day and hear what I hear and see what I see and read the mail I read and touch the people that I touch from time to time.	0
ClaimBuster	7091				You know, Mr. Bush was very grateful when I was among the Democrats who said he ought to have the authority to negotiate an agreement with Mexico.	1
ClaimBuster	7092				I don't know about -- we'll talk about that a little with Ross here in a bit.	0
ClaimBuster	7093				It's the route for them to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon, which threatens, of course, our ally, Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	7094				What happened was one of the Turkish, one of the Kurdish leaders invited him to go up north, but we felt since the whole world community had told him not to do it, that once he did it we had to do something.	1
ClaimBuster	7095				We cannot have it in our hearts.	0
ClaimBuster	7096				I'm not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid, or when our children go to school part-time shifts.	0
ClaimBuster	7097				The answer to your question is very simple about why I don't go to church.	0
ClaimBuster	7098				And the one thing that I'm absolutely clear about is that after a decade in which we saw drift, jobs being shipped overseas, nobody championing American workers and American businesses, we've now begun to make some real progress.	1
ClaimBuster	7099				We did not say to Saddam Hussein, Ross, you can take the northern part of Kuwait.	1
ClaimBuster	7100				I've watched him with the first lady, who I admire a great deal, and his daughters.	1
ClaimBuster	7101				My point is, is that my plan not only trusts seniors with options, my plan sets aside $3.4 trillion for Medicare over the next ten years.	1
ClaimBuster	7102				And for the next decade, she was haunted by that conversation.	0
ClaimBuster	7103				You can't have voluntary testing.	0
ClaimBuster	7104				Ones that can support a family.	0
ClaimBuster	7105				We've negotiated over 200 separate trade agreements.	1
ClaimBuster	7106				Why can't we have transparency, accountability, reform of these agencies of government?	0
ClaimBuster	7107				Anybody that's ever built a successful business will tell you you optimize, optimize, optimize after you've put something into effect.	0
ClaimBuster	7108				He raised the 30 years of experience, so let me just talk briefly about that.	1
ClaimBuster	7109				That's the enemy that attacked us.	1
ClaimBuster	7110				And we have a certain disproportionate responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	7111				That's why I object to the covert action in Nicaragua.	0
ClaimBuster	7112				That's what I want to focus on.	0
ClaimBuster	7113				I will defend Planned Parenthood.	0
ClaimBuster	7114				Didn't bring in enough nation.	0
ClaimBuster	7115				He forgets that in this same debate on the Formosa resolution, which he said he voted for - which he did - that he voted against an amendment, or was recorded against an amendment - and on this particular - or for an amendment, I should say - which passed the Senate overwhelmingly, seventy to twelve.	1
ClaimBuster	7116				First, as a legislative leader.	0
ClaimBuster	7117				So there's some bad things going on.	0
ClaimBuster	7118				Last report on new purchases, it's the lowest since 1982.	1
ClaimBuster	7119				Which system, Communism or freedom, will triumph in the next five or ten years?	0
ClaimBuster	7120				These high interest rates -- real rates that have doubled under this administration -- have had the same effect on Mexico and so on, and the cost of repaying those debts is so enormous that it results in massive unemployment, hardship, and heartache.	1
ClaimBuster	7121				You can't have an economy that over the last three years keeps slowing down its growth rate.	0
ClaimBuster	7122				I just happen to believe that free enterprise can do a better job of producing the things that people need than government can.	0
ClaimBuster	7123				My opponent calls it a mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	7124				Sure, you can do that with Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	7125				Did you say you're unemployed?	0
ClaimBuster	7126				Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and he's absolutely right.	0
ClaimBuster	7127				We've been successful in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	7128				We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege.	0
ClaimBuster	7129				Maybe the Vice President has an answer.	0
ClaimBuster	7130				Katie, it's a terrific question and we have a difficult situation in Pakistan.	0
ClaimBuster	7131				This is a group of killers who will not only kill here, but kill children in Russia, that'll attack unmercifully in Iraq, hoping to shake our will.	0
ClaimBuster	7132				I wrote about that in...	0
ClaimBuster	7133				Well, I'm a little confused here, because I don't see how you can grow the deficit down by raising people's taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	7134				And then fourthly, as a moral leader.	0
ClaimBuster	7135				I think anybody would have a hard time explaining that clearly in a way that makes sense to the average person.	0
ClaimBuster	7136				Obviously, I'm hoping to earn your vote, I'm hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.	0
ClaimBuster	7137				... who initiated -- actually, supports charters.	0
ClaimBuster	7138				He says that he voted for the resolution.	1
ClaimBuster	7139				It was a smart thing to do.	0
ClaimBuster	7140				Now, a lot of the trial lawyers didn't want me to sign any bill at all, but I had thought we ought to do what we could to cut frivolous lawsuits, but they wouldn't make some of the changes that I thought should be made.	0
ClaimBuster	7141				It is important for NATO to have it work.	0
ClaimBuster	7142				I choose education and health care, the environment and retirement security, and I ask for your support.	0
ClaimBuster	7143				We never should go back to that.	0
ClaimBuster	7144				I notice that Mr. Ford didn't comment on the uh - prisons in Chile.	0
ClaimBuster	7145				But I want to repeat, if you have a state that fully supports the law like we do in Texas, we're going to go after all crime.	0
ClaimBuster	7146				Well, Joe Biden, I think, is one of the finest public servants that has served in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	7147				Those are two hypo-rhetorical questions.	0
ClaimBuster	7148				But I also want to be sure that we don't leave people behind.	0
ClaimBuster	7149				He just brought up the tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	7150				What I have talked about, however, the kind of programs that I've talked about, in my judgment, are uh - fiscally sound.	0
ClaimBuster	7151				But we cannot continue to live on a credit card.	0
ClaimBuster	7152				I believe we can, for all intents and purposes, eliminate our dependence on Middle Eastern oil and Venezuelan oil.	0
ClaimBuster	7153				You know, I -- I don't look at my pension.	0
ClaimBuster	7154				Now you judge for yourselves whether or not that's fair.	0
ClaimBuster	7155				And the interest savings I would put right back into Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	7156				We also had to make sure that Moammar Gadhafi didn't stay there.	0
ClaimBuster	7157				Massachusetts doesn't have an enormous defense budget, but nevertheless, the governor raised taxes five different times.	1
ClaimBuster	7158				And when we sought to assault Social Security and Medicare, as the record shows we did, I think that was mean-spirited.	0
ClaimBuster	7159				John McCain is for me for president because he understands I have the right view in winning the war on terror and that my plan will succeed in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	7160				I didn't get to make a comment on this.	1
ClaimBuster	7161				As you hear from intelligence sources even today, the -- the insurgents are highly disparate.	0
ClaimBuster	7162				That's where we ought to go, and those are the programs we ought to review first.	0
ClaimBuster	7163				In fact, Senator McCain's campaign chairman's firm was a lobbyist on behalf of Fannie Mae, not me.	1
ClaimBuster	7164				I went to Yad Beshef (ph), the Holocaust museum there, to remind myself the nature of evil and why our bond with Israel will be unbreakable.	1
ClaimBuster	7165				She doesn't get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	7166				Well, some people look up figures, and some people make up figures.	0
ClaimBuster	7167				On non - nu- oh - uh - nonproliferation, in May of l975, I called for a conference of uh - nuclear suppliers.	1
ClaimBuster	7168				Let me say, if Senator Dole mentioned this, I just signed a bill that we got through Congress to increase the amount of pay increase we could give for military personnel and to make sure the pay increase this year was above the rate of inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	7169				But the point is that we have got to give people choice in America and not mandate things on them and give them the ability.	0
ClaimBuster	7170				He should have answered the first question.	0
ClaimBuster	7171				You know, he talks to the workers.	1
ClaimBuster	7172				Now we've been hurt in recent years in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	7173				We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations.	1
ClaimBuster	7174				And I can only tell him that we reduced, in proportion of other states, the per capita spending, the per capita size of Government - we only increased the size of Government one-twelfth what it had increased in the preceding eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	7175				And that means strong oversight, making sure that investors, taxpayers are getting their money back and treated as investors.	0
ClaimBuster	7176				That's one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank.	1
ClaimBuster	7177				And we've got a wide array of differences on those.	0
ClaimBuster	7178				So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country.	1
ClaimBuster	7179				We need a strong economy.	0
ClaimBuster	7180				Some people who say the word reform actually mean cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	7181				If you take the tax cut that the president of the United States has given -- President Bush gave to Americans in the top 1 percent of America -- just that tax cut that went to the top 1 percent of America would have saved Social Security until the year 2075.	1
ClaimBuster	7182				I made that clear when I came into office.	1
ClaimBuster	7183				Mosul is a Sunni city.	1
ClaimBuster	7184				But I don't know of any reputable scientist who believed that this system, at least as originally conceived could possibly work, this notion of some kind of astrodome over ourselves that could protect us from enemy attack.	1
ClaimBuster	7185				But let me go a step further.	0
ClaimBuster	7186				But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad, and by the way -- and by Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	7187				He has never supported any of those arms control agreements - the limited test ban, SALT I, nor the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford - and now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the Soviet Union, negotiated over a seven-year period, by myself and my two Republican predecessors.	1
ClaimBuster	7188				They're putting people out of business, men and women.	0
ClaimBuster	7189				Now with respect to what we've done with China already, U.S. exports have doubled since I came into office, to China and actually currencies are at their most advantageous point for U.S. exporters since 1993.	1
ClaimBuster	7190				We cannot solve this problem all on our own.	0
ClaimBuster	7191				So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.	1
ClaimBuster	7192				I believe we could have done better.	0
ClaimBuster	7193				And in fact, employers are looking for skilled workers.	0
ClaimBuster	7194				But in order to be able to fulfill our role in the world, America must be strong.	0
ClaimBuster	7195				And that's what my campaign is about and I'm not going to raise taxes the way Senator Obama wants to raise taxes in a tough economy.	0
ClaimBuster	7196				One, could our family endure all this business.	0
ClaimBuster	7197				Not just a state problem.	0
ClaimBuster	7198				And I make that point because that's the kind of clarity of leadership, and those decisions are not always popular.	1
ClaimBuster	7199				The governor also talks about morality in foreign policy.	1
ClaimBuster	7200				I believe that the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries because those businesses trade with Israel or because they have American Jews who are owners or directors in the company is an absolute disgrace.	0
ClaimBuster	7201				I promised that we would reduce taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	7202				Forty-seven million Americans are without health insurance in America today.	1
ClaimBuster	7203				I have no idea what you're talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	7204				I choose Blue Cross/Blue Shield.	1
ClaimBuster	7205				In Egypt we stood on the side of democracy.	1
ClaimBuster	7206				They really don't - they're not able to control their market very well.	0
ClaimBuster	7207				In addition, I'm going to double the number of Special Forces so that we can fight a more effective war on terror, with less pressure on the National Guard and Reserve.	0
ClaimBuster	7208				But I know more about this, I think, than anybody else up here because I have a brother who's a recovering drug addict.	1
ClaimBuster	7209				I will fight for middle-class families and working men and women and I will never let you down.	0
ClaimBuster	7210				I talked in our first debate about the possibilities of helping millions and millions of welfare families to get off of welfare, and I'm proud to say that we finally have a welfare reform bill And the Ruby Samsons and Dan Lawsons, hundreds of thousands of welfare mothers in this country and in my state and across the country who today are working and earning are examples of what can happen when you provide training to those welfare mothers, some daycare for their children so that those mothers can go into a training program and get a decent job.	1
ClaimBuster	7211				For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.	1
ClaimBuster	7212				So I would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on federal spending.	0
ClaimBuster	7213				He has already weighed in and helped stabilize some of the difficulties in the markets and with companies and corporations, institutions today.	1
ClaimBuster	7214				I think they saw weakness where they had expected to find American strength.	0
ClaimBuster	7215				If we build our economy the way we should, we can afford to do these things and we must do it.	0
ClaimBuster	7216				You also have investments in Chinese companies.	1
ClaimBuster	7217				If we fail then we must meet our responsibilities to ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	7218				Andrea, I don't know which George Bush I'm listening to.	0
ClaimBuster	7219				We agreed to train and arm the Muslims so they could defend themselves, the policy you had when you ran in 1992.	1
ClaimBuster	7220				"I was chairman of ""Minnesotans for Kennedy;'' President Reagan was chairman of a thing called ""Democrats for Nixon.''"	1
ClaimBuster	7221				And secondly, like my opponent, I don't agree we ought to have quotas.	0
ClaimBuster	7222				So we want to end discrimination.	0
ClaimBuster	7223				They're not taken care of.	0
ClaimBuster	7224				And it is a threat not only in this region but around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	7225				If President Brezhnev said, we will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American Presidents over a seven-year period of time, we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations, and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations, it's obvious that I, as President, and all Americans, would reject such a proposition.	0
ClaimBuster	7226				He said it would hurt the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	7227				My fellow Americans, as you heard from Bob Schieffer a moment ago, America is being tested by division.	1
ClaimBuster	7228				I would be guarded in my approach.	0
ClaimBuster	7229				Go back to the time he was, what, Texas director for George McGovern.	1
ClaimBuster	7230				I support it for the middle class, not that part of it that goes to people earning more than $200,000 a year.	0
ClaimBuster	7231				We have to have wind, tide, solar, natural gas, flex fuel cars and all that but we also have to have offshore drilling and we also have to have nuclear power.	0
ClaimBuster	7232				And the nuclear capability has been searched by the United Nations, and there hasn't been one single scintilla of evidence that there's any US technology involved in it.	1
ClaimBuster	7233				And Iran is killing ISIS.	1
ClaimBuster	7234				I would have hoped that it would have been possible to use marshals to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	7235				I am opposed to it.	0
ClaimBuster	7236				It's one of these deals where, in order to be popular in the halls of Europe, you sign a treaty.	0
ClaimBuster	7237				It's a big mistake to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	7238				You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	7239				I looked the other night.	0
ClaimBuster	7240				I have my own plan.	0
ClaimBuster	7241				So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.	1
ClaimBuster	7242				He is the one who has gotten us that first arms control agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	7243				I've already taken the pledge on cutting the deficit in half.	1
ClaimBuster	7244				And now you've got a choice.	0
ClaimBuster	7245				Now, we have just heard two or three times from the vice president: he's not going to raise taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	7246				"Take a look at the ""start up"" that they signed."	0
ClaimBuster	7247				Maybe to Senator Obama it's not a lot of money.	0
ClaimBuster	7248				And let's talk about people we do control.	0
ClaimBuster	7249				As a matter of fact, Latin America's economy is almost as big as the economy of China.	1
ClaimBuster	7250				This is an issue that -- look, it divides us.	0
ClaimBuster	7251				He made a mistake in invading Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	7252				Now we have a majority and we get a president.	1
ClaimBuster	7253				It's a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	7254				If you want me to be your president, we're going to face our problems.	0
ClaimBuster	7255				I mean, we agree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	7256				The so-called negotiation that you said I walked out on was the so-called walk in the woods between one of our representatives and one of the Soviet Union, and it wasn't me that turned it down, the Soviet Union disavowed it.	1
ClaimBuster	7257				It's not as big as yours so it doesn't take as long.	0
ClaimBuster	7258				If they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center.	0
ClaimBuster	7259				Last week, as you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report.	1
ClaimBuster	7260				We can do better in our public schools.	0
ClaimBuster	7261				They -- they say, if a patient's coming in, let's get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests.	1
ClaimBuster	7262				I would never single out food as a trade embargo item.	0
ClaimBuster	7263				We have the biggest drop in the number of people in poverty in 27 years.	1
ClaimBuster	7264				If you want to purchase health insurance, you will get help with that.	0
ClaimBuster	7265				This is indeed a very important issue.	0
ClaimBuster	7266				And, believe me, anybody that knows me understands I have a very low tolerance for non-performance also.	0
ClaimBuster	7267				They told you at the tax and budget summit that if you agreed to a tax increase, we could balance the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	7268				Many of the military experts whom I consulted on this agreed.	1
ClaimBuster	7269				Senator Obama refuses to acknowledge that we are winning in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	7270				I'm not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	7271				I know what it takes to balance budgets.	0
ClaimBuster	7272				The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	7273				I went and I volunteered, and I went to Vietnam.	1
ClaimBuster	7274				I never said any such thing.	1
ClaimBuster	7275				The European countries have a stake in not having total disorder on their doorstep.	0
ClaimBuster	7276				She doesn't do anything about anything other than talk.	0
ClaimBuster	7277				Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis.	1
ClaimBuster	7278				So I think it's worth a shot.	0
ClaimBuster	7279				I want to give small business employers a tax credit, 25%, to encourage the providing of health insurance for the employees in small businesses.	0
ClaimBuster	7280				That's what we will do.	0
ClaimBuster	7281				I think our seniors deserve a modern medical system.	0
ClaimBuster	7282				We can further the cause of equality in our nation.	0
ClaimBuster	7283				Well, thank you very much, Bob, Governor Romney, and to Lynn University.	0
ClaimBuster	7284				You just give me a job.	0
ClaimBuster	7285				That's why I think we shouldn't do it that quickly.	0
ClaimBuster	7286				The fact of the matter is...	0
ClaimBuster	7287				We have too much polling and focus groups going on in Washington today.	0
ClaimBuster	7288				We're not talking about third-world drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	7289				In the second quarter, we had dropped it down to about 13%.	1
ClaimBuster	7290				Everything is a gift from the Almighty.	0
ClaimBuster	7291				In other words, we were down to 18% of them were making -- 18- to 24-year- olds were making less than $12,000.	1
ClaimBuster	7292				I've stood up against it as secretary of state.	1
ClaimBuster	7293				We've got a society that says hey, the status quo is fine, just move them through.	0
ClaimBuster	7294				And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	7295				At that time, uh - 25 or 30 percent of the Reagan supporters said that they would not support President Ford.	1
ClaimBuster	7296				I've been waiting for years.	0
ClaimBuster	7297				And I don't intend ever to express regrets to Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else if I'm doing something that has the support of the Congress and that is right for the purpose of protecting the security of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	7298				I would hate to be running for president and think that the only way I could win would be to convince everybody how horrible things are.	0
ClaimBuster	7299				Uh - I would also suggest that insofar as his statement is concerned, that I think it would be improper for the President of the United States to disclose uh - the instances in which members of his official family had made recommendations, as I have made them through the years to him, which he has accepted or rejected.	0
ClaimBuster	7300				"And we'll get you home as soon as the mission's done, because this is a vital mission."""	0
ClaimBuster	7301				But I do think we ought to have a cohesive economic policy with at - at least the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and the president's terms being uh - the same and letting the Congress, of course, be the third uh - entity with uh - with independence subject only to the president's veto.	0
ClaimBuster	7302				The fact is that the president is driving the largest deficits in American history.	1
ClaimBuster	7303				My grandmother, she started off as a secretary in a bank.	1
ClaimBuster	7304				But we're also going to have to look at, how is it that we shredded so many regulations?	0
ClaimBuster	7305				They would have gone through a...	0
ClaimBuster	7306				The other point that I would make with regard to economic assistance and technical assistance is that the United States must not rest its case here alone.	0
ClaimBuster	7307				And the test is not whether you're spending more money.	0
ClaimBuster	7308				And it's not my money.	0
ClaimBuster	7309				I apologize, Mr. Vice President.	0
ClaimBuster	7310				We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.	0
ClaimBuster	7311				I have had it in every single proposal I've sent to the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	7312				There are limits to this nation's ability to finance these weapons systems.	0
ClaimBuster	7313				So we want to promote those principles around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	7314				You've got every rich Middle Eastern country over there trying to buy nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	7315				And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	7316				And an Iranian nuclear program is not acceptable to us.	0
ClaimBuster	7317				And it's really a shame.	0
ClaimBuster	7318				Look what's happening in Syria, in Egypt, now in Libya.	0
ClaimBuster	7319				Look, I look at what's happening around the world, and i see Iran four years closer to a bomb.	0
ClaimBuster	7320				Well, anybody that thinks about it cares a great deal.	0
ClaimBuster	7321				That's what worries me --	0
ClaimBuster	7322				And we are winning in Iraq, and we will come home.	0
ClaimBuster	7323				I don't believe it is.	0
ClaimBuster	7324				So that's one reason I don't want it.	0
ClaimBuster	7325				And that's one of the reasons I've said before, and I'll pledge here tonight, if I'm president, the very first bill that Joe Lieberman and I will send to the United States Congress is the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill.	0
ClaimBuster	7326				I think after three debates the good people of this country understand there is a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	7327				That would be my position.	0
ClaimBuster	7328				But when there's uh - a very narrow decision - which quite often there's one that reaches the Supreme Court - I think the choice should be with human rights.	0
ClaimBuster	7329				For example, we have reduced the size of the Federal government to its smallest size in 30 years.	1
ClaimBuster	7330				And what we have in Lebanon is something that the American people have seen.	0
ClaimBuster	7331				That was, of course, out-of-bounds by the Democrats.	0
ClaimBuster	7332				And I've had to deal with those crises as best I could.	0
ClaimBuster	7333				Now, having that, I think also that in leadership -- well, I believe that you find people, positions such as I'm in who have the talent and ability to do the things that are needed in the various departments of government.	0
ClaimBuster	7334				I think if the United States is maintaining a strong society here in the United States, I think that we can meet any internal threat.	0
ClaimBuster	7335				OK, what -- what would I cut?	0
ClaimBuster	7336				On Iran, I hope we can do the same thing, continue to work with the world to convince the Iranian mullahs to abandon their nuclear ambitions.	0
ClaimBuster	7337				I've got a plan to increase the wetlands by 3 million.	0
ClaimBuster	7338				And to make health care more affordable, allow business associations like the National Federal of Independent Business or the Chamber of Commerce or the National Restaurant Association to write association plans across jurisdictional lines so that small businesses have got the capacity to have national pooling to drive the cost of insurance down.	1
ClaimBuster	7339				This is the administration that fought the balanced budget amendment and vetoed a balanced budget and vetoed welfare reform twice, and the list goes on and on and on, that's what I had in mind.	1
ClaimBuster	7340				It must be a test of a man.	0
ClaimBuster	7341				His leading advisor on this plan actually said that would be okay, because then the Social Security Trust Fund could start borrowing.	1
ClaimBuster	7342				That's how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	7343				There was two or three commission reports, recommendations by the CIA, the State Department, and the others, and the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves.	1
ClaimBuster	7344				And it was so far back, it was considered so odd, and even though we were a tiny, little company at the time, it made all the national magazines.	1
ClaimBuster	7345				The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	7346				The third thing we have to do is we've got to make sure that we're competing in education.	0
ClaimBuster	7347				I know what a hate crime statute pending at the national level is all about in the aftermath of James Byrd's death.	1
ClaimBuster	7348				And a young man is out there on a $1 billion carrier in charge of the maintenance of a $20 million aircraft, working 100 hours a week at times, and he's earning less for himself and his family, while he's away from his family, than he could earn if he were in one of the most menial jobs, working 40 hours a week here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	7349				Anybody else can run the middle class down and run the economy in a ditch.	0
ClaimBuster	7350				You know, nobody likes who shot John, but I think the first negative campaign run in this election was by Governor Clinton, and I'm not going to sit there and be a punching bag; I'm going to stand up and say, hey, listen, here's my side of it.	0
ClaimBuster	7351				It's been a very tough campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	7352				And we need to strengthen the American family.	0
ClaimBuster	7353				And let me say this.	0
ClaimBuster	7354				What are low paying jobs?	0
ClaimBuster	7355				So, I can say there are a great many interests.	0
ClaimBuster	7356				I also want to thank the University of Mississippi for hosting us tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	7357				I see a day in the United States of America where all of our public schools are considered excellent, world class.	0
ClaimBuster	7358				Now, I'm going to reverse that.	0
ClaimBuster	7359				The president's policies have been exercised over the last four years and they haven't put Americans back to work.	1
ClaimBuster	7360				He even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he -- you know, he wasn't sure whether they were aligned with us.	1
ClaimBuster	7361				In my opinion they're going to be de- be greater.	0
ClaimBuster	7362				And a lot of them, as you say, Candy, have been out of work for a long, long, long time.	0
ClaimBuster	7363				Well, 88 percent of the people -- the President claims 11 million are already covered and only 5 percent -- keep in mind only 5 percent of the employers are affected by the Family Leave Act.	1
ClaimBuster	7364				Number two, we've got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years.	1
ClaimBuster	7365				does, which is bulk purchase drugs so that you can lower the price and get them out to you lower.	0
ClaimBuster	7366				And by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	7367				I think our relationships with China are important and I don't want to isolate China, but I think it is a mistake for us to do what this Administration did when all those kids went out there carrying the Statue of Liberty in Tiananmen Square.	0
ClaimBuster	7368				The fact is that there have been markets shut to us that we haven't stood up and fought for.	1
ClaimBuster	7369				It was a nation building mission, and it was not very successful.	1
ClaimBuster	7370				Well, I'm really encouraged to know of your renewed friendship with Al D'Amato, and I know he appreciates it.	0
ClaimBuster	7371				-- me, or your own eyes?''	0
ClaimBuster	7372				I'm lowering taxes actually, because I think it's so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving -- massive corporations and little ones, little ones can't form.	1
ClaimBuster	7373				Unfortunately, they left the money behind for No Child Left Behind.	0
ClaimBuster	7374				We have to move into those areas with programs so that we make adequate use of the resources of those areas.	0
ClaimBuster	7375				I'd like to be that leader with your support.	0
ClaimBuster	7376				I do not favor abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	7377				Senator Obama wants government to do the job.	0
ClaimBuster	7378				So I ask you to look at that.	0
ClaimBuster	7379				Well, it's the civil rights issue of the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	7380				And a senator from Connecticut stood up to him named Prescott Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	7381				That's another reason to get the deficit down.	0
ClaimBuster	7382				I deal with them all the time.	1
ClaimBuster	7383				I thought that was a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	7384				Well, on campaign reform itself, we're going to get it when we have a bipartisan commission, take it out of politics.	0
ClaimBuster	7385				It comes out of a general fund, but something should be done about it.	1
ClaimBuster	7386				And I am disappointed that Secretary Paulson and others have not made that their first priority.	0
ClaimBuster	7387				Mr. Movers, President Carter was not right a few weeks ago when he said that the American people were confronted with only two choices, with only two men, and with only two parties.	0
ClaimBuster	7388				And that's why it's so critical, that we make America once again the most attractive place in the world to start businesses, to build jobs, to grow the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	7389				The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level.	1
ClaimBuster	7390				And I said, well, how does it stop being disruptive?	0
ClaimBuster	7391				Two points I think are important to think about when it comes to Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	7392				We've got people watching tonight and listening tonight trying to find the truth.	0
ClaimBuster	7393				"So, for example, on wind energy, when Governor Romney says ""these are imaginary jobs."""	0
ClaimBuster	7394				And now I suggest that maybe you go to some of these organizations that are the watchdogs of what we do, like the Citizens Against Government Waste or the National Taxpayers Union or these other organizations that watch us all the time.	1
ClaimBuster	7395				As to the drug itself, I mentioned I was disappointed.	0
ClaimBuster	7396				I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work.	0
ClaimBuster	7397				And I've been given a lot -- a lot of credit for it.	1
ClaimBuster	7398				The George Bush who was the charter member of the environmental wrecking crew that went to Washington in the early '80s and did a job on the EPA, or the one we've been seeing and listening to the past two or three months.	1
ClaimBuster	7399				I hope as president that I've earned your trust.	0
ClaimBuster	7400				And I know that we did give back authority and autonomy to the people.	0
ClaimBuster	7401				We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in Medicare and Medicaid... 	0
ClaimBuster	7402				And that is something that I would welcome.	0
ClaimBuster	7403				There is a huge difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	7404				He can buy insurance cheaper than Mom and Pop's store on the corner.	1
ClaimBuster	7405				I happen to support that.	1
ClaimBuster	7406				And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going.	0
ClaimBuster	7407				And we can do it.	0
ClaimBuster	7408				Japan will be hosting a summit.	1
ClaimBuster	7409				And those principles include human rights, human dignity, free enterprise, freedom of expression, elections.	1
ClaimBuster	7410				I understand the importance of time but see, here's how we get to this mess we're in.	0
ClaimBuster	7411				I believe, when an international body speaks, it must mean what it says.	0
ClaimBuster	7412				And I beat back the Congress on that, and then we passed a decent civil rights bill that offers guarantees against discrimination in employment.	1
ClaimBuster	7413				I like those ratings systems.	0
ClaimBuster	7414				Because the president cut in half the number of licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands, and in federal waters.	1
ClaimBuster	7415				The proof of that is we've gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps.	1
ClaimBuster	7416				Now there's a record: Ten and a half million more jobs, rising incomes, falling crime rates and welfare rolls, a strong America at peace.	1
ClaimBuster	7417				That is my position on SDI and it's never wavered a bit.	1
ClaimBuster	7418				I want people all over the world to look to the United States again, to feel that we're on the move, to feel that our high noon is in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	7419				They're using text books that are 10 years old.	1
ClaimBuster	7420				Yes, I want to reduce our deficit by cutting spending that we don't need but also by asking the wealthy to do a little bit more so that we can invest in things like research and technology that are the key to a 21st century economy.	0
ClaimBuster	7421				He also reads all kinds of things into my tax plan and into my Medicare plan.	0
ClaimBuster	7422				And I think that those men and women in those agencies are doing a great job.	0
ClaimBuster	7423				But we've got to get help from the Congress in order to do this.	0
ClaimBuster	7424				I think we've got to have fiscal restraint.	0
ClaimBuster	7425				They were told: Don't even bother; we're not going to listen to it.	0
ClaimBuster	7426				One of the major errors they made was the one that led to the Korean War.	1
ClaimBuster	7427				They need to be tightened.	0
ClaimBuster	7428				Why did the President feel this was wrong and why was the President right and his critics wrong?	0
ClaimBuster	7429				The President just said that his government is shrinking.	1
ClaimBuster	7430				And you have to do that by beginning to not back off of the Fallujahs and other places, and send the wrong message to the terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	7431				And also the private sector ought to be encouraged to - to bring forward to the public the benefits from efficiency.	0
ClaimBuster	7432				And back then, we intercepted a suitcase in a Middle Eastern country with nuclear materials in it.	1
ClaimBuster	7433				And I think that we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way that allows us to get some additional oil.	0
ClaimBuster	7434				And it's named after this amazing woman who had been doing the same job as a man for years, found out that she was getting paid less, and the Supreme Court said that she couldn't bring suit because she should have found about it earlier, whereas she had no way of finding out about it.	1
ClaimBuster	7435				Because China has an interest in the outcome, too.	0
ClaimBuster	7436				A President must know these things.	0
ClaimBuster	7437				Mr. Carter, I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families.	0
ClaimBuster	7438				Like it or not, we are now -- the United States is now the natural leader of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	7439				And I remember you gave a very good answer to New Hampshire about the White Mountains, about how it was important to keep that collaborative effort in place.	1
ClaimBuster	7440				Absolutely, because that was a fight that needed to be had.	0
ClaimBuster	7441				This is a Main Street tax cut, 15 percent across -- let's take a family making $30,000 a year, that's $1261.	1
ClaimBuster	7442				It was ignored in that case and it was a very very serious mistake in judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	7443				Because we're able to draw on the wisdom and experience from different parts of the society that hadn't been tapped in the same way before.	0
ClaimBuster	7444				I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less.	1
ClaimBuster	7445				We invented the auto industry and the fact that we have fallen so far behind is something that we have to work on.	1
ClaimBuster	7446				They used those weapons against -- against their own citizens and killed Americans with them.	1
ClaimBuster	7447				Charlie, thank you, and thank our panelists.	0
ClaimBuster	7448				And that's what we ought to do for all people in America.	0
ClaimBuster	7449				Similarly, in Central America: What we're doing in Nicaragua with this covert war -- which the Congress, including many Republicans, have tried to stop -- is finally end up with a public definition of American power that hurts us, where we get associated with political assassins and the rest.	0
ClaimBuster	7450				The thing that I am in this race for is to tap the American people on the shoulder and to say to every single one of you, fix it while we're still relatively strong.	0
ClaimBuster	7451				And it wasn't until former Secretary of State Jim Baker and General Scowcroft and others pushed publicly and said you've got to go to the U.N., that the president finally changed his mind -- his campaign has a word for that -- and went to the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	7452				We saw the same thing in Lebanon, where we spent a good deal of America's assets.	1
ClaimBuster	7453				I think that's been proven.	1
ClaimBuster	7454				Thank you very much, Chris.	0
ClaimBuster	7455				Under Governor Bush's plan, they would get not one penny for four to five years and then they would be forced to go into an HMO or to an insurance company and ask them for coverage, but there would be no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the terms and conditions.	1
ClaimBuster	7456				What I've said is I won't put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	7457				He went over to say we must make the very changes they're making now.	0
ClaimBuster	7458				Now, my opponent says he's going to try to change the dynamics on the ground.	1
ClaimBuster	7459				The bad news is we lost.	0
ClaimBuster	7460				Between the World Trade Center bombing in, what was it, 1993 or so, and the next time was five years, seven years.	1
ClaimBuster	7461				"So I think even he has learned that you can't say ""read my lips"" because you can't know what emergencies might come up."	0
ClaimBuster	7462				If we tried everything else, if we have allies.	0
ClaimBuster	7463				I want this nation to protect its air, its water, its land, and its public health.	0
ClaimBuster	7464				He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war.	1
ClaimBuster	7465				Ross gave a good answer but I've got to respond directly to Mr. Bush.	0
ClaimBuster	7466				I don't favor equal results, but I do favor making sure everybody has a chance to prove they're competent.	0
ClaimBuster	7467				You know, we have to be right 100 percent of the time.	0
ClaimBuster	7468				And she was forced to apologize.	1
ClaimBuster	7469				Barbara, you've asked that question twice.	1
ClaimBuster	7470				I don't ever want to see another generation of young Americans bleed their lives into sandy beachheads in the Pacific, or rice paddies and jungles in the in Asia or the muddy battlefields of Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	7471				If we cut the capital gains rate, I'm told everyday, I had a letter from a former constituent in Kansas saying I want to sell property in California, put it in my business in Kansas, I can't, because the capital gains rate's too high.	1
ClaimBuster	7472				Now remember, Social Security revenue exceeds expenses up until 2015.	1
ClaimBuster	7473				We are spending now 37 percent more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980.	1
ClaimBuster	7474				I don't think this nation is composed of people who care only for themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	7475				So I get the last question -- last answer --	0
ClaimBuster	7476				Step one, the American people send me up there, the day after election, I'll get with congressional--we won't even wait till inauguration, and I'll ask the president to help me and I'll ask his staff to help me.	0
ClaimBuster	7477				I disagree with the tax-and-spend philosophy.	0
ClaimBuster	7478				We are cutting off the significant items that the Cuban regime needs in order to survive.	0
ClaimBuster	7479				You need about, according to Congressional committees on this, you need about $10 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	7480				It's as good as any private school in the country.	0
ClaimBuster	7481				You have to close the borders.	0
ClaimBuster	7482				Nuclear power: There were 36 power plants planned in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	7483				We need a good strong economic package, let the private sector creates the jobs and they can do it.	0
ClaimBuster	7484				Uh - I remember when uh - Herbert Hoover was against uh - jobs for people.	1
ClaimBuster	7485				But it seems to me the president shouldn't have any comment at all.	0
ClaimBuster	7486				Where possible, I want to give power back to the states and back to the people.	0
ClaimBuster	7487				We ought to cut the growth to twice the rate of inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	7488				We're on the hunt after Osama bin Laden.	1
ClaimBuster	7489				Why haven't they done it in seven years?	0
ClaimBuster	7490				We're not going to rest and not going to be happy until every person in this country who wants a job can have one, until the recovery is complete across the country.	0
ClaimBuster	7491				And I don't believe -- I believe, I should say, as Lincoln once said, that I could not -- I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others.	0
ClaimBuster	7492				I think that, with respect to housing, when we are consuming, even though our per capita income today is about the same as that of the Federal Republic of Germany, we are consuming about, by a factor of two, the amount of energy that they consume in that country.	1
ClaimBuster	7493				The three men who murdered James Byrd, guess what's going to happen to them?	0
ClaimBuster	7494				Let me answer what he just said, about around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	7495				Embryonic stem-cell research requires the destruction of life to create a stem cell.	1
ClaimBuster	7496				Yes, I've got scars to show for being around education reform.	0
ClaimBuster	7497				And while they were coming down, the deficits had started their great increase.	0
ClaimBuster	7498				I want to cut spending.	0
ClaimBuster	7499				My proposal gives $10,000 hiring bonuses for those teachers who are -- who get certified to teach in the areas where they're most needed.	1
ClaimBuster	7500				When we re-engaged -- because, again, the Bush administration reversed course on this -- then we have at least made some progress, although right now, because of the problems in North Korea, we are seeing it on shaky ground.	1
ClaimBuster	7501				No, it's going to totally help you.	0
ClaimBuster	7502				He said Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq as an excuse to spread hatred for America.	1
ClaimBuster	7503				Well, let me just say quickly that I've had an extraordinary experience of watching up close and personal that transition in Russia, because I was there right after the transformation.	1
ClaimBuster	7504				Iran is taking over Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	7505				We are mobilizing humanitarian support, and support for the opposition.	1
ClaimBuster	7506				My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you're willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community.	0
ClaimBuster	7507				Now this does not include uh - any uh - uh extra control over uh unnecessary spending, the weeding out of obsolete or obsolescent programs.	0
ClaimBuster	7508				It's going to help people across the country that are unemployed right now.	0
ClaimBuster	7509				There are some very fundamental differences in this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	7510				We can't have the industries of tomorrow unless we have the best educated workforce.	0
ClaimBuster	7511				And right now, they're in 32 countries.	1
ClaimBuster	7512				You say, how can I get Congress to do that?	0
ClaimBuster	7513				But it's going to take a president who's committed to housing, who's had experience in building and rehabilitating housing who understands that affordable housing for families of low and moderate income, for young families, first time home buyers, is an essential part of the American dream.	0
ClaimBuster	7514				We had a recession in fifty-eight.	1
ClaimBuster	7515				And hopefully tonight when we conclude this debate you will have a better understanding and the viewing and listening audience will have a better understanding.	0
ClaimBuster	7516				And, finally, Medicaid to states?	0
ClaimBuster	7517				They tried it with Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and John Kennedy.	1
ClaimBuster	7518				But if you calculated that unemployment rate, taking back the people who dropped out of the workforce, it would be 10.7 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	7519				I am part of an administration that has the finest record on diversity.	1
ClaimBuster	7520				And why don't we offer incentives for business and industry to start up in those zones?	0
ClaimBuster	7521				Sure, absolutely, so long as they're based upon science and they're reasonable.	0
ClaimBuster	7522				How about the growth of the economy?	0
ClaimBuster	7523				And the next president has to make sure that the next Treasury secretary is thinking about how to strengthen you as a home buyer, you as a homeowner, and not simply think about bailing out banks on Wall Street.	0
ClaimBuster	7524				It calls for more of the same.	0
ClaimBuster	7525				I have a plan to have a summit with all of the allies, something this president has not yet achieved, not yet been able to do to bring people to the table.	1
ClaimBuster	7526				And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are.	0
ClaimBuster	7527				It's important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest.	0
ClaimBuster	7528				I've named four supreme court justices in the State of Texas and would ask the people to check out their qualifications, their deliberations.	1
ClaimBuster	7529				Secondly the difference is we need to explore at home.	0
ClaimBuster	7530				If I knew of three new weapons systems that I thought were purely waste and weren't protected by the Congress, they wouldn't be in the budget.	0
ClaimBuster	7531				The first thing we did was to streamline the legal immigration system, to reduce the backlog, make it easier, simpler and cheaper for people who are waiting in line, obeying the law to make sure that they can come here and contribute to our country and that's good for our economic growth.	1
ClaimBuster	7532				So more debt and less jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	7533				Cutting 500,000 kids from after-school programs, cutting 365,000 kids from health care, running up the biggest deficits in American history.	1
ClaimBuster	7534				And here we have a very strong program going forward in the Department of Commerce.	1
ClaimBuster	7535				Because I think you see, I am one who I get kidded by being a little old fashioned on these things, but I do believe in public service.	0
ClaimBuster	7536				We must not build up the hopes of the world and then dash them as was the case in Paris.	0
ClaimBuster	7537				We're now spending 42 percent of our economy on government.	1
ClaimBuster	7538				On July twelfth of this year, we gave full permission for the release of that report.	1
ClaimBuster	7539				The Soviet Union, to our surprise -- and not just mine -- made it plain when we brought this up that they placed, they thought, a greater reliance on the land-based missiles and, therefore, they wanted to take up all three.	1
ClaimBuster	7540				And he rushed the war in Iraq without a plan to win the peace.	1
ClaimBuster	7541				So these are people that push gays off business -- off buildings.	1
ClaimBuster	7542				Now, if you want to go to the core problem that faces everybody in manufacturing in this country, it's that agreement that's about to be put into practice.	0
ClaimBuster	7543				Hey, I'll answer the question.	0
ClaimBuster	7544				I want to talk about your responsibility, and your responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	7545				We're going to protect Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	7546				So you really owe him an apology.	0
ClaimBuster	7547				I'd like to see it expanded in two ways.	0
ClaimBuster	7548				Jim, Jim, this is a big...	0
ClaimBuster	7549				At the rate that the president is currently securing it, it'll take 13 years to get it.	0
ClaimBuster	7550				I offer a new direction.	0
ClaimBuster	7551				It's just a tragedy in a nation so prosperous as ours, that the last four years have been so hard.	0
ClaimBuster	7552				But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true.	1
ClaimBuster	7553				And you knew that if the Russians themselves were trying to obtain some of these territories or push back against Georgia, that that was not a stable situation.	0
ClaimBuster	7554				And if it won't come down, the economy's going to slow down, maybe go into a recession.	0
ClaimBuster	7555				You obviously studied up on -- on my plan.	0
ClaimBuster	7556				He said we cut Pell Grants.	1
ClaimBuster	7557				We washed our hands of Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	7558				I do not want to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	7559				So there's no economist that can say Mitt Romney's tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan.	0
ClaimBuster	7560				The administration, seems like we're having a great love fest tonight, but the administration made the right decision on training Nigerian troops for situations just such as this in Rwanda, and so I thought they made the right decision not to send U.S. troops into Rwanda.	0
ClaimBuster	7561				I really don't have -- haven't picked anybody yet.	0
ClaimBuster	7562				But let me talk about what's really important for the worker you're referring to.	0
ClaimBuster	7563				She used the power of her office to make a lot of money.	1
ClaimBuster	7564				And I also agree that most police officers, of course, are doing a good job and hate this practice also.	0
ClaimBuster	7565				Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money.	1
ClaimBuster	7566				We are going to have to deal with energy because we can't keep on borrowing from the Chinese and sending money to Saudi Arabia.	0
ClaimBuster	7567				We let families save in an IRA, withdraw tax free to pay for the cost of education and it's all paid for.	1
ClaimBuster	7568				I think that's an example of a judge allowing personal opinion to enter into the decision-making process as opposed to a strict interpretation of the Constitution.	0
ClaimBuster	7569				I decided to go there myself.	0
ClaimBuster	7570				I remember being in a high school in my own state as we were organizing something we call the Governor's Alliance Against Drugs, and a young 16 year old girl coming up to me, desperate, addicted, dependent, saying, Governor, I need help.	1
ClaimBuster	7571				I can't go into detail about them here.	0
ClaimBuster	7572				And I'd have taken it out to the country and I'd have had every law enforcement officer in the country visit those congressmen.	1
ClaimBuster	7573				Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever.	1
ClaimBuster	7574				In addition we uh - in the federal government make available to uh - cities about uh - three billion three hundred million dollars in what we call community development.	1
ClaimBuster	7575				Over $60 million at least will go into this campaign to leave the American dream to you and your children, to get this country straightened out, because if anybody owes it to you, I do.	1
ClaimBuster	7576				Under Vice President Gore's plan, he is going to grow the federal government in the largest increase since Lyndon Baines Johnson in 1965.	1
ClaimBuster	7577				If that child were here today, and I was told the same thing, my granddaughter, Noel for example that child could stay alive for ten or fifteen years, or maybe for the rest of her life.	0
ClaimBuster	7578				I know how to make that happen.	0
ClaimBuster	7579				They know what it's like not to have family leave or childcare.	1
ClaimBuster	7580				There is no doubt about it.	0
ClaimBuster	7581				I think you have to have greater oil and gas production, more coal production, more nuclear production, and in addition you have to have energy conservation.	0
ClaimBuster	7582				This -- we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	7583				We've been very successful in both cases.	0
ClaimBuster	7584				"[Laughter and applause] If I still have time, I might add, Mr. Trewhitt, I might add that it was Seneca or it was Cicero, I don't know which, that said, ""If it was not for the elders correcting the mistakes of the young, there would be no state.''"	1
ClaimBuster	7585				Send us some people that will pass the idea.	0
ClaimBuster	7586				Yes, and thousands, maybe millions of Americans were turned off because of the uh - problems that came out of our involvement in Vietnam.	1
ClaimBuster	7587				They live all across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	7588				We spent $3.1 billion for fire and police, $3.1 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	7589				It is essential that we extend freedom, extend it to all the world.	0
ClaimBuster	7590				And it's the largest number ever this year and they'll break the record next year and every year for ten years running.	1
ClaimBuster	7591				The individuals that would then get jobs - give them a break that encourages them to leave the social welfare programs and go to work.	0
ClaimBuster	7592				And spending, I know, can be brought under control because I have fought against excessive spending my entire career.	1
ClaimBuster	7593				He'll claim credit now for crime going down, but it happens because mayors and governors and others have brought crime down.	1
ClaimBuster	7594				But like Nancy Reagan, and so many other people -- you know, I was at a forum with Michael J.	1
ClaimBuster	7595				There is more work to be done.	0
ClaimBuster	7596				There's a difference between preconditions and preparation.	1
ClaimBuster	7597				I still have a couple of minutes left.	1
ClaimBuster	7598				It seemed to me that most of the arguments were partisan, Republican, Democrat, left, right, liberal, conservative.	0
ClaimBuster	7599				If we take the leadership role and build the new technologies, like the new kinds of cars and trucks that Detroit is itching to build, then we can create millions of good new jobs by being first into the market with these new kinds of cars and trucks and other kinds of technologies.	0
ClaimBuster	7600				Well, they've got a point.	0
ClaimBuster	7601				But the best way to protect this homeland is to stay on the offense.	0
ClaimBuster	7602				But it has taken place.	1
ClaimBuster	7603				He's been in some other country.	1
ClaimBuster	7604				And I don't think most Americans could do that.	0
ClaimBuster	7605				But if somebody wanted to be a cardiologist, ten years from now, you'd have to be certain you complied with some of the rules in this extreme medical plan the government was going to take over for all Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	7606				First, after each of my foreign trips I have made recommendations that have been adopted.	1
ClaimBuster	7607				What we're talking about is a combination of a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent.	0
ClaimBuster	7608				I won't put in place magnets for people coming here illegally.	0
ClaimBuster	7609				Here are a couple of differences, though, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	7610				First of all, we all know that in his state of the union message, he told Congress about nuclear materials that didn't exist.	1
ClaimBuster	7611				Now, John Podesta said you have terrible instincts.	1
ClaimBuster	7612				We've been discouraged too long.	0
ClaimBuster	7613				But one of the problems we have in the military is we're in a lot of places around the world.	1
ClaimBuster	7614				Chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with e-mails and so many other things.	0
ClaimBuster	7615				I remember in the period immediately before the Korean War, South Korea was supposed to be indefensible as well.	0
ClaimBuster	7616				You're the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb.	1
ClaimBuster	7617				What are we going to tell our children?	0
ClaimBuster	7618				Our position happened to be at the airport.	1
ClaimBuster	7619				You ought to be glad you quit, Oscar, 30 years.	0
ClaimBuster	7620				I don't believe, like the vice president does, in huge government.	0
ClaimBuster	7621				I didn't hear, John, exactly where he was going to cut and what he was going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	7622				That's why I'm for instant background checks at gun shows, I'm for trigger locks, I think that makes sense.	0
ClaimBuster	7623				It's our vision of America.	0
ClaimBuster	7624				I mean, we can have a debate back and forth about the merits of each other's campaigns.	0
ClaimBuster	7625				I don't want to jump in.	0
ClaimBuster	7626				I keep my word, and you will have a tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	7627				I think our faith tells us, instructs us, about the moral life that we should lead.	0
ClaimBuster	7628				Ladies and gentlemen, it's his tax plan.	0
ClaimBuster	7629				But what he has said is that, even knowing there were no weapons of mass destruction, even knowing there was no imminent threat, even knowing there was no connection with Al Qaida, he would still have done everything the same way.	1
ClaimBuster	7630				The major purpose of an election for president is to choose a leader.	1
ClaimBuster	7631				And the truth is, there is a lot wrong with America.	0
ClaimBuster	7632				Uh Mr. Kraft, uh - I think the record can be put in this uh - in this way, which uh - is the way that I think satisfies most Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	7633				I'd like to just talk about issues, and so --	0
ClaimBuster	7634				We shut the loophole which has American workers actually subsidizing the loss of their own job.	1
ClaimBuster	7635				And our cancer rate is uh - higher than any country in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	7636				And so what I want to do is keep this expansion going.	0
ClaimBuster	7637				Well, tonight we've had a chance to talk a lot about the past.	1
ClaimBuster	7638				And I oppose it, and I'm going to stand up and continue to oppose it.	0
ClaimBuster	7639				If we can reduce our energy consumption, that reduces the amount of petro dollars that they have to make mischief around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	7640				That's what Admiral Mullen said.	1
ClaimBuster	7641				It - my view is the same as his.	0
ClaimBuster	7642				It's the right thing for the consumers.	0
ClaimBuster	7643				We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen per cent over seven years.	1
ClaimBuster	7644				The only two times when an unbalanced budget is warranted would be during a serious recession - and we had that in fifty-eight in an unbalanced budget of twelve billion dollars - or a national emergency where there should be large expenditures for national defense, which we had in World War II and uh - during part of the Korean War.	1
ClaimBuster	7645				I gotta get it in perspective.	0
ClaimBuster	7646				It would have been increase in sectarian violence.	0
ClaimBuster	7647				I think that Joe Biden is qualified in many respects.	0
ClaimBuster	7648				Once we break out -- once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come...	0
ClaimBuster	7649				Wherever possible the -- the benefit of having two parents in the home, and that's not always possible.	0
ClaimBuster	7650				They recruit them, leaving the older, sicker seniors in Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	7651				And the president has a regular opportunity to label them as a currency manipulator, but refuses to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	7652				We have, during his regime, during President Obama's regime, we've doubled our national debt.	1
ClaimBuster	7653				In analyzing the figures we will find that our unemployment exists among the older citizens; it exists also among those who are inadequately trained; that is, those who do not have an adequate opportunity for education.	1
ClaimBuster	7654				Because I support the Second Amendment doesn't mean that I want people who shouldn't have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family.	0
ClaimBuster	7655				And Secretary Acheson made a very famous speech at the Press Club, early in the year that k- Korean War started, indicating in effect that South Korea was beyond the defense zone of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	7656				From the standpoint of MR, KENNEDY: Well let me say that I think that the president operates in a number of different areas.	0
ClaimBuster	7657				If they know that they will be helping to make decisions and won't be excluded from being an involved party to the national purpose.	0
ClaimBuster	7658				I've worked with those leaders the president talks about, I've worked with them for 20 years, for longer than this president.	1
ClaimBuster	7659				In terms of the Third World, I support the Baker plan.	0
ClaimBuster	7660				The other stuff -- all the other stuff I mentioned -- costs much less than that.	1
ClaimBuster	7661				And for Mr. Carter to suggest that I want to do away with the safety laws and with the laws that pertain to clean water and clean air, and so forth.	0
ClaimBuster	7662				Every one of these items that I have mentioned he's been wrong - dead wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	7663				And the only reason the unemployment rate seems a little lower today is because of all the people that have dropped out of the workforce.	1
ClaimBuster	7664				They showed up in Afghanistan when they were there, because they tried to beat us and they didn't.	1
ClaimBuster	7665				But not just jobs, good paying jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	7666				This was a proliferator out of Pakistan that was selling secrets to places like North Korea and Libya.	1
ClaimBuster	7667				And so the question is: Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street?	0
ClaimBuster	7668				As President, I would press for long-term, vigorous economic growth.	0
ClaimBuster	7669				They lost about a million people in the war, the Korean War, the forgotten war.	1
ClaimBuster	7670				You get shot walking to the store.	1
ClaimBuster	7671				That's not the position you took, however.	0
ClaimBuster	7672				They have not only 15,000 nuclear warheads, but they've got enough to make another 40,000, and some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of Al Qaida.	1
ClaimBuster	7673				Because what I have proposed...	0
ClaimBuster	7674				Our competitors don't do that.	1
ClaimBuster	7675				There ought to be a full-time uh - atomic energy specialist, independent of the power company in the control room, full time, twenty-four hours a day, to shut down a plant if an abnormality develops.	0
ClaimBuster	7676				So let me just give you one other thing.	0
ClaimBuster	7677				Someone who can analyze the depths of feeling in our country to set a standard for our people to follow, to inspire our people to reach for greatness, to correct our defects, to answer difficult questions, to bind ourselves together in a spirit of unity.	0
ClaimBuster	7678				They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it.	0
ClaimBuster	7679				We have a great many people, hundreds of thousands of people living on public assistance in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	7680				But it's one of the great tragedies related to violence in our society which has occurred during this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	7681				We're talking about 2 weeks from now you've gotta decide who's gonna be president.	1
ClaimBuster	7682				And I think it's going down.	0
ClaimBuster	7683				The question really is: which candidate and which party can meet the problems that the United States is going to face in the sixties?	0
ClaimBuster	7684				And I want to come back to something I said before.	0
ClaimBuster	7685				Now that we have these surpluses, it's our responsibility to indemnify the farmer during that period that we get rid of the farmer uh - the surpluses.	0
ClaimBuster	7686				I have fought to reduce the earmarks and eliminate them.	1
ClaimBuster	7687				Somewhere out there there's an extraterrestrial that's doing this to us, I guess.	0
ClaimBuster	7688				The CBO said very clearly that if you were to adopt the president's plan, there would be a $2 trillion hole in Social Security, because today's workers pay in to the system for today's retirees.	1
ClaimBuster	7689				But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax.	1
ClaimBuster	7690				"Then he called her ""Miss Housekeeping,"" because she was Latina."	1
ClaimBuster	7691				You know, remember the question, are you better off?	0
ClaimBuster	7692				They also kick me around.	0
ClaimBuster	7693				But I certainly would have consulted with governors and elected officials before I would have acted unilaterally.	0
ClaimBuster	7694				And unless we are holding ourselves accountable day in, day out, not just when there's a crisis for folks who have power and influence and can hire lobbyists, but for the nurse, the teacher, the police officer, who, frankly, at the end of each month, they've got a little financial crisis going on.	0
ClaimBuster	7695				So we've got to do something for them.	0
ClaimBuster	7696				But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue.	1
ClaimBuster	7697				They were pressing it very hard.	1
ClaimBuster	7698				And yet some of our finest presidents, some of our strongest international leaders were governors-Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt.	1
ClaimBuster	7699				Those on Social Security today will have their promise made, but also to give younger workers the option at their choice of being able to manage some of their own money in the private sector to make sure there's a Social Security system around tomorrow.	1
ClaimBuster	7700				So I'm putting in more than -- by the time it's finished, I'll have more than $100 million invested.	1
ClaimBuster	7701				Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people -- he's willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him.	1
ClaimBuster	7702				Those arms could be used to hurt us down the road.	0
ClaimBuster	7703				But this deal that we're doing with BAC and US Air and KLM and Northwest, guess who's on the president's campaign big time: a guy from Northwest.	1
ClaimBuster	7704				You've got a mature workforce.	0
ClaimBuster	7705				"Now as far as his figures are concerned here tonight, he again is engaging in this, what I would call, mirror game of ""here-it-is-and-here-it-isn't."""	0
ClaimBuster	7706				The Ford administration does have a very comprehensive program to help uh - our major metropolitan areas.	0
ClaimBuster	7707				And the key to great schools, great teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	7708				Looking then to this problem of how the United States should move ahead and where the United States is moving, I think it is well that we take the advice of a very famous campaigner: Let's look at the record.	0
ClaimBuster	7709				We need to expand education savings accounts.	0
ClaimBuster	7710				The tensions will be ratcheted up.	0
ClaimBuster	7711				People who fly on airplanes today, the cargo hold is not X-rayed, but the baggage is.	1
ClaimBuster	7712				Why didn't you do it?	0
ClaimBuster	7713				When you come out in 2014, I presume I'm going to be president.	0
ClaimBuster	7714				I don't think it's a question of eliminating.	0
ClaimBuster	7715				Look, I mean, Senator McCain keeps on using this example that suddenly the president would just meet with somebody without doing any preparation, without having low-level talks.	1
ClaimBuster	7716				I said, if we do the things that I've set out and we are successful, we could begin to draw the troops down in six months.	0
ClaimBuster	7717				And we are the US, and we have a responsibility to lead and to guarantee the security.	0
ClaimBuster	7718				There's no doubt that the system needs reform and there are a lot of screwy things that we end up spending money on, and they need to be eliminated.	0
ClaimBuster	7719				And what I think needs to happen in order to encourage the young to become involved is to shoot straight, is to set aside the partisan differences, and set an agenda that will make sense.	0
ClaimBuster	7720				As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens.	0
ClaimBuster	7721				I appreciate wind jobs in Iowa and across our country.	0
ClaimBuster	7722				I don't know why -- I've never understood quite why Mr. Perot was so upset it, because one of the guys he used to have working for him, I believe, had foreign accounts.	1
ClaimBuster	7723				After the United States took the initiative in working with Israel and with Egypt and achieving the Sinai II agreement - and I'm proud to say that not a single Egyptian or Israeli soldier has lost his life since the signing of the Sinai agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	7724				My targeted tax cut is for child-rearing, buying a first-time home, paying for health care costs.	0
ClaimBuster	7725				I think the government can do better.	0
ClaimBuster	7726				I have seen us ignore Africa.	0
ClaimBuster	7727				Well, Mr. Ford acts like he's uh - running for president for the first time.	0
ClaimBuster	7728				And I have been a consistent reformer.	1
ClaimBuster	7729				You know, one of the responsibilities of growing older, it seems to me, is being able to tell people something they may not want to hear just because it's true.	0
ClaimBuster	7730				It wasn't created that is it was created as a whole retirement or supplement to retirement program.	1
ClaimBuster	7731				Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment.	1
ClaimBuster	7732				"Now furthermore, I am not gonna tell you ""read my lips"" on anything because I cannot foresee what emergencies might develop in this country."	0
ClaimBuster	7733				George Bush didn't propose turning Medicare into a voucher.	1
ClaimBuster	7734				It was very clear, the Russian intentions towards Georgia.	0
ClaimBuster	7735				Those are some brief remarks about the failures of this administration.	0
ClaimBuster	7736				It's important to be friends with people when you don't need each other so that when you do there's a strong bond of friendship.	0
ClaimBuster	7737				I saw it done with our -- our wonderful Ronald Reagan, a conservative from California, and the liberal Democrat Tip O'Neill from Massachusetts.	1
ClaimBuster	7738				Senator Dole voted against student loans, against Headstart, against creating the Department of Education.	1
ClaimBuster	7739				He's proposed $2.2 trillion of new spending, and yet the so-called tax on the rich, which is also a tax on many small-business owners in America, raises $600 million by our account -- billion, $800 billion by his account.	1
ClaimBuster	7740				I see a young man that was elected to the Senate twice, to the House of Representatives twice.	1
ClaimBuster	7741				It empowers people, it trusts people, it makes -- and it's a practical way to encourage people to purchase health care insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	7742				A lot of these people in industries can be converted to the industries of tomorrow, and that's where the high-paying jobs are.	0
ClaimBuster	7743				They are providing the kind of competitions that have upgraded both schools -- types of schools.	1
ClaimBuster	7744				It had its flaws, it had its problems, the first time we had looked at the issue of education in America from a nationwide perspective.	0
ClaimBuster	7745				But my plan is a departure from trickle-down economics, just cutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans and getting out of the way.	0
ClaimBuster	7746				I'm asking for your vote, and God bless.	0
ClaimBuster	7747				I also want a bridge to the truth.	0
ClaimBuster	7748				They do stand for something.	0
ClaimBuster	7749				And the enemy only has to be right once to hurt us.	0
ClaimBuster	7750				Now, I wonder if the -- it's been blocked by the opponents in the majority in the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	7751				I wouldn't single out just food.	0
ClaimBuster	7752				I think the press can play a huge roll in making sure that the backgrounds are clearly presented in an objective way.	0
ClaimBuster	7753				But maybe there ought to be more debates.	0
ClaimBuster	7754				"That's the kind of mindset that said, ""Let's keep it at the United Nations and hope things go well."""	0
ClaimBuster	7755				Well, that is not what happens in these cases.	0
ClaimBuster	7756				We need this kind of strength because we're the guardians of the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	7757				I'm so glad that I have the chance to knock that down.	0
ClaimBuster	7758				Bring them back into the mainstream of public life.	0
ClaimBuster	7759				They're on the front lines.	0
ClaimBuster	7760				We've tried to buy success from our enemies, and at the same time we've excluded from the process the normal friendship of our allies.	0
ClaimBuster	7761				But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us.	0
ClaimBuster	7762				But if you're talking about protecting the taxpayer against his friends in the US Congress, go back to what it was like when you had a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	7763				We know what the problems are, my friends, and we know what the fixes are.	0
ClaimBuster	7764				A commitment to continuing step-by-step healthcare reform with the next step helping people who are between jobs to access healthcare and not lose it just because they are out of work for a while.	0
ClaimBuster	7765				And they brought him down.	1
ClaimBuster	7766				Who will dominate Asia in the next five or ten years?	0
ClaimBuster	7767				What Michael says, don't put all these rules on us, just let us teach and hold us accountable for every grade.	0
ClaimBuster	7768				And just this year, Mr. Bush vetoed a tax increase on the wealthy that gave middle class tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	7769				We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.	0
ClaimBuster	7770				We found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	7771				No, I mean, he clarified what he meant.	1
ClaimBuster	7772				All schools, all school districts, students themselves, and required teacher testing, which goes a step farther than Governor Bush has been willing to go.	0
ClaimBuster	7773				This is the worst trade year in American history by far.	1
ClaimBuster	7774				"Well number one on Indochina, Mr. Nixon talked in - before the newspaper editors in the spring of 1954 about putting, and I quote him, ""American boys into Indochina."""	1
ClaimBuster	7775				And, you know, in 2006 seniors are going to get prescription drug coverage for the first time in Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	7776				What we have done is to hold the lid on spending in an effort to reduce the rate of inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	7777				The question is our future.	0
ClaimBuster	7778				We've also stood up to the new threats of terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	7779				We go back to Washington and very difficult to get it through the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	7780				Everybody knows how to fix them.	0
ClaimBuster	7781				I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in.	0
ClaimBuster	7782				In uh - December of uh - 1975 he vetoed the roughly 18 to 20 billion dollar uh tax-reduction bill that had been passed by the Congress, and then he came back later on in January of this year and he did advocate a $10 billion tax reduction, but it would be offset by a $6 billion increase this coming January in deductions for Social Security payments and for unemployment compensation.	1
ClaimBuster	7783				And from those five, I always chose the first one or second one.	1
ClaimBuster	7784				The agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis was signed at the White House and the agreement -- the peace treaty with Jordan, I was -- I went to Jordan to sign that -- to be there.	1
ClaimBuster	7785				"His first statement was, ""Both sides ought to show restraint."""	1
ClaimBuster	7786				If you like that, you'll love Canada and England.	0
ClaimBuster	7787				You need a better community, you know, relation.	0
ClaimBuster	7788				Actually, Mr. Vice President, it's not true.	0
ClaimBuster	7789				Thank you, Arizona State, for welcoming us.	0
ClaimBuster	7790				You asked me a question.	1
ClaimBuster	7791				We have made available to the Israelis over 45 percent of the total economic and military aid since the establishment of Israel twenty-seven years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	7792				I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it.	0
ClaimBuster	7793				I am very oriented toward the future.	0
ClaimBuster	7794				So I believe in flexibility, I believe in a national reading initiative for local districts to access with K through 2 diagnostic testing, curriculum that works, phonics works, by the way, it needs to be a part of our curriculum.	0
ClaimBuster	7795				Jim, I don't think that's a fair shot.	0
ClaimBuster	7796				Nobody is suggesting that we unilaterally disarm or somehow reduce our strength, of course not.	0
ClaimBuster	7797				That makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support.	1
ClaimBuster	7798				We don't think that those people should be allowed to continue operating free.	0
ClaimBuster	7799				We've got to have somebody who is fighting for patients and making sure that you get decent, affordable health care.	0
ClaimBuster	7800				Took it three steps, twice we sent welfare reform to the president and he vetoed it.	1
ClaimBuster	7801				And I went there hoping that, once and for all, the free world would act in concert to get Saddam Hussein to listen to our demands.	0
ClaimBuster	7802				Yeah, but wouldn't that suggest to the American people, then, here's a quality person, if he decided that he could automatically get the nomination of either party?	0
ClaimBuster	7803				It should be a helping hand, and tax relief and the proposals I just described should be a good helping hand.	1
ClaimBuster	7804				It needs to be in our vital interest, the mission needs to be clear, and the extra strategy obvious.	0
ClaimBuster	7805				You can't have a consequence for somebody without fear of getting sued under federal law.	1
ClaimBuster	7806				To do that you need a system of managed competition where all of us are covered in big groups and we can choose our doctors and our hospitals, a wide range, but there is an incentive to control costs.	0
ClaimBuster	7807				Mr. Nixon uh - shows himself i- misinformed.	0
ClaimBuster	7808				This administration may say they have a plan, but the truth is they have not even released all the money, the paltry sum of money, that Congress appropriated.	1
ClaimBuster	7809				Von Fremd, it would be completely irresponsible for a candidate for the presidency, or for a president himself, to indicate the course of action and the weapons he would use in the event of such an attack.	0
ClaimBuster	7810				The laws protect the American taxpayer in this regard.	1
ClaimBuster	7811				And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding.	0
ClaimBuster	7812				So I'm not prepared to threaten it, as Senator Obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan.	1
ClaimBuster	7813				I just don't believe that would stimulate any kind of growth at all.	0
ClaimBuster	7814				I don't think there's any question about that, and I resent it.	0
ClaimBuster	7815				Three times since World War II, the Vice President has had to suddenly become the President and commander in chief.	1
ClaimBuster	7816				And I'd like to thank those of you who are watching.	0
ClaimBuster	7817				I see a man who is young and I am putting my confidence in a whole generation of people that are in their 30√É¬è√¢‚Äö¬¨s and 40√É¬è√¢‚Äö¬¨s.	0
ClaimBuster	7818				Uh - another system is where uhh - a dentist can invest money in say, raising cattle and uh - can put in a hundred thousand dollars of his own money, borrow nine hundred thousand dollars - nine hundred mi- thousand dollars - that makes a million - and mark off a great amount of uh - of loss uh - through that procedure.	1
ClaimBuster	7819				Well, let me translate that, if I can, Chris, because...	0
ClaimBuster	7820				In order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from the ground; we have to improve our utilization of coal - make it more efficient, make it cleaner.	0
ClaimBuster	7821				But we also need to look at some options, whether or not we -- depending on what the options are.	0
ClaimBuster	7822				Now, the Governor has also played a little fast and loose with the facts about vetoes.	0
ClaimBuster	7823				And yet think about where we are: Added 1.9 million new jobs over the past 13 months.	1
ClaimBuster	7824				And what he is saying, if I understand him correctly, is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this choice.	0
ClaimBuster	7825				I'm just not going to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	7826				What I have been advocating is, why don't we start with the Federal Government turning back tax sources to states and local governments, as well as the responsibilities for those programs?	0
ClaimBuster	7827				In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed.	1
ClaimBuster	7828				On the other things that you've just said about the terrorists, I'm tempted to ask you what you would do.	0
ClaimBuster	7829				Guinea and Ghana have both moved within the Soviet sphere of influence in foreign policy; so has Cuba.	1
ClaimBuster	7830				And you guys have been having a hard time, and I want to fight for you.	0
ClaimBuster	7831				I'd like to change that.	0
ClaimBuster	7832				Number one, we spend at least $60 billion a year on insurance, administrative cost, bureaucracy, and government regulation that wouldn't be spent in any other nation.	1
ClaimBuster	7833				Term limits for members of the US Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	7834				In 1974, we had the worst recession, the deepest and most penetrating recession since the Second World War.	1
ClaimBuster	7835				It's not government investments that makes businesses grow and hire people.	1
ClaimBuster	7836				It's going to help everything.	0
ClaimBuster	7837				Secondly, I think we have a rich uh - country.	0
ClaimBuster	7838				They've had their chance to deliver a tax cut to you.	0
ClaimBuster	7839				Make an effort to put a ramp up there so someone in a wheelchair can get up.	0
ClaimBuster	7840				But Senator Dole has consistently opposed Federal help to education.	1
ClaimBuster	7841				And we ought to have to limit -- we ought to have a much longer period of time, about 5 years, between the time when people can leave executive branch offices and then go out and start lobbying for foreign interests.	0
ClaimBuster	7842				The president inherited growth of over 5 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	7843				That's not what happens in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	7844				I blame the president for the things the president could do that has an impact on it.	0
ClaimBuster	7845				We have the strongest military, and I'll do whatever is necessary, if I'm president, to make sure that it stays that way.	1
ClaimBuster	7846				Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children's Health Insurance Program.	1
ClaimBuster	7847				"My opponent says help is on the way, but what kind of message does it say to our troops in harm's way, ""wrong war, wrong place, wrong time""?"	1
ClaimBuster	7848				Number two, by stealing our intellectual property; our designs, our patents, our technology.	0
ClaimBuster	7849				So I agree that we have to speak responsibly and we have to act responsibly.	0
ClaimBuster	7850				If you put 50 tons of TNT in each one of railroad cars, you would have a carload of TNT - a trainload of TNT stretching across this nation.	1
ClaimBuster	7851				But I also laid out a very strict series of things we needed to do in order to proceed from a position of strength.	1
ClaimBuster	7852				I would say that a president will be able to lead - a president will be able to get his program through - to the effect that he has the support of the country, the support of the people.	0
ClaimBuster	7853				I remember being in a high school in my own state as we were organizing something we call the Governor's Alliance Against Drugs, and a young 16 year old girl coming up to me, desperate, addicted, dependent, saying, Governor, I need help.	1
ClaimBuster	7854				But second, in addition to that, if we do get into a recessionary period we should move on that part of the economy which is represented by the private sector, and I mean stimulate that part of the economy that can create jobs - the private sector of the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	7855				But it was a surprise to us, because they outnumbered us 64 to 36 in submarines and 20 percent more bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles than we had.	1
ClaimBuster	7856				And today, we have about five hundred Georgians at their own expense - just working people who believe in me - spread around the country uh - involved in the political campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	7857				With our modern technology, yes, we can burn our coal within the limits of the Clean Air Act.	1
ClaimBuster	7858				You're judged by the whole record.	0
ClaimBuster	7859				On any program, and this includes crime, you'll find we have all kinds of great plans lying around that never get enacted into law and implemented.	1
ClaimBuster	7860				A few things that can be done: we have now a deferral system so that the multinational corporations who invest overseas - if they make a million dollars in profits overseas - they don't have to pay any of their taxes unless they bring their money back into this country.	1
ClaimBuster	7861				I think what he should have done is gone before the American people on the front end and said listen, I made a commitment and it was wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	7862				And the result is that you've been bombarded with advertisements suggesting that I've changed a position on this or that or the other.	1
ClaimBuster	7863				Everybody who's looked at it, 500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say it's bad for the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	7864				By the third grade many times children who were in the Head Start program aren't any better off than the others.	1
ClaimBuster	7865				Well, the uh - the assumption that - that you uh - have described as different is in the rate of growth of our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	7866				He's the first president in 72 years to lose jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	7867				Of course, we change tactics when need to, but we never change our beliefs, the strategic beliefs that are necessary to protect this country in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	7868				"So we had a policy called ""Mend it, don't end it."	1
ClaimBuster	7869				And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee.	1
ClaimBuster	7870				And we want to shrink those groups and those networks and we can do that.	0
ClaimBuster	7871				The money goes 100 percent -- 100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military.	1
ClaimBuster	7872				And I don't agree with them.	0
ClaimBuster	7873				We have got to become more concerned about people who play by the rules and get the balance we require.	0
ClaimBuster	7874				Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them.	0
ClaimBuster	7875				It's going to be a hard fight.	0
ClaimBuster	7876				Jason, I appreciate that very much, being a former military man myself.	1
ClaimBuster	7877				We need to think differently about the issue.	0
ClaimBuster	7878				As a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	7879				Yet at the same time, he was very -- we were very unpopular in Europe because of the decisions he made.	1
ClaimBuster	7880				I thought it was in our strategic interests to keep Milosevic in check because of our relations in NATO, and that's why I took the position I took.	0
ClaimBuster	7881				Saddam Hussein was a risk to our country, ma'am.	0
ClaimBuster	7882				As a result of that wonderful experience all over the United States, there is a new spirit in America.	0
ClaimBuster	7883				Government -- he says invest government, grow government.	1
ClaimBuster	7884				We also ought to make it very clear that the Russians are in violation of their cease-fire agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	7885				I mean, this guy, this is too much.	0
ClaimBuster	7886				If I should ever decide in the future to discuss my - my deep Christian beliefs and uh - condemnation and sinfulness, I'll use another forum besides Playboy.	0
ClaimBuster	7887				After he left the senate, we abandoned that.	1
ClaimBuster	7888				We have a strong charter school movement that I signed the legislation to get started in the State of Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	7889				Oh, I just thought about one.	0
ClaimBuster	7890				At his pace, it's going to take 13 years to reduce and get ahold of all the loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	7891				And simple things weren't done.	0
ClaimBuster	7892				If we do those things, then I believe that we can create a better school system.	0
ClaimBuster	7893				We cannot allow Iran to get a nuclear weapon.	0
ClaimBuster	7894				The only way to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore at home.	0
ClaimBuster	7895				And let me tell you, you're absolutely right about part of that, which is I want to bring the rates down, I want to simplify the tax code, and I want to get middle- income taxpayers to have lower taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	7896				That's why it's so important for us to be able to work in concert with our allies.	0
ClaimBuster	7897				As I said, almost 30% of it goes to Americans that make more than $1 million per year.	1
ClaimBuster	7898				I don't think he misled you when he said that, you know, anyone who doubted whether the world was better off without Saddam Hussein in power didn't have the judgment to be president.	0
ClaimBuster	7899				They've got so many loopholes they don't have to pay much in taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	7900				I agree with the governor.	0
ClaimBuster	7901				You take a look at Mosul.	0
ClaimBuster	7902				They left -- fired 1,400 people.	1
ClaimBuster	7903				It's one America, one nation.	0
ClaimBuster	7904				And, in this connection, I think that uh - we must look to the future having in mind the fact that we fight Communism at home not only by our laws to deal with Communists uh - the few who do become Communists and the few who do become tra- fellow travelers, but we also fight Communism at home by moving against those various injustices which exist in our society which the Communists feed upon.	0
ClaimBuster	7905				If the uh - list was, uh - in my opinion, fairly uniform, if there was no outstanding person, then I would undoubtedly choose someone who would most accurately reflect my own basic politi- political philosophy as best I could determine it.	0
ClaimBuster	7906				There's a pattern here of appealing to the auto workers and then trying to appeal to the spotted owl crowds or the extremes in the environmental movement.	0
ClaimBuster	7907				Is it true that this Administration, as Senator Kennedy has charged, has been an Administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation?	0
ClaimBuster	7908				Sometimes we cannot let other countries have a veto on our foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	7909				It is -- our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster.	1
ClaimBuster	7910				Now, the president has presided over an economy where we've lost 1.6 million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	7911				Now let's keep going by finishing the work of putting the police on the street and tackling juvenile gangs.	0
ClaimBuster	7912				I will make them famous.	0
ClaimBuster	7913				So I think that the idea of humility is an important one.	0
ClaimBuster	7914				I know our allies, and I can work much more closely with them.	0
ClaimBuster	7915				I just don't know how the president could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the -- at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	7916				I don't want to try to put our troops in all places at all times.	0
ClaimBuster	7917				In some cases, we are going to have to invest.	0
ClaimBuster	7918				I think this should be indicative of the kind of leaders I would choose to help me if I am elected.	0
ClaimBuster	7919				So I've proposed four specific things that I think can help.	1
ClaimBuster	7920				It's your understanding of the forces of change that are sweeping the world, and whether or not you're in a position to provide leadership to make those forces of change work for us and not against us.	0
ClaimBuster	7921				And we need to win that future.	0
ClaimBuster	7922				"Yes, my rebuttal, once again, is that this invention that has just been created here of how I would go about rolling over for the Soviet Union -- no, Mr. Mondale, my idea would be with that defensive weapon that we would sit down with them and then say, ""Now, are you willing to join us?"	0
ClaimBuster	7923				And we support the U.N. efforts there.	1
ClaimBuster	7924				You can ship jobs overseas and get tax breaks for it.	1
ClaimBuster	7925				Those words really have to mean something.	0
ClaimBuster	7926				I want to correct, the all these things I voted against, they were probably part of some big package that had a lot of pork in it or a lot of things that we shouldn't have had and we probably voted no.	1
ClaimBuster	7927				That's why I support instant background checks at gun shows.	1
ClaimBuster	7928				And the insurance companies say it won't work and they won't offer these plans.	1
ClaimBuster	7929				And that's why it is essential we not leave.	0
ClaimBuster	7930				And the governor may not want to answer that question, he may want to call it a high school debating trick, but let me tell you this.	0
ClaimBuster	7931				Let's get him working on Syria, their client state, and see if we can't get them to join Israel and other Arab nations, if at all possible, and Arab leaders, in finally bringing peace to that troubled region.	0
ClaimBuster	7932				Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt.	1
ClaimBuster	7933				We don't have a comprehensive understandable foreign policy that deals with world problems or even regional problems.	1
ClaimBuster	7934				The big drug companies support Governor Bush's prescription drug proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	7935				And the world is better off without him in power.	0
ClaimBuster	7936				Well, but he gets the first word of that segment.	0
ClaimBuster	7937				We, in addition, see that uh - in the last uh - four years the number of employees hired by the Congress has gone up substantial- uh much more than uh - the gross national product, much more than any other increase throughout our society.	1
ClaimBuster	7938				It was a bipartisan commission, a study by two respected economists, which indicated that we could collect some 40, 45, 50 billion dollars of those funds.	1
ClaimBuster	7939				Now this may seem like a rigid, inflexible position.	0
ClaimBuster	7940				Iran is one of their biggest trading partners.	1
ClaimBuster	7941				New York -- New York has done an excellent job.	0
ClaimBuster	7942				There is a lot of evidence about the very good work...	0
ClaimBuster	7943				Lock your wallet because he's coming right after you just like Jimmy Carter did and just like you're going to get -- you're going to end up with interest rates at 21%, and you're going to have inflation going through the roof.	1
ClaimBuster	7944				But there's no doubt that we have to continue building up readiness and military strength.	0
ClaimBuster	7945				That ammo is now being used against our kids.	0
ClaimBuster	7946				Well yes, I question the figure about the decline in defense spending under the two previous Administrations in the preceding eight years to this Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	7947				If you've been on television about it, you think you did it.	0
ClaimBuster	7948				And that's what I've done administratively.	0
ClaimBuster	7949				The mayor of New York, Mayor Bloomberg, just imposed an across- the-board spending freeze on New York City.	1
ClaimBuster	7950				say, he is our hero.	0
ClaimBuster	7951				Mr. Nixon misstates my figures constantly, which uh - is of course his right, but the fact of the matter is: here is where I stand and I just want to have it on the public record.	0
ClaimBuster	7952				people get so tired of politics.	0
ClaimBuster	7953				It's all about the Constitution of -- of -- and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be.	0
ClaimBuster	7954				It's the kind of priority that will be at the top of our list beginning in January of 1989.	0
ClaimBuster	7955				And I would hope to never have to use force.	0
ClaimBuster	7956				They are often on the front line of catastrophic situations.	0
ClaimBuster	7957				He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful.	1
ClaimBuster	7958				We shouldn't be dwelling on the past, or even the present.	0
ClaimBuster	7959				It says if you√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ve got a complaint with your insurance company, you can take your complaint to an objective body.	1
ClaimBuster	7960				I had a person in the Oval Office who lost a child in a school bus accident where a drunk driver caused the accident directly, but there were problems with the school bus.	1
ClaimBuster	7961				There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money.	1
ClaimBuster	7962				We'll stay on the hunt on Al Qaida.	0
ClaimBuster	7963				Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing.	1
ClaimBuster	7964				We ought to help protect our kids from drugs and guns and gangs and tobacco.	0
ClaimBuster	7965				If you don't get a two-thirds, then your resolution doesn't pass.	1
ClaimBuster	7966				I'm saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs, and I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention.	0
ClaimBuster	7967				My position has always been that the job of the United States was to minimize the risks of peace.	0
ClaimBuster	7968				That made no sense whatsoever.	0
ClaimBuster	7969				We don't want him fishing in troubled waters in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	7970				Take a look at Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	7971				It means that the teacher that I met in Las Vegas, a wonderful young lady, who describes to me -- she's got 42 kids in her class.	1
ClaimBuster	7972				Because a couple of times the governor has said that I am for a bigger government.	1
ClaimBuster	7973				Had gone to school here, pledged allegiance to the flag.	0
ClaimBuster	7974				But I believe that my plan might offer an opportunity for that, if we would move into those areas and let, encourage - with the tax incentive - the private sector, to develop and to create the jobs for the people.	0
ClaimBuster	7975				I think that judgment could be made after election, if I'm successful.	0
ClaimBuster	7976				This is the end of the beginning, if we come out with a package that will keep these institutions stable.	0
ClaimBuster	7977				I'm going to have a special prosecutor.	0
ClaimBuster	7978				And so, again, look at the record, particularly the energy bill.	0
ClaimBuster	7979				I obviously repudiate the Klan; I repudiate anybody who uses the religious issue; I will not tolerate it, I have ordered all of my people to have nothing to do with it and I say - say to this great audience, whoever may be listening, remember, if you believe in America, if you want America to set the right example to the world, that we cannot have religious or racial prejudice.	0
ClaimBuster	7980				If they can't make payroll, then they may end up having to shut their doors and lay people off.	0
ClaimBuster	7981				You - Mr. Truman came to office in nineteen uh - forty-four and at the end of the war, and uh - difficulties that were facing the United States during that period of transition - 1946 when price controls were lifted - so it's rather difficult to use an overall figure taking those seven and a half years and comparing them to the last eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	7982				We've raised about $10 million.	1
ClaimBuster	7983				Candy, there are some jobs that are not going to come back.	0
ClaimBuster	7984				You may not be one of them, you're just not one of the right people.	0
ClaimBuster	7985				I expect to have the opportunity to do so myself.	0
ClaimBuster	7986				But you're investing in companies doesn't do that.	0
ClaimBuster	7987				The problem with a spending freeze is you're using a hatchet where you need a scalpel.	0
ClaimBuster	7988				As a matter fact, in - sin- since the late sixties when Mr. Nixon took office, we've had a reduction in uh - in the percentage of taxes paid by corporations from 30 percent down to about 20 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	7989				I am convinced that, until we reverse this continued decline in home ownership and put a floor under it, and so that people have not only the hope and belief they can stay in their homes and realize the American dream, but that value will come up.	0
ClaimBuster	7990				I think we need to get serious about this energy crisis, both in the Congress and in the White House, and if you entrust me with the presidency, I will tackle this problem and focus on new technologies that will make us less dependent on big oil or foreign oil.	0
ClaimBuster	7991				I have brought into the top level, top levels of government, into the White House, into administrative offices of the Executive branch, into the judicial system, highly qualified black and Spanish citizens and women who in the past had been excluded.	1
ClaimBuster	7992				I want bilateral talks which put all of the issues, from the armistice of 1952, the economic issues, the human rights issues, the artillery disposal issues, the DMZ issues and the nuclear issues on the table.	0
ClaimBuster	7993				But as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don't know Putin.	1
ClaimBuster	7994				The uh - description just made of this administration's record is hard to uh - recognize.	0
ClaimBuster	7995				What I would not have had done was left 10,000 troops in Iraq that would tie us down.	1
ClaimBuster	7996				Let's talk about corporate taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	7997				We should give a tax cut, targeted to child rearing and education, to buying a first home and paying for health care.	0
ClaimBuster	7998				You're going to get a repeat of the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	7999				On day one, I will label China a currency manipulator, which will allow me as president to be able to put in place, if necessary, tariffs where I believe that they are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers.	0
ClaimBuster	8000				I mean, what do you need, a signed document?	0
ClaimBuster	8001				The president's terms are limited to 2, a total of 8 years.	1
ClaimBuster	8002				He gets to decide what he wants to talk about.	0
ClaimBuster	8003				And -- and so the strength that we have shown in Iran is shown by the fact that we've been able to mobilize the world.	0
ClaimBuster	8004				They have no idea where they come from.	1
ClaimBuster	8005				Yes, I would like to add my words of thanks, too, to the ladies of the League of Women Voters for making these debates possible.	0
ClaimBuster	8006				When they tried to reduce taxes, he voted against that 127 times.	1
ClaimBuster	8007				One is to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	8008				You were very much involved in every aspect of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	8009				I think the record shows otherwise.	0
ClaimBuster	8010				Governor, we have actually produced more oil --	1
ClaimBuster	8011				The administration says they support the instant check.	1
ClaimBuster	8012				And so I'm very proud of the way that came about and I think it's a very, very good beginning.	0
ClaimBuster	8013				I think that's the essence of leadership, rather than cutting deals in dark rooms in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	8014				But then of course we had a Democratic Congress and they didn't want to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	8015				And that is just absolutely unfair to the vast majority of Americans who pay their taxes and pay them on time.	0
ClaimBuster	8016				We went in to Somalia as a peacemaking organization, we ended up trying to be -- excuse me, as a peacekeeping organization, we ended up trying to be peacemakers and we ended up having to withdraw in humiliation.	1
ClaimBuster	8017				This, I believe, has assured that our interests will be protected in the Persian Gulf region, as we have done in the Middle East and throughout the world.	0
ClaimBuster	8018				And when we talk about deficits, if we're adding to our deficit for tax cuts for folks who don't need them, and we're cutting investments in research and science that will create the next Apple, create the next new innovation that will sell products around the world, we will lose that race.	0
ClaimBuster	8019				Everybody got tax relief, so that they get out of the recession.	1
ClaimBuster	8020				Now, I have thought for a long time that too many of our churches have been too reluctant to speak up in behalf of what they believe is proper in Government, and they have been too too lax in interfering, in recent years, with Government's invasion of the family itself, putting itself between parent and child.	0
ClaimBuster	8021				I'm not looking to cut taxes for wealthy people.	0
ClaimBuster	8022				I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China.	0
ClaimBuster	8023				She gets a small pension, but in order to pay for her prescription drug benefits, she has to go out seven days a week several hours a day picking up cans.	1
ClaimBuster	8024				"You know, I saw a movie - ""Crocodile Dundee."""	1
ClaimBuster	8025				And we are bleeding arterially.	0
ClaimBuster	8026				It's what are our capabilities.	0
ClaimBuster	8027				And I never made that statement; never would.	1
ClaimBuster	8028				Senator Bentsen said, as you recall at the debate with Senator Quayle, that if you give any of us $200 billion worth of hot checks a year, we can create an illusion of prosperity.	1
ClaimBuster	8029				Well, I'm just quoting you when you were asked...	0
ClaimBuster	8030				And the strains that have been placed on our alliances around the world and the respect that's been diminished over the last eight years has constrained us being able to act on something like the genocide in Darfur, because we don't have the resources or the allies to do everything that we should be doing.	1
ClaimBuster	8031				I can't take anything off the table.	0
ClaimBuster	8032				I use that term with all respect, by the way.	0
ClaimBuster	8033				The - the check on the quality of health care is in a different one.	0
ClaimBuster	8034				Our relationship with Israel, my relationship with the prime minister of Israel is such that we would not get a call saying our bombers are on the way, or their fighters are on the way.	0
ClaimBuster	8035				Well, I'm not gonna name my cabinet before I get elected.	0
ClaimBuster	8036				It's not going to be all done by legislation.	0
ClaimBuster	8037				But I can counsel people.	1
ClaimBuster	8038				You ain't seen nothing yet.	0
ClaimBuster	8039				All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much.	0
ClaimBuster	8040				Because you are so interested in a poll that might have been coming out, or because somebody had said something nasty about somebody else.	0
ClaimBuster	8041				I believe that Governor Carter doesn't realize the need and necessity for arms sales to Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	8042				First of all, I don't think he can succeed in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	8043				And we have a duty to our country and to future generations of America to achieve a free Iraq, a free Afghanistan, and to rid the world of weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	8044				Look, I love to -- I love teachers, and I'm happy to have states and communities that want to hire teachers do that.	0
ClaimBuster	8045				So all of these things need to be examined, of course.	0
ClaimBuster	8046				Let's see how they do.	0
ClaimBuster	8047				He more than doubled state spending while he was Governor - 122% increase - and had between a 20% and 30% increase in the number of employees	1
ClaimBuster	8048				We have to stand for our principles, stand for our allies, stand for a strong military and stand for a stronger economy.	0
ClaimBuster	8049				I think that we're showing the proper compassion and concern.	0
ClaimBuster	8050				But I want to -- on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good.	0
ClaimBuster	8051				But tell her it's not all that gloomy; we're the US, we faced tough problems before.	0
ClaimBuster	8052				I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that's, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve.	0
ClaimBuster	8053				Next year they're going to go up over 100 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	8054				But that having been said, I believe that -- well, first of all, let me say that the governor and I agree on some things where this subject is concerned.	0
ClaimBuster	8055				Anybody who says America's been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling around America.	0
ClaimBuster	8056				But it takes more than that.	0
ClaimBuster	8057				I don't want to rip families apart.	0
ClaimBuster	8058				You can't disallow someone the right to visit their partner in a hospital.	0
ClaimBuster	8059				You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better.	0
ClaimBuster	8060				But I also believe that when he said behind closed doors that 47 percent of the country considered themselves victims who refuse personal responsibility, think about who he was talking about.	1
ClaimBuster	8061				Where we're not making the progress, Sander, is in -- we're making it in teenagers, and thank God, because I thought what Ross said was most appropriate about these families and these children.	0
ClaimBuster	8062				And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries.	1
ClaimBuster	8063				And I think, my gosh, wouldn't it be wonderful if every child had that love and support.	0
ClaimBuster	8064				The vice president keeps saying I'm against things.	1
ClaimBuster	8065				We need to concentrate our research and development effort on uh coal burning and extraction, with safer mines, but also it's clean burning.	0
ClaimBuster	8066				I have clear eyes on this.	0
ClaimBuster	8067				They stand for a whole different approach to the problems facing this country at home and abroad.	0
ClaimBuster	8068				She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o'clock in the morning?	1
ClaimBuster	8069				The problem is, you talk, but you don't get anything done, Hillary.	0
ClaimBuster	8070				That's what a leader does.	0
ClaimBuster	8071				And what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about what's most pressing to them: the economic crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	8072				It's very unlike World War II, when FDR's sons flew missions.	1
ClaimBuster	8073				Twelve percent of our gross national product goes to health care.	1
ClaimBuster	8074				We're the envy of the world in terms of our economy, despite the difficulties we're having.	0
ClaimBuster	8075				... with the Russians and other foreign powers.	0
ClaimBuster	8076				Not to the schools but to -- you know, 46% of the teachers in Chicago, public school teachers, send their kids to private school.	1
ClaimBuster	8077				Karl Marx was the grandfather of Communism.	1
ClaimBuster	8078				NATO, for example, has kept the peace for many, many years, and I want to see us keep fully staffed in NATO so we'll continue to guarantee the peace in Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	8079				But the President that I quoted had made a promise, a Democratic promise, and I quoted him because it was never kept.	0
ClaimBuster	8080				And that is the continued discussion and claim that somehow I am the villain who is going to pull the Social Security checks out from those people who are dependent on them.	0
ClaimBuster	8081				And I'm, you know -- there would be special rights for different groups in America.	0
ClaimBuster	8082				And if we're strong in each of those things, American influence will grow.	0
ClaimBuster	8083				I didn't say we had the worst education in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	8084				What was he referring to?	0
ClaimBuster	8085				Fewer water complaints since I've been the president.	1
ClaimBuster	8086				We're the reform party, and we're going to make things better, and one of the things we're going to do is stop exporting jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	8087				This was an attack by terrorists.	1
ClaimBuster	8088				We have had for many years, understandably, a system of restraints on high technology because the Soviets are behind us.	0
ClaimBuster	8089				I don't think the surplus is the government's money.	0
ClaimBuster	8090				Mr. President, the voluntary thing that I suggested many years ago was that with a young man orphaned and raised by an aunt who died, his aunt was ineligible for Social Security insurance because she was not his mother.	1
ClaimBuster	8091				But I don't see where it is inflationary to have people keep more of their earnings and spend it, and it isn't inflationary for government to take that money away from them and spend it on the things it wants to spend it on.	0
ClaimBuster	8092				We'll spend $25 trillion -- we'll collect $25 trillion in revenue in the next 10 years and spend $21 trillion.	0
ClaimBuster	8093				They feel as if they had finally an administration who was going to take this issue seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	8094				Do they want to follow United States leadership?	0
ClaimBuster	8095				And it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren.	0
ClaimBuster	8096				On that question the Vice President and I disagreed.	1
ClaimBuster	8097				My friends, some of this $700 billion ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.	1
ClaimBuster	8098				We're going to make sure that insurance companies can't discriminate on the basis of pre-existing conditions.	0
ClaimBuster	8099				And that -- don't take my word for it, take the executives at GM and Chrysler, some of whom are Republicans, may even support Governor Romney.	1
ClaimBuster	8100				He can have another ten seconds if he wants, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	8101				Ours is a big state, a fast-growing state.	1
ClaimBuster	8102				Then you didn't read it.	0
ClaimBuster	8103				There, Mr. Khrushchev came to that conference determined to break it up.	1
ClaimBuster	8104				No, because I'm pledged to that, and yes, some taxes have gone up.	1
ClaimBuster	8105				Only the last few days with the election approaching, has Mr. Ford taken any interest in a nonproliferation movement.	0
ClaimBuster	8106				And, absolutely, we need earmark reform.	0
ClaimBuster	8107				"Maybe an 18th resolution would work,"" he would have been stronger and tougher, and the world would have been a lot worse off."	0
ClaimBuster	8108				These islands are a few miles - five or six miles - off the coast of Red China, within a general harbor area and more than a hundred miles from Formosa.	1
ClaimBuster	8109				But the key that we're going to have to pursue is a -- is a pathway to get the Muslim world to be able to reject extremism on its own.	0
ClaimBuster	8110				I was against the war.	1
ClaimBuster	8111				In many cases they are people in the community who are examples, and are role models.	0
ClaimBuster	8112				And there are a bunch of things we can do to make sure your future is bright.	0
ClaimBuster	8113				There is no litmus test on any issue.	0
ClaimBuster	8114				And yet, interestingly enough, we have the most religious freedom of any country in the world, including the freedom not to believe.	1
ClaimBuster	8115				The American people are bright, intelligent, caring, loving people who want a great country for their children and grandchildren.	0
ClaimBuster	8116				I agree with Mr. Bush that values are important.	0
ClaimBuster	8117				And that's what I want to talk about.	0
ClaimBuster	8118				But have no doubt, but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	8119				But we've also got to continue to figure out how we have efficiency energy, because ultimately that's how we're going to reduce demand and that's what's going to keep gas prices lower.	0
ClaimBuster	8120				It's kind of easy to do if you only have to pick up a $30-billion tab to defend your country.	0
ClaimBuster	8121				And we've watched this president actually turn away from some of the treaties that were on the table.	1
ClaimBuster	8122				That is why Senator wh- President Eisenhower was also correct in his policy in the Formosa Straits, where he declined, and refused to follow the recommendations - recommendations which Senator Kennedy voted for in 1955; again made in 1959; again repeated in his debates that you have heard - recommendations with regard to - again - slicing off a piece of free territory, and abandoning it, if - in effect, to the Communists.	1
ClaimBuster	8123				-- and we don't need more of them in the Senate or more of them in the House.	0
ClaimBuster	8124				Could I just respond to this, please?	0
ClaimBuster	8125				Our country has sold out to foreign lobbyists.	1
ClaimBuster	8126				I was with one company that makes valves and -- and process industries and they said, look, we were -- we were having some valves coming in that -- that were broken and we had to repair them under warranty and we looked them and -- and they had our serial number on them.	1
ClaimBuster	8127				And we find bad teachers another line of work.	0
ClaimBuster	8128				I did not say that the Arizona law was a model for the nation in that aspect.	1
ClaimBuster	8129				And now suddenly you're a big champion of coal.	0
ClaimBuster	8130				I've appointed prosecutors, I've appointed defenders.	1
ClaimBuster	8131				Now, for the people earning more than $200,000 a year, you're going to see a rollback to the level we were at with Bill Clinton, when people made a lot of money.	0
ClaimBuster	8132				They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance.	1
ClaimBuster	8133				We don't want to go back to that.	0
ClaimBuster	8134				Well, the -- John, 10 days ago, you said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.	1
ClaimBuster	8135				Well, thank you very much, Jim, for this opportunity.	0
ClaimBuster	8136				I believe that the more dependent we become on foreign oil, the less our national security is enhanced.	0
ClaimBuster	8137				First of all, let me say that I've spent more of my time and life on this in the last 12 years than any other issue.	1
ClaimBuster	8138				I think that would be a - a very serious mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	8139				And I promise you that that will happen.	0
ClaimBuster	8140				What we're going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology.	0
ClaimBuster	8141				I'm for free trade philosophically, but I have studied these trade agreements till the world has gone flat, and we don't have good trade agreements across the world.	0
ClaimBuster	8142				But we are protecting both of them.	0
ClaimBuster	8143				I think of people in the law enforcement community who are taking their lives in their hands everyday, when they go up to one of those doors and kick it down and try to stop this flow of drugs into our communities and into our kids.	0
ClaimBuster	8144				And the reason is crack babies being born, babies in the hospital 42 days.	1
ClaimBuster	8145				They are the best workers in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	8146				So I am convinced that together, we can, with the French, with the British, with the Germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect Iranian behavior.	0
ClaimBuster	8147				But keep in mind we are spending 30% more on health care than any country in the world, any country, and yet we have 35 million people uninsured, we have no preventing and primary care.	1
ClaimBuster	8148				I've talked with a number of them.	1
ClaimBuster	8149				In Africa - these countries that have newly joined the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	8150				I don't think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self-defense tradition.	0
ClaimBuster	8151				But as long as they have an economy that leaves so many people in dire poverty and unemployment, they are going to seek that employment across our borders.	1
ClaimBuster	8152				You see it in the church burnings.	0
ClaimBuster	8153				I'm going to do it in four years.	0
ClaimBuster	8154				Mr. Perot, with all respect, I think it is highly relevant, and I think that a 4-billion dollar budget of state and federal funds is not all that small, and I think the fact that I took a state that was one of the poorest states in the country and had been for 153 years and tried my best to modernize its economy and to make the kind of changes that have generated support from people like the presidents of Apple Computer and Hewlett-Packard and some of the biggest companies in this country, 24 retired generals and admirals and hundreds of business executives, are highly relevant.	1
ClaimBuster	8155				And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads.	1
ClaimBuster	8156				With regard to the freedom of the individual for choice with regard to abortion, there's one individual who's not being considered at all.	0
ClaimBuster	8157				If we'd listened to them, we would never have had a treaty.	0
ClaimBuster	8158				Well, in fact we saved 1,000 jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	8159				And we were -- we were opposed by the administration, another area where I differed with this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	8160				When we do that, instead of shutting the government down over a partisan fight over the budget, we're a better country and that's why we're making progress now.	0
ClaimBuster	8161				I presume the Vice President supported it when the President signed that bill and supports it now.	0
ClaimBuster	8162				Another one is how to address troubled areas of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	8163				Certainly I think all of us agree that when anybody has a government contract, certainly the money that is spent under that contract ought to be disbursed equally without regard to the race or creed or color of the individual who is to be employed.	0
ClaimBuster	8164				It called for uh - conservation measures so that we would save the energy that we have.	0
ClaimBuster	8165				I want to keep taxes low.	0
ClaimBuster	8166				I look around the world and I don't feel that you see North Korea, continuing to export their nuclear technology, Russia said they're not going to follow Nunn-Lugar any more.	1
ClaimBuster	8167				I'm going to stand by Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	8168				It will be a world of peace because we're going to have a clear sight of foreign policy based upon a strong military and a mission that stands by our friends.	0
ClaimBuster	8169				I commend you for supporting that.	0
ClaimBuster	8170				There's an interesting issue up in the northwest as well.	0
ClaimBuster	8171				Well, what they will say about us 100 years from now depends on how we keep our rendezvous with destiny.	0
ClaimBuster	8172				They are great scholars in all cases, and they're people of tremendous respect.	0
ClaimBuster	8173				And what are his health programs?	0
ClaimBuster	8174				The American people are beginning to vote across racial lines, and I hope it will happen more and more.	1
ClaimBuster	8175				You did -- suffered through that?	0
ClaimBuster	8176				All seniors will be covered, all poor seniors will have their prescription drugs paid for, and in the meantime, we'll have a plan to help poor seniors and in the meantime it could be one year or two years.	0
ClaimBuster	8177				I would propose to save the taxpayers of this country from that kind of costly boondoggle.	0
ClaimBuster	8178				I think the moment that you give to the union, on the one side, and to management, on the other side, the escape hatch of eventually going to government to get it settled, that most of these great strikes will end up being settled by government, and that will be a - be in the end, in my opinion, wage control; it would mean price control - all the things that we do not want.	0
ClaimBuster	8179				I think first of all, let me -- let me repeat -- let me repeat what I said.	0
ClaimBuster	8180				It's important, it's their future.	0
ClaimBuster	8181				Now, that's the kind of leadership that I want to provide as president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	8182				We need to reform these programs.	0
ClaimBuster	8183				We were very much involved at the U.N. on the sanction policy of the Bashir government in the Sudan.	1
ClaimBuster	8184				It's a strategy that we've been working on for a couple of years.	1
ClaimBuster	8185				I am against- an across-the-board pardon of draft evaders or military deserters.	0
ClaimBuster	8186				The government doesn't require you to do anything.	1
ClaimBuster	8187				At the same time, we put a limitation of thirteen hundred and twenty on MIRVs.	1
ClaimBuster	8188				And yet, because of the hard work of the American people and good policies, this economy is growing.	1
ClaimBuster	8189				And it won't help us grow.	0
ClaimBuster	8190				And my campaign is about getting this economy back on track, about creating jobs, about a brighter future for America.	0
ClaimBuster	8191				And I think a woman's right to choose ought to be protected and defended.	0
ClaimBuster	8192				We spend now 700 percent more on unemployment compensation than we did eight years ago when the Republicans took over the White House.	1
ClaimBuster	8193				Whether it's Syria, you name it.	0
ClaimBuster	8194				I think he's a good person.	0
ClaimBuster	8195				I'll probably get into a fight in this room with some but I happen to think that we need stronger death penalties for those that kill police officers.	0
ClaimBuster	8196				I know we can do a better job of clean coal technologies.	0
ClaimBuster	8197				Part of American leadership is making sure that we're doing nation building here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	8198				Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country.	0
ClaimBuster	8199				Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	8200				But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law.	1
ClaimBuster	8201				And if we find success we'll praise it.	0
ClaimBuster	8202				You cannot lead the world if you do not honor the contributions of those who are with us.	0
ClaimBuster	8203				And then it gets down to a question of values.	0
ClaimBuster	8204				And I suggested that if this is an insurance program, certainly the person who is paying in should be able to name his own beneficiary.	1
ClaimBuster	8205				In other words, we're going to take Joe's money, give it to Senator Obama, and let him spread the wealth around.	0
ClaimBuster	8206				Right now, the credit markets are frozen up and what that means, as a practical matter, is that small businesses and some large businesses just can't get loans.	1
ClaimBuster	8207				And I'm very proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	8208				In nuclear power we have increased the research and development, uh - under the Energy Research and Development Agency uh - very substantially, to insure that our ener- uh - nuclear power plants are safer, that they are more efficient, and that we have adequate safeguards.	1
ClaimBuster	8209				So we need to do a lot of things, but we ought to start with a better safety net.	0
ClaimBuster	8210				That's why tough choices will be required, choices I am prepared to make, Mr. Bush is not prepared to make.	0
ClaimBuster	8211				And they know this debt must come down as well, because it's unfair to our children.	0
ClaimBuster	8212				So we're now going to take Mosul.	0
ClaimBuster	8213				Our bonds with Israel are larger than agreements or disagreements on some details of diplomatic initiatives.	0
ClaimBuster	8214				Now are we going to have that when it isn't going to help the farmers?	0
ClaimBuster	8215				If I can answer the question.	0
ClaimBuster	8216				You're going to have plans that are so good, because we're going to have so much competition in the insurance industry.	0
ClaimBuster	8217				And these grain sales to the Soviet Union have helped us tremendously in meeting the costs of the additional oil and - the oil that we have bought from overseas.	1
ClaimBuster	8218				You know, every time we take rebels, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else, we're arming people.	1
ClaimBuster	8219				It would've been inconceivable ten - fifteen years ago, for us to be brought to our knees with an Arab oil embargo.	0
ClaimBuster	8220				And I've put ours together in something called the Agenda for American Renewal, and it makes sense, it's sensible, it creates jobs, it gets to the base of the kind of jobs we need.	0
ClaimBuster	8221				And in that there are some Medicaid provisions that will be very helpful to the very kind of people we're talking about here.	0
ClaimBuster	8222				Now, Senator Obama, you wanted to know one of the differences.	0
ClaimBuster	8223				If you're paying less than you paid a year or two ago, why, then, the strategy is working.	1
ClaimBuster	8224				Renee Proval (ph) is probably better off than he was four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	8225				And I'm against price controls.	1
ClaimBuster	8226				The measurement is: Are we as safe as we ought to be?	0
ClaimBuster	8227				Under this administration we've also had an inclination to keep separate the European countries, thinking that if they are separate, then we can dominate them and proceed with our secret, Lone Ranger-type diplomatic efforts.	0
ClaimBuster	8228				I believe that the uh - American people have been turned off in this election, uh - Mr. Maynard, for a variety of reasons.	0
ClaimBuster	8229				It's not like you want to close the loopholes.	0
ClaimBuster	8230				I get audited by the IRS.	1
ClaimBuster	8231				We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it's so dangerous.	1
ClaimBuster	8232				People who will strictly interpret the Constitution and not use the bench to write social policy.	0
ClaimBuster	8233				He said it was a mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	8234				So let's be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it.	0
ClaimBuster	8235				We've got to have a different energy plan.	0
ClaimBuster	8236				And if we - and the - actually this year Congress is doing a little better in controlling the growth of spending.	0
ClaimBuster	8237				Thirdly, whether or not we were prepared and trained to win.	0
ClaimBuster	8238				600,000 of whom, and maybe some of those have since gotten it, but as of a year ago 600,000 of them were actually eligible for it but they couldn't sign up for it because of the barriers that they had set up.	1
ClaimBuster	8239				We'll be resolute, we'll be strong, and we'll wage a comprehensive war against the terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	8240				But if we keep the lid on federal spending, which I think we can - with the help of the Congress, we can justify fully a $28 billion tax reduction.	0
ClaimBuster	8241				"He went on to say, ""Look at her."	1
ClaimBuster	8242				When Governor Reagan has been asked about that, he makes the very disturbing comment that non-proliferation, or the control of the spread of nuclear weapons, is none of our business.	1
ClaimBuster	8243				But the way -- if you look at what's happening, much tougher than they thought.	0
ClaimBuster	8244				I do support the other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill that strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen other ways of dealing with undocumented workers in this difficult area and dealing with the problem of settling people who have lived here for many, many years and do not have an established status.	0
ClaimBuster	8245				I wish he would join me, as a matter of fact, in appealing to the American people for the balanced budget amendment for the federal government and for the line-item veto.	0
ClaimBuster	8246				Uh - Mr. Ford has vetoed, as I said earlier, four times as many bills per year as Mr. Nixon.	1
ClaimBuster	8247				And I'm sure you'll try to do it again.	0
ClaimBuster	8248				We made uh - diplomatic uh - protests to the Cambodian government through the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	8249				The tax issue, because I think it's very important.	0
ClaimBuster	8250				I don't want to be sending parents away from children.	0
ClaimBuster	8251				Let us move now to the future.	0
ClaimBuster	8252				Take a look at the migration.	0
ClaimBuster	8253				I think of a teacher right here, largely Hispanic school, Jaime Escalante, teaching calculus to young kids, 80 percent of them going on to college.	1
ClaimBuster	8254				And the equal rights amendment only says that equality of rights shall not be abridged for omen b the Federal Government or by he state governments.	1
ClaimBuster	8255				John, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important.	0
ClaimBuster	8256				Our energy policies are a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	8257				Civil rights - uh has been confirmed by the Burger Court, hasn't been uh - reversed, and I don't think there's any inclination to reverse those basic decisions.	1
ClaimBuster	8258				We were peaceful when Mr. Ford went into office.	0
ClaimBuster	8259				I can't say for sure that we would have fewer federal employees when I go out of office than when I come in.	0
ClaimBuster	8260				With half of college kids graduating this year without a college -- excuse me, without a job.	1
ClaimBuster	8261				Well, first, I love great schools.	0
ClaimBuster	8262				And we will come home with victory and with honor.	0
ClaimBuster	8263				We need to shift from oil to coal.	0
ClaimBuster	8264				So we're now fighting for Mosul, that we had.	1
ClaimBuster	8265				Not a single young American is fighting or dying on any foreign soil tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	8266				Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989.	0
ClaimBuster	8267				I want to keep this expansion going.	0
ClaimBuster	8268				So, it's conceivable that Governor Romney could bring down gas prices because with his policies, we might be back in that same mess.	0
ClaimBuster	8269				We need a new approach.	0
ClaimBuster	8270				But look at that deal.	0
ClaimBuster	8271				And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	8272				And with each one of those decisions that affect the future of my country, I have learned in the process.	0
ClaimBuster	8273				We've set up the levels of funding and when it is deployable, I will deploy it.	0
ClaimBuster	8274				But I don't think these labels mean a thing and I would hope that tonight in the course of the rest of this campaign, we can have good solid disagreements on issues.	0
ClaimBuster	8275				And I believe it's a good idea, has strong bipartisan support.	0
ClaimBuster	8276				If you make less than $30,000 a year and you put $500 in a savings account, the federal government will match it with $1500.	1
ClaimBuster	8277				And I'd like to remind you, also, as a result of those recommendations, we've probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the Defense Department.	1
ClaimBuster	8278				They're stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology, hacking into our computers, counterfeiting our goods.	1
ClaimBuster	8279				I could run this string out a long time, but remember this, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	8280				And the right time was Tora Bora, when we had him cornered in the mountains.	0
ClaimBuster	8281				I wonder if the Governor would lend his support to that law.	0
ClaimBuster	8282				I hope you don't think that.	0
ClaimBuster	8283				I was not out there when that stock market dropped wringing my hands and saying this was the end of the world as some political leaders were, because it isn't the end of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	8284				But it takes presidential leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	8285				And it is silly putty, folks, and the American people have had enough of it.	0
ClaimBuster	8286				This -- the administration -- the administration indicated this was a reaction to a video and was a spontaneous reaction.	1
ClaimBuster	8287				Federal government doesn't do that.	1
ClaimBuster	8288				Our country now has no comprehensive energy program or policy.	1
ClaimBuster	8289				But those are the choices the next president of the United States is going to have to make.	0
ClaimBuster	8290				We have more people who qualify.	1
ClaimBuster	8291				I think the Congress should have uh - added another $10 billion reduction in personal income taxes, including the increase of personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars.	0
ClaimBuster	8292				I strongly believe in local control of schools.	0
ClaimBuster	8293				But I won't take them lightly.	0
ClaimBuster	8294				They can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and a United States president, me, who said we're not going to take any options off the table.	1
ClaimBuster	8295				Instead our aid continued to Batista, which was ineffective; we never were on the side of freedom; we never used our influence when we could have used it most effectively - and today Cuba is lost for freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	8296				And that's the kind of judge that I want.	0
ClaimBuster	8297				It's their route to the sea.	1
ClaimBuster	8298				Some of the states that have the toughest anti-gun laws have the highest levels of crime.	1
ClaimBuster	8299				And I'm not the one that compared the President of the United States rotting from like a dead fish from the head down.	0
ClaimBuster	8300				And we'll continue to do so over the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	8301				I do not say that.	1
ClaimBuster	8302				We continue to make it a priority for us to go after natural gas.	1
ClaimBuster	8303				And I think we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information.	0
ClaimBuster	8304				My answer to you is in the short-term we need to get after it here in America.	0
ClaimBuster	8305				You're not for school choice, you can't be for school choice, because this is that special interest money again.	0
ClaimBuster	8306				And you have to vote for somebody with a plan.	0
ClaimBuster	8307				And we've made it clear that working with our allies and others, that we are prepared to address any foreseeable eventuality which might interrupt commerce with that crucial area of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	8308				That's what governors ought to do.	0
ClaimBuster	8309				And that can only be done through governmental action.	0
ClaimBuster	8310				These are just ideas of what I would think of if I were in that position and had access to the information, and which I would know all the options that were open to me.	0
ClaimBuster	8311				The fact that we have the strongest economy in history today is not good enough.	0
ClaimBuster	8312				It's not just Donald Trump you're taxing.	0
ClaimBuster	8313				Yes, we should make a great effort.	0
ClaimBuster	8314				And he now completes this term with no progress toward arms control at all, but with a very dangerous arms race underway instead.	1
ClaimBuster	8315				So there will be different ratios in the House, as well as in the Senate, and as president I will be able to uh - work with that Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	8316				But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it?	0
ClaimBuster	8317				Because a lot of young women in this country take this right for granted and it could be lost.	0
ClaimBuster	8318				But it's -- the full faith and credit of the US, in spite of our difficulties, is still pretty good.	0
ClaimBuster	8319				"""So I said all right."	1
ClaimBuster	8320				I want to work for universal free school because we know from all the studies that the youngsters learn, kids learn more in the first few years of life than any where else.	1
ClaimBuster	8321				Let's talk about housing which the question was.	0
ClaimBuster	8322				And the president's been very busy running around the country using what I just described to you as a reason to say I'm wishy-washy, that I'm a flip-flopper.	0
ClaimBuster	8323				We are going to, as I say, we're busy trying to find the centers where these operations stem from, and retaliation will be taken.	0
ClaimBuster	8324				You treated him with terrible disrespect.	0
ClaimBuster	8325				So we're still in the fight.	0
ClaimBuster	8326				But I also believe strongly that we need to enforce laws on the books that the best way to make sure that we keep our society safe and secure is to hold people accountable for breaking the law.	0
ClaimBuster	8327				But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television.	1
ClaimBuster	8328				You see, I'd have found a way to sign that bill.	0
ClaimBuster	8329				Every American should be aware of the seriousness of the step.	0
ClaimBuster	8330				Colin Powell, our secretary of state, announced one day that we were going to continue the dialog of working with the North Koreans.	1
ClaimBuster	8331				That we must share in an ever-increasing scarcity.	0
ClaimBuster	8332				Do you know that Senator Obama has voted for -- is proposing $860 billion of new spending now?	1
ClaimBuster	8333				Now, I think that it's a matter of fundamental right that if we raise the minimum wage, 15 million Americans would be positively affected.	0
ClaimBuster	8334				And I want to express my appreciation to the League of Women Voters for adopting a course with which I believe the great majority of Americans are in agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	8335				It will be a huge down payment for a pretty darn good system.	0
ClaimBuster	8336				First of all is to recognize a tremendous economic strength in this country and to set the putting to - back to work of our people as a top priority.	0
ClaimBuster	8337				We did the right thing.	0
ClaimBuster	8338				There were hunting opportunities, for instance, that haven't previously been available and so forth, so it was a mutually agreed- upon piece of legislation.	1
ClaimBuster	8339				But as a president, I have to represent all the people in the nation.	0
ClaimBuster	8340				And -- and that kind of top -- top-down economics, where folks at the top are doing well, so the average person making $3 million is getting a $250,000 tax break, while middle-class families are burdened further, that's not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth.	1
ClaimBuster	8341				I have fought against spending.	1
ClaimBuster	8342				Everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state.	0
ClaimBuster	8343				It's a sick art form.	0
ClaimBuster	8344				The Head Start program full funding would cost about 5 billion more.	1
ClaimBuster	8345				The president and I have always agreed on that.	1
ClaimBuster	8346				I also believe that we should offer college scholarships to people who will agree to work them off as police officers, and I think, as we reduce our military forces, we should let people earn military retirement by coming out and working as police officers.	0
ClaimBuster	8347				I was sworn to uphold the laws of my state.	1
ClaimBuster	8348				Somebody hit me and said Barry Goldwater said you ought to talk on issues more.	1
ClaimBuster	8349				We differ on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, as I have said.	1
ClaimBuster	8350				We've also got uh - a comparison between himself and Mr. Nixon.	0
ClaimBuster	8351				And the president's right in terms of the additional oil production, but none of it came on federal land.	1
ClaimBuster	8352				But it would require what is known as secondary or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground.	0
ClaimBuster	8353				I want the next president to have fast track negotiating authority to open up markets around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	8354				Four hundred billion, approximately, is a result of what individuals do.	1
ClaimBuster	8355				To the extent humanly possible, we get that out.	0
ClaimBuster	8356				We are going to invest in information technology to eliminate bureaucracy and make the system more efficient.	0
ClaimBuster	8357				So I've been working on it when I was a governor for a long time.	1
ClaimBuster	8358				The disagreement I have with Governor Romney is that, during the course of this campaign, he's often talked as if we should take premature military action.	1
ClaimBuster	8359				The way I see it, the world is getting much closer together.	0
ClaimBuster	8360				We cannot move to the extreme.	0
ClaimBuster	8361				I remember when the stories first came out about the stops in New Jersey by the highway patrol there.	0
ClaimBuster	8362				They're growing at 8 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	8363				So what we've got to do is control it, let it grow for inflation, let it grow for the amount of new people added, population, and then hold the line.	0
ClaimBuster	8364				Then I'm going to have a top down review at the Pentagon, not a bottom up review.	0
ClaimBuster	8365				And like John McCain, I have learned from experience, and it's not a new position for me.	0
ClaimBuster	8366				I have a clear record of reaching across the aisle, whether it be Joe Lieberman or Russ Feingold or Ted Kennedy or others.	1
ClaimBuster	8367				And the kind of defense program that Mr. Carter wants will mean a weaker defense and a poor negotiating position.	0
ClaimBuster	8368				The president said by now we'd be a 5.4 percent unemployment.	1
ClaimBuster	8369				I want to make sure take-home pay turns around and starts to grow.	0
ClaimBuster	8370				I want to be the best president I can be for every American.	0
ClaimBuster	8371				So I'd like to ask you right now, why don't you give back the money that you've taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly?	0
ClaimBuster	8372				They're going to start hiring people.	0
ClaimBuster	8373				And actually -- well, that was very interesting.	0
ClaimBuster	8374				Mr. Ford has vetoed four times as many bills as Mr. Nixon - per year.	1
ClaimBuster	8375				You had loan officers were -- that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn't have been given, because the folks didn't qualify.	1
ClaimBuster	8376				That's pennies on the dollar compared to renewing the cold war.	0
ClaimBuster	8377				We're moving into a new competitive age, and we need that kind of thing.	0
ClaimBuster	8378				We still have trillion-dollar deficits.	1
ClaimBuster	8379				And there are a host of options that this president had available to him, like making sure that at all our ports in America containers are inspected.	0
ClaimBuster	8380				To go into a Catholic mass in a beautiful cathedral in New York under the cause of helping in AIDS and start throwing condoms around in the mass, I'm sorry, I think it sets back the cause.	0
ClaimBuster	8381				You're not going to go without food and you're not going to go without medical care.	0
ClaimBuster	8382				These women -- the woman on the plane, the -- I think they want either fame or her campaign did it.	0
ClaimBuster	8383				A great big company can buy -- Ross has got a good-sized company, been very successful.	1
ClaimBuster	8384				Georgia in particular is now on the brink of enormous economic challenges.	0
ClaimBuster	8385				Jim, there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer.	0
ClaimBuster	8386				That's what he said the other day, and that's simply not the case.	1
ClaimBuster	8387				And you need to know the record here.	0
ClaimBuster	8388				I'm thinking of Ross Perot's running mate sitting in the jail.	0
ClaimBuster	8389				Look, when we think about immigration, we have to understand there are folks all around the world who still see America as the land of promise.	0
ClaimBuster	8390				Maybe I am, but I just don't think that's right.	0
ClaimBuster	8391				I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people.	1
ClaimBuster	8392				Give them a tax moratorium for a period if they build and develop there.	0
ClaimBuster	8393				Former chief of the -- Joint Chiefs of Staff said that -- Admiral Mullen said that our debt is the biggest national security threat we face.	1
ClaimBuster	8394				But that's as far as I would go with it.	0
ClaimBuster	8395				What were her written instructions?	0
ClaimBuster	8396				In spite of the economic problems, we're the most respected economy around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	8397				That, to me, is the key.	0
ClaimBuster	8398				But I feel strongly that marriage should be between a man and a woman.	0
ClaimBuster	8399				I have a plan for that.	0
ClaimBuster	8400				That is not free trade.	0
ClaimBuster	8401				And I want seniors to have additional choices when it comes to choosing their health care plans.	0
ClaimBuster	8402				Whenever a weapon is tested we count the number of warheads on it, and whenever that warhead is used we count that number of warheads, whether they have that number or less on it, or not.	1
ClaimBuster	8403				And I think that's shocking; it's shameful.	0
ClaimBuster	8404				You need to test every year.	0
ClaimBuster	8405				Now, it's our turn to take that torch.	0
ClaimBuster	8406				That's the kind of leadership that we'll continue to show.	0
ClaimBuster	8407				His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information.	1
ClaimBuster	8408				I disagree with much of what she's fighting for.	0
ClaimBuster	8409				I mean, he's also a strong ally in the war on terror.	0
ClaimBuster	8410				We have the greatest businesspeople in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	8411				I have cut defense spending.	1
ClaimBuster	8412				In my own state, we did it.	1
ClaimBuster	8413				But I do not believe that that line in case of war should be drawn on those islands but instead on the island of Formosa.	0
ClaimBuster	8414				And I saw families there who showed me there where missiles had come down near their children's bedrooms.	1
ClaimBuster	8415				And I wonder if it's our fault, the candidates' fault.	0
ClaimBuster	8416				It doesn't mean that you invite them over for tea one day.	0
ClaimBuster	8417				Well, Jim, first of all, I would like to thank the sponsors of this debate and the people of Boston for hosting the debate.	0
ClaimBuster	8418				Ambassador, anybody on my team would play politics or mislead when we've lost four of our own, governor, is offensive.	0
ClaimBuster	8419				I think it's important to promote a culture of life.	0
ClaimBuster	8420				In eight years they haven't gotten anything done on Medicare, on Social Security, a patient's bill of rights.	0
ClaimBuster	8421				We don't need across-the-board tax cuts for the wealthy for nothing.	0
ClaimBuster	8422				And the last point I wanna make is this: Mr. Ford, Mr. Kissinger have uh - continued on with the policies and failures of Richard Nixon.	0
ClaimBuster	8423				I know Americans had seen jobs being shipped overseas; businesses and workers not getting a level playing field when it came to trade.	1
ClaimBuster	8424				-- because if the American people send me there, we'll get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	8425				But now we've got the lines too carefully drawn here.	0
ClaimBuster	8426				I refer, for example, to distressed areas.	0
ClaimBuster	8427				It wasn't me that was there at that convention.	1
ClaimBuster	8428				The governor is the chief executive officer.	1
ClaimBuster	8429				Over the last 15, over the last 20 years.	0
ClaimBuster	8430				This is an issue that divides America, but certainly reasonable people can agree on how to reduce abortions in America.	0
ClaimBuster	8431				In this particular situation, no.	0
ClaimBuster	8432				You know, I've been privileged to see the presidency up close.	1
ClaimBuster	8433				Now, I have talked to the chairmen of the committees that want this.	1
ClaimBuster	8434				So what I'm trying to do is just talk the truth to the American people and to the world.	0
ClaimBuster	8435				This is a -- this is an important election and I'm concerned about America.	0
ClaimBuster	8436				There are some things that I think have to be done.	0
ClaimBuster	8437				You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.	1
ClaimBuster	8438				But I can take it.	0
ClaimBuster	8439				You have a differential in wages right now.	1
ClaimBuster	8440				When he talks about getting tough on China, keep in mind that Governor Romney invested in companies that were pioneers of outsourcing to China, and is currently investing in countries -- in companies that are building surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks.	1
ClaimBuster	8441				He always talks about Arkansas having a balanced budget and they do, but he has a balanced budget amendment.	1
ClaimBuster	8442				But on the other hand, I found on July fourth of this year, a new spirit born in America.	0
ClaimBuster	8443				I'm very glad to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	8444				And I'm convinced now, more than I was when I got the nomination, that Walter Mondale was the right choice, And I believe this is a good indication of the kind of people I would choose in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	8445				Well, I've heard -- I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country.	0
ClaimBuster	8446				It will not be a re-ignition of the Cold War, but Russia is a challenge.	0
ClaimBuster	8447				We found the people who could least afford it - people on retired incomes uh - people on fixed incomes - we found them unable to meet their bills at the end of the month.	1
ClaimBuster	8448				Well, everything you've heard just now from Donald is not true.	1
ClaimBuster	8449				And that's why it's going to be so important for us to work with homeowners to make sure that they can stay in their homes.	0
ClaimBuster	8450				You've had a number of occasions to see in detail what the plan is, and at least you'll understand it.	1
ClaimBuster	8451				He wanted that said -- 4 years.	1
ClaimBuster	8452				And I'm happy to talk to you, Joe, too, if you're out there.	0
ClaimBuster	8453				And we face -- this deficit could crush the future generations.	0
ClaimBuster	8454				What I think we need, however, is not just that but to move forward, not just congratulating ourselves but challenging ourselves to get on with the business of dealing with America's problems.	0
ClaimBuster	8455				"We're also going to have to work with the Karzai government, and when I met with President Karzai, I was very clear that, ""You are going to have to do better by your people in order for us to gain the popular support that's necessary."""	1
ClaimBuster	8456				They just wouldn't do it, and everybody now knows the terrible price they're paying by waiting until it's obvious to the brain-dead that they have problems.	0
ClaimBuster	8457				And if they can't do it, if the Congress can't do it, let them then have to do it across the board.	0
ClaimBuster	8458				Well among my other experiences in the past, I've - I've been a nuclear engineer, and did graduate work in this field.	1
ClaimBuster	8459				If my recollection is correct he indicated that uh - General Brown was not qualified to be a sewer commissioner.	0
ClaimBuster	8460				We were together at a humorous event a little earlier, and it's nice to maybe funny this time, not on purpose.	1
ClaimBuster	8461				I believe we need some fairness.	0
ClaimBuster	8462				I would like to stand here and promise the American people a tax cut, as Governor Reagan has done.	0
ClaimBuster	8463				Of course we're worried about Osama bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	8464				They've never seen anything happen in that town.	0
ClaimBuster	8465				They're all nice people, they're just in a bad system.	0
ClaimBuster	8466				Let me s- look also at what I did.	0
ClaimBuster	8467				And in the term that I've been president - some two years - we have reduced federal employment by eleven thousand.	1
ClaimBuster	8468				That is not a recipe for growth.	0
ClaimBuster	8469				Every time I had a vacancy on the Georgia Supreme Court - and I filled five of those vacancies out of seven total and about half the court of appeals judges, about 35 percent of the trial judges - I was given from an objective panel the five most highly qualified persons in Georgia.	1
ClaimBuster	8470				I think we can do that in a way that represents what America is all about, which is equal opportunity and an opportunity for people to realize their potential.	0
ClaimBuster	8471				I want workers to have their own assets.	0
ClaimBuster	8472				There are several things that can be done specifically that are not now being done.	0
ClaimBuster	8473				I ask you for your trust.	0
ClaimBuster	8474				Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle, and before he did it, he said, watch my choice for vice president, it will tell all And it sure did.	1
ClaimBuster	8475				You need somebody working for you and you've got to have somebody in Washington who is thinking about the middle class and not just those who can afford to hire lobbyists.	0
ClaimBuster	8476				You know, Moammar Gadhafi had more American blood on his hands than any individual other than Osama bin Laden.	1
ClaimBuster	8477				And so if you believe the same thing, you just don't want to raise taxes on people.	0
ClaimBuster	8478				I think that we have to return -- particularly in defense spending, which is the largest part of our appropriations -- we have to do away with cost-plus contracts.	0
ClaimBuster	8479				It's going to be a test of our strength.	0
ClaimBuster	8480				The United States foreign policy under this administration has been one of progress and success.	0
ClaimBuster	8481				You stay around this long enough, you think about -- if you talk about it in Washington, you think you did it.	0
ClaimBuster	8482				The bill originally covered employers of 25 and more, but because of opposition, we went up to 50.	1
ClaimBuster	8483				It's a remarkable thing in a country like ours, a man who grew up in Russell, Kansas, and one who was born to a widowed mother in Hope, Arkansas, could wind up running for president.	0
ClaimBuster	8484				And you supported legislation this year that's involved tax increases not once, but twice.	1
ClaimBuster	8485				"I knew we'd have somebody out there yelling ""read my lips"", and I did it because I thought it was right."	0
ClaimBuster	8486				The history of our relationship with Iran goes back to the days of President Truman when he decided that it was vitally necessary for our own security as well as that of Iran, that we should help that country, and Iran has been a good ally.	1
ClaimBuster	8487				Now when Governor Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt.	0
ClaimBuster	8488				And we'll have time to deal with the long-term problems of the baby boomers.	0
ClaimBuster	8489				No, I don't happen to share that goal.	0
ClaimBuster	8490				We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake.	0
ClaimBuster	8491				According to one study that was published a short time ago - the Harvard Business School study - indicated that just in the commercial sector alone of the economy, we could save between 30% and 40% of the energy that we consume in this country today.	1
ClaimBuster	8492				Because people shouldn't be taxed twice on their assets.	0
ClaimBuster	8493				We're encouraging it and working with the industry.	1
ClaimBuster	8494				And that's a big, big factor.	0
ClaimBuster	8495				And we will have a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent.	0
ClaimBuster	8496				So what I don't know is what the unexpected will be.	0
ClaimBuster	8497				That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	8498				Working together, we can do wonderful things for the United States and the Free World.	0
ClaimBuster	8499				I don't know what the differences might be, because I don't know what Mr. Carter's policies are.	0
ClaimBuster	8500				The federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy.	1
ClaimBuster	8501				If you don't agree, if you don't think that this course that we've been on for the last four years is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have.	0
ClaimBuster	8502				And yet she didn't know the word -- the letter C on a document.	1
ClaimBuster	8503				And you know, afterwards, we spent a lot of time with them.	1
ClaimBuster	8504				"Faith without works is dead. """	0
ClaimBuster	8505				Well, we have a tradition of local control of the schools and that's a tradition that has served us well.	1
ClaimBuster	8506				And the rest of my minute, I want to make a very brief comment here in terms of Saddam Hussein.	0
ClaimBuster	8507				People care a lot about their land and care about their environment.	0
ClaimBuster	8508				And if it's rape, how do you draw moral judgments on that?	0
ClaimBuster	8509				Khan network has been brought to justice.	1
ClaimBuster	8510				I see our influence receding, in part because of the failure of the president to deal with our economic challenges at home; in part because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military in the way I think it ought to be; in part because of the -- the -- the turmoil with Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	8511				Part of that is because we've stood still here at home, because we haven't met our problems in the United States, because we haven't had a moving economy.	0
ClaimBuster	8512				So, that was the only place that that was used.	1
ClaimBuster	8513				I went to college in this great city, and most of my peers felt against the war as I did.	1
ClaimBuster	8514				So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages.	1
ClaimBuster	8515				Because this is the stimulation, the incentive for companies to go out and explore for oil, to develop it.	0
ClaimBuster	8516				Anything that would preserve, or help us use less energy, that would be fine, and I'm for it.	0
ClaimBuster	8517				And the difference between Arkansas and the US is that we're going in the right direction and this country's going in the wrong direction.	0
ClaimBuster	8518				Now it's lower than the nine-point-point-two percent growth in the first quarter, and it's lower than the uh 5 percent growth in the second quarter.	1
ClaimBuster	8519				There is a considerable anti-Washington feeling throughout the country.	0
ClaimBuster	8520				Not because we coddled them, but because the Administration was pushed into doing something about it.	0
ClaimBuster	8521				When you stop and think that we are only drilling on 2%.	1
ClaimBuster	8522				Is Iran talking to Iraq about peace?	0
ClaimBuster	8523				Prime Minister Allawi believes they want to.	0
ClaimBuster	8524				We like free enterprise, but you got to play by the rules.	0
ClaimBuster	8525				And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case.	1
ClaimBuster	8526				But there have been too many instances during the course of my presidency, where I've had to comfort families who have lost somebody.	1
ClaimBuster	8527				But this president didn't try to fix it.	1
ClaimBuster	8528				What we got to do is keep working, as the Labor Dept is doing a first-class job on, to break down discrimination, to break down the glass ceiling.	1
ClaimBuster	8529				He was furious because he told me that it was the action of me, President Ford, that saved the lives of the crew of the Mayaguez.	1
ClaimBuster	8530				So did Governor Thompson, so did Governor Rowland.	1
ClaimBuster	8531				I'm sure I'll do it before it's over.	0
ClaimBuster	8532				Those stem- cells lines already existed.	1
ClaimBuster	8533				But if you're going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be determined by states in localities where they're raising and spending most of the money.	0
ClaimBuster	8534				And you've confirmed once again the fundamental decency and generosity of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	8535				I also want to go to Washington to get some positive things done.	0
ClaimBuster	8536				I supported him on NAFTA and GATT.	1
ClaimBuster	8537				The Vice President's plan does not have annual accountability, third grade, fourth grade, fifth grade.	1
ClaimBuster	8538				And I've got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party.	0
ClaimBuster	8539				I could have gone on forever.	0
ClaimBuster	8540				Believe me, people with AIDS are more than willing to take that risk.	0
ClaimBuster	8541				And that kind of credibility is precisely why we've been able to show leadership on a wide range of issues facing the world right now.	0
ClaimBuster	8542				I -- I think the tension that existed between Israel and the United States was very unfortunate.	0
ClaimBuster	8543				I think we have to do is invest in American jobs, American education, control American health care costs and bring the American people together again.	0
ClaimBuster	8544				Certainly we can find a coffeepot that costs something less than $7,000.	1
ClaimBuster	8545				But personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that.	0
ClaimBuster	8546				We now have one extreme for instance, of some welfare recipients, who by taking advantage of the welfare laws, the housing laws, the uh - Medicaid uh - laws, and the uh - food stamp laws, make over $10 thousand a year and uh - they don't have to pay any taxes on it.	1
ClaimBuster	8547				Now, in contrast, Senator McCain wants to give a $300 billion tax cut, $200 billion of it to the largest corporations and a hundred thousand of it -- a hundred billion of it going to people like CEOs on Wall Street.	1
ClaimBuster	8548				And number three, we are going to find out who did this and we're going to hunt them down, because one of the things that I've said throughout my presidency is when folks mess with Americans, we go after them.	0
ClaimBuster	8549				And as far as the absolute gap is concerned, we find that the United States is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	8550				We've got a - a sharp distinction drawn between white collar crime - the - the - the big shots who are rich, who are influential uh very seldom go to jail; those who are poor and - and who have uh no influence - uh quite often are the ones who are punished.	0
ClaimBuster	8551				I do hope you will read our plans.	0
ClaimBuster	8552				And the confidence that those countries recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops there.	0
ClaimBuster	8553				And as the governor of Massachusetts knows, there was no evidence that governor - that Mr. Noriega was involved in drugs, no hard evidence until we indicted him.	1
ClaimBuster	8554				One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12.	1
ClaimBuster	8555				I do not believe in cutting our military.	0
ClaimBuster	8556				And, unfortunately, Governor Romney's budget and his proposals would not allow us to make those investments.	0
ClaimBuster	8557				But by itself, that to me can bring into play a fundamental American strategic interest because I think it's based on our values.	0
ClaimBuster	8558				By 1965 or 1970, will there be other Cubas in Latin America?	0
ClaimBuster	8559				We just have a big difference on where this country should be led, and in what direction it ought to go.	0
ClaimBuster	8560				I - I have to say that my campaign has been an open one.	0
ClaimBuster	8561				When a drug comes in from Canada, I want to make sure it cures you and doesn't kill you.	0
ClaimBuster	8562				But it's not a statement about his heart.	0
ClaimBuster	8563				But it was a calculated risk that paid off.	0
ClaimBuster	8564				But I also believe that everybody should have a fair shot and everybody should do their fair share and everybody should play by the same rules, because that's how our economy's grown.	0
ClaimBuster	8565				He refers to one tax increase.	1
ClaimBuster	8566				Well, the president and his experts have told America that it's not a question of if; it's a question of when.	1
ClaimBuster	8567				We're not going to allow Iran to perpetually engage in negotiations that lead nowhere.	0
ClaimBuster	8568				And I've never discussed Whitewater, as I've told you personally.	1
ClaimBuster	8569				If someday, somebody comes along with an answer, that's something else.	0
ClaimBuster	8570				And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who's her friend and not a good guy, by the way.	1
ClaimBuster	8571				I've heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible.	0
ClaimBuster	8572				And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities.	0
ClaimBuster	8573				But even more importantly, you worry about the future and will they have the same opportunities that you and I have had.	0
ClaimBuster	8574				We both made promises in this campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	8575				The one major decision that I have made since acquiring the nomination, and I share this with President Ford, is the choice of a vice president.	0
ClaimBuster	8576				And they don't want this deadly new effort to bring weapons into the heavens.	0
ClaimBuster	8577				They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants.	0
ClaimBuster	8578				And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments.	1
ClaimBuster	8579				I gave you back some of that time.	0
ClaimBuster	8580				We were threatened by a veto if we passed a dollar and a quarter - it's extremely difficult with the great power that the president does to pass any bill when the president is opposed to it.	1
ClaimBuster	8581				I consider myself in the mainstream of my party.	0
ClaimBuster	8582				I want to move forward, I want this nation to move forward.	0
ClaimBuster	8583				This man has been disparaging my plan with all this Washington fuzzy math.	0
ClaimBuster	8584				Every President who has served in the Oval Office since Harry Truman has been dedicated to the proposition of controlling nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	8585				So you've got to create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	8586				Let's get to their questions.	0
ClaimBuster	8587				And I think there may be a couple of reasons.	0
ClaimBuster	8588				You can be on welfare.	0
ClaimBuster	8589				People will be able to take their HMO insurance company to court.	0
ClaimBuster	8590				You should not in the process penalize the legitimate handgun owner.	0
ClaimBuster	8591				We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess.	1
ClaimBuster	8592				They're doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.	0
ClaimBuster	8593				Now, she can say that her husband did well, but, boy, did they suffer as NAFTA kicked in, because it didn't really kick in very much, but it kicked in after they left.	0
ClaimBuster	8594				It's a difference between government making decisions for you and you getting more of your money to make decisions for yourself.	1
ClaimBuster	8595				And, Candy, we haven't had a chance to talk about education much, but I think it is very important to understand that the reforms we've put in place, working with 46 governors around the country, are seeing schools that are some of the ones that are the toughest for kids starting to succeed.	1
ClaimBuster	8596				First, I've suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we don't need and we can't afford.	0
ClaimBuster	8597				The other thing is that we have only leased out - begun to explore - 2% of our outer continental shelf for oil, where it is believed, by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy, that there are vast supplies yet to be found.	1
ClaimBuster	8598				And my opponent's plans lead me to conclude that Saddam Hussein would still be in power, and the world would be more dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	8599				I wanna see our nation - return to a posture and an image and a standard to make us proud once again.	0
ClaimBuster	8600				And then we had a recession and we got attacked, which cost us 1 million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	8601				And the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they aren't making seniors any healthier.	1
ClaimBuster	8602				It hasn't worked out that way.	0
ClaimBuster	8603				Senator Obama is the chairperson of a committee that oversights NATO that's in Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	8604				My opponent thought there was weapons there.	0
ClaimBuster	8605				A half a million manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last four years.	1
ClaimBuster	8606				I believe that I can't legislate or transfer to another American citizen my article of faith.	0
ClaimBuster	8607				It contains twenty-five percent of all the members of the General Assembly.	1
ClaimBuster	8608				And that is why, in this field, I have made recommendations which I am confident will move the American economy ahead - move it firmly and soundly so that there will never be a time when the Soviet Union will be able to challenge our superiority in this field.	0
ClaimBuster	8609				I think we -- I think we should make it the number one priority to make our schools the best in the world, all of them.	0
ClaimBuster	8610				Because someone didn't meet exactly our standards of human rights, even though they were an ally of ours, instead of trying patiently to persuade them to change their ways, we have, in a number of instances, aided a revolutionary overthrow which results in complete totalitarianism, instead, for those people.	1
ClaimBuster	8611				I think this is a very important moment for our country.	0
ClaimBuster	8612				One of the major issues in this campaign is trust.	0
ClaimBuster	8613				And if we don't act today, the problem will be valued in the trillions.	0
ClaimBuster	8614				If you're poor, they pay all of it.	1
ClaimBuster	8615				I did it as a security measure to be sure, because I would rather see us reduce the consumption of imported oil than have to send American boys to fight in the Persian Gulf.	0
ClaimBuster	8616				We have reduced the military manpower by a million four hundred thousand.	1
ClaimBuster	8617				I know how to get him.	0
ClaimBuster	8618				Senator Obama has $800 billion in new spending programs.	1
ClaimBuster	8619				We better get it right now.	0
ClaimBuster	8620				Senator Obama wants to set up health care bureaucracies, take over the health care of America through -- as he said, his object is a single payer system.	1
ClaimBuster	8621				Now, remember, folks, even Senator Dole's campaign co-chair here, Senator D'Amato, says he's got to cut Medicare to pay for this.	1
ClaimBuster	8622				conservative projections out for the next five years, that indicates that this plan would, by 1983, result in a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	8623				They had thirty of them; we had seven of them.	1
ClaimBuster	8624				He's 3 years into this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	8625				If you throw another 50,000 kids on the street because of cutting recklessly in troop levels, you're going to put a lot more out of work.	0
ClaimBuster	8626				But I think it's unconscionable, Ann, that we should be talking or thinking about imposing new taxes on average Americans when there are billions out there, over $100 billion, in taxes owed that aren't being paid.	1
ClaimBuster	8627				And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	8628				Thank you for your question.	0
ClaimBuster	8629				Look, 95 percent of our containers coming into this country are not inspected today.	1
ClaimBuster	8630				Freedom is on the march.	0
ClaimBuster	8631				That's Washington in a nutshell right there.	0
ClaimBuster	8632				Now, our relations with Pakistan are critical, because the border areas are being used as safe havens by the Taliban and Al Qaida and other extremist organizations, and we have to get their support.	1
ClaimBuster	8633				It caused me to disrupt my private life and my business to get involved in this activity.	0
ClaimBuster	8634				The key is making sure that the next treasury secretary understands that it's not enough just to help those at the top.	0
ClaimBuster	8635				I think that's a big mistake, because I think we have to stay at the cutting edge.	0
ClaimBuster	8636				First, we've had Muslims in America since George Washington.	1
ClaimBuster	8637				And to take a chance uh - now be - and not make every effort that we could make to provide for some control over these weapons, I think would be a great mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	8638				And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting.	0
ClaimBuster	8639				And I am convinced that my record, going back to my opposition from sending the Marines to Lebanon, to supporting our efforts in Kosovo and Bosnia and the first Gulf War, and my judgment, I think, is something that I'm -- a record that I'm willing to stand on.	1
ClaimBuster	8640				He better not be or there's going to be a consequence should I be the president.	0
ClaimBuster	8641				And then you've got to fix it and do something with it.	0
ClaimBuster	8642				The report following the explosion of the barracks disclosed that we had not taken any of the steps that we should have taken.	1
ClaimBuster	8643				And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from.	1
ClaimBuster	8644				We'll continue to reach out.	0
ClaimBuster	8645				And that's just a fact.	1
ClaimBuster	8646				But let me simply say for the record, I did not vote to cut COLAs.	1
ClaimBuster	8647				He called the Arizona law a model for the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	8648				But she's lied about a lot of things.	1
ClaimBuster	8649				I want to be very serious.	0
ClaimBuster	8650				On the other hand, uh when you have a bill of that magnitude, with - tho- those many provisions, a president has to sit and decide if there's more good than bad.	0
ClaimBuster	8651				And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.	0
ClaimBuster	8652				It was the Reagan-Bush administration that brought this man to justice.	1
ClaimBuster	8653				But over time, what they can do is regain credibility.	0
ClaimBuster	8654				We can, in other words, negotiate many of these items of difference between us without going to the summit.	0
ClaimBuster	8655				And the sooner they start, the sooner they'll finish.	0
ClaimBuster	8656				The Arab boycott action was first taken in 1952.	1
ClaimBuster	8657				I want to say just a couple of things.	0
ClaimBuster	8658				We're spending about $7 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	8659				He had the capability of making weapons, and he would have made weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	8660				One of his bills that was overridden - he only got one vote in the Senate and seven votes in the House, from Republicans.	1
ClaimBuster	8661				The secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating.	1
ClaimBuster	8662				We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.	1
ClaimBuster	8663				And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.	0
ClaimBuster	8664				And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do...	0
ClaimBuster	8665				But certainly we're not going to have peace by giving in and indicating in advance that we are not going to defend what has become a symbol of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	8666				And we pushed our allies aside.	0
ClaimBuster	8667				We need to sit down and reauthorize it.	0
ClaimBuster	8668				We didn't even have a Bureau of African Affairs until 1957.	1
ClaimBuster	8669				But instead, we've seen in nation after nation, a number of disturbing events.	0
ClaimBuster	8670				But I think there is also a national responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	8671				I -- I'm -- I feel very deeply sympathetic for the families of those who lost loved ones.	0
ClaimBuster	8672				But you isolate China and turn them inward, and then we've made a tremendous mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	8673				That's the only way you can bring real economic pressure on the Castro regime - and also the countries of Western Europe, Canada, Japan and the others.	0
ClaimBuster	8674				Whether it's two parents working because one has to pay the taxes and one has to provide for the family, whether it's a single parent who just barely pays the pressing bills or whether you're worried about an education for your children going to the best schools, or whether you're worried about safe playgrounds, drug-free schools, crime-free schools.	0
ClaimBuster	8675				Because the deficit now has been building up for 12 years.	1
ClaimBuster	8676				It's much less than that.	1
ClaimBuster	8677				And I try to do a lot of things that I think might be helpful to people.	0
ClaimBuster	8678				And if they don't, they wind up in prison.	0
ClaimBuster	8679				And we can do so in an environmentally friendly way.	0
ClaimBuster	8680				So there are a lot of good things in this bill we should have done instead of trying this massive, massive takeover by the Federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	8681				Senator Obama voted against Justice Breyer and Justice Roberts on the grounds that they didn't meet his ideological standards.	1
ClaimBuster	8682				We have this incredible prosperity, but a lot of people have been left behind.	1
ClaimBuster	8683				If I could respond, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	8684				I don't want to kill jobs in this environment.	0
ClaimBuster	8685				And may God continue to bless our great land.	0
ClaimBuster	8686				We've had a chance to spell out our differences on the Pledge of Allegiance here tonight and on tough sentencing of drug king pins and this kind of thing.	0
ClaimBuster	8687				But we were far stronger relative to the Communists five years ago, and what is of great concern is that the balance of power is in danger of moving with them.	1
ClaimBuster	8688				You can pull it off of the Internet.	0
ClaimBuster	8689				If you want to help somebody, don't run the costs up by making doctors have to have 5 or 6 tests where one would do for fear of being sued, or have somebody along the highway not stop to pick up a guy and help him because he's afraid a trial lawyer will come along and sue him.	0
ClaimBuster	8690				I just told you the criteria on which I'll appoint judges.	1
ClaimBuster	8691				Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I -- if I'm fortunate...	0
ClaimBuster	8692				More people are working harder for less, 100,000 people a month losing their health insurance, unemployment going up, our economy slowing down.	1
ClaimBuster	8693				Well, the primary responsibility for education is -- is, of course, at the state and local level.	0
ClaimBuster	8694				The United States must be a nation strong; the United States must be a nation secure.	0
ClaimBuster	8695				There is no way you can be strong militarily and have those kind of reductions in our military uh - appropriation.	0
ClaimBuster	8696				We can't afford that in the next eight years and Senator Obama, with the Democrats in charge of Congress, things have gotten worse.	0
ClaimBuster	8697				For the first time in history, you pay about 40 percent of what you earn.	1
ClaimBuster	8698				Got a Republican Congress cutting spending finally and he said it's the best four years ever.	1
ClaimBuster	8699				We'll do exactly what we did in the 1990s.	0
ClaimBuster	8700				Now as far as the balance of the world is concerned, I of course don't have as much time as Senator Kennedy had.	0
ClaimBuster	8701				"And I said, ""How many uh - adults here are out of work?"""	1
ClaimBuster	8702				I just disagree with Mr. Perot.	0
ClaimBuster	8703				I want to give people permanent incentives on investment tax credit, like President Kennedy and the Congress inaugurated in the early '60s to get industry moving again; a research and development tax credit; a low-income housing tax credit; a long-term capital gains proposal for new business and business expansions.	1
ClaimBuster	8704				The uh - fact is that secrecy has surrounded the decisions made by the Ford administration.	0
ClaimBuster	8705				And it's just predicated on very modest, but I think accurate, projections of employment increases and uh - a growth in our national economy equal to what was experienced under Kennedy, Johnson, before the Vietnam War.	0
ClaimBuster	8706				But if we snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and adopt Senator Obama's plan, then we will have a wider war and it will make things more complicated throughout the region, including in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	8707				Governor Reagan, again, typically is against such a proposal.	0
ClaimBuster	8708				But I can guarantee it will not come if Gerald Ford is reelected and this present policy is continued; it will come if I'm elected.	0
ClaimBuster	8709				And let me make another observation.	0
ClaimBuster	8710				But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	8711				That's the decision of the next president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	8712				"Six months after he said Osama bin Laden must be caught dead or alive, this president was asked, ""Where is Osama bin Laden? """	1
ClaimBuster	8713				"What Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that if without precondition you sit down across the table from someone who has called Israel a ""stinking corpse,"" and wants to destroy that country and wipe it off the map, you legitimize those comments."	0
ClaimBuster	8714				One of the problems, I think, at the time of South Korea was the question of whether the United States would defend it if it were attacked.	0
ClaimBuster	8715				A lot of decent, honorable people felt as he did on the draft.	1
ClaimBuster	8716				Like you, I'm concerned about the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	8717				And in our country we have evolved to a point where we've put millions of innocent people in jail because you go to the poor neighborhoods and they've put bars on their windows and bars on their doors and put themselves in jail to protect the things that they acquired legitimately.	0
ClaimBuster	8718				Now, two-thirds of the people in this country who receive Social Security checks live entirely on that check; they have no other income.	1
ClaimBuster	8719				It's going to help jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	8720				Now I didn't make most of the statements that you said I made.	0
ClaimBuster	8721				So we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	8722				And I saw the cocaine scene treated with humor, as though this was a humorous little incident.	1
ClaimBuster	8723				The Democratic party in this century has stood for something.	0
ClaimBuster	8724				So I'm pledged to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	8725				They discover great new cures and that's great.	1
ClaimBuster	8726				Well it, after World War I, we had, you know, a policy of disengagement.	1
ClaimBuster	8727				You also have investments through a Cayman's trust.	1
ClaimBuster	8728				Our nation is involved in two wars, and we are going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	8729				No, but let me just stay to the American people in 2 and a half weeks we're going to choose who should sit in this Oval Office, who to lead the economic recovery, who to be the leader of the free world, who to get the deficit down.	1
ClaimBuster	8730				They hack into our computers.	1
ClaimBuster	8731				The criminal is not going to show up and say hey, give me my I.D.	0
ClaimBuster	8732				And it's the president's fiscal policies that have driven up the biggest deficits in American history.	1
ClaimBuster	8733				General Ridgway has said the same thing.	1
ClaimBuster	8734				But we've got to enforce the laws, which is what we are doing, and we've also got to make sure that in every walk of life we do not tolerate discrimination.	0
ClaimBuster	8735				That is a very strong incentive that we've given them to do the right thing.	0
ClaimBuster	8736				He and I used to have arguments about the war.	1
ClaimBuster	8737				It's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.	0
ClaimBuster	8738				Number three, we're going to have to have training programs that work for our workers and schools that finally put the parents and the teachers and the kids first, and the teachers' unions going to have to go behind.	0
ClaimBuster	8739				It's not in our national interest to use force in this case.	0
ClaimBuster	8740				Now let me come directly to your question.	0
ClaimBuster	8741				Well, you establish respect for differences.	0
ClaimBuster	8742				Look, we are sending $700 billion a year overseas to countries that don't like us very much.	1
ClaimBuster	8743				National security and human rights must go together.	0
ClaimBuster	8744				And if we do that, if we do what I'm planning on doing, which is getting us energy independent, North America energy independence within eight years, you're going to see manufacturing jobs come back.	0
ClaimBuster	8745				And never forget, they've got Airbus over there, and it's a government-owned, privately owned, consortium across Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	8746				At that time, nobody thought I had a chance to win.	0
ClaimBuster	8747				And so I don't know what the answer is.	0
ClaimBuster	8748				And inflation went down below the national average in California when we returned the money to the people and reduced Government spending.	1
ClaimBuster	8749				We tried to build a little ship called the Littoral Combat Ship that was supposed to cost $140 million, ended up costing $400 million, and we still haven't done it.	1
ClaimBuster	8750				We have a gentleman down in Nicaragua who is on contract to the CIA, advising -- supposedly on military tactics -- the contras.	1
ClaimBuster	8751				Now, that's not my analysis.	0
ClaimBuster	8752				Try and get a mortgage these days.	0
ClaimBuster	8753				We're also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip.	1
ClaimBuster	8754				I'll just give you one quick example.	0
ClaimBuster	8755				It could also be lots of other people.	0
ClaimBuster	8756				And I think that this is what we should concentrate on, is trying -- I know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee, there were medical authorities, there were religious -- there were clerics there -- everyone talking about this matter of prolife.	0
ClaimBuster	8757				You see all these ads?	0
ClaimBuster	8758				17 new taxes, price controls, 50 new bureaucracies.	1
ClaimBuster	8759				I work with Director Mueller of the FBI; comes in my office when I'm in Washington every morning, talking about how to protect us.	1
ClaimBuster	8760				Now there are three crimes for every policeman.	1
ClaimBuster	8761				And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.	0
ClaimBuster	8762				We need to have as well a strong military.	0
ClaimBuster	8763				If I ever decided to impose an embargo because of a crisis in international relationships, it would include all shipments of all equipment.	0
ClaimBuster	8764				I'm fighting for the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	8765				I mean, you've got to care.	0
ClaimBuster	8766				To the millions of fine decent people who did the unthinkable and took their country back in their own hands and put me on the ballot, let me pledge to you that tonight is just the beginning.	0
ClaimBuster	8767				And I've had conversations with him.	1
ClaimBuster	8768				But I just have to...	0
ClaimBuster	8769				And I am going to do it in a way that's fiscally sound.	0
ClaimBuster	8770				Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?	0
ClaimBuster	8771				If you have a child, you got tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	8772				I want to empower the people.	0
ClaimBuster	8773				Second, in the field of schools, we believe that there should be provisions whereby the federal government would give assistance to those districts who do want to integrate their schools.	0
ClaimBuster	8774				As a matter of fact, Mexico, itself, is one of our biggest agricultural customers, so in the sense that we can work to help Mexico rebuild and expand and deal with these very serious economic problems we help our farmers at the same time.	1
ClaimBuster	8775				It's one of the major priorities of my administration.	0
ClaimBuster	8776				This one concerned uh - Great Britain.	0
ClaimBuster	8777				Make sure that you are getting a good paying job, making sure that Medicare and Social Security... (CROSSTALK)	0
ClaimBuster	8778				What happened to the FBI, I don't know.	0
ClaimBuster	8779				Look at that horrible -- these are radical Islamic terrorists.	1
ClaimBuster	8780				At the present time we're spending roughly three billion five hundred million dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	8781				So I just left some high representatives of India.	1
ClaimBuster	8782				We all agreed it would be a pretty dull place.	0
ClaimBuster	8783				Most people are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	8784				We either have -- and by the way...	0
ClaimBuster	8785				Look, we can attack health care and energy at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	8786				"I went to a number of women's groups and said, ""Can you help us find folks,"" and they brought us whole binders full of women."	1
ClaimBuster	8787				That was a tragic mistake that we made, a mistake that Mr. Bush made and others made and it should never ever be made again.	0
ClaimBuster	8788				You've gone up 64 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	8789				It's gone up by $2,500 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	8790				And yes, I think it's something that people need to consider.	0
ClaimBuster	8791				Another example would be the Dred Scott case, which is where judges, years ago, said that the Constitution allowed slavery because of personal property rights.	1
ClaimBuster	8792				I would say the only way -- because those stories are all totally false, I have to say that.	0
ClaimBuster	8793				I don't believe we're going to go back to the Cold War.	0
ClaimBuster	8794				And that state we controlled spending.	1
ClaimBuster	8795				And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division.	1
ClaimBuster	8796				And I would say to the Soviet Union, we will sit and negotiate with you as long as it takes, to have not only legitimate arms limitation, but to have a reduction of these nuclear weapons to the point that neither one of us represents a threat to the other.	0
ClaimBuster	8797				I don't want to see the Federal Government licensing grandmothers.	0
ClaimBuster	8798				And only the US could do this.	0
ClaimBuster	8799				She said she thought nuclear weaponry - and the control of nuclear arms.	1
ClaimBuster	8800				82,000 Arizonians lost their health insurance under President Bush's watch.	1
ClaimBuster	8801				President Bush recently sent a senior ambassador, Bill Burns, to participate in talks with the Europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	8802				At the same time, regulation can become excessive.	0
ClaimBuster	8803				Sure we want family leave.	0
ClaimBuster	8804				He puts his money in the outyears, and even if he were re-elected, he'd be gone before anything would happen, and nothing is going to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	8805				Mr. President, if I heard you correctly, you said that these deficits don't have anything to do with interest rates.	1
ClaimBuster	8806				That's where he was breaking the agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	8807				Well, Mr. Ford doesn't seem to put into perspective the fact that when - when uh five hundred thousand more people are out of work than there were three months ago, while we have two and a half million more people out of work than were when he took office, that this touches human beings.	1
ClaimBuster	8808				So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	8809				And we've been in - on the whole, uninterested.	0
ClaimBuster	8810				They are now engaged in a debate over whether war is the means of Communizing the world or whether they should use subversion, infiltration, economic struggles and all the rest.	1
ClaimBuster	8811				... right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP.	1
ClaimBuster	8812				You bet I want to open up a small part of Alaska.	0
ClaimBuster	8813				I have a manufacturing jobs credit.	1
ClaimBuster	8814				Under my plan, if a school is failing, we work with the states to give them the authority and the resources to close down that school and reopen it right away with a new principal, a new faculty, a turn-around team of specialists who know what they're doing.	0
ClaimBuster	8815				And I think he made a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	8816				I believe that the free Iraq is in this nation's interests.	0
ClaimBuster	8817				It's about your family; it's about your business, and in this case it's about a firmer policy with Cuba.	0
ClaimBuster	8818				And we've gotten some real progress in the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	8819				This is a government that says younger workers can't possibly have their own assets.	0
ClaimBuster	8820				We cleaned up more brown fields than any other administration in my state's history, 450 of them.	1
ClaimBuster	8821				I don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent crime-ridden society in the industrialized world.	0
ClaimBuster	8822				But spending money without a strategic plan can oftentimes be wasted.	0
ClaimBuster	8823				I am going to stand by and use the moral persuasion of the US to get satisfaction in terms of prison camps, and we're making some progress there, and in terms of getting humanitarian relief in there.	1
ClaimBuster	8824				I notice that Governor Reagan recently mentioned the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	8825				Our hearts and -- and minds go out to them.	0
ClaimBuster	8826				So the choice for America is, you can have a plan that I've laid out in four points, each of which I can tell you more about or you can go to johnkerry.com and see more of it; or you have the president's plan, which is four words: more of the same.	0
ClaimBuster	8827				I wish you would have done this.	0
ClaimBuster	8828				And may God bless the US of America.	0
ClaimBuster	8829				You won't pay a fine, because...	0
ClaimBuster	8830				The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States?	0
ClaimBuster	8831				Who -- why would you want to increase anybody's taxes right now?	0
ClaimBuster	8832				Sometimes the United States has to act alone or at least has to act first.	0
ClaimBuster	8833				But I am not going to slam the door on women and children.	0
ClaimBuster	8834				Our water is cleaner now.	1
ClaimBuster	8835				I would rather not critique the 2 candidates.	0
ClaimBuster	8836				When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy.	0
ClaimBuster	8837				Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn't built.	0
ClaimBuster	8838				When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of.	1
ClaimBuster	8839				It's a lot more than $18 billion in pork-barrel spending.	1
ClaimBuster	8840				There is going to be the need for each and every one of us to start thinking about how we use energy.	0
ClaimBuster	8841				I came from very modest background.	1
ClaimBuster	8842				The World Bank I think is generally doing a better job, but I think one of the big issues here that doesn't get nearly enough attention is the issue of corruption.	0
ClaimBuster	8843				After all, it isn't paid for by my money, it isn't paid for by his, but by the people's money.	1
ClaimBuster	8844				People need to know that over the next ten years it is going to be $25 trillion of revenue that comes into our treasurey and we anticipate spending $21 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	8845				I want a great relationship with China.	0
ClaimBuster	8846				That's why I say again to all of you out there who have to deal with your household budgets and know how difficult it is that the next President has to do the same.	0
ClaimBuster	8847				The American people are moving again, and moving in the right direction.	0
ClaimBuster	8848				A little child before they're 18 months learns to think well of himself or herself or poorly.	1
ClaimBuster	8849				And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	8850				This is not the America that we've known in the past.	0
ClaimBuster	8851				Well, first of all, the president's figures of $2.2 trillion just aren't accurate.	1
ClaimBuster	8852				And now with this risky $550 billion tax scheme of Senator Dole's, even his own friends, his campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says that they can't possibly pay for it without cutting Medicare more and cutting Social Security as well, according to him.	1
ClaimBuster	8853				their Social Security tax payments by 50%.	1
ClaimBuster	8854				Now they have -- he has aligned with Russia and with Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	8855				I'm happy to have a longer conversation --	0
ClaimBuster	8856				And we -- we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	8857				And now we're going back to budgeting for additional lands for our parks.	0
ClaimBuster	8858				If we can get that across to the people of these countries, in this decade of the sixties, the struggle for freedom will be won.	0
ClaimBuster	8859				We have to change the culture of America.	0
ClaimBuster	8860				Take a look at upstate New York.	0
ClaimBuster	8861				We went from deficit to surplus.	1
ClaimBuster	8862				But it's locker room talk, and it's one of those things.	0
ClaimBuster	8863				But with regard to whether Mr. Mondale would be strong, as he said he would be, I know that he has a commercial out where he's appearing on the deck of the Nimitz and watching the F - 14's take off.	1
ClaimBuster	8864				And I don't assail him on that issue, or others on that issue.	0
ClaimBuster	8865				But let's look at it.	0
ClaimBuster	8866				The only thing consistent about my opponent's position is that he's been inconsistent.	0
ClaimBuster	8867				Could have a chance to serve as president.	0
ClaimBuster	8868				He's 10 years old now.	1
ClaimBuster	8869				Now let's just see what this means.	0
ClaimBuster	8870				I know what it's like to have your comrades reach out to you and your neighbors and your fellow citizens and pick you up and put you back in the fight.	0
ClaimBuster	8871				I'm not going to talk about a difference of character.	0
ClaimBuster	8872				That's something that all of us have to be involved with and that requires some leadership from Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	8873				You got a 265 billion dollar tax increase.	1
ClaimBuster	8874				My opponent says J. Danforth Quayle.	1
ClaimBuster	8875				And members of Senator Dole's own party in the Senate killed it.	1
ClaimBuster	8876				It's a $550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments, college loans, and small business loans.	1
ClaimBuster	8877				And secondly, we've had enough fighting.	1
ClaimBuster	8878				In '17, it implodes by itself.	1
ClaimBuster	8879				This economic package is about families but it's a six-point package.	1
ClaimBuster	8880				And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that they're setting up their training programs...	0
ClaimBuster	8881				We've got to have a - a firm way to handle the energy question.	0
ClaimBuster	8882				Well, let me just say that, with regard to that same missile system, I happen to support and believe in the missile, itself.	0
ClaimBuster	8883				And I don't want to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	8884				Just a fact clarification real quickly.	0
ClaimBuster	8885				This is one of your own advisers.	1
ClaimBuster	8886				It's time to bring folks together to say that all seniors will get prescription drug coverage.	0
ClaimBuster	8887				What we can do to help young women and women of all ages is to have a strong economy, so strong that employers that are looking to find good employees and bringing them into their workforce and adapting to a flexible work schedule that gives women opportunities that they would otherwise not be able to afford.	1
ClaimBuster	8888				We take program after program that we don't absolutely have to have, and we get rid of them.	0
ClaimBuster	8889				I do believe it's wrong to use a litmus test.	0
ClaimBuster	8890				I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say.	0
ClaimBuster	8891				Something that the vice president√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s running mate supports.	0
ClaimBuster	8892				I think good will on both parts, hard bargaining by both parties and a reasonable compromise will be in the best interests of all parties.	0
ClaimBuster	8893				I don't just talk about it.	0
ClaimBuster	8894				And I was embarrassed by it.	0
ClaimBuster	8895				We've uh - ignored or excluded the American people and the Congress from participation in the shaping of our foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	8896				And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	8897				And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has...	0
ClaimBuster	8898				Was -- Lorranna -- Lorraine -- we are a nation of immigrants.	0
ClaimBuster	8899				But we will have a very poor nation and a very unsound economy if we follow that path.	0
ClaimBuster	8900				We had a tire case in which they were flooding us with cheap domestic tires -- or -- or cheap Chinese tires.	1
ClaimBuster	8901				What I've also said is if we're going to go after folks who are here illegally, we should do it smartly and go after folks who are criminals, gang bangers, people who are hurting the community, not after students, not after folks who are here just because they're trying to figure out how to feed their families.	0
ClaimBuster	8902				I think it's going to be critically important for us to recruit a generation of new teachers, an army of new teachers, especially in math and science, give them higher pay, give them more professional development and support in exchange for higher standards and accountability.	0
ClaimBuster	8903				... reduce this -- I can -- we can do it with this kind of job creation of energy independence.	0
ClaimBuster	8904				You picked up a $500-billion bill because of the dumb way the federal government deregulated it.	1
ClaimBuster	8905				Because in industry today, we're producing more, over the last several years, and at 12% less use of energy than we were back in about 1973.	1
ClaimBuster	8906				Secondly, we've set up what's called the -- well, first of all, I agree with my opponent that the biggest threat facing this country is weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a terrorist network.	0
ClaimBuster	8907				I readily admit I'm not going to grow the size of the federal government like he is.	0
ClaimBuster	8908				Mr. Ford has shown an absence of leadership, and an absence of a grasp of what this country is and what it ought to be.	0
ClaimBuster	8909				And if we throw away that ability to serve as an honest broker, then we have thrown -- we will have thrown away a strategic asset that's important not only to us but also to Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	8910				So when I talk about how we're going to pay for education, how we're going to invest in infrastructure, how we're going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I've made it very clear we are going where the money is.	0
ClaimBuster	8911				We do need to make sure that they don't have arms that get into the -- the wrong hands.	0
ClaimBuster	8912				The electric decontrol bill that I fought for and signed in Texas has mandatory emission standards, Mr. Vice President.	1
ClaimBuster	8913				The present tax structure is a disgrace to this country; it's just a welfare program for the rich.	0
ClaimBuster	8914				I would never do anything that would increase the taxes for those who work for a living, or who are presently required to list all their income.	0
ClaimBuster	8915				These people are hurting in the inner cities.	0
ClaimBuster	8916				They had built covert facilities.	1
ClaimBuster	8917				Probably a lot of kids here disagree with me.	0
ClaimBuster	8918				Because if there's a two parent family, the prospect of living in poverty goes down dramatically.	1
ClaimBuster	8919				Do we remove dams that produce hydroelectric energy?	0
ClaimBuster	8920				On the 2nd debate, I offered, since both sides want the enterprise zones and we can't get together, I said I'll take a few days off and go to Washington and hold hands with you and we'll get it done.	1
ClaimBuster	8921				I vetoed a number of bills of that kind myself, when I was in California.	1
ClaimBuster	8922				I would appoint people that have a philosophy that I think would have it quite likely they would uphold Roe v. Wade.	0
ClaimBuster	8923				We can't simply stick our heads in the sands in terms of testing.	0
ClaimBuster	8924				It's going to help Jeremy get a job when he comes out of school.	0
ClaimBuster	8925				We've got chemical warfare being conducted against our children on the streets in this country all day every day, and we don't have the will to stamp it out.	0
ClaimBuster	8926				And you have to have cost controls, yes.	0
ClaimBuster	8927				Let her release the e-mails.	0
ClaimBuster	8928				I will have a unique mandate.	0
ClaimBuster	8929				If there's one thing Africa needs it's technical assistance.	0
ClaimBuster	8930				And I believe that if we can tap the tremendous untapped reservoir of innate strength in this country, that we can once again have a government as good as our people, and let the world know what we still know and hope for - that we still live in the greatest and the strongest and the best country on earth.	0
ClaimBuster	8931				And I think that the environmental benefits that come from sound management of the land ought to represent a new way for farmers to get some income that will enable them -- enable you to make sensible choices in crop rotation, and when you leave the land fallow and the rest.	0
ClaimBuster	8932				I'll give you one, that HMET, that heavy truck, that's cost what is it $850 million and the Pentagon didn't request it and, yet, a member of Congress, a very powerful one, put it in the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	8933				I don't believe I've used those words.	0
ClaimBuster	8934				That's where government should not be.	0
ClaimBuster	8935				First contact should be with the money when she's pregnant.	0
ClaimBuster	8936				We're going to do a lot of things for college tuition.	0
ClaimBuster	8937				I think it's a good decision--took a little heat for it, but I think it was the correct decision to do.	0
ClaimBuster	8938				I happened to favor the other piece of legislation and thought that it would be better for the senior citizens and provide better care than the one that was finally passed.	0
ClaimBuster	8939				Let's look at the reaction eh - reaction to Khrushchev and Eisenhower at the last U.N. session.	0
ClaimBuster	8940				It seems to me that a moment's reflection tells you why the United States Senate turned that amendment down, because it will undermine the practice of honest faith in our country by politicizing it.	0
ClaimBuster	8941				I opposed the grain embargo in my administration.	1
ClaimBuster	8942				I think you're right that the polls show that the majority of Hispanics want that bill, so I'm not doing it for political reasons.	1
ClaimBuster	8943				I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true.	0
ClaimBuster	8944				The President's favorite question is: Are you better off?	0
ClaimBuster	8945				I don't think we ought to be giving welfare payments to illegal immigrants.	0
ClaimBuster	8946				The fact is that he's cut job-training money.	1
ClaimBuster	8947				The tax burden on them has not gone down.	1
ClaimBuster	8948				We've created a mess, don't have much to show for it and we have got to fix it.	0
ClaimBuster	8949				(LAUGHTER) Just add up all the numbers.	0
ClaimBuster	8950				But, again, I want to return.	0
ClaimBuster	8951				As I said, we have made sure that millions of young people are able to get an education that they weren't able to get before.	1
ClaimBuster	8952				I have been a strong force for reform.	0
ClaimBuster	8953				Give me a chance to create these kind of jobs in America.	0
ClaimBuster	8954				That's what he's done when it comes to, for example, passing the landmark 1994 crime bill, the Violence Against Women's Act.	1
ClaimBuster	8955				the question, to sort of get a new military, get the best in the world, we got it, and they√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢re keeping the peace, and they're respected around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	8956				It was my very first bill, and I'm very proud of it because it symbolizes what I think we ought to be doing.	1
ClaimBuster	8957				We reduced the welfare rolls by 2 million already.	1
ClaimBuster	8958				The Natl Science Foundation did a study which said it would be difficult for us to reach fuel efficiency standards in excess of 37 miles per gallon by the year 2000.	1
ClaimBuster	8959				There are indications, because of new inventions, that ten, fifteen, or twenty nations will have a nuclear capacity - including Red China - by the end of the presidential office in 1964.	0
ClaimBuster	8960				We have to trust people to make decisions with their lives.	0
ClaimBuster	8961				Earmarks account for 0.5 percent of the total federal budget.	1
ClaimBuster	8962				Number one, I want to cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	8963				how well it could be done.	0
ClaimBuster	8964				Uhh - I believe also that uh - there is some merit to a - an amendment that uh - uh - Senator Everett Dirksen uh - proposed very frequently, an amendment that would uh - change the court decision as far as voluntary prayer in public schools.	0
ClaimBuster	8965				He is denigrating -- he's talking down our democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	8966				Well, the president's own CIA director says Saddam is stronger now than he was.	1
ClaimBuster	8967				We need to give the police a fighting chance in our urban areas where the gangs are building up.	0
ClaimBuster	8968				And uh - these projections have been very carefully made.	0
ClaimBuster	8969				I hope we can do it.	0
ClaimBuster	8970				He has learned the date of the expiration of SALT I, apparently.	1
ClaimBuster	8971				The big oil companies are against the measures to get more energy independence and renewable fuel.	1
ClaimBuster	8972				This is a town where the White House says, Congress did it; Congress says, the White House did it.	0
ClaimBuster	8973				The -- look, I think anybody out there can check the record.	0
ClaimBuster	8974				That of course was rejected as was the government contracts provision by the special session of the Congress to - in which Mr. Kennedy was quite active.	1
ClaimBuster	8975				Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	8976				I just don't believe that's the answer.	0
ClaimBuster	8977				They want these young people to have a chance to get jobs and the rest.	0
ClaimBuster	8978				That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.	1
ClaimBuster	8979				I'm going to ask the Congress for $2 billion to make sure we have the cleanest coal technologies in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	8980				"But what it does say is that ""insurers, you've got to take everybody."""	0
ClaimBuster	8981				We absolutely have to make more progress and that's why we're going to keep on pressing.	0
ClaimBuster	8982				And it's important, Jim, not only -- not just because of Texas, but because this mirrors the national controversy.	0
ClaimBuster	8983				I think we ought to do it by full enforcement of the catastrophic health insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	8984				But that progress is only the beginning.	0
ClaimBuster	8985				In the private sector, Governor Romney's company invested in what were called pioneers of outsourcing.	1
ClaimBuster	8986				Barry, I think a lot of this campaign, maybe over the last four years, has been devoted to this nation that I think government creates jobs, that that somehow is the answer.	0
ClaimBuster	8987				I think that the way to grow this economy is to keep taxes low, is have an energy plan, is to have litigation reform.	0
ClaimBuster	8988				When the action in Kosovo was dragging on and we were searching for a solution to the problem, our country had defeated the adversary on the battlefield without a single American life being lost in combat.	1
ClaimBuster	8989				That might be the explanation, if you tell me the program.	0
ClaimBuster	8990				I will let the American people decide that.	0
ClaimBuster	8991				My view is we want to find jobs and opportunities and education.	0
ClaimBuster	8992				We said you've got -- banks, you've got to raise your capital requirements.	1
ClaimBuster	8993				I said that our economic plan would produce eight million jobs, we have ten and a half million new jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	8994				We also need to provide an adequate supply of enriched uranium.	0
ClaimBuster	8995				Look at Lynn Martin, who's fighting against this glass ceiling and doing a first-class job on it.	1
ClaimBuster	8996				We came here loving this nation, serving it, and it has served all of our most bountiful dreams.	0
ClaimBuster	8997				I voted for border security in the United States Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	8998				In fact I said, is that the last jobs report before the election?	1
ClaimBuster	8999				We think that's very important because a lot of people take care of their parents.	1
ClaimBuster	9000				That has been reinforced by direct commitments of the president of the United States; it's been reinforced by a number of other nations under NATO.	1
ClaimBuster	9001				He didn't do any of those things.	0
ClaimBuster	9002				There's no doubt that we have achieved equal access to schools in America after a long and difficult and terrible struggle.	0
ClaimBuster	9003				Those are basic American values.	0
ClaimBuster	9004				This is an idea that's been around a long time, which is saying, hey, let's see if we can't get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality.	0
ClaimBuster	9005				Be strict and firm about it.	0
ClaimBuster	9006				Let's make sure that we're providing preventive care so we're catching the onset of something like diabetes.	0
ClaimBuster	9007				And she never will change.	0
ClaimBuster	9008				We're increasing the border security of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	9009				Here's the only problem: Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that you're getting from your employer.	1
ClaimBuster	9010				We have the most expensive health care system in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	9011				[Laughter] The fact of it is: The President's budget sought to cut Social Security by 25 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	9012				But that's only step one.	1
ClaimBuster	9013				And then, of course, the - the final thing is that I have signed and approved of more scenic rivers, more wilderness areas, since I've been president than any other president in the history of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	9014				I think human life is very, very precious.	0
ClaimBuster	9015				And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.	0
ClaimBuster	9016				I don't believe we should go to a summit conference unless we have such an agenda, unless we have some reasonable insur- assurance from Mr. Khrushchev that he intends seriously to negotiate on those points.	0
ClaimBuster	9017				Now, if you just want to get down to brass tacks, first thing you ought to do is get all these folks who've got these 1-way trade agreements that we've negotiated over the years and say fellas, we'll take the same deal we gave you.	1
ClaimBuster	9018				Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others.	1
ClaimBuster	9019				He had 16 other resolutions and nothing took place.	1
ClaimBuster	9020				They're from a fertility clinic.	1
ClaimBuster	9021				The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her.	0
ClaimBuster	9022				But I believe that this Agenda for American renewal I have is the answer to do it, and I believe we can get it done now, whereas we didn't in the past, because you're going to have a whole brand new bunch of people in the Congress that are going to have to listen to the same American people I'm listening to.	0
ClaimBuster	9023				General Shinsheki, the Army chief of staff, said you're going to need several hundred thousand troops.	1
ClaimBuster	9024				But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd- Frank, roll it back.	1
ClaimBuster	9025				But I want all the children -- I want these young people up here to be able to start with nothing but an idea like I did and build a business.	0
ClaimBuster	9026				They didn't volunteer the information.	1
ClaimBuster	9027				If you made 25,000 as the original proposal, you got your Social Security taxes increased.	1
ClaimBuster	9028				But as we look at the decisions that the next president of the United States is going to have to make, I just don't believe the place you go first is those programs, those so-called entitlements, which provide a basic floor of income and a modest amount of medical care for the elderly, the disabled, for people who can't make their way on their own, and in many cases, have given a great deal to this country.	0
ClaimBuster	9029				And it would be very difficult for me to answer that in any short period of time.	0
ClaimBuster	9030				If you're in your mid-40's under the governor's plan, Social Security will be bankrupt by the time you retire, if he takes it out of the Social Security Trust Fund.	1
ClaimBuster	9031				You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all.	1
ClaimBuster	9032				Let me say first of all, I'm all for students having more choices.	0
ClaimBuster	9033				He talks about middle-class tax cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	9034				People are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago, 2- 3rds of our people--a $1600 drop in average income in just the last 2 years.	1
ClaimBuster	9035				I hope we'll have a chance to get into that tonight, because I can get right to the center of the bull's-eye and tell you why we're losing whole industries in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	9036				But if you have a situation like that right in our backyard with chaos about to break out and flotillas forming to come across the water, and all kinds of violence there, right in one of our neighboring countries there, then I think that we did the right thing there.	0
ClaimBuster	9037				And they look at our country and they see what's going on.	0
ClaimBuster	9038				We had a great time.	0
ClaimBuster	9039				Number three, I'll make government more efficient and to cut back the number of employees, combine some agencies and departments.	0
ClaimBuster	9040				And what you're assuming is that that makes the recipient of the lobbying corrupt or the lobbyist himself corrupt.	0
ClaimBuster	9041				Now the next president of the United States in his first year is going to be confronted with a very serious question on our defense of Berlin, our commitment to Berlin.	0
ClaimBuster	9042				Appreciate the sacrifices their families make.	0
ClaimBuster	9043				One of the people who's here with me today met a woman in the airport saying her son, Jess was able to be present at the birth of her child because of the Family Leave Law.	1
ClaimBuster	9044				Number one, we've got to make sure that we've got oversight over this whole process; $700 billion, potentially, is a lot of money.	0
ClaimBuster	9045				I simply think it's wrong to take money away from programs that are helping build basic skills for kids, 90 percent of them are in the public schools; to take money away from programs that are helping fund the school lunch program, that are helping to fund the other programs, that are helping our schools to improve their standards.	1
ClaimBuster	9046				He spends more money for tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of his new spending proposals for health care, prescription drugs, education and national defense all combined.	1
ClaimBuster	9047				No, no, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.	0
ClaimBuster	9048				Where there are no failing schools, where the classrooms are small enough in size, number of students, so that the teacher can spend enough one-on-one time with each student.	0
ClaimBuster	9049				So these are the ways that you help families, you help youngsters to live better lives, and more decent lives.	0
ClaimBuster	9050				In partnership with the American Health Association...	0
ClaimBuster	9051				Why take it in the first place if you're going to give it back?	0
ClaimBuster	9052				If I think it's in our nation's strategic interest I'll commit troops.	0
ClaimBuster	9053				And one of the ways we're going to do it is, I'm going to work with my friend, John McCain, to further campaign finance reform so we get these incredible amounts of money out of the system and open it up to average people, so America is really represented by the people who make up America.	0
ClaimBuster	9054				You wonder, Nikki, why it is that people don't like us in some parts of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	9055				We are going to have to resort to van pooling, to car pooling.	0
ClaimBuster	9056				Will Guinea and Ghana, which have now voted with the Communists frequently as newly independent countries of Africa - will there be others?	1
ClaimBuster	9057				They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration.	1
ClaimBuster	9058				Now we're fighting again to get Mosul.	1
ClaimBuster	9059				In America no one will go without healthcare, no one will go without food.	0
ClaimBuster	9060				You know, I think his liberal vision is a thing of the past.	0
ClaimBuster	9061				And by that I want to have child care where the families, the parents, have control.	0
ClaimBuster	9062				On the other hand, women heads of household -- single women heads of household have -- for the first time there's been a turndown in the rate of poverty for them.	1
ClaimBuster	9063				We cut the cost - the increased cost of government - in half over the eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	9064				The economy is starting downhill with housing failure -- --	1
ClaimBuster	9065				"That's the extreme pro-abortion position, quote, ""health."""	0
ClaimBuster	9066				I have nothing but respect for the British, Tony Blair, and for what they've been willing to do.	0
ClaimBuster	9067				How can Barry Goldwater sitting in Arizona know whether I'm talking on the issues or not when we put out position paper after position paper, he puts out position paper after position paper; and we see this much about it, because everyone else is fascinated with polls and who's up or down today and who's going to be up or down tomorrow.	0
ClaimBuster	9068				We need to demand on results.	0
ClaimBuster	9069				It's like if you looked at the -- it's the equivalent of the buggy and horse days, compared to other industries here in America.	0
ClaimBuster	9070				Uh - Also, so that we can get the uh - opportunity for the questioners to question me, it will be before the next television debate.	0
ClaimBuster	9071				We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...	0
ClaimBuster	9072				It is a question of leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	9073				First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts.	0
ClaimBuster	9074				And it goes on and on.	0
ClaimBuster	9075				And that's one of the reasons why I believe I can get this job done, because I am determined for those soldiers and for those families, for those kids who put their lives on the line.	0
ClaimBuster	9076				The Byrd family may have a misunderstanding of it in Texas also.	0
ClaimBuster	9077				Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country, said, what's been the effect of Obamacare on your hiring plans?	1
ClaimBuster	9078				Do I think that I bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of our children still don't understand drugs are wrong, drugs can kill you.	0
ClaimBuster	9079				We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country.	1
ClaimBuster	9080				We must not be divided on this issue.	0
ClaimBuster	9081				Do you really think that 8 million Americans being out of work and the 50% unemployment among the youth of our country are acceptable?	1
ClaimBuster	9082				We have to have a streamlined NATO command structure.	0
ClaimBuster	9083				I have been for the taxpayer bill of rights all along.	1
ClaimBuster	9084				Because by far the vast majority of the help goes to people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.	1
ClaimBuster	9085				Our technicians have been working since that time in Geneva, trying to put into technical language a - an agreement that can be verified by both parties.	1
ClaimBuster	9086				It's what I look forward to doing and I know what it takes to make an economy work, and I know what a working economy looks like.	0
ClaimBuster	9087				Listen, the No Child Left Behind Act is really a jobs act when you think about it.	0
ClaimBuster	9088				I'm excited about our prospects as a nation.	0
ClaimBuster	9089				Obviously, we've poured billions of dollars into airport security.	1
ClaimBuster	9090				We're not going to spend billions on MX's on railroad cars, which is a weapons system we don't need, can't afford and won't help our defense posture at all.	1
ClaimBuster	9091				He didn't take that position on Budapest.	1
ClaimBuster	9092				The foreign policy of the United States meets the highest standards of morality.	0
ClaimBuster	9093				It will be determined to the extent that we represent the deepest ideals, the highest feelings and faith of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	9094				I have a long record of reform and fighting through on the floor of the United States Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	9095				You know, as governor, one of the things you have to deal with is catastrophe.	1
ClaimBuster	9096				We have a back-up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures.	1
ClaimBuster	9097				If they do give us a bona fide, complete uh - accounting of the eight hundred MIA's, then I believe that the United States should begin negotiations for the uh - admission of Vietnam to the United Nations.	0
ClaimBuster	9098				That's what I've tried to do and that's what I will continue to do as president.	0
ClaimBuster	9099				Third, I believe we should step up the use of our surplus foods in these areas until we're able to get the people back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	9100				In fact, it would be deflationary; it would cause great unemployment; it would cause a real slowdown in our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	9101				I think if you're going to have tax relief, everybody benefits.	0
ClaimBuster	9102				Candy, what Governor Romney said just isn't true.	0
ClaimBuster	9103				When I graduated from college, there were plenty of fancy ways to get out of going and being a part of that.	1
ClaimBuster	9104				We've got a good, common-sense policy.	0
ClaimBuster	9105				In any event, we saved the taxpayers $16 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	9106				And I wish Governor Bush would join me this evening in endorsing the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform Bill.	0
ClaimBuster	9107				There are seniors who pay more for their prescriptions than a lot of other people, more than their pets, sometimes.	1
ClaimBuster	9108				Small business is where jobs come from.	1
ClaimBuster	9109				In the last 21 months, more than 6 million people have gotten jobs -- there have been created new jobs for those people to where there are now 105 million civilians working, where there were only 99 million before; 107, if you count the military.	1
ClaimBuster	9110				Is it really the view of the American people, however you feel on the question of abortion, that government ought to be reaching into your livingrooms and making choices like this?	0
ClaimBuster	9111				I think the American people would appreciate that.	0
ClaimBuster	9112				The figures that the President has just used about California is a distortion of the situation there, because while I was Governor of California, our spending in California increased less per capita than the spending in Georgia while Mr. Carter was Governor of Georgia in the same four years.	1
ClaimBuster	9113				Now, here is how that connects with all the rest of what we've been talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	9114				We've increased money for ammunition and weapons and pay and homeland security.	1
ClaimBuster	9115				Under the governor's plan, if you kept the same fee for service that you have now under Medicare, your premiums would go up by between 18% and 47%, and that is the study of the Congressional plan that he's modeled his proposal on by the Medicare actuaries.	1
ClaimBuster	9116				But this administration time and time again has lost its way in this field.	0
ClaimBuster	9117				"And the answer is, ""Absolutely not."""	0
ClaimBuster	9118				The secretary already has the power to do that in the rescue package, but it hasn't been exercised yet.	1
ClaimBuster	9119				We needed to go to the U.N.	0
ClaimBuster	9120				We have to have modernization, especially if we achieve the 50 percent reduction in strategic weapons that our President is taking the leadership to attain.	1
ClaimBuster	9121				And that was before the war started.	1
ClaimBuster	9122				I have to pay the administration a compliment.	0
ClaimBuster	9123				But we have some work to do.	0
ClaimBuster	9124				That is the same old argument that's gotten us into trouble on the deficit side.	0
ClaimBuster	9125				So I think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force, and I will not, as president, in order to keep the American people safe.	0
ClaimBuster	9126				If we pull back in some isolation and say we don't have to do our share, or more than our share, anymore, I believe you are going to just ask for conflagration that we'll get involved in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	9127				Well, that's a great question.	0
ClaimBuster	9128				He says we have to move from one area of the world to another.	1
ClaimBuster	9129				So I hope that we can begin to move those resources.	0
ClaimBuster	9130				You know that home values of retirees continues to decline and people are no longer able to afford their mortgage payments.	1
ClaimBuster	9131				Now, how do we achieve it is the most critical component of it.	0
ClaimBuster	9132				Who's going -- the famous thing, we're going to answer our call at 3 o'clock in the morning.	0
ClaimBuster	9133				No, it was -- we put up the American flag.	1
ClaimBuster	9134				I'll make some news in the 3rd debate.	0
ClaimBuster	9135				We provided more money for daycare in the bill that passed the senate, was vetoed, then it came back and the president signed pretty much the same bill.	1
ClaimBuster	9136				I didn't win Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	9137				You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen.	1
ClaimBuster	9138				And so we're matching them up.	0
ClaimBuster	9139				I have fought to cut spending.	1
ClaimBuster	9140				Tom -- or John mentioned me being wildly liberal.	1
ClaimBuster	9141				And the American taxpayer ought to be glad they have a president to stand up to a spending Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	9142				Today it is up to about $38,000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	9143				The way we're going to create jobs here is not just to change our tax code, but also to double our exports.	0
ClaimBuster	9144				She had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go.	0
ClaimBuster	9145				I think that Senator Kennedy's policies and recommendations for the handling of the Castro regime are probably the most dangers- dangerously irresponsible recommendations that he's made during the course of this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	9146				And he has my full confidence and he'll have the confidence of people that are in their 30√É¬è√¢‚Äö¬¨s and 40√É¬è√¢‚Äö¬¨s and more.	0
ClaimBuster	9147				But this law can be used as leverage to get other countries to help us to move Cuba to democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	9148				So, there can be no concessions under any circumstances, because if we do it's an open invitation to others to do the same.	0
ClaimBuster	9149				I headed the task force when I was a member of the Congress way back in the late '60s on these kinds of things, on the Republican side.	1
ClaimBuster	9150				When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it's one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports.	1
ClaimBuster	9151				I don't believe it is fair to slap a 50-cent-a-gallon tax over whatever many years on the people that have to drive for a living, people that go long distances.	0
ClaimBuster	9152				So that is my answer to this question.	0
ClaimBuster	9153				And we just have a big disagreement about this.	0
ClaimBuster	9154				That's why I want another 4 years.	0
ClaimBuster	9155				You can decide which of us you think are right.	0
ClaimBuster	9156				It wasn't thought through properly.	0
ClaimBuster	9157				But here you cut the drug czar's office 83 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	9158				It would have eliminated the AmeriCorps plan and it would have cut back on student loans and scholarships.	1
ClaimBuster	9159				I agree with that, and that's why I was a principal sponsor of a liberal adoption law, so that more of these children could come to term, so that the young mothers were educated, so we found an option, an alternative.	1
ClaimBuster	9160				There are whole or this area there are whole blocks of land that are left bare, just bulldozed down flat.	1
ClaimBuster	9161				And -- as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released.	0
ClaimBuster	9162				We're going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s.	0
ClaimBuster	9163				No, it can become out of date.	0
ClaimBuster	9164				Those things deserve to be dealt with from day one.	0
ClaimBuster	9165				I would have brought our allies to our side.	0
ClaimBuster	9166				I believe we can all work together to make the individuals in the future have more and all of us working together can build a better America.	0
ClaimBuster	9167				But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma.	0
ClaimBuster	9168				That's why I'm going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history.	0
ClaimBuster	9169				I have opposed the president on spending, on climate change, on torture of prisoner, on - on Guantanamo Bay.	1
ClaimBuster	9170				Now in the case of Mr. Nixon, the reason the - the pardon was given, was that, when I took office this country was in a very, very divided condition.	1
ClaimBuster	9171				I met a lady in Colorado Springs about seven weeks ago now.	1
ClaimBuster	9172				Why pursue a strategy that would delegate to computers the question of starting a war?	0
ClaimBuster	9173				I have got a comprehensive strategy to not only chase down the Al Qaida, wherever it exists -- and we're making progress; three-quarters of Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justice -- but to make sure that countries that harbor terrorists are held to account.	1
ClaimBuster	9174				I grew up in the segregated South, thankfully raised by a grandfather with almost no formal education but with a heart of gold who taught me early that all people were equal in the eyes of God.	1
ClaimBuster	9175				And I respect the Second Amendment and I will not tamper with the Second Amendment.	1
ClaimBuster	9176				But that's the time when you're tested not only -- it's the time to test your mettle, a time to test your heart when you see people whose lives have been turned upside down.	0
ClaimBuster	9177				The first lady has done great work with an organization called Joining Forces putting our veterans back to work.	1
ClaimBuster	9178				We've got to do that in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	9179				These are sophisticated people watching tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	9180				And we're beginning with drug education and prevention beginning in the early elementary grades in every elementary school in our state, and that's the kind of effort we need in every elementary school in the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	9181				You will find that some of the worst school systems in America get the most money per student.	1
ClaimBuster	9182				You've got to understand that it is only the United States that can stand for freedom and democracy around the world and we can't turn it over to the United Nations or other multilateral organizations.	0
ClaimBuster	9183				I was going to say something...	0
ClaimBuster	9184				The amount of money that has to be raised in taxes for middle-class families to make up for completely eliminating that on the very wealthiest, the billionaires, that would be an extra heavy burden on middle-class families.	0
ClaimBuster	9185				I don't think any of us can say that our standing in the world now, the way children around the world look at the United States, is the same.	0
ClaimBuster	9186				Our people feel that we've lost something precious.	0
ClaimBuster	9187				That would break the auto industry and throw a lot of people out of work.	0
ClaimBuster	9188				And she always will be.	0
ClaimBuster	9189				I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted.	1
ClaimBuster	9190				They gave it a great deal of conscience and a great deal of work.	0
ClaimBuster	9191				When I was in the United States Senate I worked with former President Bush, your father.	1
ClaimBuster	9192				They're against the American way.	0
ClaimBuster	9193				I will accept and have accepted the recommendations of 2 proven leaders, General Colin Powell and Secretary Dick Cheney.	1
ClaimBuster	9194				And it's a strain on your family budget, but it's also bad for our national security, because countries like Russia and Venezuela and, you know, in some cases, countries like Iran, are benefiting from higher oil prices.	1
ClaimBuster	9195				That's how you gain legitimacy with your own countrypeople, and that's how you gain legitimacy in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	9196				Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground.	1
ClaimBuster	9197				So one more effort should be made.	0
ClaimBuster	9198				I propose more than twice as much because I think it's needed.	0
ClaimBuster	9199				When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it's in business and trade, where we're doing so badly.	1
ClaimBuster	9200				And that's how we're going to be more competitive, by making sure our kids are graduating from school and college.	0
ClaimBuster	9201				And I know how hard it is for that -- for an Army and a military to recover from that.	0
ClaimBuster	9202				It was not a spontaneous demonstration, is that what you're saying?	0
ClaimBuster	9203				The question before you comes down to this: Do you want to see America return to the policies of weakness of the last 4 years?	0
ClaimBuster	9204				Senator Dole just said we had the worst economy in the century.	1
ClaimBuster	9205				And I don't have any foreign money in my campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	9206				I think we've never had a situation so bad in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	9207				You just know you're reading a good judicial decision.	0
ClaimBuster	9208				And businesses did very well.	0
ClaimBuster	9209				And I'll bring new competition to bring the price down.	0
ClaimBuster	9210				While I was governor of Georgia, although I'm not a lawyer, we had complete reform of the Georgia court system.	1
ClaimBuster	9211				That is just a downpayment, in my opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	9212				That's because we believe in investing in education and in jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	9213				We've got to lead the world now to crack down on proliferation as a whole.	0
ClaimBuster	9214				So we have -- as we said, if you want to keep doing business and selling your products over here, you're going to have to quit pirating our CDs, and they agreed to do things and verify that they had done it, which will make the problem much better.	1
ClaimBuster	9215				That would be a time to seriously consider the use of force.	0
ClaimBuster	9216				The revenues exceed the expenses in Social Security until the year 2015 which means all retirees are going to get the promises made.	1
ClaimBuster	9217				And the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	9218				There are two distinguished authors on arms control in this country -- there are many others, but two that I want to cite tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	9219				So I talk about the corrupt media.	0
ClaimBuster	9220				And we're going to keep it out of the hands of terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	9221				It means making more progress in civil rights than we have so that we can be a splendid example for all the world to see - a democracy in action at its best.	0
ClaimBuster	9222				Just think in your own business, if you had all of your long term problems financed short term.	0
ClaimBuster	9223				So we're going to get a special prosecutor, and we're going to look into it, because you know what?	0
ClaimBuster	9224				I mean, that's been done.	1
ClaimBuster	9225				I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership.	0
ClaimBuster	9226				You put your thumb on a button and somebody blows up 20 minutes later.	0
ClaimBuster	9227				Where, then, do we disagree?	0
ClaimBuster	9228				That's why I'm such a strong believer in medical liability reform.	0
ClaimBuster	9229				And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	9230				Even in Iran they have had an election that began to bring about some change.	1
ClaimBuster	9231				Let's put it in perspective.	0
ClaimBuster	9232				And that law has died in committee also because of the same kind of opposition.	1
ClaimBuster	9233				I just described the coalition.	1
ClaimBuster	9234				Also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them.	0
ClaimBuster	9235				I served as governor and showed I could get them done.	1
ClaimBuster	9236				And people -- not everybody agrees with some of the decisions I've made.	0
ClaimBuster	9237				They had a cease-fire three weeks ago.	1
ClaimBuster	9238				We have freed other nations from dictators.	1
ClaimBuster	9239				I've met with a lot of them, and I've heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that's what I want to see.	1
ClaimBuster	9240				And it's not just because I worked with George W. Bush after 9/11, and I was very proud that when I told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said you've got it, and he never wavered.	1
ClaimBuster	9241				You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures.	1
ClaimBuster	9242				We live in a global economy, not a national economy.	0
ClaimBuster	9243				The Duelfer report confirmed that decision today, because what Saddam Hussein was doing was trying to get rid of sanctions so he could reconstitute a weapons program.	1
ClaimBuster	9244				North Korea quadrupled its nuclear capability.	1
ClaimBuster	9245				And I've made it very plain to them, we seek no superiority.	0
ClaimBuster	9246				I think the US has to still have the Statue of Liberty as a symbol, caring for others.	0
ClaimBuster	9247				They have stationed additional troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.	1
ClaimBuster	9248				The uh - right of indigent or very poor accused persons to uh - legal counsel.	0
ClaimBuster	9249				I also think we should have frankly restrictions on assault weapons whose only purpose is to kill.	0
ClaimBuster	9250				I have fought against it my career.	1
ClaimBuster	9251				But with regard to these high interest rates, too, at least give us the recognition of the fact that when you left office, Mr. Mondale, they were 211/2 -- the prime rate.	1
ClaimBuster	9252				But I do believe that with my record in Congress, having led the new Congressmen to a code of ethics through major main emphasis on it in full disclosure, that I've got a good record.	0
ClaimBuster	9253				But for us to be able to promote those principles of peace requires us to be strong.	0
ClaimBuster	9254				I believe on the record that this administration has been more responsive and we have carried out the law to the letter, and I'm proud of the record.	0
ClaimBuster	9255				During the years between World War I and World War II, a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	9256				Number one, we have an agreement where they notify us and we notify them of any uh - military maneuvers that are to be be undertaken.	1
ClaimBuster	9257				We'll continue to build strong coalitions.	0
ClaimBuster	9258				General Twining said they were still doing it in 1959.	1
ClaimBuster	9259				I'll be very proud to.	0
ClaimBuster	9260				They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration.	1
ClaimBuster	9261				The problem is we still have a archaic, 20th-century regulatory system for 21st-century financial markets.	1
ClaimBuster	9262				And what I want to do, is build on the five million jobs that we've created over the last 30 months in the private sector alone.	1
ClaimBuster	9263				When Mr. Nixon made his famous uh speech on Operation Independence we were importing about 35 percent of our oil.	1
ClaimBuster	9264				We've gotten the Americans for Disabilities Act, which I think is one of the foremost pieces of civil rights legislation.	0
ClaimBuster	9265				There√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s a long line of McCains that have served our country for a long time in war and in peace, it's been the great honor of my life, and I've been proud to serve.	1
ClaimBuster	9266				That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	9267				And likewise you've got more and more debt on your back.	0
ClaimBuster	9268				We won a majority, we didn't win the two-thirds that was necessary nor to pass that resolution, George.	1
ClaimBuster	9269				There are a good many able men who could be secretary of state.	0
ClaimBuster	9270				And, as a consequence, his consistent pattern throughout his career is to fight for the little guy.	0
ClaimBuster	9271				Now, the difference in our plans is I want that $2,000 to go to you, and the vice president would like to be spending the $2,000 on your behalf.	1
ClaimBuster	9272				So we have to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	9273				And the reason I've had to do that is that he ran on the left in the Democratic primary, ran firmly and ran with conviction and ran on his record.	1
ClaimBuster	9274				The president hasn't balanced a budget yet.	1
ClaimBuster	9275				Mr. Bush said once again I was going to have $150 billion tax increase.	1
ClaimBuster	9276				And I -- and I honestly don't believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas, including his initial reaction to Russian invasion -- aggression in Georgia, to his -- you know, we've seen this stubbornness before in this administration to cling to a belief that somehow the surge has not succeeded and failing to acknowledge that he was wrong about the surge is -- shows to me that we -- that -- that we need more flexibility in a president of the United States than that.	0
ClaimBuster	9277				So I don't intend to see it undone.	0
ClaimBuster	9278				"I decided I was dumb and didn't understand it so I called a ""Who's Who"" of the folks that have been around it, and I said why won't everybody go south; they said it will be disruptive; I said for how long."	0
ClaimBuster	9279				I want us to invest in you.	0
ClaimBuster	9280				NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	9281				So, for the viewers who are watching, I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan.	0
ClaimBuster	9282				They can't pay for their prescription drugs and so they're some of the ones that go to Canada regularly in order to get their prescription drugs.	1
ClaimBuster	9283				And what is important is making sure that we disagree without being disagreeable.	0
ClaimBuster	9284				That is the kind of thing we have to do, give people like you and our families the power to give those values to our children.	0
ClaimBuster	9285				And let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down, because as a chief executive that's balanced ten budgets in a row, I've had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices.	1
ClaimBuster	9286				They said, let us win.	1
ClaimBuster	9287				Pretty simple, folks -- if you're paying more and you don't have the best, if all else fails go copy the people who have the best who spend less, right?	0
ClaimBuster	9288				Tell me how it's affected you again.	0
ClaimBuster	9289				Neither of them have health insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	9290				I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania.	1
ClaimBuster	9291				And I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she's being who she was, she's being who she was born as.	1
ClaimBuster	9292				And if we could run our country the way I've run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of.	0
ClaimBuster	9293				This is an historic time.	0
ClaimBuster	9294				As I said before, Jim, there are going to be things that end up having to be ...	0
ClaimBuster	9295				We don't need a constitutional amendment for kids to pray, and what I did was to have the justice department and the education department for the first time ever issue a set of guidelines that we gave to every school in America, saying that children could not be interfered with in religious advocacy when they were praying, when they were doing whatever they could do under the constitution, just because they were on a public school ground, and I think anyone who's experienced this will tell you that our administration has done more than any in years to clarify the freedom of religion in the public square, including in the public schools.	1
ClaimBuster	9296				They talk, they don't get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	9297				In other words, I believe that doctors should not be able to be kicked out of managed care plans just because they tell the patients what they need and what more expensive care options might be.	0
ClaimBuster	9298				I think it needs to be moved out of the budget and protected.	0
ClaimBuster	9299				What I want to do is to send flexibility and authority to the local folks so you can choose what to do with the money.	0
ClaimBuster	9300				We'll honor our commitment to our seniors.	0
ClaimBuster	9301				It's been there for 20 years.	1
ClaimBuster	9302				It is a plan that will have 200 new programs -- expanded programs and creates 20,000 new bureaucrats.	1
ClaimBuster	9303				You bet we want to allow younger workers to take some of their own money.	0
ClaimBuster	9304				He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree.	0
ClaimBuster	9305				I oppose it because I want us to have more oil exploration and not less.	0
ClaimBuster	9306				Senator, no one's playing with your votes.	0
ClaimBuster	9307				Aren't you sick of being treated like an unprogrammed robot?	0
ClaimBuster	9308				It sort of brought home the transition to democracy that Russia was trying to make.	0
ClaimBuster	9309				Now, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication.	1
ClaimBuster	9310				We don't have a person to waste in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	9311				I don't believe that -- did we hear the size of the fine?	0
ClaimBuster	9312				Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system.	0
ClaimBuster	9313				I'm not sure what kind of view he's describing to me.	0
ClaimBuster	9314				Now, Senator McCain and I do agree, this is the greatest nation on earth.	0
ClaimBuster	9315				So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health.	0
ClaimBuster	9316				Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave.	0
ClaimBuster	9317				We're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism.	1
ClaimBuster	9318				But there's one last ingredient that I just want to mention, and that's parents.	0
ClaimBuster	9319				The embryo had already been destroyed prior to my decision.	1
ClaimBuster	9320				Well, could I just finish -- I think I...	0
ClaimBuster	9321				A lot of initials from a guy who's not from Washington, isn't it?	0
ClaimBuster	9322				And the compounding rate of interest effect will make it more likely that the Social Security system is solvent for our children and our grandchildren.	0
ClaimBuster	9323				And Prime Minister Koizumi is going to call countries to account, to get them to contribute.	0
ClaimBuster	9324				I'd go crazy sitting up there slow dancing that one.	0
ClaimBuster	9325				I appreciate his efforts and I wish him well.	0
ClaimBuster	9326				... and reduce our violence.	0
ClaimBuster	9327				We've done that by executive order.	1
ClaimBuster	9328				But your rate comes down and the burden also comes down on you for one more reason, and that is every middle-income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends or capital gains.	1
ClaimBuster	9329				So I think the appeal is yes, we care.	0
ClaimBuster	9330				But if everyone here in this audience was dead on in the middle of the middle-class, then the tax cuts for every single one of you all added up would be less than the tax cut his plan would give to just one member of that top wealthiest 1%.	1
ClaimBuster	9331				And you don't care about anything but making money.	0
ClaimBuster	9332				Mine is I want to empower people in their own lives.	0
ClaimBuster	9333				Well, first of all, Bob, thank you for moderating tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	9334				But let me -- let me come back -- we can come back.	0
ClaimBuster	9335				I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here even though sometime back they may have entered illegally.	0
ClaimBuster	9336				I think we're going to have to work to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	9337				And that's why I think it's important for the president to set a tone that says all of us are going to contribute, all of us are going to make sacrifices, and it means that, yes, we may have to cut some spending, although I disagree with Senator McCain about an across-the- board freeze.	0
ClaimBuster	9338				Well, let me just correct something very quickly.	0
ClaimBuster	9339				You don't tell countries you're going to unilaterally renegotiate agreements with them.	0
ClaimBuster	9340				You get a plan that will include prescription drugs, a plan that will give you options.	0
ClaimBuster	9341				One percent of America got $89 billion last year in a tax cut, but people working hard, playing by the rules, trying to take care of their kids, family values, that we're supposed to value so much in America -- I'm tired of politicians who talk about family values and don't value families.	1
ClaimBuster	9342				The difference is I want to bring it to 100% and he wants to bring it to 5%.	0
ClaimBuster	9343				And you pull all of it at once and read it and I did, and it's pretty clear what she and Kelly and the other key guys around that thing thought they were doing.	0
ClaimBuster	9344				And China's a got a lot of influence over North Korea, some ways more than we do.	1
ClaimBuster	9345				It presents a threat not only to our friends but ultimately a threat to us to have Iran have nuclear material, nuclear weapons that could be used against us or used to be threatening to us.	0
ClaimBuster	9346				Another very important - uh aspect of our - uh economy would be to increase production in every way possible, uh to hold down - uh taxes on individuals, and to uh shift the tax burdens onto those who have avoided paying taxes in the past.	0
ClaimBuster	9347				It was a horrible situation, no one liked to see it on our TV screens, but it's a case where we need to make sure we have an early warning system in place in places where there could be ethnic cleansing and genocide the way we saw it there in Rwanda.	1
ClaimBuster	9348				I would make sure that key members of Congress were called in to discuss the gravity of the situation.	0
ClaimBuster	9349				The three priorities were health...	0
ClaimBuster	9350				People who want to build on their dreams and make sure their kids have an even bigger dreams than they have.	0
ClaimBuster	9351				Under President Bush, the middle class has seen their tax burden go up and the wealthiest's tax burden has gone down.	1
ClaimBuster	9352				They're coming here to work.	0
ClaimBuster	9353				This man has outspent me and the special interests are outspending me.	1
ClaimBuster	9354				At one of the recent economic summit conferences between myself and the other leaders of the western world, we committed ourselves to take strong action against terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	9355				There may be testing in outer space.	0
ClaimBuster	9356				As a matter of fact, uh - 25 percent of the total tax deductions, go for only 1 percent of the richest people in this country, and over 50 percent of the tax uh credits go for the 14 percent of the richest people in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	9357				I also would like to point out that Republican presidents in those years, faced with a Democratic majority in both houses of the Congress, found that their requests for defense budgets were very often cut.	1
ClaimBuster	9358				And our military, we've got to strengthen our military long-term.	0
ClaimBuster	9359				There is a crime bill which would put more police on the street, which was killed for this session by a filibuster in the Senate, mostly be Republican senators, and I think it's a shame it didn't pass, I think it should be made the law -- but it had the Brady bill in it, the waiting period.	1
ClaimBuster	9360				And the only way to do it is to pass strong legislation so that once apprehended, indicted, convicted, they'll be in jail and off the streets and not using guns in the commission of a crime.	0
ClaimBuster	9361				To stand up straight and not scowl.	0
ClaimBuster	9362				I don't think that is in our interest, and I don't think that would be smart to do.	0
ClaimBuster	9363				We've got to create the products of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	9364				You can't tell me that any one who uses beans instead of meat in the United States - and there are twenty-five million of them according to Mr. Benson - is well fed or adequately fed.	1
ClaimBuster	9365				Now I'm very surprised that Senator Kennedy, who is on the Foreign Relations Committee, would have made such a statement as this kind.	0
ClaimBuster	9366				I think you've got to look at how one has handled responsibility in office.	0
ClaimBuster	9367				I believe strongly we should do so in Berlin.	0
ClaimBuster	9368				Bernard, this was the first presidential decision that we as nominees were called upon to make.	1
ClaimBuster	9369				He hasn't even made a proposal on either one.	1
ClaimBuster	9370				25th of December, Mr. Vice President.	0
ClaimBuster	9371				Now, Mr. Herter in 1958, when he was Under Secretary of State, said they were strategically undefensible.	1
ClaimBuster	9372				She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code.	1
ClaimBuster	9373				Now that's up to 40%.	1
ClaimBuster	9374				I would never normalize relationships with Vietnam, nor permit them to join the United Nations until they've taken this action.	0
ClaimBuster	9375				He wants your kids to pay for it.	0
ClaimBuster	9376				The program that was put forward this summer, after we broke off the sugar quota with Cuba, really was done because we wanted to get through the O.A.S.	1
ClaimBuster	9377				The banking system in this country is fundamentally sound with some weak banks.	1
ClaimBuster	9378				It would be rather difficult to cover them in eight and- in two and a half minutes.	0
ClaimBuster	9379				Since the depths of the recession, we have added four million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	9380				The horse is up here now.	1
ClaimBuster	9381				Let me just tell you...	0
ClaimBuster	9382				But -- but the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case.	0
ClaimBuster	9383				Our Guard and reserves have been turned into almost active duty.	1
ClaimBuster	9384				So we have to be intelligent in the way we go about it.	0
ClaimBuster	9385				It's not the right thing to do.	0
ClaimBuster	9386				That, I don't think, is the kind of change that we need.	0
ClaimBuster	9387				You'll have a shot at me in 4 years and you can vote me right out if you think I've done a lousy job and I would welcome you to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	9388				We are going to make America strong again, and we are going to make America great again, and it has to start now.	0
ClaimBuster	9389				We've had free and fair elections.	1
ClaimBuster	9390				It is not and I just described it...	0
ClaimBuster	9391				We've now reduced the importing of foreign oil in the last year alone by one-third.	1
ClaimBuster	9392				But that doesn't mean it wasn't a mistake of judgment to go there and take the focus off of Osama bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	9393				But the fact is, America is the greatest force for good in the history of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	9394				You know, he started off with his dad as a millionaire...	1
ClaimBuster	9395				I can't handle that in a minute, but I hope we can get back into it later.	0
ClaimBuster	9396				It underscores what I had to say in the Hartford debate, that there is really no foreign policy in this administration.	0
ClaimBuster	9397				But I think we're all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools.	0
ClaimBuster	9398				First of all, I'd like to thank the League of Women Voters for making this debate possible.	0
ClaimBuster	9399				possibility for oil of the continental shelf around the United States; when you stop to think that the government has taken over 100 million acres of land out of circulation in Alaska, alone, that is believed by geologists to contain much in the line of minerals and energy sources, then I think it is the Government, and the Government with its own restrictions and regulations, that is creating the energy crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	9400				What I want to find, if I am privileged to have the opportunity to do it -- and the Supreme Court of the United States is at stake in this race, ladies and gentlemen.	0
ClaimBuster	9401				No, there wasn't check out a sex tape.	1
ClaimBuster	9402				It gives you the choice.	0
ClaimBuster	9403				And the decisions we make will have enormous practical consequences.	0
ClaimBuster	9404				I want to help young people have an education, just as I had an education after World War II with the GI bill of Rights.	1
ClaimBuster	9405				Where our natural resources development - which I also support, incidentally, however - whenever you uh - uh - in - in - uh - appropriates money for one of these projects, you have to pay now and appropriate the money and the eh- while they eventually do pay out, it doesn't mean that you - the government doesn't have to put out the money this year.	0
ClaimBuster	9406				We need a president who can go in - who derives his strength from the people.	0
ClaimBuster	9407				The Freedom Support Act is something I got through the Congress, and it's a very good thing, because it does exactly what you say, and I think you agree with that, to help Russian democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	9408				I'm opposed to that, too.	0
ClaimBuster	9409				And I ask you for the privilege of leading our nation to be stronger at home and respected again in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	9410				It has a population less than Chicago or Los Angeles, about the size of Dallas and Forth Worth combined.	1
ClaimBuster	9411				We collect 35 cents, and we don't have it to spend.	1
ClaimBuster	9412				This is a mischaracterization of my position.	0
ClaimBuster	9413				I have proposed a managed competition plan for health care.	1
ClaimBuster	9414				The president can't order Congress around.	0
ClaimBuster	9415				This is uh - something, though, that I think uh - is indicative of the need among the American people to know how its commander-in-chief, the president, feels and - and - and I think the only criticism that I would have uh - on - of Mr. Ford is that uh - immediately when the statement was re - re - revealed, uh - perhaps a - a statement from the president would have been a clarifying and a very beneficial thing.	0
ClaimBuster	9416				And I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you've never seen.	1
ClaimBuster	9417				We've stopped that practice now by measuring early.	1
ClaimBuster	9418				Now, let's balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	9419				Now, I want to build on that.	0
ClaimBuster	9420				There are 357, 000 good jobs -- manufacturing jobs, which are lost.	1
ClaimBuster	9421				He doesn't adequately fund it.	0
ClaimBuster	9422				Nor was I misleading on the day that the president decided to go to war when I said that he had made a mistake in not building strong alliances and that I would have preferred that he did more diplomacy.	1
ClaimBuster	9423				You've said publicly that it's now three times the rate of inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	9424				And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy.	0
ClaimBuster	9425				I'll talk about that a little bit later, but the changes are mind-boggling for world peace.	0
ClaimBuster	9426				I want to make sure our timekeepers are working here.	0
ClaimBuster	9427				And I had 5 small children, and my family and I decided we would stay the course, and we lived with that problem for 3 years.	1
ClaimBuster	9428				I think that this is uh - an instance of uh - deliberate distortion, and this has occurred also in the question about defense.	0
ClaimBuster	9429				I'll sit down with them, Democrats and Republicans alike, and work for my agenda for American renewal, which represents real change.	0
ClaimBuster	9430				I haven't given lots of thought to NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	9431				They know it better than anybody.	0
ClaimBuster	9432				But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.	0
ClaimBuster	9433				All right, the war's over; we know he's dropping mustard gas on his own people, we know he's threatened to incinerate half of Israel.	1
ClaimBuster	9434				We find four times as many projects undertaken and completed in this Administration than in the previous one.	1
ClaimBuster	9435				Governor Romney, you did not...	0
ClaimBuster	9436				So we have put all chips in, right there, and nobody is talking about losing this war.	1
ClaimBuster	9437				I've been speaking out since day 1.	1
ClaimBuster	9438				I agree, we shouldn't have quotas.	0
ClaimBuster	9439				Why wouldn't we want to eliminate that?	0
ClaimBuster	9440				And, number three, we've got to deal with education so that our young people are competitive in a global economy.	0
ClaimBuster	9441				Some of the hardest moments since I've been the governor of the State of Texas is to deal with those cases.	0
ClaimBuster	9442				They just passed an electoral...	1
ClaimBuster	9443				And when Iraq if free, America will be more secure.	0
ClaimBuster	9444				The kids of those that came here illegally, those kids, I think, should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the United States and military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident.	0
ClaimBuster	9445				That is just factually incorrect.	1
ClaimBuster	9446				... if you'll let me, Bob, just about education...	0
ClaimBuster	9447				Here's the record: We cut deficit four years in a row for the first time before the Civil War -- I mean, before World War II, and maybe before the Civil War, too.	1
ClaimBuster	9448				Now, it is a sin if you're taking a human life.	0
ClaimBuster	9449				And we've had great success at revenue enforcement.	0
ClaimBuster	9450				And Donald never tells you what he would do.	0
ClaimBuster	9451				You don't even know who the rebels are.	0
ClaimBuster	9452				First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is.	0
ClaimBuster	9453				There is nothing more prejudiced than not educating a child.	0
ClaimBuster	9454				And as for this idea of nation building, the phrase sounds grandiose.	0
ClaimBuster	9455				Therein is the best answer to her.	0
ClaimBuster	9456				I think you'll find the difference reflected in our budgets.	0
ClaimBuster	9457				That's what elections are all about.	0
ClaimBuster	9458				If we cannot succeed, then we must strengthen ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	9459				And I agree with a lot of the other things that the governor has said.	0
ClaimBuster	9460				I want to make America great again.	0
ClaimBuster	9461				I mentioned 31/2 million women, more now in poverty than four years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	9462				We have, as I said, cut the taxes, but we have reduced inflation, and for 2 years now it has stayed down there, not at double digit, but in the range of 4 or below.	1
ClaimBuster	9463				Those are the questions we need answered.	0
ClaimBuster	9464				So I reject the idea that I don't believe in great teachers or more teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	9465				I believe that your health care is just as important as any politician in Washington, D. C.	0
ClaimBuster	9466				It would change the basic tone and commitment that our nation has experienced ever since the Second World War, with al Presidents, Democratic and Republican.	0
ClaimBuster	9467				Well, actually it's -- it's -- it's a lengthy description.	1
ClaimBuster	9468				I noticed that Governor Reagan said that when he was a young man that there was no knowledge of a racial problem in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	9469				This is the kind of change that would be made.	0
ClaimBuster	9470				His opponent, Kostunica, has won the election.	1
ClaimBuster	9471				And, you know, one of the biggest problems we have with China is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets.	1
ClaimBuster	9472				Ah, well, now you've added a hypothetical there at the end, Mr. Kalb, about where we would send troops in to fight.	0
ClaimBuster	9473				It's very hard to get other countries to give up their weapons when you're busy developing a new one.	0
ClaimBuster	9474				He pushed them away time and again, pushed them away at the U.N., pushed them away individually.	1
ClaimBuster	9475				Number 3, on the pension funds, I don't know as much about it, but I will say this.	0
ClaimBuster	9476				So this is, that's a good start.	0
ClaimBuster	9477				And I believe our troops need other allies helping.	0
ClaimBuster	9478				He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan.	1
ClaimBuster	9479				There's never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.	0
ClaimBuster	9480				Everybody would have been forced into managed care.	0
ClaimBuster	9481				If we raise the minimum wage, which I will do over several years to $7 an hour, 9.2 million women who are trying to raise their families would earn another $3,800 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	9482				Now, you asked what mistakes.	0
ClaimBuster	9483				It doesn't seem to me that it's needed or necessary to have legislation in this particular regard.	0
ClaimBuster	9484				And I made a good selection.	0
ClaimBuster	9485				And he has a record of weakness with regard to our national defense that is second to none.	0
ClaimBuster	9486				Four years later he is now promising another plan.	1
ClaimBuster	9487				They're making some progress; they need to make more.	0
ClaimBuster	9488				I want to be the one to banish chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth.	0
ClaimBuster	9489				Doesn't make me popular with environmentalists.	0
ClaimBuster	9490				Virtually every economic analysis that I've heard of, including the distinguished Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by, I think, almost everyone, says that even with historically high levels of economic growth, we will suffer a $263 billion deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	9491				But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing.	0
ClaimBuster	9492				Then you have the military and then you have the civilian government.	0
ClaimBuster	9493				Doesn't work any better through the private insurers.	0
ClaimBuster	9494				It's so heavy they'd give you a broken back.	0
ClaimBuster	9495				It shows a lack of leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	9496				And he was not out there urging them to vote for the McCain-Feingold bill.	1
ClaimBuster	9497				If he or representatives of the administration are either with or involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy, or don't pursue that connection in a way that makes it possible for us to cut it off and to be an example to our kids all over the country.	0
ClaimBuster	9498				So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald's not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies...	1
ClaimBuster	9499				Same thing with oil, same thing with natural gas.	1
ClaimBuster	9500				I don't think I need any on-the-job training.	0
ClaimBuster	9501				So he can throw all the kinds of numbers around.	0
ClaimBuster	9502				The President told you in '92 he would cut it 67 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	9503				But you were not an effective senator.	0
ClaimBuster	9504				We're even shipping 3,000 Kurds to Guam.	1
ClaimBuster	9505				Why aren't the NATO questioned -- why aren't they paying?	0
ClaimBuster	9506				I think that to do everything we can to find, as I say, something that would destroy weapons and not humans is a great step forward in human rights.	0
ClaimBuster	9507				In order to defend ourselves, we'd have to get international approval.	0
ClaimBuster	9508				She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter's wedding, number one, and a yoga class.	1
ClaimBuster	9509				... of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	9510				So you add it up.	0
ClaimBuster	9511				This is what we have to do.	0
ClaimBuster	9512				As a matter of fact, we're importing today about one-third less oil from overseas than we did just a year ago.	1
ClaimBuster	9513				I do not say that I have made the decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	9514				"But even after we gave in and said, ""All right, let's discuss it all,'' they walked away from the table."	1
ClaimBuster	9515				As Governor of California, I took charge of passing the strictest air pollution laws in the United States - the strictest air quality law that has even been adopted in the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	9516				A President has to lead his government or it won't be done.	0
ClaimBuster	9517				I want a nation of fairness, where no one is denied the fullness of life or discriminated against, and we deal compassionately with those in our midst who are in trouble.	0
ClaimBuster	9518				According to his own numbers.	0
ClaimBuster	9519				We're funding them √É∆í√Ç¬¢√É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨≈°√Ç¬¨√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚Äú I wish there was more money -- but we're funding them far more than any time in the past, and we're going to keep on doing that.	1
ClaimBuster	9520				And we need that $10 billion a month here in the United States to put people back to work, to do all these wonderful things that Senator McCain suggested we should be doing, but has not yet explained how he would pay for.	1
ClaimBuster	9521				Well, now, I have to start with a smile, since his kind words to me.	0
ClaimBuster	9522				Secondly, we've added a million more children to the ranks of the insured through the Medicaid program.	1
ClaimBuster	9523				And we've got a strong family.	0
ClaimBuster	9524				She got it from the United States Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	9525				You'll never balance the budget by raising taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	9526				They don't enforce these kinds of things.	0
ClaimBuster	9527				But she is raising everybody's taxes massively.	1
ClaimBuster	9528				That's the war against terror.	0
ClaimBuster	9529				They raised the same thing with me on the Pledge of Allegiance.	1
ClaimBuster	9530				We've got to open up the possibilities of this research.	0
ClaimBuster	9531				I think that's a good investment.	0
ClaimBuster	9532				Why would they be saying -- they're not staying there anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	9533				Cutting our education budget, that's not a smart choice.	0
ClaimBuster	9534				And that's why I've tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president.	0
ClaimBuster	9535				Just go to her website.	0
ClaimBuster	9536				We've got to eliminate programs that don't work, and we've got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less.	0
ClaimBuster	9537				They would establish a base in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	9538				They're the ones who have the challenges and they are people out there making predictions that it's not going to be the same.	0
ClaimBuster	9539				So merit selection of judges is the most important single criterion.	0
ClaimBuster	9540				And so we've got to prioritize both our spending side and our tax policies to make sure that they're working for you.	0
ClaimBuster	9541				And Senator Fulbright, Senator Humphrey and I tried to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	9542				I've uh - been one who's loved my nation as many Americans do, and I believe that there's no limit placed on what we can be in the future, if we can harness the tremendous resources - militarily, economically, and the stature of our people, the meaning of the Constitution, in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	9543				Again, I√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ve supported the President on Bosnia, and I think we were told the troops would be out in a year.	1
ClaimBuster	9544				First of all, I don't have a $5 trillion tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	9545				Now last week I guess it was Donna Shalala said well we'll cut Medicare a hundred billion and appoint a commission.	1
ClaimBuster	9546				He's a very fine research, top doctor, at the National Institute of Health, working hard doing something about research on this disease of AIDS.	1
ClaimBuster	9547				I would very much like to get our troops out of there.	0
ClaimBuster	9548				At the same time, however, I have not believed that prayer should be introduced into an election or be a part of a political campaign -- or religion a part of that campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	9549				But as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together.	0
ClaimBuster	9550				I see it all the time when people come up to me and say, I don't want you to let me down again.	0
ClaimBuster	9551				I think that's what leadership is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	9552				They have not done it.	1
ClaimBuster	9553				Well, with regard to this being a personal choice, isn't that what a murderer is insisting on, his or her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that?	0
ClaimBuster	9554				Why do you spend a billion dollars on something you think is a fantasy and a fraud?	0
ClaimBuster	9555				Secretary of State Kissinger has done a superb job in working with the black African nations, the so-called front-line nations.	1
ClaimBuster	9556				And, you know, Governor Romney, I'm glad that you agree that we have been successful in going after Al Qaida, but I have to tell you that, you know, your strategy previously has been one that has been all over the map and is not designed to keep Americans safe or to build on the opportunities that exist in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	9557				Much, much less, but at least we fixed it for some time and 37 to 40 million people get their checks on time.	1
ClaimBuster	9558				We've got to continue everything we can at the federal and the local level.	0
ClaimBuster	9559				It's still the most respected credit.	0
ClaimBuster	9560				That's where I get my name.	1
ClaimBuster	9561				Now the reason they don't have, The reason the President can't support this is pretty obvious.	0
ClaimBuster	9562				The goal here is to take back Mosul.	0
ClaimBuster	9563				And so, the whole matter of what to do with Social Security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation, and it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century.	1
ClaimBuster	9564				And they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like Syria.	1
ClaimBuster	9565				Giving them access to higher education.	1
ClaimBuster	9566				And the only poll I've ever followed is the one that uh - you know, is taken on election day.	0
ClaimBuster	9567				I agree with that, and I did support that law.	1
ClaimBuster	9568				And until we can begin to recreate the basic infrastructure of the great cities of America, particularly in the upper Midwest and in the Northeast, they simply are not going to provide the kind of economic climate that will enable them to retain industry, enable them to retain the kind of solid industrial base that they need, so that they can provide jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	9569				Senator Kennedy has suggested that he believes he knows the way.	1
ClaimBuster	9570				The second fact is that the housing unit for senior citizens that the President dedicated in Buffalo was only made possible through a Federal assistance program for senior citizens that the President's budget sought to terminate.	1
ClaimBuster	9571				You may want to focus on scandal.	0
ClaimBuster	9572				I felt very strongly about it, and I didn't want to go at the time.	0
ClaimBuster	9573				So when Senator McCain proposes a $300 billion tax cut, a continuation not only of the Bush tax cuts, but an additional $200 billion that he's going to give to big corporations, including big oil companies, $4 billion worth, that's money out of the system.	1
ClaimBuster	9574				Well, I fundamentally disagree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	9575				You resisted the appointment of a drug czar there because you thought it might interfere with treatment.	1
ClaimBuster	9576				And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror.	1
ClaimBuster	9577				Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it.	0
ClaimBuster	9578				I've done that with moderation, with care, with thoughtfulness; sometimes consulting experts.	0
ClaimBuster	9579				It's very simple for him to clear it up.	0
ClaimBuster	9580				Well, Martha, first, let me say -- and I've said before, but I'll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it -- that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account.	1
ClaimBuster	9581				But with tax incentives for the low-income groups we could build up their uh - income levels uh - above the poverty level and not uh make welfare more uh - profitable than - than work.	0
ClaimBuster	9582				It's not improving our health care system.	0
ClaimBuster	9583				I would like to see their elimination.	0
ClaimBuster	9584				I think that speaks for itself.	0
ClaimBuster	9585				Now, I have a little time left so let me just say that I get attacked so many times on these questions; it's hard to answer these things.	0
ClaimBuster	9586				A difference between big exploding federal government that wants to think on your behalf and a plan that meets priorities and liberates working people to be able to make decisions on your own.	0
ClaimBuster	9587				I saw a high school that is military.	1
ClaimBuster	9588				I had a discussion with my daughter, Amy, the other day, before I came here, to ask her what the most important issue was.	1
ClaimBuster	9589				We're doing everything we can to protect our borders and ports.	0
ClaimBuster	9590				But the top 1% will end up paying one-third of the taxes in America and they get one-fifth of the benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	9591				This one's kind of old.	1
ClaimBuster	9592				Well, Jim, under my plan all seniors will get prescription drugs under Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	9593				And I've done my best tonight to lay out my plans for going forward to an even better future in the next century.	0
ClaimBuster	9594				I think it's a responsibility, in this respect, in that we should have available and affordable health care to every American citizen, to every family member.	0
ClaimBuster	9595				... the fact is, he's going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we've ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration.	1
ClaimBuster	9596				"""Fortunately, she didn't hold me to that deal."	0
ClaimBuster	9597				And that's why I support that.	0
ClaimBuster	9598				I believe we should not go to the summit until there is some reason to believe that a meeting of minds can be obtained on either Berlin, outer space, or general disarmament - including nuclear testing.	0
ClaimBuster	9599				I have a deep religious faith.	1
ClaimBuster	9600				Sooner or later you get 11 more boys that can run like the devil that weigh 250 pounds and they might win district.	0
ClaimBuster	9601				Now, I have not blocked the SALT II treaty, as Mr. Carter and Mr. Mondale suggest I have.	1
ClaimBuster	9602				I think the major reason for a decrease in participation that we have experienced ever since 1960 has been the deep discouragement of the American people about the performance of public officials.	1
ClaimBuster	9603				Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it's been debunked numerous times.	1
ClaimBuster	9604				I have devoted 24 years of my life to public service and I've said this before and I'll say it again, if you entrust me with the presidency, I may not be the most exciting politician, but I will work hard for you every day.	0
ClaimBuster	9605				But there are a lot of refugees, women and children -- think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he'd been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces.	1
ClaimBuster	9606				Production on government land of oil is down 14 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	9607				As a matter of fact,.	0
ClaimBuster	9608				The American people are ready to make sacrifices if they are part of the process.	0
ClaimBuster	9609				We sit on a conspicuous stage.	0
ClaimBuster	9610				We've had a uh - higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years.	1
ClaimBuster	9611				You're going to be examining our proposals tonight and in the future, and energy independence is a way to do that, is one of them.	0
ClaimBuster	9612				three ways to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	9613				I live in a state where manufacturing job growth has far outpaced the nation in the last few years, where we have created more private sector jobs since Mr. Bush has been president than have been created in the entire rest of the country, where Mr. Bush's labor secretary said job growth has been enormous.	1
ClaimBuster	9614				Now, many here who are not involved in farming don't -- won't follow this, so just forgive me.	0
ClaimBuster	9615				I think those are pretty important priorities.	0
ClaimBuster	9616				When President Bush came into office, we had a budget surplus and the national debt was a little over $5 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	9617				Yes, I've been very specific about those, John.	0
ClaimBuster	9618				But I think uh - uh - a balanced approach, with everybody being part of it and a striving for unselfishness, could help as it did in 1973 to let people sacrifice for their own country.	0
ClaimBuster	9619				And we have to be very strong.	0
ClaimBuster	9620				I mean, you can like it or not like it.	0
ClaimBuster	9621				I don't think you do think that.	0
ClaimBuster	9622				You can't let public persuasion sway you, because the job is to enforce the law.	0
ClaimBuster	9623				When you've got thousands of people right now in Iowa, right now in Colorado, who are working, creating wind power with good-paying manufacturing jobs, and the Republican senator in that -- in Iowa is all for it, providing tax breaks (ph) to help this work and Governor Romney says I'm opposed.	1
ClaimBuster	9624				(Laughter) But I also think it's important to be somebody who is willing to make those tough choices.	0
ClaimBuster	9625				I think we should support the people of Serbia and Yugoslavia, as they call the Serbia plus Montenegro, and put pressure in every way possible to recognize the lawful outcome of the election.	0
ClaimBuster	9626				Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.	1
ClaimBuster	9627				But we have to have a president who is clear that you don't deal with Russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul.	0
ClaimBuster	9628				I'd like to thank the computer executives and the electronics executives in Silicon Valley, two-thirds of whom are Republicans who said they wanted to sign on to a change in America.	1
ClaimBuster	9629				We're facing a group of folks who have such hatred in their heart, they'll strike anywhere, with any means.	0
ClaimBuster	9630				You can't tell me that a surplus food distribution of five cents po- per person - and that n- nearly six million Americans receiving that - is adequate.	1
ClaimBuster	9631				Japan spends a little over 6% of its gross national product.	1
ClaimBuster	9632				It's who you trust, government or people.	0
ClaimBuster	9633				We need to step up exchange; we need to step up technical assistance so that trained people in these newly developing countries can operate the economies.	0
ClaimBuster	9634				The one thing I have done is lay it squarely on the table in front of the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	9635				Under my leadership we're going to win this war in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	9636				We talked about the economy is more important.	1
ClaimBuster	9637				Then you go to your own pharmacy.	0
ClaimBuster	9638				But I am happy, in fact I'm thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation, because it is a world-renowned charity and I am so proud of the work that it does.	0
ClaimBuster	9639				We're talking about some difference.	0
ClaimBuster	9640				But when these huge deficits went in place in 1981, what's called the real interest rates -- the spread between inflation and what a loan costs you doubled -- and that's still the case today.	1
ClaimBuster	9641				They don't want just Quemoy and Matsu; they don't want just Formosa; they want the world.	0
ClaimBuster	9642				But whether I agree or disagree with some individual, or what he may say, or how he may say it, I don't think there's any way that we can suggest that because people believe in God and go to church, that they should not want reflected in those people and those causes they support, their own belief in morality, and in the high traditions and principles which we've abandoned so much in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	9643				As you all know, I've been buying 30-minute segments to talk about issues.	1
ClaimBuster	9644				Free trade between ourselves and Colombia, I just recited to you the benefits of concluding that agreement, a billion dollars of American dollars that could have gone to creating jobs and businesses in the United States, opening up those markets.	1
ClaimBuster	9645				And that's the testimony of uh - General Twining and the Assistant Secretary of State in fifty-eight.	1
ClaimBuster	9646				And it's a West Texas painting, a painting of a mountain scene.	1
ClaimBuster	9647				But, again, I want to tell the American people, we're doing everything we can at home, but you better have a president who chases these terrorists down and bring them to justice before they hurt us again.	0
ClaimBuster	9648				Ronald Reagan was the last president...	1
ClaimBuster	9649				But I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are -- she doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking.	1
ClaimBuster	9650				And you know the only time it's ever been invoked?	0
ClaimBuster	9651				Most of all, I'd like to thank all of you who have touched me in some way over this last year, all the thousands of you whom I've seen.	0
ClaimBuster	9652				Now, as far as running away from my party is concerned, Senator Kennedy has said that we have no compassion for the poor, that we are against progress - the enemies of progress, is the term that he's used, and the like.	1
ClaimBuster	9653				They said even if we are the strongest if we don√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢t do something if we don't have a clear vision of the military, if we don't stop extending our troops all around the world and nation building missions, then we're going to have a serious problem coming down the road, and I'm going to prevent that.	0
ClaimBuster	9654				We've got to strengthen the family.	0
ClaimBuster	9655				If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess.	0
ClaimBuster	9656				Well, I think Governor Clinton is committed.	0
ClaimBuster	9657				I think it also is a strength.	0
ClaimBuster	9658				A President must know right then.	0
ClaimBuster	9659				The when I can't tell you.	0
ClaimBuster	9660				And it seemed to me if you want to send a signal, you've got to send a signal, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	9661				Our nation in the last eight years has been divided as never before.	0
ClaimBuster	9662				"Several months ago the Vietnam government said, ""We are ready to sit down and negotiate for release of information on MIAs."	1
ClaimBuster	9663				And I'm glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy.	0
ClaimBuster	9664				And if you end up losing your health care from your employer, you've got to go out on the open market and try to buy it.	0
ClaimBuster	9665				And therefore, I've made some proposals to strengthen the domestic oil industry by more incentive going in to look for, and find, and produce oil; made some incentives in terms of secondary and tertiary production.	1
ClaimBuster	9666				If you were an effective senator, you could have done it.	0
ClaimBuster	9667				Of course the president will take credit for that.	0
ClaimBuster	9668				With respect to Iran, the British, French, and Germans were the ones who initiated an effort without the United States, regrettably, to begin to try to move to curb the nuclear possibilities in Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	9669				It's not only what's your philosophy and what's your position on issues, but can you get things done?	0
ClaimBuster	9670				There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.	0
ClaimBuster	9671				The Governor talks about limits, what we can't do, opposes these two modernization systems, talks now about well, we'll develop some new kind of a missile.	0
ClaimBuster	9672				And that's why early in my administration I called the attorney general and the U. S. attorneys and said: Put together a task force all around the country to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns.	1
ClaimBuster	9673				They produce the most jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	9674				In addition to that, jobs programs to re-employ the youth in our cities would be very high on my priority list, both the Youth Opportunities Act of 1980 and a billion-dollar program that I would recommend to put youth to work in energy projects, in conservation projects, in projects that would carry out some of the great national goals of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	9675				I'm totally focussed on the fact that we still could have enterprise zones, according to both parties, but we don't.	1
ClaimBuster	9676				And you look at a who's who in these campaigns around the 2 candidates.	0
ClaimBuster	9677				Our relations with Japan have never been better.	0
ClaimBuster	9678				Now I don't know all the answers.	0
ClaimBuster	9679				We're up to $20 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	9680				We talk about fiscal matters.	0
ClaimBuster	9681				I've spent my entire life in the service of this nation and putting my country first.	1
ClaimBuster	9682				When we're talking about math that doesn't add up, how about $4 trillion of deficits over the last four years, $5 trillion?	1
ClaimBuster	9683				There's too much special interests and too many lobbyists working there.	0
ClaimBuster	9684				We're going to train troops, and we are.	0
ClaimBuster	9685				It is the bipartisan bill that is now pending in the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	9686				The great contest for the presidency is about the future, who can lead, who can get things done.	0
ClaimBuster	9687				We're now working on the communications industry.	1
ClaimBuster	9688				We only have ten divisions now.	1
ClaimBuster	9689				It is something that Congress has proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	9690				But no matter what it takes in the future to keep Social Security sound, it must be kept that way.	0
ClaimBuster	9691				Number two, we've got to make sure that we have the best education system in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	9692				This is not mud slinging.	0
ClaimBuster	9693				Well, we always, with the normal growth in our country and increase in population, increase the number of jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	9694				And he said that the reason he changed his mind was, in part, because he was seeking the endorsement of the National Rifle Association.	1
ClaimBuster	9695				But we also have every right to expect the Russians to behave in a fashion and keeping with a -- with a -- with a country who respects international boundaries and the norms of international behavior.	0
ClaimBuster	9696				He has every right to exercise his passion, as what he said, a strong, progressive liberal.	0
ClaimBuster	9697				It was a glorious day.	0
ClaimBuster	9698				I believe experience counts, but it's not everything.	0
ClaimBuster	9699				I've seen the family values of my people in Arkansas.	0
ClaimBuster	9700				He said that many of these countries equate space developments with scientific productivity and scientific advancement.	1
ClaimBuster	9701				What I do believe is that we can find good, common ground on issues of parental consent or parental notification.	0
ClaimBuster	9702				And I attempted, as many have in the past, of including that so that it is constitutional.	1
ClaimBuster	9703				It starts with a billion dollar pay raise for the men and women who wear the uniform.	1
ClaimBuster	9704				We have to change that.	0
ClaimBuster	9705				But I also believe we need an agricultural policy which doesn't cost us 15 to 20 to 25 billion dollars a year that it's been costing us over the course of the past three or four years under this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	9706				I will keep us strong, but you'll not do that unless you command that budget and make certain we get the strength that we need.	0
ClaimBuster	9707				And so we took the right action and didn't allow contaminated medicine into our country.	1
ClaimBuster	9708				And if I'm elected president that's gonna be a top priority of mine to completely revise the structure of the federal government, to make it economical, efficient, purposeful and manageable for a change.	0
ClaimBuster	9709				"It's the side to see the day that is coming, not to see the day that is gone. """	0
ClaimBuster	9710				Over the last eight years, we've seen that dream diminish.	0
ClaimBuster	9711				But I don't want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them.	1
ClaimBuster	9712				And Donald knows a lot about this.	0
ClaimBuster	9713				Which is a worse decision?	0
ClaimBuster	9714				But let's talk about the question you asked, Lester.	0
ClaimBuster	9715				I look forward to the final weeks of this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	9716				We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them.	0
ClaimBuster	9717				I'll do it by more drilling, more permits and licenses.	0
ClaimBuster	9718				We can't say we're going to do things and then not explain in concrete terms how we're going to pay for it.	0
ClaimBuster	9719				When I get to Washington, coming in as an outsider, one of the major responsibilities that - that I will have on my shoulder is a complete reorganization of the - of the executive branch of government.	0
ClaimBuster	9720				That's how in banking it works.	0
ClaimBuster	9721				Let's vow to work together to do something about it.	0
ClaimBuster	9722				Natural gas production is the highest it's been in decades.	1
ClaimBuster	9723				Look, the world's temperature is going up, weather patterns are changing, storms are getting more violent and unpredictable.	1
ClaimBuster	9724				I'm just trying to keep up with John.	0
ClaimBuster	9725				But when it comes to our military, what we have to think about is not, you know just budgets, we've got to think about capabilities.	0
ClaimBuster	9726				I had a single mom and my grandparents raised me and it was because of the help of scholarships and my grandmother scrimping on things that she might have wanted to purchase and my mom, at one point, getting food stamps in order for us to put food on the table.	1
ClaimBuster	9727				He was a fantastic governor of Missouri.	0
ClaimBuster	9728				And one of the reasons that's important is that Israel cannot have direct dialogue with some of the people on the other side of conflicts, especially during times of tension, unless that dialogue comes through us.	0
ClaimBuster	9729				One of the 2 groups has raised it to an art form.	1
ClaimBuster	9730				If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government.	0
ClaimBuster	9731				I raise the child-care credit by $1,000 for families to help them be able to take care of their kids.	1
ClaimBuster	9732				I don't uh - look at the picture as bleakly as you have indicated in your question, Mr. Trewhitt.	0
ClaimBuster	9733				We changed many provisions I authored, cover preexisting conditions, portability, and there are other things we can do.	1
ClaimBuster	9734				We also need to have a great reduction in agencies and programs.	0
ClaimBuster	9735				And inflation hits everybody: those who are working and those who are on welfare.	1
ClaimBuster	9736				-- all of these wonderful folks are going to have a chance to get some of their questions answered.	0
ClaimBuster	9737				And one last point I want to make.	0
ClaimBuster	9738				So we're going to make sure that people we trade with around the world play by the rules.	0
ClaimBuster	9739				I think these crimes are different.	0
ClaimBuster	9740				When it comes to going after Osama bin Laden, you said, well, any president would make that call.	1
ClaimBuster	9741				That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders, OK?	1
ClaimBuster	9742				Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently.	1
ClaimBuster	9743				As a matter of fact, Mr. Ford has made a political football out of the defense budget.	1
ClaimBuster	9744				I salute those who participate in the political process.	0
ClaimBuster	9745				And I think it was Justice Black who talked about great nations, like great men, must keep their word.	0
ClaimBuster	9746				It's not taking anything away from schools, it's new money.	0
ClaimBuster	9747				And the significance of prestige, really, is because we're so identified with the cause of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	9748				That's why we have, as I said, people under federal indictment and charges.	0
ClaimBuster	9749				Will we use the prosperity to enrich all of our families and not just a few?	0
ClaimBuster	9750				And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling.	0
ClaimBuster	9751				And -- and -- we should not have wasted these four years to the extent they -- they continue to be able to spin these centrifuges and get that much closer.	0
ClaimBuster	9752				That's why everything I'll do is designed to help small businesses grow and add jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	9753				One, we need more community health centers.	0
ClaimBuster	9754				But you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didn't even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable.	0
ClaimBuster	9755				We're doing a little better in interdiction.	0
ClaimBuster	9756				I don't think top-down works in America.	0
ClaimBuster	9757				We need to stand for human rights.	0
ClaimBuster	9758				Well, just listen to what you heard.	0
ClaimBuster	9759				So whether it's diabetes or cancer, they come to hospitals later and it costs America more.	1
ClaimBuster	9760				I favor strict controls on how much you can spend running for Congress, strict limits on political action committees, requirements that people running for Congress appear in open public debates like we're doing now.	0
ClaimBuster	9761				We know freedom is a powerful, powerful, powerful force, much bigger than the United States of America, as we saw recently in the Balkans.	0
ClaimBuster	9762				I have a $4,000 tuition tax credit that goes to parents -- and kids, if they're earning for themselves -- to be able to pay for college.	1
ClaimBuster	9763				In the terrorist situation, there are terrorist factions all over.	0
ClaimBuster	9764				Overall in America cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last four years, casual drug use down 13 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	9765				If you'd pass that message on to him.	0
ClaimBuster	9766				Number two is for people coming along that are young, what I do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan.	0
ClaimBuster	9767				I would like to make a change in the regulation that discriminates against a wife who works and finds that she then is faced with a choice between her father's or her husband's benefits, if he dies first, or what she has paid in; but it does not recognize that she has also been paying in herself, and she is entitled to more than she presently can get.	0
ClaimBuster	9768				It will not be our ambition that will determine it, because greatness is not something that is written on a campaign poster.	0
ClaimBuster	9769				There was only four of us there.	1
ClaimBuster	9770				A family involves at least one parent, whether natural or adoptive or foster, and children.	1
ClaimBuster	9771				And in 12 years as governor I guess I've taken on every interest group there was in my state at one time or another to fight for change.	1
ClaimBuster	9772				He is for registration of guns.	1
ClaimBuster	9773				And now we're fighting them now.	1
ClaimBuster	9774				Labels don't fit, ladies and gentlemen.	0
ClaimBuster	9775				People are going to get paid.	0
ClaimBuster	9776				Now, accountability, we basically agree on accountability.	0
ClaimBuster	9777				We wanted to preserve human dignity in southern Africa.	0
ClaimBuster	9778				See, if I say anything it's going to be misconstrued.	0
ClaimBuster	9779				I don't have any plan to cut education funding and -- and grants that go to people going to college.	0
ClaimBuster	9780				We ought to be shutting those down.	0
ClaimBuster	9781				Who gave it that name?	0
ClaimBuster	9782				It's not going to work if we open up a dialogue with Kim Jong Il.	0
ClaimBuster	9783				Well, I think you're overlooking that we have had major accomplishments in the first term.	1
ClaimBuster	9784				Well, I think the fact that they're facing these repeated call-ups, some of them two and three deployments, and there's a stop- loss policy that prevents people from being able to get out when their time was up, is a reflection of the bad judgment this president exercised in how he has engaged in the world and deployed our forces.	1
ClaimBuster	9785				The Vice President talks about a thousand points of light.	1
ClaimBuster	9786				If a president doesn't reach out and bring people in and be inclusive, then how are we going to get over those barriers?	0
ClaimBuster	9787				A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in Wisconsin and Minnesota, he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so.	0
ClaimBuster	9788				I think there was a good opportunity to bring Republicans and Democrats together to reform the Social Security system so seniors will never go without.	0
ClaimBuster	9789				In the last two years, I have made policy decisions involving - long-range difficulties and policies and made day-to-day judgments not only as president of the United States but as the leader of the free world What is the result of that leadership?	1
ClaimBuster	9790				And that's because we're doing exactly what we should be doing to try to promote a moderate Syrian leadership and a -- an effective transition so that we get Assad out.	0
ClaimBuster	9791				But this is a very liberal administration.	0
ClaimBuster	9792				You know the Japanese are breathing down our necks on this.	0
ClaimBuster	9793				The president's policies throughout the Middle East began with an apology tour and -- and -- and pursue a strategy of leading from behind, and this strategy is unraveling before our very eyes.	0
ClaimBuster	9794				We ought to do that, then we can have a commission.	0
ClaimBuster	9795				"You chose not to because you were afraid of the appointment of, quote, ""conservative judges."""	0
ClaimBuster	9796				And this weakened our relationships with Israel a great deal and put a cloud on the total commitment that our people feel toward the Israelis.	0
ClaimBuster	9797				It had several tax increases phased in over a period of time -- there are two more yet to come between now and 1989.	1
ClaimBuster	9798				You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have -- and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times.	1
ClaimBuster	9799				Do people want to be identified with us?	0
ClaimBuster	9800				I don't claim to know his heart.	1
ClaimBuster	9801				What I will do is I'll put in place an employment verification system and make sure that employers that hire people who have come here illegally are sanctioned for doing so.	0
ClaimBuster	9802				I have traveled to forty-eight of the fifty states and in my travels I have learned what the people of the United States are thinking about.	1
ClaimBuster	9803				Governor -- here -- here's -- here's one thing...	0
ClaimBuster	9804				"They went to him 5 days before they were killed and said, ""Please, take them out of there.''"	1
ClaimBuster	9805				Let me, Jason, come back to you a minute because there is a big difference in the defense budget.	0
ClaimBuster	9806				And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe.	0
ClaimBuster	9807				I'd never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we're going to really make lives better for people.	0
ClaimBuster	9808				In addition to that, we have to move on other areas that are holding back growth.	0
ClaimBuster	9809				But he's an incumbent, and we've got to look at all the facts.	1
ClaimBuster	9810				Words matter when you run for president.	0
ClaimBuster	9811				And I believe it incumbent upon us to be the defenders of the United States and the defenders of freedom; and to do that, we must give this country leadership and we must get America moving again.	0
ClaimBuster	9812				People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more.	1
ClaimBuster	9813				And I think now we've got a problem.	0
ClaimBuster	9814				Let me just point out, just today in the Los Angeles Times Clyde Prestowitz, who was one of President Reagan's leading trade advisers and a life-long conservative Republican, endorsed my candidacy because he knows that I'll have a free and fair trade policy, a hard-headed, realistic policy, and not get caught up in rubber-stamping everything the Bush administration did.	1
ClaimBuster	9815				And I would like to see us a little more free, as we once were.	0
ClaimBuster	9816				We've been uh - having a very clear decision in the last eight years.	0
ClaimBuster	9817				I think the matter is settled once and for all.	0
ClaimBuster	9818				And I've been very clear to them.	0
ClaimBuster	9819				"My message to our troops is, ""Thank you for what you're doing."	0
ClaimBuster	9820				I've never depended on powerful political figures to put me in office.	0
ClaimBuster	9821				... because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I'm not surprised.	1
ClaimBuster	9822				Well, mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	9823				And that record shows he just hasn't been able to cut the deficit, to put in place reforms for Medicare and Social Security to preserve them, to get us the rising incomes we need.	1
ClaimBuster	9824				I vetoed 993 measures without having a veto overturned.	1
ClaimBuster	9825				I don't think the American people believe that.	0
ClaimBuster	9826				Does this show that Communism has the bigger pull, or freedom has the bigger pull?	0
ClaimBuster	9827				So she talks about taking them out.	0
ClaimBuster	9828				The question is, will we be better off four years from now than we are today?	0
ClaimBuster	9829				But I have -- thanks to my mother, God rest her soul -- the firmest possible belief and faith in God.	0
ClaimBuster	9830				And when people vote, I think you're going to see a very strong verdict by the American people that they favor the approach that I'm talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	9831				I want to make sure prescription drugs are available for all seniors.	0
ClaimBuster	9832				And secondly, in terms of the cutting of the Coast Guard, the Democratic controlled Congress, so please help us with that, who cut $70 million from the Coast Guard out of the interdiction effort on narcotics.	1
ClaimBuster	9833				I believe in being strong and resolute and determined.	0
ClaimBuster	9834				He says that he's going to give you a $5,000 tax credit.	1
ClaimBuster	9835				But you want to know the truth?	0
ClaimBuster	9836				And in a way, I should be complaining.	0
ClaimBuster	9837				We have met your sons and daughters.	1
ClaimBuster	9838				And I don't think a lot of people are going to want to keep what they have today.	0
ClaimBuster	9839				Are we going to double on top-down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says America does best when the middle class does best?	0
ClaimBuster	9840				Now, to go back to your question, Nikki, we're not getting the best cooperation in the world today.	0
ClaimBuster	9841				Now, Governor Romney has taken a different approach throughout this campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	9842				This is basically a problem that is a primary concern to the European Community.	0
ClaimBuster	9843				Nobody running can promise that, there's too much change in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	9844				It's been very well studied.	1
ClaimBuster	9845				And we don't want to waste taxpayer money.	0
ClaimBuster	9846				We sent it over to the House, that you could import drugs.	1
ClaimBuster	9847				They tried to have a national health care plan.	1
ClaimBuster	9848				And that's why this election is so terribly important.	0
ClaimBuster	9849				And I suspect one of us will have a pick at the end of next year -- the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	9850				Now, I know the criticism of this.	0
ClaimBuster	9851				I'll tell the American people, but this man said I'll get you a million dollars a day in pro bono advertising, something that's very hard for the government to do.	1
ClaimBuster	9852				Let me tell you who I associate with.	0
ClaimBuster	9853				Our home initiative -- our home ownership initiative -- HOPE -- that passed the Congress is a good start for having people own their own homes instead of living in these deadly tenements.	1
ClaimBuster	9854				Part of my tax package which is paid for in my balanced budget plan would exempt up to half a million dollars in gains from people when they sell their homes, which I think is the biggest capital gains benefit we could give to most ordinary Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	9855				So one of the things that I think we have to recognize is pursuing the same kinds of policies that we pursued over the last eight years is not going to bring down the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	9856				We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China.	0
ClaimBuster	9857				I don't have a response.	1
ClaimBuster	9858				And we need a fresh start, a new credibility, a president who can bring allies to our side.	0
ClaimBuster	9859				Governor, the people in Detroit don't forget.	0
ClaimBuster	9860				And there's just not going to be enough money.	0
ClaimBuster	9861				We can't impose it, but we need to nourish it and that's the kind of thing that I would do as president -- follow those three commitments into the future.	0
ClaimBuster	9862				So I'm not planning on making changes there.	0
ClaimBuster	9863				The FDA has made its decision.	1
ClaimBuster	9864				And so the question is how to get them going again.	0
ClaimBuster	9865				And Mr. Ford hasn't done anything about it.	1
ClaimBuster	9866				That's the way I would do it.	0
ClaimBuster	9867				The point is, they'll get to decide what to think.	0
ClaimBuster	9868				The fact is for the last few years in the Congress, we've faced a lot of opposition to them.	0
ClaimBuster	9869				I don't believe that's the way to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	9870				We -- we need to have -- we need to have employers reward employees who join health clubs and practice wellness and fitness.	0
ClaimBuster	9871				The fact is that the Kyoto treaty was flawed.	0
ClaimBuster	9872				It is essential that a man who's president of this country certainly stand for every program that will mean for growth.	0
ClaimBuster	9873				And, you know, we can't be -- we can't allow ourselves to get overextended.	0
ClaimBuster	9874				Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community.	1
ClaimBuster	9875				Part of the problem here is that for many of you, wages and incomes have flat-lined.	0
ClaimBuster	9876				And we have former members of Congress now residing in federal prison because of the evils of this earmarking and pork-barrel spending.	1
ClaimBuster	9877				Sixty to seventy percent of our colored children do not finish high school.	1
ClaimBuster	9878				But she is absolutely right.	0
ClaimBuster	9879				Number two, we take some programs that we are doing to keep, like Medicaid, which is a program for the poor; we'll take that healthcare program for the poor and we give it to the states to run because states run these programs more efficiently.	1
ClaimBuster	9880				It was very easy to do.	0
ClaimBuster	9881				And what we can now do is free up some resources, to, for example, put Americans back to work, especially our veterans, rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our schools, making sure that, you know, our veterans are getting the care that they need when it comes to post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, making sure that the certifications that they need for good jobs of the future are in place.	0
ClaimBuster	9882				None of them uh are responsible for health care itself.	0
ClaimBuster	9883				You take the raw product you produce, I presume you're a farmer, off your farm, and you convert it.	0
ClaimBuster	9884				Our Government has, in the last year or so, taken out of multiple use millions of acres of public lands that once were - well, they were public lands subject to multiple use - exploration for minerals and so forth.	1
ClaimBuster	9885				President Obama -- Anderson, excuse me.	0
ClaimBuster	9886				And I, for one, am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position.	1
ClaimBuster	9887				And maybe it's hardly doable.	0
ClaimBuster	9888				Look, the cost of lowering rates for everybody across the board, 20 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	9889				Whether we're going to give our children a world-class education.	0
ClaimBuster	9890				That means he'll either have to raise your taxes by $900 billion or go into the Social Security surplus for $900 billion.	0
ClaimBuster	9891				I have just signed legislation to add to our ability to deal, along with our allies, with this terrorist problem.	1
ClaimBuster	9892				Well, we've gone through a tough four years.	0
ClaimBuster	9893				Now, what he doesn't tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	9894				Now Senator McCain and I agree with your idea that we've got to help homeowners.	0
ClaimBuster	9895				I am going to renegotiate NAFTA.	0
ClaimBuster	9896				We can do much, much better, but we ought not try to convince the American people that America is a country that's coming apart at the seams.	0
ClaimBuster	9897				We've never let the Congress and the Foreign Relations, Senate Intelligence Committees see them.	1
ClaimBuster	9898				I ran one of the largest district attorney's offices in America, one of the ten largest.	1
ClaimBuster	9899				You haven't seen the commercial?	0
ClaimBuster	9900				That's not what the Constitution says.	0
ClaimBuster	9901				He talked about the reconstruction efforts that are beginning to take hold.	1
ClaimBuster	9902				Number five, champion small business.	0
ClaimBuster	9903				Some of it was excised, but the part dealing with political terrorism was continued.	0
ClaimBuster	9904				And I'm going to make it a priority.	0
ClaimBuster	9905				My uncle was a victim of poisonous gas there.	1
ClaimBuster	9906				Let me address it but also talk about the weapons the president just talked about, because every part of the president's answer just now promises you more of the same over the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	9907				And so, the answer to your question is: When our general is on the ground and Ambassador Negroponte tells me that Iraq is ready to defend herself from these terrorists, that elections will have been held by then, that their stability and that they're on their way to, you know, a nation that's free; that's when.	0
ClaimBuster	9908				We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt.	1
ClaimBuster	9909				And now we have all these people just up the road in Los Angeles County, we have people from 150 different racial and ethnic groups and tons of different religions, but the fundamental tenets of virtually every religion are the same, and what I try to do is to support policies that would respect religion and then help parents inculcate those values to their children.	1
ClaimBuster	9910				Four years ago, right here in this forum, he was asked the same question: Can't people be able to import drugs from Canada?	1
ClaimBuster	9911				If it says tilt, you don't get any gun.	0
ClaimBuster	9912				Before Senator Dole left the Senate, he and Mr. Gingrich also were recommending that we pass these tax cuts only insofar as we could pay for them.	1
ClaimBuster	9913				As far as Berlin is concerned, there isn't any question about the necessity of defending Berlin; the rights of people there to be free; and there isn't any question about what the united American people - Republicans and Democrats alike - would do in the event there were an attempt by the Communists to take over Berlin.	0
ClaimBuster	9914				All I know is that we have firm government credit to guarantee the pensions.	1
ClaimBuster	9915				We had the highest fatalities among U.S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002.	1
ClaimBuster	9916				We're number one in autos again, record numbers of new small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	9917				Jack Kemp is my running mate, doing an outstanding job.	1
ClaimBuster	9918				And if you just add the numbers up, he still hasn't denied it, he spends more money on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1% than all his new proposals for prescription drugs, healthcare, education, and national defense combined.	1
ClaimBuster	9919				We can do better than that.	0
ClaimBuster	9920				And I know that they know that I'll take care of them.	0
ClaimBuster	9921				That's going to help Jeremy get a job.	0
ClaimBuster	9922				I believe we ought to give seniors more options.	0
ClaimBuster	9923				Let me say something about Columbine.	0
ClaimBuster	9924				Well, I have no idea.	0
ClaimBuster	9925				Somebody that can come to Washington and say let's forget all the finger pointing and get positive things done on Medicare, prescription drugs, Social Security, and so I take him for his word.	0
ClaimBuster	9926				I come out of the Democratic party, which in this century has produced Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, and which supported and sustained these programs which I've discussed tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	9927				I think I've addressed it.	0
ClaimBuster	9928				We have not maintained our position and our prestige.	0
ClaimBuster	9929				I'm all for oil production.	0
ClaimBuster	9930				I mean, there needs to be a wholesale effort against racial profiling, which is illiterate children.	0
ClaimBuster	9931				And we built up uh - an awareness among the uh - voters of this country, particularly those in whose primaries I entered - thirty of them, nobody's ever done that before - about who I was and what I stood for.	0
ClaimBuster	9932				The worst inflation since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	9933				And so we -- we -- we've got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump -- and, you know, winter's coming and home heating oil -- as it is our national security and the issue of climate change that's so important.	0
ClaimBuster	9934				This is a four-star general.	1
ClaimBuster	9935				And when she said deplorables, she meant it.	0
ClaimBuster	9936				And that begins with a strong economy here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	9937				It's been one of secrecy and exclusion.	0
ClaimBuster	9938				"And if he had been in power, in other words, if we would have said, ""Let the inspectors work, or let's, you know, hope to talk him out."	0
ClaimBuster	9939				He has voted in the United States Senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42,000 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	9940				You worry about the quality and the safety of your children, and the quality of education.	0
ClaimBuster	9941				I think we have to revita1ize our society.	0
ClaimBuster	9942				I would work with our allies in Asia, in Europe, in the Middle East, and elsewhere.	0
ClaimBuster	9943				I would have uh - done it opposite.	0
ClaimBuster	9944				Yes, you can lick inflation by increasing productivity and by decreasing the cost of government to the place that we have balanced budgets, and are no longer grinding out printing press money, flooding the market with it because the Government is spending more than it takes in.	0
ClaimBuster	9945				I wrote about that in my book...	1
ClaimBuster	9946				There won't be 10 millionaires and 14 lawyers in the cabinet.	0
ClaimBuster	9947				Why should they insure somebody when the government's going to insure it for them?	0
ClaimBuster	9948				The Department of Energy has a multi-billion-dollar budget in excess of $10 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	9949				I would never and have never in all the years I've been there imposed a litmus test on any nominee to the court.	1
ClaimBuster	9950				We have done things to help small businesses, agriculture, and so much else.	1
ClaimBuster	9951				"He said, back in 2006, ""Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money."""	1
ClaimBuster	9952				It's your money, it's a part of your retirement benefit.	1
ClaimBuster	9953				I understand the limited role of the federal government, but it could be a constructive role when it comes to reform, by insisting that there be a strong accountability systems.	0
ClaimBuster	9954				"One is Strobe Talbott in his classic book, ""Deadly Gambits.''"	0
ClaimBuster	9955				And they want this country to go in a new direction.	0
ClaimBuster	9956				My friends, we have gone to all four corners of the Earth and shed American blood in defense, usually, of somebody else's freedom and our own.	1
ClaimBuster	9957				Saddam Hussein now sits in a prison cell.	1
ClaimBuster	9958				Two days ago we ate lunch at a restaurant.	1
ClaimBuster	9959				Again, see, I didn't create this problem.	1
ClaimBuster	9960				Look, I respect his children.	0
ClaimBuster	9961				He said that these missiles were less dangerous than ballistic missiles because you could fire them, and you could recall them if you decided there'd been a miscalculation.	1
ClaimBuster	9962				She talks about health care.	1
ClaimBuster	9963				And I share them with him.	0
ClaimBuster	9964				We've spent $4.7 billion a year in the State of Texas for uninsured people.	1
ClaimBuster	9965				One of my concerns, though, is I don't want to federalize the local police forces.	0
ClaimBuster	9966				I don't have to worry in the near term about the Federal Reserve.	0
ClaimBuster	9967				And I honor their sacrifices.	0
ClaimBuster	9968				A charter school run by some people from Teach For America.	1
ClaimBuster	9969				So, yes, I told the American Legion National!	0
ClaimBuster	9970				And then we'll fill other gaps by covering the parents of those children when the family is poor or up to two and a half times the poverty rate.	0
ClaimBuster	9971				We have -- as I said, we've let government get completely out of control.	0
ClaimBuster	9972				... 600 -- wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times.	0
ClaimBuster	9973				To destroy life to save life is -- it's one of the real ethical dilemmas that we face.	0
ClaimBuster	9974				It doesn't set a times schedule.	0
ClaimBuster	9975				What is more moral than peace, and the United States is at peace today?	0
ClaimBuster	9976				I think it would be a great gesture.	0
ClaimBuster	9977				She doesn't have the look.	0
ClaimBuster	9978				And the magnitude of the tax cuts that you're talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow.	0
ClaimBuster	9979				He apparently wants to spend billions on the MX on railroad cars, a weapons system we don't need and can't afford.	0
ClaimBuster	9980				As the politics change, his positions change.	0
ClaimBuster	9981				He wants you to believe that because he can't come here and tell you that he's created new jobs for America.	0
ClaimBuster	9982				the tone we've just heard might just be the tone we have for the rest of the campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	9983				We've always been a nation which was ambitious for America and we move forward.	0
ClaimBuster	9984				But what did we learn with DNC?	0
ClaimBuster	9985				The important point here is, though, the American people have become so cynical about our politics, because all they see is a tit- for-tat and back-and-forth.	0
ClaimBuster	9986				"And I think if we get rid of the labels--and I'm not keeping count, but I think Mr. Bush has used the label ""liberal"" at least ten times if I had a dollar, George, for every time you used that label, I'd qualify for one of those tax breaks for the rich that you want to give away."	0
ClaimBuster	9987				And 95 percent of working families, 95 percent of you out there, will get a tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	9988				I don't think that anybody can say that Johnson and Kennedy neglected the poor and the destitute people in this country or around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	9989				The trial lawyers and I don't -- you know, my wife's a lawyer.	1
ClaimBuster	9990				They want those civil rights laws enforced.	0
ClaimBuster	9991				It is not midnight in America, Senator.	1
ClaimBuster	9992				This is a place where my opponent and I have strong disagreement.	1
ClaimBuster	9993				I think that that's an important part of being a parent.	0
ClaimBuster	9994				They want the equal rights amendment ratified.	0
ClaimBuster	9995				Number two, on the question of the U-2 flights.	0
ClaimBuster	9996				You know, mine doesn't work that way.	0
ClaimBuster	9997				Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism.	1
ClaimBuster	9998				In some ways this is just a new label for something that has been going on for years.	1
ClaimBuster	9999				It would only give us a few months' worth of oil and the oil wouldn't start flowing for many years into the future.	0
ClaimBuster	10000				That's twice the amount of rate of return than the current Social Security Trust.	1
ClaimBuster	10001				That wasn't best for me and I knew it in the very beginning.	0
ClaimBuster	10002				Because when you do not tax, and tax enough to pay for your outgo, you pay it many times over in higher prices and inflation; and I simply will not do that.	0
ClaimBuster	10003				We got Kuwait back to the emir but he's still not his nuclear, his chemical, his bacteriological and he's still over there, right?	0
ClaimBuster	10004				That means you can take a line and cut out some of the pork out of a meaningful bill.	0
ClaimBuster	10005				He's extending the Administration's commitment.	1
ClaimBuster	10006				And it permits - economists on the East Coast and West think it's good - it permits the president to sort out the priorities, and we continue to grow because I will not raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	10007				And months ago, many of us were pressing for action.	1
ClaimBuster	10008				Has an 11 year old son and can't let that son compete in sports and Little League, because he's afraid he's going to get hurt and he won't be able to provide health insurance to pay those bills.	1
ClaimBuster	10009				So more trade but on fair terms -- and favor investment in America.	0
ClaimBuster	10010				Well, I think one thing that distinguishes is experience.	0
ClaimBuster	10011				What I am trying to indicate is that the tide of history's on our side, and that we can keep it on our side, because we're on the right side.	0
ClaimBuster	10012				One is by ex- the programs such as aid to education.	0
ClaimBuster	10013				What your plan does is to duplicate what's already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can't deny you if you've -- if it's been under 90 days.	1
ClaimBuster	10014				No, Mr. Kraft, we're spending very significant amounts of money now, some $200 billion a year, almost 50 percent of our total federal expenditure uh - by the federal government at the present time for human needs.	1
ClaimBuster	10015				I said it was a mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	10016				When we compare these two records in the areas that Senator Kennedy has - has discussed tonight, I think we find that America has been moving ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	10017				Five cents a day - that's what the food package averages per person.	1
ClaimBuster	10018				So that would be priority number one.	0
ClaimBuster	10019				Mr. Greenberg, I think my opponent in this debate tonight is overlooking one other very important fact.	0
ClaimBuster	10020				America is not temporary; we're forever.	0
ClaimBuster	10021				They put in $30 thousand of their own money and got a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in tax savings.	1
ClaimBuster	10022				I would like our farmers feeding the world.	0
ClaimBuster	10023				That is the part that requires employers to determine the citizenship of an employee before they're hired.	1
ClaimBuster	10024				I just think I can do that far more effectively, because the most important weapon in doing that is intelligence.	0
ClaimBuster	10025				We've got to reform health care to help you and your budget.	0
ClaimBuster	10026				"And now, five weeks before the election, he's saying that his big, bold idea is, ""Never mind."""	1
ClaimBuster	10027				And I think I got a good plan to help fix those problems at home.	0
ClaimBuster	10028				"But in the case of missile defense, Senator Obama said it had to be, quote, ""proven."""	1
ClaimBuster	10029				That's one of the centerpieces of his campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	10030				There are a number of things that sound good, but frankly, we just can't afford them.	0
ClaimBuster	10031				And we handled it responsibly and I think Captain Miller's testimony to that effect is the best evidence.	0
ClaimBuster	10032				Mr. Reagan, after the election, is going to have to propose a tax increase, and you will have to compare what he proposes.	0
ClaimBuster	10033				A deep commitment to making welfare reform work with incentives to the private sector to move people from welfare to work.	0
ClaimBuster	10034				I will hunt them down, and we'll kill them, we'll capture them.	0
ClaimBuster	10035				He favors this supply maintenance or production controls.	0
ClaimBuster	10036				We knew he'd been -- invaded other countries.	1
ClaimBuster	10037				If I say yes, then that means that we're reigniting the old Cold War.	0
ClaimBuster	10038				Well, Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why I suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up.	1
ClaimBuster	10039				Uh - I might make a correction uh - of what uh - Governor Carter said, uh speaking of uh - uh - gun control, uh - yes, it is true, I believe that the sale of uh - Saturday Night S- Specials should be cut out, but he wants the registration of handguns.	1
ClaimBuster	10040				But he and Mr. Kissinger and others tried to start a new Vietnam in Angola, and it was only the outcry of the American people and the Congress when their secret deal was discovered that prevented our involvement in that conflagration which was taking place there.	1
ClaimBuster	10041				Let me go back to Texas, for example, for a minute.	0
ClaimBuster	10042				But what is the advantage in a low income area of sending a child to a failed school and that being your only choice?	0
ClaimBuster	10043				Vaccine manufacturers are worried about getting sued, and therefore they have backed off from providing this kind of vaccine.	1
ClaimBuster	10044				Join me in the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place.	0
ClaimBuster	10045				I believe what you need to do is some of what Ross is talking about: control the growth of mandatory spending and get taxes down.	0
ClaimBuster	10046				Keep in mind a factory worker has nothing to do with anything except putting it together on the factory floor.	1
ClaimBuster	10047				But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers' salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee.	0
ClaimBuster	10048				Their idea was to have the poorest seniors in the country pay $270 more this year.	1
ClaimBuster	10049				It was under our administration that Mrs. Aquino came in.	1
ClaimBuster	10050				I think one of the problems today with the cities is Federal aid.	0
ClaimBuster	10051				It's the challenges that you don't that end up consuming most of your time.	0
ClaimBuster	10052				And that's exactly what I did.	1
ClaimBuster	10053				That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.	1
ClaimBuster	10054				It's far better for a person sitting in the White House uh - who has a number of options to make certain that the uh - other side, so to speak, doesn't know precisely what you're going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	10055				And the reason Pakistan -- the popular opinion of America had diminished in Pakistan was because we were supporting a dictator, Musharraf, had given him $10 billion over seven years, and he had suspended civil liberties.	1
ClaimBuster	10056				I talk to Silvio Berlusconi.	1
ClaimBuster	10057				I suppose it was hoped when he made that speech that we wouldn't get into a war.	0
ClaimBuster	10058				We have 17 -- 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election.	1
ClaimBuster	10059				I work every day with people.	1
ClaimBuster	10060				I see mothers holding their babies up, so that they can see a man who might be president of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	10061				And I've gotten good people, like former Secretary of the Treasury Bob Rubin, for instance, who showed how to balance budgets and give you a good economy, to help me crunch these numbers and make them work.	1
ClaimBuster	10062				But they lead in very different directions.	0
ClaimBuster	10063				I've called for a 25% reduction in congressional staffs and expenditures.	1
ClaimBuster	10064				In his last litany of misstatements.	0
ClaimBuster	10065				As a matter of fact, I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mr. Mondale's running mate said I wasn't a good Christian.	1
ClaimBuster	10066				I'd rather answer her question first and then I'll be glad to.	0
ClaimBuster	10067				The best poverty program is a job with dignity in the private sector.	0
ClaimBuster	10068				Governor Thompson of Illinois did.	1
ClaimBuster	10069				We'll give you all the equipment you need.	0
ClaimBuster	10070				So let me get to that.	0
ClaimBuster	10071				Now, forget all this talk about a draft.	0
ClaimBuster	10072				School choice -- public, private or religious.	0
ClaimBuster	10073				But I do believe that no one in this country should be denied the right to express themselves, or to even try to persuade others to follow their leader.	0
ClaimBuster	10074				We have a very different outlook.	0
ClaimBuster	10075				That's why I will never stop at anything to hunt down and kill the terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	10076				They create warheads, and we can't.	1
ClaimBuster	10077				Secondly, we need an active exploration program in America.	0
ClaimBuster	10078				We're not going to have a draft, period.	0
ClaimBuster	10079				My attitude is you take preemptive action in order to protect the American people, that you act in order to make this country secure.	0
ClaimBuster	10080				We have to remember, when we talk a tax cut, we're only talking about reducing a tax increase, because this Administration has left us with a built-in tax increase that will amount to $86 billion next year.	1
ClaimBuster	10081				The mission is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	10082				And so the best indication about when we can bring our troops home -- which I really want to do, but I don't want to do so for the sake of bringing them home; I want to do so because we've achieved an objective -- is to see the Iraqis perform and to see the Iraqis step up and take responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	10083				That's the most noble thing that anybody can do.	0
ClaimBuster	10084				We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	10085				Because he will not withdraw, because he's committed to these islands, because we've been unable to persuade him to withdraw, we are in a very difficult position.	0
ClaimBuster	10086				Now, my defense secretary is going to have a lot to do with those decisions, but it's going to be the President who's going to have to ultimately decide before that budget goes to the Congress what weapons systems are going to go and what are going to stay.	0
ClaimBuster	10087				Governor Carter again is talking in broad generalities.	1
ClaimBuster	10088				Mr. Carter had also promised that he would not use unemployment as a tool to fight against inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	10089				So seventy percent of our debt is five years or less.	1
ClaimBuster	10090				They may - are not my style.	0
ClaimBuster	10091				My friends, what we have to do with Medicare is have a commission, have the smartest people in America come together, come up with recommendations, and then, like the base-closing commission idea we had, then we should have Congress vote up or down.	0
ClaimBuster	10092				I don't know how you can govern in this country when you look at New York City and you see that 50 percent of the black males there are unemployed, when you see 40 percent of Hispanic children -- of black children in some cities -- dropping out of high school.	1
ClaimBuster	10093				That is what I have tried to do successfully by keeping our country at peace.	0
ClaimBuster	10094				And why do I want to bring rates down, and at the same time lower exemptions and deductions, particularly for people at the high end?	0
ClaimBuster	10095				And it's all covered in my budget from -- the plans that I've laid out -- from raising taxes on families with incomes above $200,000 and asking foreign corporations to pay the same tax that American corporations do on the same income, from $140 billion in budget cuts, including what I think are very prudent cuts in the defense budget.	1
ClaimBuster	10096				And that is because they wanted to choose the school that they thought was best for their children.	0
ClaimBuster	10097				Instead of ballooning the debt and multiplying it four times over, we have seen the debt actually begun to be paid down.	1
ClaimBuster	10098				Thank you, Mr. President, also for being part of this -- this debate.	0
ClaimBuster	10099				That's what a president does.	0
ClaimBuster	10100				Let me talk about North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	10101				Two weeks ago, there was a meeting of the North Atlantic Council, which is the political arm of NATO.	1
ClaimBuster	10102				I will tell you this.	0
ClaimBuster	10103				Now, I like green energy as well, but that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and gas receives.	1
ClaimBuster	10104				Whether it be the establishment of the 9/11 Commission.	0
ClaimBuster	10105				So I want to tell you, we will run a truthful campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	10106				I think it ought to be a top priority.	0
ClaimBuster	10107				Energy we have to deal with today, because you're paying $3.80 here in Nashville for gasoline, and it could go up.	1
ClaimBuster	10108				And there ought to be a consequence when you do carry a gun into a school.	0
ClaimBuster	10109				So I, we're going to do better, and we'll do better still, but this is a commitment I think that all Americans share without regard to party.	0
ClaimBuster	10110				They want to get our edge back in science, and they want a policy headed by the President that helps close this gap that's widening between the United States and Europe and Japan.	0
ClaimBuster	10111				The president hasn't put one nickel, not one nickel into the effort to fix some of our tunnels and bridges and most exposed subway systems.	1
ClaimBuster	10112				Who's the person who has believed that the best thing for America is -- is to have a tax system that is fundamentally fair?	0
ClaimBuster	10113				Bob, I think it's going to be important to just -- I'll respond to these two particular allegations that Senator McCain has made and that have gotten a lot of attention.	0
ClaimBuster	10114				And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.	0
ClaimBuster	10115				Let's take 300 of that billion and go in and buy those home loan mortgages and negotiate with those people in their homes, 11 million homes or more, so that they can afford to pay the mortgage, stay in their home.	0
ClaimBuster	10116				First of all, I accept President Reagan's affirmation of faith.	0
ClaimBuster	10117				I don't think he has to be a dictator.	0
ClaimBuster	10118				And that's about all I can say in a minute.	0
ClaimBuster	10119				And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have.	0
ClaimBuster	10120				The financial system had frozen up.	1
ClaimBuster	10121				Now look, he says Arkansas's a poor state.	1
ClaimBuster	10122				And that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy, because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things that are helping America grow.	0
ClaimBuster	10123				But that can't hide the fact that there are eight million men and women out of work in America today, and two million of those lost their jobs in just the last few months.	1
ClaimBuster	10124				Jim, let me just make a point.	0
ClaimBuster	10125				And I think that perhaps we established a little better understanding.	0
ClaimBuster	10126				My request for this year was $4.9 billion for AIDS -- ten times as much per AIDS victim as per cancer victim.	1
ClaimBuster	10127				When I make a mistake I say I'm sorry.	1
ClaimBuster	10128				We've got declining crime rates, two million fewer people on welfare rolls before welfare reform passed, and a 50 percent increase in child support and a crime bill with 60 death penalties and 100,000 police and the assault weapons ban.	1
ClaimBuster	10129				Well, first of all, I think the first answer this evening suggests exactly what I'm saying.	0
ClaimBuster	10130				In the 1980s, I was working to reform the schools in Arkansas.	1
ClaimBuster	10131				I will balance the budget every year.	0
ClaimBuster	10132				Mr. Nixon comes out of the Republican party.	1
ClaimBuster	10133				Senator McCain mentioned looking at our records.	1
ClaimBuster	10134				Senator McCain, as recently as March, bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator.	1
ClaimBuster	10135				Because when you measure you can ask the question, do they know?	0
ClaimBuster	10136				She knows how to create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	10137				Some of the things that can be done about this is a change in the rate structure of electric power companies.	0
ClaimBuster	10138				Governor Romney says, we should replace it, I'm just going to repeal it, but -- but we can replace it with something.	1
ClaimBuster	10139				Listen, we'll do everything we can to protect the homeland.	0
ClaimBuster	10140				First of all, the sequester is not something that I've proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	10141				And I think we have a lot of earning back to do.	0
ClaimBuster	10142				We look to Europe uh - to Asia because the struggle is in the underdeveloped world.	0
ClaimBuster	10143				I don't want the talents of any American to go to waste.	0
ClaimBuster	10144				Recognize the legitimacy of those kids that were carrying the Statue of Liberty.	0
ClaimBuster	10145				They pulled out of the nonproliferation agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	10146				I maybe need to get a new accountant.	0
ClaimBuster	10147				Loves his family, cares about his faith.	0
ClaimBuster	10148				I think a great many of them have come out today.	0
ClaimBuster	10149				Indeed, he was on that side virtually throughout all his years in the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	10150				No -- in fact, watching shows, they're reading the papers.	0
ClaimBuster	10151				So I want to do something about that.	0
ClaimBuster	10152				We eliminated two hundred and seventy-eight of them.	1
ClaimBuster	10153				But just tell me now; don't bury until after the election twice.	0
ClaimBuster	10154				It's a question of priorities and values.	0
ClaimBuster	10155				I made some mistakes in appointing people, but I'm not going to name them.	0
ClaimBuster	10156				I would be willing to have another debate this year.	0
ClaimBuster	10157				I've been -- but I'll nevertheless tell you that I think he has not been candid with the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	10158				You look at the poor people who still live in Cuba.	0
ClaimBuster	10159				But with respect to China, China is both an adversary, but also a potential partner in the international community if it's following the rules.	0
ClaimBuster	10160				I think I know the - the uh capabilities and limitations of atomic power.	0
ClaimBuster	10161				But if you take it in numbers of dollars instead of percentage, yes, you could say, well, that person got 10 times as much as this other person.	1
ClaimBuster	10162				I think the matter is settled once and for all.	0
ClaimBuster	10163				And I can see why you feel that cynicism and mistrust, because the system in Washington is broken.	0
ClaimBuster	10164				China's been cheating over the years.	1
ClaimBuster	10165				About two percent of our population of white people are - is illiterate, ten per cent of our colored population.	1
ClaimBuster	10166				Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS?	0
ClaimBuster	10167				Here is one place where I think that our program does a better job than his.	0
ClaimBuster	10168				I said before, watch Ukraine.	1
ClaimBuster	10169				You know, my father came from Kenya.	1
ClaimBuster	10170				That's not in my value system, and certainly not so that the wealthiest people in America can walk away with another tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	10171				And yet this man, the governor, equated the President to a rotting fish.	0
ClaimBuster	10172				I do not suggest that Chiang Kai-shek - and this Administration has been attempting since 1955 to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to lessen his troop commitments.	0
ClaimBuster	10173				Those terrorists had been violating their northern border consistently, and Israel chased them all the way to there.	1
ClaimBuster	10174				We also have capital gains now for people that invest in new small businesses and hold the investment for five years.	1
ClaimBuster	10175				That's the point I made.	0
ClaimBuster	10176				So this is a show me state.	0
ClaimBuster	10177				And I am not at all convinced that he was that far out of line with his people or that they wanted that to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	10178				She is -- she took on a governor who was a member of her own party when she ran for governor.	1
ClaimBuster	10179				We never would have got there if we had gone for the nuclear freeze crowd; we never would have got there if we had listened to those that wanted to cut defense spending.	0
ClaimBuster	10180				They're much better protected today than they were when I was the governor of Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	10181				That's something that the next treasury secretary is going to have to work on.	0
ClaimBuster	10182				Well, first of all, you know, he made that remark about Senator D'Amato.	1
ClaimBuster	10183				And good management in preserving the peace requires that we control the events and try to intercept before they become a crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	10184				And we have General Flynn.	1
ClaimBuster	10185				That's why Senator Hagel, Republican, says, you know: beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing, in the zone of dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	10186				We shouldn't be doing any favors for North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	10187				And so we're going to have to remain helpful in encouraging Pakistan to move towards a more stable government and rebuild the relationship with us.	0
ClaimBuster	10188				I think that has to be a part of a candidate for president or being president.	0
ClaimBuster	10189				"And ironically, if you repeal Obamacare, and I have become fond of this term, ""Obamacare,"" if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care."	1
ClaimBuster	10190				That's why we've got to make sure that we've got the best science and research in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	10191				I have kept the faith.	0
ClaimBuster	10192				The world is changing dramatically in how we work and how we live, how we relate to each other, huge changes.	0
ClaimBuster	10193				And in so doing, at the same time, we built a new breed of human called an American - a proud, an independent., and a most compassionate individual, for the most part.	0
ClaimBuster	10194				For those of you making up your mind, I would be honored to have your support.	0
ClaimBuster	10195				Now, as far as my position then is concerned, it is exactly opposite to the Senator's.	0
ClaimBuster	10196				And FEMA has been a major flagship project of our reinventing government efforts.	1
ClaimBuster	10197				Warren Buffett took a massive deduction.	1
ClaimBuster	10198				But we also want our education to be free of federal control.	0
ClaimBuster	10199				And that's why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button.	1
ClaimBuster	10200				Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.	1
ClaimBuster	10201				I think if we act effectively, if we stabilize the housing market -- which I believe we can, if we go out and buy up these bad loans, so that people can have a new mortgage at the new value of their home -- I think if we get rid of the cronyism and special interest influence in Washington so we can act more effectively.	0
ClaimBuster	10202				We have a delicate, tight-wire walk that we must go through at the present time to make sure that we do not cozy up to tyrants, to make sure that they don't get the impression that they can suppress their people.	0
ClaimBuster	10203				Well, again, I'm running on the record.	0
ClaimBuster	10204				Her tax plan is a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	10205				So we just have a different theory.	0
ClaimBuster	10206				You'll help prevent unwanted children, unwanted pregnancies.	0
ClaimBuster	10207				Did our administration push for the total training of Iraq?	0
ClaimBuster	10208				You were promised that Medicare would be reformed, and that Social Security would be reformed.	1
ClaimBuster	10209				And I would agree that integrity is not a Republican or a Democratic issue; it's an American issue.	0
ClaimBuster	10210				Nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	10211				Secondly, he said -- my opponent said where he worked to put sanctions on Iran -- we've already sanctioned Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	10212				But I believe that my plan is better than Senator Dole's ill-advised $550 billion scheme which I'll say again will blow a hole in the deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	10213				There isn't any doubt about that, number one.	0
ClaimBuster	10214				We are killing -- absolutely killing our energy business in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	10215				In Northern Ireland, in the Middle East we are better off than we were four years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	10216				Those listening to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	10217				I believe we ought to have foreign aid, but I don't think we ought to just have foreign aid for the sake of foreign aid.	0
ClaimBuster	10218				The governor will not put Medicare in a lockbox.	0
ClaimBuster	10219				And an economy with 7.8 percent unemployment is not a real strong economy.	0
ClaimBuster	10220				Despite all that, I was able to go to the best schools on earth and I was able to succeed in a way that I could not have succeeded anywhere else in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	10221				First of all, he made the misjudgment of saying to America that he was going to build a true alliance, that he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through the inspections.	1
ClaimBuster	10222				But the important -- I'd like to tell you, two Fourths of July ago I was in Baghdad.	1
ClaimBuster	10223				But there's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms.	0
ClaimBuster	10224				The American people want this environment protected.	0
ClaimBuster	10225				And that's hopeful, and that's positive.	0
ClaimBuster	10226				We're beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	10227				And we don't have enough troops there.	0
ClaimBuster	10228				Right this very minute we're sending supplies in to help these little starving kids in Somalia.	1
ClaimBuster	10229				And hard-pressed states right now can't all do that.	0
ClaimBuster	10230				It also is with respect to women, it's with respect to other efforts to try to reach out and be inclusive in our country.	0
ClaimBuster	10231				And there's no question but that Obamacare has been an extraordinary deterrent to enterprises of all kinds hiring people.	0
ClaimBuster	10232				And as president, I am committed to changing that.	0
ClaimBuster	10233				"There's a great passage of the Bible that says, ""What does it mean, my brother, to say you have faith if there are no deeds?"	1
ClaimBuster	10234				But to try, as occurred in the case that you mentioned - that specific case - to try to tell the parishioners of any church, of any denomination, how they should vote, or for whom they should vote, I think violates the principle of separation of church and state.	0
ClaimBuster	10235				Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that's really what's going to be -- that will happen.	0
ClaimBuster	10236				But because the leadership of this government did not pursue wise policies, we have been humiliated, and our opponents are stronger.	0
ClaimBuster	10237				We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	10238				I think I should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website.	0
ClaimBuster	10239				And now the federal government has become the world's greatest slum landlord.	0
ClaimBuster	10240				And we've put unprecedented trade pressure on China.	0
ClaimBuster	10241				But there are a lot of parents who feel like everything is going well in their child's school, and all of a sudden they wake up and realize that wait a minute, standards aren't being met.	0
ClaimBuster	10242				I've been talking about getting a capital gains cut forever, and his friends in Congress have been telling me that's a tax break for the rich.	0
ClaimBuster	10243				I'm not looking at anything now.	1
ClaimBuster	10244				Mr. Herter has said these islands are indefensible.	1
ClaimBuster	10245				We received the support first of the Administration and then not, and we were defeated by one vote in the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	10246				The bill finally came out at the end of the 1999 session.	1
ClaimBuster	10247				They were completely beyond the pale of the law, and I signed the Helms-Burton legislation.	1
ClaimBuster	10248				Mr. Mondale, could I ask you to address the question of nuclear strategy then?	0
ClaimBuster	10249				I didn't in the first debate, and I'm going to try not to in this debate, because I'd like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.	0
ClaimBuster	10250				I think I'm right because I believe that we must have a consistent foreign policy, a strong America, and a strong economy.	0
ClaimBuster	10251				And I do have a sad note tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	10252				And if Israel is attacked, America will stand with Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	10253				One's got a good job, one's studying to be a doctor.	0
ClaimBuster	10254				The next president of the United States is not going to have to address the issue as to whether we went into Iraq or not.	0
ClaimBuster	10255				He says he's learned how to match unemployment with inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	10256				As a matter of fact, I believe every one of those standards is essential to the exercise of power by this country.	0
ClaimBuster	10257				Both parties have foreign lobbyists on leaves in key roles in their campaigns.	1
ClaimBuster	10258				A lot of people ought to deserve credit, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	10259				I want to be the commander in chief of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	10260				When they don't pay their taxes, the average American pays the taxes for them.	0
ClaimBuster	10261				We've got the highest inflation we've had in twenty-five years right now, except under this administration, and that was fifty years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	10262				There is a ravenous demand for them overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	10263				Let me remind you it was a Democratic tax increase, and I didn't want to do it and I went along with it.	1
ClaimBuster	10264				And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama.	1
ClaimBuster	10265				Lloyd Bentsen and I are optimists, and so are the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	10266				And the CBO said -- that's the Congressional Budget Office; it's bipartisan -- they said that there would have to be a cut in benefits of 25 percent to 40 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	10267				I know you talked about it on the Jim, with Jim Lehrer on the PBS show.	1
ClaimBuster	10268				The bottom line is, we went in there alone.	1
ClaimBuster	10269				I think also what you need to think about is not the immediate, but what about Medicare?	0
ClaimBuster	10270				We have a commission on campaign finance reform.	1
ClaimBuster	10271				I believe the way to get the deficit down is to control the growth of mandatory spending programs, and not raise taxes on the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	10272				So long as people have input.	0
ClaimBuster	10273				Values begin at the top, in the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	10274				But I have also worked hard to give people a chance to prove that they are qualified.	0
ClaimBuster	10275				In uh - January of 1975 he asked for a tax change: a $5.6 billion increase on low-and-middle-income private individuals, a six and a half billion dollar decrease on the corporations and the special interests.	1
ClaimBuster	10276				Senator Dole led the opposition to it.	1
ClaimBuster	10277				And I don't see any improvement in the performance of the Congress under the present leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	10278				And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.	1
ClaimBuster	10279				It's going to cost more money, and growth will help us to win that battle.	0
ClaimBuster	10280				There is no way of anticipating what may happen.	0
ClaimBuster	10281				I went into the Olympics that was out of balance, and we got it on balance, and made a success there.	1
ClaimBuster	10282				I want you to hear a problem we√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ve got here in the USA.	0
ClaimBuster	10283				I am concerned about what that does to our future.	0
ClaimBuster	10284				People didn't want to touch it for fear of getting hurt politically.	0
ClaimBuster	10285				The net result is this administration, and during my time as the president for the next four years, we will continue to move for normalization of relations in the traditional sense, and we will insist that the disputes between Taiwan and the People's Republic be settled peacefully, as was agreed in the Shanghai Communique, of 1972.	0
ClaimBuster	10286				A President must not only assure that we're tough, but we must also be wise and smart in the exercise of that power.	0
ClaimBuster	10287				That's the discipline we need, and I'm working for that -- to protect the American taxpayer against the big spenders.	1
ClaimBuster	10288				And the average citizen out here is just working hard every day.	0
ClaimBuster	10289				Now, my balanced budget plan adds ten years to the life of the Medicare trust fund, ten years.	1
ClaimBuster	10290				As president of the United States, I want to assure you, I've got a pen.	0
ClaimBuster	10291				But I could give you a list of banks, I would -- if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks.	0
ClaimBuster	10292				But it has fallen from the -- from any standpoint.	0
ClaimBuster	10293				I believe it does meet the test.	0
ClaimBuster	10294				I want to use a scalpel so that people who need help are getting help and those of us, like myself and Senator McCain, who don't need help, aren't getting it.	0
ClaimBuster	10295				Well of course they add up.	0
ClaimBuster	10296				All over this country, they cannot even buy medicine.	0
ClaimBuster	10297				Now, I voted the way I voted because I saw that he had the policy wrong and I wanted accountability.	0
ClaimBuster	10298				Where we don't have very much money at the Federal level to spend on education, we ought to spend it helping the 90 percent of the kids that we can help.	0
ClaimBuster	10299				Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I've laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.	1
ClaimBuster	10300				I don't want to use food as a diplomatic weapon from this point forward.	0
ClaimBuster	10301				But this is a way to make sure people are actually involved with the decision-making process on health care.	1
ClaimBuster	10302				"Mr. Lodge, on ""Meet the Press"" a month ago, said if there was ever a case when we did not have law an our side it was in the U-2 incident."	1
ClaimBuster	10303				And so I would say that in all of these proposals Senator Kennedy has made, they will result in one of two things: either he has to raise taxes or he has to unbalance the budget.	0
ClaimBuster	10304				But I do think there are flexible ways to solve some of the pressing problems, particularly that affect our children.	0
ClaimBuster	10305				In 1980, President Reagan called you a liberal for voting for Federal gun control.	1
ClaimBuster	10306				But if you're a younger worker, if you're younger, you better hope this country thinks differently, otherwise you're gonna be faced with huge payroll taxes or reduced benefits.	0
ClaimBuster	10307				The Patriot Act is vital, by the way.	0
ClaimBuster	10308				There was a right way to disarm him and a wrong way.	0
ClaimBuster	10309				We cannot be strong militarily when we're teeter-tottering on top of a mountain of debt which has been created in the past eight years.	0
ClaimBuster	10310				Of course we're after Saddam Hussein -- I mean bin Laden.	1
ClaimBuster	10311				The time -- the time...	0
ClaimBuster	10312				But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	10313				Look at the INF treaty.	0
ClaimBuster	10314				I think the Wall Street Journal uh reported not too long ago they have a hundred and twelve public relations experts working for the Federal Energy Agency to try to justify to the American people its own existence.	1
ClaimBuster	10315				Now, we've got to make sure that we do it in a smart way and a comprehensive way, and we make the legal system better.	0
ClaimBuster	10316				They say, what do we need this for?	0
ClaimBuster	10317				But I think that now is the time to heal our country after the Vietnam War and I think that what the people are concerned about is not the - uh pardon or the amnesty of uh - those who evaded the draft, but - but whether or not our crime system is - is fair.	0
ClaimBuster	10318				Then his budget that he passed along with Speaker Gingrich cut Medicare $270 billion, more than was necessary to repair the Medicare trust fund.	1
ClaimBuster	10319				I've known him for 35 years.	1
ClaimBuster	10320				Number two, let's look at history.	0
ClaimBuster	10321				It's not an accurate one.	0
ClaimBuster	10322				And I embarked on an effort to resolve the POW-MIA issue, which we did in a bipartisan fashion, and then I worked on normalization of relations between our two countries so that our veterans could come all the way home.	1
ClaimBuster	10323				People tell me that when the health-care field is fully integrated with information technology, it'll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system.	0
ClaimBuster	10324				He's been the head of the Committee on Government Contracts that's carried out two cases, both in the District of Columbia.	1
ClaimBuster	10325				This is uh - not compatible with the purpose of our nation.	0
ClaimBuster	10326				The road to war is always paved with good intentions.	0
ClaimBuster	10327				Are we doing better in anti-terrorism?	0
ClaimBuster	10328				Let me talk about tax cuts one more time.	0
ClaimBuster	10329				They're not going to follow somebody whose core convictions keep changing because of politics in America.	0
ClaimBuster	10330				We have to decline, for the first time in modern history, jurisdiction in the World Court because they'll find us guilty of illegal actions.	0
ClaimBuster	10331				We're not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don't make our product anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	10332				A lot of these election-year conversions, the President talks about the drug money, and all the other things, all this antismoking campaign all happened in 1996.	1
ClaimBuster	10333				Anybody that says America has been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling in America.	0
ClaimBuster	10334				I haven't heard a big difference in the last few exchanges.	0
ClaimBuster	10335				Maybe we can work that out.	0
ClaimBuster	10336				Uh - I began campaigning uh - twenty-two months ago.	1
ClaimBuster	10337				We passed two very forward-looking civil rights bills.	1
ClaimBuster	10338				You have ancient ethnic rivalries that have cropped up as Yugoslavia's dissolved or getting dissolved, and it isn't going to be solved by sending in the 82nd Airborne, and I'm not going to do that as commander-in-chief.	0
ClaimBuster	10339				I've had a record of bringing people from all walks of life into my administration, and my administration is better off for it in Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	10340				I believe we ought to make the system work better.	0
ClaimBuster	10341				Oh, yeah, they're making -- I mean, they are outsmarting -- look, you're not there, you might be involved in that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	10342				You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami.	0
ClaimBuster	10343				Well, Theresa (ph), thank you.	0
ClaimBuster	10344				And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want.	0
ClaimBuster	10345				Ultimately, we're going to have to make some decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	10346				And the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies.	0
ClaimBuster	10347				It's because I care about education for all of our kids.	0
ClaimBuster	10348				The middle-class has been crushed over the last four years, and jobs have been too scarce.	1
ClaimBuster	10349				And that's something I want to lead, something we haven't had over the course of the past many years, even though the Vice President has been at least allegedly in charge of that war.	0
ClaimBuster	10350				Believe me, he's not a happy camper.	0
ClaimBuster	10351				I think that one of the problems that we have faced in the world is that we are so much more powerful than any single nation has been in relationship to the rest of the world than at any time in history, that I know about, anyway.	0
ClaimBuster	10352				So the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs.	0
ClaimBuster	10353				If you are part of the -- of the bottom 20% or so of wage earners, then you will get an expanded earned income tax credit.	1
ClaimBuster	10354				49th for women with health care, and 50th for families with health care.	1
ClaimBuster	10355				This goes to our survival.	0
ClaimBuster	10356				I think there ought to be parental notification laws.	0
ClaimBuster	10357				I will do more for African-Americans and Latinos than she can ever do in 10 lifetimes.	0
ClaimBuster	10358				I want to hold the line on taxes, and keep this the longest expansion in modern history going until everybody in America benefits.	0
ClaimBuster	10359				...I indicated that you failed to put in place a status...	1
ClaimBuster	10360				Well, this has been a tough campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	10361				And I consider that to be a very good trait.	0
ClaimBuster	10362				Well, where do you want me to begin?	0
ClaimBuster	10363				There's a lot of really good people working hard to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	10364				Well, Andrea, we've just had another example of why the Vice President's mathematics just don't add up.	0
ClaimBuster	10365				I want to change the character of the presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	10366				And we have to recognize that the way they've been behaving lately demands a sharp response from the international community and our allies.	0
ClaimBuster	10367				Abraham Lincoln was a great president of all the people; but he was selected by his party at a key time in history because his party stood for something.	0
ClaimBuster	10368				The president's path means 20 million people out of work struggling for a good job.	1
ClaimBuster	10369				Whether there was some misleading, or instead whether we just didn't know what happened, you have to ask yourself why didn't we know five days later when the ambassador to the United Nations went on TV to say that this was a demonstration.	0
ClaimBuster	10370				There were a number of things in there that weakened that bill.	0
ClaimBuster	10371				Actually what I've said, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	10372				But our country is innately very strong.	0
ClaimBuster	10373				It costs California taxpayers 3 billion dollars a year.	1
ClaimBuster	10374				Opening up more trade, particularly in Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	10375				Tonight, as Americans, you have a choice.	0
ClaimBuster	10376				And Mr. President, it's good to be with you again.	0
ClaimBuster	10377				And I think you get a certain arrogance, bureaucratic arrogance, if people stay there too long.	0
ClaimBuster	10378				I was in Houston on Tuesday meeting with a group of good citizens, working citizens.	1
ClaimBuster	10379				First, there's some who should be buying health care who choose not to.	0
ClaimBuster	10380				Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our allies.	0
ClaimBuster	10381				And the answer is I don't believe people think that's the case --	0
ClaimBuster	10382				But the Republican leadership of the House and Senate won't even let us have a vote on it.	0
ClaimBuster	10383				I've worked hard to create good jobs and to educate people.	0
ClaimBuster	10384				I've got an obligation to make sure our government does everything we can to protect you.	0
ClaimBuster	10385				He was nominated by it.	1
ClaimBuster	10386				And this idea of unleashing a whole bunch-an army, a conventional force army, of IRS agents into everybody's kitchen I mean, he's against most defense matters, and now he wants to get an army of JRS auditors going out there.	0
ClaimBuster	10387				I want to restore a meaningful safety net.	0
ClaimBuster	10388				Yes, I have seen figures that indicate that perhaps as of September, 1980 - this very month - that there is a shortage of about 104,000 in the ranks between E-4 and E-9.	1
ClaimBuster	10389				I know what it takes to bring them back, and I'm going to do that, and make sure that when you graduate -- when do you graduate?	0
ClaimBuster	10390				I have met with the legislative leaders.	1
ClaimBuster	10391				As a result, we have saved over $9 billion in federal expenditures.	1
ClaimBuster	10392				It's a tall order, but I've been running against the odds for a long time and, again, I'm honored to be here this evening.	0
ClaimBuster	10393				Well, here's the problem with it: It sounds very good, but there's a reason that 500 economists, including seven Nobel prize winners and business periodicals like Business Week, and even Senator Dole's friends, Senator Warren Rudman, former Republican senator from New Hampshire, says it's not a practical program.	1
ClaimBuster	10394				Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts.	1
ClaimBuster	10395				I've learned not to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	10396				And so I'll make the appeal on a wide array of issues.	0
ClaimBuster	10397				I think the reason to support the death penalty is because it saves other people's lives.	0
ClaimBuster	10398				It stripped us of manufacturing jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	10399				In Iraq, no doubt about it, it's tough.	0
ClaimBuster	10400				But now I think there have been a couple of instances where the Burger Court has made technical rulings where an obviously guilty person was later found to be guilty.	1
ClaimBuster	10401				Having a hemisphere that is free for trade and peaceful is in our nation's interests.	0
ClaimBuster	10402				We are not going to spend the billions and trillions that Mr. Bush wants to spend on Star Wars.	0
ClaimBuster	10403				There is very little difference in the budget that I proposed and the Republican budget over the next six-year period.	1
ClaimBuster	10404				I think as you make the case, the American people will increasingly come to our cause.	0
ClaimBuster	10405				We're backing up at every way we possibly can.	0
ClaimBuster	10406				We have done a lot more, and I hope we get a chance to talk about it.	0
ClaimBuster	10407				I want to get America's economy going again.	0
ClaimBuster	10408				I don't think it should be used as a piggy bank for other programs.	0
ClaimBuster	10409				I have a plan to lower the cost of health care for you.	0
ClaimBuster	10410				When FDR established Social Security, they didn't call them IOUs, they called it the full faith and credit of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	10411				And they cry when they see what's happened.	0
ClaimBuster	10412				Many people are coming to this country for economic reasons.	1
ClaimBuster	10413				They were just shuffling too many kids through the system, year after year, grade after grade, without learning the basics.	0
ClaimBuster	10414				That's not what we want.	0
ClaimBuster	10415				I simply think that when we are confronting a budget deficit this year - and this fiscal year will end in about 10 days, and we are confronted with the possibility of a deficit of $60 billion, perhaps as much as $63 billion - that that simply would be irresponsible.	1
ClaimBuster	10416				It has some very elderly leaders that will not be around too much longer.	0
ClaimBuster	10417				And I have a responsibility to correct him every time he misstates the case; and I intend to continue to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	10418				But as we respect someone's rights, and as we profess tolerance, we shouldn't change -- or have to change -- our basic views on the sanctity of marriage.	0
ClaimBuster	10419				I think the lessons of Iraq are very clear that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict.	0
ClaimBuster	10420				Donald wants to tear up our alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	10421				I believe that when we examine the Democratic platform, when we examine the proposals that he has discussed tonight, when we compare them with the proposals that I have made, that these proposals that he makes would not result in greater growth for this country than would be the case if we followed the programs that I have advocated.	0
ClaimBuster	10422				Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989.	0
ClaimBuster	10423				There's no way to get the answer to a question.	0
ClaimBuster	10424				If it ever becomes necessary, and is wise economically and essential to our security, I would have no hesitancy in suggesting a tax increase or any other policy which would defend the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	10425				No, but he's for weakening it.	0
ClaimBuster	10426				Or you can cut his allowance and achieve the same end much quicker.	0
ClaimBuster	10427				Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, he is the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said over his dead body before it gets renewed without being thoroughly rechecked.	1
ClaimBuster	10428				In a lot of places, our police are outgunned.	1
ClaimBuster	10429				I spent a lot of time talking to military families as well as military members all over the world and in bases all across the United States, and I became convinced after talking to the families and the personnel in uniform that we needed to not only have the pay raise but we needed to invest more in child care, housing, and other things to support families, especially when there are longer deployments because of the downsizing of the military.	1
ClaimBuster	10430				"Now, Governor Romney just said, you know he wants to help those young people too, but during the Republican primary, he said, ""I will veto the DREAM Act"", that would allow these young people to have access."""	1
ClaimBuster	10431				It would have been a wider war, which the United States of America might have had to come back.	0
ClaimBuster	10432				Already just today the members of his political party said that they were going to ignore the orders of the new president of Serbia, and that they question his legitimacy, and he's still going to try to be actively involved.	1
ClaimBuster	10433				I found it to be an issue in trying to defend my tax relief package.	0
ClaimBuster	10434				In fact, he first didn't even want to do that.	1
ClaimBuster	10435				You can see it in this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	10436				Let's not raise anybody's taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	10437				Uh - First of all, we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference.	0
ClaimBuster	10438				Child safety trigger locks on a mandatory basis, and others.	0
ClaimBuster	10439				You can't do it as president: you can't have a pattern of one side of the issue one day and another the next.	0
ClaimBuster	10440				Why have there been these safety violations?	0
ClaimBuster	10441				He says, √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬∞√Ç¬•Well, let's concede that the administration has been doing business with Noriega.	1
ClaimBuster	10442				Now, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work.	1
ClaimBuster	10443				We have no growth in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	10444				I believe we have to get ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	10445				And I say that because from the very beginning, the president in his campaign four years ago, said he would meet with all the world's worst actors in his first year, he'd sit down with Chavez and Kim Jong-il, with Castro and President Ahmadinejad of Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	10446				Well, thank you, Terry (ph).	0
ClaimBuster	10447				The Office of Small Business, under Mr. Kobelinski, has a very massive program trying to help the black community.	1
ClaimBuster	10448				I have advocated and taken on the special interests, whether they be the big money people by reaching across the aisle and working with Senator Feingold on campaign finance reform, whether it being a variety of other issues, working with Senator Lieberman on trying to address climate change.	1
ClaimBuster	10449				If I'm entrusted with the presidency, I will help parents and strengthen families because, you know, if we have prosperity that grows and grows, we still won't be successful unless we strengthen families by, for example, ensuring that children can always go to schools that are safe.	0
ClaimBuster	10450				But they'll tell you his prescription wasn't going to work.	0
ClaimBuster	10451				And I think it's important for us to make college affordable.	0
ClaimBuster	10452				It's a big human problem and a devastating economic problem for America, and I'm going to send a plan to do this within the first 100 days of my presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	10453				We're working right now in trying to be of help in southern Africa with regard to the independence of Namibia and the removal of the Cuban surrogates, the thousands of them, from Angola.	1
ClaimBuster	10454				I've argued that we should fully funded it.	1
ClaimBuster	10455				Minority ownership of businesses are up, because we created an environment for the entrepreneurial spirit to be strong.	1
ClaimBuster	10456				But I also believe that for far too long, certainly during the course of the Bush administration with the support of Senator McCain, the attitude has been that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	10457				And in conference -- we stayed with them in conference all the way to where even Senator Simpson did not want the bill in the manner in which it would come out of the conference committee.	1
ClaimBuster	10458				I've worked on that long and hard.	1
ClaimBuster	10459				So I believe that this election has become in part so -- so conflict-oriented, so intense because there's a lot at stake.	0
ClaimBuster	10460				Mr. Howe, Mr. Vice President.	0
ClaimBuster	10461				I'm going to be a president who believes in science.	0
ClaimBuster	10462				It will come from the pockets of the people who are living in those very areas.	0
ClaimBuster	10463				In February he said we had the best economy in √É‚Äö 30 years, just February.	1
ClaimBuster	10464				I am in favor of leaving the tax rates alone and reducing the tax burden on middle-income Americans by doubling your tax exemption for every child from $3,500 to $7,000.	0
ClaimBuster	10465				My friends, the last president to raise taxes during tough economic times was Herbert Hoover, and he practiced protectionism as well, which I'm sure we'll get to at some point.	1
ClaimBuster	10466				Now I think as far as Quemoy and Matsu are concerned, that the question is not these two little pieces of real estate - they are unimportant.	0
ClaimBuster	10467				We have a government that doesn't work.	0
ClaimBuster	10468				As I said earlier, they don't have any ideas.	0
ClaimBuster	10469				And on that basis and that basis alone, we make a decision on every issue.	0
ClaimBuster	10470				I intend to do the same thing if I'm elected president.	0
ClaimBuster	10471				That's why what I have put forward doesn't add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher-paying jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	10472				But we also have to develop clean energy technologies that will allow us to cut our exports in half by 2020.	0
ClaimBuster	10473				I think that afterschool money ought to be available for faith-based programs and charitable programs that exist because somebody has heard the call to love a neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself.	0
ClaimBuster	10474				We're not going to eliminate everybody who is mentally disturbed and we have got to make sure they don't get weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	10475				I won't, I never repeat what I've talked to the President about.	0
ClaimBuster	10476				There is a crime bill that, lamentably, was blocked from passage once again, mostly by Republicans in the US Senate, which would have addressed some of these problems.	1
ClaimBuster	10477				The Cold War is over.	1
ClaimBuster	10478				We used to -- you know, we have a goal there for minority set-aside programs, to try to encourage ownership in the country.	1
ClaimBuster	10479				And I believe the federal government must say that if you receive any money, any money from the federal government for disadvantaged children, for example, you must show us whether or not the children are learning.	0
ClaimBuster	10480				And I want to keep it alive in child care and in other entitlements.	0
ClaimBuster	10481				Not the one we've been on, not the one the president describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich.	0
ClaimBuster	10482				If you look at the cost of not keeping the peace in Europe, it would be exorbitant.	0
ClaimBuster	10483				That's why we need to be firm and resolved in bringing them to justice.	0
ClaimBuster	10484				What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote.	1
ClaimBuster	10485				Look, Governor Bush, you have attacked my character and credibility and I am not going to respond in kind.	0
ClaimBuster	10486				I think the contracting business in government can help.	0
ClaimBuster	10487				And that's exactly the kind of top-down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy that's striving for everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	10488				If wind, water or fire destroyed them, we built them again.	0
ClaimBuster	10489				Here we have our own secretary of state who has had to apologize to the world for the presentation he made to the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	10490				The Republican party has produced McKinley and Harding, Coolidge, Dewey, and Landon.	1
ClaimBuster	10491				The people, some way, have always understood that at a particular time a certain man was the one the country needed.	0
ClaimBuster	10492				We have a fundamental difference, approach on agriculture.	0
ClaimBuster	10493				So there's no doubt that we have a long way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	10494				So we've got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	10495				I don't have any foreign lobbyists on leave in my campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	10496				If he, that's what he said, he's not right about that.	1
ClaimBuster	10497				After all, when you amend the Constitution, state legislatures must participate in the ratification of the Constitution.	1
ClaimBuster	10498				I mean, we've got big economic problems, but we are not coming apart at the seams; we're ready for a recovery.	0
ClaimBuster	10499				I notice that his task force that is working for his future plans had some of their ideas revealed in The Wall Street Journal this week.	1
ClaimBuster	10500				If you vote the other way, you will be lucky to save it.	0
ClaimBuster	10501				Throughout my career in public service, I have fought for the working men and women of this country, middle-class families.	1
ClaimBuster	10502				And so that's what I will do.	0
ClaimBuster	10503				Now, the three things they try to say I've changed position on are the Patriot Act; I haven't.	1
ClaimBuster	10504				And, Tom, if -- if we're going to go back and forth, I then -- I'd like to have equal time to go -- to respond to...	0
ClaimBuster	10505				And we have maintained the sanctions.	1
ClaimBuster	10506				But there's also the issue of responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	10507				And that's very important to the economy, but I think we want to make certain.	0
ClaimBuster	10508				And the notion that we would sit with Ahmadinejad and not say anything while he's spewing his nonsense and his vile comments is ridiculous.	0
ClaimBuster	10509				The president said he was going to build a true coalition, exhaust the remedies of the U.N. and go to war as a last resort.	1
ClaimBuster	10510				What is needed is a study that I have proposed by a task force of experts to look into this entire problem as to how it can be reformed and made actuarially sound, but with the premise that no one presently dependent on Social Security is going to have the rug pulled out from under them and not get their check.	0
ClaimBuster	10511				The deficit is the result of excessive government spending.	1
ClaimBuster	10512				I hope that they put the troops on the ground so that we can withdraw our troops and focus our military on fighting and winning war.	0
ClaimBuster	10513				My plan would give students a dollar-for-dollar reduction for the cost of a typical community college tuition.	0
ClaimBuster	10514				So he would have been alive today.	0
ClaimBuster	10515				Attacking me is not talking about how we're going to deal with the challenges that exist in the Middle East, and take advantage of the opportunity there, and stem the tide of this violence.	0
ClaimBuster	10516				This is part of the choice in this election.	0
ClaimBuster	10517				I believe that we need to educate better and retrain better.	0
ClaimBuster	10518				The federal government has been reduced in size by more than 300,000 people.	1
ClaimBuster	10519				Are your children getting a better education.	0
ClaimBuster	10520				The president's got another proposal to require them to pay $400 a year more for the next 5 years.	1
ClaimBuster	10521				Sure, there's more work to do.	0
ClaimBuster	10522				Yes, we can be safe and secure, if we stay on the offense against the terrorists and if we spread freedom and liberty around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	10523				In the last month, we've had a net loss of one hundred and sixty-three thousand jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	10524				We've got 20 million names on a computer in Washington, D.C. of people who should not have guns.	1
ClaimBuster	10525				Yes, it was announced that the uh - GNP real growth in the third quarter was at 4 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	10526				"And when I hear Governor Romney say he's a big coal guy, I mean, keep in mind, when -- Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts, you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, ""This plant kills,"" and took great pride in shutting it down."	1
ClaimBuster	10527				But I suggest that we understand that those are going to be additional costs on senior citizens across this country.	0
ClaimBuster	10528				Those 209 Americans last Thursday night in Richmond told us they wanted us to stop talking about each other and start talking about Americans and their problems and their promise, and I think we ought to get back to that.	1
ClaimBuster	10529				I should point out that as far as depletion allowances are concerned, the oil depletion allowance is one that provides eighty percent of all of those involved in depletion, so you're not going to get much from revenue insofar as depletion allowances are concerned, unless you move in the area that he indicated.	1
ClaimBuster	10530				And that's a good thing.	0
ClaimBuster	10531				Let's make it a strength, not a weakness.	0
ClaimBuster	10532				Well, I mentioned Third World debt.	1
ClaimBuster	10533				We're in the serious stages of negotiation with the Soviet Union on the strategic arms control talks.	1
ClaimBuster	10534				If we're going to talk about trips that we've taken -- when I was a candidate for office, first trip I took was to visit our troops.	1
ClaimBuster	10535				One is we've got to have the money to be able to pay for defense, and we've got to manufacture here.	0
ClaimBuster	10536				Nuclear power is safe, and it's clean, and it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	10537				This is a tough campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	10538				Well, one of the very serious things that's happened in our government in recent years, and has continued up until now, is a breakdown in the trust among our people in the [twenty-seven-minute delay]	0
ClaimBuster	10539				Now, my plan for the future, I see a time when we have smaller, smarter government where you don't have to wait in line because you can get services online cheaper, better, faster.	0
ClaimBuster	10540				I am the one that said let's keep the M.F.N.	1
ClaimBuster	10541				"And you know, Senator McCain, I think the ""Straight Talk Express"" lost a wheel on that one."	0
ClaimBuster	10542				But Russia has to make the decision.	0
ClaimBuster	10543				"I can't begin to pay back my student loans."""	0
ClaimBuster	10544				I don't believe in the registration of handguns or the registration of the handgun owner.	0
ClaimBuster	10545				It's the toughest job on Earth, and you must master the facts and insist that things that must be done are done.	0
ClaimBuster	10546				Spending money is one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	10547				That's an area where we're going to have to work with Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	10548				I respect him for showing tonight - for appearing here, and I thank the League of Women Voters for the opportunity that they have given me.	0
ClaimBuster	10549				Let me call your attention to the key word there.	0
ClaimBuster	10550				Well, I definitely think there are differences.	0
ClaimBuster	10551				But nevertheless, they're out there.	0
ClaimBuster	10552				This nation is the most religious nation on Earth -- more people go to church and synagogues than any other nation on Earth -- and it's because we kept the politicians and the state out of the personal exercise of our faith.	1
ClaimBuster	10553				We'll never have a balanced budget, we'll never meet the needs of our people, we'll never control the inflationary spiral, as long as we have seven and a half or eight million people out of work, who are looking for jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	10554				But I don't -- I think you got to look at the integrity and the honor of the people that are being lobbied and those that are lobbyists.	0
ClaimBuster	10555				I think that's part of it.	0
ClaimBuster	10556				To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.	0
ClaimBuster	10557				But the point is, what about his error in voting for the amendment, which was not adopted, and then persisting in it in fifty-nine, persisting in it in the debate.	1
ClaimBuster	10558				And whether this House and Senate, in the next session is Democratic or Republican, if the country will have voted for the candidate for the presidency and for the proposals that he has made, I believe that you will find that the president, if it were a Republican, as it would be in my case, would be able to get his program through that Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	10559				I don't want the federal government paying teachers' salaries directly.	0
ClaimBuster	10560				And the idea that has been suggested that I would liquidate the industry, of course not.	0
ClaimBuster	10561				We don't know what the future's going to bring.	0
ClaimBuster	10562				He voted to violate the budget cap 277 times.	1
ClaimBuster	10563				And the birther lie was a very hurtful one.	0
ClaimBuster	10564				I just want to mention if I could --	0
ClaimBuster	10565				And we not only have uh problems at home but we export those problems overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	10566				I -- of course there's a lot -- look, global warming needs to be taken very seriously, and I take it seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	10567				When you are proud and confident of your strength, you do not get down to the level of Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues.	0
ClaimBuster	10568				And we have got to put our nation back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	10569				Ross, that's a great speech, but it's not quite that simple.	0
ClaimBuster	10570				This is just another lie.	0
ClaimBuster	10571				Japan is going to have a summit for the donors; $14 billion pledged.	1
ClaimBuster	10572				I sit down with the world leaders frequently and talk to them on the phone frequently.	1
ClaimBuster	10573				Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	10574				On a -- on the way that the Iraq War was conducted.	0
ClaimBuster	10575				What matters is something in this person's head says there is not going to be a consequence.	0
ClaimBuster	10576				Number two, we do have to deal with our border so we put more border patrol on the -- any time in history and the flow of undocumented works across the border is actually lower than it's been in 40 years.	1
ClaimBuster	10577				We'll be implementing a missile-defense system relatively quickly.	0
ClaimBuster	10578				We didn't go in until right before the election, similar to what was taking place in 1972, when Mr. Kissinger announced peace is at hand just before the election at that time.	1
ClaimBuster	10579				"We will go with our allies."""	0
ClaimBuster	10580				He's going to tax everybody here to fund his programs.	0
ClaimBuster	10581				Now, all these fellows with thousand-dollar suits and alligator shoes running up and down the halls of Congress that make policy now -- the lobbyists, the PAC guys, the foreign lobbyists, and what-have-you, they'll be over there in the Smithsonian, you know --	0
ClaimBuster	10582				And then we noticed that there was more than one with that same serial number.	1
ClaimBuster	10583				We have a disciplined reduction in the deficit of 50 % over the next 4 years, but first get incentives to invest in this economy, put the American people back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	10584				And, yes, he would have been stronger had we not dealt with him.	0
ClaimBuster	10585				And I do believe that we didn't gain a great deal in the Mideast by bringing three of the four leaders, one refused to come, to Washington D.C.	1
ClaimBuster	10586				By and large it should be local -- the more local, the better.	0
ClaimBuster	10587				The question is the means.	0
ClaimBuster	10588				You can check 10% of that if you want to, in the 1 box, and that 10%, $100, or if you're paying $10,000, whatever it is, $1000, check it off and make the government, make it lower the deficit by that amount.	1
ClaimBuster	10589				But he didn't put in what he promised, and that makes a difference in the lives of our children.	0
ClaimBuster	10590				Neither I nor anybody else, as far a I know, agreed to give him our proxy to say that whatever he did was fine for the workers of this country and for the interests of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	10591				But I do think we need to find out where racial profiling occurs and do something about it and say to the local folks, get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	10592				I am grateful for the chance to reaffirm my commitment to reduce nuclear weapons and, one day, to eliminate them entirely.	0
ClaimBuster	10593				The automobile industry is the number one market for steel.	1
ClaimBuster	10594				So it's not one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	10595				But I hope tonight you will get a better feel of who Bob Dole is and what he's all about.	0
ClaimBuster	10596				If you're a small business, it's a crushing burden.	0
ClaimBuster	10597				It's estimated that 8 million people will go from private insurance to government insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	10598				If you did that you could take away the incumbents' advantage because challengers like me would have a chance to run against incumbents like him for House races and Senate races, and then the voters could make up their own mind without being subject to an unfair fight.	0
ClaimBuster	10599				Every possible diplomatic means was utilized.	0
ClaimBuster	10600				So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly.	1
ClaimBuster	10601				I am -- you know it's really interesting.	0
ClaimBuster	10602				The reason Social Security -- he says it gets 2%.	1
ClaimBuster	10603				Amnesty means that - that you uh - that what you did was right.	0
ClaimBuster	10604				It -- when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that we've created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall?	0
ClaimBuster	10605				We need law and order, but we need justice, too.	0
ClaimBuster	10606				We can't stand pat for the reason that we're in a race, as I've indicated.	0
ClaimBuster	10607				For those of you for me, thanks for your help.	0
ClaimBuster	10608				It's $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public.	0
ClaimBuster	10609				I know exactly what we need to do in Iraq, and my position has been consistent: Saddam Hussein is a threat.	0
ClaimBuster	10610				Israel could not be blamed for that.	0
ClaimBuster	10611				I would say that the people now have the opportunity to evaluate his as against mine and I think both he and I are going to abide by whatever the people decide.	0
ClaimBuster	10612				The point of all this is, this is a struggle in which we're engaged.	0
ClaimBuster	10613				The thing I don't understand about Mr. Bush's approach to this is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do.	0
ClaimBuster	10614				The other day, I just - I'll hasten - I just saw one example.	0
ClaimBuster	10615				Well, I think there are many uh - tests, Mr. Drummond, of prestige.	0
ClaimBuster	10616				We should be playing the leadership role there, not on the ground with military.	0
ClaimBuster	10617				Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact...	0
ClaimBuster	10618				The Shanghai Communique, does say that the differences between the People's Republic on the one hand and Taiwan on the other shall be settled by peaceful means.	1
ClaimBuster	10619				And they are active in countries like -- in regions like Latin America, and Asia, and Africa.	1
ClaimBuster	10620				Well again, if you're somebody thinking about the future, I think it's fair to say that it'll be -- we'll work it out.	0
ClaimBuster	10621				I want to say, everything I ever learned about leadership I learned from a chief petty officer.	1
ClaimBuster	10622				But we have not had the kind of leadership we should have had.	0
ClaimBuster	10623				This is a president who hasn't met with the Black Congressional Caucus.	1
ClaimBuster	10624				And right now I have to tell you I don't think there is any excuse for the interest rates being as high as they are because we have brought inflation down so low.	0
ClaimBuster	10625				We've got five hundred thousand more Americans out of jobs today than were out of work three months ago and since Mr. Ford's been in office two years, we've had a 50 percent increase in unemployment from five million people out of work to two and a half million more people out of work and a total of seven and a half million.	1
ClaimBuster	10626				And we'll care for these young children.	0
ClaimBuster	10627				The best people in a small town will serve on the school board; you get into big cities, it's political patronage, stepping stones -- you get the job, give your relatives a janitor's job at $57,000 a year, more than the teachers make, and with luck they clean the cafeteria once a week.	0
ClaimBuster	10628				How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers?	0
ClaimBuster	10629				We can bridge the gap between imported oil, which is a national security issue, as well as any other, and it will reduce the price of a barrel of oil, because when people know there's a greater supply, then the cost of that will go down.	0
ClaimBuster	10630				I strongly believe we need to have a military presence in the Korean peninsula, not only to keep the peace in the peninsula, but to keep regional stability.	0
ClaimBuster	10631				That kind of thing is not the way to rein in runaway spending in Washington, D.C. That's one of the fundamental differences that Senator Obama and I have.	0
ClaimBuster	10632				The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	10633				And quite often this has been in the very poor people and neighborhoods in the downtown urban centers.	0
ClaimBuster	10634				And we have to vote it up or down, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	10635				I have not spent the last quarter century in pursuit of personal wealth.	1
ClaimBuster	10636				I believe we have to make the right and responsible choices.	0
ClaimBuster	10637				But why start an arms race now?	0
ClaimBuster	10638				Well the conditions I laid out in one of our previous television debates, and it's rather difficult to be much more specific than that.	1
ClaimBuster	10639				Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business.	1
ClaimBuster	10640				Listen, we've got gun laws.	1
ClaimBuster	10641				And the first word you need to say in every city and state, and just draw a line in the sand, is public schools exist for the benefit of the children.	0
ClaimBuster	10642				Although they have been moving faster in growth than we have, we find, for example, today that their total gross national product is only forty-four per cent of our total gross national product.	1
ClaimBuster	10643				There is no greater return to an economy or to a society than an educational system second to none.	0
ClaimBuster	10644				I mean, I sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street known as Trump...	1
ClaimBuster	10645				We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you.	0
ClaimBuster	10646				There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth.	0
ClaimBuster	10647				I take that very seriously, because I do think it's one of the issues we've got to come to grips with.	0
ClaimBuster	10648				We've got 100,000 trained now, 125,000 by the end of this year, 200,000 by the end of next year.	1
ClaimBuster	10649				And my whole concept was to make America great again.	0
ClaimBuster	10650				All of the problems -- the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border.	1
ClaimBuster	10651				I think it's fitting that we're on the campus of a university tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	10652				You've got 99 other senators to correct that mistake, if it is a mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	10653				I'd rather have some jobs left here than just see everything head south, see?	0
ClaimBuster	10654				It's got to be on the timetable of the people that we're trying to bring to the peace table.	0
ClaimBuster	10655				I spend a lot of time in hospitals.	1
ClaimBuster	10656				You know, one of the challenges over the last decade is we've done experiments in nation building in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and we've neglected, for example, developing our own economy, our own energy sectors, our own education system.	1
ClaimBuster	10657				Because you got a big tax increase.	1
ClaimBuster	10658				I want to build on our strengths.	0
ClaimBuster	10659				But it's bad, bad experience.	0
ClaimBuster	10660				And we will start putting together teams to put together--to take all the plans that exist and do something with them.	0
ClaimBuster	10661				We're not moving ahead in education the way we should.	0
ClaimBuster	10662				And so budgets reflect choices.	0
ClaimBuster	10663				I'm not going to, because I think that all of you -- or not everyone, those people that are in those pockets of poverty and haven't caught up, they couldn't answer the way I would want them to -- but I think that most of the people in this country would say, yes, they are better off than they were 4 years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	10664				Remember, there was a trillion dollars in debt before we got here.	1
ClaimBuster	10665				We had to go in there to get Osama bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	10666				I've been a hunter since I was a kid, 12, 13 years old.	1
ClaimBuster	10667				But the fact of it is we're so far away from research that even comes close to that, that the Director of Engineering Research at the Defense Department said to get there we would have to solve eight problems, each of which are more difficult than the atomic bomb and the Manhattan project.	1
ClaimBuster	10668				Now, I said earlier that we are the strongest military, but we need to continue improving readiness and making sure that our military personnel are adequately paid and that the combination of their pay and their benefits and their retirement as veterans is comparable to the stiff competition that's coming in this strong economy from the private sector.	1
ClaimBuster	10669				For every one of you who stood up here and asked a question tonight, I promise you there's a 100,000 Americans who said I wish I could have asked that question.	0
ClaimBuster	10670				We gave them $1.7 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	10671				This is the history of dealing with dictators.	0
ClaimBuster	10672				And there is this pattern that has plagued him in the primaries and now about trying to have it both ways on all these issues.	0
ClaimBuster	10673				We have to make health care affordable and available.	0
ClaimBuster	10674				And the mantle of leadership for the -- promoting the principles of peace has fallen to America.	0
ClaimBuster	10675				And I've been a careful steward of your tax dollars.	0
ClaimBuster	10676				But the people are going to have to make up their mind on this issue.	0
ClaimBuster	10677				And I think it's important to understand what happened here.	0
ClaimBuster	10678				We can meet our destiny - and that destiny to build a land here that will be, for all mankind, a shining city on a hill.	0
ClaimBuster	10679				You know what he did?	0
ClaimBuster	10680				If the wrong guy is put to death, then that's a double tragedy.	0
ClaimBuster	10681				She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler.	1
ClaimBuster	10682				I know the threats that are made against me.	0
ClaimBuster	10683				But if our national security is at stake, if we have allies, if we've tried every other course, if we're sure military action will succeed, and if the costs are proportionate to the benefits, we should get involved.	0
ClaimBuster	10684				It's going to be hard to punish them any worse after they get put to death.	0
ClaimBuster	10685				And that's why I'm introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship.	0
ClaimBuster	10686				I certainly hope it won't.	0
ClaimBuster	10687				And so the fundamental question of this campaign is: Who's going to keep the economy growing so people can work?	0
ClaimBuster	10688				And you know what happens?	0
ClaimBuster	10689				It either gets passed along as increased prices or it gets passed along by people being put out of work so the business can continue to compete.	0
ClaimBuster	10690				Coming out of World War II it made sense.	0
ClaimBuster	10691				Because we've seen this throughout the campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	10692				And then I asked for a bipartisan commission, which I'd asked for from the beginning, to sit down and work out a solution.	1
ClaimBuster	10693				I'm the president that said hey, don't mess with Social Security, and we haven't.	0
ClaimBuster	10694				I will get America working again and see rising take-home pay again, and I'll do it with five simple steps.	0
ClaimBuster	10695				Now, Governor Romney, when you were asked by teachers whether or not this would help the economy grow, you said this isn't going to help the economy grow.	1
ClaimBuster	10696				The catalyst for this housing crisis was the Fannie and Freddie Mae that caused subprime lending situation that now caused the housing market in America to collapse.	1
ClaimBuster	10697				Employment ought to be restored to our people.	0
ClaimBuster	10698				If it is uh true that there will be a $60 billion surplus by fiscal year 1981, rather than spend that money for all the new programs that Governor Carter recommends and endorses, and which are included in the Democratic platform, I think the American taxpayer ought to get an additional tax break - a tax reduction of that magnitude.	0
ClaimBuster	10699				And I'm going to get our allies back to the table.	0
ClaimBuster	10700				I want to see market economies spring up all around the world and to the degree they do, we are succeeding.	0
ClaimBuster	10701				My balanced budget covers mammograms for ladies, women on Medicare and also gives respite care to the million-plus families who have someone with Alzheimer√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s.	1
ClaimBuster	10702				The people that work in Washington, D.C. for the U.S. Congress or the United States senate.	0
ClaimBuster	10703				In Texas you could have unlimited absences to go to livestock shows.	1
ClaimBuster	10704				And that's why the failure of this administration to deal in an effective and a good-faith way with Mexico, with Costa Rica, with the other nations in trying to find a peaceful settlement to the dispute in Central America has undermined our capacity to effectively deal diplomatically in this area as well.	1
ClaimBuster	10705				We're going to see unemployment going down, more jobs available, and the rate of inflation going down.	0
ClaimBuster	10706				In Iraq, we saw a threat, and we realized that after September the 11th, we must take threats seriously, before they fully materialize.	1
ClaimBuster	10707				I'm not questioning his patriotism.	0
ClaimBuster	10708				They're going backwards on the definition for wetlands.	0
ClaimBuster	10709				"Both said that this administration turned down the ""walk in the woods'' agreement first, and that would have been a perfect agreement from the standpoint of the United States in Europe and our security."	1
ClaimBuster	10710				My philosophy on taxes has been simple.	0
ClaimBuster	10711				This is one of the most important issues in this election.	0
ClaimBuster	10712				"And he called this woman ""Miss Piggy."""	1
ClaimBuster	10713				There was a chance to get this done.	0
ClaimBuster	10714				The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state.	0
ClaimBuster	10715				The Brady Bill has kept at least 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers from getting hand guns.	1
ClaimBuster	10716				If you graduated in the top quarter of your airlines, we gave you a John and Abigail Adams scholarship, four years tuition free in the college of your choice in Massachusetts, it's a public institution.	1
ClaimBuster	10717				And then a few days later, I was there greeting the caskets coming into Andrews Air Force Base and grieving with the families.	1
ClaimBuster	10718				We have not made the progress we need to make to put people back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	10719				Now, you point out, well, we're putting some back.	0
ClaimBuster	10720				It didn't hurt the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	10721				To extend it to all the world because the Communist aim is not to hold their own but to extend Communism.	0
ClaimBuster	10722				And at the beginning of the year I had about 2 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	10723				I have a better plan for homeland security.	0
ClaimBuster	10724				Let me first answer that question about the 1982 tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	10725				That's total over the last four years.	1
ClaimBuster	10726				But I can say this, uh - I'm doing the best I can to get away from that, and during the next ten days, the American people will not see the Carter campaign running uh - television advertisements and newspaper advertisements based on a personal attack on President Ford's character.	0
ClaimBuster	10727				In the interim, there has been the development on our part primarily, the cruise missiles; cruise missiles that could be launched from land-based mobile installations; cruise missiles that could be launched - launched from high-performance aircraft, like the B-52s or the B-1s, which I hope we proceed with; cruise missiles which could be launched from either surface or submarine uh - naval vessels.	1
ClaimBuster	10728				There's going to be a new Congress because the old one -- I don't want to get this man made at me -- but there was a post office scandal and a bank scandal.	1
ClaimBuster	10729				Let me comment on that.	0
ClaimBuster	10730				90% of our kids go to public schools.	1
ClaimBuster	10731				You have to put the money into it and the funding and the leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	10732				You know, we have five percent of the world's population in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	10733				Tipper and I have been married for 30 years.	1
ClaimBuster	10734				This president rushed to war, pushed our allies aside.	0
ClaimBuster	10735				You don't have to have the government mandate that for that to occur.	0
ClaimBuster	10736				I don't think anyone really believes that you're a person who's going to be pushing for oil and gas and coal.	0
ClaimBuster	10737				They're trying to defeat us.	0
ClaimBuster	10738				And if we didn't tell him that, why won't we even let the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee see the written instructions for Ambassador Glaspie?	0
ClaimBuster	10739				The most important thing is, I believe we've got the right ideas for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	10740				Some people have a mistaken view of it in America.	0
ClaimBuster	10741				We're going to bring back law and order.	0
ClaimBuster	10742				If you pay taxes, you ought to get tax relief.	0
ClaimBuster	10743				The president -- 95 percent of the containers that come into the ports, right here in Florida, are not inspected.	1
ClaimBuster	10744				Because look at the mess that we're in.	0
ClaimBuster	10745				Two days ago in the Oval Office, I met with the finance minister from Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	10746				Hillary Clinton -- and it's extremely complex -- Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people.	1
ClaimBuster	10747				What I want to do is to create an economy that is strong, and at the same time produce energy.	0
ClaimBuster	10748				We've gone from first to twelfth in the world in wages.	1
ClaimBuster	10749				"Now, understand what this means ""without preconditions."""	0
ClaimBuster	10750				I'd be delighted to, because you can't do it the old way.	0
ClaimBuster	10751				And so is Senator Kennedy a friend of yours.	1
ClaimBuster	10752				And the Illinois Medical Society, the organization of doctors in Illinois, voted against it.	1
ClaimBuster	10753				Senator McCain continues to repeat this.	1
ClaimBuster	10754				Well, I can't say that I have roundtabled that and sat down with the Chiefs of Staff, but I have said that it seems to me that this could be a logical step in what is my ultimate goal, my ultimate dream, and that is the elimination of nuclear weapons in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	10755				The number of uninsured has now gone up for the past seven years.	1
ClaimBuster	10756				Well, I come from the computer business, and everybody knows the women are more talented than the men.	1
ClaimBuster	10757				I understand how hard it is.	0
ClaimBuster	10758				This is the kind of leadership that we've had in this administration on the most deadly issue of our times.	0
ClaimBuster	10759				And I have been given great credit for what I did.	0
ClaimBuster	10760				He complains about secrecy and yet he is quoted as saying that in the attempt to find a solution in the Middle East that he would hold unpublicized meetings with the Soviet Union - I presume for the purpose of an - imposing a settlement on Israel and the Arab nations.	1
ClaimBuster	10761				Let's go to work and end this fiasco in Central America, a failed policy which has actually increased Cuban and Soviet influence.	0
ClaimBuster	10762				Under this administration we've had a continuation of the so-called balance of power politics, where everything is looked on as a struggle between us on the one side, the Soviet Union on the other.	0
ClaimBuster	10763				Let me tell you what I tried to do about it.	0
ClaimBuster	10764				I find that just astonishing.	0
ClaimBuster	10765				I said I would cut taxes for small businesses, who are the drivers and engines of growth.	1
ClaimBuster	10766				He said he just discovered that most Soviet missiles are on land, and that's why his proposal didn't work.	1
ClaimBuster	10767				I would not meet Mr. Khrushchev unless there were some agreements at the secondary level - foreign ministers or ambassadors - which would indicate that the meeting would have some hope of success, or a useful exchange of ideas.	0
ClaimBuster	10768				I do believe Saddam Hussein was a threat.	0
ClaimBuster	10769				That's what's been squeezing middle class families.	1
ClaimBuster	10770				And it's a plan that lowers cost for everybody, covers all children.	1
ClaimBuster	10771				That's the reason I decided to run for president, and I'm hopeful that all of you are prepared to continue this extraordinary journey that we call America.	0
ClaimBuster	10772				I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year -- and that's the vast majority of Americans as you know -- will have their taxes raised, because I think we've got to go where the money is.	1
ClaimBuster	10773				We will maintain our position of neutrality in the Iran and Iraq war.	0
ClaimBuster	10774				I will do everything I can, if I get up there, to make dirty tricks a thing of the past.	0
ClaimBuster	10775				Osama bin Laden and General Petraeus have one thing in common that I know of, they both said that Iraq is the central battleground.	1
ClaimBuster	10776				I could have rationalized it.	0
ClaimBuster	10777				That's explicitly prohibited in the law.	1
ClaimBuster	10778				Well, I -- I do think...	0
ClaimBuster	10779				So I think we can all share, with respect, in the fact that maybe the message is not getting out.	0
ClaimBuster	10780				I believe all of those should be gone over in detail to make sure that no one is getting a tax break; to make sure that no one is getting away from paying the taxes he ought to pay.	0
ClaimBuster	10781				Well, the record in Arkansas.	0
ClaimBuster	10782				And he wanted to buy the business but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	10783				Now, if we get our tax policies right so that they're good for the middle class, if we reverse the policies of the last eight years that got us into this fix in the first place and that Senator McCain supported, then we are going to be in a position to deal with Social Security and deal with Medicare, because we will have a health care plan that actually works for you, reduces spending and costs over the long term, and Social Security that is stable and solvent for all Americans and not just some.	0
ClaimBuster	10784				And of course, I've been talking about the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	10785				And it would not cover several million people who are not covered by Social Security at all.	1
ClaimBuster	10786				So, look, nobody likes taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	10787				It's very important to me.	0
ClaimBuster	10788				With Mali now having North Mali taken over by Al Qaida; with Syria having Assad continuing to -- to kill, to murder his own people, this is a region in tumult.	1
ClaimBuster	10789				And yet he condemns the vetoes that I have made that has - that have saved the taxpayer $9 billion and could have saved an additional $13 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	10790				Once and for all, I want to do something about Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	10791				Understand themselves as Americans in every way except having papers.	0
ClaimBuster	10792				But Syria is no longer Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	10793				I have a different experience.	0
ClaimBuster	10794				They know the Democratic party won't do it.	0
ClaimBuster	10795				First, we've got to improve our education system and we've made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools.	1
ClaimBuster	10796				We're protecting people, they have to pay up.	0
ClaimBuster	10797				Nuclear power is not only important as far as eliminating our dependence on foreign oil but it's also responsibility as far as climate change is concerned.	0
ClaimBuster	10798				And, in fact, afterwards, Congressman Lewis put out a similar statement, saying that he had probably gone over the line.	1
ClaimBuster	10799				And we should be able to do that for our country.	0
ClaimBuster	10800				We may be able to get satisfactory assurances.	0
ClaimBuster	10801				And here he says he's going to be a fiscal conservative, all of a sudden.	1
ClaimBuster	10802				Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems.	0
ClaimBuster	10803				And I think this will work.	0
ClaimBuster	10804				And they were graphically demonstrated again today.	0
ClaimBuster	10805				And in the first few years they either learn how to learn or don't learn how to learn.	0
ClaimBuster	10806				It's not going to be quick.	0
ClaimBuster	10807				First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which...	1
ClaimBuster	10808				And I think that in that case uh - some of the more liberal uh - members of the uh - so-called Warren Court agreed with those decisions.	1
ClaimBuster	10809				We still have no comprehensive energy policy in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	10810				They're setting new records this year.	0
ClaimBuster	10811				Now, that also means that you've got more customers.	0
ClaimBuster	10812				There are some limited places where that was appropriate.	0
ClaimBuster	10813				Mr. Morgan, I suggested that if the United States felt that it could save the summit conference that it would have been proper for us to have expressed regrets.	1
ClaimBuster	10814				So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication.	0
ClaimBuster	10815				You yourself said, Mr. Vice President, a month ago, that if we had provided the kind of economic aid five years ago that we are now providing we might never have had Castro.	1
ClaimBuster	10816				We estimate that those programs would add a hundred billion dollars minimum and probably two hundred billion dollars - uhh maximum each year to the federal budget.	1
ClaimBuster	10817				And we'll continue to promote freedom around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	10818				Barbara, reluctant as I am to say anything critical about Governor Reagan, I will try to answer your question.	0
ClaimBuster	10819				May I ask for an exception because I think we owe Carole Simpson -- anybody who can stand in between these three characters here and get the job done -- we owe her a round of applause.	0
ClaimBuster	10820				The Soviet Union, for instance, put pressure on Mr. Ford and he refused to see a symbol of human freedom recognized around the world, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.	1
ClaimBuster	10821				We've got some agreement on the nuclear, but we don't have those things put away yet.	0
ClaimBuster	10822				And, among other things, I would say, okay, over here in this Senate committee to the chairman who is anxious to get this bill passed, the president who is anxious, I'd say rather than just yelling at one another, why don't we find out where we're apart, try to get together, get the bill passed and give the people the benefits and not play party politics right now.	0
ClaimBuster	10823				And in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world.	1
ClaimBuster	10824				Well over a million and a quarter Americans are HIV-positive.	1
ClaimBuster	10825				You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job.	0
ClaimBuster	10826				"I mean, look, if we want to talk about Congressman Lewis, who is an American hero, he, unprompted by my campaign, without my campaign's awareness, made a statement that he was troubled with what he was hearing at some of the rallies that your running mate was holding, in which all the Republican reports indicated were shouting, when my name came up, things like ""terrorist"" and ""kill him,"" and that you're running mate didn't mention, didn't stop, didn't say ""Hold on a second, that's kind of out of line."""	1
ClaimBuster	10827				"He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn't be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, ""Mexican."""	1
ClaimBuster	10828				The international community, the international world said this is the right thing to do, but when it came time to authorize the use of force on the Senate floor, my opponent voted against the use of force.	1
ClaimBuster	10829				I have increased, as president, by over 60 percent the funding for water treatment plants in the United States, the federal contribution.	1
ClaimBuster	10830				I think that holding onto the old ways and the old argument that the environment and the economy are in conflict is really outdated.	0
ClaimBuster	10831				It would be the largest increase in government health care ever.	0
ClaimBuster	10832				Look, we've sailed Navy ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them.	1
ClaimBuster	10833				The vice president has a long resume.	1
ClaimBuster	10834				Senator Dole remembers well that we actually offered not to even put in a healthcare bill in 1994, uh '93, but instead to work with the Senate Republicans and write a joint bill.	1
ClaimBuster	10835				In my program for energy independence we have increased, for example, solar energy research from about $84 million a year to about a hundred and twenty million dollars a year.	1
ClaimBuster	10836				So I don't want the implication to be that somehow everything we say is just cooked up and put in our head by somebody else.	0
ClaimBuster	10837				It's not that Dodd-Frank always was wrong with too much regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	10838				And this is why a tax reform is so important.	0
ClaimBuster	10839				Another thing is a system called DISC which was originally designed, proposed by Mr. Nixon, to encourage exports.	1
ClaimBuster	10840				I said I looked into his eyes and saw three letters, a K, a G and a B.	0
ClaimBuster	10841				General Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, told him he was going to need several hundred thousand.	1
ClaimBuster	10842				It's their ingenuity, I agree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	10843				If we catch somebody illegally selling a gun, there needs to be a consequence.	0
ClaimBuster	10844				It's completely out of control.	0
ClaimBuster	10845				It wasn't a government takeover of health care.	1
ClaimBuster	10846				Well, I want to make sure we're not handing the health care system over to the federal government which is basically what would ultimately happen with Senator Obama's health care plan.	0
ClaimBuster	10847				And it's free trade, fair trade that needs to be our hallmark, and we need more free trade agreements, not fewer.	0
ClaimBuster	10848				And yet that very committee of which I am chairman has been handicapped by the fact that we have not had adequate funds; we have not had adequate powers; we haven't had an adequate staff.	0
ClaimBuster	10849				I'm proud of the fact that America is stronger and more prosperous and more secure than we were four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	10850				I want the government to pinch pennies for a change instead of the American families.	0
ClaimBuster	10851				Think about that father down there in Houston who has to tell his youngster that he can't play little league ball that he can't go out on the ball field because he's afraid he's going to get hurt.	0
ClaimBuster	10852				I've spent my whole adult life very close to the military.	1
ClaimBuster	10853				Where a child can walk in and have their heart turned dark as a result of being on the Internet and walk in and decide to take somebody else's life?	0
ClaimBuster	10854				But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.	1
ClaimBuster	10855				I want to make small businesses grow and thrive.	0
ClaimBuster	10856				But I think marriage is a sacred institution.	0
ClaimBuster	10857				They want to look good.	0
ClaimBuster	10858				Well, I've been kind of a hard-liner on this issue for more than eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	10859				I'm not proud of any record.	0
ClaimBuster	10860				There are American jobs that are being lost.	0
ClaimBuster	10861				Plus the fact, that the special prosecutor, on his own initiation, and the attorney general on his initiation, the highest law enforcement official in this country, all of them have given me a clean bill of health.	1
ClaimBuster	10862				I'd just note that I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not.	0
ClaimBuster	10863				As I've studied the record between myself and Governor Reagan, I've been impressed with the stark differences that exist between us.	0
ClaimBuster	10864				But it seems to me the record is clear.	0
ClaimBuster	10865				So military security and economic security go hand in hand.	0
ClaimBuster	10866				We, I think, are the only developed nation in the world that has no comprehensive energy policy, to permit us to plan in an orderly way how to shift from increasing the scarce uh - energy uh - forms: oil, and have research and development concentrated on the increased use of coal, which I strongly favor.	0
ClaimBuster	10867				I owe the special interests nothing.	0
ClaimBuster	10868				It's more difficult to defend this nation.	0
ClaimBuster	10869				Let -- let me just finish their point, because you're looking for contrast.	0
ClaimBuster	10870				This has been an extraordinary 18 months for Kitty and me and for our family.	0
ClaimBuster	10871				We're going to have to try to provide closer ties, to associate ourselves with the great desire of these people for a better life if we're going to prevent Castro's influence from spreading throughout all of Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	10872				It's based on the plan of Governor Jim Hunt in North Carolina, and it works great.	1
ClaimBuster	10873				I want to give seniors who are, well, the near elderly, I don't like that term because I am just about in that category, but those 55 to 65 ought to be able to buy into Medicare for premiums that are reasonable and fair and significantly below what they have to get now.	0
ClaimBuster	10874				I'll see you tomorrow night -- (Laughter) on NBC -- 10:30 to 11:00 Eastern Time.	1
ClaimBuster	10875				And you can't just go up and say I'm going to fix it.	0
ClaimBuster	10876				That's something I know how to do.	0
ClaimBuster	10877				Now, you're -- and the way it would happen is that under his plan, if a school was designated as failing, the kids would be trapped there for another three years and then some of them would get federal vouchers and the state would be forced to match those, that money.	1
ClaimBuster	10878				I think you have heavy obligations which affect our security, which we're going to have to meet.	0
ClaimBuster	10879				That's the kind of leadership we've shown.	0
ClaimBuster	10880				But I think math, common sense, and our history shows us that's not a recipe for job growth.	0
ClaimBuster	10881				There was a big story I think in U.S.A. Today of the millions of people who have now registered because of it.	1
ClaimBuster	10882				Well, let -- let me say, Bob, thank you.	0
ClaimBuster	10883				The difficulty now is the president's course is quite limited.	0
ClaimBuster	10884				And the -- the central question at this point is going to be: Who is going to be credible to all parties involved?	0
ClaimBuster	10885				Now, I must say what Mr. Nixon wants to do is commit us - as I understand him, so that we can be clear if there's a disagreement - he wants us to be committed to the defense of these islands merely as the defense of these islands as free territory, not as part of the defense of Formosa.	0
ClaimBuster	10886				Five million jobs doesn't even keep up with our population growth.	1
ClaimBuster	10887				I guarantee you, as president of the United States, I know how to heal the wounds of war, I know how to deal with our adversaries, and I know how to deal with our friends.	0
ClaimBuster	10888				We relied in the Middle East on the Baghdad Pact, and yet when the Iraqi Government was changed, the Baghdad Pact broke down.	1
ClaimBuster	10889				And I would love to see the next three weeks devoted to talking about the economy, devoted to talking about health care, devoted to talking about energy, and figuring out how the American people can send their kids to college.	0
ClaimBuster	10890				So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing.	0
ClaimBuster	10891				We're going to have to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	10892				I think once a decision has been made, it's been made unless it's proven to be unsafe to women.	0
ClaimBuster	10893				It was taken away from her.	1
ClaimBuster	10894				He -- he doesn't answer that question.	1
ClaimBuster	10895				No nation will ever have a veto over us.	0
ClaimBuster	10896				They're going to see their own doctor when Bob Dole is president.	0
ClaimBuster	10897				The connection that's been made again between the deficit and the interest rates -- there is no connection between them.	1
ClaimBuster	10898				The American people see this debt, and they know it's got to come down.	0
ClaimBuster	10899				Well, I think it should be a right for every American.	0
ClaimBuster	10900				I favor the present depletion allowance.	0
ClaimBuster	10901				And if we want to talk about oil company profits, under your tax plan, John -- this is undeniable -- oil companies would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks.	1
ClaimBuster	10902				But look, Jim, the world is changing so rapidly.	0
ClaimBuster	10903				But just a few years ago you said that's something you'd never do.	1
ClaimBuster	10904				Soldiers know over there that this isn't being done right yet.	0
ClaimBuster	10905				As a matter of fact, I wouldn't support it if I thought that.	0
ClaimBuster	10906				This is an administration that gave you the big tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	10907				Now, this economic package, Tim, I'm glad you asked, because you look like the type that might be able to benefit from a 15 percent across- the-board tax cut and $500-per-child tax credit, or -- you know, estate tax relief which you're not interested in right now, but capital gains rate reduction.	0
ClaimBuster	10908				Your husband disagrees with you.	1
ClaimBuster	10909				But our training programs right now, we've got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies.	1
ClaimBuster	10910				We don't have to settle for what we're going through.	0
ClaimBuster	10911				So I think, yes, we will have to change in a very appreciable way, some of the lifestyles that we now enjoy.	0
ClaimBuster	10912				But there were some problems, some unintended consequences.	0
ClaimBuster	10913				And institutions are beginning to function.	1
ClaimBuster	10914				I do want to make sure that -- I do want to make sure that we just understand something.	0
ClaimBuster	10915				I got a- a complete report back from those countries from these two distinguished - uh - gentlemen.	1
ClaimBuster	10916				And four years ago they campaigned on getting prescription drugs for seniors.	1
ClaimBuster	10917				And not one thing did I see, with respect, on your network about my views on agriculture, and not one did I read in any newspaper.	0
ClaimBuster	10918				I want to focus on results.	0
ClaimBuster	10919				I don't know what time it is, but it's probably getting late.	0
ClaimBuster	10920				We are today subsidizing housing for more than 10 million people, and we're going to continue along that line.	1
ClaimBuster	10921				I am going to make a major speech on this whole subject next week before the next debate, and I will have an opportunity then to answer any other questions that may arise with regard to my position on it.	0
ClaimBuster	10922				Well, we still are the envy of the world in terms of our military.	0
ClaimBuster	10923				We need campaign finance reform and we need to shoot straight with young and old alike and tell them what the real choices are.	0
ClaimBuster	10924				I get audited almost every year.	1
ClaimBuster	10925				How are we going to do it?	0
ClaimBuster	10926				You heard what I was for, and that's what I support.	1
ClaimBuster	10927				But in my view, the president should have grabbed it.	0
ClaimBuster	10928				Well, my last word is again to say this: We were talking about this very simple amendment and women's rights.	0
ClaimBuster	10929				Well, I don't have time in 30 seconds, or whatever -- a minute -- to talk about our health care reform plan.	0
ClaimBuster	10930				States like Arizona, Rhode Island have taken these -- these Medicaid dollars; have shown they can run these programs more cost-effectively.	1
ClaimBuster	10931				I think the presidency of the United States is a very serious office, and I think we have to address these issues in a very serious way.	0
ClaimBuster	10932				Saddam is probably about as strong as he ever was.	0
ClaimBuster	10933				Saddam Hussein is probably better off than he was four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	10934				You know, we looked at the same intelligence and came to the same conclusion: that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat.	1
ClaimBuster	10935				I don't think that's extreme at all; and yet nearly two-thirds to three-fourths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against that proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	10936				Well, let me say that I think that we might ought to review the terms, the way it works.	0
ClaimBuster	10937				When it comes to making college affordable, whether it's two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed.	1
ClaimBuster	10938				But it certainly ought to be the long-term goal of all Americans and I think it is.	0
ClaimBuster	10939				So for instance, I would not give driver's licenses to those that have come here illegally as the president would.	1
ClaimBuster	10940				I think America's best days are still ahead, but we've got to build the right bridge.	0
ClaimBuster	10941				And once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies.	0
ClaimBuster	10942				The same is true for Michelle and I'm sure the same is true for a lot of you.	0
ClaimBuster	10943				But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they've gone wild with their nuclear program.	0
ClaimBuster	10944				And what I have said, because the free trade -- the trade agreement itself does have labor and environmental protections, but we have to stand for human rights and we have to make sure that violence isn't being perpetrated against workers who are just trying to organize for their rights, which is why, for example, I supported the Peruvian Free Trade Agreement which was a well-structured agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	10945				I talk to the Republican leaders and they want it.	1
ClaimBuster	10946				Look, the right course for America's government, we were talking about the role of government, is not to become the economic player, picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	10947				And he put a trial lawyer on the ticket.	1
ClaimBuster	10948				Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country?	0
ClaimBuster	10949				They want to judge it on the record itself.	0
ClaimBuster	10950				I think everyone's paying too much, but I think this idea that you can go out and -- then he hits me for vetoing a tax bill.	0
ClaimBuster	10951				I believe the role of government is to stand side by side with our citizens to help them realize their dreams, not tell citizens how to live their lives.	0
ClaimBuster	10952				Because they wanted to have the same choice that you and I and Cindy and your wife have had.	0
ClaimBuster	10953				And that's the kind of presidency I want to lead.	0
ClaimBuster	10954				I want to see us finalize that START agreement and I want it to be the one to finally lead the world to banishing chemical and biological weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	10955				That's what the election was about.	0
ClaimBuster	10956				But it seemed to me there's got to be some end to the frivolous lawsuits and there's got to be some cap on punitive damage.	0
ClaimBuster	10957				And production on gas --	0
ClaimBuster	10958				I have maintained from the very beginning of my campaign, and this was a standard answer that I made in response to the Yugoslavian question, that I would never uh - go to war or become militarily involved, in the internal affairs of another country unless our own security was direc- rectly threatened.	0
ClaimBuster	10959				Now, I could get rid of it in 4 years in theory on the books now, but to do it you'd have to raise taxes too much and cut benefits too much to people who need them and it would even make the economy worse.	0
ClaimBuster	10960				I'm not as confident as he is that we will be the strongest military power by 1963.	0
ClaimBuster	10961				And right now, as you know, the US took the lead in a no-fly operation up there in-- no- fly order up in the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	10962				Well, I would say that one meeting that made a profound impression on me was when the mayors of the big cities, including the mayor of Los Angeles, a Democrat, came to see me, and they unanimously said the decline in urban America stems from the decline in the American family.	1
ClaimBuster	10963				Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	10964				You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials.	1
ClaimBuster	10965				I've stood up to Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	10966				But we're investing a much smaller percentage of our income in the things you just asked about than all of our major competitors, and our wealth growth is going down as a result of it.	1
ClaimBuster	10967				They were choking on the sanctions.	0
ClaimBuster	10968				The bottom line is this: I think the American people, thought he'd recite all these bills and all these things, they want to know what's going to happen to them.	0
ClaimBuster	10969				I've acknowledged that in union halls across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	10970				And perhaps the biggest is world peace.	0
ClaimBuster	10971				No, but I'm glad you asked that question, because I know it's on many peoples' minds.	0
ClaimBuster	10972				We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets.	1
ClaimBuster	10973				So I've thought long and hard about the honor of being the President of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	10974				The point was made by Mr. Nixon that the Soviet production is only forty-four percent of ours.	1
ClaimBuster	10975				We balanced the budget in the '90s.	1
ClaimBuster	10976				The facts are though -- the facts are -- the American people are hurting.	0
ClaimBuster	10977				Bob, let me -- let me respond.	0
ClaimBuster	10978				If you don't mind, I'd like to use the balance of the time to respond to one of the comments that Senator Kennedy made on the previous question.	0
ClaimBuster	10979				It gets larger even with growth.	0
ClaimBuster	10980				For instance, we now have uh - in the health area three hundred and two different programs administered by eleven major departments and agencies, sixty other advisory commissions responsible for this.	1
ClaimBuster	10981				Recognize that we have a voluntary military.	0
ClaimBuster	10982				But don't just sit here slow dancing for 4 years doing nothing.	0
ClaimBuster	10983				We wanted to have majority rule with the full protection of the rights of the minority.	0
ClaimBuster	10984				We've opened up public lands.	1
ClaimBuster	10985				He forgot to tell you he voted to tax Social Security benefits more than one time.	1
ClaimBuster	10986				I'm not gonna raise taxes on middle class Americans to pay for the programs I've recommended.	0
ClaimBuster	10987				They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life.	0
ClaimBuster	10988				I see the Middle East with a rising tide of violence, chaos, tumult.	0
ClaimBuster	10989				You're running ads that misportray completely my position on immigration.	0
ClaimBuster	10990				He fails to point out that uh - in the 1950s we were engaged in the war in Vietnam.	1
ClaimBuster	10991				And you voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	10992				You're going to see health premiums go up by some $2,500 per family.	0
ClaimBuster	10993				China has been a currency manipulator for years and years and years.	1
ClaimBuster	10994				Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money.	0
ClaimBuster	10995				Middle-class people, defined as people with incomes of $52,000 and down, had their incomes go down while their taxes went up in the Reagan-Bush years because of 6 increases in the payroll taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	10996				When I was a young man, when I got out of the Navy I had multiple job offers.	1
ClaimBuster	10997				Along with what he also wants to do in terms of eliminating the estate tax, along what he wants to do in terms of corporates, changes in the tax code, it costs about $5 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	10998				You know, we went on the Libyan raid -- do you remember that one?	1
ClaimBuster	10999				And she's been talking about the inner cities for 25 years.	1
ClaimBuster	11000				And what did you do right after the election?	0
ClaimBuster	11001				If you want somebody who is willing to fight for you, I am asking for your support and your vote and, yes, your confidence and your willingness to believe that we can do the right thing in America, and be the better for it.	0
ClaimBuster	11002				We returned $5.7 billion in tax rebates, credits and cuts to our people.	1
ClaimBuster	11003				Number two is to cut spending.	0
ClaimBuster	11004				And as a matter of fact, when the president ran for office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2,500 a family.	1
ClaimBuster	11005				22 million new jobs, very low unemployment nationally.	1
ClaimBuster	11006				The federal government can get local and -- and state schools to do a better job.	0
ClaimBuster	11007				I think the principal that separates me is that 5 and a half million people came together on their own and put me on the ballot.	1
ClaimBuster	11008				You don't take America to war unless have the plan to win the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	11009				We've got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America.	0
ClaimBuster	11010				We have a very divided nation.	1
ClaimBuster	11011				I said well, this is simple.	1
ClaimBuster	11012				If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed.	1
ClaimBuster	11013				So why pass a law that won't fix it?	0
ClaimBuster	11014				No insult ever cleaned up a toxic waste dump or helped an elderly person.	1
ClaimBuster	11015				Of course, we have to do some things tactically, some of which Senator Obama is correct on.	0
ClaimBuster	11016				It is the kind of change that can open up a whole new world of opportunities to America as we enter the last decade of this century and move towards the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	11017				All that his advisers do is to give counsel when he asks for it.	0
ClaimBuster	11018				I'm not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	11019				We need to have more community health centers.	0
ClaimBuster	11020				Pay $1 an hour for your labor, have no health care -- that's the most expensive single element in making the car.	1
ClaimBuster	11021				I cannot let this go by, the old-style Washington politics, of we're going to scare you in the voting booth.	0
ClaimBuster	11022				That is a very important objective -- to make certain that we continue to look forward to progress toward greater independence by these nations and work with each of them separately.	0
ClaimBuster	11023				And I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn't have a place in Donald Trump's America.	1
ClaimBuster	11024				I think we need to put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox.	0
ClaimBuster	11025				And if you make a mistake, say you made a mistake and go on about your business, trying to serve the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	11026				"He went so far as to call it ""brutal economics."""	1
ClaimBuster	11027				The Office of Minority Business in the Department of Commerce has made available more money in trying to help uh - black businessmen or other minority businessmen than any other administration since the office was established.	1
ClaimBuster	11028				There are some other things that have been said here -- back, and you said that I might be able to dredge them up.	0
ClaimBuster	11029				And we know that, if we drill off-shore and exploit a lot of these reserves, it will help, at temporarily, relieve our energy requirements.	0
ClaimBuster	11030				I would not let the Soviet Union get their hands on it at all.	0
ClaimBuster	11031				We can debate methods, we can debate one decision or another, but there are two uh things which cannot be debated - experience and results.	0
ClaimBuster	11032				It was a trial lawyer's dream.	0
ClaimBuster	11033				I don't appoint people I think are liberal or people who think - who I think are conservative.	0
ClaimBuster	11034				And in my view, the Constitution ought to be interpreted as a document that grows with our country and our history.	0
ClaimBuster	11035				I think the reason that we're not saying send American troops in at this point is severalfold.	0
ClaimBuster	11036				Governor Carter in his acceptance speech called for more and more programs, which means more and more government.	0
ClaimBuster	11037				What I've said is we're going to encourage democracy in Pakistan, expand our nonmilitary aid to Pakistan so that they have more of a stake in working with us, but insisting that they go after these militants.	1
ClaimBuster	11038				And you know what you'll find?	0
ClaimBuster	11039				And now with the financial crisis, car dealerships are closing and people can't get car loans.	1
ClaimBuster	11040				The trillion dollars comes out of the surplus so that you can invest some of your own money.	1
ClaimBuster	11041				Now this just wasn't true.	1
ClaimBuster	11042				And I'll tell you this, I will fight for a clean environment in ways that strengthen our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	11043				And the promise of the revolution was democracy, human rights, free labor unions, free press.	1
ClaimBuster	11044				We have a program for a gradual reduction of Government spending based on these theories, and I have a task force now that has been working on where those cuts could be made.	0
ClaimBuster	11045				I said she doesn't have the stamina.	1
ClaimBuster	11046				And when Senator McCain says that he wants to provide children health care, what he doesn't mention is he voted against the expansion of the Children's Health Insurance Program that is responsible for making sure that so many children who didn't have previously health insurance have it now.	1
ClaimBuster	11047				We in effect tried to make Israel the scapegoat for the problems in the Middle East.	1
ClaimBuster	11048				That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business.	0
ClaimBuster	11049				His plan is three times larger than President Clinton's proposed plan eight years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	11050				And we worked together with Democrats to relieve the tax burden on the middle class and all who pay taxes in order to make sure this economy continues to grow.	1
ClaimBuster	11051				I say the one thing you have over me is experience, but it's bad experience, because what you've done has turned out badly.	0
ClaimBuster	11052				So I think the American people, including the Perot supporters, know that I have had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform, and I will continue to have.	1
ClaimBuster	11053				Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad.	0
ClaimBuster	11054				I'd like to respond to that.	0
ClaimBuster	11055				Now, the reason I think that it's important to just get these facts out is because the allegation that Senator McCain has continually made is that somehow my associations are troubling.	0
ClaimBuster	11056				You can't get there from here and the fact is that we can create 700,000 jobs by building constructing 45 new nuclear power plants by the year 2030.	0
ClaimBuster	11057				Well, let me -- let me start by saying, words matter.	0
ClaimBuster	11058				I disagree with the proposal that maybe only when oil supplies are at stake that our national security is at risk.	0
ClaimBuster	11059				And, so, I'm encouraged with what I see when I talk to Mr. -- what I hear when I talk to Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadze, but can they pull it off.	0
ClaimBuster	11060				And everybody's getting a fair shot.	0
ClaimBuster	11061				In other words, there is a growing public confidence in the strength of this economy.	1
ClaimBuster	11062				I thought it was a good program.	0
ClaimBuster	11063				Candy, I don't have a policy of stopping wind jobs in Iowa and that -- they're not phantom jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	11064				Osama bin Laden isn't going to determine how we defend ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	11065				Because they understand that our military is overextended under the president.	0
ClaimBuster	11066				That's where growth will come from.	0
ClaimBuster	11067				The governor said that he doesn't think this problem is necessarily caused by people.	1
ClaimBuster	11068				I support clean coal technology.	0
ClaimBuster	11069				And we have stood on the side of democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	11070				We're living in an interconnected world.	1
ClaimBuster	11071				And I ask you to embark on that journey with me.	0
ClaimBuster	11072				That's why I fight against poverty.	0
ClaimBuster	11073				We can be once again.	0
ClaimBuster	11074				I think that in the aftermath of the Cold War, it's time for us to do something very similar, to step up to the plate, to provide the leadership on the environment, leadership to make sure the world economy keeps moving in the right direction.	0
ClaimBuster	11075				Because she has been a disaster as a senator.	0
ClaimBuster	11076				We were succeeding, and that was why the terrorist acts began.	0
ClaimBuster	11077				I want to take one-half of the surplus and dedicate it to Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	11078				I think if the president is responsible, if he consults with those involved, if he makes it clear that the Supreme Court decision is going to be carried out in a way that the Supreme Court planned - with deliberate speed - then in my judgment, providing he's behind action, I believe we can make uh - progress.	0
ClaimBuster	11079				And they know who appropriates the money.	0
ClaimBuster	11080				But I would like to use my remaining time on this exchange, Jim, to respond to an exchange that took place just a moment ago.	0
ClaimBuster	11081				Cutting taxes on the wealthy, we've tried that.	1
ClaimBuster	11082				Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine.	1
ClaimBuster	11083				We were celebrating our Bicentennial; and I find that uh - there is a - a movement as I travel around the country of greater interest in this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	11084				And that's why it's essential that we have strong alliances, and we do.	0
ClaimBuster	11085				I've got an agenda that I want to get done for the country.	0
ClaimBuster	11086				I believe the ideal world is one in which every child is protected in law and welcomed to life.	0
ClaimBuster	11087				Hillary Clinton has been after this for years.	1
ClaimBuster	11088				It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one Republican to join, at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House - not one Republican - and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it.	1
ClaimBuster	11089				It had bipartisan support; it should have had bipartisan support.	1
ClaimBuster	11090				We've got them all out there.	1
ClaimBuster	11091				And I've said this to President Karzai.	1
ClaimBuster	11092				... but those other charges, as she knows, are false.	1
ClaimBuster	11093				Well, my first job as commander in chief, Bob, is to keep the American people safe.	0
ClaimBuster	11094				I am optimistic and I believe we can keep this longest expansion going.	0
ClaimBuster	11095				And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad.	0
ClaimBuster	11096				If we're $4 trillion down, we should have everything perfect, but we don't.	1
ClaimBuster	11097				They see scandals almost on a daily basis.	0
ClaimBuster	11098				"I don't know how you vote ""present"" on some of that."	0
ClaimBuster	11099				Of course, he voted for the resolution - it was virtually unanimous.	1
ClaimBuster	11100				Actually, you'd have to have some amendments to the Constitution because of the way the Constitution reads.	0
ClaimBuster	11101				Take, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	11102				Well, some of those facts and figures just don't stand up.	0
ClaimBuster	11103				Yes, I think we should look at the punitive and we should have some limitations.	0
ClaimBuster	11104				One thing I think Americans should be proud of, when Tunisians began to protest, this nation -- me, my administration -- stood with them earlier than just about any country.	1
ClaimBuster	11105				I'm optimistic about the future.	0
ClaimBuster	11106				And education is my number one priority, because I think that it's the most important big major change that we can bring in our country.	0
ClaimBuster	11107				He doesn't take that position that I've seen so far in Laos.	0
ClaimBuster	11108				Now, I think we should be reluctant to get involved in someplace in a foreign country.	0
ClaimBuster	11109				You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change.	0
ClaimBuster	11110				Then the multilateral force withdrew for only one reason: We withdrew because we were no longer able to carry out the mission for which we had been sent in.	1
ClaimBuster	11111				We were the first ones to put sanctions on.	1
ClaimBuster	11112				I think Mr. Benson's program has failed.	0
ClaimBuster	11113				You know, give you a little tax cut, give you a couple of years, then make the tax increases go on forever.	0
ClaimBuster	11114				The CBO says we'll have a trillion-dollar deficit each of the next four years.	1
ClaimBuster	11115				I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited.	1
ClaimBuster	11116				I might say this in closing, and that is that as far as foreign policy goes, Mr. Kissinger has been the president of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	11117				No, Morton, I don't agree to all of those things.	0
ClaimBuster	11118				Gas is a clean fuel that we can burn to -- we need to make sure that if we decontrol our plants that there's mandatory -- that the plants must conform to clean air standards, the grandfathered plants, that's what we did in Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	11119				Well, the President can define himself in any way he wants, but I think we have to look at the record.	0
ClaimBuster	11120				Governor Bush is for vouchers, and in his plan he proposes to drain more money, more taxpayer money out of the public schools for private school vouchers than all of the money that he proposes in his entire budget for public schools themselves.	1
ClaimBuster	11121				And also domestic exploration yes, but not in the environmental treasures of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	11122				I've tried to find the common ground, because that's what makes us strong as Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	11123				No litmus test except for how they interpret the Constitution.	0
ClaimBuster	11124				And if you enter bilateral talks, they'll be happy to walk away from the table.	0
ClaimBuster	11125				There's no easy way to do this when you're dealing with an economy that's traditionally been more closed than one that's traditionally been more open.	0
ClaimBuster	11126				Mr. Bush's Bureau of Labor Statistics says that Arkansas ranks first in the country in the growth of new jobs this year, first.	1
ClaimBuster	11127				And the final judgment about the future of the nation - war, peace, involvement, reticence, thoughtfulness, care, consideration, concern - has to be made by the man in the Oval Office.	0
ClaimBuster	11128				And if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney's proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere.	0
ClaimBuster	11129				My economic plan, my trade position, Bosnia, Haiti, taking on the NRA for the first time, taking on the tobacco companies for the first time.	1
ClaimBuster	11130				We deliberately took figures that we, ourselves, believed were too conservative.	0
ClaimBuster	11131				And we made good progress early on.	0
ClaimBuster	11132				As a matter of fact - now- I don't advocate amnesty; I advocate pardon.	0
ClaimBuster	11133				I mention the last debate --	1
ClaimBuster	11134				That's one of the big disagreements that we have with the President -- that they have not pursued the diplomatic opportunities either within El Salvador or as between the countries and have lost time during which we might have been able to achieve a peace	1
ClaimBuster	11135				We may have different approaches.	0
ClaimBuster	11136				And, America, this is one of those issues that separates the president and myself.	0
ClaimBuster	11137				I signed the partial-birth -- the ban on partial-birth abortion.	1
ClaimBuster	11138				And we're bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero.	1
ClaimBuster	11139				We keep the good faith and credit of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	11140				And he went on to cite three issues that their platforms totally ignore: atomic warfare, Presidential Directive 59 notwithstanding.	1
ClaimBuster	11141				We are in a very difficult time.	0
ClaimBuster	11142				As long as there is a Democratic President in the White House, we will have a strong and viable Social Security System, free of the threat of bankruptcy.	0
ClaimBuster	11143				That, however, is raising taxes for those who pay Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	11144				It's going to be one of the themes you hear tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	11145				We've got to begin to get back to the business of building and rehabilitating housing for families of low and moderate income in this country; housing for young families that they can look forward some day to buy.	0
ClaimBuster	11146				"In answer to your question about Iraq and sending people into Iraq, he just said, ""The enemy attacked us."""	1
ClaimBuster	11147				He voted to increase taxes 98 times.	1
ClaimBuster	11148				Maybe that's part of the answer.	0
ClaimBuster	11149				You're not going to be targeted in or targeted out.	0
ClaimBuster	11150				I certainly agree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	11151				I served at the UN.	1
ClaimBuster	11152				I would just point out, on the point Mr. Perot made, I agree that we need to cut spending in Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	11153				And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid -- the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that's going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	11154				Now Governor Romney had a very different response.	1
ClaimBuster	11155				And other Americans have been singled out because of their race or ethnicity.	1
ClaimBuster	11156				This was just a few weeks ago that you indicated that we should still have troops in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	11157				It means also helping local school districts that sometimes find the parents of school age children outvoted on bond issues, to give them some help with interest-free bonding authority so that we can build new schools and modernize the classrooms.	0
ClaimBuster	11158				"You said it when President Carter said that you were going to cut Medicare, and you said, ""Oh, no, there you go again, Mr."	1
ClaimBuster	11159				I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really...	0
ClaimBuster	11160				One of the reasons I was successful as the governor of Texas is because I didn't try to be all things to all people.	0
ClaimBuster	11161				Now, I could probably give you some other examples of decisions over the last 24 years.	0
ClaimBuster	11162				In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt said in his inaugural that this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny.	1
ClaimBuster	11163				And I've been out here for 13 months meeting in meetings just like this ever since October, with people like you all over America, people that have lost their jobs, lost their livelihood, lost their health insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	11164				Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy.	1
ClaimBuster	11165				Everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief.	0
ClaimBuster	11166				I would challenge Mr. Gorbachev to join with us in limiting in eliminating regional conflict in the Middle East, in Central America.	0
ClaimBuster	11167				And in the meantime, they weren't going after Al Qaida, and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	11168				By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o'clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi.	0
ClaimBuster	11169				We're way behind, which means Americans can't come home.	0
ClaimBuster	11170				I don't think that is a smart strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	11171				Well, let me give you some advice.	0
ClaimBuster	11172				And if you're modest income, you're worse off.	0
ClaimBuster	11173				Now, Senator McCain is also right that it's difficult.	0
ClaimBuster	11174				In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor -- signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder.	1
ClaimBuster	11175				We'll keep the lid on some of these programs that we can hold down as we have a little extra money to spend for those quality-of-life programs which I think are needed and necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	11176				Now, I believe that in an election when we are trying to determine who should lead the free world - not just America - perhaps, as Senator Kennedy has already indicated, the most important election in our history - it isn't the label that he wears or that I wear that counts.	1
ClaimBuster	11177				We're gonna run out of oil.	0
ClaimBuster	11178				I've had one position, one consistent position, that Saddam Hussein was a threat.	1
ClaimBuster	11179				Just recently, President Rabin said that our relations were never better.	1
ClaimBuster	11180				But everybody knew what we were doing and I've opposed that.	0
ClaimBuster	11181				This is about getting the economy moving again.	0
ClaimBuster	11182				And I think you will.	0
ClaimBuster	11183				And talk to any head of any of those key committees in the Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	11184				Now, what it really boils down to is can you live -- we become so preoccupied with the rights of the criminal that we've forgotten the rights of the innocent.	0
ClaimBuster	11185				Right next to the last.	0
ClaimBuster	11186				So the fact is, let's look at our records, Senator Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	11187				Congress can't order the president around.	1
ClaimBuster	11188				And you see, I think we're facing a real opportunity for world peace.	0
ClaimBuster	11189				They're not able to do it and our future depends upon it.	1
ClaimBuster	11190				But the president's been slow to do that, even in Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	11191				Margaret, once again, I don't know which George Bush I'm talking about here or looking at.	0
ClaimBuster	11192				In the same way that you initially opposed a timetable in Afghanistan, now you're for it, although it depends.	1
ClaimBuster	11193				Now, my point is this: Senator Kennedy has got to be consistent here.	0
ClaimBuster	11194				If you're happy with the system you can stay in it.	0
ClaimBuster	11195				We use something called Race to the Top.	1
ClaimBuster	11196				I will keep Social Security in a lockbox and that pays down the national debt.	0
ClaimBuster	11197				Now that is the difference.	0
ClaimBuster	11198				He talks about a grand idea: Let's have a summit; we're going to solve the problem in Iraq by holding a summit.	1
ClaimBuster	11199				I don't really think about him very much.	0
ClaimBuster	11200				We obviously have to stop this spending spree that's going on in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	11201				There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this.	1
ClaimBuster	11202				They put about, you know, 60% of the strings where you have to fill out the paperwork.	1
ClaimBuster	11203				The United Nations was not effective at removing Saddam Hussein.	0
ClaimBuster	11204				But let's look at where I think the real mistake was made.	0
ClaimBuster	11205				[Laughter] And people will remember that you signed the biggest tax increase in the history of California and the biggest tax increase in the history of the United States, and what are you going to do?	1
ClaimBuster	11206				This uh - administration's record on environment is very bad.	0
ClaimBuster	11207				It's how we unfortunately label certain children.	1
ClaimBuster	11208				Let me tell you my position.	0
ClaimBuster	11209				And I will tell you: No, I have not.	0
ClaimBuster	11210				It becomes a tool, a corrective tool.	0
ClaimBuster	11211				We can build that bridge to the 21st Century.	0
ClaimBuster	11212				Senator McCain and I actually agree on two things that he just mentioned.	1
ClaimBuster	11213				I asked for and received the same briefing.	1
ClaimBuster	11214				Well, we have in our economic pack, -- individual retirement accounts where we think it will encourage savings.	0
ClaimBuster	11215				He said he was optimistic when he came here, then he turned on the TV and listened to the political rhetoric and all of a sudden he was pessimistic.	0
ClaimBuster	11216				And we got weapons of mass destruction crossing the border every single day, and they're blowing people up.	1
ClaimBuster	11217				The President doesn't have any ideas so he's out trashing ours.	0
ClaimBuster	11218				They will move her forward faster, and they will move her more surely than in his program.	0
ClaimBuster	11219				And Senator McCain voted for four out of five of those George Bush budgets.	1
ClaimBuster	11220				We've got battling green eye shades.	0
ClaimBuster	11221				And what I did was work with our joint chiefs of staff to think about, what are we going to need in the future to make sure that we are safe?	0
ClaimBuster	11222				We won the Olympics, in part, because we've had civil rights laws and the laws that prohibit discrimination against women.	0
ClaimBuster	11223				It has stood for a strong foreign policy and a strong national defense, and as a result, produced Wilson, President Roosevelt, and President Truman.	1
ClaimBuster	11224				I had one opportunity to nominate uh - an individual to the Supreme Court and I selected the Circuit Court of Appeals judge from Illinois, uh - John Paul Stevens.	1
ClaimBuster	11225				That has not been debunked.	1
ClaimBuster	11226				That's the only way we're going to be able to keep the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	11227				I get it down to a level below 2 percent of gross national product with a policy that's fair.	1
ClaimBuster	11228				And if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, I'll do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her.	0
ClaimBuster	11229				We have record numbers of new small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	11230				He never apologizes or says he's sorry for anything.	1
ClaimBuster	11231				Boy, to listen to that -- the president, I don't think, is living in a world of reality with respect to the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	11232				We don't have to settle for gasoline at four bucks.	0
ClaimBuster	11233				That's an example of, I think, the kind of use of the scalpel that we want to make sure that we're funding some of those programs.	0
ClaimBuster	11234				I think the experience of the twenties has shown what a free market could do to agriculture.	1
ClaimBuster	11235				.... women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.	0
ClaimBuster	11236				On the other hand, two years ago, I said that we've got a sub-prime lending crisis that has to be dealt with.	1
ClaimBuster	11237				Every parent should know what's going on there.	0
ClaimBuster	11238				He would rather spend the family's $1800 and I would rather the Strunks spend their own money.	0
ClaimBuster	11239				And I regret some of the negative aspects of both campaigns.	0
ClaimBuster	11240				It's important for our future uhh - economic security that that job be nonpolitical and uh - separate from the executive and the Legislative branches.	0
ClaimBuster	11241				Look, you have to build a consensus, but in some things -- Ross mentioned Saddam Hussein.	1
ClaimBuster	11242				We're going to make elections.	0
ClaimBuster	11243				The Governor has to balance the budget in his state he is required to by law.	1
ClaimBuster	11244				That's saying we're cutting the rates.	1
ClaimBuster	11245				We may have different approaches.	0
ClaimBuster	11246				You may have said that, too.	0
ClaimBuster	11247				I am a son of a Methodist minister.	1
ClaimBuster	11248				We can make it move.	0
ClaimBuster	11249				Because America must be able to grow enough not only to take care of our needs at home for better education and housing and health - all these things we want.	0
ClaimBuster	11250				He said a while back that the big problem with energy is that for 30 years, politicians in Washington haven't done anything.	1
ClaimBuster	11251				And finally in that 90- day period before the inauguration, put together the framework for the town hall and give the American people a Christmas present.	0
ClaimBuster	11252				This is 1980 and not 1966.	1
ClaimBuster	11253				Now, just for the record, I don't have any spin doctors.	1
ClaimBuster	11254				Your definition of national strength is to throw money at the Defense Department.	0
ClaimBuster	11255				That's what we've done, made some adjustments to it, and we're putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan...	1
ClaimBuster	11256				We have presided over the largest increase in government since the Great Society.	1
ClaimBuster	11257				Stand in the South Bronx as I did, in the spot where Jimmy Carter made his promise that he was going to, with multi-billion dollar programs, refurbish that area that looks like bombed-out London in World War II.	1
ClaimBuster	11258				I remember the night before I became Vice President.	0
ClaimBuster	11259				It has been a good, lively exchange.	0
ClaimBuster	11260				I've developed -- put out money in my budget to expand community health centers all around the country.	1
ClaimBuster	11261				That means not only military strength and our values, it also means keeping our economy strong.	0
ClaimBuster	11262				And just inevitably, they're going to be reluctant to hire Hispanics or people with a different accent.	0
ClaimBuster	11263				And frankly we have to consider what the risks are to our young men and women in uniform.	0
ClaimBuster	11264				What is an article of faith for me is not something that I can legislate on somebody who doesn't share that article of faith.	0
ClaimBuster	11265				And abroad, we're at war.	1
ClaimBuster	11266				Absolutely we've got to make sure they get educated.	0
ClaimBuster	11267				We've got plenty of lawmakers in Washington, D.C.	0
ClaimBuster	11268				But for us to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested would bring results which I know he would not want, and certainly which the American people would not want.	0
ClaimBuster	11269				And in the budget that I recommended we cut it in half - a growth rate of 5 to 5 and one-half percent.	1
ClaimBuster	11270				Chris Reeve exercises every single day to keep those muscles alive for the day when he believes he can walk again, and I want him to walk again.	1
ClaimBuster	11271				But all this by itself is not enough.	0
ClaimBuster	11272				China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	11273				I want to do something about Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	11274				We suggested -- I think it has been over a year ago now -- we do the same with Medicare, and the White House called it a gimmick.	1
ClaimBuster	11275				I've worked hard in the State of Texas to make sure our institutions reflect the state with good, smart policy.	0
ClaimBuster	11276				But I've supported Medicare ever since.	1
ClaimBuster	11277				America owes you a debt of gratitude.	0
ClaimBuster	11278				You can go around the world - and let me take Israel for example.	0
ClaimBuster	11279				I urged the president to support this air cover, and he did--and I applaud that.	1
ClaimBuster	11280				Well, first I have to say one thing, very important.	0
ClaimBuster	11281				The matter has been thoroughly looked into.	0
ClaimBuster	11282				That's been a consistent policy, one I intend to carry out.	0
ClaimBuster	11283				He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings.	1
ClaimBuster	11284				They're a member of the axis of evil.	0
ClaimBuster	11285				And I want to make sure the outcome honors that nobility.	0
ClaimBuster	11286				I know that the CIA is already going forward with one.	1
ClaimBuster	11287				It would ruin the quality of health care in America.	0
ClaimBuster	11288				It ought to be a quiet strength based on the integrity of our people, the vision of the Constitution, an in- innate strong will and purpose that God's given us in the greatest nation on earth - the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	11289				"First thing I'm going to do,"" despite the fact that it's the same health care plan that he passed in Massachusetts and is working well."	1
ClaimBuster	11290				And I will invest in education, health care, protecting the environment and retirement security.	0
ClaimBuster	11291				General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we're doing in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	11292				The consequences of defeat would have been increased Iranian influence.	0
ClaimBuster	11293				I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	11294				Four years in a row, Democrats and Republicans came together to balance the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	11295				We have achieved a five and three quarter year uh - sale of a minimum six million metric tons, which means that they have already bought about four million metric tons this year and are bound to buy another two million metric tons to take the grain and corn and wheat that the American farmers have produced in order to uh - have full production.	1
ClaimBuster	11296				Maybe that explains why Medicare patients are complaining about being pushed off of Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	11297				We're going to make it affordable and accessible.	0
ClaimBuster	11298				They don't want us to control it, very candidly.	0
ClaimBuster	11299				Maybe someone would call it a character trait, maybe somebody wouldn't.	0
ClaimBuster	11300				And I will do everything that's required to prevent it.	0
ClaimBuster	11301				And we've got to get the financial package working much quicker than it has been working.	0
ClaimBuster	11302				And I wish I had been wrong for the sake of the country and they had been right, but that's not the case.	0
ClaimBuster	11303				I know how to win.	0
ClaimBuster	11304				By the way, my friend, Dr. Kissinger, who's been my friend for 35 years, would be interested to hear this conversation and Senator Obama's depiction of his -- of his positions on the issue.	1
ClaimBuster	11305				Number three, we've got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes.	0
ClaimBuster	11306				Well, of course I don't concur with what the president said about my own record and the things that I've said.	0
ClaimBuster	11307				I believe the United States is at peace tonight in part because of the disciplined, careful, effective deployment of our military resources.	0
ClaimBuster	11308				We have inflation because the Government is living too well.	0
ClaimBuster	11309				The Russians have a lot of sway in that part of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	11310				I'd like to mention one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	11311				We've got to put an end to that.	0
ClaimBuster	11312				"I don't think it's enough for Senator Kennedy to go before the audiences on the Democratic side and say, ""Vote for me because I'm a Democrat."""	0
ClaimBuster	11313				But you know why the Pell Grants have gone up in their numbers?	0
ClaimBuster	11314				The question of Communism within the United States has been one that has worried us in the past.	0
ClaimBuster	11315				(APPLAUSE) And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women.	0
ClaimBuster	11316				My word is my bond.	0
ClaimBuster	11317				Because our energy is low cost, that are already beginning to come back because of our abundant energy.	1
ClaimBuster	11318				And I think the figures that he has given are simply not going to stand up.	0
ClaimBuster	11319				I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.	0
ClaimBuster	11320				And he will not advise me in the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	11321				I've done more to eliminate Affirmative Action programs I didn't think were fair and tighten others up than my predecessors have, since affirmative action's been around.	1
ClaimBuster	11322				You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators.	1
ClaimBuster	11323				And now I listen how she's going to get rid of ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	11324				We also need to hold on to equal pay.	0
ClaimBuster	11325				They are -- the conspicuousness of their presence is only matched by our absence, because we've been focused on Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	11326				I want to give every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit.	0
ClaimBuster	11327				You've been through the roughest weeks anybody could imagine.	0
ClaimBuster	11328				I think my programs are far less inflationary than those of Governor Reagan.	0
ClaimBuster	11329				If you reduce the out-go of Social Security, that money would not go into the general fund to reduce a deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	11330				But let me just tell you my position on guns in general, sir, if you don't mind.	0
ClaimBuster	11331				Look at all these women Senate candidates we have here.	0
ClaimBuster	11332				But I've always said trickle-down government is bad.	1
ClaimBuster	11333				My priority is putting people back to work in America.	0
ClaimBuster	11334				And that's what's happening in Afghanistan and Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	11335				During the Depression era, we had a thing called the home ownership loan corporation.	1
ClaimBuster	11336				I don't believe Mr. Perot feels this way, but I know Governor Clinton did because I want to accurately quote him.	0
ClaimBuster	11337				We haven't got 12 days, folks.	0
ClaimBuster	11338				And that's why the FDA and that's why the surgeon general are looking very carefully to make sure it can be done in a safe way.	1
ClaimBuster	11339				Then we went in with the multinational force to help remove, and did remove, more than 13,000 of those terrorists from Lebanon.	1
ClaimBuster	11340				"When Senator Obama was first asked, he said, ""Any place, any time,"" the way Barry Goldwater and Jack Kennedy agreed to do, before the intervention of the tragedy at Dallas."	1
ClaimBuster	11341				And what that's going to do is a disaster for the country.	0
ClaimBuster	11342				And, you know, I was raised by a single mom who had to put herself through school while looking after two kids.	1
ClaimBuster	11343				Well, if you're wealthy, you're better off.	0
ClaimBuster	11344				This is an - a typical example, maybe of many others, where this administration overthrew an elected government and helped to establish a military dictatorship.	1
ClaimBuster	11345				Put a head fake on us.	0
ClaimBuster	11346				We - I mean in Korea - we had uh - three million five hundred thousand young men uh - in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines.	1
ClaimBuster	11347				It happened because I could work with people -- Republicans and Democrats.	1
ClaimBuster	11348				Again, if you're not rich, you're not a superpower.	0
ClaimBuster	11349				The President has always maintained and very properly so that he is entitled to get what advice he wants from his cabinet and from his other advisers without disclosing that to anybody - including as a matter of fact the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	11350				You see, I want the families to have the choice.	0
ClaimBuster	11351				We have written agreements and we have some missiles that have been destroyed, but we have a huge number of intercontinental ballistic missiles that are still in place in Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	11352				Can we say, really say that we will be better off when we pull away from sort of that basic American instinct of decency and fairness?	0
ClaimBuster	11353				President Truman vetoed on the average, while he was president, about thirty-eight bills a year.	1
ClaimBuster	11354				Secondly, we passed a federal aid to education bill in the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	11355				And we've got too much government and too much spending and the government is -- the size of government has grown by 40 percent in the last eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	11356				This is a race between the Vice President and myself for the presidency of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	11357				But younger workers, in order to make sure the system exists tomorrow, younger workers ought to be able to take some of your own money and invest it in safe securities to get a better rate of return on that money.	0
ClaimBuster	11358				And then we made it plain, a second phase, take up the submarine-launched or the airborne missiles.	1
ClaimBuster	11359				We are sitting on a ticking time bomb folks, because we have totally mismanaged our country, and we had better get it back under control.	0
ClaimBuster	11360				So what that means is that we can't simply drill our way out of the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	11361				I believe that many of the things they have done are evil in any concept of morality that we have.	0
ClaimBuster	11362				"It isn't enough for him to say ""I support the President's position, that I voted for the resolution."""	0
ClaimBuster	11363				And let me add the word safety; it must be done with the utmost of safety.	0
ClaimBuster	11364				Everybody who pays taxes ought to get some relief.	0
ClaimBuster	11365				I think we ought to be looking at modernization, I think we ought to be exploring less expensive ways to get it on land, and we ought to make sure that we have an effective and strong and credible nuclear deterrent.	0
ClaimBuster	11366				I've been involved myself in negotiating and helping to move along the negotiations with the Internet service providers to get a parents' protection page every time 95% of the pages come up.	1
ClaimBuster	11367				We've got seven and a half million people out of jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	11368				And believe me, this country thinks it's -- really thinks it's disgraceful, also.	0
ClaimBuster	11369				And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	11370				All I say is this.	0
ClaimBuster	11371				Bill and that allowed him to go to college, that wasn't a handout.	1
ClaimBuster	11372				Morton, I did criticize the President because of our undercutting of what was a stalwart ally -- the Shah of Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	11373				I would pick somebody who would not allow their personal opinion to get in the way of the law.	0
ClaimBuster	11374				I am not going to commit US forces until I know what the mission is, till the military tell me that it can be completed, and till I know how they can come out.	0
ClaimBuster	11375				And Iran now is more dangerous, and so is North Korea, with nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	11376				And there are folks out there who've been struggling before this crisis took place.	1
ClaimBuster	11377				People look to the President of the United States more than any other person in America.	0
ClaimBuster	11378				Now looking to what we ought to do in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	11379				I think this is the wrong direction.	0
ClaimBuster	11380				We've got to do it in a responsible way by cutting out spending we don't need, but also asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more.	0
ClaimBuster	11381				So that is where my income limit would trigger.	0
ClaimBuster	11382				But we can't kill our way out of this mess.	0
ClaimBuster	11383				And we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have.	0
ClaimBuster	11384				Look, Dr. Kissinger did not say that he would approve of face-to- face meetings between the president of the United States and the president -- and Ahmadinejad.	1
ClaimBuster	11385				And then, as we build up our national security, to restore our margin of safety, we at the same time try to restrain the Soviet build-up, which has been going forward at a rapid pace, and for quite some time.	1
ClaimBuster	11386				So, you know, she shouldn't be talking about that.	0
ClaimBuster	11387				He's got four times the size of the deficits that Mr. Nixon even had himself.	1
ClaimBuster	11388				I don't think it's a good thing.	0
ClaimBuster	11389				Now, that runs counter to what the United States of America is all about at our core.	0
ClaimBuster	11390				What we did in a legislature 87 percent Democrat, we worked together; 200 legislators in my legislature, only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished.	1
ClaimBuster	11391				And that's why the plan that I've put forward for manufacturing and education, and reducing our deficit in a sensible way, using the savings from ending wars, to rebuild America and putting people back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	11392				She didn't even know what that word -- what that letter meant.	0
ClaimBuster	11393				I never thought I'd ever be involved in anything like this.	0
ClaimBuster	11394				You're judged by the entire record.	0
ClaimBuster	11395				I don't like to see the country's principles violated.	0
ClaimBuster	11396				And this is the greatest country on Earth.	0
ClaimBuster	11397				But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he's offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there's no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who's got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	11398				And I want to go through the federal budget line by line, page by page, programs that don't work, we should cut.	0
ClaimBuster	11399				Well, thank you for the question.	0
ClaimBuster	11400				There isn't a single American diplomatic representative in any of those six.	1
ClaimBuster	11401				I think she's a terrific person...	0
ClaimBuster	11402				You went out and tried to cut $20 billion out of Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	11403				This is because younger people might be able to get health insurance for $5,000, young and healthy folks.	1
ClaimBuster	11404				What I don't accept is demonstrating and organizing demonstrations in a foreign country when your country's at war.	0
ClaimBuster	11405				By the way, when I'm subcommittee chairman, we take up the issues under my subcommittee.	0
ClaimBuster	11406				... that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race.	1
ClaimBuster	11407				(Laughter) And so our America 2000 program also says this.	0
ClaimBuster	11408				He has been watching ads of Senator McCain's.	1
ClaimBuster	11409				We don't have to be an adversary in any way, shape or form.	0
ClaimBuster	11410				The third thing I would say -- it doesn't bear directly on gun control, but it's very important -- we need more police on the street.	0
ClaimBuster	11411				We were on one side; they were on the other side.	1
ClaimBuster	11412				Their families care deeply about them, want them back and understandably so and we want to do everything we can to bring them back.	0
ClaimBuster	11413				I think it shows the difference between the two parties.	0
ClaimBuster	11414				And I won't do one other thing that he's had to do: took $29 million out of his state pension fund that's equivalent at the federal level of taking out of the Social Security trust fund.	1
ClaimBuster	11415				Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries.	0
ClaimBuster	11416				We opened a great opportunity in l972, which has pretty well been frittered - frit- frittered away under Mr. Ford, that ought to be a constant uh - inclination toward - uh - toward friendship.	0
ClaimBuster	11417				My plan is to bring down rates, but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people working.	0
ClaimBuster	11418				That's how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	11419				And we're of course going to have to consider the costs.	0
ClaimBuster	11420				But I do think this, that the next president, even within a relatively stable budget and that's what we are going to have for the foreseeable future will have to make those tough choices that I was talking about and that Mr. Bush doesn't seem to want to make.	0
ClaimBuster	11421				The future will be the greatest time in this country's history if we can beat this division that is bedeviling the whole rest of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	11422				Well, I hope I made my answer clear.	0
ClaimBuster	11423				And that would permit us to deal with the developing nations in a position of strength.	0
ClaimBuster	11424				I propose a real prescription drug benefit under Medicare for all seniors, all seniors, and here's how it works.	0
ClaimBuster	11425				So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested -- a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago, suggested that we appoint a commission.	1
ClaimBuster	11426				You don't measure it by a percentage increase.	0
ClaimBuster	11427				Same with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	11428				There is more oil now, in the wells that have been drilled, than has been taken out in 121 years that they've been drilled.	1
ClaimBuster	11429				I do know what he has said about mine.	1
ClaimBuster	11430				There will be a job-sucking sound going south.	0
ClaimBuster	11431				We rank first in the country in job growth, we got the lowest spending, state and local, in the country, and the 2nd lowest tax burden.	1
ClaimBuster	11432				There's not a more important issue.	0
ClaimBuster	11433				And three-quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people.	1
ClaimBuster	11434				Well, let me just say -- let me just say.	0
ClaimBuster	11435				And they've done a wonderful job, and they've been wonderful, wonderful kids.	0
ClaimBuster	11436				I want to change those provisions.	0
ClaimBuster	11437				There is social, economic progress, and a strategy, a strategy of going into an area, clearing and holding, and the people of the country then become allied with you.	0
ClaimBuster	11438				We agree on a couple of things on education.	1
ClaimBuster	11439				And the president chose the wrong way.	0
ClaimBuster	11440				We need a hundred thousand more police on the street.	0
ClaimBuster	11441				And that would relieve an enormous amount of pressure.	0
ClaimBuster	11442				First of all, although we are today, as Senator Kennedy has admitted, the strongest nation in the world militarily, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have - if the should launch a surprise attack - we will be able to destroy their war-making capability.	1
ClaimBuster	11443				Let me go back a minute to racial divisiveness.	0
ClaimBuster	11444				There is a difference with what the president did in Kosovo which I supported and this.	1
ClaimBuster	11445				In the last five pres- vice presidential uh - nominees, uh - incumbents, three of them have become president.	1
ClaimBuster	11446				They'll never be the same.	0
ClaimBuster	11447				Now with regard to Cuba, let me make one thing clear.	0
ClaimBuster	11448				We've got to join with the British and the French, with the Germans, who've been involved, in their initiative.	1
ClaimBuster	11449				The Vice President is right, by the way.	0
ClaimBuster	11450				Now those are the wrong priorities.	0
ClaimBuster	11451				I would hope that as we move to one area of the world from another - and the United States must not spread itself too thinly - that was one of the problems that helped to create the circumstances in Vietnam - but as we as a nation find that we are asked by the various parties, either one nation against another or individuals within a nation, that the United States will take the leadership and try to resolve the differences.	0
ClaimBuster	11452				And I believe that instead of talking about Soviet progress, we can talk about American successes.	0
ClaimBuster	11453				Actually, I understand it pretty well.	0
ClaimBuster	11454				I was the floor manager.	1
ClaimBuster	11455				Surely we can send 5% back to you that pay the bills.	0
ClaimBuster	11456				If you pay any tax at all, you got tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	11457				That is an outrageous claim.	0
ClaimBuster	11458				Every debate I bring this up, and nobody ever addresses it.	1
ClaimBuster	11459				If we had that many more people in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and Marines, our unemployment figure would be considerably less.	0
ClaimBuster	11460				As a matter of fact, I brought Republicans and Democrats together to do just that in the State of Texas to get a patient's bill of rights through.	1
ClaimBuster	11461				One I don't have a list yet.	0
ClaimBuster	11462				And I'm going to spend what it takes to win the war, more than just $120 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	11463				It's called the automated check or the instant check.	1
ClaimBuster	11464				No HMO or insurance company can take those choices away from you.	0
ClaimBuster	11465				And if you think I was proud of it, I think you misread me, I do.	0
ClaimBuster	11466				First of all, we hear that our prestige is at an all-time low.	0
ClaimBuster	11467				Now, Social Security has never done that.	1
ClaimBuster	11468				We want -- we want to make sure that we're seeing progress throughout the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	11469				First, we ought to prevent more of this on the street.	0
ClaimBuster	11470				We find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	11471				Governor Carter uh - apparently doesn't realize that since I've been president we have sold to the Israelis over $4 billion in military hardware.	1
ClaimBuster	11472				But I think that it's important to recognize that there are things that can be done short of that, and that we do have interests there.	0
ClaimBuster	11473				We're spending $1 billion to come up with the technologies to do that.	1
ClaimBuster	11474				And they're showing up in Iraq for the same reason.	0
ClaimBuster	11475				Well, I try to articulate my positions as clearly as possible, tell people what I stand for and let them decide whether they're going to support me or not.	0
ClaimBuster	11476				But let's look at the facts here.	0
ClaimBuster	11477				From 50,000 down, those people paid two-thirds of the taxes, and those people got two-thirds of the tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	11478				We need to deal with managed care.	0
ClaimBuster	11479				It would be catastrophic if the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board became the tool of the political uh - party that was in power.	0
ClaimBuster	11480				We need to know the full extent of Senator Obama's relationship with ACORN, who is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy.	1
ClaimBuster	11481				And so does Michael Feinberg.	0
ClaimBuster	11482				It helped lead me through a war, leads me today.	0
ClaimBuster	11483				Drug counselors out there in the street who are providing help to youngsters who come up to me and others who ask for help and want help, are doing the hard work, the heroic work, which it takes to provide that kind of leadership, that kind of counseling, that kind of support.	1
ClaimBuster	11484				What's he say to Alexander Kwasniewski of Poland?	0
ClaimBuster	11485				We need to restore the faith and the trust of the American people in their own government.	0
ClaimBuster	11486				And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow.	0
ClaimBuster	11487				"I -- well, maybe they say, ""Well, it was a youthful indiscretion."""	0
ClaimBuster	11488				She never got a college education, even though she was smart as a whip.	1
ClaimBuster	11489				You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country.	1
ClaimBuster	11490				What we do in this country, the kind of society that we build, that will tell whether freedom will be sustained around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	11491				I'm just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election, but that's how Donald thinks.	0
ClaimBuster	11492				We don't have to settle for, how many months, 43 months with unemployment above 8 percent, 23 million Americans struggling to find a good job right now.	1
ClaimBuster	11493				Yes, and I'm certain many, many Americans were turned off by the revelations of Watergate, a very, very uh - bad period of time in American political history.	0
ClaimBuster	11494				So we're making dramatic progress.	0
ClaimBuster	11495				You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good.	0
ClaimBuster	11496				Ultimately, the most serious terrorist threat is if one of those radical nations, who believe in terrorism as a policy, should have atomic weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	11497				That's what this race is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	11498				If we do those things, we can build that bridge to the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	11499				I think our Cabinet members are key people.	0
ClaimBuster	11500				She won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name.	0
ClaimBuster	11501				I think the essential strategy of the United States ought not accept any Soviet control over Eastern Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	11502				"I don't want to see the kiddie pornographic laws repealed; I don't want to see ""under God"" come out from our currency."	0
ClaimBuster	11503				If you've got health care already, and probably the majority of you do, then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it.	0
ClaimBuster	11504				Incomes went up for everybody.	1
ClaimBuster	11505				We need to rebuild our alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	11506				He had bilateral talks with the North Koreans.	1
ClaimBuster	11507				Let's go back in terms of accepting responsibility for your actions.	0
ClaimBuster	11508				It was wrong for the country and calling it conservative won't make it right.	0
ClaimBuster	11509				Don't talk about growth, because even though we need growth, that's not helping.	0
ClaimBuster	11510				Because the problem in America today to a large extent, Tom, is that we don't have trust and confidence in our institutions because of the corruption on Wall Street and the greed and excess and the cronyism in Washington, D.C.	1
ClaimBuster	11511				I signed a bill to stop these drive-by deliveries when insurance companies can force people out of the hospital after 24 hours and I vetoed Senator Dole's Medicare plan that would have forced a lot of seniors into managed care and taken a lot more money out of their pockets and led to Medicare withering on the vine.	1
ClaimBuster	11512				I few have experience and now how to handle it, but please do not go back to the days when the military was as weak as they could be, when the morale was down, and when we were the laughing stock around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	11513				It is time to have a new commander in chief who will rebuild the military, pay our men and women more, make sure they're housed better and have a focused mission for our military.	0
ClaimBuster	11514				Because we cut taxes on everybody -- remember, we ran up the child credit by $1,000, we reduced the marriage penalty, we created a 10 percent bracket, everybody who pays taxes got relief -- the recession was one of the shortest in our nation's history.	1
ClaimBuster	11515				And I didn't wilt and I didn't quit.	1
ClaimBuster	11516				And here I believe basically that what we have to do is to stimulate that sector of America, the private enterprise sector of the economy, in which there is the greatest possibility for expansion.	0
ClaimBuster	11517				He said, no, she has leukemia, acute leukemia, a few weeks to live.	1
ClaimBuster	11518				And the reason is, because I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well.	0
ClaimBuster	11519				Or do you just keep lunging in at will?	0
ClaimBuster	11520				We don't want to overreact, as the federal regulators have in my judgment, on good banks so that they've created credit crunches, that is, they have made our recession worse in the last couple of years -- but we do want to act prudently with the banks that are in trouble.	1
ClaimBuster	11521				As I said the other night, I hope a lot of them lose because they're liberal Democrats --	0
ClaimBuster	11522				In my opinion this is the same kind of woolly thinking that led to disaster for America in Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	11523				Vladimir is going to have to make some hard choices.	0
ClaimBuster	11524				He said I want to take it from the rich, raise $150 billion from the rich.	1
ClaimBuster	11525				Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims.	0
ClaimBuster	11526				The 50 governors of this nation have proposed to the Congress that we help those families to get off of welfare, help those youngsters, help their mothers to become independent and self-sufficient.	1
ClaimBuster	11527				He has vetoed bills passed by Congress within the congressional budget guidelines job opportunities for two million Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	11528				But let me tell you, you know, this business about bombing Iran and all that, let me tell you my record.	0
ClaimBuster	11529				Now whether or not he'll do that again I've heard some of the people say, well, that's the model we ought to use and if he's reelected maybe he will come back and try it again.	0
ClaimBuster	11530				We had family leave in our office, I'm certain.	1
ClaimBuster	11531				Now, I've outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement at home and abroad, doubling the number of drug enforcement agents, having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th of January when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together.	1
ClaimBuster	11532				You said that we should still have troops in Iraq to this day.	1
ClaimBuster	11533				And let me explain why.	0
ClaimBuster	11534				So to answer your question, I support, I guess the way to put it, is affirmative access.	0
ClaimBuster	11535				I had something very nice to say in there.	0
ClaimBuster	11536				Let me see where to start here.	0
ClaimBuster	11537				I think something this big, this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis.	0
ClaimBuster	11538				Very early in my administration I proposed -- and I think something that had never been proposed by any previous administration -- I proposed a total elimination of intermediate-range missiles, where the Soviets had better than a 10 -- and still have -- better than a 10-to-1 advantage over the allies in Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	11539				Houston has just become the smoggiest city in the country.	1
ClaimBuster	11540				Our initial military success, we went in to Baghdad and everybody celebrated.	0
ClaimBuster	11541				Well, that vote wasn't exactly -- a lot of the supporters of the Kyoto Treaty actually ended up voting for that because the way it was worded.	1
ClaimBuster	11542				And I'm certainly not going to say to him, I'll give you more flexibility after the election.	0
ClaimBuster	11543				We need to cut the business tax rate in America.	0
ClaimBuster	11544				Syria is Russia and it's Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly.	0
ClaimBuster	11545				Well, keep in mind our strategy wasn't just going after bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	11546				Because -- because this is important.	0
ClaimBuster	11547				Of course it's on the table.	0
ClaimBuster	11548				There has never been a country on Earth that saw its economy decline and yet maintained its military superiority.	1
ClaimBuster	11549				"Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is ""Make America Great Again,"" I wonder when he thought America was great."	1
ClaimBuster	11550				And as for the surest way to threaten our prosperity, having a $1.9 trillion tax cut, almost half of which goes to the wealthy, and a $1 trillion Social Security privatization proposal is the surest way to put our budget into deficit √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì raise interest rates and put our prosperity at risk.	1
ClaimBuster	11551				Expediting drugs through the FDA makes sense, of course.	0
ClaimBuster	11552				On the north they have North Korea with five hundred thousand well-trained, well-equipped troops - they are supported by the People's Republic of China; they are supported by the Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	11553				There is a problem for our youngsters, a real problem.	0
ClaimBuster	11554				One of the major responsibilities on the shoulders of uh - New York City is to - is to finance welfare.	1
ClaimBuster	11555				These are people that kill women and treat women horribly.	1
ClaimBuster	11556				And we must do whatever we can to prevent genocide, whatever we can to prevent these terrible calamities that we have said never again.	0
ClaimBuster	11557				And uh - it would be of - of tremendous benefit in long-range planning, in tight budgeting, uh saving the taxpayers' money, making the government more efficient, cutting down on bureaucratic waste, having a clear delineation of authority and responsibility of employees, and giving our people a better chance to understand and control their government.	0
ClaimBuster	11558				We are a government by the people, and when we move, it should be for very severe and extreme reasons that serve our national interests and end up with a stronger country behind us.	0
ClaimBuster	11559				We, of course, don't want to have automatic weapons, and that's already illegal in this country to have automatic weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	11560				But we're always also going to have to maintain vigilance when it comes to terrorist activities.	0
ClaimBuster	11561				I wouldn't have supported either.	0
ClaimBuster	11562				Syria -- Syria's not just a tragedy of 30,000 civilians being killed by a military, but also a strategic -- strategically significant player for America.	1
ClaimBuster	11563				We've come through a recession, a stock market decline, an attack on our country.	1
ClaimBuster	11564				We don't have to settle for 50 percent of kids coming out of college not able to get work.	1
ClaimBuster	11565				I wouldn't relish doing it but I wouldn't shrink from it.	0
ClaimBuster	11566				I've also advocated that we stop the sale by Germany and France of - processing plants for Pakistan and Brazil.	1
ClaimBuster	11567				Well, Jim, the FDA took 12 years, and I do support that decision.	1
ClaimBuster	11568				Going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today.	0
ClaimBuster	11569				Surely we can work together to create a cultural life so some of these youngsters who feel like they can take a neighbor's life with a gun will understand that that's not the way America is meant to be.	0
ClaimBuster	11570				See, I think you can be realistic and optimistic at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	11571				I'm for an investment tax allowance; I'm for a tax break for first- time homebuyers.	0
ClaimBuster	11572				I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience.	0
ClaimBuster	11573				I mean, women know what's it like to be paid an unequal amount for equal work.	0
ClaimBuster	11574				And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they're doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business.	0
ClaimBuster	11575				He voted for the energy bill that was full of goodies for the oil companies that I opposed.	1
ClaimBuster	11576				I'd be honored and humbled.	0
ClaimBuster	11577				Well, I have to respond.	0
ClaimBuster	11578				And I know the president will join me in welcoming all of Florida to this debate.	0
ClaimBuster	11579				I thought the Oregon plan should at least have been allowed to be tried because at least the people in Oregon were trying to do something.	0
ClaimBuster	11580				The second, you've got your big companies that are in trouble, including the defense industries--have another one on that.	0
ClaimBuster	11581				You've set up a Strategic Defense Initiative, an agency, you're beginning to test, you're talking about deploying, you're asking for a budget of some $30 billion for this purpose.	1
ClaimBuster	11582				And so, look, I'm going to -- what you need to know about me is I will uphold the law, I'm going to have an attorney general that enforces the law.	0
ClaimBuster	11583				We need to help the Pakistani government go into Waziristan, where I visited, a very rough country, and -- and get the support of the people, and get them to work with us and turn against the cruel Taliban and others.	1
ClaimBuster	11584				I don't think it's possible for Mr. Nixon to state the record in distortion of the facts with more precision than he just did.	0
ClaimBuster	11585				A President must know the essential facts essential to command.	0
ClaimBuster	11586				There is going to be hundreds of experiments off the 22 lines that now exist that are active, and hopefully we find a cure.	1
ClaimBuster	11587				That's called business, by the way.	0
ClaimBuster	11588				They're not going to be solved overnight.	0
ClaimBuster	11589				He's been in the United States Senate for 20 years and he hasn't addressed it.	1
ClaimBuster	11590				I believe that the opposite is true with President Ford's campaign, and uh - I hope that we can leave those issues in this next ten days about personalities and mistakes of the past - we've both made some mistakes - and talk about unemployment, inflation, housing, education, taxation, government organization, stripping away of secrecy, and the things that are crucial to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	11591				A little experience, a little age, a little intelligence.	0
ClaimBuster	11592				We'll have an opportunity to see the two of them in action in a friendly forum, wonderful friendly fashion like this.	0
ClaimBuster	11593				Now so that we get it absolutely clear: Senator Kennedy must as a candidate - as I as a candidate in fifty-two - criticize us when we're wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	11594				Is the behavior you're using prone to cause AIDS?	0
ClaimBuster	11595				26 days from today you and millions of Americans will choose two people to lead us into the future as president and vice president of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	11596				It could reduce Saddam Hussein's abilities to threaten Kuwait and his other neighbors again.	0
ClaimBuster	11597				People are pouring into our country, and they're coming in from the Middle East and other places.	1
ClaimBuster	11598				And when you look at what you are proposing...	0
ClaimBuster	11599				Bob, let me just respond.	0
ClaimBuster	11600				Now, just a comment on Senator Kennedy's last answer.	0
ClaimBuster	11601				In order to make sure people have jobs for the 21st century, we've got to get it right in the education system, and we're beginning to close a minority achievement gap now.	0
ClaimBuster	11602				It's not going to happen on its own.	0
ClaimBuster	11603				We're going to ask you to show us whether or not -- we ask you to post the results on the Internet.	0
ClaimBuster	11604				If you take it out of the surplus in the trust fund, that means the trust fund goes bankrupt in this generation within 20 years.	1
ClaimBuster	11605				We have considered inflation in our figures.	1
ClaimBuster	11606				The measurement is not: Are we safer?	0
ClaimBuster	11607				I'm going to let him keep his wealth.	0
ClaimBuster	11608				And I've heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there's been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims.	1
ClaimBuster	11609				Now on the question of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, I must say that I feel that another effort should be made by a new Administration in January of 1961, to renew negotiations with the Soviet Union and see whether it's possible to come to some conclusion which will lessen the chances of contamination of the atmosphere, and also lessen the chances that other powers will begin to possess a nuclear capacity.	0
ClaimBuster	11610				"I was in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm and she said, ""I've been out of work since May."	1
ClaimBuster	11611				Has made him a part of our foreign policy and has been funneling aid to Contras through convicted drug dealers.√É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬∞√Ç¬§	1
ClaimBuster	11612				I strongly support local control, so does Governor Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	11613				But for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring.	0
ClaimBuster	11614				In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself.	0
ClaimBuster	11615				Am I wrong about that?	0
ClaimBuster	11616				I'm really excited about getting it done, too.	0
ClaimBuster	11617				And the way we're going to get it done is we're going to have a brand new Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	11618				We have to bet on the future and move beyond the current technologies to have a whole new generation of more efficient, cleaner, energy technology.	0
ClaimBuster	11619				When the original treaty was signed back in the early 1900s, when Theodore Roosevelt was president, Panama retained sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone.	1
ClaimBuster	11620				... to -- to -- to...	0
ClaimBuster	11621				That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	11622				Again and again and again, the mother disappears in 3 days, and the child becomes a ward of the state because he's permanently and genetically damaged.	0
ClaimBuster	11623				We'll deny sanctuary to these terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	11624				One of the biggest problems today is that the countries to our south are so desperately poor that these people who will almost lose their lives if they don't come north, come north despite all the risks.	0
ClaimBuster	11625				He also indicates as far as his agricultural program is concerned that he feels it will cost less than ours.	1
ClaimBuster	11626				And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years I've been in public service.	1
ClaimBuster	11627				There will be no unilateral disarmament under my administration.	0
ClaimBuster	11628				I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	11629				And I've never seen a presidential campaign where the presidential nominee runs against my vice presidential nominee; never seen one before.	0
ClaimBuster	11630				I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession.	0
ClaimBuster	11631				Now, I have a basic disagreement with Senator Kennedy, though, on this point.	0
ClaimBuster	11632				I'm using the same words that your advisers use.	0
ClaimBuster	11633				But, you know, it's gotten to be about $122 difference.	1
ClaimBuster	11634				There are 200,000 people unemployed in California alone because we have cut defense without planning to retrain them and to reinvest in the technologies of the future here at home.	1
ClaimBuster	11635				Now, just because we don't want to get involved everywhere doesn't mean we should back off anywhere it comes up.	0
ClaimBuster	11636				Those things would revolutionize American education and take us to the top economically.	0
ClaimBuster	11637				Because the trillion dollars that has been promised to young people has also been promised to older people.	1
ClaimBuster	11638				You talk about the Brady Bill.	0
ClaimBuster	11639				And I -- I don't blame the administration for the fact that the relationship with Pakistan is strained.	1
ClaimBuster	11640				There's only one way out of this, and that is to stop the deterioration of our job base, to have a growing, expanding job base, to give us the tax base -- see, balancing the budget is not nearly as difficult as paying off the $4 trillion debt and leaving our children the American dream intact.	0
ClaimBuster	11641				Well, It seems to me that uh - we have a chance - the Republicans - to get a majority in the House of Representatives.	0
ClaimBuster	11642				Because that's the way we elect a president in this country, and it's the way we should.	0
ClaimBuster	11643				Because I understand the stakes of this war on terror.	0
ClaimBuster	11644				They look at the fact that we owe 'em a trillion dollars and owe other people $16 trillion in total, including that.	1
ClaimBuster	11645				I talked to an African-American police officer in Springfield, Massachusetts not long ago who raised this question and said that in his opinion one of the biggest solutions is in the training.	1
ClaimBuster	11646				He believes, like I believe, that the Iraqis are ready to fight for their own freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	11647				Let me give you the example of Mexico.	0
ClaimBuster	11648				Small businesses are not going to have a mandate.	0
ClaimBuster	11649				So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	11650				Secondly, I think that the Burger Court has fairly well confirmed the major and - and most far-reaching and most controversial decisions of the Warren Court.	0
ClaimBuster	11651				In other words, we've had a huge increase of about $.50 a gallon since that time, and all of that increase has gone out of this country - or much of it - into the pockets of OPEC oil producers.	1
ClaimBuster	11652				That will help us maintain the kind of American leadership that we need.	0
ClaimBuster	11653				And this particular bill, it allows patients to choose a doctor, their own doctor if they want to.	1
ClaimBuster	11654				And when it comes to tightening sanctions, look, as I said before, we've put in the toughest, most crippling sanctions ever.	1
ClaimBuster	11655				I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be allowed to protect themselves and their families.	0
ClaimBuster	11656				I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion in a deal for an Air Force tanker that was done in a corrupt fashion.	1
ClaimBuster	11657				I want to keep this economic recovery going.	0
ClaimBuster	11658				We're going to be able to.	0
ClaimBuster	11659				So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS.	1
ClaimBuster	11660				Now, I can only say this.	0
ClaimBuster	11661				Quotas are bad for America.	0
ClaimBuster	11662				How much for my family?	0
ClaimBuster	11663				But I've got confidence in my country.	0
ClaimBuster	11664				I wanted to make it more effective and efficient.	0
ClaimBuster	11665				And I think there has to be -- I think Mr. Perot and I agree on this, there has to be a national commission of health care providers and health care consumers that set ceilings to keep health costs in line with inflation, plus population growth.	0
ClaimBuster	11666				Now that isn't the test of whether America moves.	0
ClaimBuster	11667				I will not agree to another debate.	0
ClaimBuster	11668				I think if you really believe that the people of a state ought to make a decision on a matter of this kind that uh - we ought to have a federal constitutional amendment that would permit each one of the fifty states to make the choice.	0
ClaimBuster	11669				And Mr. Bush is right - the two go hand in hand.	0
ClaimBuster	11670				"The Communists say, ""Come with us; look what we've done."""	1
ClaimBuster	11671				And this is your plan, John.	0
ClaimBuster	11672				And, in fact, we just found out that AIG, a company that got a bailout, just a week after they got help went on a $400,000 junket.	1
ClaimBuster	11673				And I -- and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan, he's -- some ideas he's put forward on Race to the Top, not all of them, but some of them I agree with and -- and congratulate him for pursuing that.	0
ClaimBuster	11674				It's your strength, it's your values, it's the quality of the people you pick.	0
ClaimBuster	11675				He declared the need for a new tax cut for the oil companies in Texas an emergency need, and so the money was taken away from the CHIP program.	1
ClaimBuster	11676				I think there're several reasons.	0
ClaimBuster	11677				But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	11678				For years, she had been getting paid less than a man had been paid for doing the exact same job.	1
ClaimBuster	11679				We still have them on, on some things.	1
ClaimBuster	11680				But I don't think the IMF ought to be a stop loss for people who ought to be able to evaluate risks themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	11681				Airplane hijacking was one of the elements of that commitment.	1
ClaimBuster	11682				We provide for managed competition, not government models, in every states.	0
ClaimBuster	11683				We -- we make decisions today in the military that -- that will confront challenges we can't imagine.	0
ClaimBuster	11684				We're going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital.	0
ClaimBuster	11685				Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries.	1
ClaimBuster	11686				About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they're going to attack Mosul.	1
ClaimBuster	11687				Benefits were not affected at all.	1
ClaimBuster	11688				And uh - the Playboy thing has been of great - very great concern to me.	0
ClaimBuster	11689				We went to the UN, we made historic resolutions up there, the whole world was united, our Congress was dragging its feet.	1
ClaimBuster	11690				We passed 100,000 police, the assault weapons ban, the Brady Bill.	1
ClaimBuster	11691				I know my own view is I'd rather have a private plan.	0
ClaimBuster	11692				Well, we, the living Americans, have gone through four wars.	1
ClaimBuster	11693				We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag.	1
ClaimBuster	11694				Let me tell you a little what it's like to be president.	0
ClaimBuster	11695				Well, here we go again.	0
ClaimBuster	11696				And we're now in a position where we can transition out, because there's no reason why Americans should die when Afghans are perfectly capable of defending their own country.	1
ClaimBuster	11697				I have a little foundation for the disabled called the Dole Foundation.	1
ClaimBuster	11698				In Longview, Texas the other day, I met a woman who was almost in tears because she had been able to keep her job while spending time with her husband who had cancer.	1
ClaimBuster	11699				He talks about economic growth as a great indicator of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	11700				And you can't convert from potato chips to airplanes in an emergency.	0
ClaimBuster	11701				Now, you don't do that.	0
ClaimBuster	11702				What happens in those forests, because of lousy federal policy, is they grow to be -- they are not -- they're not harvested.	1
ClaimBuster	11703				It's putting a hair-trigger on nuclear war.	0
ClaimBuster	11704				I didn't hear any plan to fix Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	11705				I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years.	1
ClaimBuster	11706				Can we become a breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world?	0
ClaimBuster	11707				But suppose we came up with that?	0
ClaimBuster	11708				Whether or not our forces were of high morale and high standing and well-equipped.	0
ClaimBuster	11709				But I'm most concerned about the whole problem of the spread of atomic weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	11710				I'm sure there are hundreds of others.	0
ClaimBuster	11711				But it's because I see this -- we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth.	0
ClaimBuster	11712				We're talking about six percentage points over six years, and with that money you give it back to the working people.	1
ClaimBuster	11713				Boy, great question and important question, because you're absolutely right.	0
ClaimBuster	11714				You know, in the last, or two decades ago, it was routine for leaders of foreign countries to come over here and say you guys have got to do something about these horrendous deficits because it's causing tremendous problems for the rest of the world, and we were lectured to all the time.	1
ClaimBuster	11715				Strong relations in Europe is in our nation's interest.	0
ClaimBuster	11716				And what they want is the ability to just focus on some really big challenges that we face right now, and that's what I have been trying to focus on this entire campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	11717				But there are always going to be elements in these countries that potentially threaten the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	11718				Now, either he's going to break all these wonderful promises he's told you about or he's going to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	11719				And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can't bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so bad.	1
ClaimBuster	11720				"It would be the highest honor for me to have your support on November second and for you to say, ""Jerry Ford, you've done a good job, keep on doing it."""	0
ClaimBuster	11721				But now we've got a very good concept called competitive strategies.	0
ClaimBuster	11722				Kids go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war.	0
ClaimBuster	11723				First time they've ever endorsed a candidate.	1
ClaimBuster	11724				I don't think it provides effective governmental controls.	0
ClaimBuster	11725				Because we are first in the world in space, as I've indicated; we are first in science; we are first in education, and we're going to move even further ahead with the kind of leadership that we can provide in these years ahead.	1
ClaimBuster	11726				But I'll tell you something, I'm proud that people who are 30 years old and 40 years old now have someone in their generation that is going to be vice president of the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	11727				You've been all over the country repeating something that, I will admit, the press has also been repeating -- that I believed that nuclear missiles could be fired and then called back.	1
ClaimBuster	11728				A shameless plug there, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	11729				I did to because I too hope that we'll discover cures from the stem cells and from the research derived.	0
ClaimBuster	11730				When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax.	1
ClaimBuster	11731				But I think anybody who wears a uniform is a great American.	0
ClaimBuster	11732				Somebody who would come to me if somebody came up with a crazy idea that we ought to trade arms to the Ayatollah for hostages and say, √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬∞√Ç¬•Mr.	0
ClaimBuster	11733				Let's do a lot of things to impose efficiencies.	0
ClaimBuster	11734				What I do think should be done, once they are safely here with their families, and that tragedy is over - we've endured this humiliation for just lacking one week of a year now - then, I think, it is time for us to have a complete investigation as to the diplomatic efforts that were made in the beginning, why they have been there so long, and when they came home, what did we have to do in order to bring that about - what arrangements were made?	0
ClaimBuster	11735				And I hear from my farmers and friends all the time.	1
ClaimBuster	11736				I think if you're going to have tax relief, everybody ought to get it.	0
ClaimBuster	11737				I think you know better.	0
ClaimBuster	11738				Where did you find this?	0
ClaimBuster	11739				Why should they be rifling through your files?	0
ClaimBuster	11740				The trial lawyers, big supporters of the president.	1
ClaimBuster	11741				But if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn't be so bad.	0
ClaimBuster	11742				I wanted to hitchhike a ride home in his tank with him.	0
ClaimBuster	11743				I think we ought to restore the three-day waiting period under the Brady Law.	0
ClaimBuster	11744				Millions and millions of people at work.	1
ClaimBuster	11745				A lot of questions are first impression, and these questions that have been seen many times come up in a new context and so -- but, you know, this is a very important issue.	0
ClaimBuster	11746				Let's have community health centers.	0
ClaimBuster	11747				So the net tax increase in his plan's somewhere between 60 and 80 billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	11748				Maybe we can work it out.	0
ClaimBuster	11749				I would support an effort to ban corporate soft money and labor union soft money so long as there was dues check-off.	0
ClaimBuster	11750				You should have changed the law.	0
ClaimBuster	11751				It's not my term, it's the president's own secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating.	1
ClaimBuster	11752				In addition to that, the money that I raise from upper-income people and from asking foreign corporations just to pay the same income on their income earned in America that American corporations do will be used to give incentives back to upper-income people.	0
ClaimBuster	11753				Let me help the governor.	0
ClaimBuster	11754				public reports not long ago about ships that could not leave American ports because of a lack of crews.	1
ClaimBuster	11755				"Windows smashed out, painted on one of them ""Unkept promises;"" on another, ""Despair."""	1
ClaimBuster	11756				To get the interest rates down.	0
ClaimBuster	11757				Number three, the Vice President - on May fifteenth after the U-2 flight - indicated that the flights were going on, even though the Administration and the President had canceled the flights on May twelfth.	1
ClaimBuster	11758				Of course, and that again -- no, I think that that was ill-considered.	0
ClaimBuster	11759				That's-at least that's what I read.	0
ClaimBuster	11760				If I'm interested in figuring out my foreign policy, I associate myself with my running mate, Joe Biden or with Dick Lugar, the Republican ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, or General Jim Jones, the former supreme allied commander of NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	11761				We wish you a lot of luck.	0
ClaimBuster	11762				They just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days: $43 billion of giveaways, including favors to the oil and gas industry and the people importing ceiling fans from China.	1
ClaimBuster	11763				It's a nation that's not like -- like others and it does not have a civilian leadership that is calling the shots there.	1
ClaimBuster	11764				You know, like hair transplants, I might need one of those myself.	0
ClaimBuster	11765				That's a test of prestige.	0
ClaimBuster	11766				I'd say, several hundred of them.	1
ClaimBuster	11767				In 1957 I was in Havana.	1
ClaimBuster	11768				Senator Obama has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	11769				And I believe that's very, very important.	0
ClaimBuster	11770				One party is ready to move in these programs.	0
ClaimBuster	11771				As the result in the last uh - two years uh - we have had a responsible monetary policy.	0
ClaimBuster	11772				I'm going to stand up and fight for the American worker.	0
ClaimBuster	11773				I costed out the cost of the Democratic platform.	0
ClaimBuster	11774				China had a space launch and a space walk.	1
ClaimBuster	11775				President Clinton ran for governor in 1990 and said he's going to fill out his term, but he didn't.	1
ClaimBuster	11776				All right, I'm not going to cut education funding.	0
ClaimBuster	11777				Otherwise, with a steady rate of economic growth - and Mr. Nixon and Mr. Rockefeller, in their meeting, said a five per cent economic growth would bring by 1962 ten billion dollars extra in tax revenues.	1
ClaimBuster	11778				And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you.	0
ClaimBuster	11779				But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program.	0
ClaimBuster	11780				And -- and they're throughout many nations in the Middle East.	1
ClaimBuster	11781				It has - uh left out some that I have recommended, unfortunately.	1
ClaimBuster	11782				Well I welcome this opportunity to join Senator Kennedy completely on that statement and to say before this largest television audience in history something that I have been saying in the past and want to - will always say in the future.	1
ClaimBuster	11783				So I want to keep the quality of health care.	0
ClaimBuster	11784				It's kind of one of those exaggerations.	0
ClaimBuster	11785				You said that they could get it in the private marketplace.	1
ClaimBuster	11786				But let's get back to the core issue here.	0
ClaimBuster	11787				We got great faith in the ability of liberty to transform societies, to convert a hostile world to a peaceful world.	0
ClaimBuster	11788				And that amendment put the Senate of the United States on record with a majority of the Senator's own party voting for it, as well as the majority of Republicans - put them on record - against the very position that the Senator takes now of surrendering, of indicating in advance, that the United States will not defend the offshore islands.	1
ClaimBuster	11789				We'll continue to try to get things that we didn't get in a program that has already brought the rate of spending of government down from 17 percent to 6.1 percent, a program of returning authority and autonomy to the local and State governments that has been unjustly seized by the Federal Government.	1
ClaimBuster	11790				As a matter of fact, we have a vast range of technology and weaponry right now that provides all the bargaining chips that we need.	0
ClaimBuster	11791				But that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.	0
ClaimBuster	11792				I talk to Tony Blair all the time.	1
ClaimBuster	11793				You've got some pretty strong-willed guys up there that argue with you.	0
ClaimBuster	11794				And that tax, there are no deductions, so a person making anywhere from 10, 15, 20 -- they're paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money.	1
ClaimBuster	11795				Mr. Ayers is not involved in my campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	11796				He, himself, has said, and rightly so, that he'll be a strong Vice President.	1
ClaimBuster	11797				In the election of 1960, and with the world around us, the question is whether the world will exist half-slave or half-free, whether it will move in the direction of freedom, in the direction of the road that we are taking, or whether it will move in the direction of slavery.	0
ClaimBuster	11798				The fact that you have an agreement is one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	11799				At least we have low interest rates that the Fed can control.	0
ClaimBuster	11800				Republicans have cut 53 billion dollars in spending, that's why the budget looked good.	1
ClaimBuster	11801				It's the sunrise side, not the sunset side.	0
ClaimBuster	11802				I know it's not popular, and I understand the nature of your question.	0
ClaimBuster	11803				It hasn't been undone since I was there.	1
ClaimBuster	11804				But I think there are personal differences.	0
ClaimBuster	11805				I think the governor's instinct is not necessarily bad because we have worked with the Russians in a constructive way in Kosovo, for example, to end the conflict there.	0
ClaimBuster	11806				I do not add a penny to the national debt.	1
ClaimBuster	11807				I'd like to just respond, if I might.	0
ClaimBuster	11808				He supported it at the National Governors Conference and I supported it in breaking a tie in a major compromise package and we got assailed by the Democrats in the election over that.	1
ClaimBuster	11809				So that's one of the things that I think makes a big difference between us.	0
ClaimBuster	11810				And this was a -- this was a program of the government.	1
ClaimBuster	11811				Surely we can find common ground to reduce the number of abortions in America.	0
ClaimBuster	11812				We've seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter.	1
ClaimBuster	11813				I think that we have observed, ourselves, and have done our best to see that human rights are extended throughout the world.	0
ClaimBuster	11814				I supported it because ethnic cleansing and genocide was taking place there.	1
ClaimBuster	11815				That's what he's done when it comes to economic policies that will help working families get a leg up.	1
ClaimBuster	11816				My concerns about the senator is that, in the course of this campaign, I've been listening very carefully to what he says, and he changes positions on the war in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	11817				You said you'd cut the deficit in half.	1
ClaimBuster	11818				The question was about the Supreme Court.	1
ClaimBuster	11819				They're not going to follow somebody who says this is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time.	0
ClaimBuster	11820				In every one of these instances, the Ford administration has failed, and I hope tonight that I and Mr. Ford will have a chance to discuss the reasons for those failures.	0
ClaimBuster	11821				And manufacturers here in the U.S. making the same products can't compete.	1
ClaimBuster	11822				That the best is over.	0
ClaimBuster	11823				Some of that money ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.	1
ClaimBuster	11824				And he said at that time, in a quote, and this is a paraphrase, a freeze, that's easy.	1
ClaimBuster	11825				Why did we suddenly offer Congo three hundred students last June when they had the tremendous revolt?	0
ClaimBuster	11826				You're going to have plans...	0
ClaimBuster	11827				We've got potentially 600,000 jobs and 100 years worth of energy right beneath our feet with natural gas.	1
ClaimBuster	11828				That bill pays for these urban enterprise zones by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more.	1
ClaimBuster	11829				We've got to be tough on international terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	11830				They didn't do the planning.	0
ClaimBuster	11831				Wouldn't it be nice to be perfect?	0
ClaimBuster	11832				A lot of great single moms, single dads.	0
ClaimBuster	11833				We've also got to look to the future.	0
ClaimBuster	11834				That doesn't cost any more money.	0
ClaimBuster	11835				And I have devoted a major portion of this campaign to going across this country and looking for opportunities to go to white groups and African American groups and Latino groups and Asian American groups and say the same thing.	0
ClaimBuster	11836				The Chinese Communists expressed regrets to us over a plane incident in 1956.	1
ClaimBuster	11837				That legislation uh allegedly would help our unemployment, but uh - we all know that it would've controlled our economy, it would've added uh - ten to thirty billion dollars each year in additional expenditures by the Federal Government.	1
ClaimBuster	11838				Raise some more money, spend the money on tax incentives to have growth in the private sector, take the money from the defense cuts and reinvest it in new transportation and communications and environmental clean-up systems.	0
ClaimBuster	11839				We'll even give it to you.	0
ClaimBuster	11840				I think that the president has to be prepared to use the power of the nation when our vital interests are threatened, when our treaty commitments are at stake, when we know that something has to be done that is in the national interest, and that is a part of being president.	0
ClaimBuster	11841				Instead of a high unemployment, we have the lowest African-American and Latin American unemployment rates in history and 22 million new jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	11842				I believe there are certain principles we must find in dealing with him and his colleagues - principles, if followed, that will keep the peace and that also can extend freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	11843				Every place I go I talk about it, and I think they want it done.	0
ClaimBuster	11844				That little child needs to be loved and hugged and nurtured and made to feel special, like your children were.	0
ClaimBuster	11845				And the reason President Eisenhower's vetoes have been sustained - the reason the Congress does not send up bills to him which they think will be vetoed - is because the people and the Congress, the majority of them, know the country is behind the President.	0
ClaimBuster	11846				This is a body based in The Hague where unaccountable judges and prosecutors can pull our troops or diplomats up for trial.	1
ClaimBuster	11847				We've got to sit down together across the table.	0
ClaimBuster	11848				I worry about federalizing education if I were you.	0
ClaimBuster	11849				I felt that -- I wish we'd have had a better vision of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	11850				And their aggression in Georgia is not acceptable behavior.	0
ClaimBuster	11851				But for our children and our grandchildren, we need to have a different strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	11852				I remember one day on the floor I said now, gentlemen, let me tax your memories, and Kennedy jumped up and said, why haven't we thought of that before.	1
ClaimBuster	11853				I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida.	1
ClaimBuster	11854				Well, I think it's terrible.	0
ClaimBuster	11855				They both said they were Vietnam veterans supporting me because I had an economic program to put them back to work.	1
ClaimBuster	11856				Well, I think it's true that we shouldn't apply a strict litmus test and the most important thing in any judge is their capacity to provide fairness and justice to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	11857				A lot of us saw this train wreck coming.	0
ClaimBuster	11858				I can't tell you how lucky I am.	0
ClaimBuster	11859				He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.	1
ClaimBuster	11860				We've got to do more to get the whole economy moving, and that's what I believe I will be able to do.	0
ClaimBuster	11861				In other words, there are practical things we can do.	0
ClaimBuster	11862				Ten days before I took the oath of office as president they were 21 and a half percent.	1
ClaimBuster	11863				We've spent, so far, close to $700 billion and if we continue on the path that we're on, as Senator McCain is suggesting, it's going to go well over $1 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	11864				We've got to reduce the class size so that the student who walks in has more one-on-one time with the teacher.	0
ClaimBuster	11865				Yes, we have to succeed, and I have a better plan to help us do it.	0
ClaimBuster	11866				The people want economic reform.	0
ClaimBuster	11867				If we continue under Mr. Ford's policy by 1985 or '90 we'll have twenty nations that have the capability of exploding atomic weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	11868				Now that means recruiting new teachers for the public schools.	0
ClaimBuster	11869				One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code.	0
ClaimBuster	11870				Over time we have developed a government that comes at the people, that comes from the top down, where the people are more or less treated as objects to be programmed during the campaign with commercials and media events and fear messages and personal attacks and things of that nature.	0
ClaimBuster	11871				And because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, we've begun to fight our way back.	0
ClaimBuster	11872				Our allies - the smaller countries get trampled in the rush.	0
ClaimBuster	11873				It's not to increase the scope of the federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	11874				I think it is respecting life to do it in an ethical way.	0
ClaimBuster	11875				Not only do 98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000, but I also want to give them additional tax breaks, because they are the drivers of the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	11876				That's going to change when I'm president, but we can't change it unless we fundamentally change Senator McCain's and George Bush's foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	11877				One percent of America, the highest one percent of income earners in America, got $89 billion of tax cut last year.	1
ClaimBuster	11878				But I think it makes sense, I think most Americans in their guts know, that we ought to pass a sort of truth standard.	0
ClaimBuster	11879				We've been dealing with him; he's been dealing drugs to our kids.	1
ClaimBuster	11880				That's why most experts say that this tax scheme will blow a huge hole in the deficit, raise interest rates and weaken the economy and that will take away all the benefits of the tax cut with a weaker economy.	1
ClaimBuster	11881				And our challenge right now is the Iranians continue on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons, and it's a great threat.	1
ClaimBuster	11882				And I don't want historians, ten years from now, to say, these were the years when the tide ran out for the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	11883				We are all in this together.	0
ClaimBuster	11884				But when we look at the growth of G.N.P.	0
ClaimBuster	11885				She's been doing this for 30 years.	1
ClaimBuster	11886				I think I'm a much wiser and more experienced man than I was when I debated four years ago against President Ford.	0
ClaimBuster	11887				And I believe that in cases of India and Africa and Latin America that this is where our emphasis should be.	0
ClaimBuster	11888				This brings up the whole question of what Presidential leadership is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	11889				See, the subjective thing is when does President Bush react?	0
ClaimBuster	11890				We expressed regrets for a flight over Eastern Germany under this Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	11891				And we won the nomination by going out into the streets - barbershops, beauty parlors, restaurants, stores, in factory shift lines also in farmers' markets and livestock sale barns - and we talked a lot and we listened a lot and we learned from the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	11892				They want to get into our market.	1
ClaimBuster	11893				I have one difference with Mr. Perot on that because I don't think we need to touch Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	11894				I want to build more pipelines to move natural gas throughout this hemisphere.	0
ClaimBuster	11895				The one in the field of health is worth mentioning.	0
ClaimBuster	11896				I wanted us to pay for it, since we're at war.	0
ClaimBuster	11897				If we didn't have a depletion allowance of certainly, I believe, the present amount, we would have our oil exploration cut substantially in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	11898				We're going to block grant into Medicaid into the states...	0
ClaimBuster	11899				It's very important to us that this be done with the full involvement of minority citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	11900				I think the American people will draw their own conclusions.	0
ClaimBuster	11901				Now, let me say that there was a time a few years ago when the United States Senate was about to blow up.	1
ClaimBuster	11902				No, Cuba is not lost, and I don't think this kind of defeatist talk by Senator Kennedy helps the situation one bit.	0
ClaimBuster	11903				And I think we can do that.	0
ClaimBuster	11904				I went to New York.	1
ClaimBuster	11905				And yet even though Ambassador Smith and Ambassador Gardner, both Republican Ambassadors, both warned of Castro, the Marxist influences around Castro, the Communist influences around Castro, both of them have testified in the last six weeks, that in spite of their warnings to the American government, nothing was done.	1
ClaimBuster	11906				But I want to get our private sector growing and I know how to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	11907				Look, this, in my view, is the highest responsibility of the President of the United States, which is to maintain the safety of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	11908				And the plans that I talked about will create even more.	0
ClaimBuster	11909				My record on world affairs is pretty well known because I've been president for 4 years, so I feel I've been talking issues.	1
ClaimBuster	11910				And the only criterion I ever put forward in my own mind was who among the several million people in this country would be the best person qualified to be president, if something should happen to me and to join me in being vice president if I should serve out my term.	0
ClaimBuster	11911				And it is important that we don't provide veto power to the United Nations or anyone else in acting in our interests.	0
ClaimBuster	11912				There's no doubt, I think, about that.	0
ClaimBuster	11913				We get nothing for it.	0
ClaimBuster	11914				It is certainly small-business people and others, and they understand that responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	11915				They're just barely enough to pay for my food and pay for an apartment.	1
ClaimBuster	11916				I don't believe the present administration has done that.	0
ClaimBuster	11917				They're looking to us for leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	11918				Secondly, I think one thing that if I were sent to do the job, I would sit down with FDA, look at exactly where we are.	0
ClaimBuster	11919				But I also know how to lead those alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	11920				Right now, you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas.	1
ClaimBuster	11921				The fact is that we now have people from the Middle East, allegedly, coming across the border.	1
ClaimBuster	11922				But I salute him for his passion.	0
ClaimBuster	11923				I would like to unite this country to get an agenda done that will speak to the hopes and aspirations of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	11924				But at least it took that burden away from them.	0
ClaimBuster	11925				I think we're going to have to do better.	0
ClaimBuster	11926				And so I don't support censorship.	0
ClaimBuster	11927				We have made remarkable success.	0
ClaimBuster	11928				A war that I was in, where we had an Army, that it wasn't through any fault of their own, but they were defeated.	1
ClaimBuster	11929				Well, as a matter of fact there is.	0
ClaimBuster	11930				This is a government that thinks a 2% rate of return on your money is satisfactory.	0
ClaimBuster	11931				So, I have never seriously warned and said we must plan according to Armageddon.	1
ClaimBuster	11932				He served this nation with great, great skill and courage and bravery for thirty-five years.	1
ClaimBuster	11933				We held to account a terrorist regime in Saddam Hussein.	0
ClaimBuster	11934				I support it; the president opposes it.	0
ClaimBuster	11935				What we do have right now is a setting where I'd like to bring money from overseas back to this country.	0
ClaimBuster	11936				I am for reform in this area, for tough enforcement at the border, and for many other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, but all my life I've fought for a fair nation.	0
ClaimBuster	11937				Because it was an opportunity for us to demonstrate what we were looking for in a running mate.	0
ClaimBuster	11938				And right now, Osama bin Laden might be in jail or dead.	0
ClaimBuster	11939				Thank the people of Hartford, the Commission, and all those out here who may be listening or watching.	0
ClaimBuster	11940				Just going to make a point.	0
ClaimBuster	11941				The fact is, that in today's oil wells, there is more oil still there than we have so far taken out and used.	1
ClaimBuster	11942				That's my difference with the President.	0
ClaimBuster	11943				Now, private schools play a great role in our society.	0
ClaimBuster	11944				I think Mr. Perot has confronted this deficit issue, but I think it's important to point out that we really have 2 deficits in America, not one.	1
ClaimBuster	11945				He was trying to get rid of sanctions for a reason: He wanted to restart his weapons programs.	1
ClaimBuster	11946				We simply are going to provide a deterrent so that it will be too costly for them if they are nursing any ideas of aggression against us.	0
ClaimBuster	11947				A child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they can't do it because it's school property.	0
ClaimBuster	11948				I will pick judges who will interpret the Constitution, but I'll have no litmus test.	0
ClaimBuster	11949				I'll remind mothers and dads the best weapon is the off/on button, and paying attention to your children, and eating dinner with them and being -- I'm sorry.	0
ClaimBuster	11950				Almost every step of the way, our troops have been left on these extraordinarily difficult missions.	0
ClaimBuster	11951				And I think that anyone that's seeking this position, as well as other people, probably, have thought to themselves, what about this, what about that?	0
ClaimBuster	11952				What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help.	0
ClaimBuster	11953				And I would also point out that Senator Kennedy left out a part of the cost of that program - a twenty-five percent rise in food prices that the people would have to pay.	1
ClaimBuster	11954				The next president of the United States is going to have to decide how we leave, when we leave, and what we leave behind.	0
ClaimBuster	11955				This current campaign financing system has not reflected credit on anybody in either party.	1
ClaimBuster	11956				They would not be in the budget, but you want one now?	0
ClaimBuster	11957				And it isn't a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal problem.	0
ClaimBuster	11958				I visited some of those kids with no limbs today, because they didn't have the armor on those vehicles.	1
ClaimBuster	11959				You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don't believe that Hillary has the stamina.	0
ClaimBuster	11960				I made a mistake in the way I talk about it.	1
ClaimBuster	11961				Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids.	1
ClaimBuster	11962				I think we should stiffen the embargo on the Belgrade government, and I think we have to consider whether or not we should lift the arms embargo now on the Bosnians, since they are in no way in a fair fight with a heavily armed opponent bent on ethnic cleansing.	1
ClaimBuster	11963				Senator McCain likes to talk about earmarks a lot.	1
ClaimBuster	11964				The members of Congress, Arthur Vandenberg, Walter George, were part of the process, and before our nation made a secret agreement, or before we made a bluffing statement, we were sure that we had the backing not only of the president and the secretary of state, but also of the Congress and the people.	1
ClaimBuster	11965				So it's not that we always disagree.	0
ClaimBuster	11966				That shows a lack of understanding.	0
ClaimBuster	11967				Because in this critical year - period of the sixties we've got to move forward, all Americans must move forward together, and we have to get the greatest cooperation possible between labor and management.	0
ClaimBuster	11968				And Governor Romney wants to take us back to those policies, a foreign policy that's wrong and reckless, economic policies that won't create jobs, won't reduce our deficit, but will make sure that folks at the very top don't have to play by the same rules that you do.	0
ClaimBuster	11969				Everybody -- every economist, every businessman -- believes that.	0
ClaimBuster	11970				Taxes are going up when you run up the top two brackets.	1
ClaimBuster	11971				Let's look at the situation with regard to economic growth as it really is.	0
ClaimBuster	11972				Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	11973				And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork-barrel spending projects.	1
ClaimBuster	11974				And important topic, and one which I learned a great deal about, particularly as I was serving as governor of my state, because I had the chance to pull together a cabinet and all the applicants seemed to be men.	1
ClaimBuster	11975				It's in this way, by making wise choices, that we're stronger, we enhance the chances of arms control.	0
ClaimBuster	11976				It's one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had.	0
ClaimBuster	11977				I don't want the federal government making decisions for consumers or for providers.	0
ClaimBuster	11978				That in itself is a big difference.	0
ClaimBuster	11979				But I'm not going to make decisions that I think are wrong for America.	0
ClaimBuster	11980				And the -- the challenge we have -- I know you haven't been in a position to actually execute foreign policy -- but every time you've offered an opinion, you've been wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	11981				"Unless the president speaks, then of course uh - the country doesn't speak, and Franklin Roosevelt said: ""The pre - uh - the presidency of the United States is above all a place of moral leadership."""	1
ClaimBuster	11982				And we have a responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	11983				Now, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws.	1
ClaimBuster	11984				He appointed three people, I appointed three people to get campaign finance reform.	1
ClaimBuster	11985				I would like to tell you a quick story.	0
ClaimBuster	11986				And the reason they do is because they do some smart things.	0
ClaimBuster	11987				And I read in the bulletin about teenage pregnancies, about the difficulties that families are having to make ends meet.	0
ClaimBuster	11988				I thought it was interesting that on the two minutes he spent about a million-and-a-half on my plan, which means he doesn't want you to know what he's doing is loading up IOUs for future generations.	1
ClaimBuster	11989				And there are a long list of thing.	0
ClaimBuster	11990				And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others.	1
ClaimBuster	11991				And we're going to keep on doing that.	0
ClaimBuster	11992				The Senator mentioned the trial lawyers.	1
ClaimBuster	11993				There were eleven dictators when we came into power in 1953 in Latin America.	1
ClaimBuster	11994				And that is when their jobs come up from a dollar an hour to $6 an hour, and ours go down to $6 an hour; then it's leveled again, but in the meantime you've wrecked the country with these kind of deals.	1
ClaimBuster	11995				I can only point out that if we are going to judge the Administrations in terms of our attitude toward dictators, we're glad to have a comparison with the previous administration.	0
ClaimBuster	11996				We had navy vessels that couldn't leave harbor because of lack of crew or, again, lack of spare parts.	1
ClaimBuster	11997				I know Senator Kennedy sees them, too.	1
ClaimBuster	11998				It's invest and grow, put our people first, control health care costs and provide basic health care to all Americans, have an education system 2nd to none and revitalize the private economy.	0
ClaimBuster	11999				I'm also against the pipeline embargo, which you folks attempted to impose.	1
ClaimBuster	12000				There is one issue that stands out above all the rest, one in which every American is concerned, regardless of what group he may be a member and regardless of where he may live.	0
ClaimBuster	12001				I served for eight years in the House of Representatives and I served on the Intelligence Committee, specialized in looking at arms control.	1
ClaimBuster	12002				That's got to be paid by our children and grandchildren, too, if we don't do it.	0
ClaimBuster	12003				Let's just make that very clear.	0
ClaimBuster	12004				We haven't adequately funded veterans' care.	1
ClaimBuster	12005				Uhh - and I think uh - we've tightened it up; we've uh - straightened out their problems that developed over the last few years.	0
ClaimBuster	12006				Whenever you do that, inevitably the dictator is encouraged to try it again.	0
ClaimBuster	12007				And we ought not to crowd these people ahead of them in line.	0
ClaimBuster	12008				I think that's an important part of leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	12009				Certainly we care about the people, we care about the children, we care about the tragedy.	0
ClaimBuster	12010				Remember, he's the person who's accusing me of not acting multilaterally.	1
ClaimBuster	12011				But I think that we also have to have a sense of mission in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	12012				I don't have time in 30 seconds to respond to fix all that.	0
ClaimBuster	12013				Bringing down our deficit by adding $7 trillion of tax cuts and military spending that our military is not asking for, before we even get to the debt that we currently have, that is not going to make us more competitive.	1
ClaimBuster	12014				We tried this with Hitler.	1
ClaimBuster	12015				It immediately was put to use.	1
ClaimBuster	12016				My own background is different from his.	1
ClaimBuster	12017				And in most cases, that failure to meet the test was because of a lack of manning requirements, an inability to fill many of the slots in those divisions.	1
ClaimBuster	12018				Only a few percent of small businesses make more than $250,000 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	12019				I want to finally get something done on Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	12020				But the price of coal is down worldwide.	1
ClaimBuster	12021				I'm in public service because I love this country.	1
ClaimBuster	12022				I served as a pastor in my congregation for about 10 years.	1
ClaimBuster	12023				What we do need to do, though, is control the growth of these mandatory programs.	0
ClaimBuster	12024				I believe instead of doing that, we should concentrate our aid in long-term loans which these people can pay back either in hard money or in local currency.	0
ClaimBuster	12025				That's not the way we're going to create jobs here.	0
ClaimBuster	12026				We also wanna revert back to the stature and the respect that our country had in previous administrations.	0
ClaimBuster	12027				Some of these other countries, particularly in the developing world, their pollution is much worse than anywhere else and their people want higher standards of living.	1
ClaimBuster	12028				I know there are all kinds of circumstances and explanations.	0
ClaimBuster	12029				She's going to get rid of nobody.	0
ClaimBuster	12030				Why can't they do it quietly?	0
ClaimBuster	12031				Now, the Vice President will probably tell you that it's going to take an army of IRS collectors again.	0
ClaimBuster	12032				I am proud of what we did at the Democratic Convention, putting 2 HIV-positive people on the platform, and I am proud of the leadership that I'm going to bring to this country in dealing with the AIDS crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	12033				And what we've said is let's change those certifications.	0
ClaimBuster	12034				I don't think there are any villains, but, boy, is the system rotten.	0
ClaimBuster	12035				And therefore, I think you ought to consider doing something about it, and voting for an Independent in 1980.	0
ClaimBuster	12036				"I was in Pennsylvania with someone who had just graduated -- this was in Philadelphia -- and she said, ""I've got my degree."	1
ClaimBuster	12037				But frankly, I don't think that's the problem today.	0
ClaimBuster	12038				She should not be allowed to run.	0
ClaimBuster	12039				And so the fundamental answer to your question, who can lead and who's shown the ability to get things done?	0
ClaimBuster	12040				It's the largest increase in federal government health care ever.	1
ClaimBuster	12041				My campaign chairman, Secretary Jim Baker's wife.	1
ClaimBuster	12042				We see in -- in Libya, an attack apparently by, I think we know now, by terrorists of some kind against -- against our people there, four people dead.	1
ClaimBuster	12043				I'm simply not going to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	12044				What I've said is I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of working Americans, 95 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	12045				But, when my figures are challenged, as the President himself challenged them after I made them, I think it should be called to the attention of John and the others here that my figures are the figures of the Department of Energy, which has not been overly optimistic in recent years as to how much supply we have left.	0
ClaimBuster	12046				Your premiums are going up.	1
ClaimBuster	12047				He had to be subpoenaed.	0
ClaimBuster	12048				My opponent says we didn't have any allies in this war.	1
ClaimBuster	12049				And that's how best it is to keep the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	12050				I was disappointed in the ruling because I think abortions ought to be more rare in America, and I'm worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions.	0
ClaimBuster	12051				He chose a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans over getting that equipment out into the homeland as fast as possible.	1
ClaimBuster	12052				So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times.	1
ClaimBuster	12053				Well, I want to thank Senator McCain and Bob for moderating.	0
ClaimBuster	12054				Marijuana use is up 141percent.	1
ClaimBuster	12055				We need to be smarter about now we wage a war on terror.	0
ClaimBuster	12056				My opponent was against it.	1
ClaimBuster	12057				I am -- I have a proposal for a tax cut for all people earning less than the $200,000.	0
ClaimBuster	12058				So -- so the question, I think, that we've got to ask ourselves is, yes, we've got to solve this problem short term.	0
ClaimBuster	12059				They were already having a tough time because of high gas prices.	1
ClaimBuster	12060				And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn't say it.	1
ClaimBuster	12061				We've seen uh - in the past the destruction of elected governments, like in Chile, and the strong support of military dictatorship there.	1
ClaimBuster	12062				We paid down the debt for two years.	1
ClaimBuster	12063				But I'm concerned that that will get overturned.	0
ClaimBuster	12064				We don't have modernization now.	1
ClaimBuster	12065				As I said a couple of months ago, I stand here as my own man and I want you to see me for who I really am.	0
ClaimBuster	12066				Senator Obama opposes both storing and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.	1
ClaimBuster	12067				Secondly, I didn't say we had the worst slums in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	12068				We have had less man-hours lost by strikes in these last seven years than we had in the previous seven years, by a great deal.	1
ClaimBuster	12069				Even the administration has admitted they haven't done the training, because they came back to Congress a few weeks ago and asked for a complete reprogramming of the money.	1
ClaimBuster	12070				I think that some common sense gun safety measures are certainly needed with the flood of cheap handguns that have sometimes been working their way into the hands of the wrong people.	0
ClaimBuster	12071				There's some 600-plus tons of unsecured material still in the former Soviet Union and Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	12072				I'll have an administration that will make you proud.	0
ClaimBuster	12073				It's the single most important public health crisis, single most important public health emergency we've had in our lifetimes and I think there are a number of things we have to do including supporting legislation which is now moving through the Congress, which will commit this nation to the resources to find a cure which will provide broad education and prevention, which will provide sensitive and caring treatment for the victims of AIDS.	1
ClaimBuster	12074				Because I went to Washington to fix problems.	1
ClaimBuster	12075				This isn't the kind of Administration we need.	0
ClaimBuster	12076				I believe that -- and when I became Governor of California, I started this, and I continue it in this office -- that any issue that comes before me, I have instructed Cabinet members and staff they are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue.	0
ClaimBuster	12077				And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the world's oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.	1
ClaimBuster	12078				We need all the talent we can get.	0
ClaimBuster	12079				Incidentally, I know the value of making sure our troops have the latest technology.	0
ClaimBuster	12080				And that means tax cuts for the middle-class.	0
ClaimBuster	12081				In our first debate he proposed America pass a global test.	1
ClaimBuster	12082				Give our farm families a decent income with spending $20to $25 billion a year on farm subsidies, and I'm sure we can do that.	0
ClaimBuster	12083				And the president just walks on by this problem.	0
ClaimBuster	12084				I want our legal system to work better.	0
ClaimBuster	12085				That's why I think it's important.	0
ClaimBuster	12086				What you're interested in is trying to figure out, how is this going to impact you?	0
ClaimBuster	12087				I also thought the wealthiest people in America ought to pay for it, ladies and gentlemen.	0
ClaimBuster	12088				In addition, uh - the Department of Justice is fully enforcing, and enforcing effectively, the Voting Rights Act, the legislation that involves jobs, housing for minorities, not only blacks but all others.	1
ClaimBuster	12089				And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies.	0
ClaimBuster	12090				It's stuck in the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	12091				Should I be fortunate enough to earn your confidence, the mission of the United States military will be to be prepared and ready to fight and win war.	0
ClaimBuster	12092				But the point is that -- you see, I hear this all the time.	0
ClaimBuster	12093				Let me just mention three things very quickly.	0
ClaimBuster	12094				The way to make sure that we succeed is to send consistent, sound messages to the Iraqi people that when we give our word, we will keep our word, that we stand with you, that we believe you want to be free.	0
ClaimBuster	12095				I was a school board member, and a library board member.	1
ClaimBuster	12096				Actually, in constant dollars, in the domestic side of the budget, there has been no spending increase in the 4 years that we have been here.	1
ClaimBuster	12097				One reason people are skeptical is because people don't answer the questions they've been asked.	0
ClaimBuster	12098				And so now we've got to take some decisive action.	0
ClaimBuster	12099				You're not going to worry about it anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	12100				The fact is, we haven't done what we need to do to toughen up our borders, and I will.	0
ClaimBuster	12101				We'll start working on Day 1 in the Dole- Kemp administration.	0
ClaimBuster	12102				The top 5 percent of taxpayers will continue to pay 60 percent of the income tax the nation collects.	1
ClaimBuster	12103				The president said he would.	1
ClaimBuster	12104				I'm asking you to see me for who I really am.	0
ClaimBuster	12105				And we have been the safety valve, whether we wanted to or not, with the illegal entry here, in Mexico, where their population is increasing and they don't have an economy that can absorb them and provide the jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	12106				So point one, at the highest priority we must get a bill for depressed areas through the next Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	12107				And that's why people are so concerned.	0
ClaimBuster	12108				And if John wants to disagree with this, he can let me know, that, if the United States has Al Qaida, bin Laden, top-level lieutenants in our sights, and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out.	0
ClaimBuster	12109				I believe we're overextended in too many places.	0
ClaimBuster	12110				We had an $800 billion deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	12111				You've got people doing two and three rotations.	1
ClaimBuster	12112				Number four, we do have to develop their economic -- their economic capabilities.	0
ClaimBuster	12113				I really don't think your rights are being watered down.	0
ClaimBuster	12114				So I don't think we can judge on, the stock market has been strong.	0
ClaimBuster	12115				And nobody will be excluded for pre-existing conditions, which is a huge problem.	0
ClaimBuster	12116				When uh - the Vice President quotes me in January, sixty, I do not believe the federal government should pay directly teachers' salaries, but that was not the issue before the Senate in February.	1
ClaimBuster	12117				I want them to say these were the years when the tide came in; these were the years when the United States started to move again.	0
ClaimBuster	12118				Now, what do we do about it?	0
ClaimBuster	12119				But because of our leadership, because we didn't listen to the freeze -- the nuclear-freeze group, do you remember -- freeze it, back in the late 70s -- freeze, don't touch it; we're going to lock it in now or else we'll have war.	0
ClaimBuster	12120				I think when you measure and post results on the Internet or in the town newspapers, most parents say wait a minute, my child's school isn't doing what I want it to do and, therefore, become involved in education.	0
ClaimBuster	12121				It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.	0
ClaimBuster	12122				It finally gets to 50 cents at the end of the 5th year.	1
ClaimBuster	12123				The Democratic platform and others say five per cent.	1
ClaimBuster	12124				And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.	0
ClaimBuster	12125				And so I don't think our troops ought to be used for what's called nation-building.	0
ClaimBuster	12126				I'm looking at our economic plan because I'm concerned about the future for young people.	0
ClaimBuster	12127				But by doing all the others' favors, she's doing me favors.	0
ClaimBuster	12128				The last thing we want to do is commit more forces anywhere.	0
ClaimBuster	12129				And we both want to cut taxes, the difference is who we want to cut taxes for.	1
ClaimBuster	12130				I offer a new approach.	0
ClaimBuster	12131				Let me say first of all to you that I believe so strongly in the question you asked that I suggested this format tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	12132				Again and again and again, in the middle of the night, at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, my government has called me to take extraordinary steps for Americans in distress, and again and again and again I have responded.	1
ClaimBuster	12133				You know, I've heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years.	0
ClaimBuster	12134				They're going to expand their companies.	0
ClaimBuster	12135				I've said it's going to take some work.	1
ClaimBuster	12136				I wish that, looking back at the beginning of the president's term and even further back than that, that we'd have recognized that there was a growing energy and passion for freedom in that part of the world, and that we would have worked more aggressively with our friend and with other friends in the region to have them make the transition towards a more representative form of government, such that it didn't explode in the way that it did.	0
ClaimBuster	12137				Next Tuesday all of you will go to the polls, will stand there in the polling place and make a decision.	0
ClaimBuster	12138				But we certainly cannot have it in a presidential campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	12139				But it's good that we have them.	0
ClaimBuster	12140				But he wants to raise taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	12141				But my background, my experience, my knowledge of the people of this country, my commitment to our principles that don't change - those are the best bases to correct the horrible mistakes of this administration and restore our own country to a position of leadership in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	12142				It's very hard to get into the Japan market, as everybody knows.	0
ClaimBuster	12143				Now, Governor Reagan is running on a platform that calls for a Constitutional amendment banning abortion.	1
ClaimBuster	12144				The Vice President talks about national security.	1
ClaimBuster	12145				Katherine, I just want to point out that when Governor Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it?	1
ClaimBuster	12146				I would say that ships that carry Iranian oil, can't come into our ports.	0
ClaimBuster	12147				And secondly, only a liberal senator from Massachusetts would say that a 49 percent increase in funding for education was not enough.	1
ClaimBuster	12148				This president just -- I don't know if he sees what's really happened over there.	0
ClaimBuster	12149				And actually, you said it back in 2010.	1
ClaimBuster	12150				What he's proposing after over a trillion in new debt which has been added in the Federal debt in the course of the past eight years, an IOU our children and grandchildren will be paying for years, is a tax cut for the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country, an average of about $30,000 that we're going to give to people making $200,000 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	12151				Because she takes a tremendous amount of money.	1
ClaimBuster	12152				But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	12153				It is America that's in the lead in helping with humanitarian relief for Somalia.	1
ClaimBuster	12154				Well, let me say, first of all, I'd be happy to have a commission deal with this and I appreciate what Senator Dole did on the '83 Social Security commission.	0
ClaimBuster	12155				Russia does continue to battle us in the U.N. time and time again.	1
ClaimBuster	12156				I am for clean water.	0
ClaimBuster	12157				When you come to Washington to try to - as a governor - to try to begin a new program for your people, like uh the treatment of drug addicts, I found there were thirteen different federal agencies that I had to go to, to manage the uh drug treatment program.	1
ClaimBuster	12158				Let -- let -- let me say that we obviously would not wait for the United Nations Security Council.	0
ClaimBuster	12159				George Bush, who I think is one of the finest Vice Presidents this country has ever had -- George Bush and I have crisscrossed the country, and we've had, in these last few months, a wonderful experience.	1
ClaimBuster	12160				But once it exploded, I felt the same as the president did, which is these freedom voices and the streets of Egypt, where the people who were speaking of our principles and the President Mubarak had done things which were unimaginable and the idea of him crushing his people was not something that we could possibly support.	0
ClaimBuster	12161				He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.	0
ClaimBuster	12162				And I have proposed that.	1
ClaimBuster	12163				I said at the time that we had to hold the lid an federal spending, that for every dollar of a tax reduction we had to have an equal reduction in federal expenditures - a one-for-one proposition.	1
ClaimBuster	12164				That is what I want to do.	0
ClaimBuster	12165				But if we sit around blowing all this energy out the window on racial strife and hatred, we are stuck with a sure loser because we have been a melting pot.	0
ClaimBuster	12166				When a man and a women do the same amount of work, a man gets paid $1.00, a women only gets paid 59 cents.	1
ClaimBuster	12167				If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun.	0
ClaimBuster	12168				Mr. Mondale has recently announced a plan of his to get the democracies together and to work with the whole world to turn to democracy.	1
ClaimBuster	12169				That's how the United States began to prepare for its great actions in World War II and in the post-war period.	0
ClaimBuster	12170				President Lincoln opposed the war and there were people who said maybe he shouldn't be president, but I think he made us a pretty good president in wartime.	1
ClaimBuster	12171				I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.	1
ClaimBuster	12172				It came out of the committee of which I was the chairman - the labor subcommittee - in fifty-five.	1
ClaimBuster	12173				For example, as I have said, we have added some four million jobs in the last seventeen months.	1
ClaimBuster	12174				There's a lot of young folks saying, you know, why do I want to be involved with this mess?	0
ClaimBuster	12175				I think they noticed that as well.	0
ClaimBuster	12176				So, I think we are proving that we can go forward with conservation and benefit from that.	0
ClaimBuster	12177				Now, if you believe The Washington Post and you believe this extensive study that's been done -- and I'm reading it -- right after election day this year they're going to hit us with a hundred banks, it will be a $100-billion problem.	1
ClaimBuster	12178				But let me say this, because he spent millions and millions of dollars of advertising on the subject of Boston Harbor.	1
ClaimBuster	12179				We want to be sure it's fair and equitable.	0
ClaimBuster	12180				No, let me tell you something about that.	0
ClaimBuster	12181				This is a real important election.	0
ClaimBuster	12182				Mr. Putin now controls all the television stations.	1
ClaimBuster	12183				Sarah Palin knows about that better than most.	0
ClaimBuster	12184				I believe when we're strongest when we reach out and lead the world and build strong alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	12185				We should never forget that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have.	0
ClaimBuster	12186				It takes eight years, ten years, to do that.	1
ClaimBuster	12187				So to stand here and after eight years and say that you're going to lead on controlling spending and, you know, balancing our tax cuts so that they help middle class families when over the last eight years that hasn't happened I think just is, you know, kind of hard to swallow.	1
ClaimBuster	12188				We have a coal supply that is equal to 50% of the world's coal supply, good for centuries, in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	12189				Even though they had to find out they had 5,000 troops coming, they didn't even understand that.	0
ClaimBuster	12190				We've signed up over 110,000 children to the CHIPS program.	1
ClaimBuster	12191				The presidents would -- president would prefer raising taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	12192				He talks about being a fiscal conservative, or fiscally sound, but he voted over -- he voted 277 times to waive the budget caps, which would have cost the taxpayers $4.2 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	12193				I want new incentives for savings and investment for the young couples who are working hard so they can save and invest on their own on top of Social Security, not at the expense of Social Security, as the governor proposes.	0
ClaimBuster	12194				And I can't tell how proud I am of her and her family.	0
ClaimBuster	12195				And what I said was we should include those and make them enforceable.	1
ClaimBuster	12196				Now, I've told you what the intelligence briefing he received said about that.	1
ClaimBuster	12197				When we went in to Libya, and we were able to immediately stop the massacre there, because of the unique circumstances and the coalition that we had helped to organize.	1
ClaimBuster	12198				That's totally false for him to stand up here and say that.	0
ClaimBuster	12199				So, there is no ratio between taxing and balancing a budget.	1
ClaimBuster	12200				I would do the opposite in every respect.	0
ClaimBuster	12201				It's time to have somebody to step up and say look, let's let younger workers take some of their own money and under certain guidelines invest it in the private markets.	0
ClaimBuster	12202				That could protect 3 million families, 700,000 kids.	1
ClaimBuster	12203				Virginia's in the lead in this, as Governor Clinton properly said, on this identification system for firearms.	1
ClaimBuster	12204				Is America as respected throughout the world as it was?	0
ClaimBuster	12205				But they're now back in helping with elections.	1
ClaimBuster	12206				Well, he didn't include the defensive practice of medicine that costs the federal government some $28 billion a year and costs our society between $60 billion and $100 billion a year.	1
ClaimBuster	12207				There's going to be 125,000 trained by the end of this year.	1
ClaimBuster	12208				We've expanded the Brady Bill to cover people who beat up their spouses and their kids.	1
ClaimBuster	12209				It's never quite as simple as the president wants you to believe.	0
ClaimBuster	12210				And you can be part of our America and you can walk across that bridge to the 21st century with us.	0
ClaimBuster	12211				Now, the reason the Eisenhower Administration has moved, the reason that we've had the funds, for example, locally to build the schools, and the hospitals, and the highways, to make the progress that we have, is because this Administration has encouraged individual enterprise; and it has resulted in the greatest expansion of the private sector of the economy that has ever been witnessed in an eight-year period.	1
ClaimBuster	12212				You said we should have gone into Iraq, despite that fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction.	1
ClaimBuster	12213				And there's going to be an Arab summit, of the neighborhood countries.	1
ClaimBuster	12214				So I complain about that.	0
ClaimBuster	12215				We√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ve got abundant supplies of energy here in America and we√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢d better get after it, we better start exploring it or otherwise we'll be in deep trouble in the future because of our dependency upon foreign sources of crude.	1
ClaimBuster	12216				Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider.	1
ClaimBuster	12217				I came from a tiny town, as you know, Plains, and didn't hold public office, didn't have very much money.	1
ClaimBuster	12218				If you make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year, you will not see a single dime of your taxes go up.	1
ClaimBuster	12219				But I tell you, if you talk to teachers, they will tell you it does make a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	12220				When he took office, 32 million people were on food stamps.	1
ClaimBuster	12221				They talk about family income being up.	0
ClaimBuster	12222				Well, Mr. Carter has uh indicated that uh - he would give a blanket pardon to all uh - draft evaders.	1
ClaimBuster	12223				And nobody really knows, with the latest increase in the Wholesale Price Index - that's about 18% on an annualized basis - what it's going to be.	1
ClaimBuster	12224				No other state programs do that.	1
ClaimBuster	12225				And we have to keep our military strong.	0
ClaimBuster	12226				I think it's important to elect a president who is committed to getting this economy going again, and who realizes we have to abandon trickle-down economics and put the American people first again, and who will send programs to the Congress in the first hundred days to deal with the critical issues that America is crying out for leadership on -- jobs, incomes, the health care crisis, the need to control the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	12227				I'm offering you my own vision, my own experience, my own proposals.	0
ClaimBuster	12228				Invest in American jobs, American education, control health care costs, bring this country together again.	0
ClaimBuster	12229				I have a plan to provide for our schools so we keep the standards but we help our teachers teach and elevate our schools by funding No Child Left Behind.	0
ClaimBuster	12230				And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here.	0
ClaimBuster	12231				He said that he'd cut in half the deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	12232				And sometimes those projects, not -- not the overhead projector that Senator Obama asked for, but some of them that are really good projects, will have -- will have to be eliminated, as well.	0
ClaimBuster	12233				I don't want to say anything critical of Senator Dole, but I've never heard Mr. Ford say that that was his prim- primary consideration - Who is the best person I could choose in this country to be president of the United States?	0
ClaimBuster	12234				Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt.	1
ClaimBuster	12235				And so what I've tried to do as president is to apply those same principles.	0
ClaimBuster	12236				And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage.	1
ClaimBuster	12237				The intelligence I looked at was the same intelligence my opponent looked at, the very same intelligence.	0
ClaimBuster	12238				"We have - may have made more shots but the size of their rocket thrust and all the rest - you yourself said to Khrushchev, ""You may be ahead of us in rocket thrust but we're ahead of you in color television"" in your famous discussion in the kitchen."	1
ClaimBuster	12239				Those children will all go to college.	0
ClaimBuster	12240				Tragically, I was right: Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks.	1
ClaimBuster	12241				We've lost credibility around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	12242				Today it will take 12 generations.	0
ClaimBuster	12243				We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game.	1
ClaimBuster	12244				I saw the agreement that Prime Minister Rabin and Yassir Arafat signed on the West Bank.	1
ClaimBuster	12245				Sometimes we've been embarrassed and sometimes we've been ashamed.	0
ClaimBuster	12246				Nobody called for the invasion of Pakistan.	0
ClaimBuster	12247				Yes, we want change but we are the change.	0
ClaimBuster	12248				Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over.	0
ClaimBuster	12249				And if you have a -- if you have an elderly parent or grandparent who needs long-term care, then you will get help with that.	0
ClaimBuster	12250				Maybe somebody here has done a little business with them.	0
ClaimBuster	12251				Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them.	0
ClaimBuster	12252				"I looked into Mr. Putin's eyes, and I saw three letters, a ""K,"" a ""G,"" and a ""B."""	0
ClaimBuster	12253				Number one, if you've got health insurance, it doesn't mean a government takeover.	0
ClaimBuster	12254				The next four years we will continue to strengthen our homeland defenses.	0
ClaimBuster	12255				we had an aid - 46% of the people who enlisted in the voluntary military up until 1977 said they did so for one particular reason, the G.I.	1
ClaimBuster	12256				In terms of this one on taxes spells out the biggest difference between us.	0
ClaimBuster	12257				We have not been firm and strong.	0
ClaimBuster	12258				-- because we were worried to death that Gaddafi might be building up chemical weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	12259				You've shared your stories with me.	1
ClaimBuster	12260				But I have no loans with Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	12261				Thi- Certainly we have been speaking, I know, of whether we should have retreat or defeat.	0
ClaimBuster	12262				I also want to make sure that we get this economy going.	0
ClaimBuster	12263				I propose a detailed budget, Bob.	0
ClaimBuster	12264				Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.	1
ClaimBuster	12265				It certainly wasn't the attitude that took place out west, however.	0
ClaimBuster	12266				And as for singling people out because of race, you know, James Byrd was singled out because of his race in Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	12267				Now, my fellow Americans, that's an invitation to disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	12268				We now have about four hundred and eighty-five employees, so we've made a rather significant reduction in the number of employees on the White House staff working for the president.	1
ClaimBuster	12269				If we can just tap the intelligence and ability, the sound common sense and the good judgment of the American people, we can once again have a foreign policy to make us proud instead of ashamed.	0
ClaimBuster	12270				It's been my great honor to serve it for many, many years.	1
ClaimBuster	12271				And in the meantime, we have to be strong enough to make certain that the Soviet Union never tempts us.	0
ClaimBuster	12272				I think states should do that for new handguns, because too many criminals are getting guns.	0
ClaimBuster	12273				Our economic future depends upon whether or not our children are going to get the kind of education that lets them go on to college.	0
ClaimBuster	12274				You don't send troops to war without the body armor that they need.	0
ClaimBuster	12275				I'm not quite sure where that came in, except this, which is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you're going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you're going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best.	0
ClaimBuster	12276				That's quite different than some.	0
ClaimBuster	12277				And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.	1
ClaimBuster	12278				But I would cite that as a major accomplishment.	0
ClaimBuster	12279				Now that means the best leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	12280				It means addressing the problems of injustice and inequity, along the lines of race and ethnicity here at home, because in all these other places around the world where they're having these terrible problems, when they feel hope, it is often because they see in us a reflection of their potential.	0
ClaimBuster	12281				It's a tax that taxes people twice.	1
ClaimBuster	12282				I'm proud of that work, again, bipartisan, reaching across the aisle, working together, Democrat and Republican alike.	0
ClaimBuster	12283				Now that will change America.	0
ClaimBuster	12284				Equality of opportunity in the field of housing, which could be done on all federal supported housing by a stroke of the president's pen.	1
ClaimBuster	12285				We had to do something, and even though not all of our allies supported it at first, I think most of them now believe that what we did was an appropriate thing to do.	0
ClaimBuster	12286				Mr. Nixon talks about our being the strongest country in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	12287				And we know that there were further diplomatic efforts under way.	0
ClaimBuster	12288				And certainly, I'm not proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	12289				So we have two that I'd put as number one.	0
ClaimBuster	12290				The Russians are preventing significant action in the United Nations Security Council.	1
ClaimBuster	12291				It costs about $27,000 to pay people to volunteer.	1
ClaimBuster	12292				And so seeing Syria remove Assad is a very high priority for us.	0
ClaimBuster	12293				The president's put it in place as much public debt -- almost as much debt held by the public as al prior presidents combined.	1
ClaimBuster	12294				The last thing I think we should do is something I have been trying to do since I have been president, is every time I do something in a public way, I try to have a real American citizen there who is directly affected by it so that people can see the connection of what happens way across the country, in Washington with more police on the street, in San Diego, clean up the sewage here in San Diego, doubling the border guards here in Southern California, that there is a connection between what we do way back there and what we do here.	1
ClaimBuster	12295				We want the government to pinch their pennies for a change instead of the people pinching their pennies.	0
ClaimBuster	12296				Not as part of the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores.	0
ClaimBuster	12297				We have bridges and tunnels that aren't being secured, chemical plants, nuclear plants that aren't secured, hospitals that are overcrowded with their emergency rooms.	0
ClaimBuster	12298				But it's very important that we not overstep our bounds and I think most people -- most police officers are good, dedicated, honorable citizens who are doing their job, putting their lives at risk who aren't bigoted or aren't prejudiced.	0
ClaimBuster	12299				I believe that we must be able to compete in the market - steel and in all the basic commodities abroad - we must be able to compete against them because we always did because of our technological lead.	0
ClaimBuster	12300				There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this.	0
ClaimBuster	12301				And I'll take responsibility for them.	0
ClaimBuster	12302				And at that point they'll just be like apples falling out of a tree.	0
ClaimBuster	12303				And he took a tremendous pounding and everybody now knows that he took a very unfair pounding.	0
ClaimBuster	12304				We're far away from that now.	0
ClaimBuster	12305				A recent poll was taken among 1,000 enlisted personnel, as well as officers, over half of whom will leave the service when their time of enlistment is up.	1
ClaimBuster	12306				We've got to stop this greed and excess.	0
ClaimBuster	12307				He's talking about that fantastic plan of the Administration to take thousands and thousands of square miles out in the Western states.	0
ClaimBuster	12308				Stop scaring the seniors, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	12309				Thank you very, very much.	0
ClaimBuster	12310				We're not going to get rid of all regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	12311				You have to have regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	12312				I would say this; that we, of course, expect to pick up some seats in both in the House and the Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	12313				But I just find it fascinating that while we sit here tonight we will go into debt an additional $50 million in an hour and a half.	1
ClaimBuster	12314				Medicare, I know you talked about it, but Medicare is relevant for all of us, young and old alike.	1
ClaimBuster	12315				I know what it means to be poor.	0
ClaimBuster	12316				It's so ridiculous what she -- she will defeat ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	12317				I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America.	1
ClaimBuster	12318				But, good as this record is, may I emphasize it isn't enough.	0
ClaimBuster	12319				That's what I learned in Vietnam.	0
ClaimBuster	12320				That's why I'm a big proponent of clean coal technology, to make sure we can use coal but in a clean way.	0
ClaimBuster	12321				The program that I have advocated is one which departs from the present program that we have in this respect.	1
ClaimBuster	12322				Well, the president took Detroit bankrupt.	1
ClaimBuster	12323				There needs to be flexibility for teacher training and teacher hiring with federal money.	0
ClaimBuster	12324				I'm going to find people that want to serve their country.	0
ClaimBuster	12325				We'll make sure they do not end up with weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	12326				And there were many people, like myself, who opposed quotas, who felt there were places where it was overreaching.	1
ClaimBuster	12327				Step one, if I get up there, we're going to clean that up.	0
ClaimBuster	12328				I have never supported quotas.	1
ClaimBuster	12329				Well he made the promise.	1
ClaimBuster	12330				And, as a matter of fact, we haven't avoided arms control talks with the Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	12331				We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals.	0
ClaimBuster	12332				And the American people are willing to have fair, shared sacrifice.	0
ClaimBuster	12333				Under the Medicare prescription drug proposal I'm making, here is how it works, you go to your own doctor.	1
ClaimBuster	12334				And so while it's true that nobody's completely innocent here, we have had over the last eight years the biggest increases in deficit spending and national debt in our history.	1
ClaimBuster	12335				We had the biggest drop in income inequality in 27 years in 1995.	1
ClaimBuster	12336				Now that represents the opportunity we have to take advantage of.	0
ClaimBuster	12337				I said last week I believed in a balanced budget.	1
ClaimBuster	12338				Middle class Americans are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago and they're paying higher taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	12339				And so what I do is I bring down the tax rates, lower deductions and exemptions, the same idea behind Bowles-Simpson, by the way, get the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions, to create more jobs, because there's nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more money, paying more taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	12340				The choices were not good then.	0
ClaimBuster	12341				We could uh - also uh - help our youths with some of the proposals that uh - would give to young people an opportunity to work and learn at the same time just like we give money to young people who are going to college.	0
ClaimBuster	12342				I think most of the economic growth that has taken place is a result of ingenuity and hard work and entrepreneurship and that's the role of goverment to encourage that.	0
ClaimBuster	12343				Senator Obama was wrong about Iraq and the surge.	0
ClaimBuster	12344				No president, through all of American history, has ever ceded, and nor would I, the right to preempt in any way necessary to protect the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	12345				We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines.	0
ClaimBuster	12346				And therefore if we are to have peace, we must know how to deal with the Communists and their leaders.	0
ClaimBuster	12347				Government ought to stand on the side of parents.	0
ClaimBuster	12348				And we've got to attend to them.	0
ClaimBuster	12349				And they buried it till right after the election.	1
ClaimBuster	12350				And when he -- excuse me.	0
ClaimBuster	12351				Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK?	0
ClaimBuster	12352				You can't keep on holding down the value of your currency, stealing our intellectual property, counterfeiting our products, selling them around the world, even to the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	12353				Five million Americans have lost their health insurance in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	12354				If you want somebody who will fight for you and who will fight to have middle-class tax cuts, then I am your man.	0
ClaimBuster	12355				I ran the -- the state of Massachusetts as a governor, to the extent any governor does, and balanced the budget all four years.	1
ClaimBuster	12356				The best America is yet to come.	0
ClaimBuster	12357				But I've had my anxious moments in my life.	0
ClaimBuster	12358				And in 2006, our seniors will get a prescription drug coverage in Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	12359				I see our trade deficit with China, larger than it's -- growing larger every year, as a matter of fact.	1
ClaimBuster	12360				All these specific examples I'm giving tonight -- if you had a business like that, they'd be leading you away and boarding up the doors.	0
ClaimBuster	12361				I try to meet them and I insist that people who work for me meet them, if they don't, they don't stick around very long.	0
ClaimBuster	12362				Well, I think during the campaign, particularly now during this difficult period, we ought to be speaking with one voice, and I appreciate the way the administration has worked hard to calm the tensions.	0
ClaimBuster	12363				But yet, after conceding that, he still says that he would oppose the surge if he had to decide that again today.	1
ClaimBuster	12364				You get more money, you keep more of your taxes by going abroad.	1
ClaimBuster	12365				And we've never had a president since the War between the States that vetoed more bills.	1
ClaimBuster	12366				But when a narcotics wrapped up guy goes in and murders a police officer, I think they ought to pay with their life.	0
ClaimBuster	12367				Every time we've made a serious mistake in foreign affairs, it's been because the American people have been excluded from the process.	0
ClaimBuster	12368				The grain sales have been a benefit to American agriculture.	0
ClaimBuster	12369				If you take care of an elderly in your home, you're going to get the personal exemption increased.	1
ClaimBuster	12370				And I think that everything you do in public life has to be guided by your faith, affected by your faith, but without transferring it in any official way to other people.	0
ClaimBuster	12371				No, they haven't had talks in two years.	1
ClaimBuster	12372				We feel that uh - in education we can have a slight increase - not a major increase.	0
ClaimBuster	12373				You own your own account.	1
ClaimBuster	12374				It's our obligation to make sure that we give him the finest products in the world to put together and we don't break his legs in the process.	0
ClaimBuster	12375				And this is uh - the point of my first statistics that I gave you - that - that the present tax benefits that have been carved out over a long period of years - fifty years - by sharp tax lawyers and by lobbyists have benefited just the rich.	1
ClaimBuster	12376				In the election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln said the question was whether this nation could exist half-slave or half-free.	1
ClaimBuster	12377				They are plotting to kill Americans right now.	1
ClaimBuster	12378				He wanted to give us this big system, that took over about one-seventh of the economy, that put on price controls, created all these state alliances, and would cost $1.5 trillion and force people into managed care, whether they wanted it or not.	1
ClaimBuster	12379				And they believe it because they know I would not take my eye off of the goal: Osama bin Laden.	1
ClaimBuster	12380				I supported the President's trade policy.	1
ClaimBuster	12381				We talk about it all the time.	0
ClaimBuster	12382				Well, as I say, we have to look at what an overthrow there would mean and what the government would be that would follow.	0
ClaimBuster	12383				So here's what I would do.	0
ClaimBuster	12384				Senator McCain cut -- Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didn't believe in a timetable.	1
ClaimBuster	12385				"He said, ""I am a strong liberal Democrat"" - August, '87."	1
ClaimBuster	12386				But I think in retrospect we were too late getting in there.	0
ClaimBuster	12387				South Korea faces a very delicate situation.	0
ClaimBuster	12388				You know, I think about Missy Johnson.	0
ClaimBuster	12389				You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits for...	0
ClaimBuster	12390				It shouldn't be that way.	0
ClaimBuster	12391				First of all, remember that in this campaign season, since Senator Dole's been a candidate, he has bragged about the fact that he voted against Medicare in the beginning, in 1965, one of only 12 members.	1
ClaimBuster	12392				This is for Governor Romney?	0
ClaimBuster	12393				And these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business.	1
ClaimBuster	12394				Let me tell you what the facts are.	0
ClaimBuster	12395				If they do, then they will have heard the harsh reality of what we have to do.	0
ClaimBuster	12396				Our children will not see the American dream because of this debt that somebody somewhere dropped on us.	0
ClaimBuster	12397				Secondly was the federal aid to education bill.	0
ClaimBuster	12398				And it's continuing to evolve, and it's evolving in favor of life.	0
ClaimBuster	12399				That has not proven to be effective, and therefore, I think the better way is to go after the criminal, the individual who commits a crime in the possession of a gun and uses that gun for a part of his criminal activity.	0
ClaimBuster	12400				"You might say, ""Well, you got an example of one that worked better?"""	0
ClaimBuster	12401				Mr. Ford, so far as I know, except for avoiding another Watergate, has not accomplished one single major program for this country.	1
ClaimBuster	12402				I believe those troops deserve better than what they are getting today.	0
ClaimBuster	12403				But we are clearly better off than we were four years ago, as Senator Dole acknowledged this year.	1
ClaimBuster	12404				Look, we're gonna face some serious new challenges in the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	12405				I appreciate the fact that his daughters have been so kind to my daughters in what has been a pretty hard experience for, I guess, young girls, seeing their dads out there campaigning.	0
ClaimBuster	12406				The President was opposed to it in 1993.	1
ClaimBuster	12407				It is also essential in being alert that we be fair; fair because by being fair we uphold the very freedoms that the Communists would destroy.	0
ClaimBuster	12408				Well, the other day my opponent was given a briefing by the CIA.	1
ClaimBuster	12409				You call yourself the King of Debt.	0
ClaimBuster	12410				Paula Jones, who's also here tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	12411				But let me say to you, Mr. Vice President, we're happy with our laws on our books.	1
ClaimBuster	12412				What I'm against is Senator Dole's plan to take money away from all the children we now help with limited Federal funds and help far fewer.	1
ClaimBuster	12413				I know how these people think.	0
ClaimBuster	12414				And what you want to do to Joe the plumber and millions more like him is have their taxes increased and not be able to realize the American dream of owning their own business.	0
ClaimBuster	12415				Then the question is, can we govern?	0
ClaimBuster	12416				All the nuclear weapons are not dismantled.	1
ClaimBuster	12417				Now, the Social Security tax of '77 -- this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest.	0
ClaimBuster	12418				Senator Obama still doesn't quite understand -- or doesn't get it -- that if we fail in Iraq, it encourages Al Qaida.	0
ClaimBuster	12419				He just doesn't understand how the borders work, evidently, to say that.	0
ClaimBuster	12420				It isn't enough to compare what might have been done eight years ago, or ten years ago, or fifteen years ago, or twenty years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	12421				In the Middle East, we've worked for a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, successfully, and have tied ourselves together with Israel and Egypt in a common defense capability.	1
ClaimBuster	12422				Third, not to make any sales of materiel or weapons to a nation which is involved in terrorist activities.	0
ClaimBuster	12423				We need to say here's your tax incentive: if you create American jobs, the old-fashioned way.	0
ClaimBuster	12424				And one thing I have to say.	0
ClaimBuster	12425				Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they've wanted to do forever, but we've made it so easy for them.	1
ClaimBuster	12426				I think you have to help doctors stop practicing defensive medicine.	0
ClaimBuster	12427				Now, he misled the American people in his speech when he said we will plan carefully.	1
ClaimBuster	12428				He put $139 billion of windfall profit into the pockets of the drug companies right out of your pockets.	1
ClaimBuster	12429				That's why my balanced budget plan will still invest and grow this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	12430				And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down.	1
ClaimBuster	12431				We will select the best man we can get.	0
ClaimBuster	12432				There has been reference to expensive spare parts, hammers costing $500.	1
ClaimBuster	12433				Chiang Kai-shek will not withdraw.	0
ClaimBuster	12434				I have a plan to protect the environment so that we leave this place in better shape to our children than we were handed it by our parents.	1
ClaimBuster	12435				And uh - the individuals that uh - with whom I've consulted have not uh - convinced me that uh - a national registration of handguns or handgun owners will solve the problem you're talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	12436				I support the right to keep and bear arms.	0
ClaimBuster	12437				The President exempts the IRS which creates three-fourths of the paperwork.	1
ClaimBuster	12438				Mr. Stone, in my State of the Union address earlier this year, I pointed out that any threat to the stability or security of the Persian Gulf would be a threat to the security of our own country.	1
ClaimBuster	12439				Our long-term interest rates are still pretty high because of our deficit and because of our economic performance.	1
ClaimBuster	12440				support the uh - Republican uh - platform, which calls for the constitutional amendment that would uh - outlaw abortions.	1
ClaimBuster	12441				It's not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want.	0
ClaimBuster	12442				We pursued Al Qaida wherever Al Qaida tries to hide.	0
ClaimBuster	12443				We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions.	0
ClaimBuster	12444				"If we don't have access to their markets the same way they've access our markets, we ought to say, ""Wait, that's enough."	0
ClaimBuster	12445				And we're going to have to help the Pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people.	0
ClaimBuster	12446				Now, after all of those investigations by objective, responsible people, I think the matter is closed once and for all.	0
ClaimBuster	12447				Now, I believe that a President must command that White House and those who work for him.	0
ClaimBuster	12448				And let me say this-all he can talk about-he goes around ranting about Noriega.	0
ClaimBuster	12449				And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently.	0
ClaimBuster	12450				The governor has proposed skipping the next generation of weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	12451				"And I once called on somebody, ""Well, change your behavior."	1
ClaimBuster	12452				Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	12453				That gets to the national honor.	0
ClaimBuster	12454				That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	12455				And so I say both the candidates and both the vice presidential candidates, I would hope as well - including Senator Johnson - should talk on this issue at every opportunity.	0
ClaimBuster	12456				The most important thing we can do is to make sure we control our own energy.	0
ClaimBuster	12457				And nothing has been done, and they are now charging to take tourists there to see this terrible desolation.	1
ClaimBuster	12458				One of the most important things is to continue the research and development component.	0
ClaimBuster	12459				We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali.	1
ClaimBuster	12460				And then you cut education spending when you came into office.	1
ClaimBuster	12461				And meanwhile, North Korea has got nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	12462				As a matter of fact, in the proposal for the Alaska lands legislation, 100% of all the offshore lands would be open for exploration, and 95% of all the Alaska lands, where it is suspected or believed that minerals might exist.	1
ClaimBuster	12463				There is now a federal judge's opinion about the current management of this program ordering the State of Texas to do -- you should read that judge's language about this.	1
ClaimBuster	12464				We reduced our industrial waste by 11%.	1
ClaimBuster	12465				This Janet Yellen of the Fed.	0
ClaimBuster	12466				Medical care for the aged, I would put under social security.	0
ClaimBuster	12467				And we ask you for our hand for your hands and your hearts, and your votes on the 8th of November so we can move forward in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	12468				Now, I believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertaxed; it's that government is overfed.	0
ClaimBuster	12469				And his Secretary of the Treasury said he's studying a sales tax or a value-added tax.	1
ClaimBuster	12470				And local -- it's not enough to leave it up to the local school districts.	0
ClaimBuster	12471				Let me say this about AIDS.	0
ClaimBuster	12472				I wouldn't have sent troops to Haiti.	0
ClaimBuster	12473				And the black market sale price was about $250 million.	1
ClaimBuster	12474				I will not cut our commitment to our military.	0
ClaimBuster	12475				But we cannot guarantee equal results in America.	0
ClaimBuster	12476				The claim that it would have put hundred and forty thousand miners out of work is uh - hard to believe, when at the time Mr. Ford vetoed it, the United Mine Workers was uh - supporting the bill.	1
ClaimBuster	12477				He's called them phony and fuzzy.	0
ClaimBuster	12478				So, in terms of priorities, we've got to be financially strong.	0
ClaimBuster	12479				And I'm going to try to do better.	0
ClaimBuster	12480				Now this tax bill - that hasn't reached the White House yet, but is expected in a day or two - it's about fifteen hundred pages.	1
ClaimBuster	12481				This has hurt this country, and a President's supposed to command.	0
ClaimBuster	12482				Now, Senator McCain talks about small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	12483				As I indicated earlier, we did agree on a twenty-four-hundred limitation on uh - uh - launchers of ballistic missiles.	1
ClaimBuster	12484				We're going to have to come up with alternatives, and that means that the United States government is working with the private sector to fund the kind of innovation that we can then export to countries like China that also need energy and are setting up one coal power plant a week.	1
ClaimBuster	12485				We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people.	0
ClaimBuster	12486				The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule.	1
ClaimBuster	12487				I think we can do better.	0
ClaimBuster	12488				I have recommended to the Congress that we develop the uranium enrichment plant at Portsmouth, Ohio, which is a publicly owned - U.S. government facility and have indicated that the private program which would follow on in Alabama is one that may or may not uhh - be constructed.	1
ClaimBuster	12489				I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course.	0
ClaimBuster	12490				I disagree with both of them.	0
ClaimBuster	12491				He's already taken that off the board, capital gains are going to continue to be at a low rate so we -- we're not going to get money that way.	1
ClaimBuster	12492				You look at Haiti, where we spend about three billion dollars and we got an alarm call there about two weeks ago.	1
ClaimBuster	12493				I think we need a president who has the credibility to bring the allies back to the table and to do what's necessary to make it so America isn't doing this alone.	0
ClaimBuster	12494				When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year.	1
ClaimBuster	12495				So -- but, look, you're not interested in hearing politicians pointing fingers.	0
ClaimBuster	12496				It's about my vision for America and about his liberal vision for America.	0
ClaimBuster	12497				Obviously if Social Security is a very important program, it should -- it will be preserved.	0
ClaimBuster	12498				And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record.	0
ClaimBuster	12499				My plan drops the rate from 15% to 10% and increases the child credit from $500 to $1,000 to make the code more fair for everybody, not just a few, not just a handful.	1
ClaimBuster	12500				And as a result, the families of some of our young servicemen are on food stamps today.	1
ClaimBuster	12501				I see it as a security issue, I see it as an economic issue, and I see it as a human-rights issue.	0
ClaimBuster	12502				I got a letter today as I left Sarasota, Florida.	1
ClaimBuster	12503				I think we got to stay that way and continue to increase our capabilities to meet any potential threat.	0
ClaimBuster	12504				What I said was that this matter should be thoroughly gone into to make sure that there aren't loopholes.	1
ClaimBuster	12505				It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance.	0
ClaimBuster	12506				Keep the Federal Reserve independent, but let's live in a world of reality.	0
ClaimBuster	12507				But let's not put it there; let's put it in terms of the average family.	0
ClaimBuster	12508				You had a surgeon -- or before General McCaffrey (ph) you had a lady who said we ought to consider legalizing drugs.	1
ClaimBuster	12509				For the first time in history, you will be taxing people's health care benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	12510				He didn't happen to see that light during the first three years as a member of the United States Senate, $932 million in requests.	0
ClaimBuster	12511				Do you remember the Senator from Boston chanting out there and the ridicule factor from that lady from Texas that was on there; I mean, come on, this was just outrageous.	0
ClaimBuster	12512				I hope he would grant me the same.	0
ClaimBuster	12513				This nation of ours has got a solemn duty to defeat this ideology of hate.	0
ClaimBuster	12514				You've suggested a commission, Newt Gingrich did, I suggested that at least four or five years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	12515				I do it because it's the responsibility of leadership, I do it because we have to solve this problem together.	0
ClaimBuster	12516				And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families.	1
ClaimBuster	12517				Now, I know that this has been called inflationary by my opponent and by the man who isn't here tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	12518				In other words, what I'm talking about is not putting government back to getting less money than government's been getting, but simply cutting the increase in in spending.	0
ClaimBuster	12519				Thank you, all of you, for taking part.	0
ClaimBuster	12520				But we didn't use American forces, the best trained in the world, to go kill him.	1
ClaimBuster	12521				He tried to keep it from coming to my desk.	1
ClaimBuster	12522				I'm going to get it right for those soldiers, because it's important to Israel, it's important to America, it's important to the world, it's important to the fight on terror.	0
ClaimBuster	12523				He did not say that.	1
ClaimBuster	12524				But Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s and the economic policies of the 1920s.	1
ClaimBuster	12525				I said that we would create jobs for our people, and we did -- 6 million in the last 20 or 21 months.	1
ClaimBuster	12526				The middle class is getting crushed under the policies of a president who has not understood what it takes to get the economy working again.	0
ClaimBuster	12527				You should expect that from both of us.	0
ClaimBuster	12528				It's been my record as Governor of Texas, it will be how I conduct myself if I'm fortunate enough to earn your vote as President of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	12529				Governor Carter skims over a very serious and a very broad subject.	0
ClaimBuster	12530				A free Iraq will set a powerful example in the part of the world that is desperate for freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	12531				My cutbacks will be done through attrition, by the way.	0
ClaimBuster	12532				The other things are false, but honestly, I'd love to talk about getting rid of ISIS, and I'd love to talk about other things...	0
ClaimBuster	12533				Not until again in 1996 -- I don't want anybody to smoke.	0
ClaimBuster	12534				Margaret, may I go back and just say to the vice president that I didn't raid the pension fund of Massachusetts you are dead wrong, George, we didn't do that.	1
ClaimBuster	12535				Jim, we have a direct disagreement on this.	0
ClaimBuster	12536				They do have stakes in it.	0
ClaimBuster	12537				But the dictator Milosevic was hanging on.	1
ClaimBuster	12538				But don't get into this smoke screen here Oscar.	0
ClaimBuster	12539				If you're in a very poor family or if you have very high costs, Medicare will pay all the costs, a $25 premium, and much better benefits than you can possibly find in the private sector.	1
ClaimBuster	12540				There are 4 million people who are waiting in line to get here legally.	1
ClaimBuster	12541				Where the Soviet Union has acted irresponsibly, as they have in many of those countries, especially, recently, in Poland, I believe we ought to insist that Western credits extended to the Soviet Union bear the market rate.	0
ClaimBuster	12542				She wants to have open borders.	1
ClaimBuster	12543				I know the morality that's prompting that question, and I respect it enormously.	0
ClaimBuster	12544				And John spoke about 15 years ago, on the position that he.	0
ClaimBuster	12545				And there's been a constant squabbling between the president and the Congress, and that's not the way this country ought to be run.	0
ClaimBuster	12546				And so let me just say this.	0
ClaimBuster	12547				I mean, it seemed to me at the time the assault weapon ban was not effective.	0
ClaimBuster	12548				Is -- is al-Qaida on the run, on its heels?	0
ClaimBuster	12549				He said that there could be secretary-level and lower level meetings.	1
ClaimBuster	12550				I felt like unchecked Milosevic would harm NATO, and so it depends on the situation, Mr. Vice President.	0
ClaimBuster	12551				I think from the very beginning, one of the challenges we've had with Iran is that they have looked at this administration, and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be.	0
ClaimBuster	12552				"That I don't think is an example of ""speaking softly."""	0
ClaimBuster	12553				A message just won't do it.	0
ClaimBuster	12554				And, by the way, if a state gets in trouble, well, we can step in and see if we can find a way to help them.	0
ClaimBuster	12555				Here is Ahmadinenene (ph), Ahmadinejad, who is, Ahmadinejad, who is now in New York, talking about the extermination of the State of Israel, of wiping Israel off the map, and we're going to sit down, without precondition, across the table, to legitimize and give a propaganda platform to a person that is espousing the extermination of the state of Israel, and therefore then giving them more credence in the world arena and therefore saying, they've probably been doing the right thing, because you will sit down across the table from them and that will legitimize their illegal behavior.	1
ClaimBuster	12556				In fact, when I fell off the podium in Chico, before I lit the ground, hit the ground I had call on my cell phone from a trial lawyer saying I think we've got a case here.	1
ClaimBuster	12557				The governor's wife has been very active in the homeless.	1
ClaimBuster	12558				I was seeing B-52s, they're old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them.	1
ClaimBuster	12559				One of the commitments that I made was to deregulate the major industries of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	12560				Your question is difficult to answer, because, in the situation right now, no one wants to say anything that would inadvertently delay, in any way, the return of those hostages if there if there is a chance that they're coming home soon, or that might cause them harm.	0
ClaimBuster	12561				And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard.	0
ClaimBuster	12562				There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him.	1
ClaimBuster	12563				Health-care costs for the average American have gone up 64 percent; tuitions have gone up 35 percent; gasoline prices up 30 percent; Medicare premiums went up 17 percent a few days ago; prescription drugs are up 12 percent a year.	1
ClaimBuster	12564				You don't test every year.	0
ClaimBuster	12565				I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC.	1
ClaimBuster	12566				(Laughter, scattered applause) I'm serious though I think I'm a little more lovable these days than I used to be back in my youth when I began in my state legislature.	0
ClaimBuster	12567				He says he wants a system that will make nuclear wars safe, so nobody's going to get hurt.	0
ClaimBuster	12568				I think we have to respect that.	0
ClaimBuster	12569				We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations.	1
ClaimBuster	12570				And we can do better than the past administration has done.	0
ClaimBuster	12571				That will not help us compete with China.	1
ClaimBuster	12572				We've become almost a welfare state.	0
ClaimBuster	12573				We found out today that over the past 13 months, we've added 1.9 million new jobs in the last 13 months.	1
ClaimBuster	12574				And when we have to find twenty-five thousand new jobs a week for the next ten years, we're going to have to grow more.	0
ClaimBuster	12575				A free Iraq is essential for the security of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	12576				But what we need is financial reform; we need some real financial reform, banking reform legislation.	0
ClaimBuster	12577				Carole, the thing that saved us in this global economic slowdown has been our exports, and what I'm trying to do is increase our exports.	1
ClaimBuster	12578				I think one of the hallmarks of my relationship in Austin, Texas, is that I've had the capacity to work with both Republicans and Democrats.	0
ClaimBuster	12579				We've got to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't want us very -- like us very much.	1
ClaimBuster	12580				So I'm the only one that's untarnished at this point?	0
ClaimBuster	12581				We need to have strong allies.	0
ClaimBuster	12582				But at the same time, I think it's going to take a dramatic measure of that kind to convince the American people that we will have to reduce the use of the private automobile.	0
ClaimBuster	12583				And I heard them ask just for something that would give them hope.	1
ClaimBuster	12584				Now, hundreds, thousands of good, decent people, whole cities up here in this state are adversely impacted because they would not move in a timely way.	1
ClaimBuster	12585				I favor that rather than massive federal spending programs which will come into effect usually long after you've passed through the recessionary period.	0
ClaimBuster	12586				We've got to make sure that we're hardening our chemical sites.	0
ClaimBuster	12587				In some cases, they're murderers, drug lords, drug problems.	1
ClaimBuster	12588				So I think that could help.	0
ClaimBuster	12589				Now, of all times in America, we need to cut people's taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	12590				If we're not an economic superpower, we're a used to be and we will no longer be a force for good throughout the world.	0
ClaimBuster	12591				I will tell you I'm the kind of person, I don't hire or fire somebody based upon their sexual orientation.	0
ClaimBuster	12592				Number two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	12593				He said when I took office, the price of gasoline was $1.80, $1.86.	1
ClaimBuster	12594				You know, Bob, I don't know.	0
ClaimBuster	12595				What I said was that ten years ago, we were producing twice as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union and today they're producing twice as many as we are, and that this affects our security around the world.	1
ClaimBuster	12596				On one of those tapes may be the enemy being right the next time.	0
ClaimBuster	12597				Well, it starts with enforcing law.	0
ClaimBuster	12598				You see the turmoil in Poland today.	0
ClaimBuster	12599				Mr. Bush made that charge.	1
ClaimBuster	12600				I'd like to ask the Governor to join in getting for the president what 43 governors have, the line-item veto.	1
ClaimBuster	12601				We have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history.	1
ClaimBuster	12602				I think the choice is clear and it involves the future.	0
ClaimBuster	12603				So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court.	0
ClaimBuster	12604				But I'm running on the record of what we have asked for.	0
ClaimBuster	12605				If we invest now in our young people and their ability to go to college, that will allow them to drive this economy into the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	12606				So that really isn't an issue in this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	12607				I tell it like it is.	0
ClaimBuster	12608				I want everybody to know should I be the president Israel's going to be our friend.	0
ClaimBuster	12609				I'm a governor of state and I don't like it when the federal government tells us what to do.	1
ClaimBuster	12610				In September 2003, he supported amnesty for illegal aliens.	1
ClaimBuster	12611				This administration tried to take over healthcare and impose a governmental system.	1
ClaimBuster	12612				The gun lobby's on his side.	1
ClaimBuster	12613				And it also requires us to maintain some continuity -- some bipartisan American commitment to certain principles.	0
ClaimBuster	12614				He has promised a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund for young working adults to invest and save on their own.	1
ClaimBuster	12615				We have demanded that the American people sacrifice, and they have done very well.	0
ClaimBuster	12616				I have kept the faith with our country.	0
ClaimBuster	12617				I have a better plan to be able to fight the war on terror by strengthening our military, strengthening our intelligence, by going after the financing more authoritatively, by doing what we need to do to rebuild the alliances, by reaching out to the Muslim world, which the president has almost not done, and beginning to isolate the radical Islamic Muslims, not have them isolate the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	12618				And my tax cut does not come close to eliminating that $86 billion increase.	1
ClaimBuster	12619				The test of whether America moves is whether the federal government, plus the state government, plus the local government, plus the biggest segment of all - individual enterprise - moves.	0
ClaimBuster	12620				At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here.	0
ClaimBuster	12621				Maybe they -- they probably are addictive.	0
ClaimBuster	12622				I cannot still understand why this Administration and Mr. Nixon oppose putting medical care for the aged under Social Security to give them some security.	1
ClaimBuster	12623				They're working harder and higher and harder paying more taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	12624				Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.	1
ClaimBuster	12625				So 80% -- now the problem with completely eliminating it goes back to the wealthiest 1%.	1
ClaimBuster	12626				I think the American people want a Republican president to check on any excesses that come out of the next Congress, if it is a Democratic Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	12627				We're suing each other too much and caring for each other too little.	0
ClaimBuster	12628				I think it's, frankly, not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and they're going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives.	0
ClaimBuster	12629				I'm in favor of testing as a way of measuring performance.	1
ClaimBuster	12630				Let's do it that way.	0
ClaimBuster	12631				It will actually raise taxes on nine million people and, in addition to that, it will force bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment than the ones that he and Mr. Gingrich passed that I vetoed last year.	1
ClaimBuster	12632				Some time ago, Mr. Mondale said something about education and college students and help of that kind.	1
ClaimBuster	12633				Well, thank you, Oliver, and that's an excellent question, because as you just described it, bailout, when I believe that it's rescue, because -- because of the greed and excess in Washington and Wall Street, Main Street was paying a very heavy price, and we know that.	1
ClaimBuster	12634				We've got a whole bunch of countries that pay a price for dealing with the United States of America now.	1
ClaimBuster	12635				He talked about the fact that Iraqis love to be free.	0
ClaimBuster	12636				And that cost us revenue.	1
ClaimBuster	12637				"Yes, I had used -- ""last resort'' would always be with me."	0
ClaimBuster	12638				But 9/11 changed it all.	0
ClaimBuster	12639				It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009.	1
ClaimBuster	12640				So we have a long way to go in our intelligence services.	0
ClaimBuster	12641				We need to do this together and we can.	0
ClaimBuster	12642				John Kennedy proposed cutting capital gains.	1
ClaimBuster	12643				So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.	0
ClaimBuster	12644				Iran has power over North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	12645				It was just right through the roof.	0
ClaimBuster	12646				The president has been AWOL for four years.	1
ClaimBuster	12647				We have to practice what we preach.	0
ClaimBuster	12648				Ambassador Glaspie did a lot of talking right after July 25 and that's a fact and it's in all the newspapers.	1
ClaimBuster	12649				We need to be doing more in education, not less.	0
ClaimBuster	12650				Saddam Hussein had no intention of disarming.	0
ClaimBuster	12651				And, number four, we've got to make sure that we're helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country.	0
ClaimBuster	12652				I have fought against excessive spending and outrages.	1
ClaimBuster	12653				We have to have strong borders.	0
ClaimBuster	12654				Our hearts go out to you.	0
ClaimBuster	12655				Then at the end of the war, when they had to go testify about it, their stories are a total disconnect from what they said in August, September and October.	1
ClaimBuster	12656				We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator.	1
ClaimBuster	12657				I remember what the administration tried to do in 1993.	0
ClaimBuster	12658				During the course of the campaign in 1994 I was asked do you support the death penalty.	1
ClaimBuster	12659				The difference is that while my plan starts with new accountability and maintains local control, it doesn't stop there.	0
ClaimBuster	12660				Now, we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance, with an emphasis on the prevention of disease, an emphasis on out-patient care, not in-patient care; an emphasis on hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care far those who are ill, an emphasis on catastrophic health insurance, so that if a family is threatened with being wiped out economically because of a very high medical bill, then the insurance would help pay for it.	0
ClaimBuster	12661				The drunk driver had no money.	1
ClaimBuster	12662				I have seen Communism abroad.	0
ClaimBuster	12663				I have a clear record of bipartisanship.	1
ClaimBuster	12664				Second, in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	12665				Just again, the example of the eloquence of Senator Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	12666				Number four, the rule of law.	0
ClaimBuster	12667				And I was very strong.	0
ClaimBuster	12668				He said he would work through a real alliance.	1
ClaimBuster	12669				In addition to that, we need to have - uh a realization that we've got uh about thirty-five years worth of oil left in the whole world.	1
ClaimBuster	12670				Now, it's true that I say that you are going to have to make sure that your child has health care, because children are relatively cheap to insure and we don't want them going to the emergency room for treatable illnesses like asthma.	0
ClaimBuster	12671				We need an investment incentive to modernize plant and equipment; we've got to control the health care costs for those people -- otherwise we can't keep the manufacturing jobs here; and we need a tough trade policy that is fair, that insists on open markets in return for open markets.	0
ClaimBuster	12672				We have a lot of differences in our country, and some of us believe that other people's decisions are wrong, even immoral.	0
ClaimBuster	12673				And I believe the American people have to make the choice on November eighth between the view of whether we have to move ahead faster, whether what we're doing now is not satisfactory, whether we have to build greater strength at home and abroad and Mr. Nixon's view.	0
ClaimBuster	12674				That was the wrong judgment, and it's been costly to us.	0
ClaimBuster	12675				If you want to stop talking about it and do it, then I'll be glad to go up there and we'll get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	12676				At the same time, in our Judeo-Christian tradition, we recognize the right of taking a human life in self-defense.	1
ClaimBuster	12677				I think the real winners of the debates were the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	12678				Here a CCC type program would be appropriate to channel money into the ah - cha- in - in into the sharing with the private sector and also local and state governments to employ young people who are now out of work.	0
ClaimBuster	12679				And that's what this country should be doing.	0
ClaimBuster	12680				Meanwhile, the Democrats in the Senate and some -- and some members of Congress defended what Fannie and Freddie were doing.	1
ClaimBuster	12681				I think he gets a -- oh, I'm sorry, you're right, go ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	12682				We're a nation that believes in the Second Amendment, and I believe in the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	12683				Why wouldn't we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets?	0
ClaimBuster	12684				We need to encourage business, create jobs, not spread the wealth around.	0
ClaimBuster	12685				I will release my tax returns -- against my lawyer's wishes -- when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted.	1
ClaimBuster	12686				Governor Clinton keeps hitting me on vetoing legislation.	1
ClaimBuster	12687				Again, I will say I will do my best to make this a discussion of ideas and issues, not insults.	0
ClaimBuster	12688				And that's to make sure the education system works.	0
ClaimBuster	12689				You voted to increase taxes 98 times.	1
ClaimBuster	12690				I would pick somebody who would strictly interpret the Constitution of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	12691				Now, this is not standing still.	0
ClaimBuster	12692				I think we've been fighting from day one to do something about the inner cities.	0
ClaimBuster	12693				I'm prepared to make them, the Vice President is not.	0
ClaimBuster	12694				A lot of people are sick and tired of the bitterness in Washington, D.C. and therefore they don't want any part of politics.	0
ClaimBuster	12695				Before I hit the ground, my cell phone rang and this trial lawyer said, I think we've got a case here.	1
ClaimBuster	12696				"Actually just going to them and saying, ""We're going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody's going to get a lower rate."""	1
ClaimBuster	12697				I'm standing here as proof that in America the possibilities are unlimited.	0
ClaimBuster	12698				As a matter of fact, he said it was not and should not be subject to partisan demagoguery because it was too important for the United States or for the world.	0
ClaimBuster	12699				However, if the insurance company doesn't follow the findings of the IRO, then that becomes a cause of action in a court of law.	0
ClaimBuster	12700				And that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad.	0
ClaimBuster	12701				But when people suggest that I pal around with terrorists, then we're not talking about issues.	0
ClaimBuster	12702				There's funds for 3,000 new schools created by teachers and parents, sometimes by business people, called charter schools that have no rules, they're free of bureaucracy and can only stay in existence if they perform and teach children.	1
ClaimBuster	12703				In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious.	0
ClaimBuster	12704				The last year I was in office uh - our budget was - was actually less than it was a year before, uh which showed a great uh improvement.	1
ClaimBuster	12705				You can quote all the numbers you want, but I'm telling you we care about our people in Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	12706				I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government.	0
ClaimBuster	12707				And I think it will happen in my lifetime.	0
ClaimBuster	12708				I think this is a test of leadership, and I think the American people know the difference.	0
ClaimBuster	12709				My mother and father, during the Depression, worked very hard to give me an opportunity to do better in our great country.	0
ClaimBuster	12710				And one of the reasons our selection of a running mate is so important, it is such a test of the kinds of standards we'll set, is because it tells the American people in advance of the election just what kind of people we're looking for.	0
ClaimBuster	12711				Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that's horrifying.	0
ClaimBuster	12712				As a matter of fact, your record is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative senator from Massachusetts.	1
ClaimBuster	12713				And I don't believe that at all I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use.	0
ClaimBuster	12714				We've wrecked the airline industry already because of all these leverage buyouts and all these terrible things that have happened to the airline industry.	1
ClaimBuster	12715				Oh, you're going to let me.	0
ClaimBuster	12716				Absolutely we've got to make sure they get educated.	0
ClaimBuster	12717				But, where are we getting the money that the Federal Government is putting out to help them?	0
ClaimBuster	12718				We have to fix our health care system, which is putting an enormous burden on families.	0
ClaimBuster	12719				Federal funding for education is up substantially -- Pell grants are up.	1
ClaimBuster	12720				The sooner the better off we'll be, if you put tougher sanctions on Castro, not try to make it easier for him.	0
ClaimBuster	12721				You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life.	0
ClaimBuster	12722				But I built a phenomenal company.	0
ClaimBuster	12723				And we have a very important decision to make.	0
ClaimBuster	12724				And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.	1
ClaimBuster	12725				When we look, for example, at the vote on the Congo.	0
ClaimBuster	12726				I don't think America's youth are interest groups, I think they're our future.	0
ClaimBuster	12727				I just care whether it works for America and whether it's going to make us stronger.	0
ClaimBuster	12728				We know where they're cutting.	0
ClaimBuster	12729				We took it out of politics.	1
ClaimBuster	12730				Secondly, Mr. Nixon has continued to state - and he stated it last week - these fantastic figures of what the Democratic budget would c- uh - platform would cost.	1
ClaimBuster	12731				The same country that's helping us try to stop the flow of drugs into our country that's killing young Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	12732				And also General Petraeus said the same thing.	1
ClaimBuster	12733				But I do make a pledge that in the next ten days when we're asking the American people to make one of the most important decisions in their lifetime, because I think this election is one of the mast vital in the history of America, that uh - we do together what we can to stimulate voter participation.	0
ClaimBuster	12734				And so if Kim Jong Il decides again to not honor an agreement, he's not only doing injustice to America, he'd be doing injustice to China, as well.	0
ClaimBuster	12735				Crime has gone down but it's because the mayors like Rudy Giuliani where one third of the drop happened in one city, New York City.	1
ClaimBuster	12736				We haven't felt so insecure that we've reached for the club of state to have our point of view.	0
ClaimBuster	12737				We are spending a lot of money to modernize our weapons system.	0
ClaimBuster	12738				They taught me that this was the greatest country in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	12739				With interest rates down and inflation down, the cruelest tax of all, caught up in a global slowdown right now, that that will change if you go with the programs I've talked about and if you help with job retraining and education.	1
ClaimBuster	12740				We hadn't caught bin Laden.	1
ClaimBuster	12741				And I think this would uh - this would be uh easy to accomplish, to get jobs down, without having strong in- inflationary pressures that - that would be necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	12742				Uh - I think it's accurate to say that the uh - strip-mining law which was passed twice by the Congress - uh - and was only like two votes I believe of being overridden - would have been good for the country.	1
ClaimBuster	12743				You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it.	1
ClaimBuster	12744				But that's not the $54 billion cost that John is talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	12745				But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart.	1
ClaimBuster	12746				Now, it's not the Republicans' fault, of course, and it's not the Democrats' fault.	0
ClaimBuster	12747				I would indict him for it.	0
ClaimBuster	12748				If the rate of increase in government spending can be held at 5 percent -- we're not far from there -- by 1989 that would have reduced the budget deficits down to a $30 or $40 billion level.	1
ClaimBuster	12749				We don't need mass armies anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	12750				Now as far as the present situation is concerned, I think it's time that we nail a few of these distortions about the United States that have been put out.	0
ClaimBuster	12751				We have worked hard for peace and freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	12752				Let me tell you what I feel.	0
ClaimBuster	12753				I can't think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country.	0
ClaimBuster	12754				It's cut federal aid to education; it's cut Pell grants and loans to close the door to college opportunity on youngsters all over this country.	1
ClaimBuster	12755				I make those charts you see on television.	1
ClaimBuster	12756				But we've also got to provide them with financial and concrete assistance to help rebuild their economies.	0
ClaimBuster	12757				We don't yet know what our tax revenues are going to be.	0
ClaimBuster	12758				So we must use all of these weapons for the purpose of combating recession if it should come.	0
ClaimBuster	12759				And it's fair, shared sacrifice to do the right thing for our country and for our children.	0
ClaimBuster	12760				That we spent -- the top 1% receive 223 as opposed to 445 billion in new spending.	1
ClaimBuster	12761				I just don't believe we ought to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	12762				America has a lot of families that are in trouble today.	0
ClaimBuster	12763				Again it's important to put the situation in perspective.	0
ClaimBuster	12764				The American people want arms control.	0
ClaimBuster	12765				And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or -- or Senator Wyden, who's the co-author of the bill with -- with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill -- Bill Clinton's chief of staff.	1
ClaimBuster	12766				What I ask is this.	0
ClaimBuster	12767				Bill and I have been involved in trying to help Haiti for many years.	1
ClaimBuster	12768				And are they good for our national security?	0
ClaimBuster	12769				I think we have lost credibility, and I say this very honestly without any partisanship.	0
ClaimBuster	12770				I have no disagreement with the Vice President's position on that.	0
ClaimBuster	12771				But it starts with working in a collaborative effort with states and local folks.	1
ClaimBuster	12772				In our administration, in my administration, we will expedite.	0
ClaimBuster	12773				And terrorist acts are such that our own United States Capitol in Washington has been bombed twice.	1
ClaimBuster	12774				And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	12775				2nd thing, there are not many times in your life when you get to talk to a whole country.	0
ClaimBuster	12776				You know a major difference in this campaign is that Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making.	0
ClaimBuster	12777				But again it's almost like an ad hoc foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	12778				And I believe that we will be able to get a fix that has alluded everybody else because we know how to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	12779				There've been more disputes in its area where there's more volatility than any other place in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	12780				There is no question that we face this massive deficit, and almost everybody agrees unless we get it down, the chances for long-term, healthy growth are nil.	0
ClaimBuster	12781				What's a question I think the -- the president will have a chance to answer right now.	0
ClaimBuster	12782				And it would involve a religious test for the first time in American life.	1
ClaimBuster	12783				That's not what I do as president, that's not what I do as Commander in Chief.	0
ClaimBuster	12784				And it hasn't been finished at all.	1
ClaimBuster	12785				I don't think most people do.	0
ClaimBuster	12786				When I took aver we had uh a bureaucratic mess, like we have in Washington now, and we had three hundred agencies, departments, bureaus, commissions - uh some uh - fully budgeted, some not, but all having responsibility to carry out that was in conflict.	1
ClaimBuster	12787				If they're space weapons, I assume they'll be in space.	0
ClaimBuster	12788				If I'm poor and you're rich, and I can get you to defend me, that's good.	0
ClaimBuster	12789				Well, Mr. Nixon uh- I'll just give you the testimony of Mr. George Aiken - Senator George Aiken, the ranking minority member - Republican member - and former chairman of the Senate Agricultural Committee testifying in 1959 - said there were twenty-six million Americans who did not have the income to afford a decent diet.	1
ClaimBuster	12790				I think science is real.	0
ClaimBuster	12791				But, look, Cindy and I are adoptive parents.	1
ClaimBuster	12792				I know what it takes to create good jobs again.	0
ClaimBuster	12793				But there's still a problem, because what happens is, those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors.	0
ClaimBuster	12794				And I strongly believe we need to keep a presence in NATO, but I'm going to be judicious as to how to use the military.	0
ClaimBuster	12795				A jury found them guilty.	1
ClaimBuster	12796				It's expressed itself in the desire of the people of Africa to be independent of Western Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	12797				I talk about strengthening the American family and it's very hard to strengthen the family if people are scared to walk down to the corner store and, you know, send their kid down to get a loaf of bread.	0
ClaimBuster	12798				And here I do have, on this particular question, a big difference with my opponent.	0
ClaimBuster	12799				A lot of folks on Medicare are out there every day making the choice between food and medicine; not poor enough for Medicare-Medicaid, not wealthy enough to buy their medicine.	1
ClaimBuster	12800				Robert Rubin looked at his plan and said it won't work.	1
ClaimBuster	12801				Remember, it's your money; it's not his money.	0
ClaimBuster	12802				Now, it is true, though, that I believe that we should have direct talks -- not just with our friends, but also with our enemies -- to deliver a tough, direct message to Iran that, if you don't change your behavior, then there will be dire consequences.	0
ClaimBuster	12803				But here's the problem: If we are giving them to oil companies, then that means that there are those who are not going to be getting them.	0
ClaimBuster	12804				I agree that we cannot commit ground forces to become involved in the quagmire of Bosnia or in the tribal wars of Somalia.	0
ClaimBuster	12805				I would like to see eventually in this country some form of universal health care, but I'm not for a government-run system.	0
ClaimBuster	12806				I said we'd get tougher with child support and child support enforcement's up 50 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	12807				And uh - I don't believe that our security would be directly threatened if the Soviet Union went uh - into Yugoslavia.	0
ClaimBuster	12808				We need the things in it that coordinate the FBI and the CIA.	0
ClaimBuster	12809				Many would trade for it.	0
ClaimBuster	12810				I didn't need anybody to tell me to go to the United Nations.	0
ClaimBuster	12811				The Governor may not have heard my uh - established criteria for the selection of a vice president, but uh - it was a well-established criteria that the person I selected would be fully qualified to be president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	12812				But, you know, if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why that $2.8 billion is on the table.	0
ClaimBuster	12813				They only added a little bit back this year because it's an election year.	1
ClaimBuster	12814				I live in a state where over half the adults have hunting or fishing licenses, or both.	1
ClaimBuster	12815				We are better off than we were four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	12816				What happens -- the money goes to them.	0
ClaimBuster	12817				And we've got to make sure that we reduce our deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	12818				We cannot afford stoppages of massive effect on the economy when we're in the terrible competition we're in with the Soviets.	0
ClaimBuster	12819				Those words, I've been hearing them for many years.	1
ClaimBuster	12820				Senator Obama twice said in debates he would sit down with Ahmadinejad, Chavez and Raul Castro without precondition.	1
ClaimBuster	12821				In other words, I have seen his program costed out to the point where it would amount to more than $300 million a year, just for the military.	1
ClaimBuster	12822				And what's happened in the meantime?	0
ClaimBuster	12823				It requires an aggressive searching out and reaching out to help people who especially need it.	0
ClaimBuster	12824				John Edwards and I support tort reform.	1
ClaimBuster	12825				But, number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan.	1
ClaimBuster	12826				He'd been in Afghanistan, went to Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	12827				We have also provided in our program for a $4 billion Community Trust Fund, and we've told you where the money is coming from.	1
ClaimBuster	12828				And I'll tell you exactly how.	0
ClaimBuster	12829				Well, John, I'm a man that's been a chief executive for ten years.	1
ClaimBuster	12830				You can't bring back jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	12831				Now that's not a flip-flop.	0
ClaimBuster	12832				That story reported several times that I would lower taxes for low and middle-income families and uh - that correction was delivered to the White House and I am sure that the president knows about this uh - correction, but he still insists uh - on repeating an erroneous statement.	1
ClaimBuster	12833				But we can and must move faster, and that's why I stand so strongly for programs that will move America forward in the sixties, move her forward so that we can stay ahead of the Soviet Union and win the battle for freedom and peace.	0
ClaimBuster	12834				"A year ago he said, ""I was right then."	1
ClaimBuster	12835				I'm going to help women in America get good work by getting a stronger economy and by supporting women in the workforce.	0
ClaimBuster	12836				My faith affects everything that I do, in truth.	0
ClaimBuster	12837				And the principles that we put in place, we also gave kids not just a graduation exam that determined whether they were up to the skills needed to -- to be able compete, but also if they graduated the quarter of their class, they got a four-year tuition- free ride at any Massachusetts public institution of higher learning.	1
ClaimBuster	12838				With all this instability and breaking into republics, and all the Middle Eastern countries going over there and shopping for weapons, we've got our work cut out for us.	1
ClaimBuster	12839				And I want them to be proud of their vote in the years ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	12840				These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.	1
ClaimBuster	12841				The President of the United States has indicated they are not within the treaty area.	1
ClaimBuster	12842				And what I want to do is continue the tax rates -- the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families.	0
ClaimBuster	12843				You said that on occasion America had dictated to other nations.	1
ClaimBuster	12844				The American people are seeing it, and I'm proud of it; that's what I'd say.	0
ClaimBuster	12845				But I don't think that the state, the Board of Regents, a Board of Education, or any state official, should try to compose that prayer for a child to recite.	0
ClaimBuster	12846				I know -- I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	12847				And for them to be able to provide nuclear technology to non-state actors, that's unacceptable.	0
ClaimBuster	12848				We will take a look.	0
ClaimBuster	12849				And just look at other countries that have tried to have federally controlled health care.	0
ClaimBuster	12850				The Soviet Union is no more and we're working with a democratic country.	1
ClaimBuster	12851				Tonight in the audience there's one elected state senator who is a Democrat, a former state-wide officer who is a Democrat, a lot of Democrats who are here in the debate to -- because they want to show their support that shows I know how to lead.	1
ClaimBuster	12852				Does that make you feel safer in America?	0
ClaimBuster	12853				But I do believe we have to help our people get ready to succeed in the 21st Century.	0
ClaimBuster	12854				He did block it, because we passed it in the United States Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	12855				In other words, if the United States is going to maintain its strength and its prestige, we must not only be strong militarily and economically, we must be firm diplomatically.	0
ClaimBuster	12856				And let me step back and tell you what I would like to do with our immigration policy broadly and include an answer to your question.	0
ClaimBuster	12857				And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.	1
ClaimBuster	12858				Since we debated 2 weeks ago, the United States and the Soviet Union have built a hundred more warheads, enough to kill millions of Americans and millions of Soviet citizens.	1
ClaimBuster	12859				I'm not sure where he's coming from.	0
ClaimBuster	12860				He was a good neighbor in Latin America because he was a good neighbor in the United States; because they saw us as a society that was compassionate, that cared about people, that was moving this country ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	12861				And so, my change had come earlier than that.	1
ClaimBuster	12862				They didn't view their service as a back-door draft.	1
ClaimBuster	12863				"Governor Romney, I genuinely believe cares about education, but when he tells a student that, you know, ""you should borrow money from your parents to go to college,"" you know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver, just don't have that option."	1
ClaimBuster	12864				It is the Bush administration that has had no new jobs in the private sector in the last 4 years.	1
ClaimBuster	12865				And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	12866				With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, it's a problem of the Constitution.	0
ClaimBuster	12867				And every defense expert I know, including people in the Pentagon itself, will tell you that given the level of defense spending and the level of defense appropriations which the Congress has now approved and the president has signed, there's no way that you can do all of these things and do them well.	0
ClaimBuster	12868				So you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal?	0
ClaimBuster	12869				Who's the best person to manage money?	0
ClaimBuster	12870				I don't think you can deny that.	0
ClaimBuster	12871				He is an indicted war criminal.	1
ClaimBuster	12872				Don't we go across state lines when we purchase other things in America?	0
ClaimBuster	12873				The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	12874				That's the access I believe is necessary, is to make sure every child learns to read, write, add and subtract early, to be able to build on that education by going to college so they can start their careers with a college diploma.	0
ClaimBuster	12875				And it is a fact that through most of these last twenty-five years the Republican leadership has opposed federal aid for education, medical care for the aged, development of the Tennessee Valley, development of our natural resources.	1
ClaimBuster	12876				I thank you for that.	0
ClaimBuster	12877				I'll keep you in suspense.	0
ClaimBuster	12878				I don't think that means you're soft on drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	12879				I think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	12880				You've got to read what he said...	0
ClaimBuster	12881				And so I've told him my opinion.	1
ClaimBuster	12882				I don't have a one of them, and I haven't taken a penny of foreign money, and I never will.	1
ClaimBuster	12883				That's the question before the American people, and only you can decide what you want, what you want this country to be, what you want to do with the future.	0
ClaimBuster	12884				I proposed, as you know, a reduction to increase the personal exemption from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	12885				Now, as a result of our taking the strong stand that we did, the civil war there was ended; and today, at least in the south of Indochina, the Communists have moved out and we do have a strong, free bastion there.	1
ClaimBuster	12886				It's a great question about Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	12887				I believe in the need for increased oil production.	0
ClaimBuster	12888				But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO?	1
ClaimBuster	12889				Four Democrats voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	12890				And certainty sometimes can get you in trouble.	0
ClaimBuster	12891				So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I'd say absolutely not.	0
ClaimBuster	12892				First of all, Russia I indicated is a geopolitical foe.	1
ClaimBuster	12893				We came into office and the Social Security Trust Fund was in great jeopardy and the President took the leadership working with the Democrats and the Republicans in Congress some tough calls were made and the Social Security Trust Fund was put back into sound, solvent condition.	1
ClaimBuster	12894				How do you make them bring the jobs back?	0
ClaimBuster	12895				You don't have anywhere to sleep.	0
ClaimBuster	12896				"We're shipping the quote, ""low paying jobs"" overseas."	0
ClaimBuster	12897				I'm -- I'm -- I'm happy.	0
ClaimBuster	12898				I believe that this country is electing more and more African Americans and Latinos and Asian Americans who are representing districts that are themselves not necessarily of a majority of their race.	0
ClaimBuster	12899				I believe that since I've been in office, there have been six or eight areas of combat evolved in other parts of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	12900				I know what it means to have a commitment to diversity.	0
ClaimBuster	12901				This one must be stepped up.	0
ClaimBuster	12902				You look at how we get to a balanced budget within eight to 10 years.	0
ClaimBuster	12903				No attack ever created a job or educated a child, or helped a family make ends meet.	0
ClaimBuster	12904				Two questions: How do you deter nuclear attack without modernizing our nuclear forces when the Soviets are modernizing and how come you spend-willing to spend a dime on something that you consider a fantasy and a fraud.	0
ClaimBuster	12905				I say the programs and the leadership that failed then is not the program and the leadership that America needs now.	0
ClaimBuster	12906				But in this case it was a nation-building exercise, and same with Haiti.	1
ClaimBuster	12907				It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment.	1
ClaimBuster	12908				On the question of the summit, I agree with the position of Mr. Nixon.	0
ClaimBuster	12909				All the people I've met who used to be on welfare who are now working and raising their children.	0
ClaimBuster	12910				There are so many things there, I don't quite know where to begin.	0
ClaimBuster	12911				You can also deduct long-term care now, so it's a good it's a good start.	0
ClaimBuster	12912				I want everybody who pays taxes to have their tax rates cut.	0
ClaimBuster	12913				I don't trust the Russians.	0
ClaimBuster	12914				That's got to be changed.	0
ClaimBuster	12915				-- we're taking advantage of our energy resources.	0
ClaimBuster	12916				And this is an example of where we are going to have to prioritize.	0
ClaimBuster	12917				I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should.	0
ClaimBuster	12918				Well, that's exactly the commitment that was made to the American people in 1980: He would never reduce benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	12919				I have -- I understand everybody in this country doesn't agree with the decisions I've made.	1
ClaimBuster	12920				We can close an achievement gap, and it starts with making sure we have strong accountability, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	12921				The other thing we have to do to save Medicare?	0
ClaimBuster	12922				Thank you very much, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	12923				And so, we have set a standard that those loans and those grants are directed to the people who otherwise could not go to college, their family incomes were so low.	0
ClaimBuster	12924				And we need to be very clear about that.	0
ClaimBuster	12925				Gene, there is a problem in the sense that there are some problem banks, and on December 19th new regulations will go into effect which will in effect give the government the responsibility to close some banks that are not technically insolvent but that are plainly in trouble.	1
ClaimBuster	12926				I don√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢t know where the vice president stands but that√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s a renewable energy source of energy.	0
ClaimBuster	12927				Iran went from zero centrifuges to develop nuclear weapons to 4,000.	1
ClaimBuster	12928				They were eventually saying, Mexican jobs will eventually come to $7.50 an hour, ours will eventually go down to $7.50 an hour.	1
ClaimBuster	12929				I do believe, however, that we can give to the president of the United States powers, in addition to what he presently has in the fact finding area, which would enable him to be more effective than we have been in handling these strikes.	0
ClaimBuster	12930				But maybe you ought to travel down there and visit them and maybe you could understand it a lot better.	0
ClaimBuster	12931				So, what I'm saying is, we are going to have to make choices.	0
ClaimBuster	12932				Lester, one thing I'd like to say.	0
ClaimBuster	12933				I would not ho- hand over these islands under any point of gun.	0
ClaimBuster	12934				Let's think it through here.	0
ClaimBuster	12935				Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life.	0
ClaimBuster	12936				We reformed our school system, and now there's an achievement gap in America that's beginning to close.	0
ClaimBuster	12937				But take a look at the Democratic convention take a look at it.	0
ClaimBuster	12938				This is the only one country he's ever known.	1
ClaimBuster	12939				Look, we, no matter what, we've got to cut spending.	0
ClaimBuster	12940				I will keep this nation strong.	0
ClaimBuster	12941				Because I'm offsetting some of the reductions with holding down some of the deductions.	0
ClaimBuster	12942				I believe the president made a huge mistake, a catastrophic mistake, not to live up to his own standard, which was: build a true global coalition, give the inspectors time to finish their job and go through the U.N. process to its end and go to war as a last resort.	1
ClaimBuster	12943				We spent a lot of money to make sure people get health care in the State of Texas, and we're doing a better job than they are at the national level for reducing uninsured.	1
ClaimBuster	12944				We ought to insist on access.	0
ClaimBuster	12945				That's a -- that's -- go to the -- please, fact checkers, get to work.	0
ClaimBuster	12946				But let me remind you, my family has suffered from drug abuse.	1
ClaimBuster	12947				We don't give away our hand before we sit down at the head table.	0
ClaimBuster	12948				They were public employment that these people who really want to get out into the private job market where there are jobs with a future.	0
ClaimBuster	12949				It is going to require a new spirit.	0
ClaimBuster	12950				Also, recently, when someone suggested that the Occupational Safety and Health Act should be abolished, Governor Reagan responded, amen.	0
ClaimBuster	12951				That's -- that's a big topic.	0
ClaimBuster	12952				Let me tell you another place to look for some savings.	0
ClaimBuster	12953				This isn't a question of a little charity for the homeless.	0
ClaimBuster	12954				They can't have an election right now.	0
ClaimBuster	12955				The rate of inflation, as announced just the other day, is under 5 percent; and the uh - 4.4 percent that was indicated at the time of the 4 percent GNP was less than the 5.4 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	12956				And every fact checker and every reporter who's looked at it, Governor, has said this is not true.	1
ClaimBuster	12957				I don't think he was misleading when he said that it was right to disarm Iraq in the spring of 2003.	0
ClaimBuster	12958				Secretary of State Colin Powell told this president the Pottery Barn rule: If you break it, you fix it.	1
ClaimBuster	12959				On this, as on so many other issues, I have a fundamental difference from the present administration.	1
ClaimBuster	12960				The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that I signed will make it possible for 25 million people to keep their health insurance when they change jobs or when somebody in their family's been sick.	1
ClaimBuster	12961				The candidate who was a candidate for the president of Brazil, took a trip to Cuba to call on Mr. Castro during the election in order to get the benefit of the Castro supporters uh - within Brazil.	1
ClaimBuster	12962				But we don't have to have - growth in spending that will blow the lid off and add to the problems of inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	12963				I doubt if they'll give me the chance, but I will drop everything and go work on it.	0
ClaimBuster	12964				I've served as the Governor of Georgia and have traveled extensively in foreign countries and South America, Central America, Europe, the Middle East and in Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	12965				And in Crawford, Texas, Jiang Zemin and I agreed that the nuclear-weapons-free peninsula, Korean Peninsula, was in his interest and our interest and the world's interest.	1
ClaimBuster	12966				It penalizes the family farmer.	1
ClaimBuster	12967				We've already 75 percent of his people.	1
ClaimBuster	12968				Let's go to the center of the bull's-eye, the core problem.	0
ClaimBuster	12969				I don't think we can do that for a few years.	0
ClaimBuster	12970				We've got communities in this country increasingly where our own kids can't afford to live in the communities that they grew up in.	0
ClaimBuster	12971				I would just like to s- add this one point.	0
ClaimBuster	12972				I want to see control of some of these projects, and I want to keep the interest rates down.	0
ClaimBuster	12973				If you raise the Medicaid to 300 percent, it provides an incentive for small businesses not to provide private insurance to their employees.	1
ClaimBuster	12974				I want to have the military keeping the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	12975				The secretary of state has appeared in the several years that he's been the secretary before eighty different uh - committee hearings in the House and in the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	12976				Too many people have been left behind.	0
ClaimBuster	12977				Well, I'm reluctant to uh comment on the recent report - I haven't read it.	0
ClaimBuster	12978				Our values must be at stake.	0
ClaimBuster	12979				I'm the first governor to clean it up.	1
ClaimBuster	12980				That's after losing 5 million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	12981				Well, is a homebuyer better off he can refinance the home, because interest rates are down?	0
ClaimBuster	12982				As a matter of fact, my opponent talks about inspectors.	1
ClaimBuster	12983				Now, here is the good news, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	12984				It's pretty clear you won't admit...	0
ClaimBuster	12985				We have low interest rates today.	1
ClaimBuster	12986				They're going to come rushing back in to Afghanistan when we go.	0
ClaimBuster	12987				I happen to believe, I want the kids that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or Title I -- these are disabled kids or -- or -- or poor kids or -- or lower-income kids, rather, I want them to be able to go to the school of their choice.	0
ClaimBuster	12988				And that's what they are.	0
ClaimBuster	12989				And I have done a lot...	1
ClaimBuster	12990				Now, we all know that we've got to do more.	0
ClaimBuster	12991				So I think step one to make sure prescription drugs is more affordable for seniors, and those are the folks who really rely upon prescription drugs a lot these days, is to reform the Medicare system, is to have prescription drugs as an integral part of Medicare once and for all.	0
ClaimBuster	12992				It not only liberated - uh black people but it also liberated the whites.	0
ClaimBuster	12993				If we assume the ah - uh - a rate of growth of our economy, equivalent to what it was during President Johnson, President Kennedy, even before the - the - the - uh wa uh - Vietnese- namese War, and if we assume that at the end of the four-year period we can cut our unemployment rate down to 4 to 4 and a half percent - under those circumstances, even assuming no elimination of unnecessary programs and assuming an increase in the ad- in the allotment of money to finance programs, increasing as the inflation rate does - my economic projections, I think confirmed by the House uh - and the Senate committees, have been with the $60 billion extra amount of money that can be spent in fiscal year '81 which will be the last year of this next term.	1
ClaimBuster	12994				He lost the Iowa caucus.	1
ClaimBuster	12995				I√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ve got to protect them.	0
ClaimBuster	12996				Let's stop, you know, playing the political game, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	12997				I'd be happy to have you take a look.	0
ClaimBuster	12998				The president made the judgment to divert forces from under General Tommy Franks from Afghanistan before the Congress even approved it to begin to prepare to go to war in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	12999				I believe the vice president was in charge of deregulation.	0
ClaimBuster	13000				Look, we've got the biggest surpluses in all of American history.	1
ClaimBuster	13001				Emphasize and subsidize modernizing plant and equipment here, not moving plants overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	13002				After the election, he'll get more backbone.	0
ClaimBuster	13003				We must have China's leverage on Kim Jong Il, besides ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	13004				That's what drug it out.	0
ClaimBuster	13005				And I have a plan that will take the catastrophic cases out of the system, off your backs, pay for it out of a federal fund, which lowers the premiums for everybody in America, makes American business more competitive and makes health care more affordable.	0
ClaimBuster	13006				"You know when members of the Republican Congress say, ""We're going to sign a no tax pledge, so that we don't ask a dime for millionaires and billionaires to reduce our deficit so we can still invest in education, and helping kids go to college."	0
ClaimBuster	13007				There should be no tests in the atmosphere; that rules out any fall-out.	0
ClaimBuster	13008				But let's take my life in perspective.	0
ClaimBuster	13009				The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2,000 -- 2,000 -- look at them, my friends.	0
ClaimBuster	13010				Now one of the reasons I was able to get so many good women to be part of that team was because of our recruiting effort.	0
ClaimBuster	13011				There will always be problems in this whole world.	0
ClaimBuster	13012				So let me -- let me just talk about this fundamental difference.	0
ClaimBuster	13013				[Applause] I propose a budget -- I have proposed a budget which would increase our nation's strength, in real terms, by double that of the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	13014				While they didn't talk at all, the fuel rods came out, the inspectors were kicked out, the television cameras were kicked out.	1
ClaimBuster	13015				"What it means is that we don't do what we've been doing, which is to say, ""Until you agree to do exactly what we say, we won't have direct contacts with you."""	0
ClaimBuster	13016				I believe it was a failure of presidential leadership not to reauthorize the assault weapons ban.	0
ClaimBuster	13017				And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down.	0
ClaimBuster	13018				I want to be able to tell my grandson when I'm in my later years that I didn't turn away from the evidence that showed that we were doing some serious harm.	0
ClaimBuster	13019				Admirals Spruance and Callins in 1955 said that we should not attempt to defend these islands, in their conference in the Far East.	1
ClaimBuster	13020				We√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢re the best and the most efficient farmers.	0
ClaimBuster	13021				I want the families to make decisions between themselves and their doctors.	0
ClaimBuster	13022				I have a record of reform, and taking on my party, the other party, the special interests, whether it be an HMO Patients' Bill of Rights, or trying to clean up the campaign finance system in -- in this country, or whether it be establishment of a 9/11 Commission, I have a long record of it.	1
ClaimBuster	13023				They don't go to war with each other.	0
ClaimBuster	13024				Today we import one million barrels from Saddam Hussein.	1
ClaimBuster	13025				So for me, I look at this as both a need to help move Pakistan in the right direction, and also to get Afghanistan to be ready, and they will be ready by the end of 2014.	0
ClaimBuster	13026				It hurts communities, because these are our first responders.	0
ClaimBuster	13027				It puts a heavy burden on a states like California.	1
ClaimBuster	13028				"And we said, ""Why not cut out the middleman?"""	0
ClaimBuster	13029				Well, here again, uh - the Panamanian question is one that's been confused by Mr. Ford.	0
ClaimBuster	13030				Mr. President, America has not dictated to other nations.	0
ClaimBuster	13031				I make no allegations about that.	0
ClaimBuster	13032				He wants to grow the government and I trust you with your own money.	0
ClaimBuster	13033				It's just clear you can go to the website and look.	0
ClaimBuster	13034				I agree with the president: when they couldn't, we should have; now that they can, they should.	0
ClaimBuster	13035				We can do it by giving them, as a start, a $5,000 refundable tax credit to go around and get the health insurance policy of their choice.	0
ClaimBuster	13036				That's not what I'm going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	13037				As well, we included South Korea, Japan and Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	13038				I think it may be necessary that we have more taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	13039				The ambassador of the United Nations went on the Sunday television shows and spoke about how --	1
ClaimBuster	13040				President Carter also has spoken of the new jobs created.	1
ClaimBuster	13041				I think it's important to foster competition inside the public schools.	0
ClaimBuster	13042				... including $3 million for an overhead projector in a planetarium in his hometown.	1
ClaimBuster	13043				And it has not been easy.	0
ClaimBuster	13044				It's going to come from the dedication, by 1984, of the excise revenues that today are being collected by the Federal Government on alcohol and tobacco.	0
ClaimBuster	13045				We've been cleaning it up for four years.	1
ClaimBuster	13046				Parents now feel like you have to compete with the mass culture in order to raise your kids with the values that you want them to have.	0
ClaimBuster	13047				But if we remain strong and resolute, we will defeat this enemy.	0
ClaimBuster	13048				Nobody would have dreamed it possible.	0
ClaimBuster	13049				... and it's a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it.	1
ClaimBuster	13050				And that's why the biggest risk we could take right now is to adopt the same failed policies and the same failed politics that we've seen over the last eight years and somehow expect a different result.	0
ClaimBuster	13051				Mr. Perot will tell you, for example, that the expert he hired to analyze his plan says that it will bring the deficit down in 5 years but it will make unemployment bad for 4 more years.	1
ClaimBuster	13052				I don't mind releasing -- I'm under a routine audit.	1
ClaimBuster	13053				Over 50 percent - 53 to be exact - percent of the tax benefits go to the 14 percent richest people in this country, and we've had a 50 percent increase in payroll deductions since Mr. Nixon went in office eight years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	13054				I don't want to go back to the Carter grain embargo on the Soviets.	0
ClaimBuster	13055				And yes, farmers are the first environmentalists.	0
ClaimBuster	13056				And we will be better off, far better off, if we stop right now, because we have more to lose in space then they do.	0
ClaimBuster	13057				Eh- He was talking about the Castro regime and what we had been eh- doing in Latin America.	1
ClaimBuster	13058				You can't expect to build an alliance when you denigrate the contributions of those who are serving side by side with American troops in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	13059				Now, that's not in my gut.	0
ClaimBuster	13060				I can only tell you that I don't think Senator Dole is too old to be president.	0
ClaimBuster	13061				There's enough money to pay seniors today in the current affairs of Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	13062				And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material.	0
ClaimBuster	13063				That's the good news, my friends.	0
ClaimBuster	13064				You weren't impressed with the fact that he --	0
ClaimBuster	13065				One of the uh - most embarrassing uh - failures of the Ford administration, and one that touches specifically on human rights, is his refusal to appoint a presidential commission to go to Vietnam, to go to Laos, to go to Cambodia and try to trade for the release of information about those who are missing in action in those wars.	1
ClaimBuster	13066				But Saddam Hussein was a unique threat.	0
ClaimBuster	13067				Well, I think they're serious.	0
ClaimBuster	13068				I don't think you have to -- shouldn't have to hire a lawyer to figure out how to get into this country legally.	0
ClaimBuster	13069				And yet, in the last nine months of this year, we've had a drop in our economic growth rather than a gain.	1
ClaimBuster	13070				Well, Mr. Nixon, to go back to 1955.	0
ClaimBuster	13071				The American people want their children educated.	0
ClaimBuster	13072				I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together.	0
ClaimBuster	13073				Thank you very, very much.	0
ClaimBuster	13074				Now, I've proposed adding two active-duty divisions to the armed forces of the United States -- one combat, one support.	1
ClaimBuster	13075				If he gets elected president, we'll start the new century without anyone in the cabinet of the President representing education in our children.	0
ClaimBuster	13076				"General Shinseki had the wisdom to say, ""You're going to need several hundred thousand troops to win the peace."""	1
ClaimBuster	13077				The living Americans today have fought harder, paid a higher price for freedom, and done more to advance the dignity of man than any people who ever lived on this earth.	0
ClaimBuster	13078				And we've got to do a lot of work in Africa to promote democracy and trade, and there are some -- Vice President mentioned Nigeria is a fledgling democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	13079				I don't know how you draw that line.	0
ClaimBuster	13080				But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.	1
ClaimBuster	13081				But it didn't mean that.	0
ClaimBuster	13082				And Senator Bob Dole is so qualified: sixteen years in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, uhh - very high responsibilities on important committees.	1
ClaimBuster	13083				Of the nine million people put to work in new jobs since I've been in office, 1.3 million of those has been among black Americans, and another million among those who speak Spanish.	1
ClaimBuster	13084				Trillion-dollar deficits for the last four years.	1
ClaimBuster	13085				This is a time -- this should have been a time for American leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	13086				His influence is strong enough today to prevent us from joi- getting the other countries of Latin America to join with us in economic quarantine.	0
ClaimBuster	13087				Well, many of the provisions in the Kassebaum bill were provisions that -- my provisions, like deductions for long-term care, making certain that self-employed people that are watching tonight can deduct not 30 percent but 80 percent of you pay for premiums.	1
ClaimBuster	13088				I've learned from them that people do have tough times.	1
ClaimBuster	13089				We're helping youngsters; we're reaching out to them.	0
ClaimBuster	13090				That's its most basic function.	0
ClaimBuster	13091				I know this to be a fact because I had one tell me last week, Senator don't cut my Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	13092				It's up to the people in this region to take control of their country.	0
ClaimBuster	13093				And - and the whole uh subject of crime is one that concerns our people very much, and I believe that the fairness of it is - is what - uh - is a - is a major problem that addresses our - our leader and this is something that hasn't been addressed adequately by - by this administration.	0
ClaimBuster	13094				But I know, as I think you do, that our country is strongest when we lead the world, when we lead strong alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	13095				And that's what I intend to do as president.	0
ClaimBuster	13096				Do you know who J. Danforth was, he was a man who gave his life in World War II, so ridiculing a person's name is a little beneath this process.	1
ClaimBuster	13097				It's very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go uncollected.	0
ClaimBuster	13098				And I just had to work that in.	0
ClaimBuster	13099				The way you get a better America is to balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment; to give a targeted tax cut -- and let me talk about the education tax cut -- to let people have a $10,000 deduction for the cost of college tuition in any year, any kind of college tuition; to give families a tax credit, a dollar for dollar reduction in their taxes for the cost of a typical community college so we can open that to everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	13100				But it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done.	0
ClaimBuster	13101				But if you can check up on them, that's real power.	0
ClaimBuster	13102				When I came into office, we were still bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan had been drifting for a decade.	1
ClaimBuster	13103				But I think the feeling is misplaced.	0
ClaimBuster	13104				If you're going to die, you don't have to go through this ten-year cycle that FDA goes through on new drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	13105				And yet my faith and confidence in the American future is undiminished.	0
ClaimBuster	13106				I think he made my case.	0
ClaimBuster	13107				All that I can say is this: we do have programs in all of these fields - education, housing, defense - that will move America forward.	0
ClaimBuster	13108				I mean, I -- because I think whoever is the president must guard your liberties, must not erode your rights in America.	0
ClaimBuster	13109				I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	13110				First of all, the people of my state have let me be their governor for 12 years because I made commitments to 2 things -- more jobs and better schools.	1
ClaimBuster	13111				We ought to be a beacon for nations who search for peace and who search for freedom, who search for individual liberty, who search for basic human rights.	0
ClaimBuster	13112				What I want the President to do, and I think he may have done it, his last statement, call for an unconditional end of the violence and have the parties keep on talking as they should talk and have a resolution.	0
ClaimBuster	13113				Now, we need a tight budget, but there's no question that this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life, and they're hurting.	0
ClaimBuster	13114				Well, just briefly, I - I think this is uh - the second time that General Brown has made a statement that - for which he did have to apologize.	1
ClaimBuster	13115				Who fought against wasteful and earmark spending?	0
ClaimBuster	13116				Number two, I will not reduce the share paid by high-income individuals.	0
ClaimBuster	13117				You know, four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	13118				Whatever is brought in, I think that we can finance essential programs within a balanced budget, if business remains orderly.	0
ClaimBuster	13119				So why aren't you putting money into your own campaign?	0
ClaimBuster	13120				And he was down there fighting against imperialism.	1
ClaimBuster	13121				As I uh - related a moment ago, the President has always indicated that we must not make the mistake in dealing with the dictator of indicating that we are going to make a concession at the point of a gun.	1
ClaimBuster	13122				We're no longer respected in a showdown vote in the United Nations or in - in any other international council we're lucky to get 20 percent of the other nations to vote with us.	1
ClaimBuster	13123				Most small businesses are Subchapter S corps.	1
ClaimBuster	13124				The all- time low in our country was the Judge Thomas-Anita Hill hearings, and those senators ought to be hanging their heads in shame for what they did there.	0
ClaimBuster	13125				First of all, he's wrong in thinking th- er- even suggesting that Mr. Khrushchev might have continued the conference if we had expressed regrets.	0
ClaimBuster	13126				And it's important for them.	0
ClaimBuster	13127				Let's look at the vote on the Congo, the vote was seventy to nothing against the Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	13128				There has been five or six of them and if you wait long enough, there will probably be another one.	1
ClaimBuster	13129				But in the process of that we have saved uhh - $9 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	13130				Senator Obama likes to talk loudly.	0
ClaimBuster	13131				And we will take care of Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	13132				"And I only hope that, should I win this election, that I could approach President Eisenhower in maintaining the dignity of the office; in seeing to it that whenever any mother or father talks to his child, he can look at the man in the White House and, whatever he may think of his policies, he will say: ""Well, there is a man who maintains the kind of standards personally that I would want my child to follow."""	0
ClaimBuster	13133				Let's get back to Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	13134				I'm sorry, you actually -- there was a -- there was an effort on the part of the president to have a status of forces agreement, and I concurred in that, and said that we should have some number of troops that stayed on.	1
ClaimBuster	13135				Secondly, the relations between Russia and China.	0
ClaimBuster	13136				First of all, there are two different things.	0
ClaimBuster	13137				Like Mr. Perot, I am concerned about the deficits and $150 billion is a lot of money, but it's awful hard to say we're going to go out and spend more money when we're trying to get the deficit down.	0
ClaimBuster	13138				And it's the right cause.	0
ClaimBuster	13139				When Guinea became independent, the Soviet Ambassador showed up that very day.	1
ClaimBuster	13140				Now, looking at the other parts of the world - South America - talking about our record and the previous one.	0
ClaimBuster	13141				Now, Japanese couldn't unload the cars in this country if they had the same restrictions we had, and on and on and on and on and on.	1
ClaimBuster	13142				In fact, some T-shirts that are very...	0
ClaimBuster	13143				As soon as I became president, I initiated a meeting with the NATO heads of state and met with them in Brussels to discuss how we could improve the re- defense relationship in Western Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	13144				So I think we are going to have to change and strengthen the pension requirements on private retirement plans.	0
ClaimBuster	13145				That can't -- that can't be left to stand.	0
ClaimBuster	13146				And that issue, very simply stated, is this: how can we keep the peace - keep it without surrender?	0
ClaimBuster	13147				Some kid who feels like -- doesn't matter where the gun comes from, it could be a cheap gun, expensive gun.	0
ClaimBuster	13148				We had to make cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	13149				That this was an act of terror and I also said that we're going to hunt down those who committed this crime.	1
ClaimBuster	13150				This is not research, Mr President, these are the government investing in companies.	1
ClaimBuster	13151				And -- and what's at stake here is one of two things, either Candy -- this blows up the deficit because keep in mind, this is just to pay for the additional spending that he's talking about, $7 trillion - $8 trillion before we even get to the deficit we already have.	1
ClaimBuster	13152				But let me tell you specifically what my plan does.	0
ClaimBuster	13153				And we have proven, I think very conclusively, that you can reduce the rate of inflation and increase jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	13154				That's what reporters called it.	1
ClaimBuster	13155				Or whether it be Nixon's trip to China, which was preceded by Henry Kissinger, many times before he went.	1
ClaimBuster	13156				Four years ago you took me on faith.	1
ClaimBuster	13157				And crippling sanctions are something I called for five years ago, when I was in Israel, speaking at the Herzliya Conference.	1
ClaimBuster	13158				And, you know, I just want everybody to go Google it.	0
ClaimBuster	13159				But, I've learned in this last three and a half years that when an issue is extremely difficult, when the call is very close, the chances are the experts will be divided almost 50-50.	0
ClaimBuster	13160				We've also seen a very serious uh - problem with the so-called Sonnenfeldt document, which apparently Mr. Ford has just endorsed, which said that there's an organic linkage between the Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	13161				Where every eight-year-old can read.	0
ClaimBuster	13162				Let's take all these four years in a row.	0
ClaimBuster	13163				That costs the government $7,700 per family.	1
ClaimBuster	13164				I am sure that that will not happen.	0
ClaimBuster	13165				I signed a bill that puts CHIPS in place.	1
ClaimBuster	13166				I just do want to say one thing, however.	0
ClaimBuster	13167				Andrea, I think we both have a responsibility to try to address the issues.	0
ClaimBuster	13168				Crime has come down the last 2 years, for the first time in many, many decades that it has come down -- or since we've kept records -- 2 consecutive years, and last year it came down the biggest drop in crime that we've had.	1
ClaimBuster	13169				We need a million-man active reserve that could be called up on an instant's notice, and that would be also trained, ready to use that type of equipment.	0
ClaimBuster	13170				That deficit is ruining the long-term hopes for this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	13171				I will make a flat statement: The United States of America has no long-term designs on staying in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	13172				So we have a very robust set of plans.	0
ClaimBuster	13173				Now that's not a government takeover.	0
ClaimBuster	13174				He's the only president to have incomes of families go down for the last three years; the only president to see exports go down; the only president to see the lowest level of business investment in our country as it is today.	1
ClaimBuster	13175				I would like to point out that when we look at our programs in Latin America, we find that we have appropriated five times as much for Latin America as was appropriated by the previous Administration; we find that we have two billion dollars more for the Export-Import Bank; we have a new bank for Latin America alone of a billion dollars; we have the new program which was submitted at the Bogota Conference - this new program that President Eisenhower submitted, approved by the last Congress - for five hundred million dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	13176				It's a very tense situation there.	0
ClaimBuster	13177				I am very careful in public life about dealing with classified information.	0
ClaimBuster	13178				And the answer is, yes, if I'm president, America will be very strong.	0
ClaimBuster	13179				But I - I hope to have a complete uh responsibility on my shoulders to help bring about a - a fair uh - criminal justice system and also to - to bring about uh - an end to the - to the divise- divisiveness that has occurred in our country uh as a result of the Vietnam War.	0
ClaimBuster	13180				Senator McCain talks a lot about drilling, and that's important, but we have three percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.	1
ClaimBuster	13181				I learned that the hard way and the Governor and I both supported slipping the COLAs for one year.	1
ClaimBuster	13182				There is another point that should be made.	0
ClaimBuster	13183				And it seems to me that when you make a decision, the decision is made by the President of the United States, by the Commander-in-Chief.	1
ClaimBuster	13184				This is the first time the United States of America has ever had a tax cut when we're at war.	1
ClaimBuster	13185				A good family is a place where love and discipline and good values are transmuted (sic) from the elders to the children, a place where people turn for refuge, and where they know they're the most important people in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	13186				We do need to look at our records.	0
ClaimBuster	13187				The New York Times actually wrote an article about it, but they don't even care.	1
ClaimBuster	13188				I think we should have an educational system second to none.	0
ClaimBuster	13189				Let me tell you one thing I didn't sign, and I think it shows the difference of our opinion -- the difference of opinions.	0
ClaimBuster	13190				I think it's time for them to fish or cut bait.	0
ClaimBuster	13191				If you forecast it out, we still have a significant deficit under each of their plans, as I understand them.	0
ClaimBuster	13192				It's probably the worst one of all.	0
ClaimBuster	13193				We can do that by reducing Federal taxes as I proposed uh - about a year ago when I called for a tax reduction of $28 billion - three-quarters of it to go to private uh taxpayers and uh one-quarter to the business sector.	1
ClaimBuster	13194				He can make any excuse he wants, but the facts are that we're reducing the number of uninsured percentage of our population.	1
ClaimBuster	13195				The chairman of the Republican Party thinks we ought to change a few things.	1
ClaimBuster	13196				You've got cross-border attacks against U.S. troops.	1
ClaimBuster	13197				I come from a different point.	0
ClaimBuster	13198				I wanted to get something done.	0
ClaimBuster	13199				Sorry, but that's just not -- that's just not the facts.	0
ClaimBuster	13200				Why didn't you add other things into the deal?	0
ClaimBuster	13201				No, we need a chief executive who is prepared to lead; who won't blame the Congress; who will lead to bring down that deficit, who will make tough choices on spending	0
ClaimBuster	13202				And that's the difference between the president and me.	0
ClaimBuster	13203				Well, I have a different view.	0
ClaimBuster	13204				I thought I owed that to you and I respect you for being here and for the impact you've had on making this a more positive experience.	0
ClaimBuster	13205				We have to be able to make a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	13206				It would be neat and plausible and wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	13207				Then the Embassy was blown up a few weeks ago, and once again none of the steps that should have been taken were taken.	1
ClaimBuster	13208				We just don't want to see it creep back up.	0
ClaimBuster	13209				The Soviet Union may not agree to an inspection system.	0
ClaimBuster	13210				The United States today, according to Prime Minister Rabin of Israel, is a- at a peak in its uh - influence and power in the Middle East.	1
ClaimBuster	13211				It's something that we pay into now so that we will have a secure retirement, and our parents and grandparents will have a secure retirement.	0
ClaimBuster	13212				I have -- was fought for a very strong title in the farm bill for the conservation reserve program to set aside millions of acres of land to help improve wildlife and the habitat.	1
ClaimBuster	13213				And it starts with making sure we rebuild our military power.	0
ClaimBuster	13214				And I've never wavered in my life.	0
ClaimBuster	13215				And we can do it.	0
ClaimBuster	13216				That's part of an overall overhaul.	0
ClaimBuster	13217				I have never said that I object to nuclear waste.	1
ClaimBuster	13218				Thank you Kerry for your question, it's an important one.	0
ClaimBuster	13219				And, you know, that's -- you're right.	0
ClaimBuster	13220				We are 2nd in tax burden, the 2nd lowest tax burden in the country.	1
ClaimBuster	13221				And I'm so glad I did it.	0
ClaimBuster	13222				If you want to participate in some of the dynamic changes that are going on in our country, you will get specific help in doing that.	0
ClaimBuster	13223				Let me come back and say, why is it that I don't want to raise taxes?	0
ClaimBuster	13224				And here you've got, for the disadvantaged children, you've got to have early childhood development.	0
ClaimBuster	13225				They can buy a computer for their kid who's going off to college, which means they're spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers.	1
ClaimBuster	13226				More sometimes than people in foreign countries.	0
ClaimBuster	13227				The governor proposes $45 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	13228				And perhaps that's another thing we can depoliticize.	0
ClaimBuster	13229				A tax increase, a tax on everybody in America.	1
ClaimBuster	13230				I retract nothing that I have said.	0
ClaimBuster	13231				Now there are some 10,000 centrifuges spinning uranium, preparing to create a nuclear threat to the United States and to the world.	1
ClaimBuster	13232				Yes, I'm very embarrassed by it.	0
ClaimBuster	13233				And the vast majority of all family businesses would be completely exempt, and all of the others would have sharply reduced.	1
ClaimBuster	13234				The person responsible for domestic economic policy in my administration will be Bill Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	13235				Use--work internationally to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	13236				I never got to say that.	0
ClaimBuster	13237				I can't fix the statistics.	0
ClaimBuster	13238				We are spending a fortune doing it.	1
ClaimBuster	13239				And we put up with that.	0
ClaimBuster	13240				First of all, Governor Romney talks about small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	13241				They have done a good job in integrating the money supply with the uh - fiscal policy of the uh - executive and legislative branches of the government.	0
ClaimBuster	13242				In public education when we just move children through the schools.	0
ClaimBuster	13243				We're talking about Joe the plumber.	0
ClaimBuster	13244				Now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no Al Qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	13245				Let me make one last point.	0
ClaimBuster	13246				Then when I had 2 people imprisoned in Iran, I could have left them there.	0
ClaimBuster	13247				The president actually cut the money for it.	1
ClaimBuster	13248				And when they decide not to plow a field that is vulnerable to soil erosion, that may cost them a little money, but it helps the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	13249				So I have confidence that General Petraeus, working with the Pakistanis, working with the Afghans, doing the same job that he did in Iraq, will again.	0
ClaimBuster	13250				We have spent $4 trillion worth.	1
ClaimBuster	13251				I'm not just saying this.	0
ClaimBuster	13252				He introduced or supported legislation back then that suggested that kids of Massachusetts should be exempt from going overseas in that war.	1
ClaimBuster	13253				In the Oval Office, you can't predict what kind of crisis is going to come up.	0
ClaimBuster	13254				Sometimes people feel a little uncomfortable talking about this, but it's much clearer for me now.	0
ClaimBuster	13255				We need higher teachers' salaries.	0
ClaimBuster	13256				"They passed the resolution that said, ""Disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences."""	1
ClaimBuster	13257				Now, I'll go beyond that and say I think we need much more focus on rural economic development programs.	0
ClaimBuster	13258				I've never seen such ideological squabbles in the Congress of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	13259				The rest of them know we're after them.	1
ClaimBuster	13260				So I went to the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	13261				I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	13262				We hadn't done the work that ought to be done.	0
ClaimBuster	13263				The military's job is to win the war.	0
ClaimBuster	13264				But it's an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off we're going to be.	0
ClaimBuster	13265				There's a difference between being a quarterback and a cheerleader, and when there's a real problem, a President must confront it.	0
ClaimBuster	13266				In the Africa south of the Sahara, which is the major new section, we have less students from all of Africa in that area studying under government auspices today than from the country of Thailand.	1
ClaimBuster	13267				And I supported a big expansion in safe and drug-free schools program to support things like the DARE program because I thought all those things were very important.	1
ClaimBuster	13268				He repeated that error in 1959, in the speech that he made.	1
ClaimBuster	13269				And if Mr. Carter alleges that His Holiness by signing that has done it, he is totally inaccurate.	0
ClaimBuster	13270				We've had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated.	1
ClaimBuster	13271				I do think it's fair to note -- he can rebut it -- but Arkansas is one of the few states that doesn't have any civil rights legislation.	1
ClaimBuster	13272				Encouragement by the president for people to uh voluntarily conserve - yes.	0
ClaimBuster	13273				I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.	0
ClaimBuster	13274				He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs.	0
ClaimBuster	13275				There are actually more people in government except for people in defense related jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	13276				We need to make it very clear -- whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else -- the United States has much greater capacity.	0
ClaimBuster	13277				Jim, if I -- if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it.	1
ClaimBuster	13278				And I believe, for example, that there is a right of privacy in the Fourth Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	13279				If they weren't willing to work a deal, then we could have put sanctions together.	0
ClaimBuster	13280				24 years ago I supported full public financing of all federal elections.	1
ClaimBuster	13281				So the fact of the matter is that if I occasionally have mistaken your policies for George Bush's policies, it's because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities, you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	13282				If his record is the opposite of that, that means that he doesn't want to go into it.	0
ClaimBuster	13283				These are small -- these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	13284				Instead of high unemployment, we now have the lowest African-American unemployment, the lowest Latino unemployment ever measured.	1
ClaimBuster	13285				But we'll get the rest of that tax relief.	0
ClaimBuster	13286				We haven't been paying attention to them.	0
ClaimBuster	13287				But is that really the question that should be asked?	0
ClaimBuster	13288				His program under Social Security, would require everybody who had Social Security to take government health insurance whether he wanted it or not.	1
ClaimBuster	13289				We have one of the most advanced patient's bill of rights.	1
ClaimBuster	13290				Seventeen million Americans, who live over sixty-five on an average Social Security check of about seventy-eight dollars a month, they're not able to sustain themselves individually, but they can sustain themselves through the social security system.	1
ClaimBuster	13291				Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced.	0
ClaimBuster	13292				You have to earn that respect.	0
ClaimBuster	13293				The other thing, I'm extremely underleveraged.	0
ClaimBuster	13294				And then when you add in his other spending proposals, regrettably you end up socking it to the working man.	0
ClaimBuster	13295				Then that would give us ten years to do with Medicare what we're going to do with Social Security; have a bipartisan group look at what we have to do to save it when the baby boomers retire.	0
ClaimBuster	13296				"And it used the term ""death of the unborn child.''"	1
ClaimBuster	13297				I think, as technology improves, we'll be able to do even better with that.	0
ClaimBuster	13298				One more time you've bought a front-row box seat and got a third-rate performance.	0
ClaimBuster	13299				Folks, the test is not if you've added money; the test is that you've done everything possible to make America secure.	0
ClaimBuster	13300				So, I'm for continued research, but I also want strong conventional forces.	0
ClaimBuster	13301				Now, what is true is that Senator McCain and I have a difference in terms of the need to invest in America and the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	13302				I want to thank Arizona State as well.	0
ClaimBuster	13303				The Federal Reserve has uh - an independent status that ought to be preserved; I think that Mr. uh - Burns did take a typical, erroneous Republican attitude in the 1973 year when inflation was so high.	1
ClaimBuster	13304				Why didn't we bring students over here?	0
ClaimBuster	13305				Already, we have a recovery that has been going on for about 21 months to the point that we can now call it an expansion.	1
ClaimBuster	13306				And we can create more jobs there in a hurry than any other place.	0
ClaimBuster	13307				Well, I've expressed my heartfelt difference with Governor Clinton on organizing demonstrations while in a foreign land against your country, when young ghetto kids have been drafted and are dying.	1
ClaimBuster	13308				If we could have intervened effectively in the Holocaust, who among us would say that we had a moral obligation not to go in?	0
ClaimBuster	13309				The problem is that he's been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasn't been able to identify them.	1
ClaimBuster	13310				He trusts the government to order a woman to do what it thinks she ought to do.	0
ClaimBuster	13311				"A few years ago when he came to office, the president said -- these are his words -- ""What we need are some good conservative judges on the courts."""	1
ClaimBuster	13312				And part of that is bringing in a pipeline of oil from Canada, taking advantage of the oil and coal we have here, drilling offshore in Alaska, drilling offshore in Virginia where the people want it.	0
ClaimBuster	13313				Drug therapies are replacing a lot of medicines as we used to know it.	1
ClaimBuster	13314				Everybody that pays taxes is going to get tax relief.	0
ClaimBuster	13315				And I said that I felt that rather than tell the lie which we told, rather than indicate that the flights would continue - in fact, I believe Mr. Nixon himself said on May fifteenth that the flights would continue even though Mr. Herter testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that they had been canceled as of May twelfth - that it would have been far better that if we had expressed regrets, if that would have saved the summit, and if the summit is useful - and I believe it is.	1
ClaimBuster	13316				But some way or other, there were 12 of the original copies that got out down there and were not submitted for this printing process by the CIA.	1
ClaimBuster	13317				And it's also regulatory reform.	0
ClaimBuster	13318				Being lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	13319				So, we have to make decisions based upon uncertainty, and that means a strong military.	0
ClaimBuster	13320				I believe America is safest and strongest when we are leading the world and we are leading strong alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	13321				It hasn't produced a quart of oil or a lump of coal, or anything else in the line of energy.	1
ClaimBuster	13322				No, of course not, absolutely not, I want them to be tougher.	0
ClaimBuster	13323				I want to put money in your pocket.	0
ClaimBuster	13324				And I think that's great.	0
ClaimBuster	13325				... and a great first lady.	0
ClaimBuster	13326				I would like to point out also that senators like Henry Jackson and Hollings of South Carolina - they are taking the lead in the fight against this particular treaty.	1
ClaimBuster	13327				We have to renegotiate our trade deals.	0
ClaimBuster	13328				I don't think the government oughta do anything to encourage abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	13329				But the way to make sure our economy grows is not to raise taxes on small-business owners.	0
ClaimBuster	13330				But I'll try harder to keep it on a high plane.	0
ClaimBuster	13331				... from everything I see, has no respect for this person.	0
ClaimBuster	13332				They're running millions of dollars of ads against me.	1
ClaimBuster	13333				I'm an optimist, but we have to make the right choices, to be fiscally responsible and to create the new jobs of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	13334				- has to be taken by the Federal Government and when we took action, it had a favorable response.	0
ClaimBuster	13335				No, what I said was that, because we achieved such a rapid victory, more of the Saddam loyalists were around.	1
ClaimBuster	13336				But I do say that any statement to the effect that the Republican party is trigger-happy is belied by the record.	0
ClaimBuster	13337				They have got to bear a greater share of this load of economic assistance abroad.	0
ClaimBuster	13338				Well, as I've said, I am not an enemy of conservation.	0
ClaimBuster	13339				I've met kids in Ohio, parents in Wisconsin places, Iowa, where they're going out on the Internet to get the state-of-the-art body gear to send to their kids.	1
ClaimBuster	13340				Governor Reagan's approach to our energy policy, which has already proven its effectiveness, is to repeal, or to change substantially, the windfall profits tax - to return a major portion of $227 billion back to the oil companies; to do away with the Department of Energy; to short-circuit our synthetic fuels program; to put a minimal emphasis on solar power; to emphasize strongly nuclear power plants as a major source of energy in the future.	1
ClaimBuster	13341				Well what we do is what the Attorney-General of the United States did under the direction of the President: call in the owners of chain stores and get them to take action.	1
ClaimBuster	13342				And also the country that just freed three Americans that will help us create jobs in America because they will be a market for our goods and products without having to pay -- without us having to pay the billions of dollars -- the billion dollars and more that we've already paid.	0
ClaimBuster	13343				Now, this is guy a who, along with others, has taken great risk for great freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	13344				Employment will be up, revenues will be up.	0
ClaimBuster	13345				It seems to me that those who sit in Washington eighteen months after the incident are not the best judges of the decision-making process that had to be made by the National Security Council and by myself at the time the incident was developing in the Pacific.	0
ClaimBuster	13346				And she was fiercely independent.	0
ClaimBuster	13347				And if you want to pay for the rest of his plan, all the other spending programs, you're going to sock it to the working man.	0
ClaimBuster	13348				We've got to reduce our deficit, but we've got to do it in a balanced way.	0
ClaimBuster	13349				And I want to make sure that we are focused on those programs that work.	0
ClaimBuster	13350				And, very simply, in the inner city, they're starved -- you see, small business is the way to jump start the inner city, not --	0
ClaimBuster	13351				That is one of the major challenges and major undertakings that I will assume as the next president.	0
ClaimBuster	13352				But let's go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions.	1
ClaimBuster	13353				Employers would cover their employees, government would cover the unemployed.	0
ClaimBuster	13354				There's no doubt about it that many American people have lost their faith in government.	0
ClaimBuster	13355				It's just not the way I think and it's not my intentions and not my plan.	1
ClaimBuster	13356				I happen to believe it is.	0
ClaimBuster	13357				Let me just say categorically I'm proud of the people that come to our rallies.	0
ClaimBuster	13358				When we say we're somebody's friend, everybody has got to believe it.	0
ClaimBuster	13359				We took care of the safety issues.	1
ClaimBuster	13360				I love America just as all of you love America.	0
ClaimBuster	13361				But you've also got to show that you are prepared to bring the rest of the world in and share the stakes.	0
ClaimBuster	13362				We've never had citizenship tests in our country before, and I don't think we should have a citizenship card today.	1
ClaimBuster	13363				When you're president you expect this.	0
ClaimBuster	13364				I want the men and women of our Armed Forces to have the support they need to defend us; the support they need when they risk our lives to keep us free and to keep this country free.	0
ClaimBuster	13365				Now, there was a second phase in the Iranian affair in which we had something to do with that.	1
ClaimBuster	13366				This exciting future will not only give us more energy security, but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that we've put into effect.	0
ClaimBuster	13367				I should make it very clear that I do not think we're doing enough, that I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that we're making.	0
ClaimBuster	13368				It's very important that we not just, without thinking it through, just rush to every problem in the world and have our people torn to pieces.	0
ClaimBuster	13369				That will strengthen us and weaken them when it comes to issues like Georgia.	0
ClaimBuster	13370				And I'm not going to cede those jobs of the future to those countries.	0
ClaimBuster	13371				And part of that leadership is sending the right message to places like North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	13372				We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none.	0
ClaimBuster	13373				In fact, I've said the opposite: I will never turn the security of the United States over to any nation.	0
ClaimBuster	13374				President Eisenhower moves from the scene on January twentieth and the next four years are the critical years.	1
ClaimBuster	13375				And that was -- that was -- that was what allowed us to become the number one state in the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	13376				As we have seen tonight, foreign policy and defense policy are difficult and complex issues.	0
ClaimBuster	13377				"This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, ""You know, I alone can fix it,"" as he said on the convention stage."	1
ClaimBuster	13378				I don't believe the United States did that.	0
ClaimBuster	13379				We got rid of that; we've kept out of other wars; and certainly that doesn't indicate that we're trigger-happy.	1
ClaimBuster	13380				This idea of nation building is kind of a pejorative phrase, but think about the great conflict of the past century, World War II.	0
ClaimBuster	13381				I -- I don't think that Senator Obama understands that there was a failed state in Pakistan when Musharraf came to power.	1
ClaimBuster	13382				I don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt.	0
ClaimBuster	13383				Young people with high grades can't get a job.	1
ClaimBuster	13384				And I must say, after reading the Vice President's speech before the farmers, as he read mine, I don't believe that it's very much different from Mr. Benson's.	0
ClaimBuster	13385				If you are out of work, you have nothing to eat or you can't have medical care, or you're holding a crack baby in your arms right now, what do you do next?	0
ClaimBuster	13386				Mine has been in the executive branch.	1
ClaimBuster	13387				I exempt small businesses from having to pay into a kitty.	1
ClaimBuster	13388				You want to buy into it, you can.	0
ClaimBuster	13389				And the funny thing was that California, which is normally above the national average in inflation and unemployment, for those six years for the first time, was below the national average in both inflation and unemployment.	1
ClaimBuster	13390				But there's a larger law.	0
ClaimBuster	13391				It seems to me that to deny the responsibility of the Federal Government to do something about our crumbling cities is to deny the opportunity for one thing: To 55% of the black population of our country that is locked within the inner cities of the metropolitan areas of our country.	1
ClaimBuster	13392				And I didn't pick him because he agreed with me on everything.	0
ClaimBuster	13393				To do that we need a three-pronged attack: one is military assistance to our friends who are being pressured; secondly, a strong and sophisticated economic aid program and human rights program that offers a better life and a sharper alternative to the alternative offered by the totalitarians who oppose us; and finally, a strong diplomatic effort that pursues the possibilities of peace in the area.	0
ClaimBuster	13394				We need to give teachers the training and professional development that they need, including a paid time off to go visit the classroom of a master teacher to pick up some new skills.	0
ClaimBuster	13395				I also have had the opportunity of knowing and meeting other Communist leaders in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	13396				Well, let me just tell you before we go any further.	0
ClaimBuster	13397				That doesn't get the job done.	0
ClaimBuster	13398				The president sides with the power companies, the oil companies, the drug companies.	0
ClaimBuster	13399				We did it by taking $60 billion that was going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, and we said, let's just cut out the middleman.	1
ClaimBuster	13400				And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he's denied being for the war in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	13401				I don't want to be the world's policeman, I want to be the world's peacemaker by having a military of high morale and a military that is well-equipped.	0
ClaimBuster	13402				We have found also in our studies that in this increase in poverty, it all had to do with their private earnings.	1
ClaimBuster	13403				You have to decide whether you want to change or not.	0
ClaimBuster	13404				The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with.	0
ClaimBuster	13405				Because we've had tough aggressive trade policies, and because we've got interest rates down.	1
ClaimBuster	13406				Our country is not strong anymore; we're not respected anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	13407				Because they know as Senator Kennedy will have to know that if you do that you encourage them to more aggression.	0
ClaimBuster	13408				The notion that we would have tanks run over those young people who were in Tahrir Square, that is not the kind of American leadership that John F. Kennedy talked about 50 years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	13409				I have a record of fighting for fiscal responsibility.	1
ClaimBuster	13410				And I've met wives who are supportive of their husbands or vice versa when they finally sort of broke out and allowed themselves to live who they were, who they felt God had made them.	0
ClaimBuster	13411				And that wasn't just about a problem between Georgia and Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	13412				I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem.	1
ClaimBuster	13413				Let's not forget that our national security and our economic security go hand in hand.	0
ClaimBuster	13414				And I think that we'll have good results uh - on November the second for myself and I hope for the country.	0
ClaimBuster	13415				And it's gotten worse under President Bush over the course of the last years.	0
ClaimBuster	13416				Bring students here; let them see what kind of a country we have.	0
ClaimBuster	13417				And it's not only just America, but NATO is now helping, Jordan's helping train police, UAE is helping train police.	1
ClaimBuster	13418				It's really interesting, because the president used that very plan as a reason for seniors to accept his prescription drug plan.	1
ClaimBuster	13419				Now, some say, oh, you're a Republican, you can't be reaching out to these people.	0
ClaimBuster	13420				We cut the deficit by 60 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	13421				Secretary, is it President Obama's fault?	0
ClaimBuster	13422				It's time to have a fresh start.	0
ClaimBuster	13423				Number three, stop the federal government's program that now gives low-interest loans and job training funds to companies that will actually shut down and move to other countries, but we won't do the same thing for plants that stay here.	0
ClaimBuster	13424				And that certainly would not help us in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	13425				The -- where they're partnering so that they're designing training programs.	0
ClaimBuster	13426				Mr. Bush wants to spend billions on Star Wars.	0
ClaimBuster	13427				And, lastly, the other night on character Governor Clinton said it's not the character of the president but the character of the presidency.	1
ClaimBuster	13428				And he'll say it has something to do with Roe v. Wade, about the Illinois State Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	13429				I say if Germany can cover everybody and keep costs under inflation, if Hawaii can cover 98% of their people at lower health care costs than the rest of us, if Rochester, New York, can do it with two-thirds of the cost of the rest of it, America can do it, too.	1
ClaimBuster	13430				The opportunities for us in Latin America we have just not taken advantage of fully.	0
ClaimBuster	13431				Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade.	1
ClaimBuster	13432				I tell you one thing I'm not going to do is I'm not going to let the United States carry the burden for cleaning up the world's air.	0
ClaimBuster	13433				Let me make one other suggestion, because you're a teacher, you can have an impact on that.	0
ClaimBuster	13434				"Now, the president said, ""I'm not blocking that."""	1
ClaimBuster	13435				Mr. Ford quite often puts forward a program just as a public relations stunt, and never tries to put it through the Congress by working with the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	13436				These are the great questions: equality of education in school.	0
ClaimBuster	13437				I have a plan for Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	13438				In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	13439				It's time to get something done.	0
ClaimBuster	13440				I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	13441				The president just said that government-run health care results in poor quality.	1
ClaimBuster	13442				I might go back to one other thing.	0
ClaimBuster	13443				We have to have money to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	13444				Let me take just one question that he raises - the military strength and capability of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	13445				"And they have to live and go to bed at night thinking, ""Is this true?"	0
ClaimBuster	13446				No, I'm a gentlemen, Hillary.	0
ClaimBuster	13447				His name is Randy Ellis.	1
ClaimBuster	13448				And when I am president, I'm going to do it because we have to.	0
ClaimBuster	13449				The uh - emphasis, I think, of the - of the court system uh - should be to interpret the uh - the Constitution and the laws uh - equally between property protection and personal protection.	0
ClaimBuster	13450				And the children get lost in the process.	0
ClaimBuster	13451				But before I can do that, I must challenge the American people to change, and they must decide.	0
ClaimBuster	13452				Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives.	0
ClaimBuster	13453				Well, that's the only protection the taxpayer has against some of these reckless pork programs up there, and I'd rather be able to just line it right out of there and get on about passing some good stuff but leave out the garbage.	0
ClaimBuster	13454				I've been very careful - I have been very careful in saying that what I'm going to do is to bring Federal spending under control first.	0
ClaimBuster	13455				We say, if you get caught carrying a gun, you're automatically detained.	0
ClaimBuster	13456				But we also have to recognize that, you know, for us to get more entangled militarily in Syria is a serious step, and we have to do so making absolutely certain that we know who we are helping; that we're not putting arms in the hands of folks who eventually could turn them against us or allies in the region.	0
ClaimBuster	13457				There is the Republican Guard in Iran, which Senator Kyl had an amendment in order to declare them a sponsor of terror.	1
ClaimBuster	13458				I'm against giving anybody any kind of preference for something they're not qualified for.	0
ClaimBuster	13459				So what did we do?	0
ClaimBuster	13460				First of all, I cannot tell you how deeply I respect the belief about life and when it begins.	0
ClaimBuster	13461				And God bless the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	13462				My plan is not like anything that's been tried before.	1
ClaimBuster	13463				I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	13464				I mean, there's plenty of them that I oppose, but what I am not going to do, when we are negotiating with the Soviet Union, sitting down talking to Mr. Gorbachev about how we achieve a 50 percent reduction in our strategic weapons, I'm not going to give away a couple of aces I that very tough card game.	0
ClaimBuster	13465				And I have said again and again and again let's get off mud wrestling, let's get off personalities and let's talk about jobs, health care, crime, the things that concern the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	13466				I've said to the extent we spend federal money on disadvantaged children, we want the schools to show us whether or not the children are learning.	1
ClaimBuster	13467				We must never waver in the face of this enemy that -- these ideologues of hate.	0
ClaimBuster	13468				And I've put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort.	1
ClaimBuster	13469				America and the world are safer for it.	0
ClaimBuster	13470				Mr. Ford, again, under pressure from the atomic energy lobby, has insisted that this reprocessing or rather re-en- enrichment be done by private industry and not by the existing uh - government uh - plants.	1
ClaimBuster	13471				These people have all left.	1
ClaimBuster	13472				And the proof, the proof of whether a strategy is working or not is what the price is that you're paying at the pump.	0
ClaimBuster	13473				We're consuming 50 percent of the world's cocaine.	1
ClaimBuster	13474				You'd go broke in a hurry.	0
ClaimBuster	13475				It's a central part of dealing with weapons of mass destruction and proliferation.	0
ClaimBuster	13476				And everybody's getting a fair share -- everybody's doing a fair share, and everybody's playing by the same rules.	0
ClaimBuster	13477				That doesn't mean we have to write it into the law.	0
ClaimBuster	13478				They're dying to get the commercial airline business.	0
ClaimBuster	13479				I will put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox and protect them.	0
ClaimBuster	13480				She did call it the gold standard.	1
ClaimBuster	13481				But I have to confess that it was the first time that I really focused on it in a new way.	0
ClaimBuster	13482				That's another trillion dollars -- that's $8 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	13483				It's good to see you again, Senator Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	13484				It's not going to cost the government money.	0
ClaimBuster	13485				They're half, now of what they were when we came into office, and with my policy of getting this deficit under control, they'll be a lot less.	1
ClaimBuster	13486				And that is what every president has done, as far as I know, in the past but what every other president's has done.	0
ClaimBuster	13487				Just -- a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on American families.	1
ClaimBuster	13488				We've had the lowest rate of increase of economic growth in the last nine months of any major industrialized society in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	13489				"To me that concept is completely repugnant."""	0
ClaimBuster	13490				I do strongly support the WIC program.	0
ClaimBuster	13491				But this will be an interesting moment for the Russians to step up and lead as well.	0
ClaimBuster	13492				You are robbing the American people of their savings.	0
ClaimBuster	13493				And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn't paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he's going to do.	1
ClaimBuster	13494				Well, I must say that uh - Mr. Truman has uh - his methods of expressing things; he's been in politics for fifty years; he's been president of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	13495				I would remind Senator Kennedy of the past fifty years.	0
ClaimBuster	13496				A billion dollars more than the president recently signed into law.	0
ClaimBuster	13497				Well, that's how the commission -- bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	13498				We have gangs roaming the street.	1
ClaimBuster	13499				That line's getting a little bit old, I must say.	0
ClaimBuster	13500				We'll do whatever is necessary to be safe.	0
ClaimBuster	13501				I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real -- a really successful military operation.	0
ClaimBuster	13502				I think parents will be more involved with education when they know their children's classrooms are safe and secure as well.	0
ClaimBuster	13503				If you don't vote for me, I still want to be your president.	0
ClaimBuster	13504				But somehow in Washington today -- and I'm afraid on Wall Street -- greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption -- or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded.	0
ClaimBuster	13505				That's not how we're going to move our economy forward.	0
ClaimBuster	13506				"Will you guys give us permission to shift it over into training?"""	0
ClaimBuster	13507				I want to thank you and I want to thank everybody here tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	13508				I have talked in every speech about the fact that these are going to be very difficult times in the nineteen-sixties and that we're going to have to meet our responsibilities as citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	13509				They're having a hard time making ends meet.	0
ClaimBuster	13510				We gave it off to a slow start and a fast finish to give the economy time to recover.	1
ClaimBuster	13511				If you're a parent and you're struggling to get health insurance for your children, Senator Obama will fine you.	1
ClaimBuster	13512				Secondly -- and they're good.	0
ClaimBuster	13513				You've got to have world class teachers, world class books.	0
ClaimBuster	13514				Our military is second to none in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	13515				I believe in 1960 and sixty-one and two and three we have a rendezvous with destiny.	0
ClaimBuster	13516				So as far as the respect of our own people toward our own government, as far as participating in the shaping of uh - concepts and commitments, as far as the trust of our country among the nations of the world, as far as dependence of our country in meeting the needs and obligations that we've expressed to our allies, as far as the respect of our country - even among our potential adversaries - we are weak.	0
ClaimBuster	13517				But if you send a Republican president and a Democratic majority and the threat of a veto hangs over the Congress, in my judgment you will continue what happened in the August session, which is a clash of parties and inaction.	0
ClaimBuster	13518				And we -- we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense.	1
ClaimBuster	13519				By the way, I just found out the other day an interesting fact, that there is a national petroleum reserve right next to -- in Prudhoe Bay that your administration opened up for exploration in that pristine area.	1
ClaimBuster	13520				"First, the Joint Chiefs of Staff went to the President, said, ""Don't put those troops there.''"	1
ClaimBuster	13521				I think price controls would hurt our ability to continue important research and development.	0
ClaimBuster	13522				The Vice President is complacent, thinks we ought to stick with the status quo, doesn't think we ought to move ahead, thinking things are okay as they are.	0
ClaimBuster	13523				We need to eliminate a whole host of programs that don't work.	0
ClaimBuster	13524				I have fought against -- well, one of them would be the marketing assistance program.	1
ClaimBuster	13525				And when you do that, you've have homeless families.	0
ClaimBuster	13526				I believe it was her campaign that did it.	0
ClaimBuster	13527				That's how much I care about it.	0
ClaimBuster	13528				I understand what it takes to make a bright and prosperous future for America again.	0
ClaimBuster	13529				We didn't also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put -- put people in a position where they're going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted.	0
ClaimBuster	13530				I mentioned the radical departure of Governor Reagan from the principles or ideals of historical perspective of his own party.	1
ClaimBuster	13531				The third is medical care for the aged which is tied to Social Security, which is financed out of Social Security funds.	0
ClaimBuster	13532				Now, I believe in community policing.	0
ClaimBuster	13533				Because if they put their currency down low, that means their prices on their goods are low.	1
ClaimBuster	13534				We must not meet the Communists purely in the field of gross atheistic materialism.	0
ClaimBuster	13535				I believe those negotiations should continue.	0
ClaimBuster	13536				"Now, the conversation I had with Joe the plumber, what I essentially said to him was, ""Five years ago, when you were in a position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then."""	1
ClaimBuster	13537				The President wants to spend 20 percent more in the next six years, and I want to spend 14 percent more and give that 6 percent back to the people.	1
ClaimBuster	13538				And when you have more money in your pocket, you're able to better afford things you want.	0
ClaimBuster	13539				If you make more than $60,000 and up to 100 you'll still get a match, but not as generous.	1
ClaimBuster	13540				We've got to stop drifting.	0
ClaimBuster	13541				They concluded there was no case; he said the FBI was rigged.	1
ClaimBuster	13542				But when a man's president of the United States, or a former president, he has an obligation not to lose his temper in public.	0
ClaimBuster	13543				Four years ago you said in your first year you would file legislation.	1
ClaimBuster	13544				Which one of those promises will you keep and which will you break, Governor?	0
ClaimBuster	13545				If you want someone who will fight for you and who will fight for the middle-class families and working men and women, who are sick and tired of having their parents and grandparents pay higher prices for prescription drugs than anybody else, then I want to fight for you.	0
ClaimBuster	13546				The first priority has to be on ending the violence, dampening down the tensions that have arisen there.	0
ClaimBuster	13547				We have gone certainly the extra mile and then some in making offers to the Soviet Union on control of tests, on disarmament, and in every other way.	0
ClaimBuster	13548				The other would be to make a judgment on what's the most effective tax program to stimulate our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	13549				But she's been there for 30 years she's been doing this stuff.	1
ClaimBuster	13550				Those programs you cannot afford and give tax relief.	0
ClaimBuster	13551				They ought to factor in it when they go to the voting booth.	0
ClaimBuster	13552				It's just -- it's -- we've got -- when the president took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year, and last year slower than the year before.	1
ClaimBuster	13553				And what did we do in the late '40's and '50's and '60's?	0
ClaimBuster	13554				In other words, we've got to be tough.	0
ClaimBuster	13555				This president has taken a $5.6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see.	1
ClaimBuster	13556				Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way.	0
ClaimBuster	13557				First of all, the Soviet Union if I have been critical of some of the previous agreements, it's because we've been out-negotiated for quite a long time.	0
ClaimBuster	13558				In addition to that we've had a chance to became now, contrary to our long-standing beliefs and principles, the arms merchant of the whole world.	0
ClaimBuster	13559				They'll do fine whether you're president or I am.	0
ClaimBuster	13560				It's an issue that good people obviously disagree on.	0
ClaimBuster	13561				Of course Mr. Nixon is wholly inaccurate when he says that the Congress has not provided more funds in fact than the President recommended for national defense.	1
ClaimBuster	13562				The President's economic plan calls for increasing the taxes to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way.	1
ClaimBuster	13563				We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults.	0
ClaimBuster	13564				It's stuck in the Senate, because the trial lawyers won't act on it.	1
ClaimBuster	13565				And I'm trying to emphasize that what I want to do is to continue to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	13566				Well, I must have been living through a different eight years then the ones the vice president's been living through, because this administration has cut and slashed and cut and slashed programs for children, for nutrition, for the kinds of things that can help these youngsters to live better lives.	1
ClaimBuster	13567				Well, I'll -- I'll be very quick.	0
ClaimBuster	13568				I have actually not questioned Governor Bush's experience.	1
ClaimBuster	13569				Number two, we've got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market -- and when the market returns.	0
ClaimBuster	13570				If you look at the history of a lower court judge's rulings, you can get a pretty good idea of how they'll interpret questions.	0
ClaimBuster	13571				And in that process, they can get government help and government guarantees, but they need to go through bankruptcy to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden that they'd -- they'd built up.	1
ClaimBuster	13572				And so I refuse to measure one's commitment as to whether you're going to double the spending.	0
ClaimBuster	13573				The very minute effect of the action which has been taken this week on Cuba's economy - I believe Castro can replace those markets very easily through Latin America, through Europe, and through Eastern Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	13574				Exaggerations like, for example, only 5% of seniors receive benefits under my Medicare reform package.	1
ClaimBuster	13575				And I think it goes beyond just the response to terror.	0
ClaimBuster	13576				So I'd get rid of that one from day one.	0
ClaimBuster	13577				And we will have so many people who are qualified for the top job that it will be terrific.	0
ClaimBuster	13578				"So you say, ""Was it worth it?"""	0
ClaimBuster	13579				And so it isn't one and state governments have had a tough time.	0
ClaimBuster	13580				And this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face.	0
ClaimBuster	13581				And that's what needs to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	13582				I picked him because he was somebody who would be a strong Vice President, somebody who would be an active Vice President.	0
ClaimBuster	13583				They're now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier.	1
ClaimBuster	13584				They're good, solid men and women who have made good, sound judgments on behalf of the people of Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	13585				But what I'm not for what I'm not for is measuring it the way that the Democratic Congress does.	0
ClaimBuster	13586				But I think that's the American way.	0
ClaimBuster	13587				There were eleven dictators in South America and in Central America when we came in, in 1953.	1
ClaimBuster	13588				They will find a state -- maybe Arizona, maybe another state -- where there are no requirements for you to get cancer screenings, where there are no requirements for you to have to get pre-existing conditions, and they will all set up shop there.	1
ClaimBuster	13589				Look, our country is stagnant.	0
ClaimBuster	13590				He seems to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system; he says he's against new taxes, although he's broken that pledge at least times in the last year that I know of; he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five year, $40 billion tax break.	1
ClaimBuster	13591				And again, you might be able to make amendments all the time, Governor, but you've got to, as president, you can't be on all these different sides, and you can't have this pattern of saying well, I did this or I didn't, then the facts come out and you change it.	0
ClaimBuster	13592				I can promise you that I will try not to, and hard.	0
ClaimBuster	13593				I supported that route for some time and again I think it gets back to experience.	0
ClaimBuster	13594				I've been disturbed by the tone and the tenor of this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	13595				In fact uh - Mr. Nixon uh - discussed that a week ago in a speech.	1
ClaimBuster	13596				I am not talking of scrapping.	0
ClaimBuster	13597				We've got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers.	1
ClaimBuster	13598				And with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre-existing condition plan.	1
ClaimBuster	13599				We've got to make sure that works properly.	0
ClaimBuster	13600				And I shook hands with him on it and I appointed my members, and the commission never met.	1
ClaimBuster	13601				I'd like to come back to the question of nation building, but let me address the question directly, first.	0
ClaimBuster	13602				That's why I said tonight I'm for opportunity, responsibility and community.	0
ClaimBuster	13603				We won't be making airplanes in this country 10 years from now if we let deals like this go through.	0
ClaimBuster	13604				Well, very quickly, we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90 percent -- 90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country.	1
ClaimBuster	13605				And foreign companies are now coming in buying our -- buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil.	1
ClaimBuster	13606				I don't see this, incidentally, as a Democrat or a Republican or a liberal or conservative idea.	0
ClaimBuster	13607				And she'll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it.	0
ClaimBuster	13608				I think we can do better if we have the courage to change.	0
ClaimBuster	13609				Fourthly, I have suggested that the medical care for the aged - and the bill which the Congress now has passed and the President signed if fully implemented would cost a billion dollars on the Treasury - out of Treasury funds and a billion dollars by the states - the proposal that I have put forward and which many of the members of my party support is for medical care financed under Social Security; which would be financed under the Social Security taxes; which is less than three cents a day per person for medical care, doctors' bills, nurses, hospitals, when they retire.	1
ClaimBuster	13610				You know, you may have seen your health care premiums go up.	0
ClaimBuster	13611				I want to do that in industries, not just in Detroit, but all across the country and that means we change our tax code so we're giving incentives to companies that are investing here in the United States and creating jobs here.	0
ClaimBuster	13612				That wasn't true in his time, that's why my policy starts with a very robust policy to get all that energy in North America -- become energy secure.	0
ClaimBuster	13613				I do, and I'm standing up to the issue with an answer that's fair.	0
ClaimBuster	13614				As a matter of fact, this is a global effort.	1
ClaimBuster	13615				"But there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, ""We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby."""	0
ClaimBuster	13616				But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force.	0
ClaimBuster	13617				I'm not going to be a picker and chooser.	0
ClaimBuster	13618				I want to make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for small business, for big business, to invest and grow in America.	0
ClaimBuster	13619				It also allowed us to refocus on alliances and relationships that had been neglected for a decade.	0
ClaimBuster	13620				Because they have been hit hard over the last decade.	0
ClaimBuster	13621				Pretty simply, who's the best-qualified person up here on the stage to create jobs?	0
ClaimBuster	13622				You ought to make more decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	13623				One way, for instance, would be to have a single number.	0
ClaimBuster	13624				But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything.	1
ClaimBuster	13625				And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	13626				It would borrow up to $3 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	13627				The federal government should take no more than a third of anybody's check.	0
ClaimBuster	13628				It turned out to be a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	13629				Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle do not.	0
ClaimBuster	13630				When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious.	0
ClaimBuster	13631				And what we've seen over the last several years is Iran's influence grow.	0
ClaimBuster	13632				I'm totally focussed on the fact that we are still evading the issue of the Glaspie papers.	1
ClaimBuster	13633				And, incidentally, I might say that with regard to the 25-percent cut in Social Security -- before I get to the answer to your question -- the only 25-percent cut that I know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase, was a cut of 25 percent in the benefits for every American who was born after 1916.	1
ClaimBuster	13634				As soon as they have a change that allows the people to speak freely, they're wanting to develop some kind of blueprint that will help them be like us more, freedom, free markets, political freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	13635				"The head of the EPA said, ""You can't build a coal plant."	1
ClaimBuster	13636				And thank you to the Presidential Commission for undertaking this enormous task.	0
ClaimBuster	13637				And then just a day or two ago, the attorney general of the United States made a further investigation and came to precisely the same conclusion.	1
ClaimBuster	13638				In addition to that, we're going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early.	1
ClaimBuster	13639				For the last two years, I've been the president, and I have found from experience that it's much more difficult to make those decisions than it is to second-guess them.	1
ClaimBuster	13640				The Soviet Union has been moving faster than we have.	1
ClaimBuster	13641				Well, what about the citizen that stayed in their homes?	0
ClaimBuster	13642				Now, from the start of this campaign, I've identified this as one of my top priorities and here is what I think we have to do.	1
ClaimBuster	13643				But I believe the evidence is that our deployments have been successful, in Haiti, in Bosnia, when we moved to Kuwait to repel Saddam Hussein's threatened invasion of Kuwait.	1
ClaimBuster	13644				But that was something that happened.	1
ClaimBuster	13645				I notice particularly that he didn't endorse the Humphrey-Hawkins bill which he has on occasions and which is included as a part of the Democratic platform.	1
ClaimBuster	13646				Number one, let me just repeat, if you've got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it.	1
ClaimBuster	13647				It's because they no longer present the kind of viable economic climate that makes it possible for industry to remain there, or to locate there.	0
ClaimBuster	13648				They must continue to get those checks, and I believe that the system can be put on a sound actuarial basis.	0
ClaimBuster	13649				"This president in the last debate said, ""Well, that would be a big tax gap if we did that."""	1
ClaimBuster	13650				We do not spend a higher percentage of our income on public education than every other country.	1
ClaimBuster	13651				And therefore we passed an authorization - not an aid bill - which was the first time, really, since the Inter-American Bank which was founded a year ago was developed, that we really have looked at the needs of Latin America; that we have associated ourselves with those people.	1
ClaimBuster	13652				And that will always be the case as long as the Communists are on the international scene, in the aggressive tac- uh - tendencies that they presently are following.	0
ClaimBuster	13653				So, if he'd had his way, there wouldn't have been any housing project there at all.	0
ClaimBuster	13654				And it requires a president who is steadfast and strong and determined.	0
ClaimBuster	13655				I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	13656				Let me give you an example.	0
ClaimBuster	13657				So strong economy is very important.	0
ClaimBuster	13658				He hoped that there would be uh - b- be an agreement in part in disarmament.	0
ClaimBuster	13659				And not legislating from the bench.	0
ClaimBuster	13660				You know, I'd been in public life a long time and no one had ever questioned my role and so I was asked a lot of questions about things that happened a long time ago and I don't think I answered them as well as I could have.	1
ClaimBuster	13661				Mr. Hankins, I don't feel good about it, and I think we ought to have a patient's bill of rights to take the medical decisions away from the HMOs and give them back to the doctors and nurses.	0
ClaimBuster	13662				There are certain army bases that the act calls for that can be used in certain cases to shelter people when it's rough.	1
ClaimBuster	13663				Have you noticed, they've been in charge the last two years.	1
ClaimBuster	13664				There's -- you don't have to take my word for this.	0
ClaimBuster	13665				The man who should be here tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend.	1
ClaimBuster	13666				Tell Tony Blair we're going alone.	0
ClaimBuster	13667				It's too much to hope that this is going to continue, but I do hope that it will continue.	0
ClaimBuster	13668				But I run because I believe this year the United States has a great opportunity to make a move forward, to make a determination here at home and around the world, that it's going to reestablish itself as a vigorous society.	0
ClaimBuster	13669				They've all got a lot of anxieties out there.	0
ClaimBuster	13670				Education is how to make sure we've got a workforce that's productive and competitive.	0
ClaimBuster	13671				You say who's making these deals?	0
ClaimBuster	13672				And then we had Somalia -- then we had the first Gulf War.	1
ClaimBuster	13673				Second, as far as this report is concerned, I would have no objection to having it made public.	0
ClaimBuster	13674				And all Americans will open their wallets and their hearts to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	13675				You see that every night on television.	0
ClaimBuster	13676				They bring their crops in or their livestock in, many of them about the same time.	1
ClaimBuster	13677				You're supposed to have a government that comes from you.	0
ClaimBuster	13678				Well, bringing people together, again, is obviously a responsibility we all have.	0
ClaimBuster	13679				Cleaning up two-thirds of the worst toxic waste dumps.	0
ClaimBuster	13680				And therein, I think Governor Clinton keeps talking about trickle down, trickle down, and he's still talking about spending more and taxing more.	0
ClaimBuster	13681				But uh - Mr. Burns uh - in that respect made a very serious mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	13682				I have never made the statement that he suggested about nuclear proliferation and nuclear proliferation, or the trying to halt it, would be a major part of a foreign policy of mine.	1
ClaimBuster	13683				It is that we are continuing to spend too much.	0
ClaimBuster	13684				As Secretary Gates, the defense secretary, said, the war against terrorism began in that region and that's where it will end.	1
ClaimBuster	13685				And we're going to make sure that if they do not meet the demands of the international community, then we are going to take all options necessary to make sure they don't have a nuclear weapon.	0
ClaimBuster	13686				We still have lots of troops in Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	13687				The truth, though, is that Al Qaeda is much weaker than it was when I came into office.	1
ClaimBuster	13688				And in the long-term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy.	0
ClaimBuster	13689				In my economic plan we increase it 39percent.	1
ClaimBuster	13690				She wants to fight for rebels.	1
ClaimBuster	13691				You've had your chance and it didn't work.	0
ClaimBuster	13692				And the reason it's so difficult for schools to control that is because in recent years there has been a flood of cheap handguns that are so widely available that kids are finding ways to get ahold of them.	0
ClaimBuster	13693				But let me -- let me not just stop there.	0
ClaimBuster	13694				For many of you, it is getting harder and harder to save, harder and harder to retire.	0
ClaimBuster	13695				The same way that you said that it was mission creep to go after Gadhafi.	1
ClaimBuster	13696				And Georgia and Ukraine are both major gateways of energy into Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	13697				Isn't it time to stop creating images?	0
ClaimBuster	13698				And you see, yes, my position has evolved.	0
ClaimBuster	13699				We're America, and we believe in our future and we know we have the ability to shape our future.	0
ClaimBuster	13700				this year, a year of recovery, we find that it's six and nine-tenths per cent and one of the highest in the world today.	1
ClaimBuster	13701				See, our differences are our strengths.	0
ClaimBuster	13702				If you pay taxes, you are going to get a benefit.	0
ClaimBuster	13703				The net result is uh - we think under Carla Hills, who's the chairman of my uh - urban development and uh - neighborhood revitalization program, we will really do a first-class job in helping uh - the communities throughout the country.	1
ClaimBuster	13704				And I would just say there are three things that I would like to say -- number one -- we do have to maintain the world's strongest defense.	0
ClaimBuster	13705				I feel completely at ease knowing that someday Senator Mondale might very well be president.	0
ClaimBuster	13706				I'd like to thank the people who've started with Mr. Perot who've come on to help our campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	13707				First of all, in terms of standing up to the leaders of my party, the first major bill that I voted on in the Senate was in support of tort reform, which wasn't very popular with trial lawyers, a major constituency in the Democratic Party.	1
ClaimBuster	13708				First, let me make sure that every senior listening today understands that when we're talking about reforming Social Security, that they'll still get their checks.	0
ClaimBuster	13709				And I try not to.	0
ClaimBuster	13710				I have been fighting for very strong anti-crime legislation -- habeas corpus reform, so you don't have these endless appeals, so when somebody gets sentenced, hey, this is for real.	1
ClaimBuster	13711				Then when they get off by themselves, they say nobody did it.	0
ClaimBuster	13712				How much did you cut licenses and permits on federal land and federal waters?	0
ClaimBuster	13713				The terrorists have won each time.	0
ClaimBuster	13714				I think the President was correct in ordering these flights.	0
ClaimBuster	13715				When it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue neutral way, close loopholes, deductions -- he hasn't identified which ones they are -- but that thereby bring down the corporate rate.	1
ClaimBuster	13716				One of the reasons is we almost had it done, and the speaker -- a very, able, decent fellow, I might add -- but he twisted the arms of some of the sponsors of that legislation and had them change their vote.	1
ClaimBuster	13717				And you bet we're gonna take a trillion dollars of your own money and let you invest it under safe guidelines so you get a better rate of return on the money than the paltry 2% that the federal government gets for you today.	1
ClaimBuster	13718				I was not opposing the principle of providing care for them.	1
ClaimBuster	13719				Well, I think the national debt affects everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	13720				The litmus test that John says is in the Republican platform, says no more than the judges to be appointed should have a respect for innocent life.	0
ClaimBuster	13721				And I said it numerous times.	1
ClaimBuster	13722				And at the same time, assuming that I sign the tax bill that was mentioned by Mr. Gannon, we will in the last two tax bills have increased the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayers.	1
ClaimBuster	13723				Those are my best ideas about it.	0
ClaimBuster	13724				Any investments I have over the last eight years have been managed by a blind trust.	1
ClaimBuster	13725				... we have made environments in schools healthier for kids, including healthier lunches...	1
ClaimBuster	13726				If it's a failing school, shut it down and reopen it under a new principal with a turnaround team of specialists the way Governor Jim Hunt does in North Carolina.	1
ClaimBuster	13727				I have been in charge of this reinventing government streamlining project that's reduced the size of government by more than 300,000 people in the last several years.	1
ClaimBuster	13728				I believe very deeply that you have to be willing to stand up and fight no matter what powerful forces might be on the other side.	0
ClaimBuster	13729				Well, thank you again, Bob.	0
ClaimBuster	13730				Even FOX News disputes it, and that doesn't happen very often when it comes to accusations about me.	1
ClaimBuster	13731				And there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening, and over the course of this month we're going to have two more presidential debates and a vice presidential debate.	1
ClaimBuster	13732				Now, somebody has to bear the responsibility for this.	0
ClaimBuster	13733				And if we're fiscally responsible and put America back to work, we're going to fix Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	13734				Mr. Nixon knows very well that in this - in this whole matter that's been involved with the so-called religious discussion in this campaign, I've never suggested, even by the vaguest implication, that he did anything but disapprove it.	1
ClaimBuster	13735				And I can assure you that the United States will have the leadership role in moving toward a comprehensive settlement of the Middle Eastern problems, I hope and trust as soon as possible.	0
ClaimBuster	13736				You implement that NAFTA, the Mexican trade agreement, where they pay people a dollar an hour, have no health care, no retirement, no pollution controls, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and you're going to hear a giant sucking sound of jobs being pulled out of this country right at a time when we need the tax base to pay the debt and pay down the interest on the debt and get our house back in order.	1
ClaimBuster	13737				We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make America safe again.	0
ClaimBuster	13738				It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.	1
ClaimBuster	13739				Thirdly, in 1952, there were only seven votes in favor of the admission of Red China into the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	13740				The second part is to maintain and improve relations with our friends to the south.	0
ClaimBuster	13741				And our alliance is strong.	0
ClaimBuster	13742				Our policies are very different.	0
ClaimBuster	13743				Let me just -- I've got to answer this.	0
ClaimBuster	13744				Today we're well on our way to a 600-ship navy.	1
ClaimBuster	13745				He indicates he would not make those.	0
ClaimBuster	13746				If you're paying $12, $13, $14 an hour for a factory worker, and you can move your factory south of the border, pay $1 an hour for labor, hire a young -- let's assume you've been in business for a long time.	0
ClaimBuster	13747				You're spending millions and millions of dollars in negative ads frightening senior citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	13748				But I'll respond to a couple of things that you mentioned.	0
ClaimBuster	13749				And that's the fundamental reason why we can't let the farmer go by himself at the present time.	0
ClaimBuster	13750				In the two-hundred-year history there's been a very uh - cautious approach to this.	0
ClaimBuster	13751				I don't agree with that statement.	0
ClaimBuster	13752				And how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also, how do we have enough revenue to make those investments?	0
ClaimBuster	13753				Let's take the example of Darfur just for a moment.	0
ClaimBuster	13754				Good, I look forward to it.	0
ClaimBuster	13755				What I criticized were the policies that made it necessary to go to Korea.	1
ClaimBuster	13756				There wouldn't be time for a President to decide; it would be decided by these remote computers.	0
ClaimBuster	13757				I reject this notion -- and I'm suggesting my opponent isn't -- I reject the notion that some say that if you're Muslim you can't free, you don't desire freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	13758				Decide who you think will do the job.	0
ClaimBuster	13759				And we control private and public health care costs.	1
ClaimBuster	13760				Secondly, we have to increase our exports, as compared with our imports.	0
ClaimBuster	13761				Now we need to focus on what do we need to do to be better off still.	0
ClaimBuster	13762				That has to be our biggest national security priority.	0
ClaimBuster	13763				We need moms and dads, helping to raise kids.	0
ClaimBuster	13764				We have gone from the biggest deficits eight years ago to the biggest surpluses in history today.	1
ClaimBuster	13765				I believe we ought to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund to -- with half the money going to states so states can make the right decisions for environmental quality.	0
ClaimBuster	13766				A lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy.	0
ClaimBuster	13767				But back then we had planes that couldn't fly for lack of spare parts or pilots.	1
ClaimBuster	13768				He says he's going to give you tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	13769				And they installed a Marxist-Leninist totalitarian government.	1
ClaimBuster	13770				He voted against these programs, he does not believe it.	1
ClaimBuster	13771				She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great.	1
ClaimBuster	13772				The best thing to do is to look at the record uh - of Mr. Ford's Administration and Mr. Nixon's before his.	0
ClaimBuster	13773				You know, last year up to this time, we've lost 700,000 jobs in America.	1
ClaimBuster	13774				So I favor closing the gun show loophole.	0
ClaimBuster	13775				I've said it before, I say it again: I believe the president broke faith with the American people in the way that he took this nation to war.	1
ClaimBuster	13776				It was not my administration that put the sanctions on Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	13777				I was against the war in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	13778				I do not agree with that point of view.	0
ClaimBuster	13779				We haven't gotten either the economies in Government that were promised; we haven't gotten the 4% inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of Mr. Carter's first term.	1
ClaimBuster	13780				It has doubled over the last eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	13781				Well, look at the budget.	0
ClaimBuster	13782				What troubles me is that when I talk of the voluntary sector and a thousand points of light and a thousand different ways to help on these problems, the man has just said he doesn't understand what I'm talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	13783				I remember driving down the California coast one day.	0
ClaimBuster	13784				When it comes to timetables it can't be the United States timetable as to how discussions take place.	0
ClaimBuster	13785				Number two, I believe that if any economic sanctions against Latin America are going to be successful they have to be multilateral.	0
ClaimBuster	13786				Matter of fact, we distributed free trigger locks in the State of Texas so that people can get them and put them on their guns to make their guns more safe.	1
ClaimBuster	13787				And people are beginning to educate through this program, teaching these kids you shouldn't use drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	13788				Well can I have the last word on this?	0
ClaimBuster	13789				The president reversed it publicly while the president of South Korea was here.	1
ClaimBuster	13790				I am simply saying that I believe that that's where the effort should be directed -- to make that determination.	0
ClaimBuster	13791				Now, we have come back from that abyss.	1
ClaimBuster	13792				Russia is still very unstable; they could go back to square one, and worse.	0
ClaimBuster	13793				The governor talked about Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	13794				I notice you bring that up a lot.	1
ClaimBuster	13795				It's one of the best schools in Houston.	1
ClaimBuster	13796				And we've cut them 18 times.	1
ClaimBuster	13797				But, I think that that is clearly related to the fact that, going back to the time when the all-volunteer Army was created in 1973 - and I worked hard for it and supported it - we simply have failed to keep pace with the cost of living.	1
ClaimBuster	13798				And I think that this problem has become so severe, as you know, that we're going to have to do something about home values.	0
ClaimBuster	13799				Well, I think age is very -- you know, wisdom comes from age, experience and intelligence.	0
ClaimBuster	13800				You cannot solve a problem unless you diagnose the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	13801				They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.	1
ClaimBuster	13802				If they had that money without those government restrictions, every one of them has told me they could make great savings and make far greater use of the money.	0
ClaimBuster	13803				You even brought some right-wing congressman into the White House to plot how to attack me for going to Russia in 1969-70, when over 50,000 other Americans did.	1
ClaimBuster	13804				And it's going to be tough.	0
ClaimBuster	13805				He's going to do -- and he would do for the US what he's done to Arkansas.	0
ClaimBuster	13806				But we have an employer-based system.	0
ClaimBuster	13807				John claims that he is making plain where the money will come from.	0
ClaimBuster	13808				Now, we have a choice here.	0
ClaimBuster	13809				I don't think in racial harmony that I'm a laggard on that.	0
ClaimBuster	13810				For the first four years -- it takes a year to pass it and for the first four years only the poor are covered.	1
ClaimBuster	13811				And the reason it's that important is that all of the other issues, whether prescription drugs for all seniors that are opposed by the drug companies or the patient's bill of rights to take the decisions away from the HMOs and give them to the doctors and nurses, opposed by the HMOs and insurance companies, all these other proposals are going to be a lot easier to get passed for the American people if we limit the influence of special interest money and give democracy back to the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	13812				We've got to put our house in order.	0
ClaimBuster	13813				And they'll gridlock right at that point because for example, we've got international competitors who simply could not unload their cars off the ships if they had to comply -- you see, if it was a 2-way street, just couldn't do it.	1
ClaimBuster	13814				Nobody's ever seen numbers like this for health care.	1
ClaimBuster	13815				The individual who wants to start a business or expand his business as a black businessman is able to borrow, either directly or with guaranteed loans.	1
ClaimBuster	13816				It's about where we are now.	0
ClaimBuster	13817				That's Social Security and Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	13818				And you ought to have some of this surplus so you can save and dream and build.	0
ClaimBuster	13819				I don't believe that the Rumanians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	13820				And what's happening is the level of pollution is increasing significantly.	1
ClaimBuster	13821				I have had a chance to work with him and Alan Greenspan and others on the crisis following the collapse of the Mexican peso.	1
ClaimBuster	13822				We should have taken a leading role, not militarily, but a leading role organizationally, governmentally to bring together the parties; to find responsible parties.	0
ClaimBuster	13823				If you change your job, you're going to be covered.	1
ClaimBuster	13824				So my view is the middle class is the -- they've been suffering, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	13825				And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that's what you're getting with her.	0
ClaimBuster	13826				The second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas.	1
ClaimBuster	13827				I have a plan to let you buy into the same health care senators and congressmen give themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	13828				And I will address you as Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	13829				We made the embargo tougher but we increased contacts people to people with the Cubans, including direct telephone service, which was largely supported by the Cuban-American community.	1
ClaimBuster	13830				We can't get involved in the quagmire, but we must do what we can.	0
ClaimBuster	13831				And I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you.	0
ClaimBuster	13832				This is an arms escalation.	0
ClaimBuster	13833				I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office.	1
ClaimBuster	13834				And I'm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	13835				... as he has campaigned for me around the country, you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America.	1
ClaimBuster	13836				The average family is paying an additional $900 a year in higher premiums because of the uninsured.	1
ClaimBuster	13837				And when the Vice President talks about liberals on the Bench, I wonder who he's talking about?	0
ClaimBuster	13838				We need to stop this proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	13839				They're all patriots but you've got to link arms and work with them.	0
ClaimBuster	13840				Senator McCain is proposing -- and this is a fundamental difference between us -- $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	13841				I agree with everything she said.	0
ClaimBuster	13842				And I don't believe that Arab countries will pursue it when we have a strong president who will protect the integrity of our country, the commitment of our Constitution and Bill of Rights and protect people in this country who happen to be Jews.	0
ClaimBuster	13843				You don't guarantee they get the job.	0
ClaimBuster	13844				I didn't hear any comment from Governor Reagan about what he would do to stop or reduce terrorism in the future.	1
ClaimBuster	13845				I just have to say something.	0
ClaimBuster	13846				I was an altar boy.	1
ClaimBuster	13847				And I think we know what they are: a good strong future, a future in which there is opportunity for all of our citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	13848				Now, you've got to have a government that comes from you again.	0
ClaimBuster	13849				I say on balance it does more good than harm if, if we can get some protection for the environment so that the Mexicans have to follow their own environmental standards, their own labor law standards, and if we have a genuine commitment to reeducate and retrain the American workers who lose their jobs and reinvest in this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	13850				And he used to tell me things that I knew were not quite accurate.	0
ClaimBuster	13851				He was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of Baghdad, Matthew Stanley, before Christmas last year.	1
ClaimBuster	13852				The military will be an all-volunteer army.	0
ClaimBuster	13853				My plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	13854				We do need tougher sanctions.	0
ClaimBuster	13855				We ought to pursue strategies with each of them, economic and the rest, that help them pull away from their dependence upon the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	13856				They started from that little area, and now they're in 32 different nations, Hillary.	1
ClaimBuster	13857				Well, first of all, I gave him the benefit of the doubt on the house deal.	0
ClaimBuster	13858				I don't have a free reserved parking place at Natl Airport, why should my servants?	1
ClaimBuster	13859				The Oregon plan made some good sense, but it's easy to dismiss the concerns of the disabled.	0
ClaimBuster	13860				My problem with Governor Clinton, once again, is that one time he's gonna make up his mind, he sees some merit in it, but then he sees a lot of things wrong with it.	0
ClaimBuster	13861				Have a 3rd task force on new industries of the future to make sure we nail those for our country and they don't wind up in Europe and Asia.	0
ClaimBuster	13862				... by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it.	0
ClaimBuster	13863				More and more women are being elected.	1
ClaimBuster	13864				I think Government has a responsibility to find jobs for the youth of this country, and that the place to start is to assist in the very important and necessary task of helping cities rebuild.	0
ClaimBuster	13865				This is a deviation from idealism; it's a deviation from a commitment to our major ally in the Middle East, which is Israel; it's a yielding to economic pressure on the part of the Arabs on the oil issue; and it's also a tremendous indication that under the Ford administration we have not addressed the energy policy adequately.	0
ClaimBuster	13866				Nobody is going to follow somebody who doesn't believe we can succeed and with somebody who says that war where we are is a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	13867				So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	13868				And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals.	1
ClaimBuster	13869				And finally, we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded.	0
ClaimBuster	13870				There is much to be done.	0
ClaimBuster	13871				And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.	0
ClaimBuster	13872				I think Kenne- Senator Kennedy is wrong on three counts.	0
ClaimBuster	13873				And I think immediately following the Republican Convention, there was about a ten-point spread.	1
ClaimBuster	13874				No, no, I had a question and the question was how much did you cut them by?	0
ClaimBuster	13875				I've traveled the last twenty-one months among the people of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	13876				I appreciate that very much.	0
ClaimBuster	13877				It doesn't accommodate the expenditures that he calls for, for accelerated development and deployment of a new manned strategic bomber, for a permanent fleet in the Indian Ocean, for the restoration of the fleet to 600 ships, to the development and deployment of a dedicated modern aircraft interceptor.	1
ClaimBuster	13878				Uh - a job, a home for all those that'll work and save for it, uh - safety in the streets, uh - health that is a - health care that is affordable.	0
ClaimBuster	13879				Since I've got about 20 seconds, let me just say one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	13880				We hear all the negatives.	0
ClaimBuster	13881				They went -- they quadrupled their nuclear capacity.	1
ClaimBuster	13882				What it says is that gays and lesbians can't be fired from their job because they're gay or lesbian.	1
ClaimBuster	13883				That's why I believe there are going to be millions of Democrats that are going to vote with us this time around, because they too want that promise kept.	0
ClaimBuster	13884				We ought to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.	0
ClaimBuster	13885				And thanks to this great general, David Petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they have succeeded.	0
ClaimBuster	13886				There's even an Apple store in China that's a counterfeit Apple store, selling counterfeit goods.	1
ClaimBuster	13887				I spent my life in the private sector, not in government.	1
ClaimBuster	13888				And when I'm president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely.	0
ClaimBuster	13889				And it's not just about women.	0
ClaimBuster	13890				I think we have a real obligation, obviously public officials.	0
ClaimBuster	13891				There are hundreds of thousands of them.	1
ClaimBuster	13892				What about the prices you pay?	0
ClaimBuster	13893				Once it's a drug, does it apply only to teenagers or everybody in America?	0
ClaimBuster	13894				I think that we do.	0
ClaimBuster	13895				Now, I'm concerned that the path that we're on has just been unsuccessful.	0
ClaimBuster	13896				I would have to see what they wanted to do, but I don't believe that will be the request.	0
ClaimBuster	13897				We've got to fix our energy policy that's giving our wealth away.	0
ClaimBuster	13898				We had 25 fighter wings.	1
ClaimBuster	13899				What I've called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	13900				It's the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	13901				And we're all proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	13902				Both of these, I think, would respond to the proper kind of incentives that we could offer these people.	0
ClaimBuster	13903				We're going to do it by taking full advantage of oil, coal, gas, nuclear and our renewables.	0
ClaimBuster	13904				I will never stand for a reduction of the Social Security benefits to the people that are now getting them.	0
ClaimBuster	13905				Osama bin Laden attacked us.	1
ClaimBuster	13906				If you think that was good, then you do.	0
ClaimBuster	13907				He just said he wants everybody to be able to buy in to the same plan that senators and congressmen get.	0
ClaimBuster	13908				I know that we can grow manufacturing jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	13909				And my opponent has got a plan of retreat and defeat in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	13910				And all that raises revenue.	1
ClaimBuster	13911				Let me step back and talk about what I think our mission has to be in the Middle East and even more broadly, because our purpose is to make sure the world is more -- is peaceful.	0
ClaimBuster	13912				And he is leaving office with a popularity at an all-time high, because American people	1
ClaimBuster	13913				I have no intention of wilting.	0
ClaimBuster	13914				They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years.	0
ClaimBuster	13915				So, I vetoed it because of a loss of jobs and because it would've interfered with our energy independence program.	1
ClaimBuster	13916				They're suffering in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	13917				They're tomorrow's industries in the inner cities.	0
ClaimBuster	13918				And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way.	0
ClaimBuster	13919				I'm asking for your vote.	0
ClaimBuster	13920				It's time for a fresh start after a season of cynicism.	0
ClaimBuster	13921				The administration deserves credit for having made it work.	0
ClaimBuster	13922				The next thing is to try to get more entrepreneurship in business within the reach of minorities so that these businesses are located in the communities in which they're found.	0
ClaimBuster	13923				He testified, and these are his words - the present governor of Georgia - he says he found the Medicaid program in Georgia in shambles.	1
ClaimBuster	13924				I shouldn't have a preference.	0
ClaimBuster	13925				That's not what I think.	0
ClaimBuster	13926				But as Admiral Yarnell has said, and he's been supported by most military authority, these islands that we're now talking about are not worth the bones of a single American soldier; and I know how difficult it is to sustain troops close to the shore under artillery bombardment.	1
ClaimBuster	13927				But -- OK. All right.	0
ClaimBuster	13928				I'm shocked to hear that.	0
ClaimBuster	13929				And part of what we need to do, what the next president has to do -- and this is part of our judgment, this is part of how we're going to keep America safe -- is to -- to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education, we are going to invest in issues that -- that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams.	0
ClaimBuster	13930				And what the president said about the tax cuts has been wiped out by the increase in health care, the increase in gasoline, the increase in tuitions, the increase in prescription drugs.	1
ClaimBuster	13931				I think it is respecting life to reach for that cure.	0
ClaimBuster	13932				But unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it.	0
ClaimBuster	13933				Why not try to help them with my small business program to build some incentives into the system?	0
ClaimBuster	13934				I think we ought to raise the age at which juveniles can have a gun.	0
ClaimBuster	13935				Bob, Mr. President, folks at Lynn University, good to be with you.	0
ClaimBuster	13936				He was hoping we'd turn away.	0
ClaimBuster	13937				I started doing these formats a year ago in New Hampshire and I found that we had huge crowds because all I did was let people ask questions and I tried to give very specific answers.	1
ClaimBuster	13938				Because you know, in the first debate, Mr. Bush made some news.	1
ClaimBuster	13939				There are inspections that are very intrusive.	0
ClaimBuster	13940				Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders.	1
ClaimBuster	13941				He voted for nearly a billion dollars in pork barrel earmark projects, including, by the way, $3 million for an overhead projector at a planetarium in Chicago, Illinois.	1
ClaimBuster	13942				There are certainly dangers there, there are certainly other trouble spots in the world which are closer to Europe than to the US.	0
ClaimBuster	13943				For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.	1
ClaimBuster	13944				It will be good for our economy and it will be good for job creation.	0
ClaimBuster	13945				The bottom line of national strength is that the President must be in command, he must lead.	0
ClaimBuster	13946				And I think tonight, as we contrast for the first time our differing approach to government, to values, to the leadership in this country, I think as this debate goes forward, the American people will have for the first time a chance to weigh the two of us against each other.	0
ClaimBuster	13947				And what was the cost?	0
ClaimBuster	13948				You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia.	0
ClaimBuster	13949				I don't intend to see to it that the United States is ever in a position where, while we're negotiating with the Soviet Union, that we discontinue our intelligence effort.	0
ClaimBuster	13950				He believes in nation building.	0
ClaimBuster	13951				The killing and tragedies had taken place.	1
ClaimBuster	13952				It's not an accurate one at all.	0
ClaimBuster	13953				We don't have to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	13954				I'm not proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	13955				Look, I'll sit down with anybody, but there's got to be pre-conditions.	0
ClaimBuster	13956				We want to work with the Russians.	0
ClaimBuster	13957				If you have -- if you squander the surplus on a huge tax cut that goes mostly to those at the top, then you can't make education the top priority.	0
ClaimBuster	13958				When I ran for president, I said we'd cut the deficit in half in four years; we cut it by 60 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	13959				Whether it be on fighting the pharmaceutical companies on Medicare prescription drugs, importation.	0
ClaimBuster	13960				We got to start moving them toward full citizenship, out of the shadows.	0
ClaimBuster	13961				One thing about insurance, that's a Washington term.	0
ClaimBuster	13962				Every time Mr. Ford speaks from a position of secrecy in negotiations, in secret - in secret treaties that've been uh - pursued and achieved, in supporting dictatorships, in ignoring human rights, we are weak and the rest of the world knows it.	0
ClaimBuster	13963				It's not going to happen overnight; it certainly will have to happen on a step-by-step basis as we make progress in arms negotiation and arms control and arms reduction.	0
ClaimBuster	13964				You know, because it sounds like you're in the business or you're aware of people in the business -- you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent.	1
ClaimBuster	13965				I've got three part- time jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	13966				I'm not talking about leaving.	0
ClaimBuster	13967				So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues.	0
ClaimBuster	13968				Start asking the question, what do you know?	0
ClaimBuster	13969				I would not be able wou- would be willing to meet with him however, unless there were preparations for that conference which would give us some reasonable certainty - some reasonable certainty - that you were going to have some success.	0
ClaimBuster	13970				We're not going to be able to be everywhere all the time.	0
ClaimBuster	13971				It is actually a disagreement between us, a national law that is pending on this, the Dingle-Norwood bill, a bipartisan bill, is one that I support and that the governor does not.	1
ClaimBuster	13972				The president's characterization of my tax plan...	0
ClaimBuster	13973				And I think it -- you know, it's a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	13974				I said many foolish things back in those days.	0
ClaimBuster	13975				Let me say in my case, if I'm out of work, I'll cut grass tomorrow to take care of my family; I'll be happy to make shoes, I'll be happy to make clothing, I'll make sausage.	0
ClaimBuster	13976				As a matter of fact, that committee under Secretary Hills released about a seventy-five-page report with specific recommendations so we can do a better job uh - the weeks ahead.	1
ClaimBuster	13977				I don't believe that our relative strength is increasing.	0
ClaimBuster	13978				Uh - I think Senator Dole would show more good judgment and discretion than to so describe uh - a heroic and brave and very outstanding leader of the military.	0
ClaimBuster	13979				Under Vice President Gore's plan, they get $145 of tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	13980				Go back to work at 30,000 bucks a month representing some other country.	0
ClaimBuster	13981				I don't believe that Mr. Mondale has a plan for balancing the budget; he has a plan for raising taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	13982				And I introduced the first legislation, and we forced votes on it.	1
ClaimBuster	13983				Now, we're sitting down and talking to the Soviets about strategic arms, and he wants to do away with the Midgetman and the MX, the modernization or our nuclear capability.	0
ClaimBuster	13984				And it is absolutely critical that we understand this is not just a challenge, it's an opportunity, because if we create a new energy economy, we can create five million new jobs, easily, here in the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	13985				The issue of abortion is a very difficult issue, one that I think that we all have to wrestle with, we have to come to terms with.	0
ClaimBuster	13986				In fact, he went on to say... WALLACE: Her two minutes -- sir, her two minutes.	0
ClaimBuster	13987				And I'm looking forward to having that debate.	0
ClaimBuster	13988				And I will not cut our military budget by a trillion dollars, which is a combination of the budget cuts the president has, as well as the sequestration cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	13989				Well, the red light went on.	0
ClaimBuster	13990				I will fight to create more energy in this country, to get America energy secure.	0
ClaimBuster	13991				Mr. Bush is trying to run against Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter and everybody in the world but me in this race.	0
ClaimBuster	13992				Let me point out again that his Congress - the Democratic Congress - has cut eighty million dollars off of the Voice of America appropriations.	1
ClaimBuster	13993				Unless there was a severe recession - and after all the worst unbalanced budget in history was in 1958, twelve billion dollars - larger than in any Administration in the history of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	13994				I think what the FBI did and what the Department of Justice did, including meeting with her husband, the attorney general, in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in Arizona, I think it's disgraceful.	1
ClaimBuster	13995				We can compete with anyone in the world as long as the playing field is level.	0
ClaimBuster	13996				And instead of retreating -- instead of being strong where we should be strong, he wants to make it strong and intervene in the most private and personal questions in American life.	0
ClaimBuster	13997				There are three fundamental challenges.	0
ClaimBuster	13998				And finally, we ought to be promoting the democratic impulses around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	13999				If the objective body rules on your behalf, the insurance company must follow those rules.	0
ClaimBuster	14000				The record in handling them has been very good during this Administration.	0
ClaimBuster	14001				I have been in the cabinet.	1
ClaimBuster	14002				I've never wilted in my life.	1
ClaimBuster	14003				But we're not there yet.	0
ClaimBuster	14004				We had a difference on the timetable.	1
ClaimBuster	14005				I strongly believe that one of the best things to encourage parental involvement also is to know that the classrooms will be safe and secure.	0
ClaimBuster	14006				I've gotten a lot of good experience in dealing with ordinary people over the last year and month.	0
ClaimBuster	14007				But I hope you won't take my five seconds away from me.	0
ClaimBuster	14008				They sacrifice, they give everything for America.	0
ClaimBuster	14009				Already many people see the strange weather conditions that the old timers say they've never seen before in their lifetimes.	1
ClaimBuster	14010				That's the plan for victory.	0
ClaimBuster	14011				It can't get any worse.	0
ClaimBuster	14012				We now are planning to continue the revitalization program with increased commitments of rapid transit, mass transit.	0
ClaimBuster	14013				In the same way that we should enforce rules against China manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper.	0
ClaimBuster	14014				All of our children have gone to both public schools and private schools.	1
ClaimBuster	14015				I know that's a controversial view, but I do believe it's a deterrent.	0
ClaimBuster	14016				I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me.	1
ClaimBuster	14017				We can give you all these numbers, they don't mean a thing.	0
ClaimBuster	14018				And I want to call a hemispheric summit just as soon after the 20th of January as possible to fight that war.	0
ClaimBuster	14019				I don't care what it is -- competitiveness, health care, crime, you name it.	0
ClaimBuster	14020				I hear from teachers all the time about the lawsuits and the threats, respect in the classroom.	0
ClaimBuster	14021				But it didn't stop him from endorsing the sale of arms to the Ayatollah.	0
ClaimBuster	14022				I want to rebuild our military to keep the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	14023				You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail.	0
ClaimBuster	14024				We should come to its defense.	0
ClaimBuster	14025				60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers have been denied handguns.	1
ClaimBuster	14026				I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America.	0
ClaimBuster	14027				This is typical of his long-standing inclination, on the use of American power, not to resolve disputes diplomatically and peacefully, but to show that the exercise of military power is best proven by the actual use of it.	0
ClaimBuster	14028				I believe they want to.	0
ClaimBuster	14029				Proud that they voted for the right candidate.	0
ClaimBuster	14030				We've had a 25% reduction since the first year I was in office.	1
ClaimBuster	14031				This is a time when bin Laden was still out, and now they've reconstituted themselves.	1
ClaimBuster	14032				The Secretary of Defense himself said it would be a suicide mission if it were built.	1
ClaimBuster	14033				Isn't the real question is will we be better off?	0
ClaimBuster	14034				We're giving them lots of money, lots of everything.	1
ClaimBuster	14035				And we're retaining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow.	1
ClaimBuster	14036				We could have done that in Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	14037				I believe that younger workers ought to be allowed to take some of their own money and put it in a personal savings account, because I understand that they need to get better rates of return than the rates of return being given in the current Social Security trust.	0
ClaimBuster	14038				Well, let's look at the president's policies, all right, as opposed to the rhetoric, because we've had four years of policies being played out.	0
ClaimBuster	14039				And Jack Kemp and I want to share with you some ideas tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	14040				I have a plan to provide health care to all Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	14041				Now, the other day, Mr. Bush said, √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬∞√Ç¬•Well, if we continue with Star War-Star Wars-we have to cut some place.√É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬∞√Ç¬§ He hasn't told us where.	1
ClaimBuster	14042				We have to bring back our workers.	0
ClaimBuster	14043				And let me say again, Detroit is rearing to go on that.	0
ClaimBuster	14044				We're providing that young woman with help.	0
ClaimBuster	14045				If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there's nothing in my opinion that America can't do.	0
ClaimBuster	14046				In the hands of a terrorist enemy.	0
ClaimBuster	14047				I think this is a great example.	0
ClaimBuster	14048				Senator Bentsen and I have a plan for the 1990√É¬è√¢‚Äö¬¨s and beyond.	0
ClaimBuster	14049				But I know this, we have serious financial problems in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	14050				We're going to tell you how to do it all.	0
ClaimBuster	14051				I accept his objective and his dream; we all do.	0
ClaimBuster	14052				Do you know we don't have a single program sponsored by our government to Cuba - to tell them our story, to tell them that we are their friends, that we want them to be free again?	1
ClaimBuster	14053				I will balance the budget every year.	0
ClaimBuster	14054				There will be people with experience and people who understand America and people who've made it and know the hard knocks in life.	0
ClaimBuster	14055				It's why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had -- had the plan.	1
ClaimBuster	14056				Well, the people need it, that's the point.	0
ClaimBuster	14057				The one thing I'm for is a safe society.	0
ClaimBuster	14058				They don't want us talking about each other.	0
ClaimBuster	14059				Do we really want those decisions made by judges who've been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty?	0
ClaimBuster	14060				And what I'm concerned about is that if we continue with the policies that Mr. Bush is talking about here this evening, the flexible freeze somebody described it the other day as a kind of economic slurpee he wants to spend billions on virtually every weapons system around.	0
ClaimBuster	14061				That's no way to treat somebody who's courageous and brave, that is trying to lead his country forward.	0
ClaimBuster	14062				The Surgeon General is doing a good job in encouraging the proper kind of education.	0
ClaimBuster	14063				But the exciting thing is, the fear of nuclear war is down.	0
ClaimBuster	14064				And so I think it's about time we get this Noriega matter in perspective.	0
ClaimBuster	14065				I want to see rural redevelopment and I have been out front in favor of alternate sources of energy and one of them is gasohol and comes from using your corn and I think we can do better in terms of biodegradable for a lot of product, so I'm optimistic about the agricultural economy.	0
ClaimBuster	14066				You know, back after World War II when we had hundreds of thousands of GIs who came back from the war, we didn't sit around.	1
ClaimBuster	14067				That's the analysis of economists who have looked at this.	1
ClaimBuster	14068				Two-thirds of our jobs come from small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	14069				It means our goods aren't as competitive and we lose jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	14070				With decent and affordable housing that our people can buy and own and live in, so that we end the shame of hopelessness in America.	0
ClaimBuster	14071				I know it made a lot of difference many times in the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	14072				I believe in the transformational power of liberty.	0
ClaimBuster	14073				If affirmative action means quotas, I'm against it.	0
ClaimBuster	14074				I have a winning temperament.	0
ClaimBuster	14075				That means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who re-enlisted in Baghdad, just like the mother I met at the airport the other day whose son was killed.	1
ClaimBuster	14076				The resolution commits the president in the United States, which I supported, to defend uh - Formosa, the Pescadores, and if it was his military judgment, these islands.	1
ClaimBuster	14077				And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car.	0
ClaimBuster	14078				But let me start with what you said.	0
ClaimBuster	14079				... the long-term health care drivers.	0
ClaimBuster	14080				So these are three programs which are quite moderate.	0
ClaimBuster	14081				It was President Bush that wrote the first checks.	1
ClaimBuster	14082				So I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	14083				You don't say that out loud.	0
ClaimBuster	14084				And the greatest resource of all are the two hundred and fifteen million Americans who have within us the strength, the character, the intelligence, the experience, the patriotism, the idealism, the compassion, the sense of brotherhood on which we can rely in the future to restore the greatness to our country We ought not to be excluded from our government anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	14085				That is a very serious charge against the president.	0
ClaimBuster	14086				Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they're taking our wealth.	1
ClaimBuster	14087				And so I just feel this is where I'm coming from.	0
ClaimBuster	14088				But again, the test or the difference between us, the president has had four years to try to do something about it, and North Korea has got more weapons; Iran is moving towards weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	14089				And when and if -- and it's not going to happen, because you have Russia and you have Iran now.	0
ClaimBuster	14090				And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job.	0
ClaimBuster	14091				We're going to tax -- cut taxes and balance the budget.	0
ClaimBuster	14092				The other night Governor Clinton raised my -- I don't know if you saw the debate the other night.	0
ClaimBuster	14093				He talks about all the jobs he's created in one or 2 years.	1
ClaimBuster	14094				Well, no, but the point is that's a subjective thing.	0
ClaimBuster	14095				And this was the spot at which President Carter had promised that he was going to bring in a vast program to rebuild this department.	1
ClaimBuster	14096				So she wants to fight.	0
ClaimBuster	14097				Canada's tax rate on companies is now 15 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	14098				Maybe you don't go out to dinner as much.	0
ClaimBuster	14099				And the last president of the United States that tried that was Herbert Hoover, and we went from a deep recession into a depression.	1
ClaimBuster	14100				And when we do things like that -- when we bring those who have harmed us to justice, that sends a message to the world and it tells Peyton (ph) that we did not forget her father.	0
ClaimBuster	14101				Is that the way it works?	0
ClaimBuster	14102				I think you have to tell the pharmaceutical companies they can't keep raising drug prices at three times the rate of inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	14103				He -- he aligned with Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	14104				Number one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition.	1
ClaimBuster	14105				It is new and it is very very different than what's happened, but it's not quite ready to be totally implemented.	0
ClaimBuster	14106				Government always needs the money it gets.	0
ClaimBuster	14107				And I think it's very important to the United States, obviously, to have a working relationship that is good.	0
ClaimBuster	14108				But you've been -- but you've been president four years...	1
ClaimBuster	14109				Is it true that, as far as this country is concerned, in the field of electric power, in all of the fields that he has mentioned, we have not been moving ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	14110				I think of those young athletes who represented us at the Olympics were tremendously impressive.	0
ClaimBuster	14111				Now, the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	14112				That's an example of an unfair burden sharing.	0
ClaimBuster	14113				On a per-person basis, it did cut way below the rate of inflation in medical costs.	1
ClaimBuster	14114				My judgment is that the Republican party has stood still here in the United States, and it's also stood still around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	14115				So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.	0
ClaimBuster	14116				Now, I think we ought to try to help families and see if it will do what I think -- make all schools better.	0
ClaimBuster	14117				Senator Obama suspended those requests for pork-barrel projects after he was running for president of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	14118				My judgment is that the program the Vice President put forward, which is an extension of Mr. Benson's program, will cost a billion dollars more than the present program, which costs about six billion dollars a year, the most expensive in history.	1
ClaimBuster	14119				Would we be better off as I believe, working together to give each other the tools we need to make the most of our God-given potential, or are we better off saying, you're on your own?	0
ClaimBuster	14120				I got him to give the birth certificate.	1
ClaimBuster	14121				Well, I think it starts with Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	14122				And if we lose our will, we lose.	0
ClaimBuster	14123				We're on a different system.	1
ClaimBuster	14124				We will not have open borders.	0
ClaimBuster	14125				And I am going to continue to defend my record and defend my propositions against what I think are exaggerations.	0
ClaimBuster	14126				Four years ago I ran for president at a time of high unemployment and rising frustration.	1
ClaimBuster	14127				We want to be stronger.	0
ClaimBuster	14128				I gave, in September of 1974, an opportunity for all draft evaders, all deserters, to come in voluntarily, clear their records by earning an opportunity to restore their good citizenship.	1
ClaimBuster	14129				I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America.	0
ClaimBuster	14130				And today, on the average, the average serviceman is at least 15% - and I happen to think that's a very modest estimate - 15% below what has happened to the cost of living over that period of time.	1
ClaimBuster	14131				We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	14132				I don't see how you can win in Iraq if you don't believe we should be there in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	14133				He didn't tell you that he vetoed a middle class tax cut because it would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy and vetoed an investment tax credit paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy.	1
ClaimBuster	14134				I've been in politics a long time, and I don't remember that kind of piling on, that kind of ugly rumor that never was true, printed.	0
ClaimBuster	14135				And we also have important domestic priorities, in education and housing and health care, in economic development, in job training, in the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	14136				I'll stand on my record on that.	0
ClaimBuster	14137				I'm also going to dramatically expand trade in Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	14138				This weakens the chances of civilization to survive.	0
ClaimBuster	14139				We need a president who stays deadly focused on the real war on terror.	0
ClaimBuster	14140				I don't believe in Constitutional Amendments that would interfere with that.	0
ClaimBuster	14141				The Philippines -- we've got help -- we're helping them there to bring -- to bring Al Qaida affiliates to justice there.	1
ClaimBuster	14142				And so we have a fundamental difference on this one.	0
ClaimBuster	14143				The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	14144				... 17 intelligence -- do you doubt 17 military and civilian...	0
ClaimBuster	14145				And you do have experience.	0
ClaimBuster	14146				It's a strategy that will succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	14147				And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again.	1
ClaimBuster	14148				The amnesty program that I recommended in Chicago in September of 1974 would give to all draft evaders and - uh military deserters the opportunity to earn their uh - good record back.	1
ClaimBuster	14149				And I just described -- I just described to you, Mr. President -- I just described to you precisely how I'd do it which is with a single number that people can put -- and they can put they're -- they're deductions and credits...	0
ClaimBuster	14150				And incidentally, Mel Carnahan in Missouri had the finest record on diversity in any governor in the entire history of the State of Missouri.	1
ClaimBuster	14151				Thank you, and good night.	0
ClaimBuster	14152				And to make sure our society is as hopeful as it possibly can be, every single child in America must be educated.	0
ClaimBuster	14153				On the question of the cost of our budget, I have stated that it's my best judgment that our agricultural program will cost a billion and a half, possibly two billion dollars less than the present agricultural program.	1
ClaimBuster	14154				That, I think, is a mistake and I think that this is a fundamental difference in our campaign and how we would approach health care.	0
ClaimBuster	14155				Some sophisticates think it may be a little gimmicky.	0
ClaimBuster	14156				I strongly support new accountability, so does Governor Bush.	0
ClaimBuster	14157				Roughly a hundred billion to a hundred and a quarter billion of that is the result of government activity.	1
ClaimBuster	14158				It's an election about the course of America.	0
ClaimBuster	14159				But as occurred at the end of the con- Democratic Convention, the Republican Party unified itself.	1
ClaimBuster	14160				He should have produced it a long time before.	0
ClaimBuster	14161				In 20 days, you will help decide who will lead this country into the next century.	1
ClaimBuster	14162				There has been too much government secrecy and not uh - not enough respect for the personal privacy of American citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	14163				Well, Sander, that's a good question, and the answer is: for 40-some years we kept the peace.	1
ClaimBuster	14164				Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago?	0
ClaimBuster	14165				And it's widely reported that drones are being used in drone strikes, and I support that and entirely, and feel the president was right to up the usage of that technology, and believe that we should continue to use it, to continue to go after the people that represent a threat to this nation and to our friends.	1
ClaimBuster	14166				We'll do everything we can to improve adoption in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	14167				They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.	0
ClaimBuster	14168				But I respect the presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	14169				My intentions are to earn your vote and earn your confidence.	0
ClaimBuster	14170				That, in my view, is making -- is making our future less certain and less secure.	0
ClaimBuster	14171				And furthermore, under this administration, spending has increased more than it has in the last 20 years and he asked Congress to spend more money than it actually spent.	1
ClaimBuster	14172				I don't think they ought to be held guilty.	0
ClaimBuster	14173				Highest private home ownership ever, but I'll make you one promise here.	1
ClaimBuster	14174				It's mortgaging our children's future.	0
ClaimBuster	14175				"Do you have what it takes?"""	0
ClaimBuster	14176				Well, wait, but it's very important.	0
ClaimBuster	14177				Mr. Bush, I don't question your patriotism.	0
ClaimBuster	14178				To do that, a President must know what is essential to command and to leadership and to strength.	0
ClaimBuster	14179				Mr. Mondale, I'm going to hang in there.	0
ClaimBuster	14180				I'm sorry, Jim, I'm going to stop the subsidy to PBS.	0
ClaimBuster	14181				Will the Congo go Communist?	0
ClaimBuster	14182				I am for equal rights, and while you have been in office for four ears and not one single state - and most f them have a majority of Democratic legislators - has added to the ratification r voted to ratify the equal rights amendment.	1
ClaimBuster	14183				We're going to go right back to what we had under Mr. Truman when he had political control of the Federal Reserve Board.	1
ClaimBuster	14184				But we can make a difference in terms ensuring that every young person in America, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, have a chance to succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	14185				We've had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	14186				Because when there are elections, people tend to vote for peace.	0
ClaimBuster	14187				No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too.	1
ClaimBuster	14188				We have gone from a triple-dip recession during the previous 12 years to a tripling of the stock market.	1
ClaimBuster	14189				And it seems to me with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers, and with more money in the hands of business to expand, to modernize, to provide more jobs, our economy stimulated so that we'll get more revenue and we'll have a more prosperous economy.	0
ClaimBuster	14190				Well, again, while you were on the board of the Woods Foundation, you and Mr. Ayers, together, you sent $230,000 to ACORN.	1
ClaimBuster	14191				$716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we weren't overpaying providers.	1
ClaimBuster	14192				I've been President now for almost four years.	1
ClaimBuster	14193				Maybe I'm missing something here.	0
ClaimBuster	14194				The Natl Women's Political Caucus gave me an award, one of their Good Guy Awards, for my involvement of women in high levels of government, and I've appointed more minorities to positions of high level in government than all the governors in the history of my state combined, before me.	1
ClaimBuster	14195				Not -- well, we turned over 35,000, so...	1
ClaimBuster	14196				And we are winning in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	14197				We knew he hated us.	0
ClaimBuster	14198				But let me just say the American Hospital Association said that the budget I vetoed could have closed 700 hospitals.	1
ClaimBuster	14199				And I did stop them, I admit that.	1
ClaimBuster	14200				I think Congress is hungry for someone who will work with them instead of manipulate them.	0
ClaimBuster	14201				And so, the terrorist acts began and led to the one great tragedy when they were killed in that suicide bombing of the building.	1
ClaimBuster	14202				During the 1990s, we had pay-as-you-go rules.	1
ClaimBuster	14203				We might have had some differences, and we had a lot of debates...	1
ClaimBuster	14204				We remember what it was like when we had a spending president and a spending Congress, and interest rates -- who remembers that?	0
ClaimBuster	14205				He says he's not going to raise taxes, though he has broken that pledge repeatedly.	1
ClaimBuster	14206				I think we ought to get at it.	0
ClaimBuster	14207				How do we protect our people?	0
ClaimBuster	14208				You know, she's given it to us.	0
ClaimBuster	14209				Most Americans believe in basic values.	0
ClaimBuster	14210				The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall.	1
ClaimBuster	14211				I think it's been a very constructive debate and I hope it's helped to acquaint the American people with the sharp differences between myself and Governor Reagan.	0
ClaimBuster	14212				That wouldn't have stopped if we hadn't been willing wouldn't have even started, the Soviets coming out, if we hadn't even been willing to support the freedom fighters there.	0
ClaimBuster	14213				I think it's worth it, because I think -- I know in the long term a free Iraq, a free Afghanistan, will set such a powerful example in a part of the world that's desperate for freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	14214				I doubt very much that Dan Quayle was the best qualified person for that job.	0
ClaimBuster	14215				But everybody's affected by the debt because of the tremendous interest that goes into paying on that debt everything's more expensive.	0
ClaimBuster	14216				And we believe China can be a partner, but we're also sending a very clear signal that America is a Pacific power; that we are going to have a presence there.	0
ClaimBuster	14217				This was the president's plan.	1
ClaimBuster	14218				And that same strategy will be employed in Afghanistan by this great general.	0
ClaimBuster	14219				Somebody, you know, maybe your son, maybe your grandson, maybe somebody else.	0
ClaimBuster	14220				We love you, and we're grateful to you for everything that you've given to us.	0
ClaimBuster	14221				It's a lonely job, but with the involvement of the American people in the process, with an open Government, the job is a very gratifying one.	0
ClaimBuster	14222				This commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our nation in the future, because with the windfall profits tax as a base, we now have an opportunity to use American technology and American ability and American natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels, yes; to expand rapidly the production of solar energy, yes; and also to produce the traditional kinds of American energy.	0
ClaimBuster	14223				Every parent out there has much less worry that their kids are going to be faced with nuclear holocaust.	0
ClaimBuster	14224				And that they are bad, and we ought to do something about them, and we ought to support housing legislation which this Administration has opposed.	0
ClaimBuster	14225				There needs to be more community health clinics where the poor can go get health care.	0
ClaimBuster	14226				Number two, change the tax code.	0
ClaimBuster	14227				As to Ferdinand Marcos, he isn't there any more.	1
ClaimBuster	14228				When we've worked hard to end the Northern Korean nuclear threat.	0
ClaimBuster	14229				The second point I want to make is -- is the issue of energy.	0
ClaimBuster	14230				Why do I take it now?	0
ClaimBuster	14231				The negotiations far the Panama Canal started under President Johnson and have continued up to the present time.	1
ClaimBuster	14232				Governor Romney then also wants to spend $2 trillion on additional military programs even though the military's not asking for them.	1
ClaimBuster	14233				Well, what he is saying there in effect, we're going to have inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	14234				I just happen to believe strongly that marriage is between a man and a woman.	0
ClaimBuster	14235				And that we do those things that make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, innovators, businesses to grow.	0
ClaimBuster	14236				But that's the way I, George Bush, feel about it.	0
ClaimBuster	14237				I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing.	0
ClaimBuster	14238				I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training, because this world is more complex and we're being pressed harder all the time.	0
ClaimBuster	14239				It always works that way.	0
ClaimBuster	14240				In Africa, the United States has ignored Latin uh - Africa.	0
ClaimBuster	14241				I guess it's because you will lose your right to tell them what to think.	0
ClaimBuster	14242				And for the state to interfere in that decision, under whatever guise, and with whatever rationale, for the state to try to take over in that situation, and by edict, command what the individual shall do, and substitute itself for that individual's conscience, for her right to consult her rabbi, her minister, her priest, her doctor - any other counselor of her choice - I think goes beyond what we want to ever see accomplished in this country, if we really believe in the First Amendment: if we really believe in freedom of choice and the right of the individual.	0
ClaimBuster	14243				A free Iraq will be an ally in the war on terror, and that's essential.	0
ClaimBuster	14244				But the -- but here's the thing, is that, even if Senator McCain were to say that vouchers were the way to go -- I disagree with him on this, because the data doesn't show that it actually solves the problem -- the centerpiece of Senator McCain's education policy is to increase the voucher program in D.C. by 2,000 slots.	1
ClaimBuster	14245				I'm getting rid of the carried interest provision.	0
ClaimBuster	14246				He came here for a reason, to tout our record on health in Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	14247				After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.	1
ClaimBuster	14248				Your targeted tax cut, Mr. President, never hits anybody.	0
ClaimBuster	14249				He wants to give you sort of a government tax cut, which really doesn't mean anything.	0
ClaimBuster	14250				Well, I think what the vice president is saying is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this decision.	0
ClaimBuster	14251				And so I say that the record shows that we know how to keep the peace, to keep it without surrender.	0
ClaimBuster	14252				Even though it's true that, perhaps, between now and the end of the decade, our total consumption of oil may not increase by more than, perhaps, a million or 2 million barrels of oil a day.	1
ClaimBuster	14253				I don't believe legalizing narcotics is the answer.	0
ClaimBuster	14254				We shouldn't be lending money to corrupt officials.	0
ClaimBuster	14255				One other point I would make: what could you do?	0
ClaimBuster	14256				But I can assure you that if I'm elected president, the whole spectrum of taxes will be gone through carefully.	0
ClaimBuster	14257				I was given the briefing and told that any time, night or day, I might be called upon to make the most fateful decision on Earth -- whether to fire these atomic weapons that could destroy the human species.	1
ClaimBuster	14258				I also will not add a penny to the debt.	0
ClaimBuster	14259				I believe we should increase our strength all over the world.	0
ClaimBuster	14260				Makes you feel real good to hear that, right?	0
ClaimBuster	14261				And since we did that, in the areas where we concluded, trade agreements or exports to Japan have gone up by 85 percent in the last four years and our trade deficit with Japan has gone down.	1
ClaimBuster	14262				My fellow Americans, as I've said at the very beginning of this debate, both President Bush and I love this country very much.	1
ClaimBuster	14263				These are not just women's issues.	0
ClaimBuster	14264				I was in the Lomax AME Church.	1
ClaimBuster	14265				You've said the same thing, you're going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base.	1
ClaimBuster	14266				Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.	1
ClaimBuster	14267				Also, the new energy policy has been predicated on two factors: One is conservation, which requires sacrifice, and the other one, increase in production of American energy, which is going along very well - more coal this year than ever before in American history, more oil and gas wells drilled this year than ever before in history.	1
ClaimBuster	14268				Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	14269				I - I accomplished this with s - substantial reductions in employees in some departments.	1
ClaimBuster	14270				And we are not well served when we attack each other in a kind of ad hominem way.	0
ClaimBuster	14271				We are -- right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash.	0
ClaimBuster	14272				And my plan has a better chance of standing up and fighting for those troops.	0
ClaimBuster	14273				And throughout all that time the people I have fought for have been the middle-class families, and I have been willing to stand up to powerful interests like the big insurance companies, the drug companies, the HMOs, the oil companies.	1
ClaimBuster	14274				I think that's fundamental in our country, that you know what you're getting into.	0
ClaimBuster	14275				John, I'm sorry, but that's not true.	0
ClaimBuster	14276				Anyway, he co-sponsored McCain-Feingold, and yet he didn't.	1
ClaimBuster	14277				So what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country.	1
ClaimBuster	14278				I won't hold it against him that he went to Yale.	0
ClaimBuster	14279				I thought he made the right decision to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	14280				We have nuclear power, which, I believe, with the safest.	0
ClaimBuster	14281				The other day I was honored to be flanked by Colin Powell and General Norman Schwartzkopf recently stood by me side and agreed with me.	1
ClaimBuster	14282				And I think Ross Perot has done a good job in having them.	0
ClaimBuster	14283				I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	14284				I believe, number one, it would pose a real problem for a lot of smaller states in the Congress who have enough trouble now making sure their interests are heard.	0
ClaimBuster	14285				Now what is the issue is what we're going to do in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	14286				And at the same time will destroy markets that are important to our farmers.	0
ClaimBuster	14287				But what I've also says is for above $250,000, we can go back to the tax rates we had when Bill Clinton was president.	0
ClaimBuster	14288				Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS.	1
ClaimBuster	14289				It's been projected that they could conceivably bust the budget by $900 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	14290				Spending research and development money so that we can use our technological base to figure out new uses for farm products.	0
ClaimBuster	14291				We believe that that's too much additional money to take out of the pockets of the people.	0
ClaimBuster	14292				He just liked to make it sound exager, a little better, made him feel better.	0
ClaimBuster	14293				They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.	1
ClaimBuster	14294				We're working with Canada to hopefully -- that they'll produce a -- help us realize the vaccine necessary to make sure our citizens have got flu vaccinations during this upcoming season.	1
ClaimBuster	14295				When the businesses go bankrupt, I know them.	0
ClaimBuster	14296				I have costed out what I'm going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	14297				There are 30 countries there.	1
ClaimBuster	14298				She's been doing this for 30 years.	1
ClaimBuster	14299				And that's the way Eisenhower and Reagan and Kennedy and others did it.	1
ClaimBuster	14300				Like Mr. Perot, I have held crack babies in my arms.	1
ClaimBuster	14301				And it's time we had that bresh of freth air (sic) -- breath of fresh air coming into our nation's capital and sweep out the old-boy network and the cronyism that's been so much a part of it that I've fought against for all these years.	0
ClaimBuster	14302				Help us prioritize those who need to get the flu shot, the elderly and the young.	0
ClaimBuster	14303				He has no respect for our president.	0
ClaimBuster	14304				And I'm going to keep on vetoing them, because I don't think we're taxed too little.	0
ClaimBuster	14305				That is a bad policy.	0
ClaimBuster	14306				We just have a bad system.	0
ClaimBuster	14307				But we went from 2,200 to 500.	1
ClaimBuster	14308				So -- so let's state -- one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	14309				Well, I always have difficulty recognizing my positions when they're stated by the Vice President.	0
ClaimBuster	14310				And I've got a different vision for America.	0
ClaimBuster	14311				I can't let the man continue with fuzzy math.	0
ClaimBuster	14312				I'm going to hold that summit.	0
ClaimBuster	14313				It's a horrible thing she's doing.	0
ClaimBuster	14314				One by holding down the value of their currency.	0
ClaimBuster	14315				We have the lowest per capita state and local spending in the country.	1
ClaimBuster	14316				And I don't think the record justifies the conclusion that you come to.	0
ClaimBuster	14317				We have to do this job.	0
ClaimBuster	14318				But since they're bred from childhood to fight with one another rather than get results, you know, I would be glad to drop out and spend a little time and see if we couldn't build some bridges.	0
ClaimBuster	14319				So is it President Obama's fault?	0
ClaimBuster	14320				He has about uh - four times as much chance that he'll be out of work in his life as the white baby.	1
ClaimBuster	14321				And I was probably one of the first senators, along with Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, a former senator, to go down into the KGB underneath Treblinka Square and see reams of files with names in them.	1
ClaimBuster	14322				I don't have any PAC money in my campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	14323				Because China, Germany, they're making these investments.	1
ClaimBuster	14324				I think what Mr. Novins was referring to was not one of Senator Kennedy's speeches, but the Democratic platform, which did mention cutting the national debt.	0
ClaimBuster	14325				These weren't taken from abortion or something like that.	0
ClaimBuster	14326				Susan, I don't agree that there are no women and minorities in important positions in my campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	14327				I was one of only a few Democrats in the Senate to support the Persian Gulf War.	1
ClaimBuster	14328				Our party has been focused too long.	0
ClaimBuster	14329				There have been many wars in the history of mankind.	1
ClaimBuster	14330				Secrecy ought to be stripped away from government and a maximum of personal privacy ought to be maintained.	0
ClaimBuster	14331				One is make sure Congress doesn't overspend.	0
ClaimBuster	14332				And we can't expect that if we do the same things that we've been doing over the last eight years, that somehow we are going to have a different outcome.	0
ClaimBuster	14333				I think that he just said that freedom is a gift from the Almighty.	0
ClaimBuster	14334				My mind was full of what I was going to put in that letter about the problems and the issues that confront us in our time and what we did about them.	0
ClaimBuster	14335				And I believe if we have a good balanced approach, we can get the good banks loaning money again, end the credit crunch, have proper regulation on the ones that are in trouble, and not overreact.	0
ClaimBuster	14336				We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not.	0
ClaimBuster	14337				That's precisely what Vladimir Putin understands, as well.	0
ClaimBuster	14338				This doesn't have to be.	0
ClaimBuster	14339				Sometimes people who are very idealistic and have great dreams, as young people do, are apt to stay at arm's length from the political process because they think their good hearts might be brittle, and if they invest their hopes and allow themselves to believe, then they're gonna be let down and disappointed.	0
ClaimBuster	14340				Number two, make sure that they are standing by our interests in Israel's security, because it is a true friend and our greatest ally in the region.	0
ClaimBuster	14341				Yes, we now have catastrophic health insurance, but it's going to cost, and that's going to be an additional burden on elderly citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	14342				I believe that 25 million people, the vast majority, long to have elections.	0
ClaimBuster	14343				Well obviously we wouldn't use the Russians if they didn't agree with our answer, Mr. Vice President.	0
ClaimBuster	14344				And to the governor's credit, you supported us going into Libya and the coalition that we organized.	1
ClaimBuster	14345				And if there's anything more unwise than that, I don't know what it is.	0
ClaimBuster	14346				And ended up we had more votes than he had, then they decided to pull the plug.	1
ClaimBuster	14347				Another one that's uh - that's very important is the uh - is the business deductions, uh - jet airplanes, uh - first class travel, the fifty-dollar martini lunch.	0
ClaimBuster	14348				I think it is a deterrent.	0
ClaimBuster	14349				So that's -- that's number one.	0
ClaimBuster	14350				Just look at those little children, and if anybody can even think about legalizing drugs, they've lost me.	0
ClaimBuster	14351				Why threaten our space satellites upon which we depend?	0
ClaimBuster	14352				And it would be one to take Government off the backs of the great people of this country, and turn you loose again to do those things that I know you can do so well, because you did them and made this country great.	0
ClaimBuster	14353				Do you know that it's gone completely out of control to the point where it corrupts people?	0
ClaimBuster	14354				And so, in terms of bringing down deductions, one way of doing that would be say everybody gets -- I'll pick a number -- $25,000 of deductions and credits, and you can decide which ones to use.	0
ClaimBuster	14355				The whole world has had economic problems.	1
ClaimBuster	14356				We ought to have universal pre-school and we ought to make college tuition tax deductible, up to $10,000 a year.	0
ClaimBuster	14357				I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	14358				In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city.	1
ClaimBuster	14359				But - and I, look, mental - that was a little overstated it.	0
ClaimBuster	14360				I believe it's essential that we do it because in the next ten years the balance of power is going to begin to move in the world from one direction or another - towards us or towards the Communists - and unless we begin to identify ourselves not only with the anti-Communist fight, but also with the fight against poverty and hunger, these people are going to begin to turn to the Communists as an example.	0
ClaimBuster	14361				All 50 states did it.	1
ClaimBuster	14362				And I'm standing here as someone who, a long time ago as the county attorney in Russell, Kansas, one of our jobs every month was go through all the welfare checks and sign them.	1
ClaimBuster	14363				Well, why don't -- why don't -- let's talk about this, Tom, because there was just a lot of stuff out there.	0
ClaimBuster	14364				But now we can, we ought to pass this budget now and put ten years on it right away so no one has to worry about it.	0
ClaimBuster	14365				Now I want to go further.	0
ClaimBuster	14366				But we also have to deal with drug education prevention here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	14367				And therefore, I've always believed that a mother, if medically it is determined that her life is at risk if she goes through with the pregnancy, she has a right then to take the life of even her own unborn child in defense of her own.	0
ClaimBuster	14368				I think it was one of the things that Mr. Bush said about Mr. Reagan back in 1980.	1
ClaimBuster	14369				And on the assault weapon ban, out of 17 weapons that were banned, only six banned now because eleven have been modified and are back on the street.	1
ClaimBuster	14370				I believe this economy is sound and that we're going to move up.	0
ClaimBuster	14371				An election law just in the last few days.	0
ClaimBuster	14372				But I really don't think there's anything that I could say to President Truman that's going to cause him, at the age of seventy-six, to change his particular speaking manner.	0
ClaimBuster	14373				But I believe that by the end of the first four years of uh - of the next term we could have the unemployment down to 3 percent adult unemployment, which is about uh - 4 to 4 and a half percent overall uh controlled inflation rate and have a uh balance of growth of about - uh 4 to 6 percent, around 5 percent which would give us a balanced budget.	1
ClaimBuster	14374				We have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off.	0
ClaimBuster	14375				I mean, we've cut defense spending too much in the first place.	1
ClaimBuster	14376				But let me respond to what you said.	0
ClaimBuster	14377				The President has not called for an unconditional end to the violence.	1
ClaimBuster	14378				And the flow of imports into this country is swamping the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	14379				We need to put health care records online.	0
ClaimBuster	14380				The other thing that we have to focus on, though, is Al Qaida.	0
ClaimBuster	14381				I think the American people have a right to judge us on this question, on how we picked a running mate, a person who is a heartbeat away from the presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	14382				And, 5, I would have an aggressive program of school reform, more choices -- I favor public schools or these new charter schools -- we can talk about that if you want.	0
ClaimBuster	14383				We didn't need that tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	14384				But maybe I misunderstand where you're coming from, Mr. Vice President, but I think the United States must be humble and must be proud and confident of our values, but humble in how we treat nations that are figuring out how to chart their own course.	0
ClaimBuster	14385				But they weren't taken care of.	0
ClaimBuster	14386				Okay, I thought I answered it by saying that it would be on the basis of merit.	0
ClaimBuster	14387				I promise you the economy is going to get better.	0
ClaimBuster	14388				Let me say there is only one uh - point I would add.	0
ClaimBuster	14389				America has never gotten in a war because we were too strong.	0
ClaimBuster	14390				And I don't want to do that, and I won't do that.	0
ClaimBuster	14391				And our enemies are strengthened from all of this.	0
ClaimBuster	14392				I'm going to work with Democrats and Republicans to reform the system.	0
ClaimBuster	14393				I guess the question I would ask of Mr. Bush is how we instill those values, how we create this environment for the drug free schools that we want in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	14394				He got a deferment or he didn't.	0
ClaimBuster	14395				They've always had stakes in it.	0
ClaimBuster	14396				So we have to have, in my judgment, a drastic simplification of the basic health insurance policies of this country, be very comprehensive for everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	14397				If I'm elected we won't have Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	14398				Well, his rhetoric doesn't match his record.	1
ClaimBuster	14399				Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is.	0
ClaimBuster	14400				If I may just briefly, Jim, note.	0
ClaimBuster	14401				I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress.	0
ClaimBuster	14402				Now, both of us are kind of, I guess, stating the other's position in a maximalist extreme way, but I think there is a difference here.	0
ClaimBuster	14403				We can't do that to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	14404				So, we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending -- the increase, rate of increase in government spending, which has come down from 17 to 6 percent, and, at the same time, as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the Government gets, without raising taxes, those two lines will meet.	1
ClaimBuster	14405				So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share.	0
ClaimBuster	14406				Look, it's just not true.	0
ClaimBuster	14407				It not only happened in California.	1
ClaimBuster	14408				But let me take the other side of the coin, if I might.	0
ClaimBuster	14409				The interests of the American people must be at stake.	0
ClaimBuster	14410				You see, he's proposed $2.2 trillion of new spending.	1
ClaimBuster	14411				And we could be moving out to the human population a whole lot faster than we are on some of these new drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	14412				World peace is important, and we have enhanced the peace.	1
ClaimBuster	14413				We met the goals this year, but in the previous years we have not met recruiting goals.	1
ClaimBuster	14414				She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada.	1
ClaimBuster	14415				And I have to make that judgment.	1
ClaimBuster	14416				All of the things that she's talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let's say, while she had great power.	0
ClaimBuster	14417				So I made a mistake, and I -- you know, the difference, I think, is that I knew at the time I was going to take a lot of political flak.	0
ClaimBuster	14418				But, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing?	0
ClaimBuster	14419				This is the first administration since the bomb went off that made no progress.	1
ClaimBuster	14420				It had nothing to do with the transfer of payments from government by way of many programs.	0
ClaimBuster	14421				I do want to make sure that...	0
ClaimBuster	14422				I think it take fresh leadership now, and an understanding of those forces of change to provide the kind of strength that we need, and perhaps the vice president can explain what he was doing when he supported the trading of arms to terrorist nation, and his involvement in Panama and that endorsement of Mr. Macros.	1
ClaimBuster	14423				I am in favor, as the president has said, and I agree with him, which is that if people have committed crimes we got to get them out of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	14424				I didn't know any of these -- I didn't see these women.	1
ClaimBuster	14425				And I also think it's very important to go to the next stage of welfare reform.	0
ClaimBuster	14426				the most stringent of safety requirements, could meet our energy needs for the next couple of decades while we go forward exploring the areas of solar power and other forms of energy that might be renewable and that would not be exhaustible.	0
ClaimBuster	14427				"They're trying to say, ""Did you make a mistake going into Iraq?"""	0
ClaimBuster	14428				He didn't take that position on Tibet.	1
ClaimBuster	14429				Because they have to balance their budgets.	0
ClaimBuster	14430				And have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	14431				I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just -- just came in.	1
ClaimBuster	14432				There's another, a similar issue out there that relates to your -- it is said, at least, that you were unaware that the Soviet retaliatory power was based on land-based missiles.	1
ClaimBuster	14433				We should key our foreign aid, our direct foreign investment, and that of our friends, we should coordinate it to make sure that we -- we push back and give them more economic development.	0
ClaimBuster	14434				Because if it is, I should win easily, it was so bad.	0
ClaimBuster	14435				Every 4 years, they send you all kinds of messages to tell you how to vote and then go back to business as usual.	0
ClaimBuster	14436				We announce we're going after Mosul.	1
ClaimBuster	14437				I'm not even certain you were too excited about that.	0
ClaimBuster	14438				I've gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I've been doing this as a politician.	1
ClaimBuster	14439				It's a fairly rural state.	1
ClaimBuster	14440				The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents.	0
ClaimBuster	14441				But it's in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it's not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody.	1
ClaimBuster	14442				The s- I believe the Soviet Union is first in outer space.	0
ClaimBuster	14443				Secondly, Senator Dole had some pretty harsh comments about special interest money, but it wasn't me who opposed what we tried to do to save the lives of children who were subject to tobacco and then went to the tobacco growers and bragged about standing up for the Federal government when we tried to stop the advertising, marketing, and sales of tobacco to children.	1
ClaimBuster	14444				Because, when we sell these new products here, we'll then be able to sell them overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	14445				And we need to do something about that.	0
ClaimBuster	14446				Well, you don't realize we have a hate crimes statute?	0
ClaimBuster	14447				This is a great land.	0
ClaimBuster	14448				And I believe that the right of choice is a constitutional right.	0
ClaimBuster	14449				But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person.	0
ClaimBuster	14450				Now, I think that's the right strategy; I think that's the right policy.	0
ClaimBuster	14451				Let me give you another example.	0
ClaimBuster	14452				There is a tax gap.	1
ClaimBuster	14453				It is 1.3 trillion Mr. Vice President.	1
ClaimBuster	14454				But having said that, America -- and we'll hear a lot of criticism.	0
ClaimBuster	14455				That's one of my promises.	0
ClaimBuster	14456				We've had an opportunity to campaign all over this country and to meet with so many of you in communities and states and regions to get to know you.	1
ClaimBuster	14457				"You know, they even had the Defense Department issue a memorandum saying, ""Don't bother applying for assistance or for being part of the reconstruction if you weren't part of our original coalition."""	1
ClaimBuster	14458				And we can enforce law.	0
ClaimBuster	14459				What I care about is children.	0
ClaimBuster	14460				So I changed the Justice Department's effort to get a church to pay back a man tithe, because he was bankrupt when he gave it.	1
ClaimBuster	14461				"I've got post-traumatic stress disorder, and yet I can't get treatment."""	1
ClaimBuster	14462				"And that institution, the House of Representatives -- everyone is yelling ""Clean House!"""	1
ClaimBuster	14463				That is my solemn obligation.	0
ClaimBuster	14464				In Lebanon, this President exercised American power, all right, but the management of it was such that our marines were killed, we had to leave in humiliation, the Soviet Union became stronger, terrorists became emboldened.	1
ClaimBuster	14465				There's been a consistent policy on the part of this administration to lower or delay enforcement of air pollution standards and water pollution standards.	1
ClaimBuster	14466				I'm talking about giving him four or five tools - not only the fact-finding committee that he now has under the injunction provision, not only the injunction, but also the power of the fact-finding commission to make recommendations - recommendations which would not be binding, but nevertheless would have great force of public opinion behind them.	0
ClaimBuster	14467				In Houston there's been a 15- percent drop in the crime rate in the last year because of the work the mayor did there in increasing the police force.	1
ClaimBuster	14468				That's why exports have significantly increased under my presidency.	1
ClaimBuster	14469				People will tell you who served with Bob Dole, agree or disagree, he kept his word.	0
ClaimBuster	14470				We have a Democratic Congress today, and fortunately we've had a Republican president to check their excesses with my vetoes.	1
ClaimBuster	14471				When I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over.	1
ClaimBuster	14472				We have strengthened enforcement, and everybody in San Diego knows we strengthened control of the border.	1
ClaimBuster	14473				I'd never ask you to do anything for me, but I owe you this, and I'm doing it for you.	0
ClaimBuster	14474				You attended a private school for some time in your life.	1
ClaimBuster	14475				We've got to do something about this.	0
ClaimBuster	14476				I know those things can grow out of despair in an inner city, when there's hopelessness at home, lack of work, and so forth.	0
ClaimBuster	14477				We don't have to settle for 47 million people on food stamps.	0
ClaimBuster	14478				And we are going to make sure that we manage chronic illnesses, like diabetes and heart disease, that cost a huge amount, but could be prevented.	0
ClaimBuster	14479				A Gallup Poll taken in February of this year asking the - in eight out of nine countries - they asked the people, who do they think would be ahead by 1970 militarily and scientifically, and a majority in eight of the nine countries said the Soviet Union would be by 1970.	1
ClaimBuster	14480				We've never had any difficulty finding time to pray.	0
ClaimBuster	14481				But taking that one no from the Soviet Union, we then went back into negotiations on their terms, because Mr. Carter had canceled the B-I bomber, delayed the MX, delayed the Trident submarine, delayed the cruise missile, shut down the Missile Man - the three - the Minuteman missile production line, and whatever other things that might have been done.	1
ClaimBuster	14482				And we saw the Governor and his son on television the night before and his family, and his mother who was there.	1
ClaimBuster	14483				But it is true our borders are out of control.	0
ClaimBuster	14484				And all of her donors -- just about all of them -- I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars...	1
ClaimBuster	14485				I'm not going to set the White House visitors schedule before I'm president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	14486				Surely we can afford 5% of the $25 trillion that are coming into the treasury to the hard working people that pay the bills.	1
ClaimBuster	14487				These commitments that the Democratic Party has historically made to the working families of this nation have been extremely important to the growth in their stature and in a better quality of life for them.	0
ClaimBuster	14488				You take these big companies, these trade deals are far bigger than these companies, and yet we don't use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary, I must say.	0
ClaimBuster	14489				The American people are pretty smart: they know who writes out the checks.	0
ClaimBuster	14490				Senator Kennedy has expressed some hopes in this field, hopes which I think all Americans would share who want some problem - some progress in this area.	0
ClaimBuster	14491				She asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what I'm going through.	1
ClaimBuster	14492				Why the hell didn't you do it over the last 15, 20 years?	0
ClaimBuster	14493				Less than two hundred for all the countries of Africa and they need trained leadership more than anything.	1
ClaimBuster	14494				Well first of all, I don't agree with Senator Kennedy that Cuba is lost and certainly China was lost when this Administration came into power in 1953.	1
ClaimBuster	14495				When I talked about the automakers, they are obviously getting hammered right now.	0
ClaimBuster	14496				We need to make it clear we're for human liberty.	0
ClaimBuster	14497				I want to thank Washington University for hosting us here this evening.	0
ClaimBuster	14498				That's the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower.	1
ClaimBuster	14499				And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	14500				I believe we should be stronger than we now are.	0
ClaimBuster	14501				You can't ship them overseas anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	14502				I know what it's like to go out on one of those missions when you don't know what's around the corner.	0
ClaimBuster	14503				Uh - this would - would help a great deal.	0
ClaimBuster	14504				The top 5 percent will continue to pay 60 percent, as they do today.	1
ClaimBuster	14505				Plus, he says the cornerstone of his plan to succeed in Iraq is to call upon nations to serve.	1
ClaimBuster	14506				Now, I believe, also, that this meeting this mission, this responsibility for preserving the peace, which I believe is a responsibility peculiar to our country, and that we cannot shirk our responsibility as a leader of the free world because we're the only ones that can do it.	0
ClaimBuster	14507				It's a culture that somewhere along the line we've begun to disrespect life.	0
ClaimBuster	14508				I think once it gets into productive stages, that we ought to, obviously, turn it over to the private sector.	0
ClaimBuster	14509				It only whets their appetite; and then the question comes, when do you stop them?	0
ClaimBuster	14510				We now import about 44 percent of our oil.	1
ClaimBuster	14511				Well, it can only have the effect certainly of reducing it.	0
ClaimBuster	14512				I believe we need incentive for the individual, and for business and industry, and I believe the plan that I have submitted, with detailed backing, and which has been approved by a number of our leading economists in the country, is based on projections.	1
ClaimBuster	14513				You cannot lead if you send mixed messages.	0
ClaimBuster	14514				"And she looked at me from her hospital bed and she just looked at me and she said, ""Remember: integrity, integrity, integrity."	1
ClaimBuster	14515				You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible -- you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land -- we've become a third world country.	1
ClaimBuster	14516				I was talking about early childhood education for disadvantaged little children.	1
ClaimBuster	14517				I take my job seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	14518				And I know there are some in our party that disagree with that sentiment.	0
ClaimBuster	14519				And among those vetoes, I stopped $16 billion in additional spending.	1
ClaimBuster	14520				Now you say maybe or it depends, which means not only were you wrong, but you were also confusing in sending mixed messages both to our troops and our allies.	0
ClaimBuster	14521				And the last statement, just a few days ago, was a speech to the effect that we have inflation because Government revenues have not kept pace with Government spending.	1
ClaimBuster	14522				He said that no man with that size misery index has a right to seek reelection to the Presidency.	1
ClaimBuster	14523				In the past, the relationship between Social Security and Medicare has been very important to providing some modicum of aid for senior citizens in the retention of health benefits.	0
ClaimBuster	14524				Again we turn to the past.	0
ClaimBuster	14525				Are we better of with this arms race?	0
ClaimBuster	14526				I've always been against them.	1
ClaimBuster	14527				Nothing's going to ever happen.	0
ClaimBuster	14528				There's a lot of shut-in gas that we need to be moving out of Alaska by pipeline.	1
ClaimBuster	14529				It's an issue throughout our society.	0
ClaimBuster	14530				I think any time we end with one of these attacks, it's appropriate to respond.	0
ClaimBuster	14531				It used to be that the average - uh family could own a house.	1
ClaimBuster	14532				A record is never something to stand on.	0
ClaimBuster	14533				We're bringing our jobs back.	0
ClaimBuster	14534				Hey, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, because what Joe wanted to do was buy the business that he's been working for 10-12 hours a day, seven days a week, and you said that you wanted to spread the wealth, but -- in other words, take Joe's money and then you decide what to do with it.	0
ClaimBuster	14535				So what do we do?	0
ClaimBuster	14536				We need to strengthen that in order to assure our Western allies of our presence there, a strong defense, but also to diminish and reduce the likelihood of a commencement of a war and the use of nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	14537				Now, it's $4.00 a gallon.	1
ClaimBuster	14538				My opponent, in that he's out of the mainstream, voted against that law.	1
ClaimBuster	14539				It's called Immediate Helping Hand.	1
ClaimBuster	14540				But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is -- there's been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government.	0
ClaimBuster	14541				Thanks a lot for doing a great job.	0
ClaimBuster	14542				Well, I did with my first statement.	1
ClaimBuster	14543				"I've had shop stewards stand up and say, ""Will you promise me you're going to stop all this outsourcing?"	1
ClaimBuster	14544				We're proud to be here.	0
ClaimBuster	14545				Apparently what they've done is they were paying people to go out and register folks, and apparently some of the people who were out there didn't really register people, they just filled out a bunch of names.	1
ClaimBuster	14546				See, what you see is what you get and if you don't like it, you got two other choices, right?	0
ClaimBuster	14547				And the exit strategy needs to be well-defined.	0
ClaimBuster	14548				... as I said, trumped-up trickle-down.	0
ClaimBuster	14549				When the -- when the president of Iraq -- excuse me, of Iran, Ahmadinejad, says that our debt makes us not a great country, that's a frightening thing.	1
ClaimBuster	14550				No, I don't think that's the right answer.	0
ClaimBuster	14551				I want to first, obviously, thank Belmont University, Tom, thank you, and to all of you who are participating tonight and those of you who sent e-mail questions in.	0
ClaimBuster	14552				And so the question here tonight is not where we've been, but where we're going.	0
ClaimBuster	14553				If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.	1
ClaimBuster	14554				We can't sanction them any more.	0
ClaimBuster	14555				Came out and told the truth in this brilliant book, Against All Hope, about what is actually happening in Cuba.	1
ClaimBuster	14556				What we're going to give you is a 50 percent tax credit to help provide health care for those that you need.	0
ClaimBuster	14557				She had a chance to do something with Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	14558				Are you suggesting that if somebody has means that the national debt doesn't affect them?	0
ClaimBuster	14559				We need more resources there.	0
ClaimBuster	14560				And I have great respect and admiration for his wife.	0
ClaimBuster	14561				Sometimes it does seem that a campaign generates more heat than light.	0
ClaimBuster	14562				Uh - what we're doing is saying that there are opportunities, business opportunities, educational opportunities, responsibilities uh - where people with talent, black or any other minority, can fully qualify.	1
ClaimBuster	14563				And I thank you, and I thank you, my friend.	0
ClaimBuster	14564				I also presented to the Congress and they adopted a large package of quality-of-life improvements, which are very important.	1
ClaimBuster	14565				Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you.	0
ClaimBuster	14566				We have to have nuclear power.	0
ClaimBuster	14567				But it won't be on my timetable, it will be on the timetable that people are comfortable with in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	14568				I disagree that we need 150,000 troops to fulfill our role in Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	14569				The President wants to increase spending 20 percent over the next six years.	1
ClaimBuster	14570				And so, this is a reasonable policy to protect old stands of trees and at the same time make sure our forests aren't vulnerable to the forest fires that have destroyed acres after acres in the West.	1
ClaimBuster	14571				See, I think the mission has somewhat become fuzzy.	0
ClaimBuster	14572				Not one of them are paid for.	1
ClaimBuster	14573				So let's go through them one by one.	0
ClaimBuster	14574				Now Senator Obama talks about the very, very rich.	0
ClaimBuster	14575				Well, let me just said that that this is -- he -- Senator Obama doesn't want a free trade agreement with our best ally in the region but wants to sit down across the table without precondition to -- with Hugo Chavez, the guy who has been helping FARC, the terrorist organization.	1
ClaimBuster	14576				It can be an engine that drives us into the future the same way the computer was the engine for economic growth over the last couple of decades.	0
ClaimBuster	14577				I think it's going to require good, solid credit policies.	0
ClaimBuster	14578				I'm here with a group of 13 people from around the country who helped me prepare.	1
ClaimBuster	14579				And this is what the Republicans have done to us.	0
ClaimBuster	14580				"This is different from saying, ""OK, let me incent you to go on the government."""	0
ClaimBuster	14581				Five million homes were lost.	1
ClaimBuster	14582				It is the same overall strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	14583				I know who I am, and I know where I'm from, and I know where I want to take America.	0
ClaimBuster	14584				We can't continue to shuffle children through school.	0
ClaimBuster	14585				You see, last year in the primary, he expressed his passion.	1
ClaimBuster	14586				And I want to continue those tax cuts for middle-class families, and for small business.	0
ClaimBuster	14587				And I'm glad we're going in the right direction.	0
ClaimBuster	14588				This country uh - changed drastically in 1969 when the uh - terms of John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were over and Richard Nixon and - and Gerald Ford became the presidents.	1
ClaimBuster	14589				There is a partnership involved in our nation.	0
ClaimBuster	14590				But Social Security is a tax.	0
ClaimBuster	14591				There's a lot of good people working hard.	0
ClaimBuster	14592				But in order to stop this arms madness, we've got to push ahead with tough negotiations that are verifiable so that we know the Soviets are agreeing and living up to their agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	14593				And they really matter when you are president.	0
ClaimBuster	14594				Now, you got to stop letting these people tell you who to vote for, you got to stop letting these folks in the press tell you you're throwing your vote away -- you got to start using your own head.	0
ClaimBuster	14595				Now, because the governor has all this money for a tax cut mostly to the wealthy, there is no money left over, so schools get testing and lawsuit reform and not much else.	1
ClaimBuster	14596				I subscribe to the Justice Potter Stewart standard.	1
ClaimBuster	14597				As a matter of fact, one of the secretaries of HEW under Mr. Carter testified that he thought there was $7 billion worth of fraud and waste in welfare and in the medical programs associated with it.	1
ClaimBuster	14598				Whose taxes will you raise?	0
ClaimBuster	14599				And the thing I find the most troubling about Obama Care, well it's a long list, but one of the things I find most troubling is that when you go out and talk to small businesses and ask them what they think about it, they tell you it keeps them from hiring more people.	0
ClaimBuster	14600				And we're going to do it by investing in prevention.	0
ClaimBuster	14601				Well, I would say first of all, I think, it's a very good question.	0
ClaimBuster	14602				One of the reasons that I ran for president, Sandy, is because not just children, a lot of grownups felt that way.	0
ClaimBuster	14603				And, incidentally, may I say that that's the decision of the Congress, and the president has concurred.	0
ClaimBuster	14604				They will live the American dream.	0
ClaimBuster	14605				I believe in this goal and effort with all my heart.	0
ClaimBuster	14606				Now we have this incredible mess in Iraq -- $200 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	14607				Senator Dole said 30 years ago he was one of 12 people who voted against Medicare and he was proud of it.	1
ClaimBuster	14608				And to spend billions and billions of dollars as Mr. Bush apparently wants to, although, he, himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately-on Star Wars-in my judgment makes no sense at all.	0
ClaimBuster	14609				We've had record numbers of new small businesses and 10 and a half million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	14610				I look at the trial lawyers, and when you're a few million short, you run out to Hollywood and pick up two to four million and organized labor comes to Washington, D.C. and puts 35 million into the pot.	0
ClaimBuster	14611				I made a decision not to join the International Criminal Court in The Hague, which is where our troops could be brought to -- brought in front of a judge, an unaccounted judge.	1
ClaimBuster	14612				That was locker room talk.	1
ClaimBuster	14613				Their budget cut $270 billion in Medicare and, finally, their budget withdrew the national guarantee of healthcare to poor children, families with children with handicaps, the elderly in nursing homes, poor pregnant women.	1
ClaimBuster	14614				What he said was a precipitous...	0
ClaimBuster	14615				...because the private sector's not going to invest in a...	0
ClaimBuster	14616				If I become president, I'll get America working again.	0
ClaimBuster	14617				We need to explore our resources and we need to develop our reservoirs of domestic production.	0
ClaimBuster	14618				Not with the measure that leaves the majority of them without any real basic help until the next president's term of four years is over.	1
ClaimBuster	14619				And so I just have to say, it's fine.	0
ClaimBuster	14620				... is if your -- if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that.	0
ClaimBuster	14621				I want the federal government, consistent with local control and new accountability, to make improvement of our schools the number one priority so Caley will have a desk and can sit down in a classroom where she can learn.	0
ClaimBuster	14622				We could have an urban homestead act.	0
ClaimBuster	14623				It wouldn't be fair for me to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	14624				But take Russia, for example.	0
ClaimBuster	14625				I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, we're thinking of dropping our insurance, we can't afford it.	1
ClaimBuster	14626				And I'd like to know where have we been defeated and where have we retreated?	0
ClaimBuster	14627				We need to say we each need to be responsible for what we do.	0
ClaimBuster	14628				I think a lot of times we just spend aid and say we feel better about it and it ends up being spent the wrong way, and there's some pretty egregious examples recently.	0
ClaimBuster	14629				And now our kids are being killed with ammos right out of that dump.	0
ClaimBuster	14630				When we talk about cutting health care costs, let's start with the insurance companies and the people that are making a killing instead of making our people healthy.	0
ClaimBuster	14631				And once you're out on your own with this $5,000 credit, Senator McCain, for the first time, is going to be taxing the health care benefits that you have from your employer.	1
ClaimBuster	14632				Curriculum that works and phonics needs to be an integral part of our reading curriculum.	0
ClaimBuster	14633				I believe that we have to win this.	0
ClaimBuster	14634				Now, and -- and I've talked to a guy who has a very small business.	1
ClaimBuster	14635				I, too, thank the University of Miami, and say our prayers are with the good people of this state, who've suffered a lot.	0
ClaimBuster	14636				Because more people qualify for them because they don't have money.	1
ClaimBuster	14637				And we've been guilty of that.	0
ClaimBuster	14638				"Frankly, I'm not going to tell that person without health insurance that, ""I'm sorry, you'll have to wait."""	0
ClaimBuster	14639				I think that homeowners have to be respected and their right to have a gun if they wish to.	0
ClaimBuster	14640				And I would institute the same kind of procedure as president, not only in judicial appointments, but also in diplomatic appointments.	0
ClaimBuster	14641				They're supposed to be our first line of defense against drugs and the war against drugs, because they don't have enough fuel.	0
ClaimBuster	14642				I will never let those troops down, and will hunt and kill the terrorists wherever they are.	0
ClaimBuster	14643				Now when the president ran for office, he said that he'd put in place, in his first year, a piece of legislation -- he'd file a bill in his first year that would reform our -- our immigration system, protect legal immigration, stop illegal immigration.	1
ClaimBuster	14644				You know what he said?	0
ClaimBuster	14645				You take a look at what's happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies.	1
ClaimBuster	14646				Now 60 percent go to the Arab countries, and this does not include Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	14647				I think that our goal ought to be first of all not to politicize it, not to frighten people; secondly to say that we have to enforce the law in 2 ways.	0
ClaimBuster	14648				As Commander in Chief, I will maintain the strongest military in the world, keep faith with our troops and go after those who would do us harm.	0
ClaimBuster	14649				Now, whether preemption is ultimately what has to happen, I don't know yet.	0
ClaimBuster	14650				What about the honor of my state?	0
ClaimBuster	14651				I've made no judgment about who should be secretary of state.	0
ClaimBuster	14652				Mine is rooted in the real lives of real people, and it will bring real results if we have the courage to change.	0
ClaimBuster	14653				And so people are going to have to look at the record.	0
ClaimBuster	14654				People who got all the jobs were benefiting.	0
ClaimBuster	14655				Look, we are in tough economic times; we all know that.	0
ClaimBuster	14656				One is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and they're effectively guaranteed by the federal government.	1
ClaimBuster	14657				and kind of humiliating them is not the way you make the kind of progress we are getting.	0
ClaimBuster	14658				Now, looking to the U-2 flights, I would like to point out that I have been supporting the President's position throughout.	1
ClaimBuster	14659				I'm glad you clarified it.	0
ClaimBuster	14660				Are we going to step up to the plate as a nation the way we did after World War II, the way that generation of heroes said okay, the United States is going to be the leader.	0
ClaimBuster	14661				But look, what's really important, Charlie, is the president is just trying to scare everybody here with throwing labels around.	1
ClaimBuster	14662				So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system.	1
ClaimBuster	14663				These folks have had eight years to get something done in Washington, D.C. on the uninsured.	1
ClaimBuster	14664				It's a scaring -- he's trying to scare people in the voting booth.	0
ClaimBuster	14665				I've reached out to people all my life.	1
ClaimBuster	14666				There is a thing called clean coal.	1
ClaimBuster	14667				Well, let me just make a closing point.	0
ClaimBuster	14668				Number one, make sure that other countries are as open to our markets as our markets are to them, and, if they're not, have measures on the books that don't take forever and a day to implement.	0
ClaimBuster	14669				Ninety percent of the costs are coming out of your pockets.	1
ClaimBuster	14670				The vice president and I have a disagreement about the use of troops.	1
ClaimBuster	14671				Joe Lieberman and I gave them six months to clean up their act.	1
ClaimBuster	14672				In 1979 he made similar statements, the same effect, that the deficits -- there was nothing wrong with having deficits.	1
ClaimBuster	14673				That's how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and that's how we're going to wind down the war in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	14674				America is not standing still.	0
ClaimBuster	14675				I'm worried about our country.	0
ClaimBuster	14676				Now we have uh such a grossly unbalanced tax system - as I said earlier, that it is a disgrace - ah of all the tax - benefits now, 25 percent of 'em go to the 1 percent of the richest people in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	14677				It's small business that creates the jobs in America, and over the last four years, small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30-year low.	1
ClaimBuster	14678				I think the foremost responsibility of a president really gets down to the national security of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	14679				I ask for your vote.	0
ClaimBuster	14680				We are now spending $10 billion or more every month.	1
ClaimBuster	14681				My path is designed in getting small businesses to grow and hire people.	1
ClaimBuster	14682				So the point is -- the point is that I have repudiated every time someone's been out of line, whether they've been part of my campaign or not, and I will continue to do that.	1
ClaimBuster	14683				They're fighting us because they're fighting freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	14684				This is a perfect example of the kind of leadership that the United States, under this administration, has taken.	0
ClaimBuster	14685				Mr. George Allen, head of your Information Service, has said that that made the people of the world begin to wonder whether we were first in science.	1
ClaimBuster	14686				We passed a bill again this year in the cong- in the Senate and it died in the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives.	1
ClaimBuster	14687				Well, first of all, it's not government that makes business successful.	0
ClaimBuster	14688				We need to reform Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	14689				You have to learn from experience that making unilateral cuts in defense system is not the way that you enhance peace.	0
ClaimBuster	14690				A number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns.	1
ClaimBuster	14691				So I think it is a case of pay scale, of recognizing that if we're going to have young men and women responsible for our security, dealing with this sophisticated equipment, then for heaven's sakes, let's go out and have a pay scale that is commensurate with the sacrifice that we're asking of them.	0
ClaimBuster	14692				"As a matter of fact, I read in the ""New York Times"" where he said he co-sponsored the McCain-Feingold Campaign Fundraising Bill."	1
ClaimBuster	14693				If you think that I am a spoiler, consider these facts: Do you really think that our economy is healthy?	0
ClaimBuster	14694				I've been AWOL for 44 months, so let's take on smoking, see they haven't even done it.	1
ClaimBuster	14695				And the president supports taking $716 billion out of that program.	1
ClaimBuster	14696				If I'm president I will create -- help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes.	0
ClaimBuster	14697				And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg.	1
ClaimBuster	14698				We had someone who I'm sure regrets said it in the president's staff said he didn't care whether we made potato chips or computer chips.	1
ClaimBuster	14699				And we'll continue to protect our borders.	0
ClaimBuster	14700				That's a tribute to their interest in this election.	0
ClaimBuster	14701				They create government-sponsored health care.	1
ClaimBuster	14702				You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it.	1
ClaimBuster	14703				President Bush and I are -- are different people and these are different times and that's why my five point plan is so different than what he would have done.	0
ClaimBuster	14704				I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don't always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise.	1
ClaimBuster	14705				Well, again, the president didn't answer the question.	1
ClaimBuster	14706				"We said, ""Peace through strength,"" and it worked and the cold war is over."	1
ClaimBuster	14707				90 percent of our kids are out there in those public schools and we need to lift their standards and move them forward with the programs like those I've outlined in this campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	14708				He's troubled, as I am, by some of the things that go on today.	0
ClaimBuster	14709				Because if you want to cut the cost of campaigns, you have to open the airways, because what drives the cost of campaigns are the cost of advertising on television, radio, newspaper, mass mailing.	1
ClaimBuster	14710				And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.	0
ClaimBuster	14711				And then, with the economy that would be generated from a restraint on spending, and a tax uh reduction primarily for the middle-income people, then I think the American people would be willing to make those sacrifices for peace and prosperity in the next uh - four years.	0
ClaimBuster	14712				The federal government didn't hire our teachers.	1
ClaimBuster	14713				We've got to help the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	14714				But they weren't running for president, and in retrospect, from hindsight, I would not have given that uh - interview had I do it - had it - I to do it over again.	0
ClaimBuster	14715				When Mr. Carter became President, inflation was 4.8%, as you said.	1
ClaimBuster	14716				There must be an absolute guarantee.	0
ClaimBuster	14717				And then what you've got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care.	0
ClaimBuster	14718				You know, just a couple of weeks ago, actually, probably about a month, I saw a mother, who I had met at the bedside of her son, who had been shot in that theater.	1
ClaimBuster	14719				The governor wants to divert 1 out of every $6 off into the stock market, which means that he would drain a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund in this generation over the next ten years, and Social Security under that approach would go bankrupt within this generation.	1
ClaimBuster	14720				They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance -- your insurance plan until you're 26 years old.	1
ClaimBuster	14721				But I have a fundamental belief in the goodness and strength of the American worker.	0
ClaimBuster	14722				Some of them got it for a birthday present.	1
ClaimBuster	14723				Well, I thought the question was about defense.	0
ClaimBuster	14724				That was vouchers, Senator Obama.	1
ClaimBuster	14725				There's no way of glossing around that.	0
ClaimBuster	14726				... unfit, and he proves it every time he talks.	0
ClaimBuster	14727				I never could have dreamed anything like this would come my way in life, and I've done my best to be faithful to the charge you've given me.	0
ClaimBuster	14728				I believe that uh - our foreign policy must express the highest standards of morality.	0
ClaimBuster	14729				To me, Affirmative Action is making that extra effort.	0
ClaimBuster	14730				When George Bush came into office, our debt -- national debt was around $5 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	14731				I think that we ought to have an expanded conservation reserve program.	0
ClaimBuster	14732				That's the enemy that is now in 60 countries, with stronger recruits.	1
ClaimBuster	14733				And maybe it's just our difference in government, the way we view government.	0
ClaimBuster	14734				I just couldn't let it stand.	0
ClaimBuster	14735				Imagine what it -- what it is like for someone to be singled out unfairly, unjustly, and feel the unfair force of law simply because of race or ethnicity.	0
ClaimBuster	14736				First, the National Journal named Senator Kennedy the most liberal senator of all.	1
ClaimBuster	14737				I wasn't misleading when I said he was a threat.	0
ClaimBuster	14738				That's quite different than taking a position where you know it's best for you.	0
ClaimBuster	14739				With regard to assailing Mr. Bush about his tax problems and the difference from the tax he once paid and then the later tax he paid, I think if you looked at the deductions, there were great legal expenses in there -- had to do, possibly, with the sale of his home, and they had to do with his setting up of a blind trust.	0
ClaimBuster	14740				Or world where people have enough to eat and a world where we care about those who don't?	0
ClaimBuster	14741				As a matter of fact your question brings out a point that I am very glad to make.	0
ClaimBuster	14742				The last budget he led cut Pell Grants, cut student loans.	1
ClaimBuster	14743				There are some programs that are underfunded.	0
ClaimBuster	14744				A lot of them lost their lives.	1
ClaimBuster	14745				But let's turn for a minute to the uhh - southern African operations that are now going on.	0
ClaimBuster	14746				I can tell you at the same time, that we will make sure that we look at what's happening in Pakistan, and recognize that what's happening in Pakistan is going to have a major impact on the success in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	14747				Instead of answering people's questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that's his choice.	0
ClaimBuster	14748				I've worked on the food stamp program, proudly.	1
ClaimBuster	14749				We have to go to the root cause, and that is in Afghanistan and Pakistan.	0
ClaimBuster	14750				I think we need to have an attorney general that says if a law is broken, we'll enforce it.	0
ClaimBuster	14751				Now, to me that's not the strategy that I think people expect from America.	0
ClaimBuster	14752				We're using unmanned vehicles to spot people coming across.	1
ClaimBuster	14753				We had a BTU tax we turned into a $35 million gas tax, a $265 billion tax increase.	1
ClaimBuster	14754				It's also important to keep strong ties in the Middle East, credible ties, because of the energy crisis we're now in.	0
ClaimBuster	14755				And it is particularly terrible to take poor tiny little children and wait until the first grade and bus them across town to Mars, where the children know their numbers, know their letters, have had every advantage.	0
ClaimBuster	14756				So I would simply say, as these dates get close, you're going to have to reorganize and refix as we did with the Social Security Fund.	0
ClaimBuster	14757				No one is suggesting that.	0
ClaimBuster	14758				But I don't think it's just experience that makes the difference.	0
ClaimBuster	14759				It's one of my top priorities, Jim, to give every single child in the United States affordable health care within the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	14760				For -- so if you're -- if you're 54 or 55, you might want to listen 'cause this -- this will affect you.	1
ClaimBuster	14761				She's been trying to take them out for a long time.	1
ClaimBuster	14762				In a > Transfer interrupted!	0
ClaimBuster	14763				I believe in the greatness of our country, and I believe the American people are ready for a change in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	14764				I was in coal country in West Virginia yesterday.	1
ClaimBuster	14765				And Iraq is not even the center of the focus of the war on terror.	0
ClaimBuster	14766				And that is something that I'm going to be committed to as president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	14767				And, by the way, I want to go back a second.	0
ClaimBuster	14768				And I will not, under any circumstances increase taxes on the middle-class.	0
ClaimBuster	14769				She has no idea whether it's Russia, China, or anybody else.	0
ClaimBuster	14770				And we created an OSHA - an Occupational Safety and Health Agency - for the protection of employees before the Federal Government had one in place.	1
ClaimBuster	14771				I was just recently endorsed -- 16,500 Border Patrol agents.	1
ClaimBuster	14772				We have very fundamental differences about human rights, democracy and our basic system, our basic view of human beings and of what life is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	14773				There is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established.	0
ClaimBuster	14774				As far as college education is concerned, we need to make those student loans available.	0
ClaimBuster	14775				I'm not too popular sometimes with my own party, much less his.	0
ClaimBuster	14776				Now, I'd like to come back for a quick moment, if I can, to that issue about China and the talks.	0
ClaimBuster	14777				Maryland would not extradite Willie Horton, the man who was furloughed, the murderer, because they didn't want him to be furloughed again.	1
ClaimBuster	14778				And that additional 15 million barrels is going to cause scarcity.	0
ClaimBuster	14779				We had to go in when they came in.	0
ClaimBuster	14780				In Europe, we have massed troops as if the Soviet Union existed and was going to invade into Europe, but those days are over with.	0
ClaimBuster	14781				I might say the results are highly ambiguous.	0
ClaimBuster	14782				It may be a long period, but we must - we must get started immediately.	0
ClaimBuster	14783				Now, I think if we work together on it, and if you have a president that will work with the Congress and the American people, we can bring that deficit down steadily, $20, $25, $30 billion a year, build economic growth, build a good strong future for America, invest in those things which we must invest in economic development, good jobs, good schools for our kids, college opportunity for young people, decent health care and affordable housing, and a clean and safe environment.	0
ClaimBuster	14784				He said, if it's good enough for the congressmen and senators to have choice, seniors ought to have choice.	1
ClaimBuster	14785				And before you solve it, you have to say the name.	0
ClaimBuster	14786				That was the reason Congress gave him the authority to use force, not after excuse to get rid of the regime.	0
ClaimBuster	14787				You go into the inner cities and -- you see it's 45 percent poverty.	1
ClaimBuster	14788				Now, I also say that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, that, again, the question is not simply one of uh - a presidential veto stopping programs.	0
ClaimBuster	14789				But I believe together we can make great progress.	0
ClaimBuster	14790				There will be elections in January.	1
ClaimBuster	14791				So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform.	1
ClaimBuster	14792				You remember we increased that child credit by $1,000, reduced the marriage penalty, created a 10 percent tax bracket for the lower-income Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	14793				I just told this lady over here we spent -- went from $10 billion to $30 billion to protect the homeland.	1
ClaimBuster	14794				"When she was the head of their energy and natural resources board, she saw corruption, she resigned and said, ""This can't go on."""	1
ClaimBuster	14795				People's rights have been abused.	0
ClaimBuster	14796				And housing starts - he compares the housing starts with last year.	0
ClaimBuster	14797				But I also recognize that as the two great superpowers in the world, we have to live with each other.	0
ClaimBuster	14798				Not just at the high end.	0
ClaimBuster	14799				But she said she'll be awake.	1
ClaimBuster	14800				I have worked to support our country as the world's strongest force for peace and freedom, prosperity and security.	0
ClaimBuster	14801				What I want the voters to do is to make a decision.	0
ClaimBuster	14802				And we want to bring him to justice.	0
ClaimBuster	14803				And if Iraq were to fail, it'd be a haven for terrorists, and there would be money and the world would be much more dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	14804				So the work that we've done with respect to sanctions now offers Iran a choice.	1
ClaimBuster	14805				That's why we need a Democratic administration in Washington in 1989.	0
ClaimBuster	14806				I think the Atomic Energy Committee is prepared for it.	0
ClaimBuster	14807				And we can't do what Senator Obama wants to do.	0
ClaimBuster	14808				We have unbelievable -- we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet.	1
ClaimBuster	14809				I've worked hard to help families impart values to their own children.	0
ClaimBuster	14810				America needed to be safe.	0
ClaimBuster	14811				When Barbara holds an AIDS baby, she's showing a certain compassion for family; when she reads to children, the same thing.	0
ClaimBuster	14812				I have no quarrel whatsoever with the things that have been done, because I believe it is high time that the civilized countries of the world made it plain that there is no room worldwide for terrorism; there will be no negotiation with terrorists of any kind.	0
ClaimBuster	14813				We can do a better job of training the Iraqi forces to defend themselves, and I know that we can do a better job of preparing for elections.	0
ClaimBuster	14814				It would be a game changer.	0
ClaimBuster	14815				You got to send down some more people, because the president's found out there are death squads on his on his, in his own property.	1
ClaimBuster	14816				"We had a 20th-century mindset that basically said, ""Well, you know, he may be a dictator, but he's our dictator."""	0
ClaimBuster	14817				But I think the important thing--the important thing-- is to use the powers the president does have on the assumption that, given the condition of this economy, we're going to keep interest rates down if we have the discipline to increase investment and reduce the debt at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	14818				So if you analyze where we're out of line with other countries, you come up with the following conclusions.	0
ClaimBuster	14819				Now, we're now kidding anybody, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	14820				He voted against it and, obviously, we had to take Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait or it would've threatened the Middle Eastern world supply.	1
ClaimBuster	14821				But I would just say this.	0
ClaimBuster	14822				And that's why I'm sure that our brighter days are still ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	14823				She does not have a...	0
ClaimBuster	14824				And then I believe we should indicate our desire to live at peace with the world.	0
ClaimBuster	14825				And it's funny, but it's also really troubling.	0
ClaimBuster	14826				And we're protecting a couple of options in terms of modernizing our strategic forces.	0
ClaimBuster	14827				And I hope we can finally get it in the next session of Congress, because we need it badly.	0
ClaimBuster	14828				It'd be fine with me.	0
ClaimBuster	14829				But I would have no hesitation to ask the American people to pay the taxes even in l961 - if necessary - to maintain a sound economy and also to maintain a sound dollar.	0
ClaimBuster	14830				And I've been proud of their support and their recognition of my service to the veterans.	0
ClaimBuster	14831				The first I've -- who gave it that name?	0
ClaimBuster	14832				I'm not playing Lawrence Welk music tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	14833				And so we've got to reverse this.	0
ClaimBuster	14834				We have a depleted military.	1
ClaimBuster	14835				I will pay down the debt every single year until it is eliminated early in the next decade.	0
ClaimBuster	14836				I've just gotten a report from the Air Force that indicates that the 30-year lifecycle cost of that system is going to be $100 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	14837				I'm worried about overcommitting our military around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	14838				We've got to have a president that can lead on this issue, that can work with the Congress, and I'm prepared to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	14839				Uh - I think the Burger Court has confirmed that basic and very controversial decision of the Warren Court.	1
ClaimBuster	14840				And that's what I did with that vote.	0
ClaimBuster	14841				For me to have made such a statement would been in direct uh - opposition to that treaty.	0
ClaimBuster	14842				But you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently.	1
ClaimBuster	14843				I will be a president for all of our people.	0
ClaimBuster	14844				"They get on me -- Bill's gotten on me about, ""read my lips."""	0
ClaimBuster	14845				Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.	0
ClaimBuster	14846				So in my view, if you want to be protected, you ought to vote for Bob Dole and we'll get the instant check passed and we'll keep guns out of the hands of criminals.	0
ClaimBuster	14847				Well, we've taken the first step.	0
ClaimBuster	14848				We say we will defend it if it's part of a general attack on Formosa.	0
ClaimBuster	14849				Now, Gerald Ford left a five-year projected plan for a military build-up to restore our defenses, and President Carter's administration reduced that by 38%, cut 60 ships out of the Navy building program that had been proposed, and stopped the the B-l, delayed the cruise missile, stopped the production line for the Minuteman missile, stopped the Trident or delayed the Trident submarine, and now is planning a mobile military force that can be delivered to various spots in the world which does make me question his assaults on whether I am the one who is quick to look for use of force.	1
ClaimBuster	14850				And I'm proud to have been a part of an administration that has done exactly that.	0
ClaimBuster	14851				I think the President was correct, certainly, in his decision to continue the flights while the conference was going on.	0
ClaimBuster	14852				I think foreign aid needs to be used to encourage markets and reform.	0
ClaimBuster	14853				But if I look at the facts as a businessman, it's so tilted, the first thing you ought to do is just say, guys, if you like these deals so well, we'll give you the deal you gave us.	0
ClaimBuster	14854				Now, briefly, let me tell you how my prescription drug plan works.	0
ClaimBuster	14855				Well, he raised the question of my father -- it was a good line, well rehearsed and well delivered.	1
ClaimBuster	14856				So he may not be the right person to talk to.	0
ClaimBuster	14857				We have to have our people at work.	0
ClaimBuster	14858				And we used - yes, we used - the Senate Budget Committee's projections for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5% - which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated.	1
ClaimBuster	14859				I'm pleased the president made the decision he made.	0
ClaimBuster	14860				On the broad issue here, when you're trying to solve a problem, you get the best plans.	0
ClaimBuster	14861				And you asked a great question because it's not only seniors.	0
ClaimBuster	14862				I like Meg Whitman, she knows what it's like to be out there in the marketplace.	0
ClaimBuster	14863				I am in favor of tax cuts to encourage and give incentives for the quicker development of these new kinds of technologies.	0
ClaimBuster	14864				That's why I told you about the award he won from the National Journal.	1
ClaimBuster	14865				And that means that our aid that we provide to Pakistan is going to have to be conditioned upon certain benchmarks being met.	0
ClaimBuster	14866				This orgy of spending and enormous deficits you voted for almost all of his budgets.	1
ClaimBuster	14867				And if she ever wins this race, they won't be taken care of.	0
ClaimBuster	14868				Well, Katie (ph), thank you.	0
ClaimBuster	14869				Getting back to personal differences, I think, Jim, if you are a little more specific, but I think the President could clarify one thing tonight and that's the question of pardons.	0
ClaimBuster	14870				But they're not getting the $5,100 the president promised them.	1
ClaimBuster	14871				I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that's fine.	0
ClaimBuster	14872				And our goal in my administration would be to get all of the troops out of there with a minimal amount you need for training and logistics as we do in some other countries in the world after a war to be able to sustain the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	14873				Fixing our training programs for our workers.	0
ClaimBuster	14874				You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said -- he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie.	1
ClaimBuster	14875				He didn't have to, and he did, and we all appreciate it.	1
ClaimBuster	14876				This is going to take first, building a consensus at grassroots America.	0
ClaimBuster	14877				Secondly, I don't think we ought to be selling guns to people who shouldn't have them.	0
ClaimBuster	14878				One of his campaign people alleged that Prime Minister Allawi was like a puppet.	1
ClaimBuster	14879				I could not send soldiers into the north of Iraq, that would have been wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	14880				And the result is, we deployed, and the Soviets kept deploying, and then we negotiated from strength.	1
ClaimBuster	14881				And this -- I love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	14882				And I think I know what he meant by that.	0
ClaimBuster	14883				I'm going to pay for this later on.	0
ClaimBuster	14884				That was something I concurred with...	1
ClaimBuster	14885				President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud.	1
ClaimBuster	14886				The president just talked about Iraq as a center of the war on terror.	1
ClaimBuster	14887				That's the wrong way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	14888				The hemisphere is in our interest to have a peaceful Columbia.	0
ClaimBuster	14889				He's had experience in it.	1
ClaimBuster	14890				It's really true, even the ones that sometimes shake their fists at us.	0
ClaimBuster	14891				So what we have to do is two things.	0
ClaimBuster	14892				But there's a better way to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	14893				I have a long record on that, on a long series of reforms.	1
ClaimBuster	14894				That's the way you bring a deficit down and help to improve the quality of life for people at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	14895				But he has made -- not admitted a mistake and I just find it impossible to understand how an American can demonstrate against his own country in a foreign land -- organizing demonstrations against it when young men are held prisoner in Hanoi or kids out of the ghetto were drafted.	1
ClaimBuster	14896				That's the task of the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	14897				However many days that young girl in Florida stood in her classroom, however long, even if it was only one day, doesn't change the fact that there are a lot of overcrowded classrooms in America and we need to do something about that.	1
ClaimBuster	14898				But it's less than 1 percent of the total cost of health care.	1
ClaimBuster	14899				On drugs, I have repeatedly said drugs are wrong and illegal and can kill you.	1
ClaimBuster	14900				And that's something which will be a priority of ours in the new administration because without it, we cannot have the effective and strong and credible nuclear deterrent we must have.	0
ClaimBuster	14901				I believe we should study this and other allowances; tax expense, dividend expenses and all the rest, and make a determination of how we can stimulate growth; how we can provide the revenues needed to move our country forward.	0
ClaimBuster	14902				But Fannie and Freddie were the catalysts, the match that started this forest fire.	0
ClaimBuster	14903				Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago?	0
ClaimBuster	14904				But beyond that we need to address the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	14905				Daniel, I don't support a draft.	0
ClaimBuster	14906				Now, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad.	1
ClaimBuster	14907				I think marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman.	0
ClaimBuster	14908				And I don't agree with it.	0
ClaimBuster	14909				I said I would have the Secretary of Defense sit down.	1
ClaimBuster	14910				Iran has Iraq as one of its neighbors.	1
ClaimBuster	14911				Well, he does , he has a little bit, and I hope he will continue.	0
ClaimBuster	14912				Also I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments, and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education, and health care.	0
ClaimBuster	14913				I want to build on that.	0
ClaimBuster	14914				"He attacked the woman reporter writing the story, called her ""disgusting,"" as he has called a number of women during this campaign."	1
ClaimBuster	14915				We are better off than we were four years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	14916				If that's the case, then it will always be the best product that people can purchase.	0
ClaimBuster	14917				Well, all that I can suggest is that all the experts who have studied the program indicate that it is the most fantastic program, the worst program, insofar as its effect on the farmers, that the - America has ever had foisted upon it in an election year or any other time.	1
ClaimBuster	14918				I don't force you to do anything.	0
ClaimBuster	14919				And I think that's the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer.	0
ClaimBuster	14920				We're going the make great deals.	0
ClaimBuster	14921				We've been there a long time, and we've got to make sure that we and our coalition partners are pulling out responsibly and giving Afghans the capabilities that they need.	0
ClaimBuster	14922				He doesn't fix it for ten years.	1
ClaimBuster	14923				There is $2.3 trillion of surplus that we can use to make sure that younger workers have a Social Security plan in the future.	1
ClaimBuster	14924				We're going to make America safe again.	0
ClaimBuster	14925				And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.	1
ClaimBuster	14926				Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won't take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario.	1
ClaimBuster	14927				That, however, is not my only passion.	0
ClaimBuster	14928				There have been only six cases brought by this Attorney General under the voting bill passed in 1957 and the voting bill passed in 1960.	1
ClaimBuster	14929				And that's to be honored.	0
ClaimBuster	14930				Let me just give you one tiny example.	0
ClaimBuster	14931				I want a top down review to determine what our priorities are and what we should do in defense, and then follow that policy instead of this bottom up review with all the services fighting for the money.	0
ClaimBuster	14932				And that's what we're doing.	1
ClaimBuster	14933				We expect there to be standards met and we expect there to be measurement.	0
ClaimBuster	14934				She and her son Bryan, they came to see me.	1
ClaimBuster	14935				It means looking (ph) at the spending side, but also at the revenue side.	0
ClaimBuster	14936				But Washington is a tough town.	0
ClaimBuster	14937				"I mean, ""compassionate conservative,"" what does that mean?"	0
ClaimBuster	14938				But more importantly, with respect to the question of no record, I helped write -- I did write, I was one of the original authors of the early childhood health care and the expansion of health care that we did in the middle of the 1990s.	1
ClaimBuster	14939				But I'm all for NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	14940				And God bless them, every one of them decided on their own to come here this evening.	1
ClaimBuster	14941				And if they are, fine.	0
ClaimBuster	14942				Let me say this to you, I wouldn't use force.	0
ClaimBuster	14943				Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share.	1
ClaimBuster	14944				And that's not going to happen by just hiring teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	14945				I will fight tooth and nail to pass the minimum wage.	0
ClaimBuster	14946				So when you bring those rates down, those small businesses are able to keep more money and hire more people.	1
ClaimBuster	14947				But that's Senate inside baseball.	0
ClaimBuster	14948				I can tell him some I'm against.	0
ClaimBuster	14949				He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen.	1
ClaimBuster	14950				It shouldn't be politicized in any way by the President or by his opponent.	0
ClaimBuster	14951				"The truth of that matter is, if you listen carefully, Saddam would still be in power if he were the president of the United States, ""And the world would be a lot better off."""	0
ClaimBuster	14952				In a little school everybody is somebody; individualism is very important.	0
ClaimBuster	14953				But let's come back to something the president and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it's more affordable for families.	0
ClaimBuster	14954				I am not parsing words.	0
ClaimBuster	14955				Obamacare was the first step.	0
ClaimBuster	14956				Well, his campaign manager, who used to be the secretary of the treasury, was taking great credit about a year ago and asking and receiving from the Congress substantial additional funds to hire internal revenue agents to go out and collect these funds, and I'm happy to join Jim Baker in saying that we agree on this.	1
ClaimBuster	14957				That's why, in my plan, I add two active duty divisions to the United States Army, not for Iraq, but for our general demands across the globe.	0
ClaimBuster	14958				It was a big, big mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	14959				94% comes from the local level.	1
ClaimBuster	14960				She negotiated with the oil companies and faced them down, a $40 billion pipeline of natural gas that's going to relieve the energy needs of the United -- of what they call the lower 48.	1
ClaimBuster	14961				And this strategy, and this general, they are winning.	0
ClaimBuster	14962				We need to deny them the safe havens.	0
ClaimBuster	14963				Unfortunately, the economy is not stronger.	0
ClaimBuster	14964				But it was a terrible recession.	0
ClaimBuster	14965				Since I've been in office, we've had a steady, carefully planned, methodical but, very effective increase in our commitment for defense.	1
ClaimBuster	14966				The Arab countries have a stake in not having a civil war.	0
ClaimBuster	14967				You know, we have 17,000 men and women today wearing our uniform that receive food stamps.	1
ClaimBuster	14968				And, by the way, Senator Obama has never mentioned how much that fine might be.	1
ClaimBuster	14969				I don't say the Democrats are united in their support of the program.	0
ClaimBuster	14970				And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information.	1
ClaimBuster	14971				It would've called for export controls on agricultural products In my judgment the best way to get jobs is to uh - expand the private sector, where five out of six jobs today exist in our economy.	1
ClaimBuster	14972				Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.	1
ClaimBuster	14973				Why the deficits are so much of a problem for him now, but that in 1976, when the deficit was $52 billion and everyone was panicking about that, he said, no, that he thought it ought to be bigger, because a bigger deficit would stimulate the economy and would help do away with unemployment.	1
ClaimBuster	14974				I want to change many of its provisions.	0
ClaimBuster	14975				And for the last eight years I've served on the National Security Council.	1
ClaimBuster	14976				I want, Joe, you to do the job.	0
ClaimBuster	14977				Now, leaders will always make mistakes.	0
ClaimBuster	14978				In Iraq, we'll be having free elections, and a free society will make this world more peaceful.	0
ClaimBuster	14979				I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don't get in the hands of people that shouldn't have them.	0
ClaimBuster	14980				Let's don't -- you don't have to believe it.	0
ClaimBuster	14981				And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck.	0
ClaimBuster	14982				He has gradually repressed most of the liberties that we would expect for nations to observe, and he has exhibited most aggressive behavior, obviously, in Georgia.	0
ClaimBuster	14983				Now, my problem is -- I heard what he said.	0
ClaimBuster	14984				Yes, we shouldn't trade arms for hostages.	0
ClaimBuster	14985				What message does that send to our allies?	0
ClaimBuster	14986				And the consequence is that federal portion or federal money will go to the parent, so the parent can go to a tutoring program or another public school or another private school.	1
ClaimBuster	14987				You know, I think the American people deserve credit for the great economy that we have.	0
ClaimBuster	14988				I wish I knew the law because I would darn sure sign it.	0
ClaimBuster	14989				Some of them I voted for.	1
ClaimBuster	14990				And when I roll it back and we invest in the things that I have talked about to move our economy, we're going to grow sufficiently, it would begin to cut the deficit in half, and we get back to where we were at the end of the 1990s when we balanced the budget and paid down the debt of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	14991				(chuckle) Well, in the first place, I'm not criticizing His Holiness the Pope.	0
ClaimBuster	14992				meeting a condemnation of Russian infiltration of Cuba.	0
ClaimBuster	14993				This Thursday night on ABC from 8:30 to 9, Friday night on NBC from 8 to 8:30, and Saturday night on CBS from 8 to 8:30, we'll be down in the trenches under the hood working on fixin' the old car to get it back on the road.	0
ClaimBuster	14994				That is the obligation upon our generation.	0
ClaimBuster	14995				And for those of you working, thanks from the bottom of my heart.	0
ClaimBuster	14996				I know how to make that happen.	0
ClaimBuster	14997				But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.	0
ClaimBuster	14998				The President says he wants to eliminate or reduce the number of nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	14999				Trying to find my light.	0
ClaimBuster	15000				And she could have done this years ago, by the way.	0
ClaimBuster	15001				All she's done is talk to the African-Americans and to the Latinos, but they get the vote, and then they come back, they say, we'll see you in four years.	0
ClaimBuster	15002				And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall.	1
ClaimBuster	15003				I have been in politics for some time, and I worry about the people who don't vote.	0
ClaimBuster	15004				I think when you make that decision, it might be well if you would ask yourself, are you better off than you were four years ago?	0
ClaimBuster	15005				So I want to proceed carefully to cover more people.	0
ClaimBuster	15006				Our bill was far more effective.	0
ClaimBuster	15007				Who are we to say, well, under certain circumstances, it's all right, but under other circumstances it isn't?	0
ClaimBuster	15008				Well, I believe that conservation, at course, is worthy in and of itself.	0
ClaimBuster	15009				And indeed, every time it has increased you will find there is an increase in minority unemployment among young people.	1
ClaimBuster	15010				This was not a way to pay down the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	15011				It is so sad when you see what's happened.	0
ClaimBuster	15012				I know this, 100% will get it if I'm the president.	0
ClaimBuster	15013				To say that we are limited, and at a dangerous point in this country with regard to energy, I think, is to ignore the fact.	0
ClaimBuster	15014				Let's limit some of these guys sitting out here tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	15015				I don't use language like that and I don't think that we should.	0
ClaimBuster	15016				He stood on principle standing up to the Soviet Union, and we won that conflict.	1
ClaimBuster	15017				So I'll let the American people decide, judge, who's going to be more effective and more credible when it comes to imposing crippling sanctions.	0
ClaimBuster	15018				In policies that will lift wages and will grow our middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	15019				And the $650 isn't even on that.	0
ClaimBuster	15020				I was chairman of it once.	1
ClaimBuster	15021				It's not a lot of money relative to what I had.	0
ClaimBuster	15022				We'll have specific differences later.	0
ClaimBuster	15023				When they raise your taxes nobody runs around asking people where are you going to get the extra money.	0
ClaimBuster	15024				And Senator Obama, by saying that he would attack Pakistan, look at the context of his words.	0
ClaimBuster	15025				It's God's will, it'll happen.	0
ClaimBuster	15026				And I don't believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care of not.	0
ClaimBuster	15027				I'll tell you another way to help protect America in the long run is to continue with missile defenses.	0
ClaimBuster	15028				I -- I was -- I was someone who ran businesses for 25 years, and balanced the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	15029				We need to reach out to moderate Arab nations as well to build coalitions to keep the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	15030				So here's what I've done since I've been president.	0
ClaimBuster	15031				So far, Mr. Ford has not done it.	1
ClaimBuster	15032				I've tried to use the White House as a bully pulpit, speaking out against discrimination.	0
ClaimBuster	15033				It's really a matter of culture.	0
ClaimBuster	15034				In the last four months alone, five hundred thousand Americans have gone on the unemployment roll.	1
ClaimBuster	15035				But you have to work together.	0
ClaimBuster	15036				And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide.	0
ClaimBuster	15037				We've achieved an arms control agreement that our critics thought was never possible and I want to build on it.	1
ClaimBuster	15038				And in his tax plan, you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out.	1
ClaimBuster	15039				Once you have that understanding and mutual respect, then we can transcend the differences and embrace the highest common denominator of the American spirit.	0
ClaimBuster	15040				I think we all recall with some sadness that at uh - the period of the nin- late nineteen forties, early nineteen fifties, there were some indications that the United States would not include uh - South Korea in an area of defense.	0
ClaimBuster	15041				Keep my promises to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	15042				As far as health care is concerned, obviously, everyone is struggling to make sure that they can afford their premiums and that they can have affordable and available health care.	0
ClaimBuster	15043				But they've got to have a strong basic economy and if you're in debt, it's like having a ball and chain around you.	0
ClaimBuster	15044				We all understand what this country has become because talent from all around the world wants to come here.	0
ClaimBuster	15045				He's praised George Bush as a good economic steward and Dick Cheney as somebody who's -- who shows great wisdom and judgment.	1
ClaimBuster	15046				And that's why I'll be a better commander in chief.	0
ClaimBuster	15047				When you talk to those bankers, did they discuss where interest rates were when your party controlled the White House?	0
ClaimBuster	15048				One's in technical school, one's an honor student in high school.	1
ClaimBuster	15049				We have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	15050				And, finally, we've got to go out there and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren't being paid to this country.	1
ClaimBuster	15051				He's arranged for me to spend a lot more time with Senator D'Amato in the last couple years so I'm more familiar with his comments than I used to be.	1
ClaimBuster	15052				This attitude is extremely dangerous and belligerent in its tone, although it's said with a quiet voice.	0
ClaimBuster	15053				If the president's energy policies are working, you're going to see the cost of energy come down.	1
ClaimBuster	15054				Will he join me in suggesting that we may need another plant?	0
ClaimBuster	15055				And that is what I call a flexible freeze that allows growth about 4 percent or the rate of inflation but does not permit the Congress just to add on spending.	0
ClaimBuster	15056				But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts?	0
ClaimBuster	15057				Take a look at the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	15058				Now, we have to take measured steps because the sentiment within Serbia is, for understandable reasons, against the United States because their nationalism -- even if they don't like Milosevic, they still have some feelings lingering from the NATO action there.	0
ClaimBuster	15059				And for every dollar that I spend in those two categories, I'll put $2 toward paying down the national debt.	0
ClaimBuster	15060				We have to have all of the above, alternative fuels, wind, tide, solar, natural gas, clean coal technology.	0
ClaimBuster	15061				I've learned to feed myself and to walk and to dress.	1
ClaimBuster	15062				And we've got to begin early, in the first, second and third grade, before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very, very dangerous substances.	0
ClaimBuster	15063				I have seen four wars in my lifetime.	1
ClaimBuster	15064				He has surrounded himself with former KGB apparatchiks.	1
ClaimBuster	15065				Now, as to why I should be and he shouldn't be, when he was a candidate in 1976, President Carter invented a thing he called the misery index.	1
ClaimBuster	15066				I know what it means to see people who are unemployed.	0
ClaimBuster	15067				That's an interruption, by the way.	1
ClaimBuster	15068				But character is an important part of the equation.	0
ClaimBuster	15069				The point is that as we look at this nation's future, and we have two very different visions of this future.	0
ClaimBuster	15070				Well, I said a few minutes ago, Peter, that you could improve the lives of families and youngsters and save money at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	15071				It's a record they think they can play that everybody loves to hear.	0
ClaimBuster	15072				He not only advocates the scrapping of this treaty - and I don't know that these men that he quotes are against the treaty in its final form - but he also advocates the possibility, he said it's been a missing element, of playing a trump card against the Soviet Union of a nuclear arms race, and is insisting upon nuclear superiority by our own nation, as a predication for negotiation in the future with the Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	15073				We are spending that surplus to make the deficit look smaller to you than it really is.	1
ClaimBuster	15074				And of course, what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut Social Security benefits by 25 percent -- reducing the adjustment for inflation, cutting out minimum benefits for the poorest on Social Security, removing educational benefits for dependents whose widows were trying -- with widows trying to get them through college.	1
ClaimBuster	15075				But there was fortunately others beside myself who believed that we ought to take action.	0
ClaimBuster	15076				And that's why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I've spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families.	1
ClaimBuster	15077				I would hope an incident like that would not happen.	0
ClaimBuster	15078				I appreciate the quote from the young man.	0
ClaimBuster	15079				What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	15080				But on all of these things, a sound economy is the only way to get it going.	0
ClaimBuster	15081				We need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition.	0
ClaimBuster	15082				And when those rich corporations don't pay that tax, the average American taxpayer pays it for 'em.	0
ClaimBuster	15083				And I don't think it's uh - the Congress is Mr. Ford's opponent; but if uh - if - if he insists that uh - that I be responsible for the Democratic Congress, of which I'm - have not been a part, then I think it's only fair that he be responsible for the Nixon administration in its entirety, of which he was a part.	1
ClaimBuster	15084				But to indicate in advance how we would respond, to indicate the nature of this response would be incorrect; it would certainly be inappropriate; it would not be in the best interests of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	15085				They also have cut two billion dollars off of defense.	1
ClaimBuster	15086				See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.	0
ClaimBuster	15087				And then, Helen, I really believe where people are going to ask this question about trust, because I do think there's a pattern by Governor Clinton of saying one thing to please one group, and then trying to please another group.	1
ClaimBuster	15088				It's the law-abiding citizens who will do that.	0
ClaimBuster	15089				I'll be glad to answer any question you have, but this election ought to be about the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	15090				Defense industries are going to have to convert to civilian industries.	0
ClaimBuster	15091				I know a lot of them that aren't working.	1
ClaimBuster	15092				Now, we can do that.	0
ClaimBuster	15093				We can't simply be focused on Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	15094				I noticed also in The Wall Street Journal early this week, that a preliminary report of his task force advocates making Social Security more sound by reducing the adjustment in Social Security for the retired people to compensate for the impact of inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	15095				Number one, we are going to have North American energy independence.	0
ClaimBuster	15096				I want to see peace.	0
ClaimBuster	15097				It's time for America to find new leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	15098				Now, Governor Romney will say he's got an all-of-the-above plan, but basically his plan is to let the oil companies write the energy policies.	1
ClaimBuster	15099				And what I don't like is trickle down government.	0
ClaimBuster	15100				And when I'm president, I will.	0
ClaimBuster	15101				But I want to give every American family a $5,000 refundable tax credit.	0
ClaimBuster	15102				And I intend to win it as President of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	15103				But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well.	0
ClaimBuster	15104				And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	15105				He must stand for the values of decency that the American people stand for, and he must use the power of the White House to try to control these nuclear weapons and lead this world toward a safer world.	0
ClaimBuster	15106				The inflation rate under Kennedy and Johnson was about 2 percent - one-third what it is under this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	15107				Now, I don't think that's a bad idea.	0
ClaimBuster	15108				First let me just say one comment about what the vice president said.	0
ClaimBuster	15109				You've done a great job.	0
ClaimBuster	15110				Now, the last thing I think we have to focus on is a little bit of history, just so that we understand what we're doing going forward.	0
ClaimBuster	15111				It's a black church just outside of Washington, DC.	1
ClaimBuster	15112				It was part of our other economic plan.	1
ClaimBuster	15113				And, lastly, not to deal with the PLO until and unless the PLO recognizes Israel's right to exist and recognizes UN Resolution 242 as a basis for Middle East peace.	0
ClaimBuster	15114				And he's been proposing all kinds of programs for new spending costing billions.	1
ClaimBuster	15115				Nine million people lost their jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	15116				I think that we have a long way to go, regrettably.	0
ClaimBuster	15117				And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started.	1
ClaimBuster	15118				And when she said irredeemable, they're irredeemable, you didn't mention that, but when she said they're irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse.	0
ClaimBuster	15119				But to state my view precisely, the president should have a variety of things he could do.	0
ClaimBuster	15120				One of his big ideas when it comes to corporate tax reform would be to say, if you invest overseas, you make profits overseas, you don't have to pay U.S. taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	15121				But it does seem to me that you've raised a very important point that needs to be addressed.	0
ClaimBuster	15122				And I mean investing in education, health care, the environment, and middle-class tax cuts and retirement security.	0
ClaimBuster	15123				If we fail then, if we're unable to come to an agreement - and I hope we can come to an agreement because it does not merely involve now the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union as atomic powers.	0
ClaimBuster	15124				In the nature of a campaign, it seems that some campaigns are focused on attacking a person rather than prescribing their own future and the things they'd like to do.	0
ClaimBuster	15125				One, get us energy independent, North American energy independent.	0
ClaimBuster	15126				And the world needs a strong America, and it is stronger now than when I came into office.	0
ClaimBuster	15127				It was due to go bankrupt in 1999 and that 50 million figure again, the newspapers -- I said -- you said forget the journalists, but they are the keepers of the score card and whether or not you're using facts that aren't right.	1
ClaimBuster	15128				Let me pay a compliment to the president, if I may.	0
ClaimBuster	15129				Mr. Bush wants to spend billions and trillions on Star Wars.	0
ClaimBuster	15130				I have supported the Administration's position and I think that that position has been correct; I think my position has been correct.	0
ClaimBuster	15131				But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.	0
ClaimBuster	15132				An administration which wants to billions on weapons systems that we don't need and can't afford, and now confronts us with a very serious problem, and plants that are supposed to be producing tritium and plutonium and providing the necessary materials for existing weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	15133				We can create jobs that pay more than the jobs we're losing overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	15134				I regret what's happened in these past months.	0
ClaimBuster	15135				And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away.	0
ClaimBuster	15136				And the fact is, while we were coordinating an international coalition to make sure these sanctions were effective, you were still invested in a Chinese state oil company that was doing business with the Iranian oil sector.	1
ClaimBuster	15137				I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time.	1
ClaimBuster	15138				My father was a senator who strongly opposed the Vietnam War.	1
ClaimBuster	15139				The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth.	1
ClaimBuster	15140				And if you want a tough President who uses that strength to get arms control and draws the line in the heavens, vote for Walter Mondale.	0
ClaimBuster	15141				And it's great to be with you again.	0
ClaimBuster	15142				And then all the liberal columnists join in.	0
ClaimBuster	15143				This is a -- this is a tax in and of itself.	0
ClaimBuster	15144				Instead of listening to him, they retired him.	1
ClaimBuster	15145				It's a $1 million loan.	1
ClaimBuster	15146				We also need to continue to index Social Security payments, so that if inflation rises, the Social Security payments would rise a commensurate degree to let the buying power of a Social Security check continue intact.	0
ClaimBuster	15147				It was fortunately stopped in its tracks.	1
ClaimBuster	15148				We will continue to stay on the offense.	0
ClaimBuster	15149				I invite the American people tomorrow -- because I will issue the statement quoting President Reagan -- he said exactly what I said he said.	0
ClaimBuster	15150				We organized the Friends of Syria.	1
ClaimBuster	15151				Well I -- I absolutely believe that America has a -- a responsibility, and the privilege of helping defend freedom and promote the principles that -- that make the world more peaceful.	0
ClaimBuster	15152				I mentioned health care earlier.	1
ClaimBuster	15153				And we're on the hunt for him.	1
ClaimBuster	15154				There's only one of us on this stage who's actually shipped jobs to Mexico, because that's Donald.	1
ClaimBuster	15155				But I think our hold uh - of support among those who uh - are crucial to the election has been fairly steady.	0
ClaimBuster	15156				And I believe that is the way you get the deficit down, not by the tax-and-spend program that we hear every 4 years, whether it's Mondale, Dukakis, whoever else it is.	0
ClaimBuster	15157				I'd just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get.	0
ClaimBuster	15158				But I think it was a terrible thing to say.	0
ClaimBuster	15159				I'm a son of Detroit.	1
ClaimBuster	15160				So here's what I would do.	0
ClaimBuster	15161				They interviewed all of my children's friends from childhood on.	1
ClaimBuster	15162				And maybe you need somebody up there who understands when you're getting your pocket picked.	0
ClaimBuster	15163				But I do believe that we ought to talk plainly to the Hollywood moguls and people who produce this stuff and explain the consequences.	0
ClaimBuster	15164				Let me also say, we're having an election today.	1
ClaimBuster	15165				I want to address my remarks to the young people of America, because they're the ones that are going to spend most of their life in the 21st Century.	1
ClaimBuster	15166				If you're middle income, you're about where you were.	0
ClaimBuster	15167				Well, like everyone else, I've spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw.	0
ClaimBuster	15168				If Missouri, just given the number of people from Missouri who are in the military over there today, were a country, it would be the third largest country in the coalition, behind Great Britain and the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	15169				And very little of what Governor Romney just said is true.	0
ClaimBuster	15170				We cannot be the policeman for the world any longer.	0
ClaimBuster	15171				The average South Korean is three inches taller than the average North Korean, a huge gulag.	1
ClaimBuster	15172				I voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly, because I think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control and it is on that vote that th- Mr. Nixon and I disagreed, and his tie vote uh - defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	15173				And we will do it with the highest moral principles.	0
ClaimBuster	15174				I would be interested to see if he would say this evening he'll put Medicare in a lockbox.	0
ClaimBuster	15175				We've got, I think -- you know, you think about women in government, I think about women in business.	0
ClaimBuster	15176				The United States has kept the peace -- the United States has kept the peace through our alliances.	1
ClaimBuster	15177				And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this.	0
ClaimBuster	15178				We have to be competitive if we're going to create more jobs here.	0
ClaimBuster	15179				I agree: Education is key, particularly the future of our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	15180				You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess.	0
ClaimBuster	15181				Create more jobs and opportunities for people on and off welfare.	0
ClaimBuster	15182				And we are going to continue to keep the pressure on to make sure that they do not get a nuclear weapon.	0
ClaimBuster	15183				And let the world know - that's very important.	0
ClaimBuster	15184				But I would like to shift, if I could, to the big issue of education.	0
ClaimBuster	15185				Hey, I've got to answer that, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	15186				It's just the right position to take.	0
ClaimBuster	15187				But when you keep star-warring it -- I never suggested where the weapons should be or what kind; I'm not a scientist.	1
ClaimBuster	15188				But -- but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I'll release my returns.	0
ClaimBuster	15189				We're going to have to do some things that are quite costly.	0
ClaimBuster	15190				These are a few of the things to which our nation is committed, and we will continue with these commitments.	0
ClaimBuster	15191				But I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	15192				So that's how I've used my travels, when I travel to Israel and when I travel to the region.	1
ClaimBuster	15193				It is such a great question and it's maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense.	0
ClaimBuster	15194				You can't add billions of dollars to our expenditures and not pay for it.	0
ClaimBuster	15195				I think the administration did the right thing in that case.	0
ClaimBuster	15196				We believe that we had also promised that we would make our country more secure.	0
ClaimBuster	15197				That's why I strongly supported the Motor Voter law.	1
ClaimBuster	15198				And what's that going to do?	0
ClaimBuster	15199				The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity, as I've said, and that has not been changed.	0
ClaimBuster	15200				So here's what we have to do comprehensively, though.	0
ClaimBuster	15201				And yet, his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation, because in January, at the beginning of the year, it was more than 18%.	1
ClaimBuster	15202				And so we need military strength, we need economic strength, we also need the right diplomatic policies.	0
ClaimBuster	15203				Now, Senator Obama without precondition wants to sit down and negotiate with them, without preconditions.	0
ClaimBuster	15204				And judgment is what we look for in the president of the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	15205				So I think people are going to be looking for trust and experience.	0
ClaimBuster	15206				Let's talk about programs for children.	0
ClaimBuster	15207				I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything.	0
ClaimBuster	15208				We have seen on Capitol Hill, in the Congress, uh - a great many uh - allegations of wrong-doing, of uh - alleged immorality, uh - those are very disturbing to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	15209				Whether it be opposition to spending and earmarks, whether it be the issue of torture, whether it be the conduct of the war in Iraq, which I vigorously opposed.	1
ClaimBuster	15210				I have believed that in the appointment of judges that all that was specified in the party platform was that they respect the sanctity of human life.	0
ClaimBuster	15211				And, as well, we're pursuing a strategy of freedom around the world, because I understand free nations will reject terror.	0
ClaimBuster	15212				Now lastly, I believe in the case of Little Rock.	0
ClaimBuster	15213				And if it is, I appreciate it congratulate you.	0
ClaimBuster	15214				Every free economy has good regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	15215				We've had an increase in taxes paid by individuals, payroll taxes, from14 Percent up to 20 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	15216				If -- if we're serious, we've got to take a balanced, responsible approach.	0
ClaimBuster	15217				Now, isn't it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child, and it was abortion and not murder, but if somebody else does it, that's murder?	0
ClaimBuster	15218				You know, it's so easy now to say, hey, cut out foreign aid, we got a problem at home.	0
ClaimBuster	15219				They hit middle- and moderate-income Americans and leave wealthy Americans largely untouched.	1
ClaimBuster	15220				Now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down.	1
ClaimBuster	15221				So our troops will come home at that point.	1
ClaimBuster	15222				If you notice that in all of this proposal, Senator -- government wants -- Senator Obama wants government to do the job.	1
ClaimBuster	15223				You know he calls it an outsourcing to keep -- stop outsourcing.	0
ClaimBuster	15224				That's where the problem is and I hope there'll be some corrective action taken so we can get some new leadership in the Congress of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	15225				But I couldn't completely neglect the beauty around me -- the Pacific out there on one side of the highway, shining in the sunlight, the mountains of the coast range rising on the other side.	0
ClaimBuster	15226				We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow, whether because of age or need.	0
ClaimBuster	15227				But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas.	0
ClaimBuster	15228				And the way to defeat them long-term, by the way, is to spread freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	15229				That's by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced.	0
ClaimBuster	15230				Whereas I have proposed we ought to take.	0
ClaimBuster	15231				And I don't want to see the banks let off the hook.	0
ClaimBuster	15232				If I couldn't cut taxes and balance the budget the same time, I wouldn't look at you in the eye in your living room or wherever you might be and say that this is good for America.	0
ClaimBuster	15233				And here's my tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	15234				It's a matter of morality.	0
ClaimBuster	15235				And then somehow you're also going to deal with the deficit that we've already got.	0
ClaimBuster	15236				They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents.	0
ClaimBuster	15237				And that means, for example, standing up for human rights.	0
ClaimBuster	15238				Give me a chance to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	15239				It's a very sacred contract, and I believe in it.	0
ClaimBuster	15240				That's why I fight to clean up the environment and protect this earth.	0
ClaimBuster	15241				I'm sure that you appreciate that.	0
ClaimBuster	15242				And the schools that are not chosen are improved -- competition does that.	0
ClaimBuster	15243				And I miss going to church, but I think the Lord understands.	0
ClaimBuster	15244				I understand that I can get this country on track again.	0
ClaimBuster	15245				And the last thing I wanna make is this.	0
ClaimBuster	15246				I've seen the family values of all these people in America who are out there killing themselves working harder for less in a country that's had the worst economic years in 50 years and the first decline in industrial production ever.	1
ClaimBuster	15247				But when it came time to making sure that Gadhafi did not stay in power, that he was captured, Governor, your suggestion was that this was mission creep, that this was mission muddle.	1
ClaimBuster	15248				I think we ought to be forgiving Third World debt under certain conditions.	0
ClaimBuster	15249				So I'm satisfied with it.	0
ClaimBuster	15250				He doesn't understand that Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia.	1
ClaimBuster	15251				I was on the world of business for 25 years.	1
ClaimBuster	15252				I've been saying that for over a year now.	1
ClaimBuster	15253				The vice president thinks it's the government's money.	0
ClaimBuster	15254				But the key thing is to make sure you can get a job when you get out of school.	0
ClaimBuster	15255				And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns.	1
ClaimBuster	15256				I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates.	0
ClaimBuster	15257				The Soviet Union knows what they want in detente, and they've been getting it.	0
ClaimBuster	15258				Now also, with regard to the figures about California.	0
ClaimBuster	15259				This is particularly true of the recent efforts to shut down part of Alaska.	1
ClaimBuster	15260				And I don't intend to politicize it.	0
ClaimBuster	15261				I support charter schools and pay for performance for teachers.	1
ClaimBuster	15262				I don't believe it does.	0
ClaimBuster	15263				I will bring fresh credibility, a new start, and we will get the job done right.	0
ClaimBuster	15264				All of us ought to be involved with programs that provide a viable alternative to abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	15265				Mr. Vice President, thank you very much, and I would like to thank the folks here at Wake Forest, and I want to thank you all for listening.	0
ClaimBuster	15266				Instead we had, I think, in the second quarter, a Consumer Price Index registering around 12%.	1
ClaimBuster	15267				If we build up the hopes of the world by having a summit conference that is not adequately prepared, and then, if Mr. Khrushchev finds some excuse for breaking it up - as he did this one - because he isn't going to get his way - we'd set back the cause of peace.	0
ClaimBuster	15268				I do know what affirmative action means.	0
ClaimBuster	15269				I think the foremost (Applause)	0
ClaimBuster	15270				The only thing we're going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you.	0
ClaimBuster	15271				They don't let me get away with anything.	0
ClaimBuster	15272				We differ on the kinds of appointments that we would make.	0
ClaimBuster	15273				And I've had a consistent record ever since 1965.	1
ClaimBuster	15274				Former Governor Racicot, as chairman of the Republican Party, said he thought that the Patriot Act has to be changed and fixed.	1
ClaimBuster	15275				Now I don't know what Senator Kennedy suggests when he says that we should help those who oppose the Castro regime, both in Cuba and without.	0
ClaimBuster	15276				Let's put health records online, that will reduce medical errors, as they call them.	0
ClaimBuster	15277				Then year after year for decades, they will have jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	15278				We are the sole remaining superpower, and we should be that.	0
ClaimBuster	15279				I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.	1
ClaimBuster	15280				Now, I won't mention their names, because they're rich, but they're not famous.	1
ClaimBuster	15281				It's well-known that I have not been elected Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate nor with the administration.	1
ClaimBuster	15282				The president says that I'm denigrating these troops.	1
ClaimBuster	15283				The plan says there will be elections in January, and there will be.	1
ClaimBuster	15284				Well, thank you for asking your question.	0
ClaimBuster	15285				The president needed the authority to use force in order to be able to get him to do something, because he never did it without the threat of force.	1
ClaimBuster	15286				We still have the strictest air control, or air pollution laws in the country.	1
ClaimBuster	15287				That, to me, was so hurtful.	0
ClaimBuster	15288				Every Republican on the Rules Committee voted against sending that bill to be considered by the members of the House of Representatives.	1
ClaimBuster	15289				I believe that the way in which I will approach the Presidency is what's needed, because all my life that has been the way in which I have sought to lead.	0
ClaimBuster	15290				We've got to help them.	0
ClaimBuster	15291				You've got to show you're serious in that regard.	0
ClaimBuster	15292				And by two to one, Congress is blamed for these deficits.	1
ClaimBuster	15293				I didn't question the man's patriotism.	0
ClaimBuster	15294				We're going to do that with a more aggressive trade policy.	0
ClaimBuster	15295				It was $200 billion deficit instead.	1
ClaimBuster	15296				He said that by now middle-income families would have a reduction in their health insurance premiums by $2,500 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	15297				Senator Hagel of Nebraska said that the handling of Iraq is beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing; it's in the zone of dangerous.	1
ClaimBuster	15298				I broke with my party in order to balance the budget, and Ronald Reagan signed into law the tax cut that we voted for.	1
ClaimBuster	15299				So, yeah, I think -- I do think it's time.	0
ClaimBuster	15300				Small business--you've got to have capital, you've got to credit, and many of them need mentors or coaches.	0
ClaimBuster	15301				Well, the United States uh - has on occasion attempted uh - mostly in the middle fifties, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to pull his troops back to Formosa.	1
ClaimBuster	15302				It would be a game-changer in the region.	0
ClaimBuster	15303				This is a very serious problem in our country, and it has to be dealt with.	0
ClaimBuster	15304				And I believe the answer to the agricultural economy is not to get the government further involved, but to do what I'm suggesting.	0
ClaimBuster	15305				We were proud of them.	0
ClaimBuster	15306				I can say this: I do not believe Yassir Arafat wants us to send troops to the West Bank.	0
ClaimBuster	15307				You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails?	0
ClaimBuster	15308				Well, I've listened to both sides, and if they would talk to one another instead of throwing rocks, I think we could get a lot done.	0
ClaimBuster	15309				Senator Obama's secret that you don't know is that his tax increases will increase taxes on 50 percent of small business revenue.	1
ClaimBuster	15310				And as a result, our nation paid a price.	0
ClaimBuster	15311				You were offered a chance to join.	1
ClaimBuster	15312				I'm from a big farm state.	1
ClaimBuster	15313				We have a concept called the New American School Corporation where we're doing exactly that.	1
ClaimBuster	15314				So these are the combination of things I want, and the fact that I don't think the federal government can endorse a $35 billion program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program.	0
ClaimBuster	15315				I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden.	1
ClaimBuster	15316				But it's extremely difficult to make that judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	15317				Secondly, the Vice President mentioned medical care for the aged.	1
ClaimBuster	15318				I'm asking for your vote.	0
ClaimBuster	15319				What I would do is to bring in the pension experts of the country, take a look at it, and strengthen the pension requirements further, because it's not just enough to have the guarantee.	0
ClaimBuster	15320				I want to control our own energy by developing oil and natural gas but also the energy sources of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	15321				Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.	0
ClaimBuster	15322				And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.	0
ClaimBuster	15323				You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund.	1
ClaimBuster	15324				I've been involved, as I mentioned to you before, in virtually every major national security challenge we've faced in the last 20-some years.	1
ClaimBuster	15325				I don't know where that money would come from.	0
ClaimBuster	15326				And I've seen at first hand, in a very vivid way, the deep hurt that's come to this country in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia, Chile, and Pakistan, and Angola, and Watergate, CIA revelations.	0
ClaimBuster	15327				And I said, what can we do about it.	0
ClaimBuster	15328				You're not going to find a quote from me.	0
ClaimBuster	15329				And they've also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it's not me.	0
ClaimBuster	15330				Osama bin Laden doesn't get to decide.	0
ClaimBuster	15331				I'm concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	15332				We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.	0
ClaimBuster	15333				I'm sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality.	0
ClaimBuster	15334				And therefore, the President's judgment has been that we should defend the islands if, in his military judgment and the judgment of the commander in the field, the attack on these islands should be part of an overall attack on Formosa.	1
ClaimBuster	15335				They write me, and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix.	1
ClaimBuster	15336				The Miranda case, uh - the Burger Court uh - is gradually changing, and I'm pleased to see that there are some steps being made by the uh - Burger Court to modify the so-called Miranda decision.	1
ClaimBuster	15337				One bank in uh - Washington, fo- for instance, gives lower interest loans for people who adequately insulate their homes or who buy efficient automobiles.	1
ClaimBuster	15338				Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses.	1
ClaimBuster	15339				That's why the National Federation of Independent Businesses said your plan will kill 700,000 jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	15340				So I stand with them.	0
ClaimBuster	15341				Mr. President, I'm still speaking.	0
ClaimBuster	15342				But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half -- half of all the people who work in small business.	1
ClaimBuster	15343				But the point is sometimes the action-	0
ClaimBuster	15344				The shift in emphasis has been very disturbing to me, speaking about the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	15345				It's something I've worked on for 15 years.	1
ClaimBuster	15346				With that kind of limitation, on federal spending, we can fully justify the tax reductions that I have proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	15347				That's the kind of leadership we'll continue to show.	0
ClaimBuster	15348				That's in America's national interest and that will be the case so long as I'm president.	1
ClaimBuster	15349				Stop this business about asking gosh, how old are you?	0
ClaimBuster	15350				A free Iraq will help secure Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	15351				Soldiers who are overseas fighting for us right now.	0
ClaimBuster	15352				I would certainly uh - not cut out atomic power altogether.	0
ClaimBuster	15353				I believe there needs to be instant disclosure on the Internet as to who has given to who.	0
ClaimBuster	15354				I believe Palestinians ought to have a state, but I know they need leadership that's committed to a democracy and freedom, leadership that would be willing to reject terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	15355				Clearly nobody's going to think the president started out thinking he was going to trade arms for hostages.	0
ClaimBuster	15356				I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again...	0
ClaimBuster	15357				Think of your dreams as a child and ask yourself, isn't it time to stop talking about it?	0
ClaimBuster	15358				We're going to get them out; we're going to secure the border.	0
ClaimBuster	15359				It seems to me that our tax structure today has rates that are too high.	0
ClaimBuster	15360				It's not being taken away from anybody else, except we'll downsize the Department of Education.	0
ClaimBuster	15361				We will make some gains in the United States Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	15362				And he went out and he did it.	1
ClaimBuster	15363				Charter schools aren't the only answer, but they're providing competition.	0
ClaimBuster	15364				We need decisions made on sound principles.	0
ClaimBuster	15365				Let's not let them fool with it anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	15366				Our allies know, -- they're not certain what we're going to do, what our reaction, what our response is going to be.	0
ClaimBuster	15367				Well, again, the president just said, categorically, my opponent is against this, my opponent is against that.	1
ClaimBuster	15368				That is not the way you deal with the Soviets.	0
ClaimBuster	15369				... in order to give -- in order to give additional tax cuts to Joe the plumber before he was at the point where he could make $250,000.	0
ClaimBuster	15370				But one of the things we've learned is, is that when we take that approach, whether it's in North Korea or in Iran, then we have a better chance at better outcomes.	0
ClaimBuster	15371				Then companies won't come here.	0
ClaimBuster	15372				If the Vice President of the United States thinks that Robert Bork was an outstanding appointment (Cheers and Applause)	0
ClaimBuster	15373				I think it's not just an economic issue, I think it's a moral issue.	0
ClaimBuster	15374				We're spending a third more on all of the -- well, all of the programs of human service.	1
ClaimBuster	15375				Look, the genius of America is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work on an idea, make their own decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	15376				We'll never succeed in Iraq if the Iraqi citizens do not want to take matters into their own hands to protect themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	15377				I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.	1
ClaimBuster	15378				For one thing, let me just follow up here.	0
ClaimBuster	15379				So it seems to me that we ought to take that money we can save from the Department of Education, put it into opportunity scholarships and tell little Landale Shakespeare out in Cleveland, Ohio, and tell your mother and father, you're going to get to go to school because we're going to match what the state puts up, and you're going to go to the school of your choice.	0
ClaimBuster	15380				Thank you for your question.	0
ClaimBuster	15381				And it will have, I think, an important effect on the price of a barrel of oil.	0
ClaimBuster	15382				It's completely out of control.	0
ClaimBuster	15383				But nothing is more important than us no longer borrowing $700 billion or more from China and sending it to Saudi Arabia.	1
ClaimBuster	15384				The wages of Americans have gone down.	1
ClaimBuster	15385				That was a command decision made by the commanders on the spot and based with what they thought was best for the men there.	1
ClaimBuster	15386				Particularly where it's someone where you've had business dealings.	0
ClaimBuster	15387				We submitted the biggest drug budget ever.	1
ClaimBuster	15388				Chinese Communists have been moving ahead the last ten years.	0
ClaimBuster	15389				You're going to have to watch it.	0
ClaimBuster	15390				Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.	0
ClaimBuster	15391				I'm the last one, right?	0
ClaimBuster	15392				"We're telling other people, ""You can't have nuclear weapons,"" but we're pursuing a new nuclear weapon that we might even contemplate using."	1
ClaimBuster	15393				"Say, ""Look, here's what we can do."	0
ClaimBuster	15394				Von Fremd, the first thing we have to do is to continue to keep confidence abroad in the American dollar.	0
ClaimBuster	15395				Why do we start things that we know the Soviets will match and make us all less secure?	0
ClaimBuster	15396				He said that a fish rots from the head down as he was going after Ed Meese.	1
ClaimBuster	15397				Every time you do that you take a risk.	0
ClaimBuster	15398				It was a promise for less government and less taxes and more freedom for the people.	0
ClaimBuster	15399				But I'm also a serious guy.	0
ClaimBuster	15400				I'm not so sure that it means steadily higher fuel costs, but I do believe that this nation has been portrayed for too long a time to the people as being energy-poor when it is energy-rich.	0
ClaimBuster	15401				You were promised a middle-class tax cut in 1992.	1
ClaimBuster	15402				The fact is that in too many parts of our country, we still have discrimination.	0
ClaimBuster	15403				So we've got to innovate through school choice.	0
ClaimBuster	15404				We haven't heard from the governor any specifics beyond Big Bird and eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood in terms of how he pays for that.	1
ClaimBuster	15405				It wasn't created as a welfare program.	1
ClaimBuster	15406				Just to uh - correct the record, Mr. Nixon said on depletion that his record was the opposite of mine.	1
ClaimBuster	15407				It was an energy bill on the floor of the Senate loaded down with goodies, billions for the oil companies, and it was sponsored by Bush and Cheney.	1
ClaimBuster	15408				They cover 98% of their people and their insurance premiums are much cheaper than the rest of America, and so does Rochester, New York.	1
ClaimBuster	15409				I appreciate the jobs in coal and oil and gas.	0
ClaimBuster	15410				I would never tolerate it as president of the United States, and I will hope that Senator Kennedy will change his mind if he should be elected.	0
ClaimBuster	15411				And, absolutely, I wanted a cessation of the violence, because it put an enormous strain on Georgia, and that's why I was the first to say that we have to rebuild the Georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild.	1
ClaimBuster	15412				And in addition to that, we need programs, particularly in higher education, which will stimulate scientific breakthroughs which will bring more growth.	0
ClaimBuster	15413				The Wall Street Journal said your numbers don't add up.	1
ClaimBuster	15414				Let's talk about military spending, and that's this.	0
ClaimBuster	15415				I've campaigned on this since the primaries.	1
ClaimBuster	15416				What I've said is that we have to store it safely.	1
ClaimBuster	15417				What do we do then?	0
ClaimBuster	15418				This bill imposes upon employers the responsibility of determining whether somebody who applies for a job is an American or not.	1
ClaimBuster	15419				I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people.	0
ClaimBuster	15420				"When I say ""phony spirit,"" I mean phony, not because the spirit is not good on our side, but because the Soviet Union simply doesn't intend to carry out what they say."	0
ClaimBuster	15421				I've got a bracelet, too, from Sergeant - from the mother of Sergeant Ryan David Jopeck (ph), given to me in green bay.	1
ClaimBuster	15422				And I was able to do so with a lot of Democrat votes, nearly 50% of the Hispanic vote, about 27% of the African-American vote, because people know I'm a conservative person and a compassionate person.	1
ClaimBuster	15423				But when he's asked, how are you going to do it, which deductions, which loopholes are you going to close?	0
ClaimBuster	15424				The Senate Budget Committee --	0
ClaimBuster	15425				But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	15426				And I just think that we ought to do everything we can to respect the American family.	0
ClaimBuster	15427				Including Senators previously who had supported it on the Republican side.	0
ClaimBuster	15428				And where it's been done, those schools, like in Rochester, those schools that weren't chosen find that they then compete and do better.	1
ClaimBuster	15429				We have to stop the spending, which has mortgaged your children's futures.	0
ClaimBuster	15430				You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product.	0
ClaimBuster	15431				I think that we could not afford not to do these things.	0
ClaimBuster	15432				In effect, what Senator Kennedy recommends is that the United States government should give help to the exiles and to those within Cuba who oppose the Castro regime - provided they are anti-Batista.	1
ClaimBuster	15433				He is -- listen, they went through a horrible situation in Beslan, where these terrorists gunned down young school kids.	1
ClaimBuster	15434				But even in this area, where I think new legislation would be justified, uh the Congress has not responded.	0
ClaimBuster	15435				And the answer is, no, I will not have a litmus test.	0
ClaimBuster	15436				You can't do it with the school bureaucracy controlling everything and that's why we have a new program that I hope people have heard about.	0
ClaimBuster	15437				What would you do if you were the Israelis and the president of a country says that they are -- they are determined to wipe you off the map, calls your country a stinking corpse?	0
ClaimBuster	15438				No, I don't, because I think that America has to stand with democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	15439				One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones -- we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out.	0
ClaimBuster	15440				Well, Aleppo is a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	15441				You were very clear that you would not provide, government assistance to the U.S. auto companies, even if they went through bankruptcy.	1
ClaimBuster	15442				Now finally, with regard to the whole problem of combating recession, as you call it, we must use the full resources of the government in these respects: one, we must see to it that credit is expanded as we go into any recessionary period - and understand, I do not believe we're going into a recession.	0
ClaimBuster	15443				And the Taliban is no longer in power, and Al Qaida no longer has a place to plan.	1
ClaimBuster	15444				I just can't do it.	0
ClaimBuster	15445				Well, you know, as I travel around the country, this is one of the single most frequently asked issues that I get, is the issue of health care.	0
ClaimBuster	15446				And these folks are just dividing up 199 billion bucks and the children get lost.	1
ClaimBuster	15447				He added the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation, and it came, at that time, to 12.5% under President Ford.	1
ClaimBuster	15448				It's ruining us in trade.	0
ClaimBuster	15449				And I have long ago said I supported the president on this other matter.	1
ClaimBuster	15450				And he talked about how optimistic he was and the country was about heading toward elections.	1
ClaimBuster	15451				Let me come back in one moment to that, but I want to speak for a second, if I can, to what the president said about fiscal responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	15452				The final point that I would like to make is this: Senator Kennedy has suggested in his speeches that we lack compassion for the poor, for the old, and for others that are unfortunate.	1
ClaimBuster	15453				During the last five years, Texas's government has gone up in size.	1
ClaimBuster	15454				Sometimes he has to act.	0
ClaimBuster	15455				We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on those who actually killed us on 9/11.	1
ClaimBuster	15456				I believe that it's accurate to say that - that the - that the committees to whom you refer with the - the employment that you uh - state, and with the 5 to 5 and a half percent growth rate in our economy, that the uh - projections would be a uh - a $60 billion increase in the amount of money that we'd have to spend in l981 compared to now.	1
ClaimBuster	15457				That's why I'm proud and grateful to be a citizen of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	15458				Iran now and Russia are now against us.	1
ClaimBuster	15459				If we could've stopped Rwanda, surely, if we had the ability, that would be something that we would have to strongly consider and act.	0
ClaimBuster	15460				What the American people can't afford, though, is four more years of failed economic policies.	0
ClaimBuster	15461				And we had an initiative that we were working on to raise women's pay.	1
ClaimBuster	15462				We have to restore trust.	0
ClaimBuster	15463				So I rolled the dice, I put my career on the line because I really believe the future of America is on the line.	0
ClaimBuster	15464				I think a targeted tax cut is better for our future, targeted to education and child rearing, with the rest of the education plan, hooking up all of our classrooms to the Internet by the year 2000.	0
ClaimBuster	15465				It was a superb occasion.	0
ClaimBuster	15466				One of our first officers was a woman, the chief financial officer.	1
ClaimBuster	15467				The bills that I vetoed, the one for an additional $6 billion, was not a bill that would have solved our unemployment problems.	1
ClaimBuster	15468				Asia will be our largest trading partner in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	15469				We have an adversarial relationship that's destroying jobs and sending them overseas while we have the finest workers in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	15470				It's not good to raise the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	15471				And just in that respect, I say it's rigged, because she should never...	0
ClaimBuster	15472				If you're married, we reduced the marriage penalty.	1
ClaimBuster	15473				We cannot pay off the $4 trillion debt, balance the budget and have the industries of the future and the high- paying jobs in this country without having the revenue.	1
ClaimBuster	15474				I believe we can set our priorities.	0
ClaimBuster	15475				Governor Rockefeller says five per cent.	1
ClaimBuster	15476				Your future benefits would be cut by the amount that's diverted into the stock market.	1
ClaimBuster	15477				In fact, he doubled it.	1
ClaimBuster	15478				And believe me, they're not doing it to get me elected.	0
ClaimBuster	15479				Bob, we relied upon a company out of England to provide about half of the flu vaccines for the United States citizen, and it turned out that the vaccine they were producing was contaminated.	1
ClaimBuster	15480				I think that would help.	0
ClaimBuster	15481				"You've got to be able to look in the eyes of families and say to those parents, ""I tried to do everything in my power to prevent the loss of your son and daughter."""	0
ClaimBuster	15482				Our d- security depends upon Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	15483				Did Khrushchev gain because he took his shoe off and pounded the table and shouted and insulted?	0
ClaimBuster	15484				I heard more of the same.	0
ClaimBuster	15485				They have to include the other countries of Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	15486				And not about personal things.	0
ClaimBuster	15487				That would be an abrogation of our agreement with NATO.	1
ClaimBuster	15488				I want to take that $716 billion you've cut and put it back into Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	15489				We are a force of good in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	15490				When you came to office 32 million people on food stamps.	1
ClaimBuster	15491				We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines.	1
ClaimBuster	15492				Well, first, Jim, let me thank you and thank you, Senator Dole, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen, all of you listening tonight for the chance you've given us to appear.	0
ClaimBuster	15493				The fact happens to be that education spending is up by the federal government; it is up.	1
ClaimBuster	15494				Yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also.	1
ClaimBuster	15495				The unemployment, the number of people who are still looking for work, is still 23 million Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	15496				This is wrong, and we have to do something about it.	0
ClaimBuster	15497				No U.S. soldier ever dies in vain because they're carrying out the missions of their commander in chief.	0
ClaimBuster	15498				It was a remarkable event.	1
ClaimBuster	15499				And the best America is not behind us.	0
ClaimBuster	15500				We did propose a regulation six months after I became President under the law he mentioned.	1
ClaimBuster	15501				It would be likely that they would uphold Roe v. Wade.	0
ClaimBuster	15502				I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	15503				Oh, there were occasional snipings and sometimes some artillery fire, but we did not engage in conflict that was out of line with our mission.	0
ClaimBuster	15504				And that will be as bad as NAFTA.	0
ClaimBuster	15505				That I can tell you.	0
ClaimBuster	15506				There's too many issues left unresolved.	0
ClaimBuster	15507				Our thoughts and prayers go out to the lion of the Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	15508				This is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	15509				I will find the best people in the world -- in the United States of America who have a history of strict adherence to the Constitution.	0
ClaimBuster	15510				There were other issues associated with this -- with this tragedy.	0
ClaimBuster	15511				Look, the problem is that under Governor Bush's plan, $1.6 trillion tax cut, mostly to the wealthy, under his own budget numbers, he proposes spending more money for a tax cut just for the wealthiest 1% than all the new money he budgets for education, health care and national defense combined.	1
ClaimBuster	15512				Now, I'm a plain-speaking man and I learned long ago that your word was your bond.	0
ClaimBuster	15513				Number three, women can't be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act.	1
ClaimBuster	15514				My opponent said this is a bitterly divided time.	1
ClaimBuster	15515				"I remember the vice president saying, ""Just give us a chance to get up there, we're going to make sure you get tax cuts."""	1
ClaimBuster	15516				But in the last 24 hours there has been some subsiding of the violence there.	1
ClaimBuster	15517				The difficulty, of course, is that we do have heavy obligations abroad, that we therefore have to maintain not only a favorable balance of trade but also send a good deal of our dollars overseas to pay our troops, maintain our bases, and sustain other economies.	0
ClaimBuster	15518				I think we have been right in carrying it.	0
ClaimBuster	15519				We need more work on value-added processing.	0
ClaimBuster	15520				That's 16 million jobs in America.	1
ClaimBuster	15521				But it was also military.	1
ClaimBuster	15522				I first proposed a long time ago that we would have to examine every agency and every bureaucracy of government.	1
ClaimBuster	15523				Well, of course, where has the private sector been, Governor Reagan, during the years that our cities have been deteriorating?	0
ClaimBuster	15524				You are going to drive business out.	0
ClaimBuster	15525				You can't do that as president.	0
ClaimBuster	15526				I thought the best example of a way to handle the situation was East Timor when we provided logistical support to the Australians, support that only we can provide.	0
ClaimBuster	15527				"When you give us access, we'll give you access."""	0
ClaimBuster	15528				You've bought a front row box seat and you're not happy with your health care and you're saying tonight we've got bad health care but very expensive health care.	0
ClaimBuster	15529				He's the one that brought up, to garner primary votes, the whole question of the ACLU.	0
ClaimBuster	15530				And he was a risk that -- and this is where we just have a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	15531				And Jerry Falwell says that means we get two or three judges.	1
ClaimBuster	15532				I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	15533				And we have weakened our position in NATO because the other countries in Europe supported the democ- democratic forces in Portugal long before we did; we stuck to the Portugal dictatorships much longer than other democracies did in this world.	1
ClaimBuster	15534				The situation today cries out for bipartisanship.	0
ClaimBuster	15535				Well, if you watched my television show the other night, you saw it.	0
ClaimBuster	15536				And that's the kind of judge I'm going to put on there.	0
ClaimBuster	15537				Four, we're going to say if you receive federal money, measure third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grade.	0
ClaimBuster	15538				It's going to be a test of our nerve and will.	0
ClaimBuster	15539				They wonder how an elected representative uh - can serve them and participate in such activities uh - serving in the Congress of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	15540				Jim, if I could just respond.	0
ClaimBuster	15541				And if there are any federal employees in this group, you know what that means.	0
ClaimBuster	15542				In terms of in response to the question, no.	0
ClaimBuster	15543				And I believe you're right on to something, that if we don't change the education we're not going to be able to compete.	0
ClaimBuster	15544				I have a plan to put people back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	15545				Part of that, as the Gallup Polls show, is because the Soviet Union made a breakthrough in outer space.	1
ClaimBuster	15546				I understand what the president is talking about, because I know what it means to lose people in combat.	0
ClaimBuster	15547				Tipper and I have been married for 30 years.	1
ClaimBuster	15548				That's the kind of defense program that uh - Mr. Carter wants.	1
ClaimBuster	15549				But, you know, I think my ideas are better for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	15550				Whether you borrow the money or whether you simply tax it away from the people, you're taking the same amount of money out of the private sector, unless and until you bring down government's share of what it is taking.	0
ClaimBuster	15551				I think we ought to be lifting them up and moving our children forward.	0
ClaimBuster	15552				You know, my friends, my parents came to this country as immigrants like millions and millions of Americans before them and since, seeking opportunities, seeking the American dream.	1
ClaimBuster	15553				There are no more than a handful of American military personnel in Haiti now.	1
ClaimBuster	15554				We don't have time for on-the-job training, my friends.	0
ClaimBuster	15555				He promised -- he -- you know -- let me just say --	1
ClaimBuster	15556				That was more than a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	15557				Quite often Congress has passed laws in the past designed to help people with uh - the ownership of homes and with the control of crime and with adequate health care and education programs and so forth.	1
ClaimBuster	15558				Therefore that treaty does not commit the United States to defend anything except Formosa and the Pescadores, and to deal with acts against that treaty area.	1
ClaimBuster	15559				Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere.	0
ClaimBuster	15560				I've worked on this issue.	1
ClaimBuster	15561				And all you have to do is look at the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	15562				I don't look on it personally as relevant, and I consider it really a waste of time tonight, when you consider the issues that face our country right now.	0
ClaimBuster	15563				And the president has chosen a policy that makes it impossible for our scientists to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	15564				Nobody's been talking about that, and Senator McCain knows it.	0
ClaimBuster	15565				The federal government puts about 6% of the money up.	1
ClaimBuster	15566				Step one, we want to put America back to work, clean up the small business problem, have one task force at work on that.	0
ClaimBuster	15567				Therefore, you don't know what's it like.	0
ClaimBuster	15568				They sent me a picture of her in the classroom.	1
ClaimBuster	15569				That's what the question in this campaign is about.	0
ClaimBuster	15570				President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters.	1
ClaimBuster	15571				I did not say that.	1
ClaimBuster	15572				Well I think we should st- strengthen our conventional forces, and we should attempt in January, February, and March of next year to increase the airlift capacity of our conventional forces.	0
ClaimBuster	15573				And we need law and order.	0
ClaimBuster	15574				And when I am re-elected, I believe one of the first things ought to be to press a new Congress not beholden to the old ways to pass financial reform legislation that modernizes the banking system, doesn't put a lot of inhibitions on it, and protects the depositors through keeping the FDIC sound.	0
ClaimBuster	15575				I'll close on this point.	0
ClaimBuster	15576				How about Sandra Day O'Connor as an example?	0
ClaimBuster	15577				It's against my political interest to say go ahead and go along with the tax increase, but I did what I thought was right at the time.	1
ClaimBuster	15578				We don't have inflation because the people are living too well.	0
ClaimBuster	15579				We have made good progress, and there is no doubt in my mind that the commitment to unemployment compensation, the minimum wage, welfare, national health insurance, those kinds of commitments that have typified the Democratic party since ancient history in this country's political life are a very important element of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	15580				First of all, to channel research and development funds into areas that will provide uh large numbers of jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	15581				Everybody goes to Delaware, because they've got very -- pretty loose laws when it comes to things like credit cards.	1
ClaimBuster	15582				And community colleges are on the job.	1
ClaimBuster	15583				Now if we continue with these policies, this trillion and a half dollars worth of new debt that's already been added on the backs of the American taxpayer is going to increase even more, and if we continue with this for another four years, then I'm worried about the next generation, whether we can ever turn this situation around.	1
ClaimBuster	15584				In my view that's going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past.	0
ClaimBuster	15585				I've said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said.	0
ClaimBuster	15586				We have much to do to step up that war, to double the number of drug enforcement agents, to fight both here and abroad, to work with our neighbors in this hemisphere.	0
ClaimBuster	15587				A governor gets to name supreme court judges.	1
ClaimBuster	15588				That's -- that's important, of course.	0
ClaimBuster	15589				And I have supported the largest pay raise in many a year, and I support another one now.	1
ClaimBuster	15590				And I think that's that's the thrust we will make.	0
ClaimBuster	15591				Ninety-eight percent of America, I'm giving you a tax cut and I'm giving you health care.	1
ClaimBuster	15592				One of the reasons I regret it is that getting a detail wrong interfered several times with the point that I was trying to make.	0
ClaimBuster	15593				That's not the role of a president to decide right and wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	15594				And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right?	0
ClaimBuster	15595				The reason I did so was because I was worried that activist judges are actually defining the definition of marriage, and the surest way to protect marriage between a man and woman is to amend the Constitution.	0
ClaimBuster	15596				We could have saved more lives if we had acted earlier.	0
ClaimBuster	15597				What I can promise you is that I will make the playing field as fair as possible, that I will, for instance, make certain that with respect to the tax system that you as a worker in America are not subsidizing the loss of your job.	0
ClaimBuster	15598				So I think our record of cutting back employees, plus the failure on the part of the Governor's programs to actually save employment in Georgia, shows which is the better plan.	0
ClaimBuster	15599				Right now, the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year.	1
ClaimBuster	15600				We stand for those values and we have to be willing to assert them.	0
ClaimBuster	15601				The reason incomes are down is because unemployment is so high.	1
ClaimBuster	15602				Hey, if she had a problem -- for 30 years she's been doing this, Anderson.	1
ClaimBuster	15603				King Abdullah of Jordan said just yesterday or the day before you can't hold elections in Iraq with the chaos that's going on today.	1
ClaimBuster	15604				Now, we also have people sicker because they don't have health insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	15605				I've stated on many occasions that the United States must meet its commitment on Berlin.	0
ClaimBuster	15606				Through the years I have sat in the National Security Council.	1
ClaimBuster	15607				And by the way, you skipped Israel, our closest friend in the region, but you went to the other nations.	1
ClaimBuster	15608				I agree our military is the strongest in the world today, that's not the question.	1
ClaimBuster	15609				The interest rates are based on inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	15610				I'm trying to save your Medicare, just as I rescued Social Security with a bipartisan commission.	1
ClaimBuster	15611				I think that there are situations like in Bosnia or Kosovo where there's a genocide, where our national security is at stake there.	0
ClaimBuster	15612				We've got a backdoor draft taking place in America today: people with stop-loss programs where they're told you can't get out of the military; nine out of our 10 active duty divisions committed to Iraq one way or the other, either going, coming or preparing.	1
ClaimBuster	15613				And so I think when you look at those results, you know the plan I've laid out for the future has a very good chance of being enacted if you'll give me a chance to build that bridge to the 21st Century.	0
ClaimBuster	15614				This current administration's worked hard to keep the parties at the table.	0
ClaimBuster	15615				I would meet with the leaders of the Congress, with all the newly elected members of the Congress and as many others with whom I could meet between the time of the election and the inauguration, and we would present a jobs program.	0
ClaimBuster	15616				All that I can say is this: what we need here are not just high hopes.	0
ClaimBuster	15617				No, and I have to (Applause)	0
ClaimBuster	15618				I'd rather be able to have an insurance company.	0
ClaimBuster	15619				And we've been through a lot together during the last 3 3/4 years.	1
ClaimBuster	15620				I met that woman again.	1
ClaimBuster	15621				If he wants to start, he can start.	0
ClaimBuster	15622				I didn't think he necessarily made the right decision to take land troops off the table right before we committed ourselves offensively, but nevertheless, it worked.	1
ClaimBuster	15623				However, I honor the right of people who seek the constitutional amendments on school busing, on uh - prayer in the schools and an abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	15624				But I am asking for your help and assistance to be president for the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	15625				Now in determining how we deal with this issue, we must find the answer to a very important but simple question: who threatens the peace?	0
ClaimBuster	15626				Mr. May, I recently saw a Princeton University study that indicated that the cities of America - the large cities of this country - are in worse shape today than they were in 1960.	1
ClaimBuster	15627				And we're in real trouble on that.	0
ClaimBuster	15628				I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over.	0
ClaimBuster	15629				So let's be clear about my tax plan and Senator McCain's, because we're not going to be able to deal with entitlements unless we understand the revenues coming in.	0
ClaimBuster	15630				I think that, you know, I would hope to be able to convince people I could handle the Iraqi situation better.	0
ClaimBuster	15631				So I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	15632				And if Israel is attacked, we have their back, not just diplomatically, not just culturally, but militarily.	0
ClaimBuster	15633				I just thought when I came into office it was time that there was some realistic talk to and about the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	15634				Who do you want to start with?	0
ClaimBuster	15635				17 new taxes, spend 1.5 trillion dollars, 50 new bureaucracies.	1
ClaimBuster	15636				Last year under Mr. Ford, of all the Food for Peace that went to South America, 85 percent went to the military dictatorship in Chile.	1
ClaimBuster	15637				I think it's -- before I came in, my wife and daughter and I had a prayer.	1
ClaimBuster	15638				And thank you to the people of Hartford, our hosts.	0
ClaimBuster	15639				Betty and I have worked very hard to give our children a brighter future in the United States, our beloved country.	0
ClaimBuster	15640				Our Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case.	1
ClaimBuster	15641				Yours is phased in in eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	15642				Now, let me tell you what I favor instead.	0
ClaimBuster	15643				Thirty years ago, there were three policemen for every crime.	1
ClaimBuster	15644				This puts us on a road to Greece.	0
ClaimBuster	15645				Get a variety of choices to make in their lives.	0
ClaimBuster	15646				Now, I just believe that what we have to do is enforce the civil rights laws.	0
ClaimBuster	15647				I promised, when we took office, that we would reduce inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	15648				When I met her in the backyard at Joe and Jan O'Neill's in Midland, Texas, it was the classic backyard barbecue.	1
ClaimBuster	15649				And that's where the President's failure to master, in my opinion, the essential elements of arms control has cost us dearly.	0
ClaimBuster	15650				And I think that most of our people -- this is why we had a 25-percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up.	1
ClaimBuster	15651				Well, there are a range of things that are probably going to have to be delayed.	0
ClaimBuster	15652				Got rid of a despot who had killed Americans and as a consequence, despite this tragedy, you had tens of thousands of Libyans after the events in Benghazi marching and saying America is our friend.	1
ClaimBuster	15653				We wanted to have the right of self-determination in southern Africa.	0
ClaimBuster	15654				We're going as fast as the experts say we should.	1
ClaimBuster	15655				That's why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don't let terrorists buy weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	15656				It's three times bigger than what President Clinton proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	15657				What I want you to understand is the national debt is not the only cause of that.	0
ClaimBuster	15658				The record shows that I'm right.	1
ClaimBuster	15659				I would eliminate the tariff on imported sugarcane-based ethanol from Brazil.	0
ClaimBuster	15660				And some people in high positions of leadership, tell us that the answer is to retreat.	0
ClaimBuster	15661				The current system today has meant a lot for a lot of seniors, and I really appreciate the intentions of the current system as I mentioned.	0
ClaimBuster	15662				They're seeing their premiums, their co-pays go up.	1
ClaimBuster	15663				So don't tell me about words.	0
ClaimBuster	15664				Well, I'm saying that Senator Dole said in his fine speech in San Diego that he wanted to build a bridge to the past.	1
ClaimBuster	15665				First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists.	1
ClaimBuster	15666				I have seen Cuba go to the Communists.	1
ClaimBuster	15667				But now we find that the countries of Europe for example, that we have aided, and Japan, that we've aided in the Far East; these countries - some our former enemies, have now recovered completely.	1
ClaimBuster	15668				So these are the differences.	0
ClaimBuster	15669				But, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as they're advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	15670				And I will continue working with him over the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	15671				Entertainment industry, people involved in the schools, education.	0
ClaimBuster	15672				And the Russians need to understand that.	0
ClaimBuster	15673				Secondly, we need to have a commitment in the uh private sector uh - to cooperate with government in matters like housing.	0
ClaimBuster	15674				And the Perot voters that are looking for a home ought to take a look at the Republican record.	0
ClaimBuster	15675				And as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan.	1
ClaimBuster	15676				The Soviet Union is no more, and now we're working to help them become totally democratic through the Freedom Support Act that I led on, a great Democratic ambassador, Bob Strauss, over there, Jim Baker, all of us got this thing passed -- through cooperation, Ross -- it worked with cooperation, and you're for that, I'm sure, helping Russia become democratic.	1
ClaimBuster	15677				And she ended up living alone by choice.	1
ClaimBuster	15678				But the last thing we ought to do is make those who wear the uniforms sacrifice.	0
ClaimBuster	15679				We just recently ended those drive-by deliveries saying people can't be kicked out of the hospital by insurance companies when they've just had babies.	1
ClaimBuster	15680				That's where two- thirds of the new jobs are going to come from.	0
ClaimBuster	15681				It works particularly when we pay our troops well.	0
ClaimBuster	15682				And that leads me to some different conclusions from Senator Dole.	0
ClaimBuster	15683				The average cost of a health care insurance plan in America today is $5,800.	1
ClaimBuster	15684				I have a tremendous income.	1
ClaimBuster	15685				But what's been happening over the last couple of years is, as we've watched this tumult in the Middle East, this rising tide of chaos occur, you see Al Qaida rushing in, you see other jihadist groups rushing in.	1
ClaimBuster	15686				The 9/11 Commission put out a report that said America is safer but not yet safe.	1
ClaimBuster	15687				First and foremost we have to fully fund LIHEAP which is a way to help low income folks, particularly here in the east to pay for high fuel bills.	0
ClaimBuster	15688				I think we disagree on the implication of his remarks tonight and on the statements that he has made on many occasions during his campaign to the effect that the United States has been standing still.	0
ClaimBuster	15689				The means are at question.	0
ClaimBuster	15690				In terms of programs, I've submitted, what, 4 different budgets to the US Congress in great detail.	1
ClaimBuster	15691				But you have to have some basic ability.	0
ClaimBuster	15692				One press conference he had without sound.	1
ClaimBuster	15693				I said I wasn't perfect.	0
ClaimBuster	15694				Over the next four years, we'll continue to work to make sure health care is available and affordable.	0
ClaimBuster	15695				His experience didn't prevent him from participating or involving or in some way being involved in the relationship between this government and Mr. Noriega and drug trafficking in Panama.	0
ClaimBuster	15696				You've got to be clear, both to our allies and our enemies, about where you stand and what you mean.	0
ClaimBuster	15697				The Soviet Union relationship with Syria is at a very low point.	1
ClaimBuster	15698				The economic growth is less than half today what it was at the beginning of this year.	1
ClaimBuster	15699				I believe Governor Romney is a good man.	0
ClaimBuster	15700				Nothing Governor Romney just said is true, starting with this notion of me apologizing.	1
ClaimBuster	15701				We proposed and passed a healthy forest bill which was essential to working with -- particularly in Western states -- to make sure that our forests were protected.	1
ClaimBuster	15702				I want to invest in hard-working families.	0
ClaimBuster	15703				That has been their priority.	0
ClaimBuster	15704				Or, alternatively, it's got to be paid for, not only by closing deductions for wealthy individuals, that -- that will pay for about 4 percent reduction in tax rates.	0
ClaimBuster	15705				We gave them ample time.	0
ClaimBuster	15706				And now this economy is growing.	1
ClaimBuster	15707				Who threatens freedom in the world?	0
ClaimBuster	15708				General Colin Powell said the same thing, he fears the initiative would take away the extra effort programs.	1
ClaimBuster	15709				We ought to make them disclose the people they've given money to when they're testifying before congressional committees; we ought to close the lawyers' loopholes; they ought to have to disclose when they're really lobbying.	0
ClaimBuster	15710				It's also going to make sure that you're not paying as much for gas.	0
ClaimBuster	15711				I am running for President as an Independent because I believe our country is in trouble.	1
ClaimBuster	15712				I could do that very quickly.	0
ClaimBuster	15713				I'm very proud to be the Republican nominee reaching out to Democrats and Independents.	0
ClaimBuster	15714				Right now, what happens is those employees get dumped into either the Medicaid system, which taxpayers pick up, or they're going to the emergency room for uncompensated care, which everybody picks up in their premiums.	1
ClaimBuster	15715				But if and when you do it, Jim, you have to do it in a way that passes the test, that passes the global test where your countrymen, your people understand fully why you're doing what you're doing and you can prove to the world that you did it for legitimate reasons.	0
ClaimBuster	15716				Number three, Castro is only the beginning of our difficulties throughout Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	15717				I'll bring them home with victory and with honor and that is a fundamental difference.	0
ClaimBuster	15718				If we are going to have the initiative in the world, we must remember that the people of Africa and Asia and Latin America don't want to be pawns simply in a struggle between two great powers - the Soviet Union and the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	15719				And you voted to cut services to 23 million school children under the safe and drug-free schools act.	1
ClaimBuster	15720				But what the American people understand is that I look at what we need to get done to keep the American people safe and to move our interests forward, and I make those decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	15721				We created 23 million new jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	15722				Just as I fought for our country as a young man, with the same passion I will fight to defend this nation that I love.	1
ClaimBuster	15723				And in that situation, what happens is, is that the protections you have, the consumer protections that you need, you're not going to have available to you.	0
ClaimBuster	15724				But we have a very different view about how to make America stronger and safer.	0
ClaimBuster	15725				And -- and that is part of what's at stake in this election.	0
ClaimBuster	15726				--because the people, not the special interests, put me there.	0
ClaimBuster	15727				Children across our country don't have health care.	1
ClaimBuster	15728				There's a big difference between the two of us.	0
ClaimBuster	15729				This is the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	15730				And I think that's a good thing.	0
ClaimBuster	15731				This morning, I got a call from the skipper of the Mayaguez.	1
ClaimBuster	15732				He now wants to take the six-party talks we have -- China, North Korea, South Korea, Russia, Japan and the United States -- and undermine them by having bilateral talks.	0
ClaimBuster	15733				I believe in our parks.	0
ClaimBuster	15734				Actually, I made my intentions -- made my views clear.	0
ClaimBuster	15735				So what I want to do is I want to call upon Republicans and Democrats to forget all the arguing and finger pointing, and come together and take care of our seniors' prescription drug program, that says we'll pay for the poor seniors, we'll help all seniors with prescription drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	15736				And if there is any inequities in oil or any other commodity, then I would vote to close that loophole, I have voted in the past to reduce the depletion allowance for the largest producers; for those from five million dollars down, to maintain it at twenty-seven and a half per cent.	1
ClaimBuster	15737				Let me make one other point.	0
ClaimBuster	15738				I think of those people that took us back into space again, Rick Houk and that crew, as people that are worthy of this.	1
ClaimBuster	15739				You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity.	0
ClaimBuster	15740				And so let's do it for most all, but not completely eliminate it for the very top.	0
ClaimBuster	15741				I would hope I never have to.	0
ClaimBuster	15742				And now we see beheadings.	1
ClaimBuster	15743				We simply cannot have people sitting one behind the wheel of a car in these long traffic jams going in and out of our great cities.	0
ClaimBuster	15744				They avoided even the advice of their own general.	1
ClaimBuster	15745				I think the American people will be called upon to uh - uh - be in the forefront in giving leadership to the solution of those problems that must be solved in the Middle East, in southern Africa, and any problems that might arise in the Pacific.	0
ClaimBuster	15746				Their ideas is to raise taxes and spend more money.	0
ClaimBuster	15747				Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.	0
ClaimBuster	15748				The trends before we -- before I got my current job were on the decline, the number of divisions were reduced.	1
ClaimBuster	15749				And I'm going to offer it to America.	0
ClaimBuster	15750				You've had your chance, Vice President, you've been there for eight years and nothing has been done.	1
ClaimBuster	15751				But by speaking clearly and sending messages that we mean what we say, we've affected the world in a positive way.	0
ClaimBuster	15752				They exiled some, they jailed some, they murdered some.	1
ClaimBuster	15753				And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.	0
ClaimBuster	15754				We had a substantial increase in new permits for housing.	1
ClaimBuster	15755				We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on Afghanistan, and we did deliver a surge of troops.	1
ClaimBuster	15756				He's just not credible when he talks about being fiscally conservative.	0
ClaimBuster	15757				Also, we had a - a 2 percent increase in the number of employees the last year.	1
ClaimBuster	15758				And a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that.	0
ClaimBuster	15759				We can store and we can reprocess.	0
ClaimBuster	15760				Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately, on four different occasions, he has advocated making Social Security a voluntary system, which would, in effect, very quickly bankrupt it.	1
ClaimBuster	15761				And what you're seeing on all this Iraq-gate is a bunch of people who were wrong on the war trying to cover their necks here and try to do a little revisionism.	0
ClaimBuster	15762				Well, I wasn't the one having trouble explaining it.	1
ClaimBuster	15763				Now, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let's use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do.	0
ClaimBuster	15764				But look what's happened to the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	15765				Those are the kind of specifics that I think we have to discuss on these uh - debates, and these are the kind of programs that I'll talk about on my time.	0
ClaimBuster	15766				And the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program.	1
ClaimBuster	15767				The biggest disaster that could happen is that we not succeed in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	15768				Not one of them selected a Communist government.	1
ClaimBuster	15769				I want to see asymmetrical reductions in conventional forces.	0
ClaimBuster	15770				First of all, we have a big plan to reduce the capital gains tax when people sell their homes.	0
ClaimBuster	15771				We're going to go forward with the Stealth and the D-5 and the advance cruise missile and good conventional forces.	0
ClaimBuster	15772				And it reminds me that it is vital for us not to confuse the war, ever, with the warriors.	0
ClaimBuster	15773				I love the fact that people will listen to a guy with a bad accent and a poor presentation manner talking about flip charts for 30 minutes, because they want the details.	0
ClaimBuster	15774				Plus, we need fiscal discipline.	0
ClaimBuster	15775				So this is going to be an important issue.	0
ClaimBuster	15776				We've got to show moral support for Ukraine.	0
ClaimBuster	15777				If, for example, somebody confesses to the crime and somebody is waiting on death row, there has to be alertness to say wait a minute, have we got the wrong guy?	0
ClaimBuster	15778				What I've done is set priorities and funded them.	1
ClaimBuster	15779				I have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harm's way.	1
ClaimBuster	15780				When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows?	1
ClaimBuster	15781				When you cut back on defense spending, some people are going to be thrown out of work.	0
ClaimBuster	15782				If we're going to combat unemployment, then, we have to do a better job in these areas.	0
ClaimBuster	15783				What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	15784				It's not the length of your resume.	0
ClaimBuster	15785				And so you've got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that.	0
ClaimBuster	15786				These are people that I just happen to know and have a high regard for.	1
ClaimBuster	15787				So I care a lot about this, and I've spent countless hours in schools.	1
ClaimBuster	15788				I have not had the experience the President has had in holding that office, but I think in being Governor of California, the most populous state in the Union - if it were a nation, it would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world - I, too, had some lonely moments and decisions to make.	1
ClaimBuster	15789				We're just in a period -- we've got to work to bring it -- my opponent keeps mentioning John McCain, and I'm glad he did.	1
ClaimBuster	15790				My Secretary of Defense is going to have to make a very difficult decision in which system to go forward with.	0
ClaimBuster	15791				And I believe if we have the option, which scientists tell us we do, of curing Parkinson's, curing diabetes, curing, you know, some kind of a, you know, paraplegic or quadriplegic or, you know, a spinal cord injury, anything, that's the nature of the human spirit.	0
ClaimBuster	15792				But I merely say that the treaty is quite precise and I sustain the treaty.	0
ClaimBuster	15793				A president can't be all things to all people.	0
ClaimBuster	15794				Now, I think the Russians ought to understand that we will support -- we, the United States -- will support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in the natural process, inclusion into NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	15795				Now, it may very well be here in December you'll hear me say, I think there's a safe way to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	15796				Those gray-area weapons systems are creating some problems in a - the agreement for a SALT II negotiation.	1
ClaimBuster	15797				The United States is still the indispensable nation in the aftermath of the Cold War and on the brink of the 21st Century.	0
ClaimBuster	15798				We can help build coalitions but we can't put our troops all around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	15799				Well, I'm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	15800				Let me ask a simple question.	0
ClaimBuster	15801				Senator McCain is absolutely right that the violence has been reduced as a consequence of the extraordinary sacrifice of our troops and our military families.	0
ClaimBuster	15802				As a matter of fact, the tools now given to the terrorist fighters are the same tools that we've been using against drug dealers and white-collar criminals.	1
ClaimBuster	15803				I don't think that's right.	0
ClaimBuster	15804				He went after a federal judge, born in Indiana, but who Donald said couldn't be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican.	1
ClaimBuster	15805				And I think that this is so important.	0
ClaimBuster	15806				You look at the violence that's taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C.	0
ClaimBuster	15807				Well, can I answer that?	0
ClaimBuster	15808				I will pay down the national debt.	0
ClaimBuster	15809				I finally got 'em for 12 to 15 years.	1
ClaimBuster	15810				There is a separation there.	0
ClaimBuster	15811				We should do it in phases.	0
ClaimBuster	15812				That's why we've kept on pushing trade deals, but trade deals that make sure that American workers and American businesses are getting a good deal.	0
ClaimBuster	15813				Yes, in unemployment that is likely to create additional pressure on prices, how willing are you to consider an incomes policy, in other words, wage and price controls?	0
ClaimBuster	15814				The government isn't getting a tax now from businesses there because they aren't there, or from individuals who are on welfare rather than working.	1
ClaimBuster	15815				And then I brought folks together to get it done.	1
ClaimBuster	15816				It is the single greatest threat that this country has.	0
ClaimBuster	15817				There were three Democratic presidents who led us into war.	1
ClaimBuster	15818				Millions and millions of Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	15819				Now, that has nothing to do with learning.	0
ClaimBuster	15820				I don't think that's a bad decision.	0
ClaimBuster	15821				The point is you've got to have a president who's prepared to do this and to begin right away and, preferably, a president who was a governor of a state that's had very, very successful experience at doing this.	0
ClaimBuster	15822				And we had sanctioned them.	1
ClaimBuster	15823				I disagree with Mr. Perot that the answer is to raise -- put a 50-cent gas tax on the middle class and raise more taxes on the middle class and the working poor than on the wealthy.	0
ClaimBuster	15824				You know, half of all immigrants -- undocumented immigrants in our country -- actually pay federal income tax.	1
ClaimBuster	15825				So there's a -- this is a society that -- of ours that's got to do a better job of teaching children right from wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	15826				Number 2, I think you have to take on specifically the insurance companies and require them to make some significant change in the way they rate people in the big community pools.	0
ClaimBuster	15827				So when you say that I wanted to take the auto industry bankrupt, you actually did.	0
ClaimBuster	15828				Nobody did any of this with evil intent.	0
ClaimBuster	15829				I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college.	0
ClaimBuster	15830				That's how they do things.	0
ClaimBuster	15831				The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	15832				So, if it's time for action, I think I have experience that counts.	0
ClaimBuster	15833				It's hundreds of millions of ads.	1
ClaimBuster	15834				It just reminds me of, you know, he says that he's going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan.	1
ClaimBuster	15835				The problem is they'll be in china.	0
ClaimBuster	15836				We haven't seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.	0
ClaimBuster	15837				So I believe that we need to reward these good teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	15838				He talked about the unemployed.	1
ClaimBuster	15839				And so I favor, strongly favor, term limits.	0
ClaimBuster	15840				But there is no corner on this sleaze factor, believe me.	0
ClaimBuster	15841				Will it be a nightmare world threatened with the proliferation of atomic bombs, not just in five major countries but dozens of smaller countries that have been permitted to develop atomic weapons because of a failure of our top leadership to stop proliferation?	1
ClaimBuster	15842				Now I would not provide a litmus test.	0
ClaimBuster	15843				But we also have to have a short-term fix, in my view, and long- term fixes.	0
ClaimBuster	15844				Our industrial competitors, who are beating us in competition, spend less and have better health care.	1
ClaimBuster	15845				The fact of the matter is that employers who today are insuring their employees are paying the freight, because they're paying for those who aren't.	0
ClaimBuster	15846				I want flexibility, and I do you know, these people laugh about the thousand points of light.	0
ClaimBuster	15847				Now I've seen a good many hundreds of thousands of people who are uh - not adequately fed.	0
ClaimBuster	15848				Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering; he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him.	1
ClaimBuster	15849				And it was one of the largest declines in our history.	1
ClaimBuster	15850				Take a look at Aleppo.	0
ClaimBuster	15851				That's money in your pocket.	0
ClaimBuster	15852				I would take any action necessary to defend the treaty, Formosa, and the Pescadores Island.	0
ClaimBuster	15853				It's a good idea, they saw it, they picked it up and put it in theirs, but it's only temporary.	0
ClaimBuster	15854				Well a lot of it came from the Bakken Range in North Dakota.	1
ClaimBuster	15855				Admiral Yarnell, the commander of the Asiatic fleet, has said that these islands are not worth the bones of a single American.	1
ClaimBuster	15856				You know, over the last 20 months, you've invited me into your homes.	0
ClaimBuster	15857				And in this case we can't enhance the penalty any more than putting those three thugs to death.	0
ClaimBuster	15858				It's a great thing for companies to expand.	0
ClaimBuster	15859				If we had taken your advice Governor Romney about our auto industry, we'd be buying cars from China instead of selling cars to China.	0
ClaimBuster	15860				So what should we do?	0
ClaimBuster	15861				And I had the will of the people in my state behind me.	1
ClaimBuster	15862				We went through this tragic experience leading to World War II.	0
ClaimBuster	15863				That's big government at its best.	0
ClaimBuster	15864				We don't do anything to cut down on peak load requirements.	0
ClaimBuster	15865				I will veto anything that takes money out of Social Security for privatization or anything else other than Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	15866				We're using our steel capacity fifty-five per cent today.	1
ClaimBuster	15867				That's the kind of leadership we've shown in the region.	1
ClaimBuster	15868				Now if you uh - take the medium or middle-income taxpayer - that's about $14 thousand per person - uh - Governor Carter has indicated, publicly, in an interview that he would increase the taxes on about 50 percent of the working people of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	15869				Mr. Stone, I've had to make thousands of decisions since I've been President, serving in the Oval Office.	0
ClaimBuster	15870				Because I think that the special interests have too much power, and we need to give our democracy back to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	15871				I don't anticipate that in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	15872				And that's been the tragic story of the arms race.	0
ClaimBuster	15873				That's what Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole did, not me.	1
ClaimBuster	15874				In the past, we have not had an adequate military presence in that region.	0
ClaimBuster	15875				Our government is smaller and less bureaucratic and has given more authority to the states than its two predecessors under Republican presidents.	1
ClaimBuster	15876				Thank you, Jim; thank you, Mr. President; thank everyone for watching and listening.	0
ClaimBuster	15877				And once the border is secured, at a later date, we'll make a determination as to the rest.	0
ClaimBuster	15878				And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	15879				I mean, I'm not I don't like to get into personal matters.	0
ClaimBuster	15880				All of those are legally deductions, deductible in computing your tax, and it was a 1-year thing with him.	1
ClaimBuster	15881				And it is to that great task, if we're successful, that we will address ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	15882				And I never promoted Fannie Mae.	1
ClaimBuster	15883				He's got to raise 20,000 bucks a week to have enough money to run.	1
ClaimBuster	15884				We have ideas in the Dole-Kemp campaign and we will rescue Medicare as we did Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	15885				And I'll keep my word on the economic package.	0
ClaimBuster	15886				I think if you talk to anybody, it's not choice.	0
ClaimBuster	15887				I mean, who does that?	0
ClaimBuster	15888				That conceivably could have prevented that tragedy.	0
ClaimBuster	15889				We shouldn't do that.√É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬∞√Ç¬§ That's the kind of Vice President I want.	0
ClaimBuster	15890				But we got to have a knowledge base.	0
ClaimBuster	15891				Well, this is another fundamental difference that I have with the vice president, just as I do in the case of health care for 37 million members of working families in this country who don't have health insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	15892				She failed to get the birth certificate.	1
ClaimBuster	15893				We are going to be thriving again.	0
ClaimBuster	15894				It means help for homeowners so that they can stay in their homes.	0
ClaimBuster	15895				He has put pressure on the Congress - and I don't believe Mr. Ford would even deny this - to hold up on nonproliferation legislation until the Congress agreed for an $8 billion program for private industry to start producing enriched uranium.	1
ClaimBuster	15896				So, it does play a part in my life.	0
ClaimBuster	15897				That's why it's essential we hold the line.	0
ClaimBuster	15898				And as you know, the education cost has gone up uh - tremendously.	1
ClaimBuster	15899				But as far as underground tests for developing peaceful uses of atomic energy, we should not allow this Soviet filibuster to continue.	0
ClaimBuster	15900				Jane, there are a lot of ways to be competitive.	0
ClaimBuster	15901				Thank you, and God bless you.	0
ClaimBuster	15902				In the meantime, bin Laden is still out there.	1
ClaimBuster	15903				And this is happening on a weekly basis.	1
ClaimBuster	15904				"There's easy money out there."""	0
ClaimBuster	15905				I think that would destroy the integrity and the strength of NATO, and I am totally opposed to it.	0
ClaimBuster	15906				It is the strongest, best prepared, best equipped it has ever been.	0
ClaimBuster	15907				And then as far as other areas are concerned, I think that we have to look to presidential leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	15908				But people know where I stand.	0
ClaimBuster	15909				Not only that, but it robs this country of jobs, because instead of coming back with that million dollars and creating a shoe factory, say in New Hampshire or Vermont, if the company takes the money down to Italy and - and builds a shoe factory, they don't have to pay any taxes on the money.	0
ClaimBuster	15910				"And I said, ""I will -- I will wear his bracelet with honor."""	1
ClaimBuster	15911				And the shipment of Spruance-class destroyers to Iran are much more highly sophisticated than the Spruance-class destroyers that are present being delivered to our own Navy.	1
ClaimBuster	15912				In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st.	1
ClaimBuster	15913				In the last four years, there have been twice as many bankruptcies as new jobs created.	1
ClaimBuster	15914				There's a pipeline that runs from the Caspian through Georgia through Turkey.	1
ClaimBuster	15915				I'll never give a veto to any country over our security.	0
ClaimBuster	15916				I want to thank the League of Women Voters and the city of Louisville for hosting this evening's debate.	0
ClaimBuster	15917				I remember talking by the telephone.	1
ClaimBuster	15918				It means in my plan hiring bonuses to get 100,000 new teachers in the public schools within the next four years.	1
ClaimBuster	15919				I have, obviously, supported those efforts that the United States had to go in militarily and I have opposed that I didn't think so.	1
ClaimBuster	15920				He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine...	1
ClaimBuster	15921				You're cutting into the fiber and muscle of our conventional forces.	0
ClaimBuster	15922				If you want to hear it, you get it tomorrow night -- you'll hear it tomorrow night.	0
ClaimBuster	15923				That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan.	0
ClaimBuster	15924				We then organized the strongest coalition and the strongest sanctions against Iran in history, and it is crippling their economy.	1
ClaimBuster	15925				Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience.	0
ClaimBuster	15926				I have never advocated a Communist government for Italy.	1
ClaimBuster	15927				But when the tables get turned, I ought to do my share.	0
ClaimBuster	15928				And I've never seen such a pounding, an unfair pounding, on a young Senator in my entire life.	0
ClaimBuster	15929				That's not the way I would have done it.	0
ClaimBuster	15930				That was my first vote against tobacco companies when I said we ought to label cigarettes.	1
ClaimBuster	15931				They assumed that the uh - inflation rate was because of excessive demand and uh - therefore put into effect tight constraint on the economy, very high interest rates, which is typical also of the Republican administration, uh - tried to increase the uh - the tax uh - payments by individuals, and cut the tax payments by corporations.	1
ClaimBuster	15932				And then to let people save in an IRA and withdraw from it without a tax penalty for education, home buying or medical expenses, that's the right way to go into the 21st Century, balance the budget and cut taxes, not balloon with this $550 billion tax scheme.	0
ClaimBuster	15933				Now, many of the programs that I'm talking about - economic growth, care for the aged, development of our natural resources - build the strength of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	15934				It's going to blow a hole in the deficit It's going to raise taxes on nine million people and require bigger cuts than the one I vetoed.	0
ClaimBuster	15935				And if a few more people had gone to the polls and voted in 1968, Hubert Humphrey would have been President; Richard Nixon would not.	0
ClaimBuster	15936				Now, the most important thing we can do is to make sure that we are creating jobs in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	15937				Our foreign competitors are doing it; we're not.	1
ClaimBuster	15938				Because as we're here tonight in this debate, we are seeing, for the first time in a long time, Republicans and Democrats together, sitting down, trying to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that we're in.	1
ClaimBuster	15939				We have Iran four years closer to a nuclear bomb.	0
ClaimBuster	15940				Devastating what's happening to our inner cities.	0
ClaimBuster	15941				Every chairman of the Finance and Ways and Means Committee, Republican leaders in the Senate and the House are telling you that.	0
ClaimBuster	15942				We've got to advocate for their membership in NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	15943				Secondly, I'd take on diplomatic isolation efforts.	0
ClaimBuster	15944				I believe in self-reliance and individual initiative and risk takers being rewarded.	0
ClaimBuster	15945				And I think it's very commendable the work she's done on behalf of special needs.	0
ClaimBuster	15946				Last year, I wrote to the secretary of the Treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it.	1
ClaimBuster	15947				I was taught -- I went to a church school and I was taught that the two greatest commandments are: Love the Lord, your God, with all your mind, your body and your soul, and love your neighbor as yourself.	1
ClaimBuster	15948				Well, whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor, since you've asked it.	0
ClaimBuster	15949				Since I suggested this format I hope it's been good for all of you.	0
ClaimBuster	15950				The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies.	0
ClaimBuster	15951				We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels.	0
ClaimBuster	15952				The first president in 72 years to lose jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	15953				Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	15954				There is a tax loophole right now.	1
ClaimBuster	15955				I will release my tax returns.	0
ClaimBuster	15956				Now that was quite an admission.	0
ClaimBuster	15957				And then you can sit down and say, help me do what we should for the cities.	0
ClaimBuster	15958				"I think there's an optimism in the land and a patriotism, and I think that we're in a position once again to heed the words of Thomas Paine, who said: ""We have it in our power to begin the world over again.''"	0
ClaimBuster	15959				And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today.	0
ClaimBuster	15960				It seemed to me that if I was to uh adequately and effectively handle the problems of high inflation, a growing recession, the uh - involvement of the United States still in Vietnam that I had to give a hundred percent of my time to those two major problems.	0
ClaimBuster	15961				And we were warned 5 days before that explosives were on their way, and they weren't taken.	1
ClaimBuster	15962				Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians.	0
ClaimBuster	15963				The question again is not one of goals - we're for those goals - it's one of means.	0
ClaimBuster	15964				Would he have started a war?	0
ClaimBuster	15965				But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange.	1
ClaimBuster	15966				I'm going to make the state do this and make the state do that.	0
ClaimBuster	15967				And the proof of that is 23 million people out of work.	1
ClaimBuster	15968				He was going to break it up because he would - knew that he wasn't going to get his way on Berlin and on the other key matters with which he was concerned at the Paris Conference.	0
ClaimBuster	15969				By having a limited government and a focused government, we can send some of the money back to the people who pay the bills.	0
ClaimBuster	15970				If there are other specific areas, but beyond that I haven't gotten into any of these things, as the President knows.	0
ClaimBuster	15971				It's also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations.	0
ClaimBuster	15972				And I don't think anybody has a call on people in their Administrations going astray.	0
ClaimBuster	15973				Some of our troops are not well-equipped.	1
ClaimBuster	15974				"How could you be Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces and have some kid say -- when you have to make a tough decision, as I did in Panama or Kuwait and then have some kid jump up and say, ""Well, I'm not going to go."	0
ClaimBuster	15975				I'm going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal.	0
ClaimBuster	15976				And I lower the cost of health care in the way that I described to you.	1
ClaimBuster	15977				And -- and attacking me is not an agenda.	0
ClaimBuster	15978				Now, look, I'm just kind of a, you know, cur dog here; I was put on the ballot by the people, not special interests.	1
ClaimBuster	15979				He didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Mr. President.	1
ClaimBuster	15980				So we're not putting restraints on American exploration, we're encouraging it in every way we can.	0
ClaimBuster	15981				He says mistakes were made.	0
ClaimBuster	15982				We have peace with freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	15983				In Libya we stood on the side of the people.	1
ClaimBuster	15984				Now, Senator Obama, I'd like -- still like to know what that fine is going to be, and I don't think that Joe right now wants to pay a fine when he is seeing such difficult times in America's economy.	0
ClaimBuster	15985				He came and asked for a tax cut -- we wanted a tax cut to kick the economy into gear.	1
ClaimBuster	15986				My attitude is, if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it.	0
ClaimBuster	15987				Mr. and Mrs. America, when you hear him say we're going to tax only the rich, watch your wallet because his figures don't add up and he's going to sock it right to the middle class taxpayer and lower, if he's going to pay for all the spending programs he proposes.	1
ClaimBuster	15988				My school choice program, GI Bill for Kids, does not take public money and give it to private schools.	1
ClaimBuster	15989				And I'll stop, Tom, and you didn't even wave.	1
ClaimBuster	15990				You know, Congress passed a law called DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act.	1
ClaimBuster	15991				I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.	1
ClaimBuster	15992				I know that for many of you sitting at home, parents of kids in Iraq, you want to know who's the person who could be a commander in chief who could get your kids home and get the job done and win the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	15993				We can work with them, we can collaborate with them, if they're willing to be responsible.	0
ClaimBuster	15994				Because it's so essential to our economic strength and to our future.	0
ClaimBuster	15995				Just yesterday, I was in Toledo shaking some hands in a line.	1
ClaimBuster	15996				When you say loud and clear to somebody if you're going to carry a gun illegally, we're going to arrest you.	0
ClaimBuster	15997				This package has transparency in it.	0
ClaimBuster	15998				I can talk reasonably about life and about responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	15999				And I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	16000				You've now heard three debates, months of campaigning and way too many TV commercials.	0
ClaimBuster	16001				I ask for your support, I ask for your help.	0
ClaimBuster	16002				So the Ford administration has done a good job in helping our good ally, Israel, and we're dedicated to the survival and security of Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	16003				We have no energy policy.	1
ClaimBuster	16004				Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places.	1
ClaimBuster	16005				But in doing this, we have made sure that we address this question peacefully, not injecting American military forces into combat, but letting the strength of our nation be felt in a beneficial way.	0
ClaimBuster	16006				Candy, there's no doubt that world demand's gone up, but our production is going up, and we're using oil more efficiently.	1
ClaimBuster	16007				And I guarantee you I would not publicly state that I'm going to attack them.	0
ClaimBuster	16008				And if we stay firm and strong, we will be able to bring Cuba around as well.	0
ClaimBuster	16009				That's what I've done in Texas and that's the kind of leadership style I'll bring to Washington.	1
ClaimBuster	16010				Here's your fine -- zero.	0
ClaimBuster	16011				And if we can do that and do it in a way that gets deeper cuts on the Soviet side, which is where they ought to come from, then I think we have an opportunity over the long haul to begin to move some of our resources from the military to important domestic priorities that can provide college opportunity for that young woman whose mother wrote me from Texas just the other day, from Longview, Texas: two teachers, a mother and a father who have a child that's a freshman in college, an electrical engineering major, a very bright student and they can't afford to keep that child in college.	1
ClaimBuster	16012				We've done so in my own state.	0
ClaimBuster	16013				But I can say this: The number one responsibility of any president, above all else, is to guarantee the security of our nation - an ability to be free of the threat of attack, or blackmail and to carry out our obligations to our allies and friends, and to carry out a legitimate foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	16014				Now, everyone in the world knows that there were no weapons of mass destruction.	1
ClaimBuster	16015				It doesn't -- under the Medicare plan -- it doesn't help seniors get any better.	0
ClaimBuster	16016				Secondly, I do believe the lawsuits -- I don't believe, I know -- that the lawsuits are causing health-care costs to rise in America.	0
ClaimBuster	16017				But I'll tell you what he's going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	16018				It seems to me that the Miranda case was a case that really made it very, very difficult for the - uh police, the law enforcement people in this country to uh - do what they could to make certain that the victim of a crime was protected and that those that commit crimes uh - were properly handled and uh - sent to jail.	0
ClaimBuster	16019				This is the highest honor that I have ever had in my life, to think that somebody from Russell, Kansas, somebody who grew up living in a basement apartment, someone whose parents didn't finish high school, somebody who spent about 39 months in hospitals after World War II, someone who uses a buttonhook every day to get dressed.	1
ClaimBuster	16020				It's one of the reasons why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in the country.	1
ClaimBuster	16021				I think our troops ought to be used to fight and win war.	0
ClaimBuster	16022				Republicans and Democrats came together and said what can we do to make our public education the best in the country?	0
ClaimBuster	16023				So one of the difficulties with Iraq is that it has put an enormous strain, first of all, on our troops, obviously, and they have performed heroically and honorably and we owe them an extraordinary debt of gratitude.	0
ClaimBuster	16024				We created 23 million new jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	16025				That's what's happening in Iraq, and it wasn't a tactic.	0
ClaimBuster	16026				I'd like the government to have that.	0
ClaimBuster	16027				I'm going to get the training of Iraqis done faster.	0
ClaimBuster	16028				I believe that if we are inspired, if we can achieve a degree of unity, if we can set our goals high enough and work toward recognized goals with industry and labor and agriculture along with government at all levels, then we can achieve great things.	0
ClaimBuster	16029				"Those tapes are in the jurisdiction of the courts and I have no right to say ""yes"" or ""no."""	0
ClaimBuster	16030				They knew how to ask the American people for the right things.	0
ClaimBuster	16031				That's why I've asked you not only to examine my record, but my proposals for the future of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	16032				Well, we'll talk about the tax cut for middle class here in a minute.	0
ClaimBuster	16033				That's what works in other countries and that's what'll work here.	0
ClaimBuster	16034				Tonight I had a chance to discuss with you what to do to keep this economy going: keep the taxes low, don't increase the scope of the federal government, keep regulations down, legal reform, a health- care policy that does not empower the federal government but empowers individuals, and an energy plan that will help us become less dependent on foreign sources of energy.	0
ClaimBuster	16035				My plan does a better job.	0
ClaimBuster	16036				You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.	1
ClaimBuster	16037				In this cold war we have to recognize where it is being fought and then we have to develop programs to deal with it.	0
ClaimBuster	16038				It's all too easy for somebody in the majority in the population to say oh, we're just all the same, without an understanding of the different life experience that you've had, that others have had.	0
ClaimBuster	16039				I've proposed a plan that can capture it and contain it and clean it within four years.	0
ClaimBuster	16040				I'm sure that you know that in the resolutions passed by the Congress, that have added about $17 billion in more spending, by the Congress over the budget that I recommended.	1
ClaimBuster	16041				I'd love to be able to say to my grandchildren, four years after my first term, I'd like to say, your grandfather, working with the leaders of the Soviet Union, working with the leaders of Europe, was able to ban chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth.	0
ClaimBuster	16042				And this is not my own -- only my opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	16043				And the way you kill expansions is to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	16044				I don't know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers' money.	1
ClaimBuster	16045				That you can pass on from one generation to the next.	0
ClaimBuster	16046				These are the questions in these areas that the North and South, East and West are entitled to know.	0
ClaimBuster	16047				And after that, a number of women have come forward saying that's exactly what he did to them.	1
ClaimBuster	16048				So I don't want you to read my lips and I sure don't want you to read his.	0
ClaimBuster	16049				It cut funds to clean up toxic waste dumps with 10 million of our kids still living within four miles of a toxic waste dump, by a third.	1
ClaimBuster	16050				And, I might add, with the democratic Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	16051				We drove the Russians out with -- the Afghan freedom fighters drove the Russians out of Afghanistan, and then we made a most serious mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	16052				Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth.	0
ClaimBuster	16053				The second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down.	0
ClaimBuster	16054				We shore up the border.	0
ClaimBuster	16055				And you can go out and buy your own insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	16056				It's a matter of being consistent.	0
ClaimBuster	16057				I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere.	0
ClaimBuster	16058				I was deeply concerned about seniors having to choose between prescription drugs and food.	0
ClaimBuster	16059				That happened to be a recession year.	1
ClaimBuster	16060				No one can say what that course of action will be, but I think the next president of the United States should watch it carefully.	0
ClaimBuster	16061				And we have put significant pressure on them to make sure they're doing that; to recognize the rights of women, which is critical throughout the region.	1
ClaimBuster	16062				We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit.	1
ClaimBuster	16063				They're foreign lobbyists taking leaves.	1
ClaimBuster	16064				I said that I'd end the war in Iraq, and I did.	1
ClaimBuster	16065				I want the individuals to meet their responsibilities.	0
ClaimBuster	16066				I don't think there is a necessity to put our military in Syria at this stage.	0
ClaimBuster	16067				Here in the United States, which developed the Tennessee Valley and which built the Grand Coulee and the other dams in the Northwest United States at the present rate of hydropower production - and that is the hallmark of an industrialized society - the Soviet Union by 1975 will be producing more power than we are.	1
ClaimBuster	16068				And since I first made that proposal 15 months ago, the price of gasoline, which was then $.80, has gone up to about $1.30.	1
ClaimBuster	16069				Those people -- I don't know those people.	0
ClaimBuster	16070				The report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money.	1
ClaimBuster	16071				If you're married, you got tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	16072				We're the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	16073				There's nothing wrong with the theory of it.	0
ClaimBuster	16074				But, again, spending more money isn't always the answer.	0
ClaimBuster	16075				Ah - I'm not uh - sure that I remembered earlier that President Ford had - had expressed uh - his concern about the statement or apologized for it.	0
ClaimBuster	16076				It's got to be a timetable that all parties can agree to, like the Palestinians and Israelis.	0
ClaimBuster	16077				But I think we can take back Mosul, and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa.	0
ClaimBuster	16078				And we're going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country.	0
ClaimBuster	16079				I held off for the applause.	1
ClaimBuster	16080				I want more trade, and I know there are some good things in that agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	16081				It is true that our exports to Mexico, for example, have gone up and our trade deficit has gone down; it's also true that just today a record high trade deficit was announced with Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	16082				In the meantime, we've got challenges, for example, with China, where we are borrowing billions of dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	16083				Thank you very much tonight, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	16084				We've increased Pell Grants by a million students.	1
ClaimBuster	16085				These kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security, the well being and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age.	0
ClaimBuster	16086				And all I can tell you is every day I know that there's people working overtime, doing the very best they can.	0
ClaimBuster	16087				We had an 18 percent increase in housing starts.	1
ClaimBuster	16088				When you're attacked for your military record, I immediately said it was inappropriate, it had no place in this campaign, and I rejected it.	1
ClaimBuster	16089				At the same time, we have to make certain that the Soviet Union's Backfire, which they claim is not an intercontinental aircraft and which some of our people contend is, must also be included if we are to get the kind of agreement which is in the best interest of both countries.	0
ClaimBuster	16090				We've got to make sure that we're giving them the energy that they need or helping them to create the energy that they need.	0
ClaimBuster	16091				I don't want to see the Federal Government saying to communities, well, you can't do this any more.	0
ClaimBuster	16092				Obama draws the line in the sand.	0
ClaimBuster	16093				But you can't tell me that when the most troops any other country has on the ground is Great Britain, with 8,300, and below that the four others are below 4,000, and below that, there isn't anybody out of the hundreds, that we have a genuine coalition to get this job done.	1
ClaimBuster	16094				Let me say, first of all, Senator Dole has gone back and forth about whether he'd be for repealing the Brady Bill or repealing the assault weapons ban.	1
ClaimBuster	16095				We Republicans came to power to change government, and government changed us.	0
ClaimBuster	16096				But that there would be an answer in our lifetime is unimaginable.	0
ClaimBuster	16097				I think we should try to raise the fuel efficiency.	0
ClaimBuster	16098				Exports are down, and every time an export number goes down, it hurts the farmer.	1
ClaimBuster	16099				Uh - He sent a mission - the President - in 1955 of Mr. uh - Robertson and Admiral Radford.	1
ClaimBuster	16100				So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely.	0
ClaimBuster	16101				I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	16102				Now in that connection Senator Kennedy has criticized the President on the ground not only of not expressing regrets, but because he allowed this flight to take place while the summit conference - or immediately before the summit conference occurred.	1
ClaimBuster	16103				But they don't work if you go raise taxes and then the Congress spends it continues to spend that.	0
ClaimBuster	16104				And I suggested that, certainly, it was to their common interest, along with ours, to avoid a conflict and to attempt to save the world and remove the nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	16105				And we have to be able to give parents the same choice, frankly, that Senator Obama and Mrs. Obama had and Cindy and I had to send our kids to the school -- their kids to the school of their choice.	1
ClaimBuster	16106				We've uh - got a chance tonight to talk about, first of all, leadership, the character of our country, and a vision of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	16107				A few days later, Mr. Schlesinger came back and said if we cut the defense budget by three to five billion dollars, we will have to cut military personnel by two hundred and fifty thousand, civilian personnel by a hundred thousand, jobs in America by a hundred thousand.	1
ClaimBuster	16108				It is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical... leaders that the world has ever seen.	0
ClaimBuster	16109				That's the highest we've ever been in our country.	1
ClaimBuster	16110				Under your direction, to a large extent.	0
ClaimBuster	16111				Well, the truth of the matter is, is that that's exactly what we've done.	0
ClaimBuster	16112				Well, the bottom line is we have to stop exporting jobs here.	0
ClaimBuster	16113				Chris, we don't gain anything.	0
ClaimBuster	16114				So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.	0
ClaimBuster	16115				Teachers' salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries.	1
ClaimBuster	16116				He said all poor seniors.	1
ClaimBuster	16117				One of the reasons for that is that people think it's more attractive in some cases to go offshore than to stay here.	0
ClaimBuster	16118				I know enough about your story to admire a lot of the things that you have done as a person.	0
ClaimBuster	16119				But to continue to commit billions to this system makes no sense at all and I think Mr. Bush has been reconsidering his position over the course of the past few weeks.	0
ClaimBuster	16120				I'd like to see those written instructions.	0
ClaimBuster	16121				And my success in the primary season was, I think, notable for a newcomer, from someone who's from outside Washington, who - who never has been a part of the Washington establishment.	0
ClaimBuster	16122				I don't take credit for all the good things that have happened in America, but I take credit for what I've tried to do to work with others to make good things happen.	0
ClaimBuster	16123				Now, here's what that means.	0
ClaimBuster	16124				Well, every time Donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable, like what these women are saying, he immediately goes to denying responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	16125				But if our government itself is doing business with people who we know are engaged in drug profiteering and drug trafficking, if we don't understand that that sends out a very, very bad message to our young people, it's a little difficult for me to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that I talked about and to young people like her all over the country, and say to them we want to help you.	0
ClaimBuster	16126				We have not known what we've wanted and we've been out-traded in almost every instance.	0
ClaimBuster	16127				I do not say that.	0
ClaimBuster	16128				So I don't think they ought to look at us in any way other than what we are.	0
ClaimBuster	16129				I supported them when they did so.	1
ClaimBuster	16130				I don't disagree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	16131				Look, this is a man who has great numbers.	0
ClaimBuster	16132				In Texas I tried to do something innovative.	0
ClaimBuster	16133				And it's not that simple, either.	0
ClaimBuster	16134				What did we get for it?	0
ClaimBuster	16135				I'll be against it after the election.	0
ClaimBuster	16136				But are we doing enough in these areas?	0
ClaimBuster	16137				So what I've said is we need to fix a broken immigration system and I've done everything that I can on my own and sought cooperation from Congress to make sure that we fix the system.	1
ClaimBuster	16138				And peace comes to the country, and prosperity.	0
ClaimBuster	16139				And I think Americans will judge very seriously as to whether that's the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	16140				I remember when Alf Landon was against Social Security and uh - later President Nixon, sixteen years ago, was telling the public that John Kennedy's proposals would bankrupt the country and would double the cost.	1
ClaimBuster	16141				And that's the kind of America I want to build.	0
ClaimBuster	16142				... advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia.	1
ClaimBuster	16143				Uh - Mr. Maynard, uh - the record of gun control, whether it's one city or another or in some states, does not show that the registration of a gun, handgun, or the registration of the gun owner, has in any way whatsoever decreased the crime rate or the use of that gun in the committing of a crime.	1
ClaimBuster	16144				Now, you know, watch this -- listen very carefully to this.	0
ClaimBuster	16145				"So when you hear ""tax the rich,"" Mr. and Mrs. America, watch your wallet."	0
ClaimBuster	16146				My answer is that this campaign isn't over yet.	0
ClaimBuster	16147				... talking about it this evening.	0
ClaimBuster	16148				But when it comes to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere.	1
ClaimBuster	16149				What I think is most important is that we recognize that to solve the key problems that we're facing, if we're going to solve two wars, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, if we can -- if we're going to focus on lifting wages that have declined over the last eight years and create jobs here in America, then Democrats, independents and Republicans, we're going to have to be able to work together.	0
ClaimBuster	16150				It has not worked the way that it has been promised.	1
ClaimBuster	16151				But the fact is, we're going to help Americans be able to buy into it.	0
ClaimBuster	16152				The net result is we are going to have some improvement in our receipts.	0
ClaimBuster	16153				And I'll just make you one promise, my word is good.	0
ClaimBuster	16154				We're going to have conventional forces that are well maintained, well equipped, well trained, well supported.	0
ClaimBuster	16155				we'd be in a stronger place today.	0
ClaimBuster	16156				I could give better examples, but for - for whatever it is, whether it's in the field of housing, or health, or medical care, or schools, or the eh- development of electric power, we have programs which we believe will move America, move her forward and build on the wonderful record that we have made over these past seven and a half years.	0
ClaimBuster	16157				I would strengthen the Development Loan Fund.	0
ClaimBuster	16158				Obviously small business people want to give their employees health insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	16159				If we don't build more B-2 bombers in California and we lost about 500,000 jobs out in California, because of this devastation, these big, big cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	16160				The policies of the last four years have seen incomes in America decline every year for middle income families, now down $4,300 during your term.	1
ClaimBuster	16161				And if they should be in error slightly on the down side, then I'll phase in the programs that we've uh - advocated, more slowly.	0
ClaimBuster	16162				But it's like his plan to defeat ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	16163				My plan to get the industry on its feet when it was in real trouble was not to start writing checks.	0
ClaimBuster	16164				Let me very briefly give you some examples.	0
ClaimBuster	16165				The fact is that the State Department polls on our prestige and influence around the world have shown such a sharp drop that up till now the State Department has been unwilling to release them.	1
ClaimBuster	16166				If we move into a recession in sixty-one, then I would agree that we have to put more money into the economy, and it can be done by either one of the two methods discussed.	0
ClaimBuster	16167				I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain.	0
ClaimBuster	16168				Let me say -- I certainly hope so.	0
ClaimBuster	16169				Number two, Mr. President, the reason I call it an apology tour is because you went to the Middle East and you flew to Egypt and to Saudi Arabia and to Turkey and Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	16170				So we have a big difference on this trickle down theory.	0
ClaimBuster	16171				The Japanese, the British, the French do it.	1
ClaimBuster	16172				You see that, their small car division leaving.	1
ClaimBuster	16173				Yes, we're getting the job done.	1
ClaimBuster	16174				What I'm referring to there is the mutual self-defense provisions that exist in the Inter-American treaty, the so-called Rio Pact, that permits the nations, our friends in that region, to combine to take steps -- diplomatic and otherwise -- to prevent Nicaragua, when she acts irresponsibly in asserting power in other parts outside of her border, to take those steps, whatever they might be, to stop it.	1
ClaimBuster	16175				Now, that's another thing for you to think about when you go home tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	16176				And let's set the record straight right now by looking at the record, as Al Smith used to say.	0
ClaimBuster	16177				And that's just the way it is.	0
ClaimBuster	16178				His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald.	0
ClaimBuster	16179				I think one of the lessons in between World War I and World War II is we let our military atrophy.	0
ClaimBuster	16180				I think pure research and development investment on the part of the United States government is certainly appropriate.	0
ClaimBuster	16181				Beyond that, as far as the gold supply is concerned, and as far as the movement of gold is concerned, uh - we have to bear in mind that we must get more help from our allies abroad in this great venture in which all free men are involved of winning the battle for freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	16182				I have favored our programs abroad for economic assistance and for military assistance.	1
ClaimBuster	16183				If you create Noriega, using taxpayer money, step up to the plate and say it was a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	16184				Governor Reagan's proposal, the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal, is one of the most highly inflationary ideas that ever has been presented to the American public.	0
ClaimBuster	16185				Textiles, shoes, things like that that we say are yesterday's industries.	0
ClaimBuster	16186				We have achieved extraordinary prosperity.	0
ClaimBuster	16187				But to the issue of Iran, as long as I'm president of the United States Iran will not get a nuclear weapon.	1
ClaimBuster	16188				Then get off to a flying start in '93 to execute these plans.	0
ClaimBuster	16189				They have been short-changed as we have taken ten million taxpayers off the tax rolls in the last eight years, and as we have uh - added to the minimum tax uh - provision to make all people pay more taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	16190				China, is a huge country, broken into many provinces.	1
ClaimBuster	16191				And all of a sudden the results of having no plan have caught up with America.	0
ClaimBuster	16192				Well, Terry, first of all, we honor your service, and we're grateful for it.	0
ClaimBuster	16193				That's the most important part of this.	0
ClaimBuster	16194				I want anti-ballistic missile systems to protect ourselves and our allies from a rogue nation that may try to hold us hostage or blackmail our allies and friends.	0
ClaimBuster	16195				What about the Dingle-Norwood bill?	0
ClaimBuster	16196				Again, I can't tell you how big a mistake I think that is, to have bilateral talks with North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	16197				And a lot of times there are powerful forces that are against you.	0
ClaimBuster	16198				We will fight the terrorists around the world so we do not have to face them here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	16199				I saw the winds of hatred divide people and keep the people of my state poorer than they would have been, spiritually and economically.	0
ClaimBuster	16200				You know, that's a tough question and there's a lot of qualified Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	16201				I believe, as the president indicated, and said at the time that I supported his -- his action there.	1
ClaimBuster	16202				And I don't mean you, Mr. President, but some people in the -- in our nation feel that Pakistan is being nice to us, and that we should walk away fro mthem.	0
ClaimBuster	16203				That was their response to that sort of action.	0
ClaimBuster	16204				That's wonderful, except we have a record to look at.	0
ClaimBuster	16205				We don't know what the world is going to throw at us down the road.	0
ClaimBuster	16206				And during that period about 3,000 young kids every day started smoking.	1
ClaimBuster	16207				And I'm happy to tell you that we have.	0
ClaimBuster	16208				And why have they lost their industry?	0
ClaimBuster	16209				And I've got two daughters and I want to make sure that they have the same opportunities that anybody's sons have.	1
ClaimBuster	16210				More than 90% of America's children go to public schools.	1
ClaimBuster	16211				"And then 5 days before the troops were killed, they went back to the President, through the Secretary of Defense, and said, ""Please, Mr. President, take those troops out of there because we can't defend them.''"	1
ClaimBuster	16212				I'm against the partial-birth abortion, but you've got to have an exception for the life of the mother and the health of the mother under the strictest test of bodily injury to the mother.	0
ClaimBuster	16213				I think we've had a very healthy discussion.	0
ClaimBuster	16214				I, too, want to extend my prayers and blessings, God's blessings on the families whose lives were overturned yes -- tod -- last night.	0
ClaimBuster	16215				For the last eight years I have had the challenge of running the streamlining program called Reinventing Government.	1
ClaimBuster	16216				People who had the money were benefiting.	0
ClaimBuster	16217				The extremes are hurting the AIDS cause.	0
ClaimBuster	16218				Because freedom took hold in that part of the world, but there's a lot of work left to be done, however.	0
ClaimBuster	16219				In fact, independent studies have looked at our respective plans and have concluded that I provide three times the amount of tax relief to middle-class families than Senator McCain does.	1
ClaimBuster	16220				And, Senator Obama, you didn't repudiate those remarks.	1
ClaimBuster	16221				Well, these special kinds of programs have - have robbed the average taxpayer and have benefited those who are powerful, and who can employ lobbyists, and who can have their CPAs and their lawyers to help them benefit from the roughly uh - eight thousand pages of the tax code.	1
ClaimBuster	16222				That's my big difference with him on the draft.	1
ClaimBuster	16223				Let me give you one example.	0
ClaimBuster	16224				"And I said, ""Well, gosh, can't we -- can't we find some -- some women that are also qualified?"""	0
ClaimBuster	16225				My administration has tripled the amount of money we're spending on homeland security to $30 billion a year.	1
ClaimBuster	16226				They had thirty-five people on the list.	1
ClaimBuster	16227				Well, there were some good pictures, but does it fall into that category?	0
ClaimBuster	16228				This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	16229				And I have a lot of young people work in my office, work in my campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	16230				And one thing that the president said, which I want to make sure that we understand, he said that I said we should take Detroit bankrupt.	1
ClaimBuster	16231				Right now there's a peacekeeping force that has been set up and we have African Union troops in Darfur to stop a genocide that has killed hundreds of thousands of people.	1
ClaimBuster	16232				I've met people who struggled with this for years, people who were in a marriage because they were living a sort of convention, and they struggled with it.	0
ClaimBuster	16233				We have access to facilities in five different areas of that region.	1
ClaimBuster	16234				We've doubled the number of loans from the small business administration, tripled the number of loans to women business people, no one unqualified, everybody had to meet the standards.	1
ClaimBuster	16235				We've got to have a package of reforms and it has got to lead to reform prosperity and peace in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	16236				I don't believe in trying to legislate new tests for the selection of the Federal Judiciary.	0
ClaimBuster	16237				And as a consequence, what we've been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans.	1
ClaimBuster	16238				I went down there and talked to the president of Panama about cleaning up their money laundering, and Mr. Noriega was there, but there was no evidence at that time, and when the evidence was there, we indicted him.	1
ClaimBuster	16239				It ended the principle that the polluters should pay for those toxic waste dumps unless it was very recent.	1
ClaimBuster	16240				The American people would be in charge.	0
ClaimBuster	16241				It has also the benefit of allowing citizens to participate in the process.	0
ClaimBuster	16242				I'd like to answer the question, because I've actually been a governor for 12 years, so I've known a lot of people who have lost their jobs because of jobs moving overseas, and I know a lot of people whose plants have been strengthened by increasing exports.	1
ClaimBuster	16243				You know, if you are a country and you're trying to gain the support of another country, then you want to do everything you can that they would act in a cooperative fashion.	0
ClaimBuster	16244				Like the old carpenter says measure twice, cut once.	0
ClaimBuster	16245				Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years.	1
ClaimBuster	16246				I don't want to hurt their feelings on national TV.	0
ClaimBuster	16247				It's the hardest decision a president makes.	0
ClaimBuster	16248				And that's the kind of America I want.	0
ClaimBuster	16249				"And the last conversation she had with her father was him calling from the twin towers, saying ""Peyton (ph), I love you and I will always watch over you."""	1
ClaimBuster	16250				In fact, women's wages have dropped 2.2 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	16251				We have came out of the recession and we're well on the road to real prosperity in this country again.	0
ClaimBuster	16252				We now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control.	1
ClaimBuster	16253				I've been known to mangle a syl-a-ble or two myself, you know, if you know what I mean.	1
ClaimBuster	16254				Secondly, the surest way to bust this economy is to increase the role and size of the federal budget.	0
ClaimBuster	16255				And finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, I'm not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the -- the revenues going to the government.	0
ClaimBuster	16256				I think the President has done some things to raise the sense of spirit, morale, good feeling in this country, and he's entitled to credit for that.	0
ClaimBuster	16257				The Soviet Union and the Communist-dominated government of Iraq are neighbors of Iran, and Iran is an ally of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	16258				I would not agree to any agreement in which the United States security interest was not fully recognized and supported.	0
ClaimBuster	16259				Just no hedges, no ifs, ands and buts.	0
ClaimBuster	16260				I want to do those two things and get this -- get this to a balanced budget with eight -- eight to 10 years.	0
ClaimBuster	16261				I know that throughout my life this has made a difference to me.	0
ClaimBuster	16262				What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women.	1
ClaimBuster	16263				So Governor Clinton can label it tax for the rich or anything he wants.	0
ClaimBuster	16264				Today it is up a plus 4 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	16265				I served an a hospital authority.	1
ClaimBuster	16266				One of the serious problems, hear me well, is that our system of government is being undermined by too much influence coming from special interest money.	0
ClaimBuster	16267				Everybody ought to be in this thing.	0
ClaimBuster	16268				And we've -- you know, Senator McCain and I have some fundamental disagreements on the economy, starting with Senator McCain's statement earlier that he thought the fundamentals of the economy were sound.	1
ClaimBuster	16269				And I've stood up with these people, and I understand what you have to do to be strong in this situation, and it's moving, not as fast as we'd like.	0
ClaimBuster	16270				And I am convinced we need to do a lot of things.	0
ClaimBuster	16271				Thank you to Lynn University for welcoming us here.	0
ClaimBuster	16272				And what is he going to say to those people that show up at the summit?	0
ClaimBuster	16273				Number three, I'm going to get us to a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	16274				Because they felt that the American society was moving again.	0
ClaimBuster	16275				In fact it makes it less likely for them to come here...	0
ClaimBuster	16276				"The mistake that was made was making the ""read my lips"" promise in the first place just to get elected, knowing what the size of the deficit was."	0
ClaimBuster	16277				I'd like to say to Mr. Bush, even though I've got profound differences with him, I do honor his service to our country.	0
ClaimBuster	16278				You know, I was having lunch with some -- a veteran in Minnesota who had been a medic dealing with the most extreme circumstances.	1
ClaimBuster	16279				They end up being worse than the people.	0
ClaimBuster	16280				I thought the President did the right thing with Mexico and was very strongly supportive of the administration in Mexico.	0
ClaimBuster	16281				One of the reasons I'm such a strong believer in legal reform is so that people aren't afraid of producing a product that is necessary for the health of our citizens and then end up getting sued in a court of law.	0
ClaimBuster	16282				Well I understood that this was the Eisenhower-Nixon Administration according to all the Republican uh - propaganda that I've read.	1
ClaimBuster	16283				We're doing that precisely, and I think one thing sooner or later we're going to have to consider is take a look at the Social Security system.	0
ClaimBuster	16284				Look at the record and make your decision.	0
ClaimBuster	16285				These are reasonable ways to help promote a culture of life in America.	0
ClaimBuster	16286				So, the plan that we have had and that we are following is a plan that is based on growth in the economy, recovery without inflation, and reducing the share that the Government is taking from the gross national product, which has become a drag on the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	16287				We also want to say that insofar as is humanly possible the banking industry itself should pay for the cost of any bank failures; the taxpayers should not.	0
ClaimBuster	16288				Look, I'm very proud of my vice presidential selection, Joe Biden, who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and as he explains, and as John well knows, the issues of Afghanistan, the issues of Iraq, critical issues like that, don't go through my subcommittee because they're done as a committee as a whole.	1
ClaimBuster	16289				If we're going to have follow-ups, then I will want follow-ups, as well.	0
ClaimBuster	16290				But the point is -- the point is, we have finally seen Republicans and Democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package.	1
ClaimBuster	16291				We don't want another Iraq, we don't want another Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	16292				And a majority in every country except Greece, felt that it would be the Soviet Union by l970.	1
ClaimBuster	16293				This would mean the resumption of a very dangerous nuclear arms race.	0
ClaimBuster	16294				"And if I were to ever say, ""This is the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place,"" the troops would wonder, how can I follow this guy?"	0
ClaimBuster	16295				And we certainly need to adjust the certain loan eligibility to inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	16296				I think the people should put America first, rather than party first.	0
ClaimBuster	16297				And the interesting place-one of the things that fascinates me about this perestroika and glasnost is wheats going to happen in Eastern Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	16298				Police officers are being cut from the streets of America because the president decided to cut the COPS program.	1
ClaimBuster	16299				But we do have differences.	0
ClaimBuster	16300				I have voted for alternate fuel all of my time...	1
ClaimBuster	16301				They have 270 billion dollars in Medicare cuts the first education cuts in history, cut environmental enforcement by 25 percent, took away the guarantee of quality standards in nursing homes, took away the guarantee of health care for folks with disabilities.	1
ClaimBuster	16302				It brought the crime rate way down.	1
ClaimBuster	16303				Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.	0
ClaimBuster	16304				Obviously the president and I both have very strong convictions.	0
ClaimBuster	16305				And then I went down to the border towns of Storok (ph), which had experienced missiles raining dowm from Hamas.	1
ClaimBuster	16306				You can't take different positions on these difficult issues.	0
ClaimBuster	16307				I voted for border security, and there are...	1
ClaimBuster	16308				So let's not raise anybody's taxes, my friends, and make it be very clear to you I am not in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy.	0
ClaimBuster	16309				That's what I feel passionately about.	0
ClaimBuster	16310				To me that's what it's all about.	0
ClaimBuster	16311				We have to both bring down the deficit and get our economy going through these kinds of investments in order to get the kind of wealth and jobs and incomes we need in America.	0
ClaimBuster	16312				We are the ones that lowered the barrier to products with Carla Hill's negotiation.	1
ClaimBuster	16313				And only one in 20 students would be eligible for these vouchers, and they wouldn't even pay the full tuition to private school.	1
ClaimBuster	16314				It is absolutely essential in terms of bringing our banking system and credit system into the new age instead of having it living back in the dark ages.	0
ClaimBuster	16315				What about the other 15,000?	0
ClaimBuster	16316				But the military -- let's get back to the military, though.	0
ClaimBuster	16317				We're a freedom-loving nation and if we're an arrogant nation they'll view us that way, but if we're a humble nation they'll respect us.	0
ClaimBuster	16318				I've met parents who've on the Internet gotten the armor to send their kids.	1
ClaimBuster	16319				There have been preliminary skirmishing in the committees of the Senate, but the Treaty has never come to the floor of the Senate for either a debate or a vote.	1
ClaimBuster	16320				But what is also important for us to understand is, is that for America to be successful in this region there's some things that we're going to have to do here at home as well.	0
ClaimBuster	16321				Now you listed some things - the uh - deferral on foreign income as estimated: that would save about $500 million.	1
ClaimBuster	16322				They have done a brilliant job, and General Petraeus has done a brilliant job.	0
ClaimBuster	16323				Also, we'll never be strong again overseas, unless we're strong at home.	0
ClaimBuster	16324				You know what the bad news is that follows on that.	0
ClaimBuster	16325				And we provide a 50 percent tax credit so that they can buy health insurance for their workers, because there are an awful lot of small businesses that I meet across America that want to do right by their workers but they just can't afford it.	1
ClaimBuster	16326				It's easy to say in retrospect I would have done something differently.	0
ClaimBuster	16327				Not what a commander in chief does when you're trying to lead troops.	0
ClaimBuster	16328				In addition, I believe the next president in January and February should go to work in building the strength of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	16329				I don't think we ought to reward illegal behavior.	0
ClaimBuster	16330				Well, Margaret, we've heard it again tonight and I'm not surprised, the labels.	0
ClaimBuster	16331				Another thing that I'd like to say is this: In our international trade, as I said in my op- opening statement, we have become the arms merchant of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	16332				They're not going to follow an American president who says follow me into a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	16333				We're going to defeat ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	16334				But I certainly will support the outcome of this election.	0
ClaimBuster	16335				Well, I've been governor of a small state for 12 years.	1
ClaimBuster	16336				You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina.	0
ClaimBuster	16337				No, it's not time to divorce a nation on Earth that has 100 nuclear weapons and is on the way to double that at some point, a nation that has serious threats from terrorist groups within its nation, as I indicated before, the Taliban, Haqqani Network.	1
ClaimBuster	16338				Your question -- your question is one that's being asked by college kids all over this country.	1
ClaimBuster	16339				Did they occur when you were a young person, in your formative years?	0
ClaimBuster	16340				But we have to prove we can pay for them.	0
ClaimBuster	16341				My plan balances the budget within 6 years.	1
ClaimBuster	16342				The best America doesn't leave some of its citizens behind.	0
ClaimBuster	16343				This, to me, is a very important difference between him and me in this election, and I believe the American people will judge accordingly.	0
ClaimBuster	16344				I think all of us should have a respect for innocent life.	0
ClaimBuster	16345				I just thought of another -- another big difference here between me.	0
ClaimBuster	16346				I think it can be.	0
ClaimBuster	16347				It's time for a new administration to deal with the energy problem.	0
ClaimBuster	16348				And, finally, we have to stand by our principles.	0
ClaimBuster	16349				I think we have to come together and work to change it.	0
ClaimBuster	16350				And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what's happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she's going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she's -- he's just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama.	1
ClaimBuster	16351				Now, one thing I don't understand, Jim, is why is it that the wealthiest 1% get their tax cuts the first year, but 95% of seniors have to wait four to five years before they get a single penny?	1
ClaimBuster	16352				The President held it up.	1
ClaimBuster	16353				But if somebody -- and I'll ask the press -- if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started.	0
ClaimBuster	16354				If the American people cannot be brought together, we can't turn this country around.	0
ClaimBuster	16355				You don't finance long-term debt with short-term money.	0
ClaimBuster	16356				We've got to anticipate some of these problems ahead of time.	0
ClaimBuster	16357				But there are other folks out there.	0
ClaimBuster	16358				Now, I don't want to get into that --	0
ClaimBuster	16359				"And President Bush did some smart things at the outset, but one of the opportunities that was missed was, when he spoke to the American people, he said, ""Go out and shop."""	1
ClaimBuster	16360				He said in his speech he wants to make sure the right people get tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	16361				Didn't close off the borders.	0
ClaimBuster	16362				When this Republican administration came into office we were shipping about $1 billion worth of arms overseas, now ten to twelve billion dollars worth of arms overseas to countries that quite often use these weapons to fight each other.	1
ClaimBuster	16363				I'd like to thank the people of St. Louis and Washington University, the Presidential Debate Commission and all those who made this night possible.	0
ClaimBuster	16364				More money goes to the -- can I have a rebuttal here?	0
ClaimBuster	16365				So this is a national security issue.	0
ClaimBuster	16366				It was very clear this was not a demonstration.	0
ClaimBuster	16367				And if they -- if they find that -- that they can't get the benefits here that they want and they can't -- and they can't find the job they want, then they'll make a decision to go a place where -- where they have better opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	16368				Our commanders have got all the flexibility to do what is necessary to succeed.	1
ClaimBuster	16369				And you know, Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment.	1
ClaimBuster	16370				I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.	0
ClaimBuster	16371				Because there's no way you can finance what you want to spend.	0
ClaimBuster	16372				We also wanted Medicare to be able to negotiate bulk purchasing.	1
ClaimBuster	16373				Under -- under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up.	0
ClaimBuster	16374				It is to fully fund the McKinney Act.	0
ClaimBuster	16375				It has begun to decline, but it is still going up.	1
ClaimBuster	16376				But the White House staff increased its expenditures by considerably more than Congress has in the last 4 years under the Bush administration, and Congress has actually spent a billion dollars less than President Bush asked them to spend.	1
ClaimBuster	16377				That's for the uh - proper authorities who have control over those tapes to make that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	16378				Well, I cannot see where a $.50 a gallon tax applied to gasoline would have changed the price of gasoline.	0
ClaimBuster	16379				Senator Kennedy and I are candidates for the presidency of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	16380				As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life.	0
ClaimBuster	16381				And finally, we don't want to have military involvement there.	1
ClaimBuster	16382				Will they create jobs in America?	0
ClaimBuster	16383				I think we were right to pass the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, which says you can't lose your health insurance just because you change jobs or because someone in your family's been sick.	1
ClaimBuster	16384				But America cannot stand pat.	0
ClaimBuster	16385				And over the long run they will be more reliable partners.	0
ClaimBuster	16386				But in the presidency, a lot goes into it.	0
ClaimBuster	16387				And she worked hard every day and made a lot of sacrifices to make sure we got everything we needed.	0
ClaimBuster	16388				Democrats and Republicans said Bob Dole's word is good.	1
ClaimBuster	16389				And my judgment is that they don't want to give their freedom up to become Communists.	0
ClaimBuster	16390				This is not my best friend.	0
ClaimBuster	16391				So to answer your question, it requires a clear vision, a willingness to stand by our friends, and the credibility for people both friend and foe to understand when America says something, we mean it.	0
ClaimBuster	16392				You know, a lot of you remember the tragedy of 9/11 and where you were on that day and, you know, how all of the country was ready to come together and make enormous changes to make us not only safer, but to make us a better country and a more unified country.	0
ClaimBuster	16393				And, yes, I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives.	1
ClaimBuster	16394				When you're president of the US, you cannot have this pattern of saying well, I'm for it but I'm on the other side of it.	0
ClaimBuster	16395				Because it's gotten a little ugly out there.	0
ClaimBuster	16396				But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have.	1
ClaimBuster	16397				Before I was sworn in, the policy of this government was to have bilateral negotiations with North Korea.	1
ClaimBuster	16398				That's why we're bringing Al Qaida to justice.	0
ClaimBuster	16399				Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard.	0
ClaimBuster	16400				No other nation would have cut defense as much as we already have without that.	0
ClaimBuster	16401				Is it in our nation's interests?	0
ClaimBuster	16402				It's going to increase revenues to the federal government, and it's going to create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	16403				But it's important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top.	0
ClaimBuster	16404				Will we have equal opportunity?	0
ClaimBuster	16405				I have roundly condemned those acts.	1
ClaimBuster	16406				Every plan that I have laid out -- my health-care plan, my plan for education, my plan for kids to be able to get better college loans -- I've shown exactly how I'm going to pay for those.	1
ClaimBuster	16407				The president has tried, but his policies haven't worked.	0
ClaimBuster	16408				And I think this shows a callous indifference to the families that have suffered so much.	0
ClaimBuster	16409				Until about five months ago the Japanese economy was in a deep recession.	1
ClaimBuster	16410				I know it's tough and honest people can disagree.	0
ClaimBuster	16411				Those are the -- the cornerstones of my plan.	0
ClaimBuster	16412				This economy is starting to run downhill.	0
ClaimBuster	16413				If you're a family of four making $50,000 in Missouri, you get a 50% cut in your federal income taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	16414				It seems to me that in this election, the focus should not be on the executive branch but the corrections should come as the voters vote for their members of the House of Representatives or for their United States senator.	0
ClaimBuster	16415				Well, one thing I did was oppose the government takeover health care that President Clinton offered in 1993, which created 17 new taxes and 50 new bureaucracies and price controls, because we were afraid the very thing you mentioned would have happened.	1
ClaimBuster	16416				There's no ceasefire in Bosnia.	1
ClaimBuster	16417				And that's the way it's always been, and that's the way it always will be.	0
ClaimBuster	16418				One of the key tests of leadership is whether one sees clearly the nature of the problems confronted by our nation.	0
ClaimBuster	16419				But it asked the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more.	1
ClaimBuster	16420				wouldn't it be nice to be the ice man so you never make a mistake?	0
ClaimBuster	16421				And it was a smart move because there's gas reserves up there.	1
ClaimBuster	16422				The problem we have today is like the patient's bill of rights, particularly with health care, there's a lot of bickering in Washington, D.C.	0
ClaimBuster	16423				... it just shows you're not up to doing the job.	0
ClaimBuster	16424				And I want to make sure that the next generation has those same opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	16425				And I simply don't believe we can afford nor do we need to keep 150,000 troops in Europe given how much the Red Army, now under the control of Russia, has been cut, the arms control agreement concluded between Mr. Bush and Mr. Yeltsin, something I have applauded.	1
ClaimBuster	16426				Our education system can be improved.	0
ClaimBuster	16427				"They don't like the use of the word, but may I remind his strong supporters that only last year in the primary, to capture that Democratic nomination, he said, ""I am a progressive liberal Democrat."""	1
ClaimBuster	16428				It may be because of our experiences.	0
ClaimBuster	16429				I do think there are special experiences and judgments and backgrounds and understandings that women bring to this process, by the way.	0
ClaimBuster	16430				Our country is so, so -- it's just so imperative that we have the right justices.	0
ClaimBuster	16431				And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy.	0
ClaimBuster	16432				Now, that ought to get everybody back up to let's get along together and make it work.	0
ClaimBuster	16433				That's one of the things I want to change.	0
ClaimBuster	16434				You know, under my leadership, what we've done is reformed education, working with governors, 46 states.	1
ClaimBuster	16435				Of course, we're paying attention to these.	0
ClaimBuster	16436				What kind of America do you want to have for yourself and for your children.	0
ClaimBuster	16437				Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	16438				This seems to me is criticism that again is wrong on his part.	0
ClaimBuster	16439				And it's estimated that that will create 800,000 new jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	16440				And our team of -- our country's team over there did a great job.	0
ClaimBuster	16441				The secretary of state has made better than fifty speeches all over the United States explaining American foreign policy.	1
ClaimBuster	16442				Because there -- there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	16443				Let me give you some advice.	0
ClaimBuster	16444				First I want to compliment the governor on his response to those fires and floods in Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	16445				Well, I've never, ever used the harshest word, as you did just then.	1
ClaimBuster	16446				That is not who America is.	0
ClaimBuster	16447				A lot of people are busy and it's hard for them to just get there and vote.	0
ClaimBuster	16448				There's no way to make a prediction that my family might be able to own a home or to put my kid through college.	0
ClaimBuster	16449				I see the valley below, and it's a valley of peace.	0
ClaimBuster	16450				You know how I know?	0
ClaimBuster	16451				I think it's a matter that we should continue to uh - give uh - great care and attention to.	0
ClaimBuster	16452				Drugs are pouring in through the border.	1
ClaimBuster	16453				And then the war was very badly mishandled.	0
ClaimBuster	16454				And we're going to make America wealthy again, because if you don't do that, it just -- it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.	0
ClaimBuster	16455				Each one of those jobs would've cost the taxpayers $25 thousand.	0
ClaimBuster	16456				One of them happened just the other day, when a man I admire and respect -- I've written about him -- Congressman John Lewis, an American hero, made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter in American history, segregation, deaths of children in church bombings, George Wallace.	1
ClaimBuster	16457				In the last uh - two weeks, I've had a chance to talk to uh - two men who have visited uh - the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and China.	1
ClaimBuster	16458				I need to be able to get home at 5 o'clock so I can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school.	1
ClaimBuster	16459				We now have a $2.6 trillion deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	16460				What I worry about with the president is that he's not acknowledging what's on the ground, he's not acknowledging the realities of North Korea, he's not acknowledging the truth of the science of stem-cell research or of global warming and other issues.	1
ClaimBuster	16461				I will say this: in the event that such an attack occurred and in the event the attack was a prelude to an attack on Formosa - which would be the indication today because the Chinese Communists say over and over again that their objective is not the offshore islands, that they consider them only steppingstones to taking Formosa - in the event that their attack then were a prelude to an attack on Formosa, there isn't any question but that the United States would then again, as in the case of Berlin, honor our treaty obligations and stand by our ally of Formosa.	1
ClaimBuster	16462				We need a new military and a new national security policy equal to the challenges of a post cold war era, a smaller permanent military force, but one that is more mobile, well trained with high technology equipment.	0
ClaimBuster	16463				And they got the ultimate punishment.	1
ClaimBuster	16464				And one final comment, uh - Governor Carter talks about the tax bills and all of the inequities that exist in the present law.	1
ClaimBuster	16465				So in my judgment we would spend more money in this Administration on aid to education, we'd spend more money on housing, we'd spend more money and I hope more wisely on defense than this Administration has.	0
ClaimBuster	16466				It will help you in whatever you're going to do in the next few years.	0
ClaimBuster	16467				I want to see the McKinney Act fully funded.	0
ClaimBuster	16468				Now Senator Kennedy a moment ago referred to the fact that there was not an adequate Voice of America program for Latin America.	1
ClaimBuster	16469				Governor Carter apparently doesn't know the facts.	0
ClaimBuster	16470				China may have it by 1963, Egypt.	0
ClaimBuster	16471				Culture of life is really important for a country to have if it's going to be a hospitable society.	0
ClaimBuster	16472				And there's a lot of good people working hard.	0
ClaimBuster	16473				But I also believe something else about that.	0
ClaimBuster	16474				It was only when the Supreme Court handed down a decision that the Federal Government intervened in what had always been a State policy.	1
ClaimBuster	16475				My attitude is you ain't seen nothing yet.	0
ClaimBuster	16476				Now what do the Chinese Communists want?	0
ClaimBuster	16477				Nobody should have any doubt about that, least of all our adversaries or potential adversaries.	0
ClaimBuster	16478				And then, after it worked, I was told that lowering taxes would increase inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	16479				Secondly, there have been statements made that uh - the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	16480				Your your Social Security is going to be there when you retire.	0
ClaimBuster	16481				That's why I want to continue the work we have done over partisan opposition, to work with communities to bring that crime rate down until our streets are all safe again.	0
ClaimBuster	16482				I know how the do that, my friends.	0
ClaimBuster	16483				I want to close loopholes that allow companies to deduct expenses when they move to China; that allow them to profit offshore and not have to get taxed, so they have tax advantages offshore.	1
ClaimBuster	16484				If those two powers should split, it could have great effects throughout the entire world.	0
ClaimBuster	16485				I was up in New Hampshire the other day.	1
ClaimBuster	16486				And if you pass the big drug companies' bill, nothing will happen.	0
ClaimBuster	16487				Our nation needs to be credible and strong.	0
ClaimBuster	16488				I applaud them for it, I don't criticize them.	0
ClaimBuster	16489				And when they meet, that is a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	16490				I was responsible for the amendment with Senator Monroney in 1954 to strengthen our ground forces.	1
ClaimBuster	16491				We're putting more money per child into education, and we are not performing as we should.	1
ClaimBuster	16492				America stands tall again, and as a result, we are credible.	0
ClaimBuster	16493				Why that's more than the average teacher makes.	1
ClaimBuster	16494				He's a dear and beloved friend to all of us.	0
ClaimBuster	16495				Is this a war-torn country?	0
ClaimBuster	16496				The minimum wage is the lowest minimum wage value it has been in our nation in 50 years.	1
ClaimBuster	16497				They know that she's a role model to women and other -- and reformers all over America.	0
ClaimBuster	16498				I want competition and I want to pool the insurance and take care of it that way and have -- oh, here's the other point.	0
ClaimBuster	16499				I'm looking for judges -- and I've actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	16500				I have a simple philosophy that I tried to follow for the last four years: Do what creates opportunity for all, what reinforces responsibility from all of us, and what will help us build a community where everybody's got a role to play and a place at the table.	0
ClaimBuster	16501				Certainly anyone in the White House should have the character to be there.	0
ClaimBuster	16502				And it literally says to the communities, re-invent the schools, not just the bricks and mortar but the curriculum and everything else.	0
ClaimBuster	16503				But the point is, that - that a president ought to lead this country.	0
ClaimBuster	16504				If the question -- maybe I -- get it wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	16505				I have personally told President Pack that the United States does not condone the kind of repressive measures that he has taken in that country.	1
ClaimBuster	16506				You've made a lot of it because of the fact that you've been in office.	1
ClaimBuster	16507				It's 10 cents a year cumulative.	1
ClaimBuster	16508				It was in the previous administration, in the Bush-Quayle administration, and I think in retrospect the lessons there are ones that we should take very, very seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	16509				Number two, I asked the president a question I think Hispanics and immigrants all over the nation have asked.	1
ClaimBuster	16510				If you want to do a voucher program in Missouri, fine.	0
ClaimBuster	16511				We've got to invest and grow.	0
ClaimBuster	16512				The Shah, whatever he might have done, was building low-cost housing, had taken land away from the Mullahs and was distributing it to the peasants so they could be landowners -- things of that kind.	1
ClaimBuster	16513				Depends on what he says in the future in the campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	16514				These are all the things, I think, in this country that can make our society strong, or can mean that it stands still.	0
ClaimBuster	16515				Now, the taxes are a very simple thing.	0
ClaimBuster	16516				Well, there are summits being held.	1
ClaimBuster	16517				Now, it is trillions of dollars out of balance, and the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history - the payroll tax increase for Social Security - which will only put a band-aid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most.	1
ClaimBuster	16518				But I think it's a very interesting proposal, to see if we can find, first of all, something that renders those weapons obsolete, incapable of their mission.	0
ClaimBuster	16519				But more importantly it is true that in order for us to be competitive, we're going to have to make some smart choices right now.	0
ClaimBuster	16520				But I don't favor a constitutional amendment on the subject.	0
ClaimBuster	16521				Than they are on research and development.	0
ClaimBuster	16522				Because we ended the war in Iraq, we were able to refocus our attention on not only the terrorist threat, but also beginning a transition process in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	16523				Whatever happened to the element of surprise, OK?	0
ClaimBuster	16524				"But I must say I'm a little offended by this word ""scheme."""	0
ClaimBuster	16525				And he could do the job.	0
ClaimBuster	16526				We've got to change it.	0
ClaimBuster	16527				There has never been a weapon invented in the history of man that has not led to a defensive, a counterweapon.	1
ClaimBuster	16528				It's -- the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	16529				Gosh, I just don't think I ever said I'm not worried about Osama bin Laden.	1
ClaimBuster	16530				Senator Kennedy's position and mine completely different on this.	0
ClaimBuster	16531				They've intermarried with Al Qaida and the Taliban.	1
ClaimBuster	16532				Why can't we have that once again?	0
ClaimBuster	16533				I know the President's been puffing a lot on that.	0
ClaimBuster	16534				Well, my strategy is pretty straightforward, which is to go after the bad guys, to make sure we do our very best to interrupt them, to -- to kill them, to take them out of the picture.	0
ClaimBuster	16535				ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	16536				Meanwhile, they were getting all kinds of money in campaign contributions.	1
ClaimBuster	16537				General Twining, in January, fifty-nine, described the position of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	16538				We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of.	0
ClaimBuster	16539				We can put the Communists on the defensive.	0
ClaimBuster	16540				They did after he left.	1
ClaimBuster	16541				They convince the international community they are not pursuing a nuclear program.	1
ClaimBuster	16542				Reduce the capital gains rate.	0
ClaimBuster	16543				As a matter of fact, oil production is down 14 percent this year on federal land, and gas production was down 9 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	16544				And it would be a federal law preventing that.	0
ClaimBuster	16545				Under the last Democratic administration 60 percent of all weapons that went into the Middle East were for Israel.	1
ClaimBuster	16546				That's not going to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	16547				We've lost the vision of what our country can and ought to be.	0
ClaimBuster	16548				I thought during his debate with Senator Bradley saying he authored the EITC when it didn't happen.	1
ClaimBuster	16549				You know we've suffered discrimination in the disability community.	0
ClaimBuster	16550				There is a great program called Project Exile in Richmond, Virginia, where we focused federal taxpayers' money and federal prosecutors and went after people who were illegally using guns.	1
ClaimBuster	16551				Well, I'll tell you what it means.	0
ClaimBuster	16552				They start from a much lower base.	0
ClaimBuster	16553				I was there for a while before I left on June the 11th.	1
ClaimBuster	16554				I have a plan for doing that.	0
ClaimBuster	16555				I feel very strongly about the people who go into battle for our country.	0
ClaimBuster	16556				The Vice President believes only the right people ought to get tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	16557				Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they're telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence.	1
ClaimBuster	16558				The plans are all over Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	16559				Now, I feel very strongly about a lot of things.	0
ClaimBuster	16560				That's not right in America.	0
ClaimBuster	16561				That turned out to be wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	16562				We've made every one of them eligible for a tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	16563				If this were a spending contest, I would come in second.	0
ClaimBuster	16564				The member of a labor union must have his rights strengthened and broadened and our children in their education should have an opportunity to improve themselves based on their talents and their abilities.	0
ClaimBuster	16565				And we're doing just that.	0
ClaimBuster	16566				The safest of federal investments yields 4%.	1
ClaimBuster	16567				I want regulators to see their job as encouraging small enterprise, not crushing it.	0
ClaimBuster	16568				But I'm totally opposed to discrimination.	0
ClaimBuster	16569				If we turn to Helsinki - I'm glad you raised it, Mr. uh - Frankel.	0
ClaimBuster	16570				And we fixed it for a reason: because there are too many people still in this country who feel the stark resistance of racism, and so we have a distance to travel.	0
ClaimBuster	16571				For 3 months -- quarters I've been fighting, 3 quarters been fighting to get the Congress to pass some incentives for small business.	1
ClaimBuster	16572				And the answer they came up with was this:	0
ClaimBuster	16573				And we've had many successful Muslims.	1
ClaimBuster	16574				And Texas is number one in industrial pollution.	1
ClaimBuster	16575				Guinea and Ghana, two independent countries within the last three years - Guinea in fifty-seven, Ghana within the last eighteen months - both now are supporting the Soviet foreign policy at the U.N. Mr. Herter said so himself.	1
ClaimBuster	16576				And in the field of executive leadership, I can say that I believe it's essential that the president of the United States not only set the tone but he also must lead; he must act as he talks.	0
ClaimBuster	16577				I'll tell you where we disagree.	0
ClaimBuster	16578				Now we have a runaway arms race.	0
ClaimBuster	16579				But that's how we're going to win the peace, by rapidly training the Iraqis themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	16580				It was higher when I came into office.	1
ClaimBuster	16581				And then we're going to have to get to a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	16582				Now, but here is why it's directly relevant, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	16583				Premiums have gotten too high.	1
ClaimBuster	16584				We didn't have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops.	1
ClaimBuster	16585				I have opposed drawing a line because I know that the moment you draw a line, that is an encouragement for the Communists to attack - to step up their blackmail and to force you into the war that none of us want.	0
ClaimBuster	16586				I have made myself at least ten uh - speeches in various parts of the country where I have discussed with the American people defense and foreign policy.	1
ClaimBuster	16587				Will they raise incomes in America?	0
ClaimBuster	16588				Well, Americans have gotten to know Sarah Palin.	0
ClaimBuster	16589				And her son had been shot through the head.	1
ClaimBuster	16590				We've expanded Pell Grants for millions of people, including millions of young women, all across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	16591				My passion is to pass a jobs program and get incomes up with an investment incentive program to grow jobs in the private sector, to waste less public money and invest more, to control health care costs and provide for affordable health care for all Americans and to make sure we've got the best trained workforce in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	16592				Let me just finish the point.	0
ClaimBuster	16593				And you know, you've seen the list, I've seen the list, we won't go into the names, but no wonder they -- if I had those people around me all day every day, telling me it was fair and free, I might believe it.	0
ClaimBuster	16594				Mr. President, Mr. President, you're entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts.	0
ClaimBuster	16595				And my economic plan calls for that.	0
ClaimBuster	16596				"And DeGaulle waved them off and said, ""No, no, no, no."	1
ClaimBuster	16597				And I said, well, yes.	0
ClaimBuster	16598				And I just don't think that dog will hunt this time.	0
ClaimBuster	16599				The payroll taxes are your money.	1
ClaimBuster	16600				Now, I've got a plan with this new welfare reform law to work with the private sector, to give employees specific tax incentives to hire people off welfare, and to do some other things which will create more jobs in the private sector, at least a million, and move more people from welfare to work.	0
ClaimBuster	16601				Number two, we have to make America the most attractive place for entrepreneurs, for people who want to expand their business.	0
ClaimBuster	16602				This has been probably the biggest whopper that's been told during the course of this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	16603				Now, I know that we have some disagreements on this.	0
ClaimBuster	16604				Well, let's step back and talk about what's happening in Syria and how important it is.	0
ClaimBuster	16605				If we're smart and if we trust workers and if we understand the power of the compounding rate of interest.	0
ClaimBuster	16606				But a President must also have a vision of where this nation should go.	0
ClaimBuster	16607				Well, he's better off than he was four years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	16608				But in terms of being influenced by women and being a minority, there they are right out there, my wife and my 4 beautiful daughters, and I just have 1 son, so he and I are surrounded by women, giving -- telling us what to do all the time.	1
ClaimBuster	16609				Of course, both er - Senator Kennedy and I have felt Mr. Truman's ire; and uh - consequently, I think he can speak with some feeling on this subject.	0
ClaimBuster	16610				I thought they would stay and fight, but they didn't.	0
ClaimBuster	16611				Even if you put his income up ten percent, that would be two and three-quarters percent three pers- or three cents out of that twenty-five cents.	1
ClaimBuster	16612				And I believe that if we can get a party which believes in movement, which believes in going ahead, then we can reestablish our position in the world - strong defense, strong in economic growth, justice for our people, co- guarantee of constitutional rights, so that people will believe that we practice what we preach, and then around the world, particularly to try to reestablish the atmosphere which existed in Latin America at the time of Franklin Roosevelt.	0
ClaimBuster	16613				My view is that you can do these programs - and they should be carefully drawn - within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	16614				And our alliance is strong.	0
ClaimBuster	16615				I cannot believe I'm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.	0
ClaimBuster	16616				When I campaigned in a race, a lot of folks didn't think I could win including, by the way, my mother.	1
ClaimBuster	16617				He talked about a nuclear freeze back at the time when I was in Europe trying to convince European public opinion that we ought to go forward with the deployment of the INF weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	16618				Let me give you a story about public education, if I might.	0
ClaimBuster	16619				Then we want to give modest middle-class tax relief to restore some fairness, especially to middle- class people with families with incomes of under $60,000.	0
ClaimBuster	16620				And that takes a lot of planning and preparation.	0
ClaimBuster	16621				You did it in 1985.	1
ClaimBuster	16622				Our program was an amendment to the Kerr bill.	1
ClaimBuster	16623				I mean, we thought we'd whip more of them going in.	0
ClaimBuster	16624				Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?	0
ClaimBuster	16625				Voters will know I'll put competent judges on the bench.	0
ClaimBuster	16626				Therefore, the burden of maintaining the peace falls on us.	0
ClaimBuster	16627				We have a divided nation.	0
ClaimBuster	16628				I've met them, people like Mary Annie and Edward Davis in Nashua, New Hampshire.	1
ClaimBuster	16629				Well, I was interested in Senator Obama's reaction to the Russian aggression against Georgia.	0
ClaimBuster	16630				I've been fighting for proliferation the entire time -- anti-proliferation the entire time I've been in the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	16631				By contrast, Donald's plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	16632				These crooks -- now, Willie Sutton would have gone to own a savings and loan rather than rob banks, because he robbed banks because that's where the money is; owning a savings and loan is where the money was.	1
ClaimBuster	16633				He has about a third as much chance to be a professional man, about half as much chance to own a house.	1
ClaimBuster	16634				But I have common sense.	0
ClaimBuster	16635				We spend six hundred dollars per person in this country - every man, woman and child - for health care.	1
ClaimBuster	16636				You're not going to have the opportunities; there are going to be more deficits, more drugs, more crime, and less confidence in the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	16637				That's the importance of party; only if it tells something about the record.	0
ClaimBuster	16638				But we have no leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	16639				Ross was very articulate across the country.	0
ClaimBuster	16640				The last eight years the average growth has been about two and a half per cent.	1
ClaimBuster	16641				And I am not going to lay down my arms in the middle of the campaign for somebody who has got no credibility on the issue.	0
ClaimBuster	16642				I don't think you can just rely on U.N. sanctions, Randee.	0
ClaimBuster	16643				I'll make one more point.	0
ClaimBuster	16644				We're quarantining him diplomatically by bringing back our Ambassador; economically by cutting off trade, and Senator Kennedy's suggestion that the trade that we cut off is not significant is just one hundred percent wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	16645				I think that's a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	16646				"Third, I would say this with regard to this report, with regard to Gallup Polls of prestige abroad and everything else that we've been hearing about ""what about American prestige abroad"": America's prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesmen for America allow it to be."	0
ClaimBuster	16647				But still, it's good that at least once, all three of us were heard by the people of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	16648				I like the policies that will encourage farmers to put -- set aside land as well for conservation purposes.	0
ClaimBuster	16649				So the polls to me are interesting, but they don't determine, you know, my hopes or - or my despair.	0
ClaimBuster	16650				I think that decisions should rest in the hands of the states.	0
ClaimBuster	16651				"When Mr. Reagan raised this uh - question in Florida uh - Mr. Ford not only disavowed his instructions, but he also even dropped, parenthetically, the use of the word ""detente."""	1
ClaimBuster	16652				I believe that there is enough extravagance and fat in government.	0
ClaimBuster	16653				We have work to do to fight a real war, not a phony war, against drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	16654				It's just going to be talk.	0
ClaimBuster	16655				This is what I deeply believe.	0
ClaimBuster	16656				And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.	0
ClaimBuster	16657				Let's start with a premise.	0
ClaimBuster	16658				Our economic strength is still there.	0
ClaimBuster	16659				I know that uh Chief Justice Burger is.	0
ClaimBuster	16660				We've taken no strong position in the uh - control of pollution of our oceans, and I would say the worst uh - threat to the environment of all is nuclear proliferation.	0
ClaimBuster	16661				One thing I will not do is sock every business in the country and, thus, throw some people out of work.	0
ClaimBuster	16662				Every time the United States has been an one side and they've been on the other side, our position has been sustained.	1
ClaimBuster	16663				And I am convinced that the alternate proposals that I have, that the Republicans have in the field of health, in the field of education, in the field of welfare, because they are not extreme, because they will accomplish the end uh - without too great cost in dollars or in freedom, that they could get through the next Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	16664				I think it is a worthy goal in America to have every child protected by law and welcomed in life.	0
ClaimBuster	16665				And therefore, I have been in favor of a separate minimum for them.	0
ClaimBuster	16666				Twenty new countries in Africa during the course of this Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	16667				I want to quote somebody a little closer to home, Harry Truman.	0
ClaimBuster	16668				And I can assure you that if we had not taken the strong and forceful action that we did, we would have been uh - criticized very, very uh - severely for sitting back and not moving.	0
ClaimBuster	16669				And I may be better off four years from now, but I don't know.	0
ClaimBuster	16670				I want us to do more to help small business.	0
ClaimBuster	16671				But it is good for America to improve fuel efficiency.	0
ClaimBuster	16672				And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security.	1
ClaimBuster	16673				So it seems to me that there's also a public trust.	0
ClaimBuster	16674				Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue.	1
ClaimBuster	16675				It is essential that America's word be good.	0
ClaimBuster	16676				But she is raising your taxes and I'm lowering your taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	16677				Again, you can look it up.	0
ClaimBuster	16678				As far as what experience counts and whether that is experience that counts, that isn't for me to say.	0
ClaimBuster	16679				Seventy percent of my state's money goes to the public schools, and I was really honored when Time magazine said that our schools have shown more improvement than any other state in the country except one other -- they named 2 states showing real strides forward in the 80s.	1
ClaimBuster	16680				... to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it, as well.	1
ClaimBuster	16681				They've been talking about it in Washington, D.C.	1
ClaimBuster	16682				I have fought time after time against these pork barrel -- these bills that come to the floor and they have all kinds of goodies and all kinds of things in them for everybody and they buy off the votes.	0
ClaimBuster	16683				Well, the Massachusetts furlough program was unique.	1
ClaimBuster	16684				If the people send me to Washington the first thing I'll do is study that 2000-page agreement and make sure it's a 2-way street.	0
ClaimBuster	16685				And I would like to urge the school superintendents and the others around the country to stand up now and keep us moving forward on a path towards real excellence.	0
ClaimBuster	16686				There are some problem banks out there.	1
ClaimBuster	16687				And therefore just kids were being shuffled through the school.	0
ClaimBuster	16688				Do you know that we've laid a $10 trillion debt on these young Americans who are here with us tonight, $500 billion of it we owe to China?	1
ClaimBuster	16689				Why didn't you do it?	0
ClaimBuster	16690				These are the policies I have fought for my entire career.	1
ClaimBuster	16691				I would ask him to name one Republican president who led this nation into war.	0
ClaimBuster	16692				Yeah, I can't imagine what it would be like to be singled out because of race and stopped and harassed.	0
ClaimBuster	16693				This deal is terribly destructive to the US airline industry.	0
ClaimBuster	16694				It's a system that cries out for accountability and transparency and the adequate funding.	0
ClaimBuster	16695				Let me say first of all, I want to answer your specific question but first of all, we all agree that there should be a growing economy.	0
ClaimBuster	16696				It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages.	1
ClaimBuster	16697				I think they will, and I think we'll get there.	0
ClaimBuster	16698				Ukraine, right now, is in the sights of Vladimir Putin, those that want to reassemble the old Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	16699				I think of classroom teachers, classroom teachers that I have had, classroom teachers that youngsters have today who are real heroes to our young people.	0
ClaimBuster	16700				And you might find those words in a Democratic platform of some years ago -- I know, because I was a Democrat at that time.	1
ClaimBuster	16701				Because we've got to make sure that our economy is strong at home so that we can project military power overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	16702				What I called it, I labeled it affirmative access.	1
ClaimBuster	16703				And I want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home, and not in defeat, that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	16704				I don't think that'll work.	0
ClaimBuster	16705				And my first organization was just four or five people plus my wife and my children, my three sons and their wives.	1
ClaimBuster	16706				And Assad -- excuse me, Kofi Annan came in and said we're going to try to have a ceasefire.	1
ClaimBuster	16707				I don't think you can secure America for the long run if you don't have a comprehensive view as to how to defeat these people.	0
ClaimBuster	16708				It takes public money and gives it to families or individuals to choose the school they want.	1
ClaimBuster	16709				And I beg the American people, any time they think about reforming education to take this piece of society that doesn't have a chance and take these little pieces of clay that can be shaped and molded and give them the same love and nurture and affection and support you give your children and teach them that they're unique and that they're precious and that there's only one person in the world like them and you will see this nation bloom.	0
ClaimBuster	16710				And they went out and bought up these mortgages.	1
ClaimBuster	16711				We're the leading donor in the world to help the suffering people there.	1
ClaimBuster	16712				I demanded an apology from Vice President Bush because I had, instead, honored these young men, grieved for their families, and think they were wonderful Americans that honored us all.	1
ClaimBuster	16713				I admire the fact that he is a great dad.	0
ClaimBuster	16714				What was the other part of it?	0
ClaimBuster	16715				So what I've tried to do is be consistent.	0
ClaimBuster	16716				I'm here tonight for these young people up here in the balcony from this college.	1
ClaimBuster	16717				He said he would reform it.	1
ClaimBuster	16718				You haven't just accepted research, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	16719				I found that, in this world, that it's important to establish good personal relationships with people so that when you have disagreements, you're able to disagree in a way that is effective.	0
ClaimBuster	16720				Over the next four years, we'll make sure the economy continues to grow.	0
ClaimBuster	16721				I don't know what other weapons the Vice President is talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	16722				So I am one who believes that we can	0
ClaimBuster	16723				I want to go down the path of growth that puts Americans to work with more money coming in because they're working.	0
ClaimBuster	16724				Look, I've got five boys.	1
ClaimBuster	16725				I do not want to see us go to again and Fm using this word advisedly a liberal majority that is going to legislate from the Bench.	0
ClaimBuster	16726				That's just one example of how you can save money and improve the quality of life at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	16727				I'm proud that we're better off on that than we were four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	16728				They have poor-quality health care.	1
ClaimBuster	16729				My best friend from grade school is a computer software salesman and he told me last time he changed employers it took him nine months to figure out how to transfer his 401K plan.	1
ClaimBuster	16730				We're going to have trade, but we're going -- we're going to terminate it, we're going to make a great trade deal.	0
ClaimBuster	16731				Our coalition against Saddam is unraveling.	0
ClaimBuster	16732				In Georgia alone, for instance, I got 84 percent of the vote, and I think there were fourteen people uh - in addition to myself on the ballot, and Governor Wallace had been very strong in Georgia.	1
ClaimBuster	16733				It's time for the man to go.	0
ClaimBuster	16734				We give them $1.7 billion in cash.	1
ClaimBuster	16735				I can't tell you how many people I meet who don't have health insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	16736				And they include you and me.	0
ClaimBuster	16737				And we have not set an example for our own people.	0
ClaimBuster	16738				It says to you as a taxpayer -- say you're going to pay a tax of 1000 bucks or something.	0
ClaimBuster	16739				You know, WikiLeaks just actually came out -- John Podesta said some horrible things about you, and, boy, was he right.	1
ClaimBuster	16740				We need to be thinking about cyber security.	0
ClaimBuster	16741				But I want to warn my fellow citizens: The cost of doing nothing, the cost of saying the current system is OK, far exceeds the costs of trying to make sure we save the system for our children.	1
ClaimBuster	16742				So it's not just the addition of troops that matters.	0
ClaimBuster	16743				So we're going to have to make some investments, but we've also got to make spending cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	16744				We still have some of that hatred inside us.	0
ClaimBuster	16745				The problem I see is that there are too many guns getting into the hands of children, and criminals, and people who, for whatever reason, some kind of history of stalking or domestic abuse really should not be able to get guns.	0
ClaimBuster	16746				No, but you got to go back to what social security was when it was created.	0
ClaimBuster	16747				A judicious use of the military which will help keep the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	16748				But look, let me sum it up.	0
ClaimBuster	16749				We can invite all the candidates.	0
ClaimBuster	16750				That's not the main issue.	0
ClaimBuster	16751				We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years.	1
ClaimBuster	16752				But as far as the accessibility of them by the American people, it's very uh - far in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	16753				I'll take the pledge because I know the American people want to talk about issues and not tabloid journalism.	0
ClaimBuster	16754				It is working, and we're going to continue on that same line.	1
ClaimBuster	16755				I think the man anybody that gets into this political arena and has to face you guys everyday deserves a word of praise.	0
ClaimBuster	16756				They continue to modernize and we can't simply we've got enough nuclear weapons, let's freeze.	0
ClaimBuster	16757				Donald has said he's in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood.	1
ClaimBuster	16758				Last year there were twenty-nine and tomorrow when the preliminary vote is held you will see a strengthening of that position or very closely to it.	1
ClaimBuster	16759				We resolved, we rescued Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	16760				Not if I didn't have a better idea.	0
ClaimBuster	16761				But I am not in favor of the plan that is so costly.	0
ClaimBuster	16762				It didn't exceed beyond mine, because I know that that's a strategy that has worked and can succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	16763				More Americans at work today than any time in history, a greater percentage of the work force.	1
ClaimBuster	16764				Instead of the federal government, we had that tax credit, pick up some of the costs, because if you have to hire a replacement worker, that's a cost.	0
ClaimBuster	16765				I will make sure we don't hurt the functioning of our -- of our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	16766				I want to give every middle-class family a $10,000 a year tax deduction for college tuition so that middle-class families will always be able to send their kids on to college.	0
ClaimBuster	16767				And the formula I've given you works, we've put it through a good economic model, we've got good economists on the West Coast, Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there who's a very respected economist in the - Massachusetts.	1
ClaimBuster	16768				I believe in its future.	0
ClaimBuster	16769				We had an even worse oil shock in 1979.	1
ClaimBuster	16770				I hope it isn't Christmas when you make that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	16771				So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now.	0
ClaimBuster	16772				It's the most successful thing we've ever done.	0
ClaimBuster	16773				We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	16774				I don't think a president can unilaterally overturn it.	0
ClaimBuster	16775				I think we uh - could call together, with strong leadership in the White House, business, industry and labor, and say let's have voluntary price restraints.	0
ClaimBuster	16776				They didn't have the right body armor.	1
ClaimBuster	16777				His running mate Jack Kemp once said that Bob Dole never met a tax he didn't hike.	1
ClaimBuster	16778				Let me say, first of all, I signed a tort reform bill that dealt with civilian aviation a couple of years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	16779				I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do.	1
ClaimBuster	16780				Now, Prime Minister Allawi came here, and he said the terrorists are pouring over the border.	1
ClaimBuster	16781				That is a national outrage.	0
ClaimBuster	16782				Now, uh - I'd like to point out as well that the United States' economic recovery from the recession of a year ago is well ahead of the economic recovery of any major free industrial nation in the world today.	1
ClaimBuster	16783				We -- we think of their families and care for them deeply.	0
ClaimBuster	16784				Whatever it is, whatever the checklist was in '92, it's all done with campaign finance reform.	1
ClaimBuster	16785				Here's some help for you to go to a community college.	0
ClaimBuster	16786				And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance.	0
ClaimBuster	16787				So the answer is I could do that.	0
ClaimBuster	16788				Are you going to go after Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and the handicapped again as you did last time?	0
ClaimBuster	16789				And there will be a significant transition.	0
ClaimBuster	16790				This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.	0
ClaimBuster	16791				That's why I do feel if some police officer is gunned down that the death penalty is required.	0
ClaimBuster	16792				My priority is making sure that we get more people hired.	0
ClaimBuster	16793				It can't do it all, but it can make a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	16794				He didn't call for self-deportation.	1
ClaimBuster	16795				Now that's what we have to do.	0
ClaimBuster	16796				When my grandfather fought in World War II and he came back and he got a G.I.	1
ClaimBuster	16797				There's not someone there directing all of this activity.	0
ClaimBuster	16798				I think I did the right thing.	0
ClaimBuster	16799				That's part of what happened in Afghanistan, where we rushed into Iraq and Senator McCain and President Bush suggested that it wasn't that important to catch bin Laden right now and that we could muddle through, and that has cost us dearly.	1
ClaimBuster	16800				So the point is that we will prevail in Afghanistan, but we need the new strategy and we need it to succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	16801				It's the fact that all the -- all of the details need to be known about Senator Obama's relationship with them and with ACORN and the American people will make a judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	16802				And so I think we need to think differently.	0
ClaimBuster	16803				It's a question of character and judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	16804				Did it make him withdraw from the north?	0
ClaimBuster	16805				We're going to have to sit down across the table, Republican and Democrat, as we did in 1983 between Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.	1
ClaimBuster	16806				Well, I think we need tough enforcement of the civil rights laws.	0
ClaimBuster	16807				And I said at that time that one of the things that we could do, that perhaps would save as much as $5 billion to $7 billion, according, to one of the leading members of the House Budget Committee, was to recalculate the index that is used to determine the cost of living benefits that are paid to civil service retirees, to military retirees.	1
ClaimBuster	16808				Well, Candy, actually, in my state, the pro-gun folks and the anti-gun folks came together and put together a piece of legislation.	1
ClaimBuster	16809				Strong, well-equipped, well-trained, well-maintained conventional forces.	0
ClaimBuster	16810				He's got to get this thing more clear.	0
ClaimBuster	16811				We are not investing that surplus like a pension fund.	1
ClaimBuster	16812				The top -- let's talk about my tax plan.	0
ClaimBuster	16813				A President, to defend this country and to get arms control, must master what's going on.	0
ClaimBuster	16814				On looking specifically at the Arkansas record -- he keeps criticizing us, criticizing me, I'm the incumbent, fine.	0
ClaimBuster	16815				We come up with practical, common sense solutions for problems that we're confronted with.	1
ClaimBuster	16816				By the way, number one I get rid of is Obamacare.	0
ClaimBuster	16817				It is the -- the biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	16818				"I remember a lady in Houston, Texas, told me, ""Reading is the new civil right,"" and she's right."	1
ClaimBuster	16819				And so I acknowledge that his daughters -- I've watched them.	1
ClaimBuster	16820				I admire the fact that he served for 20 years in the Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	16821				I'd like to point out that in the last six years, the Democratic Congresses, of which he'd been a member, have cut twenty million dollars off of the Voice of America programs.	1
ClaimBuster	16822				"Then he said, ""I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU."""	1
ClaimBuster	16823				We have a chance in the next 15 years, insisting upon the health and safety of workers in the mines, and also preserving the same high air and water pollution standards, to triple the amount of coal we produce.	0
ClaimBuster	16824				The jobs that are being created in Arizona right now are paying about $13,700 less than the jobs that we're losing.	1
ClaimBuster	16825				They're interested in keeping Assad in power.	1
ClaimBuster	16826				Now, he has to get a better job out of his Congress if he's going to get us the money that we need to conduct the foreign affairs of this country in Latin America or any place else.	0
ClaimBuster	16827				He starts saying, government will do this and government will do that, and then government will, and he'll impose mandates.	0
ClaimBuster	16828				And I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you.	0
ClaimBuster	16829				Iris, this is one where we have some agreement, I think.	0
ClaimBuster	16830				If we make investments now so that people have coverage, that we are preventing diseases, that will save on Medicare and Medicaid in the future.	1
ClaimBuster	16831				And that's where the President has opposed practically every arms control agreement, by every President, of both political parties, since the bomb went off.	1
ClaimBuster	16832				That is the true way I feel.	0
ClaimBuster	16833				In the last four years we've worked hard to promote more competition to bring down the rate of inflation in health care costs without eroding health care quality.	0
ClaimBuster	16834				And we're going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is.	0
ClaimBuster	16835				That tax bill does not entirely meet the criteria that I established.	1
ClaimBuster	16836				Uh - I think this is a responsible and a proper way to proceed.	0
ClaimBuster	16837				I think we all know America is going through tough times right now.	0
ClaimBuster	16838				There are, as you know, CIA men stationed in other countries in the world and, certainly, in Central America.	1
ClaimBuster	16839				The most dangerous aspect of this proposal is, for the first time, we would delegate to computers the decision as to whether to start a war.	0
ClaimBuster	16840				If the tax cut is your number one, two, three and four priority, you can't do education.	1
ClaimBuster	16841				And, you know, I'm frankly amazed that since you grew up 5 blocks from there you would think that what goes on in that state is irrelevant.	1
ClaimBuster	16842				This -- we have weakened our economy.	1
ClaimBuster	16843				Number two, that strip-mining bill would've severely set back our need for more coal, and Governor Carter has said repeatedly that coal is the resource that we need to use more in the effort to become independent of the uh - Arab oil supply.	1
ClaimBuster	16844				When -- when we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no, yes, that was a fight that we needed to have.	0
ClaimBuster	16845				Several years ago, I was given an assignment to write a letter.	1
ClaimBuster	16846				My opponent is for joining the International Criminal Court.	1
ClaimBuster	16847				Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries.	0
ClaimBuster	16848				A hundred thousand Americans a month have lost their health insurance just in the last 4 years.	1
ClaimBuster	16849				But let me talk about something that the president just sort of finished up with.	0
ClaimBuster	16850				"Groucho Marx said, ""Who do you believe?"	1
ClaimBuster	16851				It's a matter of being strong.	0
ClaimBuster	16852				That I can get something positive done on behalf of the people.	0
ClaimBuster	16853				I do not agree with Senator McCain that we're going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with countries like Russia and China that are, I think Senator McCain would agree, not democracies, but have extensive trade with Iran but potentially have an interest in making sure Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon.	0
ClaimBuster	16854				I'm more optimistic today than I was when I began about this nation providing we have the kind of leadership in Washington that can work with you, that can build partnerships, that can build jobs in every part of this country, not certain parts of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	16855				And recognizing that, I called together a group of our fellow citizens to study the issue.	1
ClaimBuster	16856				And so I think this is an issue.	0
ClaimBuster	16857				At the end of the first day, that little child wants out.	0
ClaimBuster	16858				And I really was moved, as well as impressed, by the speech that he gave to the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	16859				I have a proud record of working with both Republicans and Democrats, which is what our nation needs.	1
ClaimBuster	16860				And we would target it especially in areas that have been either depressed or which have lost a lot of defense related jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	16861				I've been proud to be president of the United States during these very troubled times.	0
ClaimBuster	16862				So, I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw: The leadership isn't taking us where we want to go.	0
ClaimBuster	16863				And that's grossly unfair to the average American who is paying his taxes and paying them on time and doesn't have any alternative: it's taken out of his paycheck.	0
ClaimBuster	16864				And I would think, it seems to me that there are opportunities here.	0
ClaimBuster	16865				My -- my view is that this president should have honored his promise to do as he said.	0
ClaimBuster	16866				I have relatives on Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	16867				As far as moving these people out and moving -- we either have a country or we don't.	0
ClaimBuster	16868				I've also suggested that there are weapons systems that we should proceed on, and I've outlined those in detail.	1
ClaimBuster	16869				You've got to let small businesses have more incentives.	0
ClaimBuster	16870				I also need -- the next leader needs to be patient.	0
ClaimBuster	16871				Let me reel some things off real quick, because you said you wanted specifics.	0
ClaimBuster	16872				And, so, I think that I'd leave it right there and say that you judge on the whole record.	0
ClaimBuster	16873				I think the uh - problem should've been addressed by increasing productivity, by having uh - put - put people back to work so they could purchase more goods, lower income taxes on individuals, perhaps raise them, if necessary, on corporations in comparison.	0
ClaimBuster	16874				That paid their mortgage payments?	0
ClaimBuster	16875				Let me say, that I found one thing in Governor Bush's answer that we certainly agree on, and that's the low income heating assistance program.	0
ClaimBuster	16876				"And he said to me and to the whole hall, he said, ""You know, don't take away my hope, because my hope is what keeps me going."""	1
ClaimBuster	16877				Forty-3 -- more than that -- states have it, I believe.	1
ClaimBuster	16878				In the Senate I was one of only ten Democrats, along with Senator Joe Lieberman, to support Governor Bush's dad in the Persian Gulf War Resolution.	1
ClaimBuster	16879				So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.	0
ClaimBuster	16880				But it also has to be tempered with our ability to beneficially affect the situation.	0
ClaimBuster	16881				And ironically, the single thing that has strengthened Iran over the last several years has been the war in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	16882				I used to sign welfare checks for my grandparents.	1
ClaimBuster	16883				I believe in the sanctity of marriage.	0
ClaimBuster	16884				It isn't a question of the number of people who are working in an Administration.	0
ClaimBuster	16885				That lesson tells us two things: One, pick a President that you know will know if that tragic moment ever comes what he must know, because there'll be no time for staffing committees or advisers.	0
ClaimBuster	16886				I had precisely in mind a lot of the people that were in the White House and other agencies who've never been had any experience, who came to Washington without any experience, they all were very liberal, of course, or they wouldn't be in the administration.	0
ClaimBuster	16887				And we also agree on the need for making sure that if we have bad teachers that they are swiftly -- after given an opportunity to prove themselves, if they can't hack it, then we need to move on because our kids have to have their best future.	0
ClaimBuster	16888				They understand that a free Afghanistan or a free Iraq will be a major defeat for them.	0
ClaimBuster	16889				It is the United States Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	16890				It isn't necessary to - to run America down in order to build her up.	0
ClaimBuster	16891				Middle class seniors like George McKinney and his wife are not covered for four to five years.	1
ClaimBuster	16892				They have an income of $25,000 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	16893				I'll call it the economy tax.	0
ClaimBuster	16894				They made sure their sons understood that this was the greatest country in the world, that those of us especially who were the sons and daughters of immigrants had a special responsibility to give something to the country that had opened up its arms to our parents and given so much to them.	0
ClaimBuster	16895				And that sends a confusing signal to people.	1
ClaimBuster	16896				This is a bad tax.	0
ClaimBuster	16897				And they are trying artificially extend the monopoly patent protection so they can keep charging these very high prices.	1
ClaimBuster	16898				Mr. Carter wants to increase taxes for roughly half of the taxpayers of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	16899				I don't know if that's exactly accurate or not.	0
ClaimBuster	16900				I mean, seriously -- labels don't mean anything.	0
ClaimBuster	16901				I will balance our budgets and I will get them and I will...	0
ClaimBuster	16902				But number two, because I recognized that if you're going to have women in the workforce that sometimes you need to be more flexible.	0
ClaimBuster	16903				I believe him when he says that he has a good heart.	0
ClaimBuster	16904				We will reduce the cost of a barrel of oil because we show the world that we have a supply of our own.	0
ClaimBuster	16905				Secondly, we're going to create a manufacturing jobs credit and a new jobs credit for people to be able to help hire and be more competitive here in America.	0
ClaimBuster	16906				And we almost had it done.	0
ClaimBuster	16907				We don't have any inspection.	1
ClaimBuster	16908				That's what debates are about and that's what campaigns are about.	0
ClaimBuster	16909				I don't believe that's in the American people's interest.	0
ClaimBuster	16910				She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign...	0
ClaimBuster	16911				I just don't think it's fair to tax people's assets twice regardless of your status.	0
ClaimBuster	16912				This year my state ranks first in the country in job growth, 4th in manufacturing in job growth, 4th in income growth, 4th in the decline of poverty.	1
ClaimBuster	16913				In uh - November of 1975 I met with the leaders of the five industrial nations in France for the purpose of seeing what we could do acting together to meet the problems of uh - the coming recession.	1
ClaimBuster	16914				So when you say it has no impact, it really did.	0
ClaimBuster	16915				And here's some help for you to go get an education.	0
ClaimBuster	16916				He's lost his most recent job and we've now just lost our home.	1
ClaimBuster	16917				So let's fix what's broken about it, but let's not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies.	0
ClaimBuster	16918				They now hold a trillion dollars' worth of our debt.	1
ClaimBuster	16919				Well, nobody's gotten into the real issue yet on the savings and loan again -- nobody's got a business background, I guess.	0
ClaimBuster	16920				That's exactly what Kim Jong Il wants.	0
ClaimBuster	16921				But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...	1
ClaimBuster	16922				"The terrorism czar, who has worked for every president since Ronald Reagan, said, ""Invading Iraq in response to 9/11 would be like Franklin Roosevelt invading Mexico in response to Pearl Harbor."""	1
ClaimBuster	16923				And thank you for your service to the country.	0
ClaimBuster	16924				We must let them know that the great American ideals - of independence, of the right of people to be free, and of the right to progress - that these are ideals that belong not to ourselves alone, but they belong to everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	16925				I think they're going to see through it.	0
ClaimBuster	16926				I see no evidence that it has done it.	0
ClaimBuster	16927				If he says that, this issue will not be discussed in the campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	16928				Mr. Landon ran in 1936 to repeal it.	1
ClaimBuster	16929				He talks about a smaller government.	1
ClaimBuster	16930				I haven't changed my mind: I'm going to fully fund it.	0
ClaimBuster	16931				They're not correct and if you look at my life, until I got involved in this effort, I was one person.	1
ClaimBuster	16932				I am going to carry this election debate all across this country in the last whatever remains of the last three and a half weeks, or whatever we have and the answer is no; I am not going to have any more debates, we don't need any more debates.	0
ClaimBuster	16933				I've also proposed a voluntary national test in the fourth grade and eighth grade, and a form of testing the governor has not endorsed.	1
ClaimBuster	16934				And I don't deserve that.	0
ClaimBuster	16935				I'm going to make sure --	0
ClaimBuster	16936				We could have bilateral talks with Kim Jong Il.	0
ClaimBuster	16937				I went to the Philippines as Vice President, pressed for human rights, called for the release of Aquino, and made progress that had been stalled on both the Subic and the Clark airfield bases.	1
ClaimBuster	16938				As a matter of fact, there are some pretty scientific and solid figures about how much space there still is in the world and how many more people we can have.	1
ClaimBuster	16939				Secondly, I think your plan -- a lot of fine print in your plan, Mr. Vice President, with all due respect.	0
ClaimBuster	16940				First of all, there is the historical perspective that I just described.	0
ClaimBuster	16941				I've been -- Ann was with someone just the other day that was just weeping about not being able to get work.	1
ClaimBuster	16942				He says he supports the President's position.	1
ClaimBuster	16943				I thought you'd forgotten I was here.	0
ClaimBuster	16944				That's what you have elections for.	0
ClaimBuster	16945				Well, I don't question his passion.	0
ClaimBuster	16946				We've got to turn this thing around.	0
ClaimBuster	16947				This is, with all due respect, Governor, that's a red herring.	0
ClaimBuster	16948				Well, Mr. Cater, of course it's a criticism that uh - is being made.	0
ClaimBuster	16949				...they would have gone through a...	0
ClaimBuster	16950				We raise the student loans.	0
ClaimBuster	16951				Stop some of this senseless litigation and let people work in America.	0
ClaimBuster	16952				These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price.	0
ClaimBuster	16953				One of the cornerstones of reform, and good reform, is to measure.	0
ClaimBuster	16954				But Governor Clinton's philosophy is isolate them.	0
ClaimBuster	16955				We tried to provide an appropriation of a billion and a half for five years, on a long-term loan basis, which this Administration opposed.	1
ClaimBuster	16956				But I do believe that we need to bolster our friends and allies.	0
ClaimBuster	16957				And I think that's the only answer.	0
ClaimBuster	16958				First of all, I think it's important to make voting more accessible.	0
ClaimBuster	16959				I think whoever is in the White House should just make it absolutely unconscionable and inexcusable, and if anybody's in the middle of a speech at, you know, one of these conventions, I would expect the candidate to go out and lift him off the stage if he starts preaching hate -- because we don't have time for it.	0
ClaimBuster	16960				He'll put liberal activists justices who will use their bench to subvert the legislature, that's what he'll do.	0
ClaimBuster	16961				How does it look in a program he called or some one of these marvelous Boston adjective up there and-about Angola-now, we have a chance-several Bostonians don't like it, but the rest of the country will understand.	0
ClaimBuster	16962				There were others who took a hike.	1
ClaimBuster	16963				I think it's been pretty impressive.	0
ClaimBuster	16964				Let me assure you that we made every possible overture to the People's Republic of China and through them to the Cambodian Government.	0
ClaimBuster	16965				I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth.	1
ClaimBuster	16966				Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand there is a connected between the two.	0
ClaimBuster	16967				That will -- that will reduce costs.	0
ClaimBuster	16968				The only thing I knew to do was to get aid as quickly as possible with state and federal help, and to put my arms around the man and his family and cry with them.	0
ClaimBuster	16969				When we are weak at home economically - high unemployment, high inflation, a confused government, a wasteful defense establishment, this encourages the kind of pressure that's been put on us successfully.	0
ClaimBuster	16970				I do not believe that someone who has supported Roe v. Wade that would be part of those qualifications.	0
ClaimBuster	16971				You've got one parent working for the government, the other parent working for the family.	0
ClaimBuster	16972				And every health care economist that looks at it says, over time, what'll happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse.	0
ClaimBuster	16973				They know that these toxic waste dumps should have been cleaned up a long time ago, and they know that people's lives and health are being risked, because we've had an administration that has been totally insensitive to the law and the demand for the protection of the environment.	1
ClaimBuster	16974				We saved an auto industry that was on the brink of collapse.	1
ClaimBuster	16975				And take a look at mine, also, and you'll see.	0
ClaimBuster	16976				Look, I -- I was on Navy ships that had nuclear power plants.	1
ClaimBuster	16977				You can keep what you have today, keep a high deductible, keep high premiums, keep a high co-pay, keep low benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	16978				Well, I think that trade is an important issue.	0
ClaimBuster	16979				Yes, I think we need more troops.	0
ClaimBuster	16980				Because I want to give new choices to parents.	0
ClaimBuster	16981				Russia and its republics are out of control or at best in weak control right now.	0
ClaimBuster	16982				... at a time when it's vitally important.	0
ClaimBuster	16983				We've gone from $10 trillion of national debt, to $16 trillion of national debt.	1
ClaimBuster	16984				She has been outsmarted by Putin.	0
ClaimBuster	16985				I've never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	16986				But the people who will be helped the most by it are the working people who will get the jobs created because of this tax.	0
ClaimBuster	16987				Actually it was a town hall, and I said I would cut taxes for middle- class families, and that's what I've done, by $3,600.00.	1
ClaimBuster	16988				What I support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	16989				And then, of course, with regards to standing for our principles, when -- when the students took to the streets in Tehran and the people there protested, the Green Revolution occurred, for the president to be silent I thought was an enormous mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	16990				And they were desperate for some way of getting coverage, because, understandably, they're worried that, if they get sick, they could go bankrupt.	1
ClaimBuster	16991				He promised you a tax cut in 1992, and if you got one, you ought to vote for him.	1
ClaimBuster	16992				The governor's plan is Social Security minus.	0
ClaimBuster	16993				Secondly, one of the things that we have to be careful about in politics is throwing money at a system that has not yet been reformed.	0
ClaimBuster	16994				My plan -- you can read my plan.	0
ClaimBuster	16995				In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to close it, but then the majority in the House of Representatives went the other way.	1
ClaimBuster	16996				Of course they all want to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	16997				So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones.	1
ClaimBuster	16998				So in principle, though, I'll take your point and think we ought to discuss child care or whatever else it is.	0
ClaimBuster	16999				Why can't Landale Shakespeare in Cleveland or Pilar Gonzales in Milwaukee give their children an opportunity to go to a better school.	0
ClaimBuster	17000				There are people all over the federal government, if they could just touch it with a screwdriver, could fix it.	0
ClaimBuster	17001				And I really want to just talk about something slightly different.	0
ClaimBuster	17002				I think we all do.	0
ClaimBuster	17003				Our dollar's at an all time low against some foreign currencies.	1
ClaimBuster	17004				That's really about all we can do.	0
ClaimBuster	17005				The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	17006				It is an issue that I am willing to take on, and so I'll bring Republicans and Democrats together.	0
ClaimBuster	17007				We have differences about how to achieve them.	0
ClaimBuster	17008				I also think that we should give visas to people -- green cards, rather, to people who graduate with skills that we need.	0
ClaimBuster	17009				Unfortunately, almost 300 brave young Marines were killed.	1
ClaimBuster	17010				An African American was my chief economic development officer.	1
ClaimBuster	17011				I think the greatest thing that ever happened to the South was the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the opening up of opportunities - uh to black people - the chance to vote, to hold a job, to buy a house, to go to school, and to participate in public affairs.	0
ClaimBuster	17012				And they figured out that between the tax cut that Governor Reagan is promising the American people, and the tax cut that Jimmy Carter is promising in 198I, his is worth about $122 more.	1
ClaimBuster	17013				I was opposed to the war but I loved my country and we need a president who will bring this country together, not divide it.	0
ClaimBuster	17014				So what we want to do is called opportunity scholarships.	0
ClaimBuster	17015				There's another part of the lopsided economy that we're in today, and that is that these heavy deficits have killed exports and are swamping the Nation with cheap imports.	0
ClaimBuster	17016				"Look, he has now said repeatedly, ""30 years this and 30 years that."""	1
ClaimBuster	17017				That's the kind of economy I want us to see again.	0
ClaimBuster	17018				If you look -- excuse me, Chris -- if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote -- millions, this isn't coming from me -- this is coming from Pew Report and other places -- millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote.	1
ClaimBuster	17019				But I finally did it.	1
ClaimBuster	17020				It at the John doesn't quite realize - he's never held an executive position of that kind.	1
ClaimBuster	17021				That's the way we're going to provide basic health security for all of the citizens of this country of ours.	0
ClaimBuster	17022				Because inside Pakistan, you have a -- a large group of Pashtun that are -- that are Taliban.	1
ClaimBuster	17023				I know the governor is against it, and I know that I'm for it.	0
ClaimBuster	17024				Government spending has gone completely out of control; $10 trillion dollar debt we're giving to our kids, a half-a-trillion dollars we owe China.	1
ClaimBuster	17025				We are energy rich, and coal is one of the great potentials we have.	1
ClaimBuster	17026				If we invest in job training, in child care for those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids don't lose their health benefits when she goes to work, we can help literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of families, to get off of welfare, to become independent and self-sufficient, to be taxpaying citizens, and to improve their lives, the quality of lives, their futures, and the futures of those children.	0
ClaimBuster	17027				It's almost become a way of life.	0
ClaimBuster	17028				But I think it ought to be one of our priorities to work with our European friends to convince them to put troops on the ground.	0
ClaimBuster	17029				And doesn't that prove the point, George, which is that values like family and education and community, decent homes for young people that family on Long Island I visited on Monday where Lou and Betty Tolamo (phonetic) bought a house for some $19,000 back in 1962, have had seven children, they're all making good livings.	1
ClaimBuster	17030				And I recognize I've made some decisions that have caused people to not understand the great values of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	17031				I think what grows the economy is when you get that tax credit that we put in place for your kids going to college.	0
ClaimBuster	17032				What I do is I close corporate loopholes, stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that we're giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	17033				It's one that we will solve and must solve, with a clean and wholesome environment and with a strong America that's strong militarily and economically as we must be, an America that provides strong international leadership because we're true to our values.	0
ClaimBuster	17034				So just to finish on the borders...	0
ClaimBuster	17035				He's been out in the state saying that, in Midwestern states.	1
ClaimBuster	17036				It doesn't help that person in their home if the next door neighbor's house is abandoned.	0
ClaimBuster	17037				I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said, we've got to change this strategy.	1
ClaimBuster	17038				I recognize there are some who just don't seem to care.	0
ClaimBuster	17039				We have a four percent gap between what we pay for treasuries, and what Germany pays for one to five year treasuries.	1
ClaimBuster	17040				And we would have lost a million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	17041				Uh - the lands that Mr. Ford uh - brags about having approved are in Alaska and they are enormous in uh - in size.	1
ClaimBuster	17042				That's exactly what our budget does, but it's driven by strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	17043				So her best help for short term is job retraining, if she was thrown out of work at a defense plant.	0
ClaimBuster	17044				And the reason I want middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes is because middle-income taxpayers have been buried over the past four years.	1
ClaimBuster	17045				It's one of the most consequential elections that we've had.	0
ClaimBuster	17046				That's a large part of your 17 percent increase in Medicare premiums.	1
ClaimBuster	17047				There are always trouble spots in the world, and how those troubled areas are addressed by a President alone in that Oval Office affects our nation directly, the involvement of the United States and also our American interests.	0
ClaimBuster	17048				It covers the majority of the work force.	0
ClaimBuster	17049				He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.	1
ClaimBuster	17050				And we need to promote maternity group homes, which my administration has done.	1
ClaimBuster	17051				Well, to say that the borders are not as protected as they were prior to September the 11th shows he doesn't know the borders.	0
ClaimBuster	17052				When Mr. Ford first became president in - in August of 1974, the first thing he did in - in October was to ask for a $4.7 billion increase in taxes on our people in the midst of the heaviest recession, since uh - since the great depression of nineteen uh - of the 1940s.	1
ClaimBuster	17053				They're aimed at the real problem.	0
ClaimBuster	17054				But we all know that we've still got a lot of work to do.	0
ClaimBuster	17055				He wants you to believe that I can't be president.	0
ClaimBuster	17056				No tax on your savings.	0
ClaimBuster	17057				Now, Governor Romney was a very successful investor.	1
ClaimBuster	17058				Growth is a little over 3 percent now.	1
ClaimBuster	17059				I want high wage, high skill jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	17060				Look, the revenue I get is by more people working, getting higher pay, paying more taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	17061				They don't even fight to reach those goals.	0
ClaimBuster	17062				I ask you to give me the opportunity to lead this great nation, so that we can be stronger here at home, respected again in the world, and have responsible leadership that we deserve.	0
ClaimBuster	17063				Russia is a country in transition.	0
ClaimBuster	17064				And I think, as a part of that process, what I am trying to say will come across, and that is that we must lead, we must command, we must direct, and a President must see it like it is.	0
ClaimBuster	17065				But just a few weeks ago, you said you think we should have more troops in Iraq right now.	1
ClaimBuster	17066				And so I've put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan.	1
ClaimBuster	17067				Those plans are better than this $550 billion tax scheme.	0
ClaimBuster	17068				We must deal with threats before they fully materialize.	0
ClaimBuster	17069				Governor Carter in November of 1975 indicated that he wanted to cut the defense budget by $15 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	17070				There has only been one prosecution under the Brady -- only one under the assault weapon ban and only seven under the Brady Bill that you talk about all the time.	1
ClaimBuster	17071				I think the United States can afford to do these things.	0
ClaimBuster	17072				Let me make it very clear that the bill that Mr. Nixon talked about did not mention Wilkes-Barre or Scranton; it did not mention West Virginia.	1
ClaimBuster	17073				I'm not proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	17074				Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts.	0
ClaimBuster	17075				I was Governor of Georgia for four years.	1
ClaimBuster	17076				We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	17077				It is not the kind of coalition we were described when we were talking about voting for this.	0
ClaimBuster	17078				And so I'm against price controls.	0
ClaimBuster	17079				So in those two cases I think uh - such uh - a constitutional amendment would be proper, and I really don't think in either case they're trivial matters.	0
ClaimBuster	17080				And yet let's just see what we've done for Poland, A half a billion dollars worth of aid has gone to Poland, primarily economic, primarily to go to the people of Poland.	1
ClaimBuster	17081				And I would say that no president should ever allow anybody else to make the major decisions, The president only makes the decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	17082				I do support a national patient's bill of rights.	0
ClaimBuster	17083				You're going to live in a peaceful world.	0
ClaimBuster	17084				Everybody told me they were cost-effective.	0
ClaimBuster	17085				I carry a little card in my pocket called the Tenth Amendment.	1
ClaimBuster	17086				Because the only type of agreements to reach with the Soviet Union are the types that are specifically defined, so we know exactly what they must do; subject to full verification, which means we know every day whether they're living up to it; and followups, wherever we find suggestions that they're violating it; and the strongest possible terms.	1
ClaimBuster	17087				It resulted also in an ability to reshape our court system, our prison system, our education system, our mental health programs and - and a clear assignment of responsibility and - and authority and also to have uh our people once again understanding control our government.	1
ClaimBuster	17088				America has not been standing still.	1
ClaimBuster	17089				He was on 60 Minutes just two weeks ago and he was asked: Is it fair for somebody like you, making $20 million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody making $50,000 year?	1
ClaimBuster	17090				Within the Administration, as a chairman of the President's Committee on Price Stability and Economic Growth, I have had the opportunity to make recommendations which have been adopted within the Administration and which I think have been reasonably effective.	1
ClaimBuster	17091				Now, ladies and gentlemen, important to understand, the president and his friends try to make a big deal out of it.	0
ClaimBuster	17092				I understand that the report today is accurate.	0
ClaimBuster	17093				We're being challenged like never before.	0
ClaimBuster	17094				We cut taxes 19 times and balanced our budget.	1
ClaimBuster	17095				Ann, both of them are very complicated situations.	0
ClaimBuster	17096				And that's one of the things that I hope I can lead personally as the President of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	17097				You can look all around and you'll see first-class strong women.	1
ClaimBuster	17098				I never criticized the U-2 flights in general, however.	1
ClaimBuster	17099				And I would suggest that Congress should hold such an investigation.	0
ClaimBuster	17100				Now, if there was a connection I think that there would be a different parallel between deficits getting larger and interest rates going down.	0
ClaimBuster	17101				That is a big project.	0
ClaimBuster	17102				I don't want to see the day when it's sixty percent of ours, and seventy and seventy-five and eighty and ninety percent of ours, with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	17103				Thanks for your questions tonight, very, very much.	0
ClaimBuster	17104				The federal government can be a part, but don't fall prey to all this stuff about money here and money there because education is really funded at the local level.	1
ClaimBuster	17105				I would say that the issue will stay with us as a campaign issue just as long as Senator Kennedy persists in what I think is a fundamental error.	0
ClaimBuster	17106				And there are other ways of squeezing this budget without constantly picking on our senior citizens and the most vulnerable in American life.	0
ClaimBuster	17107				And thanks to the people of San Diego for giving us this opportunity to have another discussion about the decision we all face in front of people who will make the decision.	0
ClaimBuster	17108				We're aligning facilities where the veterans live now.	1
ClaimBuster	17109				I started off with -- my dad was a small-business man.	1
ClaimBuster	17110				I have questioned his proposals.	0
ClaimBuster	17111				I'm grownup, I can deal with it, I'll pay my share.	0
ClaimBuster	17112				I know how to eliminate programs.	0
ClaimBuster	17113				Also the - the protection of an arrested person against unwarranted persecution in trying to get a false uh - confession.	0
ClaimBuster	17114				My opponent's right, we need good intelligence.	0
ClaimBuster	17115				The average family's income has gone up over $1600 just since our economic plan passed.	1
ClaimBuster	17116				I just don't think it's the role of the United States to walk into a country and say, √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚Äúwe do it this way, so should you.√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù I think we can help.	0
ClaimBuster	17117				Mr. Ford has been there for eighteen months.	1
ClaimBuster	17118				We must have a transition plan to plan to convert from a defense to a domestic economy.	0
ClaimBuster	17119				And I think the press would follow that so closely that probably they would get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	17120				And today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the costs.	1
ClaimBuster	17121				They pulled out after Sergio de Mello got killed.	1
ClaimBuster	17122				But first we must have an aggressive jobs program.	0
ClaimBuster	17123				They are now raiding our troops in Afghanistan, destabilizing the situation.	1
ClaimBuster	17124				First of all, Senator Dole, let's set the record straight.	0
ClaimBuster	17125				Of course, we have to come together.	0
ClaimBuster	17126				In the first place I've never suggested that Cuba was lost except for the present.	1
ClaimBuster	17127				And that's because we've become weaker in each of those four...	0
ClaimBuster	17128				Yeah, I plead guilty to that.	0
ClaimBuster	17129				I don't think they should be allowed to.	0
ClaimBuster	17130				And then you need a philosophical -- I'd call it a philosophical underpinning.	0
ClaimBuster	17131				Well, again, I don't mean to go back and forth, but he...	0
ClaimBuster	17132				And Russia has now become a nation fueled by petro-dollars that is basically a KGB apparatchik-run government.	1
ClaimBuster	17133				And she's out campaigning along with our girls.	1
ClaimBuster	17134				There are sanctions in place on Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	17135				This is a company, this isn't basic research.	0
ClaimBuster	17136				You can't engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk.	0
ClaimBuster	17137				Provided support for some of these people, supported the nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	17138				But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate.	0
ClaimBuster	17139				Number three, we've got to deal with Pakistan, because Al Qaida and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, we've been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens.	1
ClaimBuster	17140				I'm proud of the fact that we hold people accountable.	0
ClaimBuster	17141				Well, obviously, my orientation is let's go do it.	0
ClaimBuster	17142				"To save for Halliburton the spoils of the war, they actually issued a memorandum from the Defense Department saying, ""If you weren't with us in the war, don't bother applying for any construction."""	1
ClaimBuster	17143				And you know what else I prepared for?	0
ClaimBuster	17144				And the tax relief was important to spur consumption and investment to get us out of this recession.	1
ClaimBuster	17145				But I think in all fairness and equity we have to recognize the problem that South Korea has.	0
ClaimBuster	17146				I'm trying to put a leash on them.	0
ClaimBuster	17147				This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important.	0
ClaimBuster	17148				Since I've been President, I've appointed, for instance, more than twice as many black Federal judges as all previous presidents in the history of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	17149				But it's not going to be easy.	0
ClaimBuster	17150				The Oregon plan is a good start if the federal government is going to continue to abandon its responsibilities.	0
ClaimBuster	17151				There is a man here in this audience named Hugo Berlanga.	1
ClaimBuster	17152				My mother basically raised our family.	1
ClaimBuster	17153				Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot.	1
ClaimBuster	17154				Surely we can fight off these laws that will encourage doctors to -- to allow doctors to take the lives of our seniors.	0
ClaimBuster	17155				One-time surge while we build factories and ship machine tools and equipment down there.	0
ClaimBuster	17156				I think it's intolerable that we have so many millions of children without any health insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	17157				I agree with my opponent that we shouldn't be committing troops.	0
ClaimBuster	17158				So I would take my responsibility seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	17159				And I think that's an important transition.	0
ClaimBuster	17160				So if you want to drill on public lands, you use it or you lose it.	0
ClaimBuster	17161				"The No Child Left Behind Act says, ""We'll raise standards."	1
ClaimBuster	17162				That's the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate.	0
ClaimBuster	17163				Is America better off than it was 4 years ago?	0
ClaimBuster	17164				This is an enormous boon for them.	0
ClaimBuster	17165				Then Exxon Mobil, which made $12 billion, record profits, over the last several quarters, they can afford to pay a little more so that ordinary families who are hurting out there -- they're trying to figure out how they're going to afford food, how they're going to save for their kids' college education, they need a break.	1
ClaimBuster	17166				I've been in Washington, D.C., three and a half years and led the Congress to reform Medicare so our seniors have got a modern health care system.	1
ClaimBuster	17167				Ours is a great land, and one of the reasons why is because we're free.	0
ClaimBuster	17168				And the result is interest costs that have never been seen before in terms of real charges, and it's attributable to the deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	17169				Now with respect to Libya, as I indicated in the last debate, when we received that phone call, I immediately made sure that, number one, that we did everything we could to secure those Americans who were still in harm's way; number two, that we would investigate exactly what happened, and number three, most importantly, that we would go after those who killed Americans and we would bring them to justice.	1
ClaimBuster	17170				There are extremists in all parts of the Middle East who want to kill that peace process.	1
ClaimBuster	17171				He's outsmarted her every step of the way.	0
ClaimBuster	17172				Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.	0
ClaimBuster	17173				As long as Vietnam, North Vietnam, does not give us a full and complete accounting of our missing in action, I will never uh - go along with the admission of Vietnam to the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	17174				They didn't get the tanks from this administration because we were nation building.	1
ClaimBuster	17175				Make up a number, $25,000, $50,000.	0
ClaimBuster	17176				Secondly, when we went in, there were three countries: Great Britain, Australia and the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	17177				We need to be stronger on terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	17178				It is hard work to go from a tyranny to a democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	17179				Well, why didn't she change it?	0
ClaimBuster	17180				If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for, $7 trillion -- just to give you a sense, over 10 years, that's more than our entire defense budget -- and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end up picking up the tab, then Governor Romney's plan may work for you.	1
ClaimBuster	17181				But if you feel that we have to move again in the sixties, that the function of the president is to set before the people the unfinished business of our society as Franklin Roosevelt did in the thirties, the agenda for our people - what we must do as a society to meet our needs in this country and protect our security and help the cause of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	17182				I doubt very much that Mr. Bush's selection for the Vice Presidency of the United States meets that test.	0
ClaimBuster	17183				I think you have to look at my record and you have to look at his.	0
ClaimBuster	17184				Well as you take the bills -	0
ClaimBuster	17185				But it's gotten too much.	0
ClaimBuster	17186				I would not wanna destroy the - the independence of the uh Federal Reserve - uh Board.	0
ClaimBuster	17187				That's why I fight for equality and justice.	0
ClaimBuster	17188				We have got to win our national strategy against drugs, the fight against drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	17189				We tend to be reactive.	0
ClaimBuster	17190				And the reason we did this is because a nuclear Iran is a threat to our national security, and it is a threat to Israel's national security.	0
ClaimBuster	17191				When he came, after giving a speech to the Congress, my opponent questioned his credibility.	1
ClaimBuster	17192				"And his answer was, ""With a viable exit strategy and only with enough forces to get the job done."""	1
ClaimBuster	17193				I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia.	0
ClaimBuster	17194				Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually.	1
ClaimBuster	17195				The United States is leading the free world out of the recession that was serious a year, year and a half ago.	1
ClaimBuster	17196				There was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade.	1
ClaimBuster	17197				I think the American people want it now.	0
ClaimBuster	17198				All these programs - and this cost on his - is - was - I saw an estimate, I'd love to know what he thinks, $35 - $40 billion - and it seems to me that somebody pays that.	0
ClaimBuster	17199				All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out.	1
ClaimBuster	17200				Maybe we can make a deal here tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	17201				Veterans are getting very good health care under my administration, and they will continue to do so during the next four years.	1
ClaimBuster	17202				We could speed it up.	0
ClaimBuster	17203				What tools do we need to fight us?	0
ClaimBuster	17204				The US should try to work with its allies and stop it.	0
ClaimBuster	17205				In each instance, our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	17206				Hillary wants to give amnesty.	1
ClaimBuster	17207				and that's where you begin.	0
ClaimBuster	17208				And all of you in the press know exactly what I'm talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	17209				I was in uh - a city in uh - Pennsylvania not too long ago, near here, and uh - there were about four or five thousand people in the audience - it was on a - on a train trip.	1
ClaimBuster	17210				I indicated that I would defend those islands if the attack were directed against Pescadores and Formosa, which is part of the Eisenhower policy.	1
ClaimBuster	17211				I'm very proud of him.	0
ClaimBuster	17212				Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic.	0
ClaimBuster	17213				This is -- this is a mindset.	0
ClaimBuster	17214				It's a very effective way of communication.	0
ClaimBuster	17215				And now the Soviet Union seems to be walking down that same path.	0
ClaimBuster	17216				Well, he was wrong then and he's wrong now.	0
ClaimBuster	17217				Now, we went into south Africa late, after Great Britain, Rhodesia, the black nations had been trying to solve this problem for many, many years.	1
ClaimBuster	17218				And in this instance the good intentions, of course, are a desire for peace.	0
ClaimBuster	17219				But I'm going to make an important point here, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	17220				Senator McCain and I disagreed recently when the Supreme Court made it more difficult for a woman named Lilly Ledbetter to press her claim for pay discrimination.	1
ClaimBuster	17221				It is because we are in the grip of a failed economic theory.	0
ClaimBuster	17222				But I think that the important point is we've got to have a president who understands the benefits of free trade but also is going to enforce unfair trade agreements and is going to stand up to other countries.	0
ClaimBuster	17223				Surely, there are things that we can do in the retrofitting, ;n the redesign of our homes, not only of our houses, but of our commercial structures, as well, that will make it possible for us to achieve.	0
ClaimBuster	17224				He said in Cincinnati we would plan carefully, we would take every precaution.	1
ClaimBuster	17225				I may have been misled by all the news reports about this matter, because the law that was proposed in Texas that had the support of the Byrd family and a whole lot of people in Texas did, in fact, die in committee.	1
ClaimBuster	17226				But, Andrea, I think we can go far beyond this as well, because we have opportunities now step-by-step to bring down the level of strategic weapons, get a test ban treaty, negotiate those conventional force reductions.	0
ClaimBuster	17227				And I'm for enforcing laws on the books.	0
ClaimBuster	17228				It's going to destabilize the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	17229				We need a strong, credible, effective nuclear deterrent.	0
ClaimBuster	17230				And the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military and so forth.	0
ClaimBuster	17231				And if we're not making investments in education and basic research, which is not something that the private sector is doing at a sufficient pace right now and has never done, then we will lose the (inaudible) in things like clean energy technology.	1
ClaimBuster	17232				And what's interesting is, it's a threat that has grown while the president has been preoccupied with Iraq, where there wasn't a threat.	0
ClaimBuster	17233				Not at all Because these are determined men.	0
ClaimBuster	17234				And motorists are using 8% less than they were back at that time of the oil embargo.	1
ClaimBuster	17235				You see our five kids, all over this country, and their spouses.	0
ClaimBuster	17236				And we also have planned a youth employment program which would encompass 600,000 jobs for young people.	1
ClaimBuster	17237				But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	17238				And it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking.	0
ClaimBuster	17239				It has some good provisions in it.	0
ClaimBuster	17240				I don't think this has worked in the past; I do not think it will work in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	17241				His own secretary of commerce had to be subpoenaed by the Congress to reveal the names of businesses who were subject to this boycott.	1
ClaimBuster	17242				Build a whole bunch of them, create millions of new jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	17243				I supported the V-chip so that parents would be able to control what their kids watch on television when they're young, along with the ratings systems for television and educational television.	1
ClaimBuster	17244				And if we'd used smart diplomacy, we could have saved $200 billion and an invasion of Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	17245				We have got to deal with long-term care.	0
ClaimBuster	17246				Then from World War I to World War II we had sort of a compulsory engagement policy.	1
ClaimBuster	17247				I promise it's less than 10 seconds.	0
ClaimBuster	17248				I vowed to our countrymen that I would do everything I could to protect the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	17249				But let's look at the overall record.	0
ClaimBuster	17250				Inflation is the quickest way to destroy jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	17251				We in this country can -- can compete successfully with anyone in the world, and we're going to.	0
ClaimBuster	17252				I think it's in the best interest of the United States, and the world as a whole that the United States negotiate rather than go back to the cold-war relationship with the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	17253				May I ask you a question?	0
ClaimBuster	17254				So I'd rather talk about my strengths.	0
ClaimBuster	17255				Governor Carter's answer tonight does not coincide with the answer that he gave in an interview to the Associated Press a week or so ago.	1
ClaimBuster	17256				And in the years to come it will be written that one or the other of us was elected and that he was or was not a great president.	0
ClaimBuster	17257				And thank God, the freeze people were not heard.	0
ClaimBuster	17258				Well first of all, I think Senator Kennedy should make up his mind with regard to my responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	17259				I'll restore the vitality that gets America working again.	0
ClaimBuster	17260				And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals.	0
ClaimBuster	17261				And I'll tell you one place that's working well, and that is the private sector -- Jim Burke and this task force that he has, you may know about it.	0
ClaimBuster	17262				Now, they claim they're not.	1
ClaimBuster	17263				I don't think we can be all things to all people in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	17264				The warning signs are clear.	0
ClaimBuster	17265				And he just called for new elections.	1
ClaimBuster	17266				Well, Mr. Greenberg, I simply cannot allow to go unpassed the statements that have just been made by Mr. Reagan, who once again, has demonstrated, I think, a total misunderstanding of the energy crisis that confronts, not only this country, but the world, when he suggests that we have 27 years' supply of natural gas, 47 years' supply of oil, and all the rest, and that we really.	0
ClaimBuster	17267				As a matter of fact, Iran is gonna get eighty F-14s before we even meet our own Air Force orders for F-l4s.	1
ClaimBuster	17268				We must rebuild America's strength at home.	0
ClaimBuster	17269				We need gas pipelines to bring the gas down.	0
ClaimBuster	17270				If there's a fairer way, I'm all ears (laughter) --aah.	0
ClaimBuster	17271				The warhead principle -- there have been counting rules for years.	0
ClaimBuster	17272				I can't give you a specific answer on Pension Guarantee Fund.	0
ClaimBuster	17273				We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are.	0
ClaimBuster	17274				all we have to do is to get the Government off the back of the oil industry, and that's going to be enough.	0
ClaimBuster	17275				But we've got to do even better.	0
ClaimBuster	17276				In our first debate he indicated that I had not had experience or at least uh - had not participated significantly in the making of the decisions.	1
ClaimBuster	17277				And there is ,so much trust has broken down in the aftermath of the change of government.	0
ClaimBuster	17278				I wouldn't be called a conservative if I were.	0
ClaimBuster	17279				Other members on that board were the presidents of the University of Illinois, the president of Northwestern University, who happens to be a Republican, the president of The Chicago Tribune, a Republican- leaning newspaper.	1
ClaimBuster	17280				We're all God's children, Bob.	0
ClaimBuster	17281				And this calls into question the president's whole policy in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	17282				No, I don't, and I'm not going to go to calling names on his facts.	0
ClaimBuster	17283				We differ on whether or not pollution controls ought to be voluntary.	1
ClaimBuster	17284				The safety net is there, and we're taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	17285				And that's why we've got a country with ten and a half million more jobs, and record numbers of new businesses, and rising incomes, and falling crime rates, and welfare roll rates.	1
ClaimBuster	17286				Let's look at the vote on Hungary.	0
ClaimBuster	17287				And then, through tax incentives, induce the creation of businesses providing jobs and so forth in those areas.	0
ClaimBuster	17288				I believe the role of the military is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	17289				A great historian, Henry Steele Commager, said that in their lust for victory, neither traditional party is looking beyond November.	1
ClaimBuster	17290				And as a matter of fact, the system that the administration is now talking about is very different from the one that was originally proposed in 1983.	1
ClaimBuster	17291				It also means it takes pressure off the border.	0
ClaimBuster	17292				There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective.	0
ClaimBuster	17293				In my tax reduction program for middle-income taxpayers, I recommended that the Congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars per person.	1
ClaimBuster	17294				In the second century of our nation's history, our forefathers developed the most productive industrial nation in the history of the globe.	0
ClaimBuster	17295				My opponent talks about me not signing certain treaties.	1
ClaimBuster	17296				Our neighbors here in America are vital to us.	0
ClaimBuster	17297				I think that we have to put more emphasis on early learning and pre-school.	0
ClaimBuster	17298				You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise.	0
ClaimBuster	17299				We're talking about failures on Main Street, and people who will lose their jobs, and their credits, and their homes, if we don't fix the greatest fiscal crisis, probably in -- certainly in our time, and I've been around a little while.	0
ClaimBuster	17300				And the cost in unemployment compensation, welfare compensation, and lost revenues has increased $23 billion in the last two years.	1
ClaimBuster	17301				My wife, Michelle, is there and she could give you a much longer list than I do.	1
ClaimBuster	17302				Now, see, we practice 19th century capitalism.	0
ClaimBuster	17303				The American people are healed, are working together.	0
ClaimBuster	17304				I want to get us on track to a balanced budget, and I'm going to reduce the tax burden on middle income families.	1
ClaimBuster	17305				Now, if you're a Red Sox fan, that's OK.	0
ClaimBuster	17306				I know what it takes to get this country back, and will work with good Democrats and good Republicans to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	17307				Somehow we've lost that accountability.	0
ClaimBuster	17308				We do it by getting -- by reducing spending in a whole series of programs.	0
ClaimBuster	17309				That's why it's important to make sure our alliances are as strong as they possibly can be to keep the pressure on Mr. Milosevic.	0
ClaimBuster	17310				And any research or development along the Star Wars schemes would inevitably involve our most advanced computers, our most advanced engineering.	0
ClaimBuster	17311				They appointed a commission I was on that commission.	1
ClaimBuster	17312				And we know what happened.	0
ClaimBuster	17313				First question is what's in the best interests of the United States?	0
ClaimBuster	17314				I said that we would put in place health care reform to make sure that insurance companies can't jerk you around and if you don't have health insurance, that you'd have a chance to get affordable insurance, and I have.	1
ClaimBuster	17315				Well, Mr. uh - Nelson, uh - I testified before two committees, House and Senate, on precisely the questions that you have asked.	1
ClaimBuster	17316				... $200 million is spent, and I'm either winning or tied, and I've spent practically nothing.	1
ClaimBuster	17317				You know, we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana.	1
ClaimBuster	17318				Well, Barbara, I believe that there is a fundamental difference - and I think it has been evident in most of the answers that Mr. Carter has given tonight - that he seeks the solution to anything as another opportunity for a Federal Government program.	0
ClaimBuster	17319				Mr. Ford hasn't moved on this.	1
ClaimBuster	17320				And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan.	1
ClaimBuster	17321				I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day.	1
ClaimBuster	17322				I want to make sure that the Iranians are put enough -- that we put enough pressure on the Iranians by joining with our allies, imposing significant, tough sanctions to modify their behavior.	0
ClaimBuster	17323				But I feel that at this point in our country's history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us.	0
ClaimBuster	17324				Uh - just a moment ago, for example, uh - he uh - was indicating that uh - uh - in the 1950s, for example, uh - unemployment was very low.	0
ClaimBuster	17325				That says something about character.	0
ClaimBuster	17326				But, let's start with Somalia, where they dragged Americans through the streets, and where 18 Americans were killed one day, because they didn't have, they were pinned down for eight hours, the rangers.	1
ClaimBuster	17327				And in 2006, our seniors will get prescription drug coverage.	0
ClaimBuster	17328				Would I understand it if it occurred to me, and I might just say I'm from a large family.	1
ClaimBuster	17329				I have been in the Congress for fourteen years.	1
ClaimBuster	17330				But I'd also like to point out that I haven't been part of what we're criticizing in Washington tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	17331				I'm going to make sure you get a job.	0
ClaimBuster	17332				There has to be revenue in addition to cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	17333				It's an issue I know a lot about.	0
ClaimBuster	17334				I would say I didn't hear what Yassir Arafat had to say, but I don't want to -- you know, I think foreign policy, I want to be very careful about, and I'm not here to argue about the President with some ongoing foreign policy matter.	0
ClaimBuster	17335				These interest rates we have now don't make any sense.	0
ClaimBuster	17336				But as far as special rights, I'm opposed to same-sex marriages, which the President signed well after midnight one morning in the dark of night.	1
ClaimBuster	17337				What I have said is that the president ought to have a chance to appoint a chairman of the Federal Reserve Board to have a coterminous uh term; in other words, both of 'em serve the same four - four years.	1
ClaimBuster	17338				I want to make sure the seniors have the promise made will be a promise kept, but I want younger workers to be able to manage some of their own money, some of their own payroll taxes in the private sector under certain guidelines to get a better rate of return on your own money.	0
ClaimBuster	17339				And let me tell you one specific pilot program where children who don't have a chance go to this program when they're 3.	0
ClaimBuster	17340				Family medical leave has let 12 million families take a little time off for the birth of a child or a family illness without losing their job.	1
ClaimBuster	17341				I trust people, I don't trust the federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	17342				Now, I think that's going back to where we started.	0
ClaimBuster	17343				And, unfortunately, he didn't go to war as a last resort.	1
ClaimBuster	17344				I don't think there's any question that the automobile executives made some errors in the 1980s, but I also think we should look at how much productivity has increased lately, how much labor has done to increase productivity and how much management has done.	0
ClaimBuster	17345				But we're going to have to have the courage and the sacrifice, the nerve to move in a new direction.	0
ClaimBuster	17346				We know what a treasure and joy it is to have an adopted child in our lives.	0
ClaimBuster	17347				Our laws against murder are State laws.	1
ClaimBuster	17348				$500 per child under 18.	1
ClaimBuster	17349				"And in the middle of the discussion, to tell them about the missiles in Cuba, he said, ""Here, let me show you the photos."""	1
ClaimBuster	17350				Someone who will not veto a bill that has an investment tax credit, middle class tax relief, research and development tax credits as Mr. Bush has done.	1
ClaimBuster	17351				I want to streamline the approval of the competing generic drugs and the new kinds of treatments that can compete with them so we bring the price down for everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	17352				And this is what we're trying to work out, not only to protect our own borders but to have some kind of fairness and recognition of that problem.	0
ClaimBuster	17353				But I have uh - an adequate background, I believe.	0
ClaimBuster	17354				I'm going to make sure that we get people off of food stamps, not by cutting the program, but by getting them good jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	17355				But the thing that is right about the United States, it should be emphasized, is that less people go to bed hungry in the United States than in any major country in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	17356				That raises, he says $800 billion; we say $600 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	17357				And it's up in some cases because both parents are working.	1
ClaimBuster	17358				For every new dollar that I propose for spending on health care, Governor Bush spends $3 for a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%.	1
ClaimBuster	17359				They don't want ISIS, but they have other things, because we're backing -- we're backing rebels.	1
ClaimBuster	17360				Well, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul.	1
ClaimBuster	17361				And I've had to fight a lot of people that were saying human rights, and we√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢re the ones that put the sanctions on and stood for it.	1
ClaimBuster	17362				Unfortunately, he escaped in the mountains of Tora Bora.	1
ClaimBuster	17363				Now today the Secretary of State is in the Middle East and they've started negotiations and all those leaders promised me they would not quit until they resolved the issues between them and got the peace process going forward again.	1
ClaimBuster	17364				And as far as nuclear power is concerned, again, look at the record.	0
ClaimBuster	17365				It's just not credible to say he's going to keep taxes down and balance budgets.	0
ClaimBuster	17366				Iran is taking over Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	17367				He said he's for -- you're now for capping punitive damages?	0
ClaimBuster	17368				My objection here is not the cost in dollars.	0
ClaimBuster	17369				But in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put -- provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda.	0
ClaimBuster	17370				And so I made the decision we wouldn't spend any more money beyond the 70 lines, 22 of which are now in action, because science is important, but so is ethics, so is balancing life.	1
ClaimBuster	17371				When I came back from that war I saw that it was wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	17372				When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	17373				We can only be strong overseas if we're strong at home; and when I became president we'll not only be strong in those areas but also in defense - a defense capability second to none.	0
ClaimBuster	17374				I didn't always agree with their decisions, whether they were Democratic or Republican presidents.	1
ClaimBuster	17375				Making sure that we're bringing manufacturing back to our shores so that we're creating jobs here, as we've done with the auto industry, not rewarding companies that are shipping jobs overseas.	1
ClaimBuster	17376				His has been in the legislative branch.	1
ClaimBuster	17377				They don't want to raise the minimum wage.	0
ClaimBuster	17378				It was festooned with Christmas tree ornaments.	1
ClaimBuster	17379				Those Sandinistas came in and betrayed the trust of the revolution; they said it was about democracy, and they have done nothing other than solidify their Marxist domination over that country.	0
ClaimBuster	17380				I don't see how the Iraqis are going to have confidence in the American president if all they hear is that it was a mistake to be there in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	17381				I appreciate your listening tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	17382				They didn't tell you that that same year they increased spending $1.83 for every dollar we increased taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	17383				I want to make sure we keep our Pell grant program growing.	0
ClaimBuster	17384				And I also have to disagree on Senator McCain's record when it comes to college accessibility and affordability.	0
ClaimBuster	17385				Look, this is a funding crisis all around the country.	1
ClaimBuster	17386				They just decided the time for diplomacy is over and rushed to war without planning for what happens afterwards.	0
ClaimBuster	17387				What we need to do is empower people.	0
ClaimBuster	17388				And why hasn't she made the agreements better?	0
ClaimBuster	17389				But in the final analysis-in the final analysis, the person goes into that voting booth, they're going to say, √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬∞√Ç¬•Who has the values I believe in?	0
ClaimBuster	17390				I do believe that there's some fairly good news out there.	0
ClaimBuster	17391				That it was placed here to be found by a special kind of people - people who had a special love for freedom and who had the courage to uproot themselves and leave hearth and homeland, and came to what, in the beginning, was the most undeveloped wilderness possible.	0
ClaimBuster	17392				You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals.	0
ClaimBuster	17393				And getting back to this matter that we discussed at the outset, the matter of Quemoy and Matsu.	0
ClaimBuster	17394				I'm convinced that the result of this would be that people who are Hispanic, people who have different languages or speak with an accent, would find it difficult to be employed.	0
ClaimBuster	17395				She's raising your taxes really high.	0
ClaimBuster	17396				I believe strongly we should d- do so in Formosa and I believe we should meet our commitments to every country whose security we've guaranteed.	0
ClaimBuster	17397				But I would have used that force wisely, I would have used that authority wisely, not rushed to war without a plan to win the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	17398				Thank you Barbara (barely audible).	0
ClaimBuster	17399				My argument with him on -- the question was about the draft -- is that there's this same pattern.	0
ClaimBuster	17400				I hope the FDA took its time to make sure that American women will be safe who use this drug.	0
ClaimBuster	17401				I selected a man who stands with me in this field and who will talk with me and work with me on it.	0
ClaimBuster	17402				Well, I'll tell you exactly why not, but I first want to say something about those sanctions on Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	17403				This election is about two different visions about how we should go into the 21st Century.	0
ClaimBuster	17404				The second thing we need is to crack down on illegal hiring.	0
ClaimBuster	17405				And at his pace, it will take 13 years to secure those weapons in Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	17406				They have a variety of choices to choose, so should seniors.	1
ClaimBuster	17407				...you've had the floor for a while.	1
ClaimBuster	17408				What we are talking about is recognizing that the next president has to have a broader strategic vision about all the challenges that we face.	0
ClaimBuster	17409				The first thing is, everybody 25,000 and under would have no tax increase.	1
ClaimBuster	17410				In fact he is on Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	17411				But not by raising taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	17412				Many of the countries below that used to say, well, this is the US' problem -- if you'd get the demand down, then we wouldn't have the problem -- are working cooperatively with the DEA and the military.	1
ClaimBuster	17413				Well, my blood pressure is lower, my weight, my cholesterol, but I will not make health an issue in this campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	17414				And in the '60s, he wrote letter after letter to come to college here in the United States because the notion was that there was no other country on Earth where you could make it if you tried.	1
ClaimBuster	17415				We ought to be working with the African Union to do so -- precisely what we did in Liberia.	0
ClaimBuster	17416				And so we began a new dialogue with North Korea, one that included not only the United States, but now China.	1
ClaimBuster	17417				The border -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me.	1
ClaimBuster	17418				All they've got to show for 4 years in U.S.-Soviet relations is one meeting in the last weeks of an administration, and nothing before.	1
ClaimBuster	17419				I don't take it personally.	0
ClaimBuster	17420				What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time.	0
ClaimBuster	17421				Is the United States standing still?	0
ClaimBuster	17422				And then let's focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2,500 additional premium.	0
ClaimBuster	17423				I have worked in my state to reduce teen pregnancy and illness among children.	1
ClaimBuster	17424				I'll do everything I can as president to stop the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries.	0
ClaimBuster	17425				We're going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.	0
ClaimBuster	17426				First of all, I would quit conducting the decision-making process in secret, as has been a characteristic of Mr. Kissinger and Mr. Ford.	0
ClaimBuster	17427				First of all, let me say what we have done.	0
ClaimBuster	17428				It means that there will be a reduction in the uhh - unemployment.	0
ClaimBuster	17429				The reason I have opposed that initiative is because I'm afraid it will end those extra effort programs.	0
ClaimBuster	17430				Well, first of all, I think it's important for the American public to understand that the $750 billion rescue package, if it's structured properly, and, as president, I will make sure it's structured properly, means that ultimately taxpayers get their money back, and that's important to understand.	1
ClaimBuster	17431				They've appropriated about $200 million, but only spent about $3 million to get it underway.	1
ClaimBuster	17432				I think, too, that it should be pointed out that of course it is not possible, particularly under the proposals that Senator Kennedy has advocated, either to cut the national debt or to reduce taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	17433				Yes, we should make every effort to try to help those hostages come home, but it can never be because we make concessions.	0
ClaimBuster	17434				I met Grant Milliron, Mansfield, Ohio.	1
ClaimBuster	17435				Right now all the president is providing is humanitarian support.	1
ClaimBuster	17436				I think it's important for us to be training Columbians in that part of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	17437				I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.	0
ClaimBuster	17438				This is something that we can do; the Congress failed to do it, and we intend to do it.	1
ClaimBuster	17439				But if you look at public education alone and you take into account the fact that we have more racial diversity and more poverty, it makes a big difference.	1
ClaimBuster	17440				We can't I think adjust spending around to take care of the very much needed programs, including taking care of our veterans but I also want to say again a healthy economy with low taxes would not raising anyone's taxes is probably the best recipe for eventually having our economy recover.	0
ClaimBuster	17441				And I think the housing community is ready.	0
ClaimBuster	17442				In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health care system, which the vice president opposes, I think very unwisely.	1
ClaimBuster	17443				They don't want you to help them anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	17444				But -- but the right -- the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance of our people and states, not the federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	17445				It was a beautiful moment and I think she'll do a first-class job on that commission.	0
ClaimBuster	17446				Mr. Drummond, I am never satisfied with the economic growth of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	17447				I can't promise that I will never get another detail wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	17448				Asking the wealthy to pay a little bit more along with cuts so that we can invest in education like yours.	0
ClaimBuster	17449				The -- here are the facts.	0
ClaimBuster	17450				... the small businesses we're talking about...	0
ClaimBuster	17451				There is a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	17452				It needs to be competent.	0
ClaimBuster	17453				We're going to have to put in place a very comprehensive and robust strategy to help the -- the world of Islam and other parts of the world, reject this radical violent extremism, which is -- it's certainly not on the run.	0
ClaimBuster	17454				We've spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the hundred years of the Agricultural Department before that.	1
ClaimBuster	17455				First of all √É‚Äö I want to make it clear, our military is the strongest, best-trained, best-equipped, best-led fighting force in the world and in the history of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	17456				Therefore, I think the question before the American people is: Are we doing as much as we can do?	0
ClaimBuster	17457				Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.	0
ClaimBuster	17458				Our government is that point now.	0
ClaimBuster	17459				You know, children listen to what is being said.	0
ClaimBuster	17460				It's time for government, industry, labor, manufacturing, agriculture, education, other entities in our society to cooperate.	0
ClaimBuster	17461				I want you to notice how the president switched away from jobs and started talking about education principally.	1
ClaimBuster	17462				We sign a peace treaty.	1
ClaimBuster	17463				And I've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.	1
ClaimBuster	17464				And I'm -- I'm -- understand why Senator Obama was surprised and said that the surge succeeded beyond his wildest expectations.	1
ClaimBuster	17465				Number one, we've got to get the debt down to get the interest rates down so the economy will grow and people will be employed.	0
ClaimBuster	17466				And it would also be very disturbing to our allies, all of whom support this nuclear arms treaty.	0
ClaimBuster	17467				There are now a large number of Afghan Security Forces, 350,000 that are ready to step in to provide security and we're going to be able to make that transition by the end of 2014.	1
ClaimBuster	17468				If we're saving money and depriving people of care, that's a bad thing.	0
ClaimBuster	17469				Apparently you can't pass any test under his vision of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	17470				This is a big issue.	0
ClaimBuster	17471				I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you.	1
ClaimBuster	17472				I guess the one thing that concerns me about this, Ann, is this attempt to label things which all of us believe in.	0
ClaimBuster	17473				Our military is assisting in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	17474				And if we can't, we're going to do it -- we're going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	17475				This keeps up with technology.	0
ClaimBuster	17476				So, the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the catastrophic program.	0
ClaimBuster	17477				So in other words, it's pretty divided during the 1990s as well.	1
ClaimBuster	17478				I said that the E-Verify portion of the Arizona law, which is -- which is the portion of the law which says that employers could be able to determine whether someone is here illegally or not illegally, that that was a model for the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	17479				We need to continue the negotiations to reduce the nuclear arsenals in the Soviet Union, the former Soviet Union, and the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	17480				Let's take your warhead principle.	0
ClaimBuster	17481				That's why they had to close down the subway in New York when the Republican Convention was there.	1
ClaimBuster	17482				I looked at the slowest growth in the century.	1
ClaimBuster	17483				I went my way because it was obvious we had a complete disagreement about what should be done with the company.	1
ClaimBuster	17484				Russia is new in terms of nuclear.	0
ClaimBuster	17485				On April 17 he said he'd bring out all the records on the draft.	1
ClaimBuster	17486				And it includes within it a number of provisions that I think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	17487				Now, I speak with some confidence of our plan, because I took over a state - California - 10% of the population of this nation - a state that, if it were a nation, would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	17488				Did we inflict any damage?	0
ClaimBuster	17489				But I disagree with them, as do many.	0
ClaimBuster	17490				But I also share your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters don't belong on our streets.	0
ClaimBuster	17491				And I was glad to hear him say that, because that's what we've been doing ever since I announced to the British Parliament that I thought we should do this.	1
ClaimBuster	17492				We've got an aggressive brown field program to refurbish inner-city sore spots to useful pieces of property.	1
ClaimBuster	17493				It's from $4000 to about $2000.	1
ClaimBuster	17494				This is a big spender.	1
ClaimBuster	17495				And the government doesn't create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	17496				Now, Jim, let me get it out.	0
ClaimBuster	17497				It still goes on, I would assume, on both sides.	0
ClaimBuster	17498				That's what the economists tell us.	1
ClaimBuster	17499				Just one last point I want to make, since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5,000 health credit.	1
ClaimBuster	17500				It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.	0
ClaimBuster	17501				But that is an extra $4 billion that would uh - add to the deficit which would add to the inflationary pressures, which would help to destroy jobs in the private sector - not make jobs, where the jobs really are.	1
ClaimBuster	17502				But I'm somebody who believes very strongly in taking care of the fundamentals first before you start new stuff.	0
ClaimBuster	17503				We've done it in Arkansas.	1
ClaimBuster	17504				And I think we have a powerful country.	0
ClaimBuster	17505				And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business.	0
ClaimBuster	17506				As a matter of fact, I think when Gallup ran their first poll in December of 1975 they didn't put my name on the list.	1
ClaimBuster	17507				Because I mean it when I say I want a kinder and gentler nation.	0
ClaimBuster	17508				But the dynamics of the economy - we cut the taxes and revenues are up by 25 percent in three years.	1
ClaimBuster	17509				I don't know if you have to be a paperwork filler-outer, but most of it's because of the federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	17510				Bob, I just need to comment on this.	0
ClaimBuster	17511				I know what it takes to get this economy going.	0
ClaimBuster	17512				The immediate problem we have is to stimulate our economy now so that we can get rid of unemployment.	0
ClaimBuster	17513				And I would also restore the involvement of the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	17514				I'm not going to continue trying to respond to these repetitions of the falsehoods that have already been stated here.	0
ClaimBuster	17515				Small businesses across America will have to cut jobs and will have their taxes increase and won't be able to hire because of Senator Obama's tax policies.	0
ClaimBuster	17516				I'm going to help the African-Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	17517				But where we're not making it is with the confirmed addicts.	0
ClaimBuster	17518				Now, what I've done throughout this campaign is to propose a net spending cut.	1
ClaimBuster	17519				And I ask you to give me the opportunity to make you proud.	0
ClaimBuster	17520				But we've got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work.	0
ClaimBuster	17521				In fact we've seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesn't think we need more teachers.	1
ClaimBuster	17522				What will be done to provide equality of education in all sections of the United States?	0
ClaimBuster	17523				And I can go on and on.	0
ClaimBuster	17524				I was over running records in west Texas, and I got a call from her, come home; went to the doctor; the doctor said, beautiful child, your child has a few weeks to live.	1
ClaimBuster	17525				So he's replaced by Mary Fisher who electrified the Republican Convention by talking about the compassion and the concern that we feel.	0
ClaimBuster	17526				Well, let me just make a couple of points.	0
ClaimBuster	17527				put that tax on here at home, reduce our consumption of that imported oil.	0
ClaimBuster	17528				They've got a lot of concerns.	0
ClaimBuster	17529				But anybody who suggests that that program would c- come to any figure indicated by the Vice President is in error.	0
ClaimBuster	17530				Nor has he indicated that he will support Title Three, which would give the Attorney General additional powers to protect Constitutional rights.	1
ClaimBuster	17531				In other words, you say to a youngster, it will be in your financial interest to start saving for future illness, but for the working folks that do want to have health care that can't afford it, a couple of things we need to do.	0
ClaimBuster	17532				Well, I guess I'm reminded a little bit of what Will Rogers once said about Hoover.	0
ClaimBuster	17533				Well, I think we're getting better all the time.	0
ClaimBuster	17534				And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them.	0
ClaimBuster	17535				Have you seen what's happening to Aleppo?	0
ClaimBuster	17536				When I came into office, the world was divided.	0
ClaimBuster	17537				He goes out and says the man is questioning my patriotism.	0
ClaimBuster	17538				He hasn't done that either.	1
ClaimBuster	17539				Let me give you a prime example.	0
ClaimBuster	17540				And, therefore, I don't feel -- and my minister knows this and supports me in this position -- I don't feel that I have a right to go to church, knowing that my being there could cause something of the kind that we have seen in other places, in Beirut, for example.	0
ClaimBuster	17541				We have to work on a collaborative basis, not because we're going to compromise our principle, but because there's common ground.	0
ClaimBuster	17542				And the proof is our oil imports are down to the lowest levels in 20 years.	1
ClaimBuster	17543				It was a moment ago and I didn't get a chance to, when he was describing Chinese investments and so forth.	0
ClaimBuster	17544				I want to begin by saying again how much I respect Senator Dole and his record of public service and how hard I will try to make this campaign and this debate one of ideas, not insults.	0
ClaimBuster	17545				This was last August, a year ago.	1
ClaimBuster	17546				Look, if Ross were right when we get a free trade agreement with Mexico, why wouldn't they have gone down there now?	0
ClaimBuster	17547				And we are now reletting them so that we can actually make a profit.	1
ClaimBuster	17548				So you can't blame the practitioners for the health problem.	0
ClaimBuster	17549				But you can't just do it by cutting Medicare; you have to take on the insurance companies, the bureaucracies.	0
ClaimBuster	17550				I want a country where people who work hard and play by the rules are rewarded, not punished.	0
ClaimBuster	17551				Well, you know, Senator McCain, in the last debate and today, again, suggested that I don't understand.	1
ClaimBuster	17552				And we have a Fed that's doing political things.	0
ClaimBuster	17553				I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem.	0
ClaimBuster	17554				Think about it: They're going from tyranny to elections.	0
ClaimBuster	17555				And I'm really glad that the premiums have started -- at least the people see what's happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can't get any worse.	1
ClaimBuster	17556				And Senator Obama is parsing words when he says precondition means preparation.	0
ClaimBuster	17557				We've allocated $7 billion over the next months for reconstruction efforts.	1
ClaimBuster	17558				"And suddenly somebody says, ""Oh, it's got to be up there, and it's Star Wars,'' and so forth."	1
ClaimBuster	17559				The voluntary national testing is in addition to the mandatory testing that we require of states.	1
ClaimBuster	17560				And I have said freely, all over this country, that it was a mistake for me or anyone to ever try to put the Judeo-Christian heritage of this country, important as it is, and important as my religious faith is to me - it's a very deeply personal matter.	1
ClaimBuster	17561				I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing.	1
ClaimBuster	17562				I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.	0
ClaimBuster	17563				Well, let me tell you straight up: I've never changed my mind about Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	17564				I worked to get $400 million just a couple of weeks ago.	1
ClaimBuster	17565				I'll take a few days off and hold hands with you and get this airlines thing straightened, because that's important to this country.	0
ClaimBuster	17566				We have seen premature births that are now grown-up, happy people going around.	1
ClaimBuster	17567				But she works for me.	1
ClaimBuster	17568				See, divided teams lose; united teams win.	0
ClaimBuster	17569				Earlier, Governor Romney talked about he wants to make Pell Grants and other education accessible for young people.	1
ClaimBuster	17570				The last thing we need to do is to go back to the very same policies that got us there.	0
ClaimBuster	17571				"Join us for a war that is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time?"""	0
ClaimBuster	17572				I saw them work, I saw them make very hard decisions.	1
ClaimBuster	17573				Let's -- let's pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures they've -- they've engaged in.	0
ClaimBuster	17574				I want to develop the coal resources in America.	0
ClaimBuster	17575				We need to put one person in charge of the battle against AIDS to cut across all the agencies that deal with it.	0
ClaimBuster	17576				And that's what we need, I think, in this election.	0
ClaimBuster	17577				And even when it finally got near passage, Senator Kennedy held it up for 100 days, because he wasn't satisfied with one provision.	1
ClaimBuster	17578				But what I've also said is let's hire another 100,000 math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed.	1
ClaimBuster	17579				I'm well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.	1
ClaimBuster	17580				But she does fight hard, and she doesn't quit, and she doesn't give up.	0
ClaimBuster	17581				Number one, if I get there, it will be a very unusual and historical event --	0
ClaimBuster	17582				We provide the leadership and we're going to have to continue to provide the leadership, but let's do it on our terms when our interests are involved and not when somebody blows the whistle at the United Nations.	0
ClaimBuster	17583				Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	17584				She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there.	0
ClaimBuster	17585				The American middle-class family isn't making it right now, Bob.	0
ClaimBuster	17586				You didn't hear what I said.	0
ClaimBuster	17587				All over the world, people are being torn apart -- Bosnia, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Rwanda, Burundi -- you name it -- because of all their differences.	0
ClaimBuster	17588				The last point is that the major - uh thrust has gotta be to put people back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	17589				Governor Reagan and his new Republican Party have departed from this commitment - a very severe blow to the opportunity for women to finally correct discrimination under which they have suffered.	0
ClaimBuster	17590				so I think we will wait, see what they present, take a look at it.	0
ClaimBuster	17591				But when you were a candidate in 2008, as I was, and I said if I got bin Laden in our sights I would take that shot, you said we shouldn't move heaven and earth to get one man.	1
ClaimBuster	17592				The goal is for every single child to learn to Read.	0
ClaimBuster	17593				-- this was a spontaneous --	0
ClaimBuster	17594				Well, Anne, let me just say before I answer your question that I didn't know that the Vice President attacked our program in Massachusetts.	1
ClaimBuster	17595				Social Security is a trust fund that pays the checks this year with the money that is paid into Social Security this year.	1
ClaimBuster	17596				I think it's a disgrace.	0
ClaimBuster	17597				There are we certainly ought to be able to	0
ClaimBuster	17598				Programs like Project Exile where the federal government intensifies arresting people who illegally use guns.	1
ClaimBuster	17599				The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh - surpluses - nine billion dollars worth.	1
ClaimBuster	17600				I hope that before we do meet, there will be preliminary agreements on those four questions, or at least two of them, or even one of them, which would warrant such a meeting.	0
ClaimBuster	17601				We right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system.	1
ClaimBuster	17602				You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	17603				One of the reasons -- or one of the ways they don't play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency.	1
ClaimBuster	17604				This is a man whose plan excludes 50 million Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	17605				And we have got to again lead by example and help these other countries that are trying to straighten out their situations find the tools in order to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	17606				I'm concerned about the fact that so many of our securities are in the hands of foreign banks because of these massive deficits.	1
ClaimBuster	17607				We have uh - in this last uh two years alone a hundred and twenty billion dollars total deficits under President Ford and uh - at the same time we've had, in the last eight years, a doubling in the number of bankruptcies for small business: we've had a negative growth in our - in our national economy measured in real dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	17608				We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won't take more Medicare patients.	1
ClaimBuster	17609				So, I'm all for pipelines.	0
ClaimBuster	17610				My hope is that the African Union moves rapidly to help save lives.	0
ClaimBuster	17611				And I might add that uh - my administration - and I'm very proud of it - is the first administration that has taken an antitrust action against companies in this country that have allegedly cooperated with the Arab boycott.	1
ClaimBuster	17612				When it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	17613				I happen to think she's a key person.	0
ClaimBuster	17614				"And a recent book that just came out by perhaps the Nation's most respected author in this field, Strobe Talbott, called ""Deadly Gambits,'' concludes that this President has failed to master the essential details needed to command and lead us, both in terms of security and terms of arms control."	1
ClaimBuster	17615				If the majority of the members of the Congress felt that these particular proposals were good issues - the majority of those who were Democrats - why didn't they pass them and send to the President and get a veto and have an issue?	0
ClaimBuster	17616				So that is why I advocate a program of tax reform which will stimulate more investment in our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	17617				Absolutely, and I proposed over a hundred billion dollars in cuts in Federal spending over 4 years, but I am not going to cut it out of Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and things -- [applause] -- that people need.	1
ClaimBuster	17618				One of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family and for those children is the threat that they mat lose their health insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	17619				The reason Medicare and Medicaid are a mess is we froze them.	1
ClaimBuster	17620				I know the oil companies have been itching to do that, but it is not the right thing for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	17621				And third, credible: Ladies and gentlemen, in 1985, I was one of the first Democrats to move to balance the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	17622				The other thing is, we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth.	0
ClaimBuster	17623				So, I don't think vouchers are the right way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	17624				And I actually believe that we need missile defense, because of Iran and North Korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons, but I also believe that, when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation, then we're making a mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	17625				I don't think he would be listening to you very much anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	17626				You don't want to politicize drugs, but it's already politicized Medicare, go out and scare senior citizens and other vulnerable groups, veterans and people who get Pell Grants and things like this.	0
ClaimBuster	17627				It has to be helped, has to be fixed.	0
ClaimBuster	17628				Our country has been very active with regular conversations with the leaders there.	1
ClaimBuster	17629				Could be wrong, but I think so.	0
ClaimBuster	17630				Now let's pass the tax cuts for education and child rearing, help with medical emergencies, and buying a home.	0
ClaimBuster	17631				That's the net of what's happened in the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	17632				But there are two main focal points of this election.	0
ClaimBuster	17633				Now, the priorities are just very different.	0
ClaimBuster	17634				We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again.	0
ClaimBuster	17635				And it's not just looking to our words that you have to take in evidence of where they go.	0
ClaimBuster	17636				He said he was going to lower tax rates.	1
ClaimBuster	17637				I am talking of taking the treaty back, and going back into negotiations.	0
ClaimBuster	17638				Anybody who says that the inflation rate is in good shape now ought to talk to the housewives.	0
ClaimBuster	17639				He believes in deregulation in every circumstance.	1
ClaimBuster	17640				The fact is, the take-home pay of a typical American family as a share of national income is lower than it's been since 1929.	1
ClaimBuster	17641				Mr. President, let me finish.	0
ClaimBuster	17642				We took the Senate report, of course.	1
ClaimBuster	17643				If you're a company in St. Louis working, trying to make jobs here, there is actually an incentive for you to go away.	0
ClaimBuster	17644				I think it depends on what we do.	0
ClaimBuster	17645				And what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he's never apologized for.	1
ClaimBuster	17646				I have fought for Social Security and Medicare and for things to help people who are vulnerable all my life, and I will do it as President of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	17647				I hope they'll think it's good that democracy and freedom is on the move.	0
ClaimBuster	17648				We now have uh - a greatly expanded White House staff.	1
ClaimBuster	17649				What I would propose, and I proposed it way back in March when I was a candidate in my own state of Illinois, I proposed $11.3 billion, specifically, in cuts in the Federal budget.	1
ClaimBuster	17650				Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.	0
ClaimBuster	17651				There are different ideas -- the Bush plan, the Perot plan, the Clinton -- we have different ideas.	0
ClaimBuster	17652				But more importantly, let the people in our own country realize that we still live in the greatest nation on earth.	0
ClaimBuster	17653				I don't think we can wait until the next president is inaugurated and then uh - select a new team and then all the months of negotiating that will take place before we reach a decision, I think that immediately after this election we should set a timetable - the next president, working with the present President, President Eisenhower - a timetable to break the Soviet filibuster.	0
ClaimBuster	17654				This is about getting jobs for the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	17655				And I think we're all together on that.	0
ClaimBuster	17656				Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger.	0
ClaimBuster	17657				Saddam Hussein would have been continually weakening.	0
ClaimBuster	17658				The worst thing that I can think can happen in this campaign would be for it to be decided on religious issues.	0
ClaimBuster	17659				I think everybody understands at this point that we are experiencing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	17660				I don't think we agree on that.	0
ClaimBuster	17661				Before I decided to run, I had to resolve two issues in my mind.	0
ClaimBuster	17662				That's not the kind of advocacy that women need.	0
ClaimBuster	17663				My opponent just this weekend talked about how terrorism could be reduced to a nuisance, comparing it to prostitution, illegal gambling.	1
ClaimBuster	17664				And I can assure you that if I'm elected president we will do so.	0
ClaimBuster	17665				And what I'm about to say is unclassified.	0
ClaimBuster	17666				So we need to have fixed-cost contracts.	0
ClaimBuster	17667				I've been heavily criticized because I called for the resignation of the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.	1
ClaimBuster	17668				Is that the kind of leadership we need?	0
ClaimBuster	17669				Jim, let me tell you exactly what I'll do.	0
ClaimBuster	17670				Governor Romney, here's what we did.	0
ClaimBuster	17671				We're going to reform our intelligence services to make sure that we get the best intelligence possible.	0
ClaimBuster	17672				As a matter of fact in his book, The Strategy for Peace, he took the right position.	0
ClaimBuster	17673				The time for campaign funding reform is after the election.	0
ClaimBuster	17674				And from the a- analysis that I've made so far, it seems to me that that tax bill does uh - justify my signature and my approval.	0
ClaimBuster	17675				Social Security is stable until, as you pointed out, at least the third decade of the next century.	1
ClaimBuster	17676				I just -- I think that racial profiling is a serious problem.	0
ClaimBuster	17677				You have to make choices.	0
ClaimBuster	17678				They learn to think well or poorly of themselves in the first 18 months.	1
ClaimBuster	17679				But to the extent that we continue to use atomic power, I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained.	0
ClaimBuster	17680				We want a peaceful planet.	0
ClaimBuster	17681				And yet last year we gave them less than five percent of all the technical assistance funds that we distributed around the world.	1
ClaimBuster	17682				I don't think we want to get to how he's going to pay for all these promises.	0
ClaimBuster	17683				I know how to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	17684				But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas I'll just note.	0
ClaimBuster	17685				It's a tax cut, cutting capital gains 50 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	17686				We don't have an alternative.	0
ClaimBuster	17687				Making sure that we've got the best education system in the world, including retraining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow.	0
ClaimBuster	17688				No, I wouldn't do away with all - uh business deductions.	0
ClaimBuster	17689				But here's something that we can take great pride in because it really does get to what you're talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	17690				When I opposed Medicare, there was another piece of legislation meeting the same problem before the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	17691				He has no respect for her.	0
ClaimBuster	17692				That's exactly where the tax cuts went.	1
ClaimBuster	17693				By the way, my friends, I know you grow a little weary with this back-and-forth.	0
ClaimBuster	17694				Well, I must say, I look back at the vote on Medicare in 1965, we had a program called Eldercare that also provided drugs and means tests to people who needed medical attention received it.	1
ClaimBuster	17695				It's called make America great again.	0
ClaimBuster	17696				"Call me, let me know."""	0
ClaimBuster	17697				Well, Milosevic has lost the election.	1
ClaimBuster	17698				In addition to what you mentioned, they also were concerned about this all-powerful central government in Washington, D.C., that'd in effect confiscate your property, so -- I carry it in my pocket -- I can't pull it out or I'd violate the rules -- a copy of the Tenth Amendment which says we ought to return power to the states and the people, the people here.	0
ClaimBuster	17699				But the main thing is he still didn't get it, from what he said the other night to that fine woman on our program, the 209 people in Richmond.	0
ClaimBuster	17700				Because economic growth means strength and vitality; it means we're able to sustain our defenses; it means we're able to meet our commitments abroad.	0
ClaimBuster	17701				But I've always tried in whatever I've done is to bring people together.	0
ClaimBuster	17702				You've gone up, in Missouri, about $3,500.	1
ClaimBuster	17703				And, Senator McCain, he says -- he talks about Arizona.	1
ClaimBuster	17704				And you should go down and take a look at that.	0
ClaimBuster	17705				Margaret, I'm not sure I can get all of this in in one minute.	0
ClaimBuster	17706				I don't blame him, because in 1975 we had fewer housing starts in this country, fewer homes built, than any year since 1940.	1
ClaimBuster	17707				The fact is that he did not choose to go to war as a last result.	1
ClaimBuster	17708				I would ask for your vote, and I promise you that if you give me the extraordinary honor of serving as your president, I will work every single day, tirelessly, on your behalf and on the behalf of the future of our children.	0
ClaimBuster	17709				I think that we're out in front of most -- and I see that the red light is blinking, so I can't continue.	0
ClaimBuster	17710				One reason is, you know, the third biggest spending item in our budget is interest on the national debt?	1
ClaimBuster	17711				And Ross properly says, okay, there's some pain in that.	0
ClaimBuster	17712				Our policy was not to cut subsidies.	0
ClaimBuster	17713				She's given money back to the taxpayers.	1
ClaimBuster	17714				Let's look at the position.	0
ClaimBuster	17715				And, of course, Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon, we've got real (inaudible).	1
ClaimBuster	17716				Net farm income is off 50 percent in the last 3 years, and every farmer knows it.	1
ClaimBuster	17717				You'll be in a world in which fits into my philosophy.	0
ClaimBuster	17718				I'm interested in working with our nations and do a lot of it.	0
ClaimBuster	17719				I would be a president for all of the people, African- Americans, the inner cities.	0
ClaimBuster	17720				And Senator Obama, it's good to be with you at a town hall meeting.	0
ClaimBuster	17721				As I said at the beginning, the question before us all, that faces all Republicans and all Democrats, is: can freedom in the next generation conquer, or are the Communists going to be successful?	0
ClaimBuster	17722				The contracts need to be smaller, the agencies need to be -- need to recruit and to work hard to find people to bid on the state contracts.	0
ClaimBuster	17723				There are some advantages to experience, and knowledge, and judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	17724				I think -- in the last few years I think have been unfortunate.	0
ClaimBuster	17725				I make no bones about it.	0
ClaimBuster	17726				But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades.	0
ClaimBuster	17727				Now, just because we cannot be involved everywhere, and shouldn't be, doesn't mean that we should shy away from going in anywhere.	0
ClaimBuster	17728				And we just have to take it day-to-day right now.	0
ClaimBuster	17729				We want there to be electronic medical records to cut down on error, as well as reduce cost.	0
ClaimBuster	17730				I don't really think it's any of my -- you know, any of my concerns what -- how you conduct your sex life.	0
ClaimBuster	17731				Including the parents in the preschool education of their kids, even if they're poor and uneducated, can make a huge difference.	0
ClaimBuster	17732				I expect those new energy sources to be built right here in the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	17733				And we have this arms race underway.	0
ClaimBuster	17734				I talked about it earlier when I talked about the works and faith without works being dead.	1
ClaimBuster	17735				Through our Race to the Top program, we've worked with Republican and Democratic governors to initiate major reforms, and they're having an impact right now.	1
ClaimBuster	17736				I strongly support term limits for members of the US Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	17737				So that's why I hope that we will come together in this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	17738				I do not for a moment think I'm entitled to all the credit for all the good things that have happened in America.	0
ClaimBuster	17739				That's not what I have.	0
ClaimBuster	17740				He's a vice presidential nominee who represents -- I think people got to see why I picked him.	0
ClaimBuster	17741				... million new jobs, a balanced budget...	0
ClaimBuster	17742				This isn't going to blow a hole in the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	17743				The European Community is in a position to pay a lot more than they have in the past.	1
ClaimBuster	17744				When the Asian financial crisis raised the risk of world-wide recession that could affect our economy, And now, of course, the euro's value has been dropping, but seems to be under control.	1
ClaimBuster	17745				I'm going to be respectful for people who may disagree with me.	0
ClaimBuster	17746				But it is -- the basic structure is sound.	0
ClaimBuster	17747				Our plan will balance the budget, grow the economy, preserve the environment, and invest in education.	0
ClaimBuster	17748				If you don't have health insurance, then what we're going to do is to provide you the option of buying into the same kind of federal pool that both Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees, which will give you high-quality care, choice of doctors, at lower costs, because so many people are part of this insured group.	0
ClaimBuster	17749				So we're going to have to tell the American people that spending is going to have to be cut in America.	0
ClaimBuster	17750				I'm confident that it can be done and that it will reduce inflation because I did it in California.	1
ClaimBuster	17751				I have given every bit of evidence, answered every question that's as- been asked me by any senator or any member of the House.	1
ClaimBuster	17752				Thank you, Mr. President, for those kind words.	0
ClaimBuster	17753				And we can get those weapons at the same time as we get China.	0
ClaimBuster	17754				We can't coddle, as we did, a dictator, give him billions of dollars and then he's making peace treaties with the Taliban and militants.	1
ClaimBuster	17755				And if we fail, the cause of freedom fails.	0
ClaimBuster	17756				What's at issue here is the President's application of his authority to understand what a President must know to lead this nation, secure our defense, and make the decisions and the judgments that are necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	17757				But very specifically the key thing is to turn the government back to the people and take it away from the special interests and have people go to Washington to serve.	0
ClaimBuster	17758				That's why in this whole area of civil rights, the equality of opportunity for employment and education is not just for the benefit of the minority groups, it's for the benefit of the nation so that we can get the scientists and the engineers and all the rest that we need.	0
ClaimBuster	17759				Their oil production has plunged to the lowest level since they were fighting a war with Iraq 20 years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	17760				If you take a patient into the hospital that's bleeding arterially, step one is to stop the bleeding.	0
ClaimBuster	17761				More money is needed and I spend more money, but step one is to make sure we reform the system to have the system in place that leaves no child behind.	0
ClaimBuster	17762				My plan has not only a short-term component, but also a long-term component.	1
ClaimBuster	17763				I don't think we should give up on the private schools and leave kids trapped in failing schools.	0
ClaimBuster	17764				That's what we caught him doing.	1
ClaimBuster	17765				Not all this back and forth, you voted this way, you voted that way, we want a better America as we go into the next century.	0
ClaimBuster	17766				The Soviet Union in 1955 expressed regrets to us over the Bering Sea incident.	1
ClaimBuster	17767				My plan was to have the company go through bankruptcy like 7-Eleven did and Macy's and Condell (ph) Airlines and come out stronger.	1
ClaimBuster	17768				We are exporting more coal this year than any year in history.	1
ClaimBuster	17769				So I will keep on as president trying to get a successful conclusion to the GATT Round, the big Uruguay Round of trade which will really open up markets for our agriculture particularly.	0
ClaimBuster	17770				China and India were exempted from that treaty.	1
ClaimBuster	17771				We have to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't like us very much.	0
ClaimBuster	17772				That we must, in the failure to be able to protect our national security as it is today, we must not be provocative to any possible adversary.	0
ClaimBuster	17773				I will keep America strong and get America's middle class working again.	0
ClaimBuster	17774				I've done a lot of things that were controversial.	1
ClaimBuster	17775				We'll produce more coal this year than any year in history.	1
ClaimBuster	17776				That's what we need more of, and that's what I've done in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	17777				We lost a lot of manufacturing jobs in the 12 years before I became President.	1
ClaimBuster	17778				The position of the United States has been that this build-up, in the words of the president, has been foolish.	0
ClaimBuster	17779				He said that by now we'd have unemployment at 5.4 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	17780				We have to guard our energy companies.	0
ClaimBuster	17781				I don't think there's any doubt that, in the future, the cost of oil is going to go up.	0
ClaimBuster	17782				And a month or so ago I did uh - likewise say over the next ten years we should expand - double - this national parks, the wild wilderness areas, the scenic river areas.	1
ClaimBuster	17783				But the federal spending for education is up, and I want to be the education president, because I want to see us do better.	1
ClaimBuster	17784				Now, when you out-spend Congress you're really swinging.	0
ClaimBuster	17785				When I was in the senate before I became vice president I was pushing for stronger action against Milosevic.	1
ClaimBuster	17786				I have no loans from Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	17787				And I think it's the consensus of the people who are knowledgeable in the military field, that he is probably the outstanding military leader and strategist that we have in America today.	0
ClaimBuster	17788				But where I have moved to work with the American people to help them have the tools to make the most of their own lives, I think I should get some credit for that.	0
ClaimBuster	17789				We'll never have uh - an end to the inflationary spiral, and we'll never have a balanced budget until we get our people back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	17790				Up until about $70,000, as you go up the ladder, my proposals will be far more beneficial.	1
ClaimBuster	17791				Let's reform it and fund it.	0
ClaimBuster	17792				I think credibility is important.	0
ClaimBuster	17793				Now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	17794				Mr. Ford has uh - misquoted an AP uh - news story that was in error to begin with.	1
ClaimBuster	17795				And I think it's time that when you got a job in this country it came with health insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	17796				One reason family farmers are forced to sell early is because of the death tax.	1
ClaimBuster	17797				If we're moving ahead, if we're providing a viable economy, if our people have sufficient resources so that they can consume what we produce; then this country's on the move, then we're stronger, then we set a better example to the world.	0
ClaimBuster	17798				I want you to be able to choose the health care for you and your family.	0
ClaimBuster	17799				And we cut those three hundred - uh agencies and so forth down substantially.	1
ClaimBuster	17800				It is important, though, for us to use all the tools at our disposal to prevent the scenario where we've got to make those kinds of choices.	0
ClaimBuster	17801				If you put term limits in and don't reform government, you won't get the benefits you thought.	0
ClaimBuster	17802				At the present time we're at peace.	0
ClaimBuster	17803				They're watching what we do, what we say, what we promise and what we finally deliver.	0
ClaimBuster	17804				Capital gains, investment tax allowance, credit for first- time homebuyers.	0
ClaimBuster	17805				They don't name him the most liberal in the United States Senate because he hasn't shown up to many meetings.	1
ClaimBuster	17806				And we've reached out to young people and their families and been able to help them by beginning drug education and prevention in the early elementary grades.	1
ClaimBuster	17807				So we have the problem of not only building our own uh - military strength and extending uh - our policies abroad, we have to do a job here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	17808				And we're not talking about failure of institutions on Wall Street.	0
ClaimBuster	17809				I think we ought to attack our country's problems, not attack each other.	0
ClaimBuster	17810				And it is true that this is going to be, I think, one of the most consequential decisions of the next president.	0
ClaimBuster	17811				That's why we want an economic package.	0
ClaimBuster	17812				They have been our friend since their inception as a nation.	1
ClaimBuster	17813				Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here.	0
ClaimBuster	17814				We're going to grow some of these jobs in America, because we need to get it -- they're going the wrong way.	0
ClaimBuster	17815				But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.	0
ClaimBuster	17816				I'm also very tough on violent crime.	0
ClaimBuster	17817				Well, I don't know of any perfect solution.	0
ClaimBuster	17818				Who's the best person to get results and not talk?	0
ClaimBuster	17819				I think we have to make progress first in the field of employment.	0
ClaimBuster	17820				Look, Governor Romney's called for $5 trillion of tax cuts that he says he's going to pay for by closing deductions.	1
ClaimBuster	17821				I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us.	0
ClaimBuster	17822				And I will not stop in our efforts to hunt down and kill the terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	17823				Well, the other day, Vice President Bush disclosed his tax returns to the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	17824				Yes, I'd be glad to.	0
ClaimBuster	17825				But all of my proposals are focused on that problem, gun safety.	1
ClaimBuster	17826				That's why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars.	1
ClaimBuster	17827				So it seems to me that we can talk about what we call Kenny, the great exaggerator.	0
ClaimBuster	17828				I think it's time America started moving again.	0
ClaimBuster	17829				One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet.	0
ClaimBuster	17830				But I got a better plan.	0
ClaimBuster	17831				And that was now all on tape, started by her.	1
ClaimBuster	17832				Which means, of course, that uh - we will have to maintain an adequate military capability - which means, of course, that we will have to add a uh - I think uh - a few billion dollars to our defense appropriations to make certain that we have adequate uh -strategic forces - adequate conventional forces.	0
ClaimBuster	17833				Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work...	0
ClaimBuster	17834				We'd better wait and see what the results are.	0
ClaimBuster	17835				He's broken it three times in the past year already.	1
ClaimBuster	17836				But for me to try, in this very pluralistic society of ours, to try to frame any definition, whatever, of what that belief should be, is wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	17837				He talked about children whose parents don't speak English as a first language?	1
ClaimBuster	17838				They are now operating in 60 countries.	1
ClaimBuster	17839				And we'll get our economy going again.	0
ClaimBuster	17840				I've made that clear throughout my presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	17841				The use of cocaine, for example, by teenagers is dramatically down.	1
ClaimBuster	17842				But that doesn't cost any more as far as the federal treasury is concerned.	1
ClaimBuster	17843				This really underscores the problem with the American health-care system.	0
ClaimBuster	17844				And one of the things I want to do is make sure that we're providing incentives so that you can buy a fuel efficient car that's made right here in the United States of America, not in Japan or South Korea, making sure that you are able to weatherize your home or make your business more fuel efficient.	0
ClaimBuster	17845				Governor Carter has embraced the record of the present Congress, dominated by his political party.	1
ClaimBuster	17846				Now here is the difference.	0
ClaimBuster	17847				It is now running at 12.7%.	1
ClaimBuster	17848				And spending restraint has got to be a vital part of that.	0
ClaimBuster	17849				And therefore, he said, many of these countries now feel that the Soviet Union, which was once so backward, is now on a par with the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	17850				We had a 1.2 million bankruptcy, set a new record.	1
ClaimBuster	17851				We can correct our difficult mistakes and answer those very tough questions.	0
ClaimBuster	17852				The test is, are you doing everything possible to make America safe?	0
ClaimBuster	17853				Tomorrow, Afghanistan will be voting for a president.	1
ClaimBuster	17854				All I'm saying is if you spend money, show us results and test every year, which you do not do, Mr. Vice President.	1
ClaimBuster	17855				I recognize we can't do it now, nor do I advocate an immediate withdrawal.	0
ClaimBuster	17856				We've got to deal with things like racial profiling.	0
ClaimBuster	17857				No, I think the debate ought to be between you and Lloyd.	0
ClaimBuster	17858				Making life so miserable on folks that they'll leave.	0
ClaimBuster	17859				Now the Senator referred to the Committee on Government Contracts.	1
ClaimBuster	17860				It wasn't just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	17861				It's hurt the housing market because Dodd-Frank didn't anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have.	1
ClaimBuster	17862				I'm only reducing the amount of the increase.	0
ClaimBuster	17863				And I don't think that's just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	17864				But it doesn't take just a quiet uh - dormant uh minimum enforcement of the law.	0
ClaimBuster	17865				She's made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	17866				Soros, who's a friend of hers, took a massive deduction.	1
ClaimBuster	17867				Don't forget what he tried to do with health care.	0
ClaimBuster	17868				I suggest now that our number one preoccupation is red ink and our country and we've got to put our people back to work so that we can afford to do these things we want to do in Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	17869				Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country.	0
ClaimBuster	17870				We cut taxes for 15 million working Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	17871				And some would say maybe me more so than others.	0
ClaimBuster	17872				And that's an image of strength -- except that if he had had his way when the Nimitz was being planned, he would have been deep in the water out there because there wouldn't have been any Nimitz to stand on -- he was against it.	1
ClaimBuster	17873				And they get health care.	1
ClaimBuster	17874				I believe Washington ought to set standards, but again I think we ought to be collaborative at the local levels and I think we ought to work with people at the local levels.	0
ClaimBuster	17875				I think what we need to do is convince people who live in the lands they live in to build the nations.	0
ClaimBuster	17876				That's the wrong way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	17877				Yes, this had to do with our disarmament talks.	0
ClaimBuster	17878				They're still number one today.	1
ClaimBuster	17879				We helped stabilize the situation with some troops, and when the African Union came, we moved them out.	1
ClaimBuster	17880				We'd put money into the hands of people who work hard, who obey the rules, who play for the American dream.	0
ClaimBuster	17881				You can make a lot of money and pay lower tax rates than somebody who makes a lot less.	1
ClaimBuster	17882				Chris Reeve is a friend of mine.	1
ClaimBuster	17883				Whether it be bringing climate change to the floor of the Senate for the first time.	0
ClaimBuster	17884				He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.	1
ClaimBuster	17885				The HMO, the insurance company, can't gag that doctor from giving you full advice.	1
ClaimBuster	17886				Nobody has more respect for women than I do.	0
ClaimBuster	17887				On pay for teachers, on all these categories, Arkansas is right near the very bottom.	1
ClaimBuster	17888				Now I've come out with a new agenda for America's renewal, a plan that I believe really will help stimulate the growth of this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	17889				The second thing that we can do is provide a fair trade playing field.	0
ClaimBuster	17890				It made a lot of sense.	0
ClaimBuster	17891				The president has term limits.	1
ClaimBuster	17892				I do not believe that we, the United States, should sell, give or otherwise transfer military hardware to the People's Republic of China, or any other Communist nation, such as the Soviet Union and the like.	0
ClaimBuster	17893				And once they feel secure, then they lead normal, social, economic, political lives, the same thing that's happening in Iraq today.	1
ClaimBuster	17894				Capitalism is growing and thriving across big portions of China.	1
ClaimBuster	17895				America is the greatest place on the face of the earth.	0
ClaimBuster	17896				Whichever place you put it.	0
ClaimBuster	17897				I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through.	0
ClaimBuster	17898				Iraq was not even close to the center of the war on terror before the president invaded it.	1
ClaimBuster	17899				So it's one of my top priorities.	0
ClaimBuster	17900				We cannot protect countries all over the world...	0
ClaimBuster	17901				It wasn't until election year, Mr. President, that you ever thought about stopping smoking.	1
ClaimBuster	17902				That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record.	0
ClaimBuster	17903				Americans are hurting right now, and they're angry.	0
ClaimBuster	17904				But I don't think we can be satisfied when we're spending $150 billion a year in interest alone on the national debt, much of it going to foreign bankers; or when 25 percent of our high school students are dropping out of school; or when we have 2-1/2 million of our fellow citizens, a third of them veterans, who are homeless and living on streets and in doorways in this country, when Mr. Bush's prescription for our economic future is another tax giveaway to the rich.	1
ClaimBuster	17905				But you're absolutely correct, it is a threat, it's a huge threat.	0
ClaimBuster	17906				And I think that it's going to take some time to work itself out.	0
ClaimBuster	17907				These make-work, temporary jobs - dead end as they are - are not the kind of jobs that we want for our people.	0
ClaimBuster	17908				And I've fought to simplify it, and I have proposals to simplify it.	1
ClaimBuster	17909				I want the future, and I think we have to grab it.	0
ClaimBuster	17910				The end of the Cold War brings an incredible opportunity for change.	0
ClaimBuster	17911				I own a timber company?	0
ClaimBuster	17912				If we had not taken our initiative, it's very, very possible that uh - the government of Rhodesia would have been overrun and that the Soviet Union and the Cubans would have dominated uh - southern Africa.	0
ClaimBuster	17913				And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state.	0
ClaimBuster	17914				I am concerned about ethnic cleansing.	0
ClaimBuster	17915				"Say, ""I made a terrible mistake."""	0
ClaimBuster	17916				I would have, first of all, across-the-board spending freeze, OK?	0
ClaimBuster	17917				And as a consequence, there's no doubt that attitudes about Americans have changed.	0
ClaimBuster	17918				I think the government's spending too much.	0
ClaimBuster	17919				If every family in America signed up, like the senator suggested, if would cost us $5 trillion over 10 years.	1
ClaimBuster	17920				She's got tremendous -- she's got tremendous hatred.	0
ClaimBuster	17921				And I think the biggest dividend of making these tough calls is the fact that we are less afraid of nuclear war.	0
ClaimBuster	17922				No one can be opposed to alternate energy.	0
ClaimBuster	17923				And it shouldn't be allowed to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	17924				I believe in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	17925				It hurts the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	17926				And of course, we're talking about positive plan of action to restore this economy and restore jobs in America.	0
ClaimBuster	17927				It added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned.	1
ClaimBuster	17928				We've been challenged, and we've risen to those challenges.	0
ClaimBuster	17929				We are quarantining Mr. Castro today.	1
ClaimBuster	17930				And if India should lose her battle, with thirty-five per cent of the people of the underdeveloped world within her borders, then I believe that the balance of power could move against us.	1
ClaimBuster	17931				Tell Aleksander Kwasniewski of Poland we're going alone.	0
ClaimBuster	17932				The Shah had done our bidding and carried our load in the Middle East for quite some time, and I did think that it was a blot on our record that we let him down.	1
ClaimBuster	17933				And, Jim, I -- I've been not feeling too great about a lot of things lately.	0
ClaimBuster	17934				The Braves, one; the Cardinals, nothing, early on.	1
ClaimBuster	17935				And that's probably a promise that Governor Romney thinks I've kept.	0
ClaimBuster	17936				Well, the economy is still growing slow.	1
ClaimBuster	17937				It's time for a chief executive who can make tough choices, can work with the Congress, can get that deficit down and begin to build a strong fiscal foundation under this country.	0
ClaimBuster	17938				He would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	17939				I'm against the grain embargo; it was a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	17940				I'd like to say you can also take a little time off without losing your job to go to a regular parent-teacher conference or to go to a regular doctor's appointment with a family member.	0
ClaimBuster	17941				And we were stymied until the families of 9/11 came, and they descended on Washington, and we got that legislation passed.	1
ClaimBuster	17942				There were several off-the-subject quaffers in that litany.	1
ClaimBuster	17943				We can work with the entertainment industry to provide family hour.	0
ClaimBuster	17944				I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do.	0
ClaimBuster	17945				I just think that we ought to support the decision.	0
ClaimBuster	17946				I have said again and again, and this really upsets the establishment in Washington, that we're going to inform the people in detail on the issues through an electronic town hall so that they really know what's going on.	1
ClaimBuster	17947				Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that.	0
ClaimBuster	17948				You don't know who broke in to DNC.	0
ClaimBuster	17949				We're not -- we're not -- we're not rifle shots here.	0
ClaimBuster	17950				That's what the election's about.	0
ClaimBuster	17951				You know, four years ago, we were going through a major crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	17952				But there's a difference in terms of how we would do it.	0
ClaimBuster	17953				That shows that there's been more growth in this Administration than in its predecessor.	1
ClaimBuster	17954				If he's trying to allege that I'm a hard-hearted person and I don't care about children, he's absolutely wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	17955				And the unique threat was that he could give weapons of mass destruction to an organization like Al Qaida, and the harm they inflicted on us with airplanes would be multiplied greatly by weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	17956				Take a look at it.	0
ClaimBuster	17957				In other words, a President has to make choices.	0
ClaimBuster	17958				Senator Obama will tell you, in the -- as the extreme environmentalists do, it has to be safe.	0
ClaimBuster	17959				This is a government that is not serving you.	0
ClaimBuster	17960				And I think that we have to do it as quickly as possible, because it's been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse, not better.	1
ClaimBuster	17961				And I did as secretary of state.	1
ClaimBuster	17962				The President says it'll disappear automatically.	0
ClaimBuster	17963				Recently Ian Smith, the uh - president of uh - Rhodesia, announced that he had unequivocal commitments from Mr. Kissinger that he could not reveal.	1
ClaimBuster	17964				She's been doing it a long time.	0
ClaimBuster	17965				And so I say that we believe that our policies of military strength, of economic strength, of diplomatic firmness first will keep the peace and keep it without surrender.	0
ClaimBuster	17966				We're going to have a lot of free trade.	0
ClaimBuster	17967				And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	17968				If you got the Government down to the lowest level, that you yourself could say it could not go any lower and still perform the services for the people, and if the recovery was so complete that you knew you were getting the ultimate amount of revenues that you could get through that growth, and there was still some slight difference there between those two lines, then I had said once that, yes, you would have to then look to see if taxes should not be adjusted.	0
ClaimBuster	17969				Karl Marx said that the free enterprise system in a democracy can only continue to exist when they are at war or preparing far war.	1
ClaimBuster	17970				I don't want to embarrass our oldest daughter.	0
ClaimBuster	17971				I'm going to be able to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	17972				Obviously, no President wants war, and I certainly do not believe that Governor Reagan, if he were President, would want war, but a President in the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace, through diplomacy, or in a careless way in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past.	0
ClaimBuster	17973				Cracking down on China when they cheat.	0
ClaimBuster	17974				And, as a matter of fact, it just so happens that in the quirks of administering these taxes, those above $50,000 actually did not get quite as big a tax cut percentage-wise as did those from 50,000 down.	1
ClaimBuster	17975				We have to be able to sell abroad more than we consume uh - from abroad if we're going to be able to meet our obligations.	0
ClaimBuster	17976				And we have fought back for four years to get out of that mess.	1
ClaimBuster	17977				So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country.	0
ClaimBuster	17978				I believe we can and we ought to.	0
ClaimBuster	17979				And my case to the American people is, if you're happy with inactivity, stay with the horse.	0
ClaimBuster	17980				He's made these claims repeatedly.	1
ClaimBuster	17981				And that's why he wants to veto it, just like he vetoed an earlier bill this year.	1
ClaimBuster	17982				And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors.	1
ClaimBuster	17983				But I would ask the American people to understand that if we make imprudent cuts, if we go too far, we risk the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	17984				-- -- and the people of the Soviet Union want it to stop.	0
ClaimBuster	17985				New business formation is down to the lowest level in 30 years under this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	17986				It's long overdue time to raise the minimum wage.	0
ClaimBuster	17987				You know, it's not a bank account that just pays back money that's invested.	0
ClaimBuster	17988				We have now uh - for instance only 7 percent of the total education cost being financed by the federal government.	1
ClaimBuster	17989				Secondly, we've got to invest in economic growth in this country, in every part of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	17990				So we've talked about our responsibility tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	17991				I have been a hunter all my life and happen to own both shotguns, rifles, and a handgun.	1
ClaimBuster	17992				And this is where there's a difference, because Governor Romney's central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut -- on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts -- that's another trillion dollars -- and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn't asked for.	1
ClaimBuster	17993				He lost the Wisconsin primary.	1
ClaimBuster	17994				I could do a better job.	0
ClaimBuster	17995				And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary?	0
ClaimBuster	17996				In the last four years, you cut permits and licenses on federal land and federal waters in half.	1
ClaimBuster	17997				They asked for the tanks.	1
ClaimBuster	17998				So my attitude is, we've got to grow the economy from the bottom up.	0
ClaimBuster	17999				They did it on the Medicaid prescription drug bill and we have to change the culture.	1
ClaimBuster	18000				He's shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico.	1
ClaimBuster	18001				And in the secrecy that has surrounded our foreign policy in the last few years, uh - the American people, the Congress have been excluded.	0
ClaimBuster	18002				I believe that limited approach to the - to the question would be uh - advisable, and - and I think, adequate.	0
ClaimBuster	18003				The kind of tests which you can't detect are underground or in - in uh - perhaps in outer space.	0
ClaimBuster	18004				We're selling everything from from -- from telephones to CDs to rice in Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	18005				Congress has gotten kind of institutionalized.	0
ClaimBuster	18006				"In 1955, Mr. Dulles at a press conference said: ""The treaty that we have with the Republic of China excludes Quemoy and Matsu from the treaty area."""	1
ClaimBuster	18007				We're getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	18008				It seems to me that we ought to support the California civil rights initiative.	0
ClaimBuster	18009				In fact, we had a conversation about our mothers one day, a very poignant conversation in the White House.	1
ClaimBuster	18010				We've gotta get this country growing again and this economy strong again or we can't bring down the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	18011				The deficit was bigger than I thought it was going to be.	0
ClaimBuster	18012				We are playing the leadership role.	0
ClaimBuster	18013				And let me give you an example of what I mean.	0
ClaimBuster	18014				The world√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s coming together, as I said, they're looking to us.	0
ClaimBuster	18015				Basically it means they can't learn.	0
ClaimBuster	18016				And according to Investors Daily, which I read just a couple of days ago, 88 percent of the people he claims credit for are already covered in collective bargaining agreements or other agreements.	1
ClaimBuster	18017				I have fully funded the land and water conservation program; in fact, have recommended and the Congress approved a substantially increased land and water conservation program.	1
ClaimBuster	18018				I hope I will do a good job as one who has had a relatively clean record with no conflicts of interest in his own public life, as has the Governor, to exhort young people to get into public service.	0
ClaimBuster	18019				Now, we're going to have to make sure that as we trade with other nations that they play by the rules.	0
ClaimBuster	18020				It needs to be available for emergency situations.	0
ClaimBuster	18021				We were not promoting democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	18022				But there has never been a nation in the history of the world that saw its economy decline and maintained its military superiority.	1
ClaimBuster	18023				And I'll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot.	1
ClaimBuster	18024				If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be.	1
ClaimBuster	18025				It's time for a new path.	0
ClaimBuster	18026				Now, I think we can do ethically guided embryonic stem-cell research.	0
ClaimBuster	18027				Now, not only oil and natural gas, which we've been investing in; but also, we've got to make sure we're building the energy source of the future, not just thinking about next year, but ten years from now, 20 years from now.	0
ClaimBuster	18028				We have 11 million undocumented people.	1
ClaimBuster	18029				"But I'm going to violate that rule and say ""never.''"	0
ClaimBuster	18030				And this used to be a bipartisan issue.	1
ClaimBuster	18031				That is the closest I have ever come to anything voluntary with Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	18032				And although we've heard a lot about Wall Street, those of you on Main Street I think have been struggling for a while, and you recognize that this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	18033				Now, the fact is you're going to have a hard time convincing folks that we were a whole lot better off eight years ago than we are today.	0
ClaimBuster	18034				And over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the -- the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to -- wants to follow.	0
ClaimBuster	18035				Don't forget, what's key to bringing back jobs here is not just finding someone else to punish, and I'm going to be strict with people who we trade with to make sure they -- they follow the law and play by the rules, but it's also to make America the most attractive place in the world for businesses of all kinds.	1
ClaimBuster	18036				What is fair is everybody who pays taxes ought to get relief.	0
ClaimBuster	18037				You may think the biggest employer in America is General Motors, but I've got news for you.	0
ClaimBuster	18038				But this country is not coming apart at the seams, for heaven's sakes.	0
ClaimBuster	18039				And the way to do that is to increase our exports.	0
ClaimBuster	18040				That is, I want to bring down rates.	0
ClaimBuster	18041				I don't check it that often.	1
ClaimBuster	18042				This president is the first president ever, I think, not to meet with the NAACP.	1
ClaimBuster	18043				First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	18044				And with this new Congress coming in, gridlock will be gone, and I'll sit down with them and say let's get this done.	0
ClaimBuster	18045				And that's why they were supportive of the approach that we took.	0
ClaimBuster	18046				One is to control nuclear weapons, which I hope we'll get to later on because that is the most important single issue in this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	18047				It'll be a vital issue in my second term.	0
ClaimBuster	18048				And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.	0
ClaimBuster	18049				So there are many, many heroes in this country today.	0
ClaimBuster	18050				We wanted to tie it to Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	18051				I'm absolutely opposed to a national health care plan.	0
ClaimBuster	18052				My average in two years is twenty-six.	1
ClaimBuster	18053				Now, let me just give you an example.	0
ClaimBuster	18054				And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	18055				But the rest of the public's going to be paying for it.	0
ClaimBuster	18056				We talk a lot about these things, but you look at the -- the record, you look at the record.	0
ClaimBuster	18057				But the most important thing is my plan for the 21st Century is a better plan.	0
ClaimBuster	18058				And he can insult General Scowcroft if he wants to.	0
ClaimBuster	18059				As a matter of fact, there's been a moratorium on testing as a result of the fact that we have been negotiating.	1
ClaimBuster	18060				You go to the heart of America's worries tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	18061				A whole bunch of folks in America are concerned about the way the Patriot Act has been applied.	0
ClaimBuster	18062				Another point I wanna make is this.	0
ClaimBuster	18063				So any -- any language to the contrary is simply not accurate.	0
ClaimBuster	18064				No, education is how to help the person who's lost a job.	0
ClaimBuster	18065				Several government departments -- several -- had information that he was converting our aid to military purposes and trying to develop weapons of mass destruction.	1
ClaimBuster	18066				But, Governor, when you were in Massachusetts, small businesses development ranked about 48th, I think out of 50 states in Massachusetts, because the policies that you are promoting actually don't help small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	18067				But I don't think it's fair to say, you haven't had cancer.	0
ClaimBuster	18068				I supported us going into Bosnia, when a number of my own party and colleagues was against that operation in Bosnia.	1
ClaimBuster	18069				And that for them is a catastrophically low number.	1
ClaimBuster	18070				But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently.	0
ClaimBuster	18071				Look, it's just not true.	0
ClaimBuster	18072				The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make.	0
ClaimBuster	18073				We have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001.	1
ClaimBuster	18074				I told you I'd cut taxes for small businesses, and I have.	1
ClaimBuster	18075				He voted against student loans; he voted against my improved student loan plan; he voted against the National Service bill, against the HeadStart bill; he voted against our efforts in safe and drug-free schools.	1
ClaimBuster	18076				You won't slow defense spending; you refuse to do that -- --	0
ClaimBuster	18077				So you can go out and create more jobs and more opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	18078				It is the number one culprit.	0
ClaimBuster	18079				And most of the law enforcement agencies in America wanted that assault weapons ban.	1
ClaimBuster	18080				And they're either going to be destroyed or left frozen.	0
ClaimBuster	18081				I have worked with Latinos -- one of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote.	1
ClaimBuster	18082				I think they're asking for new and creative ways to try to reach it with everyone involved.	0
ClaimBuster	18083				But I think that one area we agree on is the important of parents and the importance of schools, because I do believe that if our young people have opportunity, then they are less likely to engage in these kinds of violent acts.	0
ClaimBuster	18084				Donald doesn't agree with that.	1
ClaimBuster	18085				We need to get rid of that provision because it's killing regional and small banks.	0
ClaimBuster	18086				But there was a period there when Poland demonstrated a national independence and even the Polish government moved some differn- di- distance away from the Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	18087				Governor Romney, that's not what you said...	1
ClaimBuster	18088				The man is practicing fuzzy math again.	0
ClaimBuster	18089				I know they're popular, but I'm against them.	0
ClaimBuster	18090				Almost all of our citizens came here from other lands and now have hopes, which are being realized, for a better life, preserving their ethnic commitments, their family structures, their religious beliefs, preserving their relationships with their relatives in foreign countries, but still holding themselves together in a very coherent society, which gives our nation its strength.	1
ClaimBuster	18091				Secondly, in Haiti, political violence is much, much smaller than it was.	1
ClaimBuster	18092				Well, one thing I'd do is get rid of carried interest.	0
ClaimBuster	18093				To combat unemployment we first must concentrate on the very areas to which you refer - the so-called depressed areas.	0
ClaimBuster	18094				And the only gratifying thing is, I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money...	0
ClaimBuster	18095				It says we need to do better in terms of stimulating private business.	0
ClaimBuster	18096				It's not just a threat -- threat to the state of Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	18097				And I think that you pointed the way in your comments, because when you say there are multiple things accomplished by farmers, you're specifically including conservation and protection of the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	18098				I do want to just point out that autism, for example, or other special needs will require some additional funding, if we're going to get serious in terms of research.	0
ClaimBuster	18099				We did, 25 percent across the board.	1
ClaimBuster	18100				Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land.	1
ClaimBuster	18101				Which I think the American people would like to understand fully, it's been investigated to a degree, but -- but the administration has carried out executive privilege to prevent all of the information from coming out.	1
ClaimBuster	18102				Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street.	0
ClaimBuster	18103				And I agree, it works extremely well now.	0
ClaimBuster	18104				It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge.	1
ClaimBuster	18105				How you can cut school lunches, how you can cut student assistance, how you can cut housing, how you can cut disability benefits, how you can do all of these things and then the people receiving them -- for example, the disabled, who have no alternative -- how they're going to do better, I don't know.	0
ClaimBuster	18106				It is not a government takeover.	0
ClaimBuster	18107				I stand with the Secretary of State, Mr. Herter, who said these islands were indefensible.	1
ClaimBuster	18108				I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be able to own a gun.	0
ClaimBuster	18109				I don't agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that.	0
ClaimBuster	18110				He noted a few, but there are others.	0
ClaimBuster	18111				They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories.	1
ClaimBuster	18112				"General Ridgway said - who was Chief of Staff: ""To go to war for Quemoy and Matsu to me would seem an unwarranted and tragic course to take."	1
ClaimBuster	18113				And it was the House Republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem.	1
ClaimBuster	18114				And what we've done during the Bush administration, the Kurds were at the State Department, negotiating, trying to work their differences out.	1
ClaimBuster	18115				I was hopeful diplomacy would work in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	18116				With respect to North Korea, the real story: We had inspectors and television cameras in the nuclear reactor in North Korea.	1
ClaimBuster	18117				The approach that Governor Romney's talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	18118				More than ever, we need to be united as a country.	0
ClaimBuster	18119				In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	18120				It's one of the reasons I'm a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts.	0
ClaimBuster	18121				But I also dropped the bottom rate from 15% to 10%.	1
ClaimBuster	18122				... talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities.	1
ClaimBuster	18123				You decided to stay home, and that's OK.	0
ClaimBuster	18124				We ought to do the same with Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	18125				I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s.	0
ClaimBuster	18126				Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don't know the reasons.	1
ClaimBuster	18127				which his own running mate, George Bush, described as voodoo economics, and said that it would result in a 30% inflation rate.	1
ClaimBuster	18128				Libya's 6 million population; Egypt, 80 million population.	1
ClaimBuster	18129				He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.	1
ClaimBuster	18130				But we're also a nation of laws.	1
ClaimBuster	18131				most people, when they think about cutting Government spending, they think in terms of eliminating necessary programs or wiping out something, some service that Government is supposed to perform.	0
ClaimBuster	18132				I have watched these people -- the same for our local law enforcement people.	0
ClaimBuster	18133				We've going to make sure that you've got to have a living will so -- so we can know how you're going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don't have other taxpayer bailouts.	0
ClaimBuster	18134				I see it as a serious problem.	0
ClaimBuster	18135				When he selected his vice presidential running mate, he selected a man who had voted against most of these proposals and who opposes them at the present time.	1
ClaimBuster	18136				That adds up to 44 million people.	1
ClaimBuster	18137				I would also consider arming the Kurds.	0
ClaimBuster	18138				But where I differ with my opponent is I am not going to make unilateral cuts in our strategic defend systems or support some freeze when they have superiority.	0
ClaimBuster	18139				(Applause) And so I'm still a little unclear as to whether he's for or against the tax increase.	0
ClaimBuster	18140				In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE.	1
ClaimBuster	18141				I was asked a technical question.	1
ClaimBuster	18142				There are tasks that government legitimately should enforce and tasks that government performs well, and you've named some of them.	1
ClaimBuster	18143				We should have physical fitness programs and nutrition programs in schools.	0
ClaimBuster	18144				Mr. Ford's own uh - environmental agency has projected a 10 percent unemployment rate by 1978 if he's uh - president.	1
ClaimBuster	18145				The president blocked you from the right to have less expensive drugs from Canada.	1
ClaimBuster	18146				You don't get any gun.	0
ClaimBuster	18147				And then, just as Castro had done in Cuba, the Sandinistas ousted the other parties to the revolution.	1
ClaimBuster	18148				Now Senator Kennedy has referred to the vote on Communist China.	1
ClaimBuster	18149				I was 19 or 20 flying off an aircraft carrier and that shaped me to be Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces.	1
ClaimBuster	18150				We heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	18151				Mr. President, it's good to be with you again this evening, sir.	0
ClaimBuster	18152				But we must all decide first we have the courage to change for hope and a better tomorrow.	0
ClaimBuster	18153				I believe in the President's commission on outdoors.	0
ClaimBuster	18154				He said here were all these intellectuals out there griping and complaining and saying it was negative coverage.	0
ClaimBuster	18155				I remember going on an airplane in Bangor, Maine, to say thanks to the reservists and Guard that were headed overseas from Tennessee and North Carolina, Georgia.	1
ClaimBuster	18156				Look, I've been in business for 25 years.	1
ClaimBuster	18157				Today, 47 million people on food stamps.	1
ClaimBuster	18158				The answer to that obviously was no, and as the result, I was elected to this office and promised a new beginning.	1
ClaimBuster	18159				I want to give a tax credit for the purchase of individual health insurance plans.	0
ClaimBuster	18160				But I'll always remember that the best weapons are the ones that are never fired in combat, and the best soldier is one who never has to lay his life down on the field of battle.	0
ClaimBuster	18161				As a matter of fact, the population explosion, if you look at the actual figures, has been vastly exaggerated -- over exaggerated.	1
ClaimBuster	18162				I wish he could have been with me when I sat with a group of teenagers who were black, and who were telling me about their unemployment problems, and that it was the minimum wage that had done away with the jobs that they once could get.	1
ClaimBuster	18163				Then the President sent a mission, composed of Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek in the spring of fifty-five to withdraw from the two islands, because they were exposed.	1
ClaimBuster	18164				You know he came to the Senate and never once proposed legislation to do that?	1
ClaimBuster	18165				I would say further that to blame the President in his veto power for the inability of the Senator and his colleagues to get action in this special session uh - misses the mark.	0
ClaimBuster	18166				Now, with respect to Fannie Mae, what Senator McCain didn't mention is the fact that this bill that he talked about wasn't his own bill.	1
ClaimBuster	18167				And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for, but also being willing to say no to some things.	0
ClaimBuster	18168				He voted against the first Gulf War.	1
ClaimBuster	18169				And I have enormous difference with the ACLU on their politic agenda.	0
ClaimBuster	18170				I'm not for command and control techniques either.	1
ClaimBuster	18171				The fact of the matter is if the Pledge of Allegiance was the acid test of one's patriotism--the vice president's been the presiding officer in the United States Senate for the past seven and a half years.	0
ClaimBuster	18172				I am concerned about the fact that 10 percent of our manufacturing and 20 percent of our banking and nearly half of the real estate in the city of Los Angeles are in the hands of foreign investors.	1
ClaimBuster	18173				Now we've increased that amount 25 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	18174				Governor Reagan is making some very misleading and disturbing statements.	0
ClaimBuster	18175				I believe that when you know something's going wrong, you make it right.	0
ClaimBuster	18176				I'm a year ahead of schedule.	1
ClaimBuster	18177				We have not seen the progress we need to have, and I'm convinced that with strong leadership and an effort to build a strategy based upon helping these nations reject extremism, we can see the kind of peace and prosperity the world demands.	0
ClaimBuster	18178				But let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	18179				It is something one would only - only consider if all of the other avenues had been -- had been tried to their full extent.	0
ClaimBuster	18180				It's pollution, carbon dioxide, and other chemicals that are even more potent, but in smaller quantities, that cause this.	1
ClaimBuster	18181				And you're right, I haven't vetoed any spending bills, because we work together.	1
ClaimBuster	18182				Oh, I'm it's my question.	0
ClaimBuster	18183				Cocaine use up 160 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	18184				Well, Mr. Ford, unfortunately, has just made a statement that's not true.	1
ClaimBuster	18185				A targeted tax cut, a real commitment to educational reform.	0
ClaimBuster	18186				This has been such an incredible education for me, Chris.	0
ClaimBuster	18187				That is why I think the Senate was right, including a majority of the Democrats, a majority of the Republicans, when they rejected Senator Kennedy's position in 1955.	1
ClaimBuster	18188				But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high.	1
ClaimBuster	18189				In my opinion, the government is not effective in -- in bringing down the cost of almost anything.	0
ClaimBuster	18190				In the Georgia government we only had one agency responsible for drug treatment.	1
ClaimBuster	18191				In the final analysis, I'm doing this for your children when you look at them tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	18192				He - we have a big difference on issues.	0
ClaimBuster	18193				We're going to have a lot of work to do, so I can't guarantee that we're going to do it in the next two years, but I'd like to do in the my first term as president.	0
ClaimBuster	18194				And as I just said that I believe that the passage of the so-called Title Three, which gives the Attorney General the power to protect Constitutional rights in those cases where it's not possible for the person involved to bring the suit.	1
ClaimBuster	18195				But they didn't have much of a partner in government here as compared with the policies the Germans and the Japanese followed, and I believe we can do better.	0
ClaimBuster	18196				But I must stop short of using American force until I know how those young men and women are going to get out of there as well as get in, know what the mission is, and define it.	0
ClaimBuster	18197				I don't think the National Rifle Association ran that ad.	0
ClaimBuster	18198				Somewhere in between those numbers -- and so there's a difference, what he's promised and what he can raise.	1
ClaimBuster	18199				Mr. Khrushchev is in New York, and he maintains the Communist offensive throughout the world because of the productive power of the Soviet Union itself.	1
ClaimBuster	18200				That's not how America was built.	0
ClaimBuster	18201				Young people are looking to us.	0
ClaimBuster	18202				And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way.	0
ClaimBuster	18203				And that terrible circumstance in this country is exported overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	18204				And there's a lot of fear -- in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect.	1
ClaimBuster	18205				Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things.	1
ClaimBuster	18206				That's not going to work.	0
ClaimBuster	18207				That's not a way to invite people.	0
ClaimBuster	18208				Number one, beef up our security and procedures, not just in Libya, but at every embassy and consulate in the region.	0
ClaimBuster	18209				He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote the other way, but we lost by one vote.	1
ClaimBuster	18210				And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil.	1
ClaimBuster	18211				And fortunately the rainy season will be ending shortly, which will make it easier to get aid there and help the long-suffering people there.	1
ClaimBuster	18212				And I think it's her campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	18213				If we keep somebody -- you know, illegally using a gun, there needs to be a consequence.	0
ClaimBuster	18214				Mr. McGee, we have a contractual right to be in Berlin coming out of the conversations at Potsdam and of World War II.	1
ClaimBuster	18215				And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive.	1
ClaimBuster	18216				We've got to make things here.	0
ClaimBuster	18217				And I saw that, and I saw the situation, and I stood up, and I voted against that, because I was afraid that they couldn't make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred Marines would make a difference.	1
ClaimBuster	18218				Now none of that will happen anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	18219				I would say to them, look at the job retraining programs that we're proposing.	0
ClaimBuster	18220				And I believe we require someone who can work harmoniously with the Congress, who can work closely with the people of this country, and who can bring a new image and a new spirit to Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	18221				Now, what we haven't talked about is Senator McCain's plan.	1
ClaimBuster	18222				I wish the President would say: Yes, the CBO is right.	0
ClaimBuster	18223				Which would be uh - to continue the progress that has been made under the last two uh - courts - the Warren Court and the Burger Court.	0
ClaimBuster	18224				So we can have a tax cut but my priority would be to help the families who need it with child rearing and education and buying a first-time home and helping for health care costs.	0
ClaimBuster	18225				They're breaking business's legs in a number of different ways.	0
ClaimBuster	18226				It has not worked for America.	0
ClaimBuster	18227				George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, so there are differences between Governor Romney and George Bush, but they're not on economic policy.	1
ClaimBuster	18228				And instead of concentrating on tax cuts mostly for the wealthy, we want -- I want tax cuts for the middle-class families and I want to continue the prosperity and make sure that it enriches not just a few but all of our families.	0
ClaimBuster	18229				Now, I'm going to add 40,000 active duty forces to the military, and I'm going to make people feel good about being safe in our military, and not overextended, because I'm going to run a foreign policy that actually does what President Reagan did, President Eisenhower did, and others.	0
ClaimBuster	18230				Government-sponsored health care would lead to rationing.	0
ClaimBuster	18231				How do we get schools to be more competitive?	0
ClaimBuster	18232				We are not a nation in decline.	0
ClaimBuster	18233				General Petraeus has just taken over a position of responsibility, where he has the command and will really set the tone for the strategy and tactics that are used.	1
ClaimBuster	18234				An I don't think that is going to be an effective tool to make the -- keep our society safe.	0
ClaimBuster	18235				No, I didn't say that at all.	1
ClaimBuster	18236				But what is at stake here in this health care issue is the fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	18237				I support a woman's right to choose.	1
ClaimBuster	18238				Mr. Mondale referred to the farmers' worst year.	1
ClaimBuster	18239				And we now know that he was not out of the loop; he was in meeting after meeting listening to Secretary Shultz and Secretary Weinberger opposing that, and yet he supported it.	1
ClaimBuster	18240				And it's very hard for us to project leadership around the world when we're not doing what we need to do...	0
ClaimBuster	18241				I want to fully fund education, No Child Left Behind, special-needs education.	0
ClaimBuster	18242				It's all covered in the plan.	1
ClaimBuster	18243				This is a very, very difficult and fundamental decision that all of us have to make.	0
ClaimBuster	18244				I was born to a widowed mother who gave me family values, and grandparents.	1
ClaimBuster	18245				For example, we uh - proposed about $12 million to add between four and five hundred more employees for the National Park Service.	1
ClaimBuster	18246				It is because America has not invested in its people.	0
ClaimBuster	18247				But there are other things that we can do with the inner cities, and I've believed.	0
ClaimBuster	18248				We're lucky to have her heading the commission.	0
ClaimBuster	18249				That is a misstatement, of course, of my position.	0
ClaimBuster	18250				Our conventional strength in Europe is under strength.	1
ClaimBuster	18251				We passed an area redevelopment bill far more effective than the bill the Administration suggested, on two occasions, and the President vetoed it both times.	1
ClaimBuster	18252				We will not be a great country unless we have a strong family unit in every home.	0
ClaimBuster	18253				The world is more dangerous today.	0
ClaimBuster	18254				This has got to be stopped.	0
ClaimBuster	18255				Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936 that that generation of Americans had a rendezvous with destiny.	1
ClaimBuster	18256				So it's not a question of his heart, as far as I know.	0
ClaimBuster	18257				But with these projections, we will have a balanced budget by fiscal year 1981, if I'm elected president.	0
ClaimBuster	18258				Number 2, with regard to Social Security, that program -- a lot of you may not know this -- it produces a $70 billion surplus a year.	1
ClaimBuster	18259				I believe we can be successful.	0
ClaimBuster	18260				They all have their strengths and they all have their weaknesses.	0
ClaimBuster	18261				That's why we don't have full employment today.	0
ClaimBuster	18262				We need a program for the uninsured.	0
ClaimBuster	18263				One, a lot of folks are still waiting for that 1992 middle-class tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	18264				Mr. Lehrer, I hope we'll have a chance to discuss drugs later in the program.	0
ClaimBuster	18265				It is a large Communist movement to take over the Philippines.	0
ClaimBuster	18266				Just about every family I know, the main concern is how am I going to succeed at work and still do right by my children.	1
ClaimBuster	18267				We didn't have enough forces.	0
ClaimBuster	18268				He is the man on conventional forces that wants to eliminate two carrier battle groups.	0
ClaimBuster	18269				And so, I think that the lines can meet.	0
ClaimBuster	18270				The Kerr bill provided assistance to all those who were not on Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	18271				I don't believe Hillary will.	0
ClaimBuster	18272				Now, I'm not capable, and I don't think you are, any of us, to make this determination that must be made with regard to human life.	0
ClaimBuster	18273				He's also the only president in 72 years to lose jobs -- 1.6 million jobs lost.	1
ClaimBuster	18274				Oh, no, it will cost jobs, but that's not -- let me say this.	0
ClaimBuster	18275				We cut the rate of increase in spending in half.	1
ClaimBuster	18276				And by the way, I just want to make sure -- I can't let him just say something and not correct it.	0
ClaimBuster	18277				This is public ethics; I'm not talking about private ethics.	0
ClaimBuster	18278				The only people that are going to reform Russia are Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	18279				And he stands here and says politicians who make promises like that ought to be ignored.	0
ClaimBuster	18280				For those of you who he wants to scare into the voting booth to vote for him, hear me loud and clear.	0
ClaimBuster	18281				And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and all the people who are watching.	0
ClaimBuster	18282				But at the same time, we gave back to the people of California - in tax rebates, tax credits, tax cuts - $5.7 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	18283				Have a gun-free zone around every school in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	18284				Spain -- Spain spends 42 percent of their total economy on government.	1
ClaimBuster	18285				Fifty-four percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed as individuals.	1
ClaimBuster	18286				If the American people want to do it and not talk about it, then they ought to -- you know, I'm one person they ought to consider.	0
ClaimBuster	18287				I'm the first president ever to allow funding -- federal funding -- for embryonic stem-cell research.	1
ClaimBuster	18288				If you've got health insurance, most of you have seen your premiums double over the last eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	18289				I signed the homeland security bill to better align our assets and resources.	1
ClaimBuster	18290				People have lost their health care or are going bankrupt because they get sick.	0
ClaimBuster	18291				I can't understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	18292				With respect to something like coal, we made the largest investment in clean coal technology, to make sure that even as we're producing more coal, we're producing it cleaner and smarter.	1
ClaimBuster	18293				You showed no recognition of the Administration program to try to persuade Chiang Kai-shek for the last five years to withdraw from the islands.	1
ClaimBuster	18294				Well, look, I think that we do have a disagreement about an across-the-board spending freeze.	1
ClaimBuster	18295				I hope I've earned your trust because a lot of being president is about trust and character.	0
ClaimBuster	18296				Her husband's a pretty tough guy, by the way, too.	0
ClaimBuster	18297				To send their kids to college with a $10,000 tax deduction for college tuition per child per year.	1
ClaimBuster	18298				When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	18299				What grade do you teach?	0
ClaimBuster	18300				Well, because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh - then I think you would have complete uh - economic chaos.	0
ClaimBuster	18301				But the larger point -- and he says this constantly -- is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.	1
ClaimBuster	18302				In January of uh - 1975 I submitted to the Congress and to the American people the first comprehensive energy program recommended by any president.	1
ClaimBuster	18303				I want this next generation to be the best educated in American history, to invest in the human mind and science again, so we're out front.	0
ClaimBuster	18304				That's the kind of approach that is just not going to work.	0
ClaimBuster	18305				And I think our allies would be very happy to go along with a fair and verifiable SALT agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	18306				I want to thank the University of Miami for hosting us.	0
ClaimBuster	18307				He has made the suggestion that what we need is to move in the direction of more government controls, a suggestion that would also mean raising prices uh - that the consumers pay for products and im- and imposing upon the farmers uh - controls on acreage even far more than they have today.	0
ClaimBuster	18308				I'll just make a quick comment about vouchers in D.C.	0
ClaimBuster	18309				Now, the Federal Government is going to turn around and say, well you have this problem; we will now hand you the money to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	18310				So, I would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this.	0
ClaimBuster	18311				I firmly believe, uh - Mr. Kraft, that it's unwise for a president to signal in advance what uh - options he might exercise if any uhh - international problem arose.	0
ClaimBuster	18312				And I'm so proud of what she accomplished in getting them on there.	0
ClaimBuster	18313				Because you're going to decide whether we're going to balance the budget now, but protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	18314				Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do.	0
ClaimBuster	18315				But I also believe that because we are the United States of America, we're a country with a great, unbelievable Constitution, with rights that we afford people, that you can't discriminate in the workplace.	0
ClaimBuster	18316				And I still believe, under the right leadership, our best days are ahead of us.	0
ClaimBuster	18317				And the result was unilateral disarmament.	1
ClaimBuster	18318				Now there isn't a dollar shortage, and yet many of these countries continue to move against our goods.	1
ClaimBuster	18319				See, here is the mentality.	0
ClaimBuster	18320				And let me tell you exactly why I think that the choice he made to give a tax cut for the oil companies and others before addressing this -- I mean, if you were the governor of a state that was dead last in health care for families, and all of a sudden you found yourself with the biggest surplus your state had ever had in its history, wouldn't you want to maybe use some of it to climb from 50th to, say, 45 or 40 or something or maybe better?	0
ClaimBuster	18321				U-2 flight in May just before the conference was a mistake in timing because of the hazards involved, if the summit conference had any hope for success.	0
ClaimBuster	18322				I'll never turn over America's national security needs to leaders of other countries, as we continue to build those alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	18323				But we have made vast improvements in our anti-terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	18324				I think it goes with world leadership, and I think the levels we've come up with are just about right.	0
ClaimBuster	18325				And when she brought a suit, saying equal pay for equal work, the judges said, well, you know, it's taken you too long to bring this lawsuit, even though she didn't know about it until fairly recently.	1
ClaimBuster	18326				But you cannot just get there by balancing the budget.	0
ClaimBuster	18327				You say, well, gee, what are you going to do about that?	0
ClaimBuster	18328				This is a heartless kind of approach to the working families of our country, which is typical of many Republican leaders of the past, but, I think, has been accentuated under Governor Reagan.	0
ClaimBuster	18329				Now, we're not a parliamentary body, the National Governors Association.	1
ClaimBuster	18330				And it would've put uh - very strict uh - uh - control over who owned a handgun.	0
ClaimBuster	18331				In this case, in the case of a financial crisis, I would gather all the facts before I made the decision as to what the government ought or ought not to do.	0
ClaimBuster	18332				It's a matter of leadership or no leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	18333				Nobody's ever seen that before.	0
ClaimBuster	18334				If the -- the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent when he took office, it's 7.8 percent now.	1
ClaimBuster	18335				Doesn't make me popular with the teachers union.	1
ClaimBuster	18336				I would go after Baghdadi.	0
ClaimBuster	18337				But I think the first criteria, Tom, would have to be somebody who immediately Americans identify with, immediately say, we can trust that individual.	0
ClaimBuster	18338				We are not doing that today.	0
ClaimBuster	18339				And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we're good.	0
ClaimBuster	18340				With regard to the employer sanctions, we must have that not only to ensure that we can identify the illegal aliens, but also, while some keep protesting about what it would do to employers, there is another employer that we shouldn't be so concerned about, and these are employers down through the years who have encouraged the illegal entry into this country because they then hire these individuals and hire them at starvation wages and with none of the benefits that we think are normal and natural for workers in our country, and the individuals can't complain because of their illegal status.	0
ClaimBuster	18341				It was in 1964 and that's what he called Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	18342				And so we can be a partner with China.	0
ClaimBuster	18343				I agree with Senator Kennedy's appraisal generally in this respect.	0
ClaimBuster	18344				And it's a question as to whether the United States will continue to lead for peace.	0
ClaimBuster	18345				It is true that earlier, working with some very prominent economists, I had come up, during the campaign, with an economic program that I thought could rectify the great problems confronting us -- the double-digit inflation, the high tax rates that I think were hurting the economy, the stagflation that we were undergoing.	1
ClaimBuster	18346				It can happen in America with the right kind of leadership.	1
ClaimBuster	18347				And it's a bad policy.	0
ClaimBuster	18348				One is to change Head Start to a reading program.	0
ClaimBuster	18349				We took the child to New York.	1
ClaimBuster	18350				I've been there now for fourteen years, the same period of time that he has, so that our experience in uh - government is comparable.	1
ClaimBuster	18351				It's my strong feeling that we ought to sell arms to Iran for its own national security, and as an ally - a strong ally of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	18352				The rate of regulations quadrupled under this president.	1
ClaimBuster	18353				We are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	18354				-- that he's going to be responsible.	0
ClaimBuster	18355				I think if I were a senior citizen I would be a little fed up with all these ads scaring seniors, scaring veterans and scaring students about education.	0
ClaimBuster	18356				Which is why as president, we funded an Iron Dome program to stop those missiles.	1
ClaimBuster	18357				We're spending $10 billion a month in Iraq at a time when the Iraqis have a $79 billion surplus, $79 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	18358				Yes, I think it's fine to do business with them.	0
ClaimBuster	18359				I had never worked in Washington as an elected official.	1
ClaimBuster	18360				And I will fight for the American worker just as hard as I fight for my own job.	0
ClaimBuster	18361				These programs that I described to you earlier - the tax deferrals for overseas, the DISC, and the tax shelters, uh - they only apply to people in the $50 thousand-a-year bracket or up, and I think this is the very best way to approach it.	1
ClaimBuster	18362				It's given us the highest small business failure in 50 years.	1
ClaimBuster	18363				It shows income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million.	1
ClaimBuster	18364				Now, to -- I still -- I just have a minute here?	0
ClaimBuster	18365				You may claim you've got mandatory testing but you don't, Mr. Vice President.	0
ClaimBuster	18366				We've got to understand in America that we've got to have growth, create more jobs and more opportunities in the private sector.	0
ClaimBuster	18367				The fact is that there was already a law on the books in Illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment, which is why not only myself but pro-choice Republicans and Democrats voted against it.	1
ClaimBuster	18368				9 Nobel Prize-winning economists and 500 others, including numerous Republican and Democratic business executives, have endorsed this approach because it offers the best hope to put America back to work and get our incomes rising instead of falling.	1
ClaimBuster	18369				The question of agriculture came up a minute ago.	1
ClaimBuster	18370				(Applause) I'd like to have that line-item veto for the president, because I think that would be extraordinarily helpful.	0
ClaimBuster	18371				And this president, I regret to say, has secured less nuclear material in the last two years since 9/11 than we did in the two years preceding 9/11.	1
ClaimBuster	18372				I have heard you say this time after time.	0
ClaimBuster	18373				But let's look at the performance.	0
ClaimBuster	18374				And we do have to have change and people who never take responsibility for anything when it happens on their watch and people who are in charge --	0
ClaimBuster	18375				Wouldn't it make a lot more sense if the government let them keep their own money there in the first place?	0
ClaimBuster	18376				I want to spend my time making this country even better than it is, not trying to make you out to be a bad person.	0
ClaimBuster	18377				The first position you took, when this matter first came up, was that we should draw the line and commit ourselves, as a matter of principle, to defend these islands.	1
ClaimBuster	18378				That's -- Governor, you're the last person who's going to get tough on China.	0
ClaimBuster	18379				We know how to get control of the debt.	0
ClaimBuster	18380				I don't think that's true at all.	0
ClaimBuster	18381				And for that reason he has contributed to any lack of prestige.	0
ClaimBuster	18382				And talk about not quitting, I'm spending my money on this campaign; the 2 parties are spending your money, taxpayer money.	1
ClaimBuster	18383				I only have 30 seconds.	1
ClaimBuster	18384				[Laughter] If they're antisatellite weapons, I assume they're going to be aimed against satellites.	0
ClaimBuster	18385				And that's one of the reasons the Afghan Security Forces have so much work to do to be able to fight against that.	0
ClaimBuster	18386				But look who's around with him there.	0
ClaimBuster	18387				Then a lot of mutual distrust developed.	0
ClaimBuster	18388				We cannot afford an intelligence gap.	0
ClaimBuster	18389				Syria is Iran's only ally in the Arab world.	1
ClaimBuster	18390				Instead, I want to build the Midgetman, which is mobile and thus less vulnerable, contributing to stability, and a weapon that will give us security and contribute to an incentive for arms control.	0
ClaimBuster	18391				The Reagan-Bush administration was right.	0
ClaimBuster	18392				And I do believe it would be inhibiting.	0
ClaimBuster	18393				So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.	0
ClaimBuster	18394				And the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the Secretary of State, our U.N.	0
ClaimBuster	18395				I've been a tolerant person all my life.	0
ClaimBuster	18396				No, actually, I think Senator McCain and I agree for the most part on these issues.	0
ClaimBuster	18397				And that, too, is a major difference between the vice president and me.	0
ClaimBuster	18398				We've got to stop some of these frivolous lawsuits.	0
ClaimBuster	18399				Now, I know millions of you still have anxieties.	0
ClaimBuster	18400				It's what we stand for.	0
ClaimBuster	18401				Back to Iran, just for a second.	0
ClaimBuster	18402				Doctors practice defensive medicine because of all the frivolous lawsuits that cost our government $28 billion a year.	1
ClaimBuster	18403				And in a war, there's a lot of -- there's a lot of tactical decisions that historians will look back and say: He shouldn't have done that.	0
ClaimBuster	18404				Now let me talk about what we've done in the White House as far as federal employees are concerned The first order that I issued after I became president was to cut or eliminate the prospective forty-thousand increase in federal employees that had been scheduled by my predecessor.	1
ClaimBuster	18405				But the efficiency of it, the simplicity of it, the uh ability of people to understand their own government and control it was a - was a uh - substantial benefit derived from complete reorganization.	0
ClaimBuster	18406				Well I think we should be no - under no illusions whatever about what the responsibilities of the American people will be in the sixties.	0
ClaimBuster	18407				That was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	18408				And the reason that it must grow even more is because we have things to do at home and also because we're in a race for survival - a race in which it isn't enough to be ahead; it isn't enough simply to be complacent.	0
ClaimBuster	18409				And you let those people go with the guidelines of overall policy, not looking over their shoulder and nitpicking the manner in which they go at the job.	0
ClaimBuster	18410				Energy -- well, first -- second of all, energy independence.	0
ClaimBuster	18411				Now there's what's called an Independent Review Organization that you have to go through first.	1
ClaimBuster	18412				We are going to appoint justices -- this is the best way to help the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	18413				I don't believe that there is anything this country cannot do.	0
ClaimBuster	18414				That's what got me into this race, so we could rebuild the American economy.	0
ClaimBuster	18415				See, we have an adversarial relationship between government and business.	0
ClaimBuster	18416				But we're going to have to use more gas, more coal and more safe nuclear power for our energy base.	0
ClaimBuster	18417				It leaves a hundred miles between the sea.	1
ClaimBuster	18418				If we do those things we will build that bridge to the 21st Century and the greatest country in history will be even greater.	0
ClaimBuster	18419				It failed because the House did not pass it and the House failed by eleven votes.	1
ClaimBuster	18420				We all know the possibility of terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	18421				Growth in the economy is gonna add to the overall prosperity and wealth.	0
ClaimBuster	18422				Seventy five percent of them have been brought to justice.	1
ClaimBuster	18423				The major threat is external and will continue.	0
ClaimBuster	18424				But this president hasn't even held the kind of statesman-like summits that pull people together and get them to invest in those states.	1
ClaimBuster	18425				Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our troops.	0
ClaimBuster	18426				And we better be awfully careful.	0
ClaimBuster	18427				We shouldn't be using food.	0
ClaimBuster	18428				I would not agree to any negotiations or any agreement that involved conduct on the part of the Soviet Union that we couldn't verify every day.	0
ClaimBuster	18429				But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself.	0
ClaimBuster	18430				It seems to me that we can go from there to uh - the uh - grain sales.	0
ClaimBuster	18431				And you folks out there are going to have to choose who you think is right.	0
ClaimBuster	18432				Bundles of cash as big as this stage.	1
ClaimBuster	18433				I always believed he was a threat.	0
ClaimBuster	18434				I think it's a fundamental difference.	0
ClaimBuster	18435				So, there seems to be no shortage of investment capital.	0
ClaimBuster	18436				And by the way, the breach on the agreement was not through plutonium.	1
ClaimBuster	18437				Our enterprise zones, that we hear a lot of lip service about in Congress, would bring jobs into the inner city.	0
ClaimBuster	18438				And that's why we've got to make some investments and I've called for investments in solar, wind, geothermal.	1
ClaimBuster	18439				And using that money, we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600, and we were also able to make a -- make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the -- throughout the system.	1
ClaimBuster	18440				"But let me tell you, point blank, the lines of stem cells that he's made available, every scientist in the country will tell you, ""Not adequate,"" because they're contaminated by mouse cells, and because there aren't 60 or 70 -- they're are only about 11 to 20 now -- and there aren't enough to be able to do the research because they're contaminated."	1
ClaimBuster	18441				My hope for America is a prosperous America, a hopeful America and a safer world.	0
ClaimBuster	18442				It makes you realize that whoever is president is going to be a man that all the children of America will either look up to, or will look down to.	0
ClaimBuster	18443				$665 billion over ten years for the wealthiest 1%.	1
ClaimBuster	18444				First of all, of course I know Osama bin Laden attacked us.	0
ClaimBuster	18445				And a lot of our military are underpaid.	1
ClaimBuster	18446				The allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another, and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation.	0
ClaimBuster	18447				There are great plans lying all over Washington nobody ever executes.	0
ClaimBuster	18448				And that question can only be answered by someone with the knowledge and experience and the judgment, the judgment to know when our national security is not only at risk, but where the United States of America can make a difference in preventing genocide, in preventing the spread of terrorism, in doing the things that the United States has done, not always well, but we've done because we're a nation of good.	0
ClaimBuster	18449				And, Tom, I know that we're under time constraints, but Senator McCain through a lot of stuff out there.	0
ClaimBuster	18450				They'll pay off our national debt.	0
ClaimBuster	18451				And the reason they blame Russia because they think they're trying to tarnish me with Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	18452				But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there.	1
ClaimBuster	18453				Ninety percent are on the honor role.	1
ClaimBuster	18454				Of course we're meeting our obligation to our veterans, and the veterans know that.	0
ClaimBuster	18455				We have fewer people working today than we had when the president took office.	1
ClaimBuster	18456				When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don't want them.	1
ClaimBuster	18457				When they protested that and suggested a smaller number, perhaps, I went along with that.	1
ClaimBuster	18458				We can do better than this.	0
ClaimBuster	18459				They're not the secrets to the nuclear bomb.	1
ClaimBuster	18460				We have good executive orders, and the CIA and the DIA and NASA uh - uh - NSA are now doing a good job under proper supervision.	0
ClaimBuster	18461				And the reason we've gotten it is because they see us now as unwilling to make the very kinds of unilateral cuts that have been called for and to go for the discredited freeze.	0
ClaimBuster	18462				I don't think that can be better illustrated than in the case of guaranteeing women equal rights under the Constitution of our nation.	0
ClaimBuster	18463				I would say to that person exactly what I will say to you right now.	0
ClaimBuster	18464				Look at the evidence of the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	18465				I think they're taxed too much.	0
ClaimBuster	18466				Those are some of the great issues - atomic warfare, the use of our natural resources, and the issue of nationalism - that I intend to be talking about in the remaining six weeks of this campaign, and I dare hope that the American people will be listening and that they will see that an Independent government of John Anderson and Patrick Lucey can give us the kind of coalition government that we need in 1980 to begin to solve our problems.	0
ClaimBuster	18467				Taxing people over $200,000 will not get you $150 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	18468				And guess who would get shuffled through?	0
ClaimBuster	18469				I've been paying taxes just like you and Lord knows, I've paid my share -- over a billion in taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	18470				She immediately -- when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	18471				... it's hard to get there from here.	0
ClaimBuster	18472				He had the facts that were released today immediately after the Mayaguez incident.	1
ClaimBuster	18473				I think that it has to be administered not only fairly with attention to things like DNA evidence, which I think should be used in all capital cases, but also with very careful attention.	0
ClaimBuster	18474				The VA provides lower-cost drugs to our veterans.	1
ClaimBuster	18475				And the initiatives that we took in southern Africa are the best examples of what this administration is doing and will continue to do in the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	18476				"Not only that, he said, ""I think that's what grows the economy."""	1
ClaimBuster	18477				We're talking about a massive government, folks.	0
ClaimBuster	18478				Real interest rates -- the real cost of interest -- will remain very, very high, and many economists are predicting that we're moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession.	0
ClaimBuster	18479				I'm not going to wear rose-colored glasses when it comes to Russia, or Mr. Putin.	0
ClaimBuster	18480				the air pollution standard laws that were passed in California were passed over the objections of Governor Reagan, and this is a very well-known fact.	1
ClaimBuster	18481				This president has turned his back on the wellness of America.	0
ClaimBuster	18482				So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	18483				We are so outplayed on missiles, on cease-fires.	1
ClaimBuster	18484				... for weeks -- I've been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it's the harbor of where -- you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are.	1
ClaimBuster	18485				One size does not fit all.	0
ClaimBuster	18486				We will take out ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	18487				So I'm very honored by all of that.	0
ClaimBuster	18488				And we should make sure that we give them a pathway to citizenship.	0
ClaimBuster	18489				Both parties carry a huge blame for that on their shoulders.	1
ClaimBuster	18490				"And that's against -- my lawyers, they say, ""Don't do it."""	1
ClaimBuster	18491				(Applause) I have been in politics for twenty-five years, Margaret; I've won a lot of elections, I've lost a few, as you know, and learned from those losses.	1
ClaimBuster	18492				A president should be the same thing to all people.	0
ClaimBuster	18493				And they're proving today, every state, that they can manage them adequately.	0
ClaimBuster	18494				And under both President Nixon and Ford, monies have been impounded that would've gone to uh - cities and others to control uh - water pollution.	1
ClaimBuster	18495				And what we have to do is restrain the growth of spending.	0
ClaimBuster	18496				So this is a serious threat.	0
ClaimBuster	18497				This is the kind of policies that ultimately end up undermining our ability to fight the war on terrorism, and it will change when I'm president.	1
ClaimBuster	18498				Economic growth is the key to the future of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	18499				I don't believe in trickle-down government, I don't believe in larger taxes and larger government spending.	0
ClaimBuster	18500				The federal government is going to run it.	0
ClaimBuster	18501				And I told Mr. Gromyko we don't like their system.	1
ClaimBuster	18502				I'll bet you, you may never even have heard of them before this crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	18503				It's important we go beyond those old partisan arguments and focus on people and their future.	0
ClaimBuster	18504				Yeah, yeah, we've heard -- we've heard this before, Hillary.	1
ClaimBuster	18505				It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?	0
ClaimBuster	18506				And he ought to be proud of it, it's part of his record.	0
ClaimBuster	18507				And Iran and Iraq are now more dangerous -- Iran and North Korea are now more dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	18508				We have to be sure to maintain that.	0
ClaimBuster	18509				But who's going to get Mosul, really?	0
ClaimBuster	18510				The individual worker in the plants throughout the United States should not be a small cog in a big machine.	0
ClaimBuster	18511				Well, I think -- listen, I fully agree that one should shift tactics, and we will, in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	18512				And there we would give statutory authority to the Committee on Government Contracts, which is an effective way of getting real progress made in this area, since about one out of every four jobs is held by and is allotted by people who have government contracts.	1
ClaimBuster	18513				Mr. George Allen, the head of our information service, said that a result of our being second in space, in the sputnik in 1957, and I quote him, I believe I paraphrase him accurately.	1
ClaimBuster	18514				He believes only the right people ought to get tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	18515				But I don't agree with a lot of - most of the positions of the ACLU.	0
ClaimBuster	18516				We've expanded trade adjustment assistance.	1
ClaimBuster	18517				Ask the people in the armed forces today.	0
ClaimBuster	18518				And the last point I just want to make.	0
ClaimBuster	18519				You don't help yourself with other nations when you turn away from the global warming treaty, for instance, or when you refuse to deal at length with the United Nations.	0
ClaimBuster	18520				The other is John Neuhaus, who's one of the most distinguished arms control specialists in our country.	1
ClaimBuster	18521				You know, four years ago, I said that I'm not a perfect man and I wouldn't be a perfect president.	1
ClaimBuster	18522				And you were right then, George, when you said it was no time for partisan demagoguery.	0
ClaimBuster	18523				The fact of the matter is it was a bill that was less than you recommended, Mr. Nixon, this morning in your proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	18524				Senator McCain, in the rush to go into Iraq, said, you know what?	0
ClaimBuster	18525				I've shown I know how to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	18526				We're the second biggest state -- farming state in the country.	1
ClaimBuster	18527				Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that we'll be better off.	1
ClaimBuster	18528				That was a terrible time for our country.	0
ClaimBuster	18529				And so, of course we want to bring international pressures to bear on Russia in hopes that that will modify and eventually change their behavior.	0
ClaimBuster	18530				If you make less than $60,000 a year and you decide to invest $1,000 in a savings account, you'll get a tax credit, which means in essence that the federal government will match your $1,000 with another $1,000.	1
ClaimBuster	18531				We may have different approaches in terms of how we deal with local folks.	0
ClaimBuster	18532				We pay for it by shutting that loophole overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	18533				I don't think it's enough to come before the American people who are watching us tonight and say, well, I haven't sorted it out.	0
ClaimBuster	18534				First of all, let me sharply disagree with the President on sharing the most advanced, the most dangerous, the most important technology in America with the Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	18535				But I do think that it is important for the federal government to step up and help local school districts do some of the things they need to do.	0
ClaimBuster	18536				I want you to be very happy.	0
ClaimBuster	18537				Our recession was one of the shallowest in modern history.	1
ClaimBuster	18538				And simply to say, well, the McKinney bill will do it just doesn't do.	0
ClaimBuster	18539				But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I'm proposing.	1
ClaimBuster	18540				And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country.	0
ClaimBuster	18541				Only the United States put the sanctions on alone, and that's exactly what I'm talking about.	1
ClaimBuster	18542				And let me tell you what the record shows.	0
ClaimBuster	18543				I believe in limited government.	0
ClaimBuster	18544				First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business.	1
ClaimBuster	18545				My whole administration is about your future.	0
ClaimBuster	18546				They can't impose arbitrary lifetime limits.	1
ClaimBuster	18547				Now, when anybody has a spending program they want to spend money on at home, they say, well, let's cut money out of the Defense Dept.	0
ClaimBuster	18548				I will go very quickly.	0
ClaimBuster	18549				So, this is a very difficult situation.	0
ClaimBuster	18550				Well, I've been through this before, Mr. Gannon, as the governor of Georgia.	1
ClaimBuster	18551				Instead of squabbling and finger pointing, he gets immediate help.	0
ClaimBuster	18552				Some of these weapons have 10 megatons of explosion.	1
ClaimBuster	18553				And if we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out, then I think that we have to act and we will take them out.	0
ClaimBuster	18554				I did it for the very reasons you say.	1
ClaimBuster	18555				And smart means not diverting your attention from the real war on terror in Afghanistan against Osama bin Laden and taking if off to Iraq where the 9/11 Commission confirms there was no connection to 9/11 itself and Saddam Hussein, and where the reason for going to war was weapons of mass destruction, not the removal of Saddam Hussein.	1
ClaimBuster	18556				All I want to do, if you've already got health care, is lower your costs.	0
ClaimBuster	18557				I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so...	0
ClaimBuster	18558				Russia hasn't paid any attention to ISIS.	1
ClaimBuster	18559				We have a democracy in Portugal today.	1
ClaimBuster	18560				I am not going to roll over, as Mr. Mondale suggests, and give them something that could turn around and be used against us.	0
ClaimBuster	18561				Now, does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money, when they're making money every time you go to the pump?	0
ClaimBuster	18562				We've spent 65 years now on the development of a hybrid system, partly private, partly public, and 85% of our people have health insurance, 15% don't.	1
ClaimBuster	18563				Winds of freedom blowing around the world, Russia demilitarizing.	1
ClaimBuster	18564				But now less than a third of our people can afford to buy their own homes.	1
ClaimBuster	18565				I'll veto anything that takes money out of Social Security or Medicare for anything other than Social Security or Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	18566				I also intend to double the number of special forces so that we can do the job we need to do with respect fighting the terrorists around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	18567				I don't think you understood what was -- this was locker room talk.	0
ClaimBuster	18568				One-quarter of the surplus for important projects, and I want to send one-quarter of the surplus back to the people who pay the bills.	0
ClaimBuster	18569				The Congress of the United States appropriated six hundred and seventy-seven million dollars mare than the President was willing to use up till a week ago.	1
ClaimBuster	18570				My name wasn't even there.	1
ClaimBuster	18571				He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower.	1
ClaimBuster	18572				And without a college level job, that's just unacceptable.	0
ClaimBuster	18573				We're not going to do that in my administration.	0
ClaimBuster	18574				I've got the scars to prove it.	1
ClaimBuster	18575				These things can be done if we have the right vision and the right restraint and the right leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	18576				Today in America more minorities own a home than ever before.	1
ClaimBuster	18577				We all thought there was weapons there, Robin.	0
ClaimBuster	18578				But it requires, I think, a recognition that politics as usual, as been practiced over the last several years, is not solving the big problems here in America.	0
ClaimBuster	18579				It's a very proud moment for me.	0
ClaimBuster	18580				Let me just mention, Senator Dole voted for $900 billion in tax increases.	1
ClaimBuster	18581				I think that we have to help parents and strengthen families by dealing with the kind of inappropriate entertainment material that families are just heart sick that their children are exposed to.	0
ClaimBuster	18582				And we're going to stay engaged, as long as I'm president, working to improve things.	0
ClaimBuster	18583				I have never said we should write it into law if there is evidence that that goal cannot be achieved.	1
ClaimBuster	18584				When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened.	0
ClaimBuster	18585				They were presidents at historic times.	1
ClaimBuster	18586				I can remember the fires that swept Parker County, Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	18587				Whether or not you have the capacity to convince people to follow?	0
ClaimBuster	18588				So it I think is very important for us to let them assume more and more of the burden and for us to bring that money back here and rebuild our infrastructure, because we can only be a superpower if we are an economic superpower; and we can only be an economic superpower if we have a growing, expanding job base.	0
ClaimBuster	18589				I mean that's how our free market works.	1
ClaimBuster	18590				After all, I was a border governor for a while.	1
ClaimBuster	18591				We didn't have access to their markets.	1
ClaimBuster	18592				Jim, let me just come back on that -- on that point, which is these...	0
ClaimBuster	18593				I know we've got to encourage democracy in the marketplaces.	0
ClaimBuster	18594				And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful.	0
ClaimBuster	18595				And as I measure the words of the Bible -- and we all do; different people measure different things -- the Koran, the Torah, or, you know, Native Americans who gave me a blessing the other day had their own special sense of connectedness to a higher being.	0
ClaimBuster	18596				I felt like there needed to be a better sense of responsibility of what was going on in the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	18597				We're going to get through a very aggressive energy policy, 31/2 million more jobs in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	18598				It provides a choice of having either government insurance or private insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	18599				But let's -- let's mention -- let me mention the other one.	0
ClaimBuster	18600				No, I would make some changes.	0
ClaimBuster	18601				Middle-income families are being crushed.	0
ClaimBuster	18602				Every system that is verifiable should be placed on the table for negotiations for an agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	18603				So, the polls are interesting, but uh - I don't know how to explain the fluctuation.	0
ClaimBuster	18604				I know we have to, but this is a classic example of walking the walk and talking the talk.	0
ClaimBuster	18605				Called James Watt an excellent Secretary of the Interior?	0
ClaimBuster	18606				And it's not tax and spend economics.	0
ClaimBuster	18607				Only about half the people in this country have pension plans.	1
ClaimBuster	18608				Well, we may not always have national security issues at stake, but we have moral issues at stake.	0
ClaimBuster	18609				Mr. Bush says we are going to put the IRS on every taxpayer.	1
ClaimBuster	18610				Well, I believe in the town hall meetings; they started with my campaign in New Hampshire.	1
ClaimBuster	18611				It is going to be requiring all of us -- Democrats, Republicans, independents -- to come together and to renew a spirit of sacrifice and service and responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	18612				Well, let's admit it then.	0
ClaimBuster	18613				And they weren't part of the negotiations, and I understand that.	0
ClaimBuster	18614				I want a Supreme Court that understands because you're wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn't mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.	0
ClaimBuster	18615				All of the things that I said we would do, from inflation being down, interest rates being down, unemployment falling, all of those things we have done.	1
ClaimBuster	18616				So I would say just, you know, look at all three of us.	0
ClaimBuster	18617				I think it is important that the US stay in Europe and continue to guarantee the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	18618				But, you know, let's talk about what's really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election.	1
ClaimBuster	18619				Besides which, it is illegal, because the law of the land, passed by Congress, says that we cannot accept a treaty in which we are not equal.	1
ClaimBuster	18620				I don't think there are any villains inside government on this issue, but there's sure a lot of people who don't understand business.	0
ClaimBuster	18621				Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate.	0
ClaimBuster	18622				Perhaps in no area do we disagree more than this administration's policies on human rights.	0
ClaimBuster	18623				I know what it's like in dark times.	0
ClaimBuster	18624				They're murderers and some very bad people.	1
ClaimBuster	18625				Or, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective?	0
ClaimBuster	18626				That would be my answer to this question.	0
ClaimBuster	18627				Many of them are now the contras.	1
ClaimBuster	18628				So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it we're having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference.	1
ClaimBuster	18629				This conspiracy theory, which he's been spewing out for quite some time.	0
ClaimBuster	18630				Before even the election day, something that none of those economists had even predicted had happened, that the economy was so worsened that I was openly saying that what we had thought on the basis of our plan could have brought a balanced budget -- no, that was no longer possible.	1
ClaimBuster	18631				Bob, anybody can play with these votes.	0
ClaimBuster	18632				The rate of defense spending increase can be slowed.	0
ClaimBuster	18633				Show them by Christmas the first cut at these plans.	0
ClaimBuster	18634				We're continuing to increase manpower and equipment.	1
ClaimBuster	18635				We have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better.	0
ClaimBuster	18636				They discussed the possibility of a small training unit or having a total takeover of the training in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	18637				But I want to emphasize one point to all Americans tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	18638				I have made recommendations on that and I have discussed them previously and I will spell them out further in the campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	18639				Did you hear him say that Congress just voted to increase student loans and scholarships?	1
ClaimBuster	18640				I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a -- to a school that he's being more successful.	0
ClaimBuster	18641				Everywhere I go on the campaign trail I see moms and dads whose son or daughter may wear the uniform and they tell me about how discouraged their son or daughter may be.	1
ClaimBuster	18642				You know, Sam Rayburn once said that if two people agree on everything then only one person is doing the thinking.	1
ClaimBuster	18643				But you have no plan.	0
ClaimBuster	18644				That would not start a war.	0
ClaimBuster	18645				And I will support those reforms, and I will fund the ones that are reformed.	0
ClaimBuster	18646				Of course, we have to work together, and, of course, it's vital that we do so and help these young women who are facing such a difficult decision, with a compassion, that we'll help them with the adoptive services, with the courage to bring that child into this world and we'll help take care of it.	0
ClaimBuster	18647				And that's what concerns me.	0
ClaimBuster	18648				And we've got to create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	18649				This is a question of organizing the housing community.	0
ClaimBuster	18650				I'm not satisfied when the Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are.	1
ClaimBuster	18651				I know that you and your running mate keep saying that and I know it's a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but it's just not the case.	0
ClaimBuster	18652				I believe in the American dream.	0
ClaimBuster	18653				So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look.	0
ClaimBuster	18654				The governor has proposed skipping a generation of technology.	1
ClaimBuster	18655				And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country.	0
ClaimBuster	18656				I'm ready to sign that bill right now.	0
ClaimBuster	18657				I've been standing up to big Hollywood, big trial lawyers.	1
ClaimBuster	18658				The records show that President Roosevelt vetoed an average of fifty-five bills a year.	1
ClaimBuster	18659				He -- he -- he objects...	0
ClaimBuster	18660				Let's talk about them separately.	0
ClaimBuster	18661				If it sounds incredible that I would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant, that's because it's not true.	0
ClaimBuster	18662				We must have a great goal.	0
ClaimBuster	18663				These are very fine institutions, very fine banks.	0
ClaimBuster	18664				6 billion dollars for Pell Grants, very, very important.	1
ClaimBuster	18665				And we must extend the benefits of our own commitment to peace, to create a peaceful world.	0
ClaimBuster	18666				I remember the 2000 campaign, people said if George W. gets elected, your check will be taken away.	1
ClaimBuster	18667				I think the American people are too.	0
ClaimBuster	18668				So that's what I'll do as president.	0
ClaimBuster	18669				If they just want to keep slow dancing and talk about it and not do it, I'm not your man.	0
ClaimBuster	18670				And so will the former President, yes.	0
ClaimBuster	18671				But my job is to ask two questions, sir.	0
ClaimBuster	18672				Recently his key economic adviser was asked about why he didn't seem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college and the response was, well, you know, we can't give money to every interest group that comes along.	1
ClaimBuster	18673				And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	18674				And we honor all the service that they've provided.	1
ClaimBuster	18675				"That's why in my speech to the Congress I said: There's an ""Axis of Evil,"" Iraq, Iran and North Korea, and we're paying attention to it."	1
ClaimBuster	18676				So, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com.	0
ClaimBuster	18677				We'll have 125,000 trained by the end of December.	1
ClaimBuster	18678				It's as simple as that.	0
ClaimBuster	18679				I'm going to continue to push on this issue for the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	18680				There is uh - uh an additional factor that needs to be done and covered very - very succinctly, and that is, to make sure that we have a good relationship between management - business on the one hand, and labor, on the other.	0
ClaimBuster	18681				And what we've also done is engaged these governments in the kind of reforms that are actually going to make a difference in people's lives day to day, to make sure that their governments aren't corrupt, to make sure that they're treating women with the kind of respect and dignity that every nation that succeeds has shown and to make sure that they've got a free market system that works.	1
ClaimBuster	18682				They send it to Congress, and we have to vote it up or down.	1
ClaimBuster	18683				And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do.	1
ClaimBuster	18684				It does not put a deficit on the Treasury.	1
ClaimBuster	18685				I can just tell you, I'm a person who respects other people.	0
ClaimBuster	18686				Over 20 years in the United States Senate, I've worked with John McCain, who's sitting here, I've worked with other colleagues.	1
ClaimBuster	18687				And we estimate we can cut the average family's premium by about $2,500 per year.	1
ClaimBuster	18688				And what my worry is is that, you know, it looks like it's from Canada, and it might be from a third world.	0
ClaimBuster	18689				In 1975 he wanted to cut the budget $15 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	18690				We either have a border or we don't.	0
ClaimBuster	18691				Naval Academy, the first military graduate since uh - Eisenhower.	1
ClaimBuster	18692				Let me say again, we've had over 200 separate trade agreements in the last four years.	1
ClaimBuster	18693				I think the vast majority of Americans believe in them.	0
ClaimBuster	18694				Now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can't believe it.	1
ClaimBuster	18695				I've met with them, I know them, I've spent time in South America-speak the language, so does Senator Bentsen.	1
ClaimBuster	18696				I have fought against that as a senator.	1
ClaimBuster	18697				I would disagree with it.	0
ClaimBuster	18698				Those that can afford it are going to buy in themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	18699				Governor Engler of Michigan cut taxes 21 times, created a lot of new jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	18700				... and admirals, 21 endorsing me, 21 congressional Medal of Honor recipients.	1
ClaimBuster	18701				I've done it my entire life.	1
ClaimBuster	18702				Her science class was supposed to be for 24 students.	1
ClaimBuster	18703				Now, if won't be, General Waller would be -- you say, why do you keep picking military people.	0
ClaimBuster	18704				"Now, some people have said, ""Ah, that would make war imminent, because they would think that we could launch a first strike because we could defend against the enemy.''"	0
ClaimBuster	18705				We haven't done enough in terms of transit; we haven't done enough in terms of ports.	0
ClaimBuster	18706				I see a time when the Internet-based activities are more available in the rural areas and where the extra source of income that farm families used to have from shoe factories is replaced by an extra source of income from working in the information economy.	0
ClaimBuster	18707				I'll tell you exactly how I can do it: by reinstating what President Bush took away, which is called pay as you go.	0
ClaimBuster	18708				It's under, there's been no consideration of it, no discussion of it.	0
ClaimBuster	18709				What will be the leadership of the president in these areas to provide equality of opportunity for employment?	0
ClaimBuster	18710				Well, I understand, and Africa is important.	0
ClaimBuster	18711				I will stand with Israel if they are attacked.	0
ClaimBuster	18712				On the question of admission of Red China, only two countries in all of Africa voted with us - Liberia and the Union of South Africa.	1
ClaimBuster	18713				Kind of gets your head straight about where the taxes, year in and year out, have gotta come from.	0
ClaimBuster	18714				You've been doing this for 30 years.	1
ClaimBuster	18715				As a governor, I thought please, give me this program.	0
ClaimBuster	18716				I'm going to wait until I see that that inflation rate is going down, before I even begin to phase in the business tax cuts that I've talked about.	0
ClaimBuster	18717				We've been dealing with him; he's been dealing drugs to our kids.	1
ClaimBuster	18718				It is a very difficult environment.	0
ClaimBuster	18719				And there might be some feeling of unfairness about this because he was not here to respond.	0
ClaimBuster	18720				But I have an obligation to fight to make sure there are no failing schools.	0
ClaimBuster	18721				I told them in early '95.	1
ClaimBuster	18722				I'm used to people saying something that's not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping I'll believe it.	0
ClaimBuster	18723				Now, again this statement that somehow, I wanted to destroy it and I just changed my tune, that I am for voluntary Social Security, which would mean the ruin of it.	0
ClaimBuster	18724				I vetoed the strip-mining bill, Mr. Kraft, because it was the overwhelming consensus of knowledgeable people that that strip-mining bill would have meant the loss of literally uh - thousands of jobs, something around a hundred and forty thousand jabs.	1
ClaimBuster	18725				I oppose subsidies for ethanol because I thought it distorted the market and created inflation; Senator Obama supported those subsidies.	1
ClaimBuster	18726				Well let me say very quickly that under President Johnson, in spite of the massive investment in the Vietnam War, he turned over a balanced budget to Mr. Nixon.	1
ClaimBuster	18727				It would seem to me again that it is very difficult to blame the four Republicans for the eight Democrats' not getting a something through that particular committee.	0
ClaimBuster	18728				Seventy-five percent of the people live in the cities.	1
ClaimBuster	18729				And then if a little of it comes my way, they load it up with Christmas trees and tax increases, and I have to stand up and favor the taxpayer.	0
ClaimBuster	18730				Now, as for 20,000 new bureaucrats, as you call them, you know, the size of the federal government will go down in a Gore administration.	1
ClaimBuster	18731				And this is part of that liberal establishment, one of those liberal things that you just can't do.	0
ClaimBuster	18732				It has not worked in Iran, it has not worked in North Korea.	1
ClaimBuster	18733				That would obviously be a ridiculous thing for anyone to do who wanted to be president of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	18734				I think the greatest possibilities of our country, our dreams and our hopes, are out there just waiting for us to grab onto them.	0
ClaimBuster	18735				That's not an energy strategy for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	18736				I just think, Jim, that this is an absolutely unique period in world history.	0
ClaimBuster	18737				That's what our message is to the people watching.	0
ClaimBuster	18738				And this was August, a year ago.	1
ClaimBuster	18739				Let me answer your question and I hope it doesn't get too personal or maudlin.	0
ClaimBuster	18740				Students who are out there trying to hopefully advance their own dreams, but also this country's dreams.	0
ClaimBuster	18741				We've had dozens we've had dozens and dozens of officials in this Administration who have left under a cloud, who have left with the special prosecutor in their arm, have been indicted, convicted.	1
ClaimBuster	18742				Part of what had happened is we'd forgotten why we had gone.	0
ClaimBuster	18743				Now, for every dollar that I propose to spend on education, he spends $5 on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%.	1
ClaimBuster	18744				Going around this country, I think that I have found a great hunger in America for a spiritual revival.	0
ClaimBuster	18745				They don't give you all the details that tax returns would.	1
ClaimBuster	18746				And he continues to support a failed policy in Central America which is getting worse and worse, and which has in fact increased Cuban and Soviet influence in that region.	1
ClaimBuster	18747				My chief of staff, for instance, had two kids that were still in school.	1
ClaimBuster	18748				The average working person can't - uh - can't take advantage of that, but the - the wealthier people - uh can.	0
ClaimBuster	18749				The president rushed our nation to war without a plan to win the peace.	1
ClaimBuster	18750				And the challenges America faces right now -- look, the reason I'm in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	18751				I think everybody knows that.	0
ClaimBuster	18752				And the fact is, it's gotten pretty tough.	0
ClaimBuster	18753				So I'll take the pledge and will stay on the issues.	0
ClaimBuster	18754				But when you go to put somebody else's son or daughter into war, I think you got to be a little bit careful and you have to be sure that there's a military plan that can do this.	0
ClaimBuster	18755				A family of four making $40,000 received about $1,700 in tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	18756				I don't know if the vice president agrees with that.	0
ClaimBuster	18757				Well, I'm opposed to discrimination in any form but I don't favor creating special rights for any group.	0
ClaimBuster	18758				That's part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy.	0
ClaimBuster	18759				I think there were a lot of decisions that were bad.	0
ClaimBuster	18760				Every 12-year-old can log in on the Internet.	1
ClaimBuster	18761				And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are.	0
ClaimBuster	18762				It's really -- it's really very interesting.	0
ClaimBuster	18763				They're willing to work with us.	1
ClaimBuster	18764				if Pittsburgh does not have the money to fix the leaking water mains, it's because the Federal Government has pre-empted.	0
ClaimBuster	18765				I would suggest he start by canceling some of those new spending program that he has.	0
ClaimBuster	18766				We continue to pursue our policy of disrupting those who proliferate weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	18767				So have a lot of Americans who are facing challenges.	0
ClaimBuster	18768				I'll be glad to take a shot at it.	0
ClaimBuster	18769				It's been very strong since I've been president.	0
ClaimBuster	18770				But you make a very good point, which is that the place you put your money just makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is.	0
ClaimBuster	18771				I think these assault weapons are a problem.	0
ClaimBuster	18772				And then, on the floor of the State Senate, as he did 130 times as a state senator, he voted present.	1
ClaimBuster	18773				I was able also to get our schools ranked number one in the nation, so 100 percent of our kids would have a bright opportunity for a future.	1
ClaimBuster	18774				That's what's at stake in this election.	0
ClaimBuster	18775				There was hatred, there was divisiveness - uh people had lost faith in their government in many, many respects.	0
ClaimBuster	18776				But I'm not going to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	18777				"And he said, ""Yes, I think that's fair."""	1
ClaimBuster	18778				We're going to bring that pipeline in from Canada.	0
ClaimBuster	18779				All of which was opposed by my opponent.	1
ClaimBuster	18780				And it's blocked by the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	18781				Well, the matter of judgment is very important.	0
ClaimBuster	18782				If that isn't a liberal idea, I've never heard one.	0
ClaimBuster	18783				I'm glad to hear tonight that he does suggest that I have had some experience.	0
ClaimBuster	18784				We need to have an active and aggressive action on the part of the president, the leader of his country, to seek out every possible way to get that information which has kept the MIA families in despair and doubt, and Mr. Ford has just not done it.	1
ClaimBuster	18785				They do not pay us.	1
ClaimBuster	18786				But let's look at the other side of the coin.	0
ClaimBuster	18787				And you talk about cutting benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	18788				When we talk about preconditions -- and Henry Kissinger did say we should have contacts without preconditions -- the idea is that we do not expect to solve every problem before we initiate talks.	0
ClaimBuster	18789				That creates about 4 million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	18790				And we've got to do several things at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	18791				We've got to pay it off and build money to renew it- -spend money to renew it, and that's going to take a growing, expanding job base.	0
ClaimBuster	18792				America's going to have that kind of leadership and continue to promote principles of peace to make a world a safer place and make people in this country more confident that their future is secure.	0
ClaimBuster	18793				More land being restored since I've been the president.	1
ClaimBuster	18794				And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it.	0
ClaimBuster	18795				I do not believe that this Administration has implemented those bills which represent the will of the majority of the Congress on two occasions with vigor.	1
ClaimBuster	18796				I don't believe there's any burden, or any responsibility, that any American would not assume to protect his country, to protect our security, to advance the cause of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	18797				And one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely -- because if you read this article, there's no doubt.	1
ClaimBuster	18798				Over 150,000 Americans have died of AIDS.	1
ClaimBuster	18799				It's only on yellow here.	1
ClaimBuster	18800				I'm saying, well, this is not as tough as World War II and it's not as tough as the revolution.	0
ClaimBuster	18801				That's exactly the philosophy that we've seen in place for the last decade.	1
ClaimBuster	18802				With the Arab Spring, came a great deal of hope that there would be a change towards more moderation, and opportunity for greater participation on the part of women in public life, and in economic life in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	18803				Do you want to go first?	0
ClaimBuster	18804				I thought there was some exaggerations about the numbers.	0
ClaimBuster	18805				And so when you're running up the taxes like that, you're taxing job creators, and that's not how you keep jobs here.	0
ClaimBuster	18806				We have increased funding for AIDS.	1
ClaimBuster	18807				I want to change it.	0
ClaimBuster	18808				I want to lead a unified country.	0
ClaimBuster	18809				He's now down to a figure of five to seven billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	18810				Tonight you√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢re going to hear that my passion and my vision is to empower Americans to be able to make decisions for themselves in their own lives.	0
ClaimBuster	18811				Not willing to give up the need to do it but there may be individual components that we can't do.	0
ClaimBuster	18812				They put a plan out.	0
ClaimBuster	18813				I will not cut the benefits.	0
ClaimBuster	18814				This is a - a typical attitude that really causes havoc in people's lives, and then it's covered over by saying that our country has naturally got a 6 percent unemployment rate, or 7 percent unemployment rate and a 6 percent inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	18815				Some of my fellow governors who are real heroes to me.	0
ClaimBuster	18816				We should not uh - force our Nationalist allies to get off of them and give them to the Communists.	0
ClaimBuster	18817				Latin America is a huge opportunity for us -- time zone, language opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	18818				Look at the record of the man running for the president.	0
ClaimBuster	18819				Their Hippocratic Oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books.	1
ClaimBuster	18820				(Laughter, boos) That's my five seconds.	0
ClaimBuster	18821				I don't believe that it's in the best interest of the United States and the NATO nations to have a Communist government in NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	18822				I want to invest in our children.	0
ClaimBuster	18823				What you just heard Governor Romney said is he doesn't have different ideas.	0
ClaimBuster	18824				Look at our surgeon general, Dr. Novello.	0
ClaimBuster	18825				But the president mentioned the auto industry and that somehow I would be in favor of jobs being elsewhere.	1
ClaimBuster	18826				That's one that I haven't...	0
ClaimBuster	18827				I have a plan that will help us go out and kill and find the terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	18828				We should have -- wait one second.	0
ClaimBuster	18829				I was hoping diplomacy would work.	0
ClaimBuster	18830				We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels.	1
ClaimBuster	18831				And I favor a shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether.	0
ClaimBuster	18832				They said, let us win.	1
ClaimBuster	18833				It's not, and let me explain the difference.	0
ClaimBuster	18834				No, Bob, regrettably, we have not moved far enough along.	0
ClaimBuster	18835				The world is safer without Saddam Hussein.	0
ClaimBuster	18836				And now that the energy prices are high, I guess he's not advocating those big energy taxes right now.	1
ClaimBuster	18837				I think the American people should be the judge of that.	0
ClaimBuster	18838				And therefore, they shouldn't be treated lightly.	0
ClaimBuster	18839				We don't know what the status of the dear leader's health is today, but we know this, that the North Koreans have broken every agreement that they've entered into.	1
ClaimBuster	18840				I have great respect for women.	0
ClaimBuster	18841				I believe that we must use clean, safe nuclear power.	0
ClaimBuster	18842				The laws regarding that always were State laws.	1
ClaimBuster	18843				This is the kind of thing that would have been discussed and thoroughly evaluated well before that kind of --	0
ClaimBuster	18844				They made a breakthrough in missiles, and by nineteen sixty-one, two, and three, they will be outnumbering us in missiles.	1
ClaimBuster	18845				I suggest, in the sense of taking responsibility for your actions, we lay those papers on the table.	0
ClaimBuster	18846				I think it's the attitude.	0
ClaimBuster	18847				It's an important priority, because now is the time to act and we're going to say to our seniors, our promises we've made to you will be promises kept.	0
ClaimBuster	18848				And I made some tough decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	18849				You said that, first, we should not have a timeline in Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	18850				We got to be right 100 percent of the time here at home, and they got to be right once.	0
ClaimBuster	18851				A president should never promise more than he can deliver and a president should always deliver everything that he's promised.	0
ClaimBuster	18852				But we didn't need to rush to war without a plan to win the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	18853				I noted, for example, in reading a - uh - a - a particular discussion that Senator Kennedy had with Dave Garroway shortly after the uh - his statement about regrets, that uh - he made the statement that he felt that these particular flights uh - were ones that shouldn't have occurred right at that time, and the indication was how would Mr. Khrushchev had felt if we had uh - had a flight over the uni- how would we have felt if Mr. Khrushchev ha - uh - had a flight over the United States while uh - he was visiting here.	1
ClaimBuster	18854				There is something else about Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	18855				Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses.	0
ClaimBuster	18856				But 32 of those have given up and canceled their plans to build, and again, because Government regulations and permits, and so forth, take - make it take - more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant in the United States as it does to build one in Japan or in Western Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	18857				And what's happened over the last four years has been very, very hard for America's young people.	0
ClaimBuster	18858				They spend too much money on themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	18859				Mr. Moyers, I'm not here to debate Governor Reagan's record as Governor.	0
ClaimBuster	18860				I won't ask you, but if you do, you're in the top 1%.	0
ClaimBuster	18861				This is the administration that fought regulatory reform that is putting a lot of small businessmen and small businesswomen out of business.	1
ClaimBuster	18862				Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective.	1
ClaimBuster	18863				Well, I don't think I ran the ad.	0
ClaimBuster	18864				I uh - said that I've served this country for fourteen years.	1
ClaimBuster	18865				So from your business, helping in buying a first-time home, exempting the capital gains on the sale of the home would be the most important things that you asked about.	0
ClaimBuster	18866				But it's not good enough.	0
ClaimBuster	18867				It has to have options for loans to failing businesses, rather than the government taking over those loans.	0
ClaimBuster	18868				We've got to do something about it.	0
ClaimBuster	18869				Well, I would suggest, Mr. Vanocur, that uh - if you know the President, that was probably a facetious remark.	0
ClaimBuster	18870				We're going into debt an additional $1 billion, little more than $1 billion every working day of the year.	1
ClaimBuster	18871				We just have a different point of view.	0
ClaimBuster	18872				I have spent the last quarter century fighting for middle-class working men and women in the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	18873				And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	18874				That's why I brought the leaders to Washington a few days ago.	1
ClaimBuster	18875				I prepared to be president.	0
ClaimBuster	18876				Yeah, I'm not in favor of new pieces of legislation on -- on guns and taking guns away or making certain guns illegal.	0
ClaimBuster	18877				We'll also make sure that we have trade relations with China that work for us.	0
ClaimBuster	18878				In the Congress, in the House of Representatives, I served on the House Intelligence Committee and I worked hard to learn the subject of nuclear arms control and how we can diffuse these tensions and deal with non-proliferation and deal with the problems of terrorism and these new weapons of mass destruction.	1
ClaimBuster	18879				It's like a huge tax gap.	0
ClaimBuster	18880				But as a President of the United States, when somebody asks you about pardons, you say no comment, period.	0
ClaimBuster	18881				But what does he offer?	0
ClaimBuster	18882				He hasn't had a tough cross-examination-type press conference in over thirty days.	1
ClaimBuster	18883				That's a whole other subject, but I see we still have a little bit more time.	0
ClaimBuster	18884				And one is going to give you $122 more if you happen to be in that range of about a $20,000-a-year income.	1
ClaimBuster	18885				This country doesn't have to be in the shape that it is in.	0
ClaimBuster	18886				Mr. Harriman talked to the leaders in Yugoslavia, and I think it's accurate to say that there is no uh - prospect in their opinion, of the Soviet Union invading uh - Yugoslavia should uh - Mr. Tito pass away.	1
ClaimBuster	18887				That is not how we grow the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	18888				I think what I'd like to talk about a minute, since you're asking the question, is the General Motors issue.	0
ClaimBuster	18889				And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information.	0
ClaimBuster	18890				Take a look at Libya.	0
ClaimBuster	18891				It's cost us billions and billions of dollars for peace-keeping operations.	1
ClaimBuster	18892				It's growing more slowly this year than last year, and more slowly last year than the year before.	1
ClaimBuster	18893				I think of a young man now in this country named Villadaris, who was released from a Cuban jail.	1
ClaimBuster	18894				Now, as to my closing remarks: I've always believed that this land was placed here between the two great oceans by some divine plan.	0
ClaimBuster	18895				Well, you know, when I talked about the $87 billion, I made a mistake in how I talk about the war.	1
ClaimBuster	18896				The ones that are out there are doing well.	0
ClaimBuster	18897				And that would be a severe blow to our abilities there in the Pacific.	0
ClaimBuster	18898				We believe that we can uh do a better job in the area of crime, but that requires a tougher sentencing, mandatory certain prison sentences for those who violate our criminal laws.	0
ClaimBuster	18899				And what I'm looking for is who did it?	0
ClaimBuster	18900				They're going to do a tremendous job.	0
ClaimBuster	18901				I'll just have to tell Mr. Morton that.	0
ClaimBuster	18902				And I think we're both very lucky.	0
ClaimBuster	18903				We don't know what a qualified mortgage is yet.	0
ClaimBuster	18904				And I think those that advocated the freeze missed the point that there was a better way and that better way has resulted in a principle asymmetrical cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	18905				And believe me there are a lot of old boys in the K.G.B.	0
ClaimBuster	18906				They left the planning of the State Department in the State Department desks.	1
ClaimBuster	18907				And I'm happy to say that we've gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission.	1
ClaimBuster	18908				But it seemed to me just as an observer that you know before you'd call somebody to America, you'd have some notion what the end result might be.	0
ClaimBuster	18909				Today you've got problems in Europe, still bubbling along even though Europe's gone democracy's route.	0
ClaimBuster	18910				And I also know in a free society people, consenting adults can live the way they want to live.	1
ClaimBuster	18911				But we just have a different set of convictions about how you make America safe.	0
ClaimBuster	18912				Some of the healthy folks, healthy young kids say I'll never get sick, therefore I don't need health care right now.	0
ClaimBuster	18913				We've got to collect the taxes to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	18914				We also raised the amount of each Pell Grant.	1
ClaimBuster	18915				And the answer is to discipline both the executive branch and the congressional branch by holding the line on taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	18916				This we must get across to the world.	0
ClaimBuster	18917				And we're going to lead the way out of this economic recession across this world and economic slowdown here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	18918				We can store and reprocess spent nuclear fuel, Senator Obama, no problem.	0
ClaimBuster	18919				And Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.	1
ClaimBuster	18920				We're going to give a better prescription program.	0
ClaimBuster	18921				Prime Minister Rabin gave his life believing that that trust could be materialized, and I still think it can be.	0
ClaimBuster	18922				And here is where my opponent and I differ.	0
ClaimBuster	18923				But there are opportunities there now.	0
ClaimBuster	18924				We worked very closely with the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Great Britain, who have been the folks delivering the message to the mullahs that if you expect to be part of the world of nations, get rid of your nuclear programs.	1
ClaimBuster	18925				Senator Obama talks about the budgets I voted for.	1
ClaimBuster	18926				Some of the restrictions that have been placed by the Congress in the last couple of years.	1
ClaimBuster	18927				There's a fundamentally different vision about how we move our country forward.	0
ClaimBuster	18928				I talked to all of them to find out how serious they were about really holding Saddam Hussein accountable.	1
ClaimBuster	18929				You can look at me.	0
ClaimBuster	18930				Right now, in the United States of America, business pays the second-highest business taxes in the world, 35 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	18931				And the whole controversy about land missiles came up because we thought that the strategic nuclear weapons, the most destabilizing are the land-based.	0
ClaimBuster	18932				There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	18933				And as I pointed out in 1952, I made it very clear that as far as the Korean War was concerned, that I felt that the decision to go into the war in Korea was right and necessary.	1
ClaimBuster	18934				He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.	0
ClaimBuster	18935				I can't say it any more plainly.	0
ClaimBuster	18936				That saves manpower, and it saves equipment.	0
ClaimBuster	18937				In many instances we've made agreements, like in Vietnam, uh - that have uh - been revealed later on to our uh - embarrassment.	1
ClaimBuster	18938				And there is a connection.	0
ClaimBuster	18939				All of a sudden, they're starting to pay up.	1
ClaimBuster	18940				I can't find a job.	0
ClaimBuster	18941				And the American worker is the most productive, the most innovative.	1
ClaimBuster	18942				Uhh - I have recommended to the Congress, however - I'm sure you're familiar with this - legislation that would uhh - make it uhh - very uhh - proper in - in the right way, that the attorney general could go in and get the right for wiretapping under security cases.	0
ClaimBuster	18943				I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score.	0
ClaimBuster	18944				In addition we uh - have to expand our research and development.	0
ClaimBuster	18945				In the Balkans we have allies, NATO, ready, willing and able to go and carry a big part of the burden.	1
ClaimBuster	18946				The last time the Vice President used that phrase, I suspect he remembers it, don't you?	0
ClaimBuster	18947				We can't put the Middle East peace process on our timetable.	0
ClaimBuster	18948				And we need to do all of the things that are necessary to make it more efficient.	0
ClaimBuster	18949				I want to give robust support to the groups that are trying to overthrow Saddam Hussein, and I know there are allegations that they're too weak to do it, but that's what they said about the forces that were opposing Milosevic in Serbia, and you know, the policy of enforcing sanctions against Serbia has just resulted in a spectacular victory for democracy just in the past week, and it seems to me that having taken so long to see the sanctions work there, building upon the policy of containment that was successful over a much longer period of time against the former Soviet Union in the communist block, seems a little early to declare that we should give up on the sanctions.	1
ClaimBuster	18950				We used to be there.	1
ClaimBuster	18951				Every single one of the Joint Chiefs will testify to the fact that readiness is in an historic high.	0
ClaimBuster	18952				So we have our differences.	0
ClaimBuster	18953				After 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it.	1
ClaimBuster	18954				That's going to be up to the people, isn't it?	1
ClaimBuster	18955				I'm going to change that.	0
ClaimBuster	18956				There's just no doubt in my mind we would rue the day, had Saddam Hussein been in power.	0
ClaimBuster	18957				And I'll tell you what.	0
ClaimBuster	18958				I think that -- well, I think that's part of the need for a cultural change.	0
ClaimBuster	18959				But maybe you meant that some in the country don't have the will to fight it, but those that are out there on the front line, as you know -- you've been a strong backer of law enforcement -- really -- I just want to clear that up --have the will to fight it, and, frankly, some of them are giving their lives.	1
ClaimBuster	18960				He's parsing words, my friends.	0
ClaimBuster	18961				And if you make less than $250,000, less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see one dime's worth of tax increase.	1
ClaimBuster	18962				And everybody says they take responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	18963				It doesn't work that way.	0
ClaimBuster	18964				I'm spending my money -- not PAC money, not foreign money, my money -- to take this message to the people.	1
ClaimBuster	18965				Now the bill that the President had submitted would have provided more aid for those areas that really need it - areas like Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and the areas of West Virginia - than the ones that Senator Kennedy was supporting.	1
ClaimBuster	18966				It does involve going after them online.	0
ClaimBuster	18967				And there is a difference principle -	0
ClaimBuster	18968				What's relevant here is that tool, that discipline, that he has to live by in Arkansas, and I'd like it for the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	18969				Therefore, if we are on the mount, if we are rising, if our influence is spreading, if our prestige is spreading, then those uh - who stand now on the razor edge of decision between us or between the Communist system, wondering whether they should use the system of freedom to develop their countries or the system of Communism, they'll be persuaded to follow our example.	0
ClaimBuster	18970				We have to restore trust between communities and the police.	0
ClaimBuster	18971				This is a big question.	0
ClaimBuster	18972				The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, and we have worked hard to expand America's economic presence around the world with the biggest increase in trade with the largest new number of trade agreements in history And that's one of the reasons America is number one in auto production again.	1
ClaimBuster	18973				But we're opening the Old Post Office.	1
ClaimBuster	18974				And change for change sake isn't enough.	0
ClaimBuster	18975				So we've got to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	18976				Most of her donors have done the same thing as I do.	1
ClaimBuster	18977				I might even be willing to reduce to some degree our military emplacements in the Panama Canal Zane, but I would not relinquish practical control of the Panama Canal Zane any time in the foreseeable future.	0
ClaimBuster	18978				So their economy is in a shambles.	1
ClaimBuster	18979				That happened on this president's watch.	1
ClaimBuster	18980				Make sure your kids can go to college.	0
ClaimBuster	18981				But I do know, I do know that I oppose abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	18982				I want to be the president that gets conventional forces balance.	0
ClaimBuster	18983				So I believe that we should take a different approach to this and talk about how we stand on the issues instead of trying to characterize each other's motivations.	0
ClaimBuster	18984				Miss Loomis, I think it's very appropriate that the first question in this first debate of Campaign '80 should relate to the economy of the country, because it seems to me that the people who are watching us tonight - 221 million Americans - are truly concerned about the poor rate of performance of the American economy over the last four years.	1
ClaimBuster	18985				If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.	0
ClaimBuster	18986				Do not go to the extreme.	0
ClaimBuster	18987				You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn't afford.	0
ClaimBuster	18988				And I think we have enormous opportunity for trade.	0
ClaimBuster	18989				The programs that we've been trying where you control everything and mandate it from Washington don't work.	0
ClaimBuster	18990				Well, we can do what we did with Guatemala.	0
ClaimBuster	18991				We were faced with uh - heavy inflation, over 12 percent; we were faced with substantial unemployment.	1
ClaimBuster	18992				Uh - he had directed his uh - diplomatic relation - uh - uh - representative to yield to the Panamanians full sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone at the end of a certain period of time.	1
ClaimBuster	18993				We're going to have to develop better community transportation systems, so that with buses and light rail, we can replace the private automobile in those places where it clearly is not energy-efficient.	0
ClaimBuster	18994				I have talked of having zones in those cities that are run down, where there is a high percentage of people on welfare, and offer tax incentives.	1
ClaimBuster	18995				Now, whose fault is that?	0
ClaimBuster	18996				It works when we make sure they've got housing, like we have done in the last military budgets.	1
ClaimBuster	18997				Even the Republican platform has criticized the lack of leadership in Mr. Ford and they've criticized the foreign policy of this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	18998				This is one of the most important priorities that faces this country.	0
ClaimBuster	18999				Coast Guard cutters tied up at the dock this summer, not patrolling.	1
ClaimBuster	19000				There were too many infantrymen there, not enough heavy artillery; and certainly I don't think there was any implication in Secretary Dulles' statement that Quemoy and Matsu should not be defended in the event that they were attacked, and that attack was a preliminary to an attack on Formosa.	1
ClaimBuster	19001				of a crime a serious criminal offense, and that person is prosecuted, then, in my opinion, we are going after the person who uses the gun for the wrong reason.	0
ClaimBuster	19002				It's all happening in this administration because they cut funding and they cut interdiction.	1
ClaimBuster	19003				In the Medicare reform I talk about it says if you are a senior, you can stay in Medicare if you like it, and that's fine, but we're going to give you other choices to choose if you want to do so, just like they do the federal employees.	1
ClaimBuster	19004				But I favor public school choice, and I favor radical decentralization in giving more power to better-trained principals and teachers with parent councils to control their schools.	0
ClaimBuster	19005				Therefore I support the Brady bill which would impose a national waiting period unless and until a state did what only Virginia has done now, which is to automate its records.	1
ClaimBuster	19006				The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	19007				We feel that there must be a continued obligation to the people, the some nineteen or twenty million people in Taiwan.	0
ClaimBuster	19008				We need to have accountability.	0
ClaimBuster	19009				Because we've got -- we have presided over the largest increase -- we've got to have a new direction for this country.	0
ClaimBuster	19010				So mandatory conservation measures - yes.	0
ClaimBuster	19011				They've been prepared to defend.	1
ClaimBuster	19012				But I will promise you this with all the confidence in my heart and in the world, that I will do my best if I'm elected president, I'll work my heart out to get the big things right for the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	19013				We've been dormant too long.	0
ClaimBuster	19014				We're doing our duty to provide the funding.	0
ClaimBuster	19015				The president thinks it's more important to fight for that top 1 percent than to fight for fiscal responsibility and to fight for you.	0
ClaimBuster	19016				Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.	1
ClaimBuster	19017				That's the height of silliness...	0
ClaimBuster	19018				But Mr. Mondale seems to approve MAD -- MAD is mutual assured destruction -- meaning, if you use nuclear weapons on us, the only thing we have to keep you from doing it is that we'll kill as many people of yours as you'll kill of ours.	1
ClaimBuster	19019				We paid more military aid, more aid into Laos po- per - per person than in any country in the world and we ought to know now that Laos is moving from neutralism in the direction of the Communists.	1
ClaimBuster	19020				And as far as what Mr. Bush says, he is the person who raised taxes on the middle class after saying he wouldn't.	1
ClaimBuster	19021				Ladies and gentlemen, the president just didn't level with you right now again.	0
ClaimBuster	19022				Get the economy going, cut the capital gains rate, create more jobs and opportunities for everybody in America.	0
ClaimBuster	19023				That's what the American worker wants.	0
ClaimBuster	19024				And as we become a diverse society, we're going to have to deal with it more and more.	0
ClaimBuster	19025				First uh - let me again try to correct the record on the matter of Quemoy and Matsu.	0
ClaimBuster	19026				And I think what we have to do is convince people there is a big difference, if you vote one way you will have a Department of Education in the 21st century, if you vote the other way, you won't.	0
ClaimBuster	19027				Now, the president has never explained to America, ever, hasn't done it tonight, where does the transitional money, that $2 trillion, come from?	1
ClaimBuster	19028				I would like to have had a big, organized summit, but those people were killing each other, rapidly, innocent Arab children, innocent Israeli people, they were dying.	1
ClaimBuster	19029				But I think it's really an important issue.	0
ClaimBuster	19030				We have to do a lot of things.	0
ClaimBuster	19031				I think it's time to have a truce.	0
ClaimBuster	19032				Now, on the subject of free trade agreements.	0
ClaimBuster	19033				I've supported Headstart, I think we ought to look at it.	1
ClaimBuster	19034				Let's come back to what the president was speaking about, which is what's happening in the world and the president's statement that things are going so well.	0
ClaimBuster	19035				I think we need to have clean coal technologies.	0
ClaimBuster	19036				She and her husband made us grandparents almost a year-and-a-half ago, and yet if she'll forgive me, when she was little, she brought a record home that had some awful lyrics in it and Tipper hit the ceiling.	1
ClaimBuster	19037				Well, let me thank everybody here at the University and, Jim, thank you.	0
ClaimBuster	19038				You got two years to look for a job.	1
ClaimBuster	19039				And that's going to be particularly important in dealing not only with situations such as now occurring in Israel, but with Saddam Hussein.	0
ClaimBuster	19040				If we can get that right, then we can move in a direction not only of energy independence, but we can create 5 million new jobs all across America, including in the heartland where we can retool some of these plants to make these highly fuel-efficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels, the kinds of clean energy approaches that should be the driver of our economy for the next century.	0
ClaimBuster	19041				But perhaps the best way to keep jobs here in America and to keep this economy growing is to make sure our education system works.	0
ClaimBuster	19042				James Lee Witt of FEMA has done a really good job of working with governors during times of crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	19043				If I were dealing with politics here, the polls show the American people want this.	0
ClaimBuster	19044				And I'm not going to run up taxes, which will cost this economy jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	19045				The governor was for a nuclear freeze that would have locked in a thousand Soviet intermediate nuclear force weapons and zero for the West.	1
ClaimBuster	19046				And I'm frankly surprised you didn't pay more attention to that example.	0
ClaimBuster	19047				No, of course I haven't talked to Prime Minister Macmillan.	1
ClaimBuster	19048				We've got to put more money into preventive care.	0
ClaimBuster	19049				I said, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed with me, that it was time for us to turn our research ability to seeing if we could not find this kind of defensive weapon.	1
ClaimBuster	19050				If America shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy.	0
ClaimBuster	19051				A recent study has shown the people in the middle-class will see $4,000.00 per year in higher taxes as a result of the spending and borrowing of this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	19052				Secondly, any lasting peace is going to have to be a peace that's good for both sides.	0
ClaimBuster	19053				That's not the way we cut -- we'll cut out all the pork.	0
ClaimBuster	19054				Well, Warren would be a pretty good choice -- Warren Buffett, and I'm pleased to have his support.	0
ClaimBuster	19055				And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over.	0
ClaimBuster	19056				We have to help people succeed at home and at work.	0
ClaimBuster	19057				That's why I want a tax cut for education and child rearing, but it's got to be paid for.	0
ClaimBuster	19058				I believe that we have a great interest in the Pacific Basin.	0
ClaimBuster	19059				Right now we have a flat to deteriorating job base and where it appears to be growing, it's minimum-wage jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	19060				But I'd say, if you had to separate out, I think it's experience at this level.	0
ClaimBuster	19061				You pick your own doctor, and nobody can take that away from you.	0
ClaimBuster	19062				And so as a consequence, they're paying their premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they don't have enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance companies say that they've hit the limit.	0
ClaimBuster	19063				Now, I'm going to tell you what I really think is going to happen over time is technology is going to change the way we live for the good for the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	19064				But he wasn't in the Senate with Senator Feingold.	1
ClaimBuster	19065				We have to be able to compete in the world market.	0
ClaimBuster	19066				It's -- you've got to be consistent when you're the president.	0
ClaimBuster	19067				Restore fiscal discipline, we'll do a lot better.	0
ClaimBuster	19068				That has been where all our resources have gone.	1
ClaimBuster	19069				And drilling offshore and nuclear power are two vital elements of that.	0
ClaimBuster	19070				And the way to do that is first to recruit more teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	19071				I'm going to shut that program down, and we're going to make it clear to the world we're serious about containing nuclear proliferation.	0
ClaimBuster	19072				We are a rising nation.	1
ClaimBuster	19073				Will we have a government of secrecy that excludes the American people from participation in making basic decisions and therefore covers up mistakes and makes it possible for our government - our government - to depart from the principles of our Constitution and Bill of Rights?	0
ClaimBuster	19074				But he's talking tough medicine, and I think that's good.	0
ClaimBuster	19075				And sometimes you can't go it alone.	0
ClaimBuster	19076				And I got a long history of doing that.	1
ClaimBuster	19077				He would do for the US what he's done to Arkansas.	0
ClaimBuster	19078				There are 100,000 troops trained, police, guard, special units, border patrol.	1
ClaimBuster	19079				That is why I say that in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area.	0
ClaimBuster	19080				I have gone to church regularly all my life, and I started to here in Washington.	1
ClaimBuster	19081				I want to do something about that.	0
ClaimBuster	19082				This would not be done just on the first day.	0
ClaimBuster	19083				Well, I think we have to go to work on the problem of Third World debt and we've got to assist those Third World countries in dealing with this massive debt which they currently-which they have incurred and which is burdening them and which if we don't do something about it and assist them along with other nations around the world, we'll destroy their economies, destroy their future.	0
ClaimBuster	19084				Then the other day he says he's for it, however then we've got to pass other legislation.	1
ClaimBuster	19085				I have a realistic approach to trade.	0
ClaimBuster	19086				We're using every asset at our disposal to get Osama bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	19087				Secretary Kissinger, in his meeting with uh - Prime Minister Smith of Rhodesia, was able to convince him that it was in the best interests of whites as well as blacks in Rhodesia to find an answer for a transitional government and then a majority government.	1
ClaimBuster	19088				Well, I don't know about all these percentages that he throws out, but I do know that -- I speculate that the reason why he didn't answer your question directly as to whether my numbers were right, the facts were right about Texas ranking dead last in families with health insurance and 49th out of 50 for both children and women, is because those facts are correct.	1
ClaimBuster	19089				The world is better off without Saddam Hussein.	0
ClaimBuster	19090				When the Vice President makes a decision, that will be his decision.	0
ClaimBuster	19091				I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable.	1
ClaimBuster	19092				I've already put forward things that'll get this country working fast, some of which have been echoed here tonight--investment tax allowance, capital gains reduction, more on research and development, tax credit for first-time home buyers.	0
ClaimBuster	19093				Jim, one of the issues that I would like to close with in my statement is education, because it's an example of the overall approach that I think is important.	0
ClaimBuster	19094				He's got over $100 billion of tax cuts and incentives.	1
ClaimBuster	19095				Now, you can say that that's OK and Hillary can say that that's OK.	0
ClaimBuster	19096				First, I'd like to thank the commission and my opponents for participating in these debates and making them possible.	0
ClaimBuster	19097				But, in fact, these last 4 years have seen more weapons built, a wider and more vigorous arms race than in human history.	1
ClaimBuster	19098				If you don't grow the economy you can't get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	19099				Let me take just a minute to comment on something that Governor Carter said.	0
ClaimBuster	19100				So under these circumstances, I, therefore, strongly urge and I will strongly hold, if I have the opportunity to urge or to hold - this position: that any summit conference would be gone into only after the most careful preparation and only after Mr. Khrushchev - after his disgraceful conduct at Paris, after his disgraceful conduct at the United Nations - gave some assurance that he really wanted to sit down and talk and to accomplish something and not just to make propaganda.	0
ClaimBuster	19101				1 percent of Americans is the highest it's been since 1928.	1
ClaimBuster	19102				It would cost something like a trillion dollars to test and deploy weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	19103				Now, Senator Obama didn't mention that, along with his tax cuts, he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs.	1
ClaimBuster	19104				This means through tax reform and if necessary tax cuts that will stimulate more jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	19105				And I think Congressman Lewis' point was that we have to be careful about how we deal with our supporters.	0
ClaimBuster	19106				When you get on an airplane, your bag is X- rayed, but the cargo hold isn't X-rayed.	1
ClaimBuster	19107				I think we have to make the right and responsible choices.	0
ClaimBuster	19108				One of the good things we've gone in Texas is we have strong accountability because you can't cure unless you know.	0
ClaimBuster	19109				You said by now we'd be at 5.4 percent unemployment.	1
ClaimBuster	19110				That we are, indeed, an energy-rich nation.	1
ClaimBuster	19111				I'm going to bring them together.	0
ClaimBuster	19112				How stupid is our country?	0
ClaimBuster	19113				But we did so in a careful, thoughtful way, making certain that we knew who we were dealing with, that those forces of moderation on the ground were ones that we could work with, and we have to take the same kind of steady, thoughtful leadership when it comes to Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	19114				That is hardly throwing away a treaty and being opposed to arms limitation.	0
ClaimBuster	19115				That's the way the game's played now.	0
ClaimBuster	19116				But if you're a president, it's not.	0
ClaimBuster	19117				And anybody who thinks I'm just saying it, it will be the first bill I send to the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	19118				So we have to do two things, as I said.	0
ClaimBuster	19119				As I've seen abortions sometimes used as a birth control device, for heavens sakes.	1
ClaimBuster	19120				Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites.	0
ClaimBuster	19121				She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.	0
ClaimBuster	19122				So, we can fix this system in a comprehensive way.	0
ClaimBuster	19123				We ought to have a strategy that will build the economic and industrial base.	0
ClaimBuster	19124				He is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40-plus years who has not released his tax returns, so everything he says about charity or anything else, we can't prove it.	1
ClaimBuster	19125				I think our troops ought to be used to help overthrow the dictator when it's in our best interests.	0
ClaimBuster	19126				This is a very important topic and it's a very sensitive topic, because a lot of good people disagree on the issue.	1
ClaimBuster	19127				...the choice in this election is going to be whose promises are going to be more likely to help you in your life?	0
ClaimBuster	19128				I want to thank Governor Romney and the University of Denver for your hospitality.	0
ClaimBuster	19129				I'd like to understand who it was that did this, what the idea was behind it, why it led to the violence, thousands of guns going to Mexican drug lords.	1
ClaimBuster	19130				That was facilitated in part because we had ended the war in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	19131				More soldiers killed in June than before.	1
ClaimBuster	19132				I selected him because of his outstanding record as a Circuit Court of Appeals Judge, and I was very pleased that uh - an overwhelming Democratic United States Senate, after going into his background, came to the conclusion that he was uh - fit and should serve, and the vote in his behalf was overwhelming.	0
ClaimBuster	19133				So I will not grant amnesty to those who have come here illegally.	0
ClaimBuster	19134				I don't care if the idea comes from the other side or this side.	0
ClaimBuster	19135				And we are doing a better job of it.	0
ClaimBuster	19136				For 31/2 years, this administration avoided arms control, resisted tabling arms control proposals that had any hope of agreeing, rebuked their negotiator in 1981 when he came close to an agreement, at least in principle, on medium-range weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	19137				They went a long way toward reclaiming this election for the American people and taking their country back.	0
ClaimBuster	19138				Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs, and I know anytime we talk about entitlements, people become concerned that something's going to happen that's going to change their life for the worse.	0
ClaimBuster	19139				And, of course, Iraq is a central part in the war on terror.	0
ClaimBuster	19140				Mr. Greenspan I thought missed an opportunity to say there's a third way, and that is to get a better rate of return on the Social Security monies coming into the trust.	0
ClaimBuster	19141				I will not agree to any production restrictions -- or agreements, unless we have the ability to verify those agreements.	0
ClaimBuster	19142				Can I comment on that?	0
ClaimBuster	19143				It's balancing a budget by the year 2002.	0
ClaimBuster	19144				The present bureaucratic structure of the - of the Federal Government is a mess.	0
ClaimBuster	19145				And I'm going to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	19146				He said that he was the second most powerful man in Cuba.	1
ClaimBuster	19147				Are you working harder to put food on the table, feed your children.	0
ClaimBuster	19148				But I want to do things that haven't been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it.	0
ClaimBuster	19149				But if guilt is established, whoever is guilty we will treat with that situation then, and they will be removed.	0
ClaimBuster	19150				All of these things are presently being rectified, and I think that we are going to salvage the farmers.	0
ClaimBuster	19151				Well, we've had this discussion before.	1
ClaimBuster	19152				'Cause I'm going to bring rates down across the board for everybody, but I'm going to limit deductions and exemptions and credits, particularly for people at the high end, because I am not going to have people at the high end pay less than they're paying now.	0
ClaimBuster	19153				And I believe if we identify ourselves with that force, if we identify ourselves with it as Lincoln, as Wilson did, as Franklin Roosevelt did, if we become known as the friend of freedom, sustaining freedom, helping freedom, helping these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease, helping them build their lives, I believe in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, eventually in the Eastern Europe and the Middle East, certainly in Western Europe, we can strengthen freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	19154				Let's give every American a choice: two tax brackets, generous dividends, and, two -- and let Americans choose whether they want the -- the existing tax code or they want a new tax code.	0
ClaimBuster	19155				We have seen him insult women.	1
ClaimBuster	19156				But I've made a different bet on American workers.	0
ClaimBuster	19157				We're going to do that with an economic package.	0
ClaimBuster	19158				90 percent reductions in lead since I chaired that regulatory task force; 90 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	19159				So I gave four or five specific examples to the Congress and said, prove to me that these people could recover but we're going to eliminate frivolous lawsuits, I'll sign the bill.	1
ClaimBuster	19160				I do not think that they are.	0
ClaimBuster	19161				To the best of my knowledge he's never once suggested that a session of the Senate begin with the Pledge of Allegiance.	1
ClaimBuster	19162				"O'Neill said, ""Come on over."	1
ClaimBuster	19163				That is priority one in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	19164				The sanctions are being violated.	1
ClaimBuster	19165				The freeze people were wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	19166				The -- the fact that he only has to pay 14 percent on his taxes when a lot of you are paying much higher.	1
ClaimBuster	19167				We spent $300 billion a year defending the world.	1
ClaimBuster	19168				I want to have a strong hand when it comes to the United States in world affairs.	0
ClaimBuster	19169				Let me just give you some examples.	0
ClaimBuster	19170				It wasn't created as a welfare program.	1
ClaimBuster	19171				So when genocide is happening, when ethnic cleansing is happening somewhere around the world and we stand idly by, that diminishes us.	0
ClaimBuster	19172				If you had a line item veto you could knock out the pork.	0
ClaimBuster	19173				We guard those like the secrets of the atomic bomb, literally.	1
ClaimBuster	19174				I want to remind people listening tonight that a plan is not a litany of complaints, and a plan is not to lay out programs that you can't pay for.	0
ClaimBuster	19175				Let me just make this comment.	0
ClaimBuster	19176				We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth.	1
ClaimBuster	19177				I told the NRA that's history.	1
ClaimBuster	19178				There are some programs that are very important that are under funded.	0
ClaimBuster	19179				The record just doesn't prove that such legislation or action by a local city council is effective.	1
ClaimBuster	19180				Well, we are the ones who found those.	0
ClaimBuster	19181				In 1983, as a result of these tax preferences, he paid a little over 12 percent, 12.8 percent in taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	19182				I talked in New Orleans about a gentler and kinder nation and I have made specific proposals on education and the environment and on ethics and energy and how we do better in battling crime in our country.	1
ClaimBuster	19183				In 1980 -- or 1979, a person with a fixed income of $8,000 was $500 above the poverty line, and this maybe explains why there are the numbers still in poverty.	1
ClaimBuster	19184				Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed.	1
ClaimBuster	19185				I don't know the answer to when life begins.	0
ClaimBuster	19186				And I will not have -- I will not stand for a tax increase on small business income.	0
ClaimBuster	19187				Our goal should be, in 10 year's time, we are free of dependence on Middle Eastern oil.	0
ClaimBuster	19188				I want to continue to work after we get this NAFTA agreement ratified this coming year.	0
ClaimBuster	19189				This is a serious business.	0
ClaimBuster	19190				This has not been Mr. Oil, or Mr. Gas, or Mr. Coal.	0
ClaimBuster	19191				It had 26 separate maps they had to sign, literally thousands of delineations of who would do what on the West Bank, and I believe if the parties will get together and in a good-faith manner make that agreement, that they'll be able to do it if we cannot impose a peace on the Middle East.	1
ClaimBuster	19192				When I go one second over, it's like a big deal.	0
ClaimBuster	19193				I think we've got to have welfare reform taken to the next stage.	0
ClaimBuster	19194				My own view, by the way, is I've added to that.	0
ClaimBuster	19195				But I tell you, those workers don't feel that way.	0
ClaimBuster	19196				And that plan is to make sure that folks at the top play by a different set of rules.	0
ClaimBuster	19197				I fully understand the threat.	0
ClaimBuster	19198				But the problem of population growth is one, here, with regard to our immigration.	0
ClaimBuster	19199				You know, I suspect that, on Social Security, we've got a somewhat similar position.	0
ClaimBuster	19200				That's why we have to continue to be alert.	0
ClaimBuster	19201				People have been -- their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you've done.	0
ClaimBuster	19202				I ask you for your help.	0
ClaimBuster	19203				And that's something that I'm committed to doing as president.	0
ClaimBuster	19204				And I have put forward a many-point drug program that includes what I would do as president of the United States; in terms of doing better on interdiction; and in terms of better in the neighborhoods.	0
ClaimBuster	19205				If I had to solve all the problems that face this country and I could be granted one wish as we started down the trail to rebuild the job base, the schools and so on and so forth, I would say a strong family unit in every home, where every child is loved, nurtured, and encouraged.	0
ClaimBuster	19206				I'll tell you exactly what I think can be done.	0
ClaimBuster	19207				On the fourth of July we had a wonderful two hundredth birthday - for our great country.	1
ClaimBuster	19208				These kinds of uh - procedures, along with evacuation procedures, adequate insurance, ought to be initiated.	0
ClaimBuster	19209				When you were asked about reduced class sizes, you said class sizes don't make a difference.	1
ClaimBuster	19210				Mr. Corddry, I am well aware of the present deficiencies in the Armed Forces of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	19211				And it's time for them to get serious on it.	0
ClaimBuster	19212				And the answer is neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	19213				We√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ll deal with our problems, we√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ll solve our problems.	0
ClaimBuster	19214				Because of previous agreements, their goods and products come into our country for free.	1
ClaimBuster	19215				And I'm a big proponent.	0
ClaimBuster	19216				It is going to be important for the president to be credible with Congress, important for the president to be credible with foreign nations.	0
ClaimBuster	19217				He voted 98 times to raise taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	19218				And those are the standards that I will use in nominating people to the Supreme Court of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	19219				I think you've apologized for it.	1
ClaimBuster	19220				Medicare is not getting less expensive; medical care for the elderly is getting more expensive, with greater deductibles, with fewer benefits, the kinds of things we've had under this Administration that have cut and chopped and reduced the kind of benefits that one gets under Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	19221				We shouldn't discriminate -- race, color, whatever -- life-style, disability.	0
ClaimBuster	19222				They went to Austin High School.	1
ClaimBuster	19223				Their policies so far, it seems to me, are pretty sound.	0
ClaimBuster	19224				So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact-checker.	1
ClaimBuster	19225				So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem.	1
ClaimBuster	19226				Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit.	0
ClaimBuster	19227				Look, we must improve education in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	19228				We have a government that doesn't work.	0
ClaimBuster	19229				But what we also have been able to do is position ourselves so we can start rebuilding America, and that's what my plan does.	1
ClaimBuster	19230				But I have worked hard for things like the Family and Medical Leave Law, the Brady Bill, the assault weapons ban, the program to put 100,000 police on the street.	1
ClaimBuster	19231				It's time to do it because we have run up so much debt that time is no longer our friend.	0
ClaimBuster	19232				They look at Washington and see people pointing fingers and casting blame and saying one thing and doing another.	0
ClaimBuster	19233				You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916.	1
ClaimBuster	19234				I'm not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan.	0
ClaimBuster	19235				If we don't repeal and replace -- now, it's probably going to die of its own weight.	0
ClaimBuster	19236				We've got a broad-based coalition that goes beyond party because I am going to change this country and make it better, with the help of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	19237				I might say to Mr. Perot, I can understand why you might have missed it, because there's so much fascination with trivia, but I worked out a deal with Boris Yeltsin to eliminate, get rid of entirely, the most destabilizing weapons of all, the SS-18, the intercontinental ballistic missile.	1
ClaimBuster	19238				By giving parents the tools to protect their children against cultural pollution.	0
ClaimBuster	19239				And so we just have an honest difference of opinion: I support it and he doesn't.	1
ClaimBuster	19240				H. L. Mencken said that for every problem there's a simple answer.	0
ClaimBuster	19241				I thought there should have been more troops, but you know what?	0
ClaimBuster	19242				The Senate Budget Committee did a study of the vice president's expenditures.	1
ClaimBuster	19243				I remember the world with NATO, and the world of Point Four, and the world of the Marshall Plan, and the world of the Peace Corps.	0
ClaimBuster	19244				Senator Kennedy has been hitting that point over and over again.	1
ClaimBuster	19245				If all of the unemployed today were in a single line allowing two feet for each of them, that line would reach from New York City to Los Angeles, California.	1
ClaimBuster	19246				But he, like welfare reform, I'm going to sign it but I'm going to try to change it next year.	0
ClaimBuster	19247				I think it's important and I share it.	0
ClaimBuster	19248				This really gets down to the fundamental difference in our philosophies.	0
ClaimBuster	19249				We need to encourage business.	0
ClaimBuster	19250				And that's because we structured the plan so that six million additional American families pay no taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	19251				And what's happened with some of the legislation that's been passed during the president's term, you've seen regulation become excessive, and it's hurt -- it's hurt the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	19252				And with respect to our attitude about the Iranian revolution, I was very clear about the murderous activities that had taken place and that was contrary to international law and everything that civilized people stand for.	1
ClaimBuster	19253				Just want to make sure they're safe.	0
ClaimBuster	19254				In my opinion, as we deal with this deficit, people from about $70,000 a year on down have to be dealt with very, very carefully, because they are the ones who didn't get any relief the first time around.	1
ClaimBuster	19255				See, we've got a $4 trillion debt and only in America would you have $2.8 trillion of it or 70% of it financed 5 years or less.	1
ClaimBuster	19256				That's going to change when I'm president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	19257				But I believe that's not what the American people want, and when he said, when he said at the convention, ideology doesn't matter, just competence, he was moving away from his own record, from what his passion has been over the years.	1
ClaimBuster	19258				And we've got a choice.	0
ClaimBuster	19259				Now, the president wishes that I had changed my mind.	0
ClaimBuster	19260				There are an estimated several thousand fighters in Mosul.	1
ClaimBuster	19261				Now, it is true that my friend and supporter, Warren Buffett, for example, could afford to pay a little more in taxes in order...	1
ClaimBuster	19262				And I, as you know, pushed for the debate to include the 209 American citizens who were part of it in Richmond a few days ago.	1
ClaimBuster	19263				As I said, I've worked all my life when I was in the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	19264				We've been caught up in a global slowdown.	0
ClaimBuster	19265				But we need -- Lester, we need law and order.	0
ClaimBuster	19266				I never suggested that compulsory arbitration was the solution for national emergency disputes.	1
ClaimBuster	19267				We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don't have people that know what they're doing.	1
ClaimBuster	19268				I know you do it.	0
ClaimBuster	19269				When the change of government occurred in Israel, the people of Israel were saying we don't want to abandon the peace process.	1
ClaimBuster	19270				That's not wishy-washy, and that's what I'm fighting for, you.	0
ClaimBuster	19271				One of my proudest moments was signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, that says the government has got to bend over backwards before we interfere with religious practice.	0
ClaimBuster	19272				Can I say, if I could just say a word about a woman that you didn't ask about, but my mom passed away a couple years ago, just before I was deciding to run.	1
ClaimBuster	19273				I want to compare what we're doing with what our adversaries are doing, so that by the year 1970 the United States is ahead in education, in health, in building, in homes, in economic strength.	0
ClaimBuster	19274				I'm very proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	19275				There are fewer parents of school-age children as a percentage of the voting population and there is the largest generation of students ever.	1
ClaimBuster	19276				Some people don't like the fact that I stood up to say no, but I did.	0
ClaimBuster	19277				First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	19278				Let me give you one quick example.	0
ClaimBuster	19279				I would have my Secretary of the Treasury be in touch with the financial centers not only here, but at home.	0
ClaimBuster	19280				And we're not going to change their system, and they sure better not try to change ours.	0
ClaimBuster	19281				Trying to frighten people in the voting booth.	0
ClaimBuster	19282				Over the last 10 years we've created manufacturing jobs much more rapidly than the national average.	1
ClaimBuster	19283				Senator Obama said that would be provocative.	1
ClaimBuster	19284				I wouldn't have taken any of the alternatives.	0
ClaimBuster	19285				I'd like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece.	0
ClaimBuster	19286				And we need to make it stronger.	0
ClaimBuster	19287				Let's make sure this thing's as good as we all think it is at the end of the meeting.	0
ClaimBuster	19288				I feel pretty confident tonight, but not that confident.	0
ClaimBuster	19289				All the president needs to sustain his veto of any bill is one-third plus one in either the House or the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	19290				I would like for them to look you in the eye and tell you why they have people representing foreign countries working on their campaigns.	0
ClaimBuster	19291				I don't break my promises after the election, and I don't make new promises in an election year.	0
ClaimBuster	19292				But what we don't need is to have the president keeping us from taking advantage of oil, coal and gas.	0
ClaimBuster	19293				Then I got into the Texas War on Drugs program and the big-time drug dealers got all upset.	1
ClaimBuster	19294				You've got another life involved.	0
ClaimBuster	19295				Also, there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life.	0
ClaimBuster	19296				What we were formerly so proud of - the strength of our country, its uh - moral integrity, the representation in foreign affairs of what our people are, what our Constitution stands for, has been gone.	0
ClaimBuster	19297				I must say that forty-four percent and that Soviet country is causing us a good deal of trouble tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	19298				Making sure that we are controlling our own energy, but not only the energy of today, but also the energy of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	19299				It's something you might consider.	0
ClaimBuster	19300				And these are the policies I want to bring to the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	19301				And in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if we're going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that, let's look where some of the money's going.	1
ClaimBuster	19302				We need to do better in education.	0
ClaimBuster	19303				We have got to get health coverage for those who do not have it and we've got to improve the quality for those who do with a patient's bill of rights that's real and that works, the Dingle-Norwood bill, and we have got to fill in the gaps in coverage by finally bringing parity for the treatment of mental illness, because that's been left out.	0
ClaimBuster	19304				And you cannot change positions in this war on terror if you expect to win.	0
ClaimBuster	19305				It says to American working men and women that are thrown out of work for no fault of their own that they're going to have jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	19306				So Senator Obama, who has never traveled south of our border, opposes the Colombia Free Trade Agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	19307				You talk about mixed messages.	0
ClaimBuster	19308				But then when he moved against Kuwait, I said this will not stand.	1
ClaimBuster	19309				As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be.	0
ClaimBuster	19310				I left public life on June the 11th of this year.	1
ClaimBuster	19311				I didn't say I would bring troops out in six months.	1
ClaimBuster	19312				Now, let's go back to Saddam Hussein.	0
ClaimBuster	19313				That's why we need campaign finance reform.	0
ClaimBuster	19314				We can be better if we face our future, rejoice in our strengths, face our problems, and by solving them, build a better society for our children.	0
ClaimBuster	19315				My opponent says he has a plan; it sounds familiar, because it's called the Bush plan.	0
ClaimBuster	19316				I look on this as history.	0
ClaimBuster	19317				You say we were giving mortgages to people who weren't qualified.	1
ClaimBuster	19318				These next 2 weeks we will be going full steam ahead to make sure that you get a voice and that you get your country back.	0
ClaimBuster	19319				Millions of Americans saw the results of that conflict.	1
ClaimBuster	19320				And, yes, Senator Obama calls for more troops, but what he doesn't understand, it's got to be a new strategy, the same strategy that he condemned in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	19321				So let me just tell you very quickly, we're entitled because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges, and we do it.	1
ClaimBuster	19322				Who will get hurt if we lay those papers on the table?	0
ClaimBuster	19323				We know that he promised America that he was going to build this coalition.	1
ClaimBuster	19324				He's talking about his plan to keep jobs here.	1
ClaimBuster	19325				I'm a student of history as is Senator Kennedy, incidentally; and I have found that in the history of this country we've had many great presidents.	1
ClaimBuster	19326				So I do think we need to strengthen family.	0
ClaimBuster	19327				I've reached across the aisle.	1
ClaimBuster	19328				But I think that we have to examine every agency of government and find out those that are doing their job and keep them and find out those that aren't and eliminate them and we'll have to scrub every agency of government.	0
ClaimBuster	19329				It seems to me the president, whoever the president may be, this is one of his highest responsibilities.	0
ClaimBuster	19330				I think Ross is right and that we do need some more restrictions on lobbyists.	0
ClaimBuster	19331				And that is the result of this president taking his eye off of Osama bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	19332				You have to see it to believe it.	0
ClaimBuster	19333				I served on the Small Business Committee for a long time.	1
ClaimBuster	19334				The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe.	0
ClaimBuster	19335				Homeownership rate is at an all-time high in America.	1
ClaimBuster	19336				And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.	0
ClaimBuster	19337				The report was so bad.	0
ClaimBuster	19338				Zero, because as I said in our last debate and I'll repeat, John, I exempt small businesses from the requirement for large businesses that can afford to provide health care to their employees, but are not doing it.	1
ClaimBuster	19339				We don't know who the rebels are.	1
ClaimBuster	19340				He suggested that we aid distressed areas.	1
ClaimBuster	19341				Now, maybe that explains why he hasn't fully funded the VA and the VA hospital is having trouble and veterans are complaining.	0
ClaimBuster	19342				-- because we're going to get rid of them, and the Congress will be listening to the people.	0
ClaimBuster	19343				It's a state tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	19344				Well, we have Great Britain.	1
ClaimBuster	19345				We can't get anything done.	0
ClaimBuster	19346				He's a strong, courageous leader.	0
ClaimBuster	19347				I want to say just one thing now, Ross, in fairness.	0
ClaimBuster	19348				I want to go line by line through every item in the federal budget and eliminate programs that don't work and make sure that those that do work, work better and cheaper.	0
ClaimBuster	19349				I get a 10-point spot.	0
ClaimBuster	19350				I cannot be more precise than that, because until we see what Mr. Khrushchev does and what he says uh - we cannot indicate what our plans will be.	0
ClaimBuster	19351				Let's get together on this instant check because that will really make a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	19352				One thing I've called for that has been stymied, and I'll keep on working for it, is a whole financial reform legislation.	0
ClaimBuster	19353				It's time for our nation to come together and do what's right for the people, and I think this is right for the people.	0
ClaimBuster	19354				There's too much bitterness in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	19355				But we're not going to do it in that old Democratic, liberal way of trying to build more bricks and mortars.	0
ClaimBuster	19356				We've seen uh - in many instances in recent years a minority affairs uh - section of uh Small Loan Administration, uh - Small Business Administration lend uh - a black entrepreneur just enough money to get started, and then to go bankrupt.	1
ClaimBuster	19357				Now, if you don't want to really do that I'm not your man.	0
ClaimBuster	19358				It would save a lot of money through more managed care, by giving more options, more preventative care and lowering the inflation rate and the prices we're paying providers without having the kind of big premium increases and out-of-pocket costs that the budget I vetoed would provide.	0
ClaimBuster	19359				They see 900 FBI files, private person, being gathered up by somebody in the Whitehouse.	1
ClaimBuster	19360				I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they've left, that's why ISIS formed in the first place.	1
ClaimBuster	19361				But I've not made a judgment, and I have not narrowed down a list of three or four people, among whom would be the candidate.	0
ClaimBuster	19362				We are being murdered economically because we have too many drop-outs, we have too many low birthweight babies, we have too many drug addicts as kids, we have too much violence, we are too divided by race, by income, by region.	0
ClaimBuster	19363				And so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	19364				We can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor.	0
ClaimBuster	19365				I would suggest that after Premier Kush- Khrushchev's uh - performance in the United Nations, compared with President Eisenhower's eloquent speech, that at the present time Communist prestige in the world is at an all-time low and American prestige is at an all-time high.	0
ClaimBuster	19366				Getting us to a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	19367				They went to extraordinary sick lengths, and I just found it amusing that they would take 2 or 3 cases where I was involved in lawsuits and would engage an investigator -- the lawyers would engage an investigator, which is common.	1
ClaimBuster	19368				In addition, many of the countries around the world still keep restrictions against our goads, going all the way back to the days when there was a dollar shortage.	1
ClaimBuster	19369				If we stand still here, if we appoint people to ambassadorships and positions in Washington who have a status quo outlook, who don't recognize that this is a revolutionary time, then the United States does not maintain its influence.	0
ClaimBuster	19370				It's going to be a little tougher because we're talking about very complex and difficult issues.	0
ClaimBuster	19371				You tell Tony Blair we're going alone.	0
ClaimBuster	19372				Now, I have to come back in my clothes to one thing because I am passionate about education.	0
ClaimBuster	19373				"I'm not that concerned. """	0
ClaimBuster	19374				Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not.	1
ClaimBuster	19375				One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up, and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that's been the trend line.	0
ClaimBuster	19376				Wasn't this the George Bush that supported Mr. Meese?	0
ClaimBuster	19377				I never go anywhere, it seems like, where I don't meet somebody who has benefited from a Family Leave Law.	1
ClaimBuster	19378				They didn't have the weapons, they didn't have the tanks.	1
ClaimBuster	19379				We've had great success in my own state.	1
ClaimBuster	19380				It's about the government, as I said before, pinching its pennies for a change instead of the poor taxpayer.	0
ClaimBuster	19381				And to suggest that the SALT II treaty that your negotiators negotiated was just a continuation, and based on all of the preceding efforts by two previous Presidents, is just not true.	0
ClaimBuster	19382				The president's spending, the president's borrowing will cost this nation to have to raise taxes on the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	19383				You're stuck in a time warp in many ways.	0
ClaimBuster	19384				It simply says all these states -- it made it illegal for kids to smoke.	0
ClaimBuster	19385				Now, here are the steps that I would take, first of all.	0
ClaimBuster	19386				We've seen, in this world, a development of a tremendous threat to us.	0
ClaimBuster	19387				And the take-home pay of the richest .	0
ClaimBuster	19388				They just skim off $15 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	19389				Well, you know, nailing down Senator Obama's various tax proposals is like nailing Jell-O to the wall.	0
ClaimBuster	19390				Uh - there was one example, for instance, where uh - somebody uh - produced pornographic movies.	0
ClaimBuster	19391				So we've got to really rebuild our job base.	0
ClaimBuster	19392				Anybody can have deductions up to that amount.	0
ClaimBuster	19393				But I do not want to see a military involvement on the part of our -- of our troops.	0
ClaimBuster	19394				I'm not reconsidering my position.	0
ClaimBuster	19395				I don't believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	19396				And I think it would discipline not only the Congress, which needs it, but also the executive branch.	0
ClaimBuster	19397				There are, after all, 2 million refugees now because of the problems in what was Yugoslavia, the largest number since World War II, and there may be hundreds of thousands of people who will starve or freeze to death in this winter.	1
ClaimBuster	19398				I mean, I've told people as I've traveled around, all of you that got the tax cut he promised last time, vote for him in '96 and not many hands go up.	0
ClaimBuster	19399				And the bottom line is that the United States left in humiliation, and our enemies are stronger.	1
ClaimBuster	19400				We can help people to live better lives, and at the same time save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare, and to become productive citizens again.	0
ClaimBuster	19401				... and the rest of the answer, way off the mark.	0
ClaimBuster	19402				Of course they care about them.	0
ClaimBuster	19403				And that is why we are maintaining a deterrent and trying to achieve a deterrent capacity to where no one would believe that they could start such a war and escape with limited damage.	0
ClaimBuster	19404				"If Tom DeLay or someone in the House said to me, ""Sorry, we don't have the votes,"" I'd have said, ""Then we're going to have a fight. """	0
ClaimBuster	19405				If we have a Democratic Congress next year, and a president who wants to spend an additional one hundred billion dollars a year, or maybe two hundred billion dollars a year, with more programs, we will have in my judgment, greater deficits with more spending, more dangers of inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	19406				You say that you're going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions, without naming what those loopholes and deductions are.	0
ClaimBuster	19407				And the world benefitted tremendously from the courage that they showed in those post-war years.	0
ClaimBuster	19408				We had the worst economy in a century.	1
ClaimBuster	19409				They like it because it doesn't accomplish what I think really needs to be accomplished to give the decisions back to the doctors and nurses and give you a right of appeal to somebody other than the HMO or insurance company, let you go to the nearest emergency room without having to call an HMO before you call 911, to let you see a specialist if you need to, and it has strong bipartisan support.	1
ClaimBuster	19410				We can a big share of it, but we've got to have more help from our friends abroad; and these three factors, I think, will be very helpful in reversing the gold flow which you spoke about.	0
ClaimBuster	19411				And I'm interested in what we can trust him to do and what you can trust me to do and what you can trust Mr. Perot to do for the next 4 years.	0
ClaimBuster	19412				So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is, but he has given jobs to Chinese steelworkers, not American steelworkers.	1
ClaimBuster	19413				I don't believe that's a fair measure.	0
ClaimBuster	19414				All these other countries are looking to us.	0
ClaimBuster	19415				So we've seen a deterioration in values, and one of the things that I think we should do about it in terms of cause is to instill values into the young people in our schools.	0
ClaimBuster	19416				Can we take the time --	0
ClaimBuster	19417				We have got to do much more.	0
ClaimBuster	19418				So obviously, our policy over the last eight years has not worked.	0
ClaimBuster	19419				I understand the serious consequences of committing our troops into harm's way.	0
ClaimBuster	19420				And thanks to the Congress we now have an agricultural credit bill which is helping and improving the situation with at least some of our farmers.	1
ClaimBuster	19421				The mayor up there, on the program.	0
ClaimBuster	19422				And I think the people viewing out there ought to go back and take a look at the record when he fought a balanced budget amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	19423				"""And I've looked them in the eye and I've said, ""No, I can't do that. """	1
ClaimBuster	19424				But everybody knew that those of us who voted against the freezing of COLAs did so, we did so emphatically.	0
ClaimBuster	19425				We have seen uh - the Federal Energy Agency established, for instance.	1
ClaimBuster	19426				That's really what you should be talking about, not fiction, where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	19427				But I would leave you with this thought, sir, to be quite specific in my answer to your question: that, of course, to protect the vital interests of this country, if that became impossible; if I could not, despite the very best efforts that I asked the Congress to put forward, to raise those pay and incentives and allowances, of course, I would not leave this country go undefended.	0
ClaimBuster	19428				This year the Republican Congress, as far as student loans went from 24 billion to 36 billion over the next six years.	1
ClaimBuster	19429				And so the right course for us, is working through our partners and with our own resources, to identify responsible parties within Syria, organize them, bring them together in a -- in a form of -- if not government, a form of -- of -- of council that can take the lead in Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	19430				And in November of 1975 I was the first president to order the executive branch to take action, affirmative action, through the Department of Commerce and other cabinet departments, to make certain that no American businessman or business organization should discriminate against Jews because of an Arab boycott.	1
ClaimBuster	19431				And the reality is it's not just wealthy people -- you mentioned Donald Trump.	1
ClaimBuster	19432				Now, look, we all would love to lower taxes on everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	19433				Let me give you another example of what I mean.	0
ClaimBuster	19434				Uh - very few people knew who I was.	0
ClaimBuster	19435				I agree with the Governor on athletics.	0
ClaimBuster	19436				This is obviously an area of great concern to the entire world, and to America in particular, which is to see a -- a complete change in the -- the structure and the -- the environment in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	19437				I supported a big increase in the safe and drug-free schools program.	1
ClaimBuster	19438				I'm not sure that -- and I can understand if you haven't seen this, because there's been a lot of hue and cry.	0
ClaimBuster	19439				I don't know what it would be, but if we can come up with one, I think the world will be better off.	0
ClaimBuster	19440				You can't be a superpower unless you're an economic superpower.	0
ClaimBuster	19441				One of the reasons why I think it's important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East if need be to keep the peace to be able to say to the Saddam Hussein√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s of the world or the Iranians, don't dare threaten our friends.	0
ClaimBuster	19442				I talked about the principles and the issues that I think are important in a patient's bill of rights.	1
ClaimBuster	19443				But we all know, my friends, until we stabilize home values in America, we're never going to start turning around and creating jobs and fixing our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	19444				So four years ago I stood on a stage just like this one.	1
ClaimBuster	19445				Number three, cover people who are between jobs for up to six months.	0
ClaimBuster	19446				What I do is the same way that Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	19447				I remember 1973 in the depth of the uh - energy crisis when President Nixon called on the American people to make a sacrifice, to cut down on the waste of uh - gasoline, to cut down on the uh - speed of automobiles.	1
ClaimBuster	19448				These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love.	0
ClaimBuster	19449				I'm gonna make those decisions, and I won't raise taxes on the middle class to pay for my programs.	0
ClaimBuster	19450				But there are certain guidelines that must be followed, and I've just defined them.	0
ClaimBuster	19451				We've got to innovate through this America 2000 program.	0
ClaimBuster	19452				I'll tell you this, I want to do something about this.	0
ClaimBuster	19453				Well, first place, I'd like to clear up something because every 4 years, the Democrats go around and say, Republicans are going to cut Social Security and Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	19454				Not in an election year, sir.	0
ClaimBuster	19455				I do disagree with her judgment in many cases.	0
ClaimBuster	19456				I left on June 11th because I wanted the American people to know that I was willing to give up something.	1
ClaimBuster	19457				Make no mistake about it, they do have undue influence in Washington, D.C. and it makes a difference if you have a president who will fight for you.	0
ClaimBuster	19458				I think that color television is not as important as rocket thrust.	0
ClaimBuster	19459				We -- we have, with our partners in the region, we have sufficient resources to support those groups.	1
ClaimBuster	19460				I'm not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	19461				Secondly, on the question of our position in the United Nations.	0
ClaimBuster	19462				I still believe it was the right thing to do.	0
ClaimBuster	19463				But gosh to tell our kids that before they have babies, they ought to think about getting married to someone, that's a great idea.	0
ClaimBuster	19464				And no one has approached it from that matter.	0
ClaimBuster	19465				If the United States had stronger prestige and influence in Latin America it could persuade - as Franklin Roosevelt did in 1940 - the countries of Latin America to join in an economic quarantine of Castro.	1
ClaimBuster	19466				I hear it -- I hear it echoed by political opponents.	0
ClaimBuster	19467				How's it going to affect my job?	0
ClaimBuster	19468				And if you can't get there, just recognize we're all stuck with one another because nobody's going anywhere, right?	0
ClaimBuster	19469				There was no doubt in my mind that Saddam Hussein was hoping that the world would turn a blind eye.	0
ClaimBuster	19470				Some of it's said -- somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.	0
ClaimBuster	19471				Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here.	1
ClaimBuster	19472				And that's his record, and that's a matter of his record.	0
ClaimBuster	19473				But when we can -- when we have an issue that we may hand our children and our grandchildren a damaged planet, I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue.	1
ClaimBuster	19474				General Petraeus invited Senator Lindsey Graham and me to attend a ceremony where 688 brave young Americans, whose enlistment had expired, were reenlisting to stay and fight for Iraqi freedom and American freedom.	1
ClaimBuster	19475				So it will be a modern Medicare system that trusts you to make a variety of options for you.	0
ClaimBuster	19476				And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.	0
ClaimBuster	19477				I don't think we need to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	19478				I think uh - the way to get tax equity in this country is to give tax relief to the middle-income people who have an income from roughly $8 thousand up to twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars.	0
ClaimBuster	19479				Our system of government - in spite of Vietnam, Cambodia, CIA, Watergate - is still the best system of government on earth.	0
ClaimBuster	19480				Is someone going to take our check away from us and leave us destitute?''	0
ClaimBuster	19481				First of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year.	1
ClaimBuster	19482				I believe that a lot of people are skeptical about people in politics today because we have seen a time of great challenge for our country.	0
ClaimBuster	19483				So we won't make them famous.	0
ClaimBuster	19484				People are going to pour into our country.	0
ClaimBuster	19485				And not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home, and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government.	1
ClaimBuster	19486				I think that's wrong, and I think we can do better.	0
ClaimBuster	19487				I've heard of those dividends in the past; it always happens.	0
ClaimBuster	19488				Whether or not it's -- the same in domestic policy as well.	0
ClaimBuster	19489				But the Federal Government doesn't make money.	1
ClaimBuster	19490				So my argument is not with Ross Perot; it is more with Governor Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	19491				Health care, schools--one on the debt and deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	19492				We're going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling.	0
ClaimBuster	19493				Now, how -- what's -- what's the best way of fixing it?	0
ClaimBuster	19494				And to move this country forward and we're better off than we were four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	19495				Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that.	1
ClaimBuster	19496				You have the ISI, their intelligence organization, is probably the most powerful of the -- of three branches there.	1
ClaimBuster	19497				Those schools belong to you.	0
ClaimBuster	19498				Governor Clinton's program wants to tax more and spend more -- $150 billion in new taxes, spend another $220.	1
ClaimBuster	19499				We ought to love one another because united teams win and divided teams lose.	0
ClaimBuster	19500				... would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt.	1
ClaimBuster	19501				I would consider anyone in their qualifications.	0
ClaimBuster	19502				I want to see growing peace in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	19503				The center is Afghanistan, where, incidentally, there were more Americans killed last year than the year before; where the opium production is 75 percent of the world's opium production; where 40 to 60 percent of the economy of Afghanistan is based on opium; where the elections have been postponed three times.	1
ClaimBuster	19504				I've supported the President when I thought he was right on Bosnia.	1
ClaimBuster	19505				It's not accidental that the presidents of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine flew to Georgia, flew to Tbilisi, where I have spent significant amount of time with a great young president, Misha Saakashvili.	1
ClaimBuster	19506				I did a lot of work on this.	1
ClaimBuster	19507				That's kind of pathetic I have to do it -- and nobody's called me yet to come up, I might mention.	1
ClaimBuster	19508				If there's anything that's going to change America it's get the economy growing.	0
ClaimBuster	19509				We are a country of laws.	1
ClaimBuster	19510				Let me mention another regulation in Dodd-Frank.	0
ClaimBuster	19511				Today, if you're an American business, you actually get a benefit for going overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	19512				Well, I'm pleased with the results of the election.	0
ClaimBuster	19513				And the battlefield was searched, and there wasn't one single iota of evidence that any US weapons were on that battlefield.	1
ClaimBuster	19514				Are the Soviets coming out of Afghanistan?	0
ClaimBuster	19515				But we always have to stand up for democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	19516				"And when the President was asked the other day, ""What do you want to cut in the budget?"	0
ClaimBuster	19517				It will work, and when it does work, Mr. President, I know you'll congratulate me.	0
ClaimBuster	19518				I'll get him no matter what and I know how to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	19519				So, we've got to move forward with those negotiations, get the level of strategic weapons down.	0
ClaimBuster	19520				The research and development to be used primary to make the coal burning uh - be clean.	0
ClaimBuster	19521				And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem.	0
ClaimBuster	19522				We had an energy bill before the United States Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	19523				By being steadfast and resolute and strong, by keeping our word, by supporting our troops, we can achieve the peace we all want.	0
ClaimBuster	19524				Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on.	0
ClaimBuster	19525				We're going to give them tax cuts so they can spend more time with their children, maybe even take a vacation.	0
ClaimBuster	19526				That was actually mine, actually, Mr. President.	1
ClaimBuster	19527				We need to make education the number one priority in our country and treat teachers like the professionals that they are.	0
ClaimBuster	19528				So let me repeat, I do have respect for my opponent, for his family, for the justifiable pride he takes in his heritage.	0
ClaimBuster	19529				But, the fact of the matter is that this is something that we must begin it's going to take at least the first year of the new administration.	0
ClaimBuster	19530				I'm asking for your vote.	0
ClaimBuster	19531				But here's what I don't want people to forget when we're talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn't just that 20 million got insurance who didn't have it before.	1
ClaimBuster	19532				We've got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them.	0
ClaimBuster	19533				So let's have paid family leave, earned sick days.	0
ClaimBuster	19534				And our eighth graders number one in English and also in math.	1
ClaimBuster	19535				And that's not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy.	0
ClaimBuster	19536				You'll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare Advantage.	1
ClaimBuster	19537				And I know Donald's trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand: This election's really up to you.	0
ClaimBuster	19538				If you ever got close to how textbooks were selected, you wouldn't want to go back the second day.	0
ClaimBuster	19539				I'm a father of sons; I have a grandson.	1
ClaimBuster	19540				That's why I reach out to the Perot voters.	0
ClaimBuster	19541				Eleven other presidents -- six Democrats and five Republicans -- had wars, had recessions, had great difficulties; none of them lost jobs the way this president has.	1
ClaimBuster	19542				And I found myself wondering what it would be like for someone -- wondering if someone 100 years from now would be driving down that highway, and if they would see the same thing.	0
ClaimBuster	19543				I think we gave them a good opportunity - we're - I don't think we should go any further.	0
ClaimBuster	19544				So, shift from oil to coal, emphasize research and development on coal use and also on solar power, strict conservation measures, not yield every time that the special interest groups uh - put pressure on the president like uh this administration has done, and use atomic energy only as a last resort with the strictest possible safety precautions.	0
ClaimBuster	19545				And I challenge you tonight to deny that the Administration has sent at least several missions to persuade Chiang Kai-shek's withdrawal from these islands.	1
ClaimBuster	19546				We must stand for our ideals.	0
ClaimBuster	19547				We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.	0
ClaimBuster	19548				And what we need now is a president who understands how to bring these other countries together to recognize their stakes in this.	0
ClaimBuster	19549				That is absolutely proved over and over again.	0
ClaimBuster	19550				We're now about to have an agreement for status of forces in Iraq coming up.	0
ClaimBuster	19551				But I think we're all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools.	0
ClaimBuster	19552				And wait until you see what happens in the coming years.	0
ClaimBuster	19553				First of all, I think you must have some principles you believe in.	0
ClaimBuster	19554				This used to be a bipartisan issue.	0
ClaimBuster	19555				Now, how does that grab you for increasing housing?	0
ClaimBuster	19556				Ten million citizens have registered to vote.	1
ClaimBuster	19557				Our law enforcement must have every tool necessary to find and disrupt terrorists at home and abroad before they hurt us again.	0
ClaimBuster	19558				So we use diplomacy every chance we get, believe me.	0
ClaimBuster	19559				And some of those programs may not grow as much as we would like for them to, but we can establish priorities with full transparency, with full knowledge of the American people, and full consultation, not done behind closed doors and shoving earmarks in the middle of the night into programs that we don't even -- sometimes we don't even know about until months later.	0
ClaimBuster	19560				I'm for the taxpayer bill of rights.	0
ClaimBuster	19561				They have had their chance to get something done.	0
ClaimBuster	19562				I think character is a very important question.	0
ClaimBuster	19563				As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that.	0
ClaimBuster	19564				Now, the last point I'd make before...	0
ClaimBuster	19565				Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top.	1
ClaimBuster	19566				The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.	0
ClaimBuster	19567				It's a fact they did.	1
ClaimBuster	19568				Of course, it doesn't come out of the payroll tax.	1
ClaimBuster	19569				Do you know what he presented us with?	0
ClaimBuster	19570				The Rockefeller Brothers report, General Ridgway, General Gavin, the Gaither Report, various reports of Congressional committees all indicate that the relative strength of the p- United States both militarily, politically, psychologically, and scientifically and industrially - the relative strength of the so- of United States compared to that of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists together - has deteriorated in the last eight years and we should know it, and the American people should be told the facts.	1
ClaimBuster	19571				This is a president who has not been able to do what he said he'd do.	0
ClaimBuster	19572				This question of leadership keeps arising in different forms in this discussion already.	0
ClaimBuster	19573				Now, with respect to ACORN, ACORN is a community organization.	1
ClaimBuster	19574				Nine times I have raised my hand to take an oath to the Constitution, and I have never violated that oath.	1
ClaimBuster	19575				And I accept what the president has said.	0
ClaimBuster	19576				We're down at 1 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	19577				We won't wait one year or two years longer, as Governor Carter uh - indicates.	0
ClaimBuster	19578				We've got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto areas, uh - particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups, sometimes 50 or 60 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	19579				I can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you.	1
ClaimBuster	19580				Today, by his own decision, the misery index is in excess of 20%, and I think this must suggest something.	1
ClaimBuster	19581				Now as far as meeting with the Congress is concerned, during the twenty-four months that I've been the president of the United States I have averaged better than one meeting a month with responsible groups or committees of the Congress - both House and Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	19582				And I do not believe the government should be making it.	0
ClaimBuster	19583				I don't think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force.	0
ClaimBuster	19584				And we have a fundamental choice to make.	0
ClaimBuster	19585				I have a long record and the American people know me very well and that is independent and a maverick of the Senate and I'm happy to say that I've got a partner that's a good maverick along with me now.	0
ClaimBuster	19586				Is, as Mr. Nixon says, our prestige at an all-time high, as he said a week ago, and that of the Communists at an all-time low?	1
ClaimBuster	19587				The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border.	1
ClaimBuster	19588				In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back every single dime, with interest.	1
ClaimBuster	19589				It will cause the six-party talks to evaporate.	0
ClaimBuster	19590				It's my understanding that Governor Carter has indicated that uh - he approves of a $30 billion uh - expenditure by the federal government as far as education is concerned.	1
ClaimBuster	19591				But -- and I think the United States can do whatever we reasonably can.	0
ClaimBuster	19592				I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto.	1
ClaimBuster	19593				And in my administration, we're going to train the National Guard to stop it from coming across the border.	0
ClaimBuster	19594				But I hope that from here on you will no longer be saying that particular thing, which is absolutely false.	0
ClaimBuster	19595				But we got to be more aggressive.	0
ClaimBuster	19596				But two years later nobody's lost their handguns.	1
ClaimBuster	19597				But he also voted then for an amendment - which was lost, fortunately - an amendment which would have drawn a line and left out those islands and denied the p- right to the president to defend those islands if he thought that it was an attack on Formosa.	1
ClaimBuster	19598				We can do better than that.	0
ClaimBuster	19599				Now, let me mention one other thing, and that is self-deportation says let people make their own choice.	0
ClaimBuster	19600				Nobody should smoke, young or old, but particularly young people should not smoke, but my record is there.	0
ClaimBuster	19601				We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved.	0
ClaimBuster	19602				And that's a case where we need to use our influence to have countries in Africa come together and help deal with the situation.	0
ClaimBuster	19603				And I think I've had that.	0
ClaimBuster	19604				Cheryl, the president didn't find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, so he's really turned his campaign into a weapon of mass deception.	1
ClaimBuster	19605				Now I'm the senior Democrat on it.	1
ClaimBuster	19606				They're innocent victims of greed and excess on Wall Street and as well as Washington, D.C. And they're angry, and they have every reason to be angry.	0
ClaimBuster	19607				Well, this is an area where Senator McCain and I have a fundamental difference because I think the first question is whether we should have gone into the war in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	19608				I think Senator Dole and I just honestly disagree.	0
ClaimBuster	19609				I don't think we ought to join that.	0
ClaimBuster	19610				"As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called ""Lincoln."""	1
ClaimBuster	19611				Let me say first, on the President's promise for another tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	19612				We could add to jobs in the major metropolitan areas by a proposal that I recommended that would give tax incentives to business to move into the inner city and to expand or to build new plants so that they would take a plant, or expand a plant where people are, and people are currently unemployed.	0
ClaimBuster	19613				We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.	1
ClaimBuster	19614				But science, there's a lot -- there's differing opinions.	0
ClaimBuster	19615				Three, a Gallup Poll taken in February asked people in ten countries which country they thought would be first in 1970, both scientifically and militarily.	1
ClaimBuster	19616				Well just let me point this out; he voted for the resolution in 1955 which gave the president the power to use the forces of the United States to defend Formosa and the offshore islands.	1
ClaimBuster	19617				And by that I mean we're moving troops out of Korea and replacing them with more effective weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	19618				I didn't think it was a mission worthwhile.	0
ClaimBuster	19619				Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.	1
ClaimBuster	19620				There's been millions and millions of dollars of negative advertising spent distorting my views.	1
ClaimBuster	19621				Well, you know, it's hard to make people love one another.	0
ClaimBuster	19622				But the Administration and the Republican majority in the Congress has opposed any realistic aid to education.	1
ClaimBuster	19623				While the secretary of state's in one country, there are almost a hundred and fifty others that are wondering what we're gonna do next, what will be the next secret agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	19624				And this is what we did.	0
ClaimBuster	19625				What does this mean in real life?	0
ClaimBuster	19626				If we don't, the bureaucratic mess is going to continue.	0
ClaimBuster	19627				The only thing an executive order can accomplish is to ban it in federal law enforcement agencies, but I would also support a law in the Congress that would have the effect of doing the same thing.	0
ClaimBuster	19628				What if we did -- and I hope we can; we're still researching -- what if we come up with a weapon that renders those missiles obsolete?	0
ClaimBuster	19629				That's not the right answer for America.	0
ClaimBuster	19630				It's not an opinion; it's a fact.	0
ClaimBuster	19631				You want me to answer a question --	0
ClaimBuster	19632				I think, for example, if we're convinced that a Third World country that's got a lot of debt would reform itself, that the money wouldn't go into the hands of a few but would go to help people, I think it makes sense for us to use our wealth in that way, or to trade debt for valuable rain forest lands, makes that much sense, yes.	0
ClaimBuster	19633				And I think being Governor of California is probably the closest thing to the Presidency, if that's possible, of any executive job in America today - because it is the most populous state.	0
ClaimBuster	19634				We can't afford to give up that opportunity until later.	0
ClaimBuster	19635				We gave more scholarships to the Congo - this summer we offered them - than we've given to all of Africa the year before.	1
ClaimBuster	19636				There are companies that wanted to petition the administration.	0
ClaimBuster	19637				Now we're going back to when the mother's pregnant and they'll start right after they're born.	0
ClaimBuster	19638				You leave future generations with tremendous IOUs.	0
ClaimBuster	19639				I want to be judicious in its use.	0
ClaimBuster	19640				Let me just say the first -- this business about the entitlement he tried to describe about savings, you know, matching savings here and matching savings there, fully-funded it's gonna cost a whole lot of money, a lot more than we have.	0
ClaimBuster	19641				And for two years, this administration didn't talk at all to North Korea.	1
ClaimBuster	19642				It must be economic; it must be technological; above all it must be ideological.	0
ClaimBuster	19643				But in any event, no tax.	0
ClaimBuster	19644				That, too, would have to be worked out then, when you once recognize that we're talking about a life.	0
ClaimBuster	19645				But I don't confuse words with strength; and in my judgment if the summit was useful, if it would have brought us closer to peace, that rather than the lie that we told - which has been criticized by all responsible people afterwards - it would have been far better for us to follow the common diplomatic procedure of expressing regrets and then try to move on.	0
ClaimBuster	19646				They want to be free.	1
ClaimBuster	19647				She worked her way up, only had a high school education, started as a secretary, ended up being the vice president of a local bank.	1
ClaimBuster	19648				Well, I support our democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	19649				It's nice to -- one on three.	0
ClaimBuster	19650				It's about who can get the middle class in this country a bright and prosperous future and assure our kids the kind of hope and optimism they deserve.	0
ClaimBuster	19651				The President was unsuccessful; Chiang Kai-shek would not withdraw.	1
ClaimBuster	19652				That's always been a serious crime and always should be a serious crime.	0
ClaimBuster	19653				He went to Philippines in the early 80√É¬è√¢‚Äö¬¨s and commended Ferdinand Macros for his commitment to democracy.	1
ClaimBuster	19654				At the same time, as I have said earlier, we have added about nine million net new jobs in that period of time - a record never before achieved.	1
ClaimBuster	19655				Because they are low wage, low skill jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	19656				But this administration doesn't believe the way to reduce unemployment is to go to war, or to increase the number of people in the military.	0
ClaimBuster	19657				Well, I wondered, when Governor Clinton was talking to the auto workers, whether he talked about his and Senator Gore's favoring CAFE standards, fuel efficiency standards, of 40 miles per gallon.	0
ClaimBuster	19658				In my view, the policy has failed.	0
ClaimBuster	19659				And that drives our friends to the south up into our region, and we need to end those deficits as well.	0
ClaimBuster	19660				And that's what you're faced with, the parents are faced with, and the grand parents are faced with.	0
ClaimBuster	19661				There are many good ones, but I was glad he acknowledged that.	0
ClaimBuster	19662				And what I have to say about this is, many times -- and this has to do with the Philippines, also, I know there are things there in the Philippines that do not look good to us from the standpoint right now of democratic rights, but what is the alternative?	1
ClaimBuster	19663				So there are some -- some things that we've got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy.	0
ClaimBuster	19664				And Main Street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in Washington, D.C., and in the Wall Street.	1
ClaimBuster	19665				Are we building the future that this nation needs?	0
ClaimBuster	19666				I think there's a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	19667				I led for the Earl Wallop bill or formerly Dingell-Johnson.	1
ClaimBuster	19668				Our plan is better, it will take us into the future with a growing economy and healthier families.	0
ClaimBuster	19669				So, judge the man on his record not on the-lot of rumors and innuendo and trying to fool around with his name.	0
ClaimBuster	19670				Whenever we do anything that's wrong, we can express regrets.	0
ClaimBuster	19671				Under my plan, they get $1800 of tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	19672				"But I do know that if the president of the United States and the Congress of the United States and the people of the United States said, ""I believe our nation is greater than what we are now."""	0
ClaimBuster	19673				And by the way, we've also changed the culture of the FBI to have counterterrorism as its number one priority.	1
ClaimBuster	19674				Did get a 3 percent increase this year, but that's not enough.	1
ClaimBuster	19675				We're going to have to spend more money in the future on military technology and on greater mobility, greater airlift, greater sealift, the B-22 airplane.	0
ClaimBuster	19676				People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	19677				The president wants to keep them open.	1
ClaimBuster	19678				They're going to many other countries.	1
ClaimBuster	19679				I don't think it was helpful when he suggested - and I'm glad he's corrected this to an extent - that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night in the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	19680				And that's why it's so important, as we solve this short-term problem, that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led to wages and incomes for ordinary Americans to go down, the -- a health care system that is broken, energy policies that are not working, because, you know, 10 days ago, John said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.	1
ClaimBuster	19681				That's more than it's had a lot of the time in the last years.	1
ClaimBuster	19682				And America now is paying, already $120 billion, up to $200 billion before we're finished and much more probably.	1
ClaimBuster	19683				I can sometimes take myself too seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	19684				The one-man, one-vote rule, which is a very important one that uh - s- struck down the unwarranted influence in the legislature of parsley - uh populated areas of - of the states.	0
ClaimBuster	19685				No -- well, what the Vice President must not understand is we've got a hate crimes bill in Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	19686				In a discussion of our strategic arms negotiations, I said that submarines carrying missiles and airplanes carrying missiles were more conventional-type weapons, not as destabilizing as the land-based missiles, and that they were also weapons that -- or carriers -- that if they were sent out and there was a change, you could call them back before they had launched their missiles.	1
ClaimBuster	19687				You remember the last time you said that?	0
ClaimBuster	19688				But I will never turn over our national- security decisions to leaders of other countries.	0
ClaimBuster	19689				And that is one of the challenges that America faces.	0
ClaimBuster	19690				I have been for those efforts all my life.	1
ClaimBuster	19691				I will be the president and we will get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	19692				The people that are out there trying to help these kids, the programs like cities and schools, the work that Barbara Bush is doing so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty.	0
ClaimBuster	19693				I. too, believe in the voluntary military.	0
ClaimBuster	19694				Yes, I'd like to respond very much.	0
ClaimBuster	19695				We dramatically increased investment and our jobs are growing.	1
ClaimBuster	19696				Each situation is different, Robin.	0
ClaimBuster	19697				Mr. Movers, in addition to saying that this is no time for a tax cut, in view of the incipient signs of renewed inflation, in addition to calling for restraint in Federal spending, 15 months ago, I also suggested we ought to have an emergency excise tax on gasoline.	1
ClaimBuster	19698				They're between 100 and 200% capacity up and down the East Coast.	1
ClaimBuster	19699				We're not going to spend hundreds of millions on a space plane from Washington to Tokyo.	0
ClaimBuster	19700				All she had to do was stay there, and now we're going in to get it.	0
ClaimBuster	19701				So let me summarize by saying this: I'm not satisfied with what we're doing in the cold war because I believe we have to step up our activities and launch an offensive for the minds and hearts and souls of men.	0
ClaimBuster	19702				New York is being taxed for money that will then go to Detroit.	1
ClaimBuster	19703				You bet your hat we can govern because we will be in there together and we will figure out what to do, and you won't tolerate gridlock, you won't tolerate endless meandering and wandering around, and you won't tolerate non-performance.	0
ClaimBuster	19704				It's not the way America is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	19705				I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe...	0
ClaimBuster	19706				What are freedom's chances in those areas?	0
ClaimBuster	19707				Opposes an amendment to protect the flag of the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	19708				He lost 1.6 million, ladies and gentlemen.	1
ClaimBuster	19709				Every action being taken against terrorists requires court order, requires scrutiny.	0
ClaimBuster	19710				I think we've got to invest in education and training.	0
ClaimBuster	19711				He inherited a growth of 4.7 4.8 percent, now it's down to about 2.4 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	19712				Older folks, less healthy folks, what's going to end up happening is that you're going to be the only ones left in your employer-based system, your employers won't be able to afford it.	0
ClaimBuster	19713				... that's offshore back into the country.	0
ClaimBuster	19714				They understand, why can't they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership?	0
ClaimBuster	19715				Everyone who does business with the government should have the opportunity to make sure that they do not practice discrimination in their hiring.	0
ClaimBuster	19716				We've climbed the mighty mountain.	0
ClaimBuster	19717				I believe that the only unpopular measures, actually, that could be, or would be applied, would be unpopular with the government, and with those.	0
ClaimBuster	19718				The power of example is America's greatest power in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	19719				Americans are hurting tonight in a way they have not in our generation.	0
ClaimBuster	19720				He went after Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a Gold Star family, because of their religion.	1
ClaimBuster	19721				It takes a commitment to being involved and the leading.	0
ClaimBuster	19722				I think it's an issue that we need to take very seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	19723				It will mean that China no longer is involved in convincing, along with us, for Kim Jong Il to get rid of his weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	19724				They thought they were going to have peace - it brought war.	1
ClaimBuster	19725				I think if you raise taxes during a recession, you head to depression.	0
ClaimBuster	19726				I'm for Head Start and moving that up.	0
ClaimBuster	19727				The answer is to invest and grow this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	19728				Let me just give you one other example.	0
ClaimBuster	19729				It's very bad, very bad health insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	19730				And he refuses to put anything, controls, on these crazy lawsuits.	1
ClaimBuster	19731				These young people, when they get out of this wonderful university, will have difficulty finding a job.	0
ClaimBuster	19732				It will go to everybody who pays taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	19733				... of judgment, of whether or not -- of whether or not -- if the question is who is best-equipped as the next president to make good decisions about how we use our military, how we make sure that we are prepared and ready for the next conflict, then I think we can take a look at our judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	19734				And people have to decide.	0
ClaimBuster	19735				Your father was right to stand up to Joe McCarthy, you were wrong to attack my patriotism.	0
ClaimBuster	19736				The Administration tried to do it repeatedly, repeatedly in 81 82.	0
ClaimBuster	19737				So I believe that we need to control the growth of mandatory spending, back to this gentleman's question.	0
ClaimBuster	19738				Risk your troops in a war you've called a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	19739				That was Senator McCain's judgment and it was the wrong judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	19740				You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A1 great investments when they weren't.	1
ClaimBuster	19741				I've had a record of doing so in the State of Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	19742				Why are these plants being closed down?	0
ClaimBuster	19743				He wanted first uh - we know, Austria, and then he went on to the Sudetenland and then Danzig, and each time it was thought this is all that he wanted.	1
ClaimBuster	19744				"And before he rushes and says, ""You know, before you and President Obama were there,"" I think it's important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades."	1
ClaimBuster	19745				Immediately before the Kansas City convention, he added back another one point eight billion dollars in the defense budget.	1
ClaimBuster	19746				So the net cost would be 8 billion 6 years from now in a trillion-plus budget -- not very much.	1
ClaimBuster	19747				That is the closest I have ever heard the Governor of Massachusetts come to support anything having to do with nuclear, that's about as close as I've ever heard him Yes, this Savannah River plant needs to be made more safe.	0
ClaimBuster	19748				I think that's the wrong thing.	0
ClaimBuster	19749				The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission.	1
ClaimBuster	19750				But again, I repeat to my fellow citizens, the best way to protection is to stay on the offense.	0
ClaimBuster	19751				And this isn't -- this isn't going to be necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	19752				What I think troubles a lot of people in our country is that the president has just sort of described one kind of mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	19753				I do not believe we need to go back to the Mondale proposals or the Dukakis proposals of tax and spend.	0
ClaimBuster	19754				A President can't know everything, but a President has to know those things that are essential to his leadership and the enforcement of our laws.	0
ClaimBuster	19755				Now, I'll tell ya this.	0
ClaimBuster	19756				And we have uninsured people in my state.	1
ClaimBuster	19757				If they overturned it, it will go back to the states.	0
ClaimBuster	19758				And, now, I think the American people are less interested in our hurt feelings during the course of the campaign than addressing the issues that matter to them so deeply.	0
ClaimBuster	19759				Secondly, I believe that the high interest-rate policy that this Administration has followed has added about three billion dollars a year to interest on the debt - merely funding the debt - which is a burden an the taxpayers.	1
ClaimBuster	19760				There is pending now in the Congress a national hate crimes law because of James Byrd, because of Matthew Shepard, who was crucified on a split rail fence by bigots, and because of others.	1
ClaimBuster	19761				I've got a different view.	0
ClaimBuster	19762				We have a divided nation, because people like her -- and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart.	0
ClaimBuster	19763				And she has ignited our party and people all over America that have never been involved in the political process.	0
ClaimBuster	19764				Medicare -- I cast the tie-breaking vote to add 26 years to the life of Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	19765				As a matter of fact, based on the announcement this week, there will be at an annual rate of a million, eight hundred and some thousand new houses built, which is a tremendous increase over last year and a substantial increase over the earlier part of this year.	1
ClaimBuster	19766				And the effect of these economic policies is like a massive grain embargo, which has caused farm exports to drop 20 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	19767				He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching.	1
ClaimBuster	19768				And that's what is going to happen should I earn your confidence.	0
ClaimBuster	19769				We'll bring back manufacturing to America.	0
ClaimBuster	19770				For the very reason that those Senators knew, as the President of the United States knew, that you should not indicate to the Communists in advance that you're going to surrender an area that's free.	0
ClaimBuster	19771				But I'm not proud of any record, sir, I'm not.	0
ClaimBuster	19772				So I want to get some relief to middle-income families.	0
ClaimBuster	19773				So the point is with nuclear power, with wind, tide, solar, natural gas, with development of flex fuel, hybrid, clean coal technology, clean coal technology is key in the heartland of America that's hurting rather badly.	0
ClaimBuster	19774				Secondly, I believe that in the ca- that it's far better for the United States, instead of concentrating our aid, particularly in the underdeveloped world, on surplus military equipment - we poured three hundred million dollars of surplus military equipment into Laos.	1
ClaimBuster	19775				Well, Andrea, you didn't predicate that lack of economists' support for what I call a flexible freeze, because some good very good economists do support that concept.	0
ClaimBuster	19776				Let the local entity, the city, declare this particular area, based on the standards of the percentage of people on welfare, unemployed, and so forth, in that area.	0
ClaimBuster	19777				There's a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts.	0
ClaimBuster	19778				The reason that we raise concerns, not just in election years, but every year, because Republicans, once they're elected and start cutting.	0
ClaimBuster	19779				We are working with countries in the region to make sure, for example, that ships can pass through; that commerce continues.	1
ClaimBuster	19780				And I'm proposing a plan that will give tax credits and tax incentives for the rapid development of new kinds of cars and trucks and buses and factories and boilers and furnaces that don't have as much pollution, that don't burn as much energy, and that help us get out on the cutting edge of the new technologies that will create millions of new jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	19781				We need to cover more kids.	0
ClaimBuster	19782				We will kill bin Laden; we will crush Al Qaida.	0
ClaimBuster	19783				We have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.	0
ClaimBuster	19784				They're going to be put to death.	1
ClaimBuster	19785				You know, and everybody's ducking it so I'm gonna say it, that we are not letting that surplus stay in the bank.	0
ClaimBuster	19786				Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important.	0
ClaimBuster	19787				And also, I'm going to institute zero-based budgeting which I used four years in Georgia, which uh - assesses every program every year, and eliminates those programs that are obsolete or obsolescent.	1
ClaimBuster	19788				I may not be for your version, Mr. Vice President, but I'm for what I just described to the lady.	0
ClaimBuster	19789				But that's what I feel.	0
ClaimBuster	19790				So I'll just keep saying, I am one.	0
ClaimBuster	19791				I think that the American people also need to be a little more responsible and think about whether there's a connection with their lives and what we do in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	19792				Well, I don't believe it would be appropriate for a president to suggest that the banking system is not sound.	0
ClaimBuster	19793				My opponent said that America must pass a global test before we used force to protect ourselves.	1
ClaimBuster	19794				And I believe we've got the results to show we're on the right track.	0
ClaimBuster	19795				He said nice things about me.	1
ClaimBuster	19796				And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.	0
ClaimBuster	19797				Well, the invasion of Afghanistan didn't take place on our watch.	1
ClaimBuster	19798				And I have not made it an issue, nor should it be.	0
ClaimBuster	19799				After he fired James Schlesinger, the political heat got so great that he added back about $3 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	19800				A mission that doesn't try to be all things to all people.	0
ClaimBuster	19801				Let me simply say that I think it has to be the woman in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs that makes that decision, and I think that's the right approach, the right decision, and I would hope by this time that Mr. Bush had sorted out this issue and come to terms with it as I have.	0
ClaimBuster	19802				And that means 98 percent of American families, 97 percent of small businesses, they will not see a tax increase.	1
ClaimBuster	19803				And I think to answer your question, I think both of us care a lot about the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	19804				"By the way, when Senator Obama said he would unilaterally renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Canadians said, ""Yes, and we'll sell our oil to China."""	1
ClaimBuster	19805				We don't need as much manpower on the Korean Peninsula to keep a deterrent.	0
ClaimBuster	19806				And so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity; that our schools are working; that if there's violence on the streets, that working with faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of control.	0
ClaimBuster	19807				We have to protect our capacity to push forward what America's all about.	0
ClaimBuster	19808				And my opponent was unwilling to support that action.	0
ClaimBuster	19809				The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do.	0
ClaimBuster	19810				There ought to be a clear, unequivocal commitment without change to Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	19811				I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing.	0
ClaimBuster	19812				She's lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the FBI.	1
ClaimBuster	19813				Look, I fully recognize I'm not of Washington.	1
ClaimBuster	19814				They have the bargain of the century.	0
ClaimBuster	19815				And, in fact, an across-the-board spending freeze is a hatchet, and we do need a scalpel, because there are some programs that don't work at all.	0
ClaimBuster	19816				But not a one of those key democratic leaders support our policy in Central America.	1
ClaimBuster	19817				Those decisions generally -- generally are not poll-tested.	1
ClaimBuster	19818				That's what this election is about.	0
ClaimBuster	19819				This is a serious issue, and I think we ought to understand completely if we disagree, and if so, where.	0
ClaimBuster	19820				They're very important parts of the safety net of health care.	0
ClaimBuster	19821				And, you know, yes, have we had some fights between me and the Republicans when -- when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of Wall Street?	1
ClaimBuster	19822				They've got people allowed to go into churches now and political meetings without any showing of potential criminal activity or otherwise.	0
ClaimBuster	19823				Legislators make law; judges interpret the Constitution.	1
ClaimBuster	19824				A minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement, because he believes his faith instructs him to do that, I admire.	0
ClaimBuster	19825				So let me talk about my 30 years in public service.	0
ClaimBuster	19826				They ought to be engaged in making high speed rail.	0
ClaimBuster	19827				And I specifically would like to know whether Governor Bush will support the Dingle-Norwood bill, which is the main one pending.	1
ClaimBuster	19828				I started with a $1 million loan.	1
ClaimBuster	19829				I just have an honest philosophical difference.	0
ClaimBuster	19830				I do believe that we need to control mandatory spending.	0
ClaimBuster	19831				No, I am confident about the American economy.	0
ClaimBuster	19832				But let's go back to the original point.	0
ClaimBuster	19833				Well, I actually agree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	19834				We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.	0
ClaimBuster	19835				We are never going to fix it by the parties, because Democrats want a better advantage for themselves, we want a better advantage as Republicans, and that's not how it's going to work.	0
ClaimBuster	19836				China has finally agreed to stop sending us products made with prison labor.	1
ClaimBuster	19837				If they do, they're make-work jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	19838				Then finally, our government passes laws and freezes the plan in concrete.	1
ClaimBuster	19839				And so it's a combination of these things.	0
ClaimBuster	19840				They are members of NATO.	1
ClaimBuster	19841				I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.	0
ClaimBuster	19842				I've thought a lot about what it means to be the president.	0
ClaimBuster	19843				We're weak in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	19844				That was a mistake as well, and it cost thousands of jobs for American workers in the Midwest and all over the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	19845				Now, there are all kinds of good ideas, brilliant ideas, terrific ideas on health care.	0
ClaimBuster	19846				I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy.	1
ClaimBuster	19847				I built a massive company, a great company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, worth many, many billions of dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	19848				Now all you got that tax cut, congratulations.	0
ClaimBuster	19849				I don't know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great -- I'm very proud of my children.	0
ClaimBuster	19850				I mean, look at the facts.	0
ClaimBuster	19851				I'll give you an example.	0
ClaimBuster	19852				It's destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses.	0
ClaimBuster	19853				There's much we can do with them with respect to homeland security.	0
ClaimBuster	19854				There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.	1
ClaimBuster	19855				If you get grassroots America excited about it, and if they tap Congress on the shoulder and say do it, Charlie, it'll happen.	0
ClaimBuster	19856				You know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things.	0
ClaimBuster	19857				Whether or not it was a clear understanding as to what the mission would be.	0
ClaimBuster	19858				Did anybody go out and ask the people, how are you going to pay the extra money?	0
ClaimBuster	19859				That will reduce medical errors and reduce costs.	1
ClaimBuster	19860				Let me tell you what we have done.	0
ClaimBuster	19861				It would be very disturbing to American people.	0
ClaimBuster	19862				I don't want to send troops any place.	0
ClaimBuster	19863				But I'll tell you this: As president, I'll never take my eye off that ball.	0
ClaimBuster	19864				And incidentally if Senator Kennedy disagrees, he should indicate where he believes those policies are different from those he's advocating today.	0
ClaimBuster	19865				Well - we now have such uh - a low utilization of uh - our productive capacity - uh about 73 percent; I think it's about the lowest since the Great Depression years - and such a high unemployment rate now - uh 7.9 percent - that - uh we have a long way to go in getting people to work before we have the inflationary pressures.	1
ClaimBuster	19866				It's how we're going to grow this economy over the long term.	0
ClaimBuster	19867				They'll have more than Great Britain sometime in the -- in the relatively near future.	0
ClaimBuster	19868				But the deterrent -- and that's what it is for -- is also what led me to propose what is now being called the Star Wars concept, but propose that we research to see if there isn't a defensive weapon that could defend against incoming missiles.	0
ClaimBuster	19869				So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare.	0
ClaimBuster	19870				Do we need to fix it, particularly for OGBYNs (sic) and for brain surgeons and others?	0
ClaimBuster	19871				But we do need to make sure that as we -- as we send support for them, that this is tied to them making progress on -- on matters that would lead them to becoming a civil society.	0
ClaimBuster	19872				That's really what you're -- when they ask about the mistakes, that's what they're talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	19873				It wasn't until we had a Republican Congress you even thought about, you talked about tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	19874				This probably has more to do with our economic future than anything and that means it also has a national security implication, because there's never been a nation on earth that saw its economy decline and continued to maintain its primacy as a military power.	1
ClaimBuster	19875				Even President Nixon, because he was a strong leader at least, worked with a Democratic Congress very well.	1
ClaimBuster	19876				I fought hard from my days in the Senate and as vice president to cut the welfare rolls and we've moved millions of people in America into good jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	19877				This is a invasion of drugs from all over the world.	0
ClaimBuster	19878				But I believe it would have been much more unfair to have had John Anderson denied the right to participate in this debate.	1
ClaimBuster	19879				I have a direct relationship with hundreds of people around - hundreds of thousands around the country who actively campaign for me.	1
ClaimBuster	19880				First of all, I think it's important for Governor Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	19881				You've already spent $45 million scaring seniors and tearing me apart.	1
ClaimBuster	19882				I know that I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for the fact that this country gave me opportunity.	0
ClaimBuster	19883				I know the President's supposed to be replying to me, but sometimes, I have a hard time in connecting what he's saying, with what I have said or what my positions are.	0
ClaimBuster	19884				You thought it should have been 5,000 troops...	1
ClaimBuster	19885				Well, Jim, I believe that the Federal government should give people the tools and try to establish the conditions in which they can make the most of their own lives.	0
ClaimBuster	19886				That's not true in Connecticut, family income is down.	1
ClaimBuster	19887				4th in manufacturing jobs, 4th in the reduction of poverty, 4th in income increase.	1
ClaimBuster	19888				Uh - those uh programs were designed to help those who need it most.	0
ClaimBuster	19889				So my view is, sir, you have to increase investment, grow the economy and reduce the deficit by controlling health care costs, prudent reductions in defense, cuts in domestic programs and asking the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their fair share of taxes and investing and growing this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	19890				There are two very different issues here, and they've got to be dealt with separately.	0
ClaimBuster	19891				Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.	0
ClaimBuster	19892				The only people affected by my plan are the top income earners of America.	1
ClaimBuster	19893				When I was that far ahead, it was immediately following the Democratic Convention, and before the Republican Convention.	0
ClaimBuster	19894				I spent my life in the private sector.	1
ClaimBuster	19895				There is no policy of this government to give to the People's Republic, or to sell to the People's Republic of China, military equipment.	1
ClaimBuster	19896				The unemployment rate was less than 4 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	19897				We need a president who will lead on this issue, who has had experience on this issue.	0
ClaimBuster	19898				I vetoed it when they shut the government down.	1
ClaimBuster	19899				You didn't even have tax cuts in your budget, Mr. President, the first two years you were president.	1
ClaimBuster	19900				So we've got to get our education system right.	0
ClaimBuster	19901				Nobody touched that tar baby till the day after election in 1988 because they were flooding both parties with crooked PAC money, and it was in many cases stolen PAC money.	1
ClaimBuster	19902				Here they're leaving the skies and the environment behind.	0
ClaimBuster	19903				Yes, I voted for it, supported it.	1
ClaimBuster	19904				The African-American community -- because -- look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated.	0
ClaimBuster	19905				Let me just make it clear: I will never allow any country to have a veto over our security.	0
ClaimBuster	19906				We're now at under 285.	1
ClaimBuster	19907				And I want to tell you, they hate the Clintons, because what's happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace.	0
ClaimBuster	19908				And I think it's very important for the American president, as well as other Western leaders, to remind him of the great benefits of democracy, that democracy will best help the people realize their hopes and aspirations and dreams.	0
ClaimBuster	19909				It seems like they can't get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	19910				Is the senior citizen better off because inflation is not wiping out their family's savings?	0
ClaimBuster	19911				And it's an overall sign of weakness.	0
ClaimBuster	19912				We are going to areas like Syria where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama.	1
ClaimBuster	19913				The Secretary of State admitted that this morning.	1
ClaimBuster	19914				The Soviet Union does understand strength.	0
ClaimBuster	19915				The democratic leaders of Central and Latin America want to work with us.	0
ClaimBuster	19916				American airplanes are helping today on humanitarian relief for Sarajevo.	1
ClaimBuster	19917				And I've noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born.	0
ClaimBuster	19918				This would take a lot of negotiation.	0
ClaimBuster	19919				Now, it ultimately is going to be up to the voters -- to you -- which path we should take.	0
ClaimBuster	19920				The same way the computer was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to figure out, for defense purposes, how to communicate, we've got to understand that this is a national security issue, as well.	1
ClaimBuster	19921				They are a tough and a ruthless adversary, and we must be prepared to meet that challenge, and I would.	0
ClaimBuster	19922				I have further strongly recommended that this administration do something it has not done, and that is to strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen the officials in this government that deal with undocumented workers, and to do so in a way that's responsible and within the Constitution of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	19923				I wanted a government that was smaller and less bureaucratic to help people make the most of their own lives.	0
ClaimBuster	19924				And I would come up with a game plan to deal with it.	0
ClaimBuster	19925				We need to do more than that.	0
ClaimBuster	19926				Senator Obama said the surge could not work, said it would increase sectarian violence, said it was doomed to failure.	1
ClaimBuster	19927				Well, I think Donald was about to say he's going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act.	0
ClaimBuster	19928				And the point that I originally made is that we took our eye off Afghanistan, we took our eye off the folks who perpetrated 9/11, they are still sending out videotapes and Senator McCain, nobody is talking about defeat in Iraq, but I have to say we are having enormous problems in Afghanistan because of that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	19929				This war is a long, long war, and it requires steadfast determination and it requires a complete understanding that we not only chase down Al Qaida but we disrupt terrorist safe havens as well as people who could provide the terrorists with support.	0
ClaimBuster	19930				I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors.	0
ClaimBuster	19931				You have to allow people to transfer property, which is why I'm for partnership rights and so forth.	0
ClaimBuster	19932				We need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet.	0
ClaimBuster	19933				It's who makes the decision, who makes this very difficult, very wrenching decision?	0
ClaimBuster	19934				I was on my peroration.	0
ClaimBuster	19935				That's not fair for our future.	0
ClaimBuster	19936				I've served under a number of presidents.	1
ClaimBuster	19937				He misled the American people when he said we'd go to war as a last resort.	0
ClaimBuster	19938				And we formed a historic coalition, and we brought him down, and we destroyed the 4th largest army.	1
ClaimBuster	19939				And you know why he gets that count?	0
ClaimBuster	19940				So we've got to get it under control and there's one last point I'd make.	0
ClaimBuster	19941				But it will cover preexisting conditions.	1
ClaimBuster	19942				And we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it.	1
ClaimBuster	19943				We're starting to see gains in math and science.	1
ClaimBuster	19944				And as Americans, our generation should protect this wonderful land for our children.	0
ClaimBuster	19945				Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.	0
ClaimBuster	19946				Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS.	1
ClaimBuster	19947				The oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare.	1
ClaimBuster	19948				But the important thing is, what are we going to do now.	0
ClaimBuster	19949				It's been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.	1
ClaimBuster	19950				I want to end the tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and provide a tax credit for every company that's creating a job right here in America.	0
ClaimBuster	19951				The government needs to be well-managed, efficient, economical, We need to have a government that's sensitive to our people's needs - to those who are poor, who don't have adequate health care, who have been cheated too long with our tax programs, who've been out of jobs, whose families have been torn apart.	0
ClaimBuster	19952				I think, to close out this discussion, it would be better to put into perspective what we're talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	19953				It - it was a very uh - because of the defeat of teacher salaries, it was not a bill that uh - met in my opinion the need.	0
ClaimBuster	19954				[Laughter] And yet, that's the most important single issue of our time.	0
ClaimBuster	19955				The intelligence-gathering and the law-enforcement arms of the FBI just couldn't share intelligence under the old law.	1
ClaimBuster	19956				And any objective observer has said it's not true.	0
ClaimBuster	19957				I see what it does.	0
ClaimBuster	19958				The right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective?	0
ClaimBuster	19959				I want a country where people are coming together across the lines of race and region and income.	0
ClaimBuster	19960				I don't believe we should move to a cold-war relationship.	0
ClaimBuster	19961				These are the kinds of efforts worked on a joint basis with community leaders, particularly in the minority areas of the central cities that have been deteriorating so rapidly in the past.	0
ClaimBuster	19962				The good news is (inaudible).	0
ClaimBuster	19963				I think also that pulling our missile defense program out of Poland in the way we did was also unfortunate in terms of, if you will, disrupting the relationship in some ways that existed between us.	0
ClaimBuster	19964				The tax increase I have proposed triggers in at family incomes of $200,000 and above.	1
ClaimBuster	19965				The Soviets take out more than we do and the principle of intrusive verification.	0
ClaimBuster	19966				There's no question about that.	0
ClaimBuster	19967				In that interview uh - Governor Carter indicated that uh - he would raise the taxes on those in the medium or middle-income brackets or higher.	1
ClaimBuster	19968				On the other hand we found that the bill got into the legislative difficulties and consequently no action was taken.	1
ClaimBuster	19969				Are we better off when we load our children with this fantastic debt?	0
ClaimBuster	19970				This was a trick on the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	19971				Yes, we have to be steadfast and resolved, and I am.	0
ClaimBuster	19972				It's about selecting a president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	19973				Now it's true that we disagree on this.	1
ClaimBuster	19974				Are you for what the Supreme Court says is a constitutional way of having affirmative action?	0
ClaimBuster	19975				Probably never heard of him.	0
ClaimBuster	19976				When you go to bed tonight, look at your children.	0
ClaimBuster	19977				So, what -- what we need to do with respect to the Middle East is strong, steady leadership, not wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map.	0
ClaimBuster	19978				They oppose mine because they don't want to get Medicare involved because they're afraid that Medicare will negotiate lower prices for seniors who currently pay the highest prices of all.	1
ClaimBuster	19979				Thank you for your question.	0
ClaimBuster	19980				We had a better idea.	0
ClaimBuster	19981				Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they don't pass it: Is the program so critical it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it?	0
ClaimBuster	19982				We came from 100 different corners of the earth.	0
ClaimBuster	19983				So across the board, we are engaging them in building capacity in these countries.	0
ClaimBuster	19984				All of those things will make a difference, so the point is the commitments I've made, I've kept.	1
ClaimBuster	19985				Let's try to expand our markets abroad.	0
ClaimBuster	19986				"We've got to show that we've got good habits, because if we're running up trillion dollar debts that we're passing on to the next generation, then a lot of people are going to think, ""Well, you know what?"	0
ClaimBuster	19987				I said that one day and Pat Moynihan, a Democrat, say, no, he said, in the history of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	19988				It's a great honor for me to be here standing here as the Republican nominee.	0
ClaimBuster	19989				Now, we have a big difference on this.	0
ClaimBuster	19990				I want to make sure that regulators see their job as encouraging small business, not crushing it.	0
ClaimBuster	19991				I traveled all over the world looking at the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, Joe Lieberman and I.	1
ClaimBuster	19992				And presidential leadership that I want to provide in this area will bring it down, but we've got to get the Democrats - Congress under control.	0
ClaimBuster	19993				I will -- I pledge to you I will do whatever is necessary to make sure that it stays that way.	0
ClaimBuster	19994				I believe in local control of governments, and obviously if they don't there needs to be a consequence at the federal level.	0
ClaimBuster	19995				But it seems to me the kids ought to -- if they've started, they ought to stop and just don't do it.	0
ClaimBuster	19996				He has never been involved in this campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	19997				What counts is, that the United States celebrated its 200th birthday on July fourth.	1
ClaimBuster	19998				Now, have to be other factors involved for me to want to be involved.	0
ClaimBuster	19999				You'll have hospital and providers that'll no longer accept Medicare patients.	0
ClaimBuster	20000				I thought that was a good model.	0
ClaimBuster	20001				You cannot lead an alliance if you say, you know, you're going alone.	0
ClaimBuster	20002				Our military is the strongest military in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	20003				And you know, Hillary, what you should have done, you should have changed the law when you were a United States senator...	0
ClaimBuster	20004				A few uh - months ago, or I should say, maybe two years ago, the Soviet Union looked like they had continued strength in the Middle East.	1
ClaimBuster	20005				And John tells us that first, we've got to reduce spending before we can reduce taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	20006				It called for an increase in the production of energy in the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	20007				I don't suggest that, I don't support it.	0
ClaimBuster	20008				That's what my campaign is all about and that's what it'll continue to be all about.	0
ClaimBuster	20009				I made a mistake because I couldn't have foreseen these circumstances and this is the best deal we can work out at the time.	0
ClaimBuster	20010				And so -- on the logging issue.	0
ClaimBuster	20011				And so my question is...	0
ClaimBuster	20012				And they know that I'll take care of them.	0
ClaimBuster	20013				I would not use American ground forces in Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	20014				But I have spent my whole life serving this country.	1
ClaimBuster	20015				But I hope we can talk about what we're going to do in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	20016				I think it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm going to do.	1
ClaimBuster	20017				But he's going to get a half-a-trillion dollars more over the next five years that he can use for additional programs, or hopefully, someplace down the line, balancing the budget.	0
ClaimBuster	20018				We've cut our oil imports to the lowest level in two decades because we've developed oil and natural gas.	1
ClaimBuster	20019				It's not my term, it's the president's own Secretary of Defense, called them devastating.	1
ClaimBuster	20020				I am not gonna raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs.	0
ClaimBuster	20021				Nowadays - 75 percent were for Israel before.	1
ClaimBuster	20022				You know people who've lost their jobs and lost their homes?	0
ClaimBuster	20023				We sent up a good bill on clean water, a sound bill on clean water.	0
ClaimBuster	20024				All I said, that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing.	0
ClaimBuster	20025				And we never picked him up on that and did what was necessary to transfer authority and to transfer reconstruction.	1
ClaimBuster	20026				I think that we should move step-by-step toward universal health coverage, but I am not in favor of government doing it all.	0
ClaimBuster	20027				But I want to get out there and give a better education opportunity to all of our children and that's why I vetoed the budget you passed with $30 billion in education cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	20028				I said something the other day where I was accused of being like Joe McCarthy because I questioned -- I put it this way; I think it's wrong to demonstrate against your own country or organize demonstrations against your own country in foreign soil.	0
ClaimBuster	20029				Now, what I've said is we should end this war responsibly.	0
ClaimBuster	20030				Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that's going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have.	0
ClaimBuster	20031				I think most Americans would say that doesn't make sense.	0
ClaimBuster	20032				And when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are doing well, and you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now, I think that is a continuation of the last eight years, and we can't afford another four.	1
ClaimBuster	20033				But number five, the other thing that we have to do is recognize that we can't continue to do nation building in these regions.	0
ClaimBuster	20034				And now there's 30 nations involved, standing side by side with our American troops.	1
ClaimBuster	20035				And I think it's time you take a stand...	0
ClaimBuster	20036				K-2 diagnostic testing so we know whether or not there's a deficiency.	0
ClaimBuster	20037				Indeed, we had to borrow $17 billion to pay the checks.	1
ClaimBuster	20038				Well, let me say, first of all, in February Senator Dole acknowledged that the American economy was in the best shape it's been in in 30 years.	1
ClaimBuster	20039				I was talking about Mr. Ford.	1
ClaimBuster	20040				That's $1 -- that's $1 for every $15 you've cut.	1
ClaimBuster	20041				I said we would change the way welfare works, and even before the bill passed we'd moved nearly two million people from welfare to work, working with states and communities.	1
ClaimBuster	20042				Seniors now understand that the promise made will be a promise kept, but younger workers now understand we better have a government that trusts them and that's exactly what I'm going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	20043				And you really have to pay attention to words.	0
ClaimBuster	20044				They determined it was medically safe for the women who use that drug.	1
ClaimBuster	20045				This is a - a gross waste of money, so tough, competent management of government, giving us a simple efficient purposeful and manageable government would be a great step forward and if I'm elected - and I intend to be - then it's gonna be done.	0
ClaimBuster	20046				We have to see the facts before we can draw conclusions.	0
ClaimBuster	20047				We can't shortchange those things.	0
ClaimBuster	20048				I am very concerned about it.	0
ClaimBuster	20049				Well, there are various elements of defense.	0
ClaimBuster	20050				What is more moral in foreign policy than for the administration to take the lead in the World Food Conference in Rome in 1974 when the United States committed six million metric tons of food - over 60 percent of the food committed for the disadvantaged and underdeveloped nations of the world?	1
ClaimBuster	20051				Not on their defending some minority opinion on the right or the left.	0
ClaimBuster	20052				What we've done is organize the international community, saying Assad has to go.	1
ClaimBuster	20053				I believe strongly that the federal government can help, we need to fund Headstart.	0
ClaimBuster	20054				The Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund.	1
ClaimBuster	20055				"My opponent at one time said, ""Well, get me elected, I'll have them out of there in six months."""	1
ClaimBuster	20056				And, you know, the Bush administration has come to recognize that it hasn't worked, this notion that we are simply silent when it comes to our enemies.	0
ClaimBuster	20057				And, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald.	1
ClaimBuster	20058				But I'm not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people.	0
ClaimBuster	20059				Coming from the political process.	0
ClaimBuster	20060				I think the Head Start program is a great program.	0
ClaimBuster	20061				I went to a school in Dade County, Florida where the facilities are so overcrowded the children have to eat lunch in shifts with the first shift for lunch starting at 9:30 in the morning.	1
ClaimBuster	20062				Well another thing we can do.	0
ClaimBuster	20063				Their aspirations are similar to young people's here.	0
ClaimBuster	20064				unemployment, the cities are all very important issues, but they pale into insignificance in the life and duties of a President when compared with the control of nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	20065				In my health care bill, I said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who is insured.	1
ClaimBuster	20066				In 1990, there was a vast coalition put together to run Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait.	1
ClaimBuster	20067				I hope we can economize elsewhere so that we don't have to.	0
ClaimBuster	20068				And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.	0
ClaimBuster	20069				And so I believe the answer is, I'm going to win it because I'm getting into focus my agenda for America's renewal, and also I think that Governor Clinton's had pretty much of a free ride.	0
ClaimBuster	20070				And the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state.	0
ClaimBuster	20071				You know several states now are letting people vote over three weeks.	1
ClaimBuster	20072				And that's what we've done over the last four years.	1
ClaimBuster	20073				Michael Dukakis has run for sheriff, and so has George Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	20074				For example, after my first trip abroad - abroad, I strongly recommended that we increase our exchange programs particularly as they related to exchange of persons of leaders in the labor field and in the information field.	1
ClaimBuster	20075				Is the guy out of work better off?	0
ClaimBuster	20076				Over the last 30 months, we've seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created.	1
ClaimBuster	20077				We come together both Republicans and Democrats.	0
ClaimBuster	20078				Secondly, Senator Dole, you voted against the crime bill that had the death penalty for drug kingpins in it.	1
ClaimBuster	20079				These are the kinds of elements of a national health insurance, important to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	20080				But the fact is that it has taken many turns which I think are unacceptable.	0
ClaimBuster	20081				And we've got a 35 percent unemployment rate in many areas of this country among construction workers.	1
ClaimBuster	20082				And there is an example.	0
ClaimBuster	20083				And I say that not as the Democratic standard-bearer, but as a citizen of the United States who is concerned about the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	20084				Well, one of the things that I tried to do was to make sure that everybody in the country who was under a managed care plan should at least have three choices of plans, and would have the right to get out without penalty every year.	1
ClaimBuster	20085				Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	20086				It encourages them to begin a war.	0
ClaimBuster	20087				My point is this: that once you do this - follow this course of action - of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return.	0
ClaimBuster	20088				But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.	1
ClaimBuster	20089				In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance.	0
ClaimBuster	20090				I know why jobs come and why they go.	0
ClaimBuster	20091				You haven't heard me mention this before, but we're getting close now and I think it's about time I start putting things in perspective.	0
ClaimBuster	20092				And most important, let's make education our highest priority so that every eight-year-old will be able to read, every 12-year-old can log onto the Internet, every 18-year-old can go to college.	0
ClaimBuster	20093				We have gone from the biggest deficits to the biggest surpluses.	1
ClaimBuster	20094				We both want to help the old people.	0
ClaimBuster	20095				But I will point out that I was called naive when I suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	20096				We're consuming 50 percent of the world's cocaine.	1
ClaimBuster	20097				There's no doubt it√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s gonna affect our budgets.	0
ClaimBuster	20098				"He said, ""It's not what he doesn't know that bothers me; it's what he knows for sure that just ain't so.''"	0
ClaimBuster	20099				I don't know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in America.	0
ClaimBuster	20100				But when a man who hopes to be President says, take this treaty, discard it, do not vote, do not debate, do not explore the issues, do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation - that is a very dangerous and disturbing thing.	0
ClaimBuster	20101				And therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	20102				A profound scientist recently made a different --	0
ClaimBuster	20103				First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico.	1
ClaimBuster	20104				I don't think he should say that our prestige is at an all-time low.	0
ClaimBuster	20105				He's a brave, brave man.	0
ClaimBuster	20106				We're raising money for the Republican Party, and we're doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so.	1
ClaimBuster	20107				I was in uh - thirty primaries in the spring, and uh - at first it was obvious that I didn't have any standing in the poll.	1
ClaimBuster	20108				I've got a pen, and I'm going to veto every single spending bill that comes across my desk.	0
ClaimBuster	20109				It's not a matter of diplomacy or trade with me.	0
ClaimBuster	20110				She doesn't have the stamina.	0
ClaimBuster	20111				The rest either abstained or voted against us.	1
ClaimBuster	20112				But I support the death penalty in the most heinous cases.	0
ClaimBuster	20113				So what, what is in my plan and I think it's almost identical in Senator Dole's plans is we make more people eligible to save in an IRA and let couples, married couples save more and then they could withdraw from it tax-free if they needed to, for medical emergencies or buy a home or education, but they could also save to supplement retirement.	0
ClaimBuster	20114				I've been a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; I run for the presidency with full knowledge that his great responsibility, really, given to him by the Constitution and by the force of events, is in the field of foreign affairs.	1
ClaimBuster	20115				If we take your advice with respect to how we change our tax codes so that companies that earn profits overseas don't pay U.S. taxes compared to companies here that are paying taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	20116				But -- but it'll -- it'll -- it'll be...	0
ClaimBuster	20117				What I will do is permit people to buy into Medicaid.	0
ClaimBuster	20118				We didn't guard the nuclear facilities.	1
ClaimBuster	20119				I'm very pleased that the Fraternal Order of Police in Little Rock, Arkansas endorsed me because I think they see I'm trying to strengthen the anti-crime legislation.	1
ClaimBuster	20120				I agree with what he's talking about in trying to get this spending down and the discipline, although I think we ought to totally exempt Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	20121				And I think this is a record that uh - the American people understand and will appreciate.	0
ClaimBuster	20122				We've become very, very sloppy.	0
ClaimBuster	20123				Uh - we had last year a $65 billion deficit - the largest deficit in the history of our country - more of a deficit spending than we had in the entire eight-year period under President Johnson and President Kennedy.	1
ClaimBuster	20124				In 1974, we had a so-called oil shock, wherein the price of OPEC oil was raised to an extraordinary degree.	1
ClaimBuster	20125				I thought that was wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	20126				Mr. Perot says it's a bad deal.	1
ClaimBuster	20127				But are the American people?	0
ClaimBuster	20128				And the main point is, taxes have been cut, and yet income is up to the Federal Government by 25 percent in the last three years.	1
ClaimBuster	20129				He didn't honor the agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	20130				We will strengthen our intelligence-gathering services.	0
ClaimBuster	20131				The people of the United States individually could not have developed the Tennessee Valley; collectively they could have.	0
ClaimBuster	20132				Now, let me just share something.	0
ClaimBuster	20133				And he said our troops would be occupiers in a bitterly hostile land.	1
ClaimBuster	20134				And therefore, I think, we should make it very clear the disagreement between Mr. Nixon and myself.	0
ClaimBuster	20135				Under Governor Bush, Texas has sunk to be 50th out of 50 in health care -- in health insurance for their citizens.	1
ClaimBuster	20136				I'm not going to worry about it anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	20137				But we ought to stand staunch.	0
ClaimBuster	20138				And so it was a man down there in that area that this was delivered to, and he recognized that what was in that manual was in direct contravention of my own Executive order, in December of 1981, that we would have nothing to do with regard to political assassinations.	1
ClaimBuster	20139				It's possible to detect those kind of tests.	1
ClaimBuster	20140				I want to thank you for listening tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	20141				I will not cut our military budget.	0
ClaimBuster	20142				It requires testing of all new teachers, including in the subjects that they teach.	0
ClaimBuster	20143				And so we decimated Al Qaida's core leadership in the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan.	1
ClaimBuster	20144				Governor Clinton said, well, I might have been with the minority, let sanctions work -- but I guess I would have voted with the majority.	1
ClaimBuster	20145				Now, that I think has to be our policy, because they are threatening to kill more Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	20146				And you say Exxon and Mobil.	0
ClaimBuster	20147				But let me just first, Cheryl, if you will, I want to thank Charlie for moderating.	0
ClaimBuster	20148				And I say that because I know a lot of people that feel like we should just brush our hands and walk away.	0
ClaimBuster	20149				Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.	0
ClaimBuster	20150				Those of us who are proudly pro-life understand that.	0
ClaimBuster	20151				I would not ship that Arab country anything - no weapons, no spare parts for weapons, no oil-drilling rigs, no oil pipe, no nothing.	0
ClaimBuster	20152				It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	20153				"You cannot lead the war on terror if you keep changing positions on the war on terror and say things like, ""Well, this is just a grand diversion."""	0
ClaimBuster	20154				Over the next four years, we'll continue to rally the armies of compassion, to help heal the hurt that exists in some of our country's neighborhoods.	0
ClaimBuster	20155				Now there are other places where the executive can lead, but let me just sum up by saying this: why do I talk every time I'm in the South on civil rights?	0
ClaimBuster	20156				And despite the politics of it, I stand where I stand, and I think I'm right, and before this fight is over we're going to come up with a better bill, a more effective bill that does not undermine the liberties of our people.	0
ClaimBuster	20157				And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot.	1
ClaimBuster	20158				I'll just mention one -- the Beasley Academic Center in Chicago.	0
ClaimBuster	20159				My friend, I'd like you to see the letter that a group of senators and I wrote warning exactly of this crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	20160				America and Americans decide not just what's happening in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	20161				That's why I want to down the tax rates on small employers, big employers, so they want to be here.	0
ClaimBuster	20162				Now we have two major carrier task forces.	1
ClaimBuster	20163				"The word of the president of the United States is good enough for me."""	0
ClaimBuster	20164				But four years ago, I told the American people and I told you I would cut taxes for middle class families.	1
ClaimBuster	20165				That sense is something that I want to restore.	0
ClaimBuster	20166				But I'm feeling a little better tonight, and I'll tell you why.	0
ClaimBuster	20167				But I would go against them if she releases her e-mails.	0
ClaimBuster	20168				And that's exactly what it's done.	1
ClaimBuster	20169				But keep in mind this bill covers 5 percent of the employers, and 95 percent of the employers and all those employees they employ are not covered in this act.	1
ClaimBuster	20170				What I will do as president is make sure it's more attractive to come to America again.	0
ClaimBuster	20171				I mean, I'm -- I'm pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the Iranians to end their nuclear program.	0
ClaimBuster	20172				Look, over the last eight years, this administration, along with Senator McCain, have been solely focused on Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	20173				I flew a combat mission, my last one was over Manila.	1
ClaimBuster	20174				And I would hope that we would give to women in this country the right to make that decision, and to make it in the exercise of their conscience and religious beliefs.	0
ClaimBuster	20175				We find that the Soviet Union is a very primitive economy.	0
ClaimBuster	20176				So I really don't think so.	0
ClaimBuster	20177				The goal of the sanctions was not to remove Saddam Hussein, it was to remove the weapons of mass destruction.	1
ClaimBuster	20178				I mean, what kind of judgment-I mean, jumping all over the president on his decision on one area of farm policy.	0
ClaimBuster	20179				This election is not about debating tricks, it is about your future.	0
ClaimBuster	20180				But isn't the real question that we have to answer not how many exceptions we make, because the vice president himself is prepared to make exceptions.	0
ClaimBuster	20181				I don't think that uh - America can go on a big spending spree with a whole lot of new programs uh - that would add significantly to the federal budget.	0
ClaimBuster	20182				We don't know whether he's developing weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	20183				With her, it's all talk and no action.	0
ClaimBuster	20184				Now as far as the No Child Left Behind is concerned, it was a great first beginning in my view.	0
ClaimBuster	20185				Reduce the White House staff by a 3rd after or at the same time the Congress does the same thing for their staff.	0
ClaimBuster	20186				Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position.	1
ClaimBuster	20187				Maybe there is no hacking.	0
ClaimBuster	20188				It's not trickle down economics.	0
ClaimBuster	20189				As soon as she releases them, I will release.	0
ClaimBuster	20190				The mistake that both parties made in Washington with the S&L business was deregulating them without proper capital requirements, proper oversight and regulation, proper training of the executives.	1
ClaimBuster	20191				I've spent my life creating jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	20192				We need to call upon Syria to release the three Israeli soldiers who have been captured.	0
ClaimBuster	20193				There is a woman named Winifred Skinner here tonight from Iowa.	1
ClaimBuster	20194				I'm going to change that.	0
ClaimBuster	20195				This lady said here, how have you been affected by the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	20196				This means at the secretary of state level and at the ambassadorial level.	0
ClaimBuster	20197				My -- my passion probably flows from the fact that I believe in God.	0
ClaimBuster	20198				I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about -- how long is it, Hillary, three months?	0
ClaimBuster	20199				We have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was.	1
ClaimBuster	20200				We have recommended that in the h- housing program we can reduce down payments and moderate monthly payments.	1
ClaimBuster	20201				These are unidentified people, and after the bomb goes off, they're blown to bits because they are suicidal individuals who think they're going to go to paradise if they perpetrate such an act and lose their life in doing it.	0
ClaimBuster	20202				The facts are you now have a government that comes at you.	0
ClaimBuster	20203				And the facts are facts and records are records.	0
ClaimBuster	20204				We preach in the Declaration of Independence and in the Constitution, in the statement of our greatest leaders, we preach very high standards; and if we're not going to be s- charged before the world with hypocrisy we have to meet those standards.	0
ClaimBuster	20205				We're going to say you have a five-year limit.	0
ClaimBuster	20206				It says let's give parents the choice of a public, private or public school -- public, private or religious school.	1
ClaimBuster	20207				And over the last summers I've flown over there.	1
ClaimBuster	20208				And that's the perspective I bring when I think about what's called entitlements.	0
ClaimBuster	20209				My opponent opposed the missile defenses.	1
ClaimBuster	20210				It would not be appropriate for me to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	20211				And one of the things that the Vice President either ignores or won't address is the fact that you can't divorce our military security from our economic security.	0
ClaimBuster	20212				That's why we've invested in solar and wind and biofuels, energy efficient cars.	1
ClaimBuster	20213				He was wrong about Russia when they committed aggression against Georgia.	0
ClaimBuster	20214				That's the reason why we have brought more cases against China for violating trade rules than the other -- the previous administration had done in two terms.	1
ClaimBuster	20215				those imports have been reduced.	1
ClaimBuster	20216				I think free trade is going to expand our job opportunity.	0
ClaimBuster	20217				But after 9/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it.	1
ClaimBuster	20218				We're going to have to prioritize, just like a family has to prioritize.	0
ClaimBuster	20219				We've had several fragmentary efforts by members of the Congress and by - by private citizens.	1
ClaimBuster	20220				And they recognize we got great difficulties, but they're also much more optimistic than the pessimists we have up here tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	20221				We're going to bring the $2.5 trillion...	0
ClaimBuster	20222				Yes, we got problems at home.	1
ClaimBuster	20223				And the reason I'm worried is because there's a vicious enemy that has an ideology of hate.	0
ClaimBuster	20224				And uh - that would be another factor that I would follow.	0
ClaimBuster	20225				And we're going to get the great entrepreneurial spirit of this country, and we're going to free ourselves from this dependency on Mideast oil.	0
ClaimBuster	20226				Many of you viewers don't know, but Laura and I sent our girls to public school.	1
ClaimBuster	20227				And I think that's a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	20228				I have met with the heads of government bilaterally as well as multilaterally.	1
ClaimBuster	20229				Under my plan, half of their costs would be paid right away.	0
ClaimBuster	20230				Today there are only three left including the one in Cuba.	1
ClaimBuster	20231				Most of the tax cuts went to low- and middle-income Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	20232				The president said he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through that full process.	1
ClaimBuster	20233				... go to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it.	1
ClaimBuster	20234				These problems are not easy.	0
ClaimBuster	20235				You are the ones who are making car payments and mortgage payments and doing right by your kids.	0
ClaimBuster	20236				How did we get on to Putin?	0
ClaimBuster	20237				I have to take ten seconds here at the end -- the red light isn't on yet -- to say to Ross Perot, please don't say to the DEA agents on the street that we don't have the will to fight drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	20238				They have too many employees.	0
ClaimBuster	20239				It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?	0
ClaimBuster	20240				Who has been the person who has tried to keep spending under control?	0
ClaimBuster	20241				That's the kind of exaggeration I was just talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	20242				We need to accelerate the drug approval process.	0
ClaimBuster	20243				And I give credit -- I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked.	0
ClaimBuster	20244				That's the difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	20245				I'm opposed to these policies as well.	0
ClaimBuster	20246				Actually, it's not an empty promise.	0
ClaimBuster	20247				Third, I think it's possible to gain a seven hundred million to a billion dollars through tax changes which I believe would close up loof- loopholes on dividend withholding, on expense accounts.	0
ClaimBuster	20248				Well, he doesn't like trickle down government but I think he's talking about the Reagan-Bush years where we created 15 million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	20249				First of all, Mr. Mondale should know that the President of the United States did not order the marines into that barracks.	1
ClaimBuster	20250				So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term?	0
ClaimBuster	20251				I was called the sheriff, by the -- one of the senior members of the Appropriations Committee.	1
ClaimBuster	20252				-- I couldn't agree with you more, couldn't agree with you more.	0
ClaimBuster	20253				And then you wouldn't have had them.	0
ClaimBuster	20254				I suggest you might consider somebody who's created jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	20255				The point I want to make to you is, a bipartisan commission reviewed my plan and the Bush plan and there were as many Republicans as Democratic health care experts on it.	1
ClaimBuster	20256				Is -- are Israel and the Palestinians closer to reaching a peace agreement?	0
ClaimBuster	20257				And most importantly, we give small business a 50 percent tax credit so that after we lower the costs of health care, they also get, whether they're self-employed or a small business, a lower cost to be able to cover their employees.	1
ClaimBuster	20258				But even before then the problem hits because the money contributed to Social Security this year is an entitlement.	0
ClaimBuster	20259				But I do point out that he's been wrong on many foreign policy and national security issues, which is supposed to be his strength.	0
ClaimBuster	20260				"Next thing I know, one of these ACT UP groups is out saying, ""Bush ought to change his behavior."""	0
ClaimBuster	20261				I said I did if administered fairly and justly.	0
ClaimBuster	20262				We did it without any of our allies that helped in the Gulf.	1
ClaimBuster	20263				If one vote per precinct had changed in 1960, John Kennedy would never have been President of this nation.	1
ClaimBuster	20264				Not only would it threaten Israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	20265				I haven't made a promise about...	0
ClaimBuster	20266				But I believe that all of us together, and I believe the Presidency is what Teddy Roosevelt said it was.	0
ClaimBuster	20267				We cannot turn the job over to anyone else.	0
ClaimBuster	20268				Well, I must say that the reason that the schools have been constructed is because the local school districts were willing to increase the property taxes to a tremendously high figure - in my opinion, almost to the point of diminishing returns in order to sustain these schools.	1
ClaimBuster	20269				And I just want to make my position absolutely clear with regard to getting intelligence information.	0
ClaimBuster	20270				First, with regard to Poland, when I talked to Mr. Gomulka, the present leader of Poland, for six hours in Warsaw last year, I learned something about their problems and particularly his.	1
ClaimBuster	20271				Are you afraid I couldn't hear him?	0
ClaimBuster	20272				And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.	0
ClaimBuster	20273				But we've got to do a lot better on education, and we have to do, be tougher on those who commit crimes.	0
ClaimBuster	20274				We have to keep Americans' taxes low.	0
ClaimBuster	20275				But in any event, I think we just look at the facts.	0
ClaimBuster	20276				Talk about the VA: We've increased VA funding by $22 billion in the four years since I've been president.	1
ClaimBuster	20277				We have seen the strongest economy in the history of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	20278				That's why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	20279				If the United States had not moved when we did in southern Africa, there's no doubt there would have been an acceleration of bloodshed in that tragic part of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	20280				Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.	0
ClaimBuster	20281				I really tried to be faithful to your request that we answer the questions specifically and pointedly.	0
ClaimBuster	20282				Of course it's OK to go across state lines because in Arizona they may offer a better plan that suits you best than it does here in Tennessee.	0
ClaimBuster	20283				But that was 10 years before you took office.	1
ClaimBuster	20284				...I would liquidate the industry.	0
ClaimBuster	20285				He cut if off, sort of arbitrarily.	1
ClaimBuster	20286				That has escalated now to sixteen and a half million dollars, in the last uh Republican administration.	1
ClaimBuster	20287				Now, it's hard to out-spend Congress but he tried to for the last 3 years.	1
ClaimBuster	20288				And, as a matter of fact, the previous administration stood by and so did I -- not that I could have done anything in my position at that time -- but for this revolution to take place.	1
ClaimBuster	20289				The first is, the difference is there is no new accountability measures in Vice President Gore's plan.	1
ClaimBuster	20290				I show how I pay for the health care, how we pay for the education.	0
ClaimBuster	20291				Last point about Senator McCain's plan is that insurers right now, the main restrictions on what they do is primarily state law and, under Senator McCain's plan, those rules would be stripped away and you would start seeing a lot more insurance companies cherry-picking and excluding people from coverage.	0
ClaimBuster	20292				Because we reduced the deficit four years in a row.	1
ClaimBuster	20293				And so everything we're doing, we're doing in consultation with our partners in the region, including Israel which obviously has a huge interest in seeing what happens in Syria; coordinating with Turkey and other countries in the region that have a great interest in this.	1
ClaimBuster	20294				I want to thank President Reagan for agreeing to debate.	0
ClaimBuster	20295				I would tighten those sanctions further.	0
ClaimBuster	20296				But they're matters that are ah - important.	0
ClaimBuster	20297				7.7 million elderly citizens who were living in the lowest 20 percent of earnings -- 7.7 million have moved up into another bracket since our administration took over, leaving only 5 million of the elderly in that bracket when there had been more than 13 million.	1
ClaimBuster	20298				But they see a compassionate, strong, great first lady in Laura Bush.	0
ClaimBuster	20299				But it's not OK with me, because based on what she's saying, and based on where she's going, and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day.	0
ClaimBuster	20300				That's what we've been going through for the last eight years.	0
ClaimBuster	20301				So, thank you for giving me a chance to straighten the record.	0
ClaimBuster	20302				The Clinton Foundation raised $30 million to help Haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had.	1
ClaimBuster	20303				So I think Mr. Perot was right in questioning the management practices.	1
ClaimBuster	20304				I voted for small-business tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	20305				It's understandable that a Senator in the preliminary debates can make an irresponsible statement, or, maybe, an ill-advised statement.	0
ClaimBuster	20306				We're the best fed; we're the best clothed, with a better distribution of this world's goods to all of our people than any people in history.	0
ClaimBuster	20307				I don't want the federal government making decisions on behalf of everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	20308				And I suspect he'll keep those too.	0
ClaimBuster	20309				I ran the Olympics and balanced the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	20310				I believe all senior citizens should be able to choose their own doctors and get prescription drugs from their own pharmacists with Medicare paying half the bill.	0
ClaimBuster	20311				This state became one of the top five in the nation for health care coverage for children under his leadership.	1
ClaimBuster	20312				We had a better idea.	0
ClaimBuster	20313				And I do advocate a pardon for - for draft evaders.	0
ClaimBuster	20314				You're talking about 2 different subjects.	1
ClaimBuster	20315				That's why I want to invest in you.	0
ClaimBuster	20316				Thank you, and that's an opportunity for me, and I appreciate it.	0
ClaimBuster	20317				Now, look, Americans are hurting tonight and they're angry and I understand that, and they want a new direction.	0
ClaimBuster	20318				That's why I'm asking for your vote and that's why I'm asking for another four years.	0
ClaimBuster	20319				If you cut the amount going in 1 out of every $6, then you have to cut the value of each check by 1 out of every $6 unless you come up with the money from somewhere else.	0
ClaimBuster	20320				The final point is that we can use this money that we save on these weapons to spend on things that we really need.	0
ClaimBuster	20321				If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.	0
ClaimBuster	20322				And then throughout the world appoint the best people we can get, ambassadors who can speak the language - no mere - not merely people who made a political contribution but who can speak the language.	0
ClaimBuster	20323				And that is: not just to keep freedom for ourselves but to extend it to all the world, to extend it to all the world because that is America's destiny.	0
ClaimBuster	20324				Well, Jim, I want to thank you, and I want to thank Governor Romney, because I think was a terrific debate, and I very much appreciate it.	0
ClaimBuster	20325				We can have serious differences about our health care policy, for example, John, because we do have a difference on health care policy, but we...	1
ClaimBuster	20326				I just don't like the way John Ashcroft has applied it, and we're going to change a few things.	0
ClaimBuster	20327				As far as Indochina was concerned, I stated over and over again that it was essential during that period that the United States make it clear that we would not tolerate Indochina falling under Communist domination.	1
ClaimBuster	20328				Look what's happening to McDonnell Douglas; even Boeing is losing market share -- because we let the Europeans spend $25-$40 billion on Airbus without an appropriate competitive response.	1
ClaimBuster	20329				Secondly, I don't have any litmus test.	0
ClaimBuster	20330				This has been a very successful effort.	0
ClaimBuster	20331				Let me just say one final example.	0
ClaimBuster	20332				Since the assassination of our best leaders in the '60's, since the Vietnam War, since Watergate, and because we need campaign finance reform.	0
ClaimBuster	20333				But I will tell you, I sat there...	0
ClaimBuster	20334				I thought it was a bad decision.	0
ClaimBuster	20335				So let's get the record straight.	0
ClaimBuster	20336				It means that Governor Romney...	0
ClaimBuster	20337				I said we'd refocus attention on those who actually attacked us on 9/11, and we have gone after Al Qaeda's leadership like never before and Osama bin Laden is dead.	0
ClaimBuster	20338				We have, to one-third of what it was.	1
ClaimBuster	20339				(Applause) But don't take it out of my time!	0
ClaimBuster	20340				Well, had we joined the Kyoto treaty, which I guess he's referring to, it would have cost America a lot of jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	20341				I want to leave money in your pocket.	0
ClaimBuster	20342				This is in our country, folks, the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	20343				We have millions of people that did it the right way.	1
ClaimBuster	20344				Those investments are what's going to help to make sure that we continue to lead this world economy, not just next year, but 10 years from now, 50 years from now, 100 years from now.	1
ClaimBuster	20345				The special Federal commission made good solid recommendations.	0
ClaimBuster	20346				I have a plan that's going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early.	0
ClaimBuster	20347				And I have been a secretary of state...	1
ClaimBuster	20348				Certainly education and training is crucial.	0
ClaimBuster	20349				I make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage.	0
ClaimBuster	20350				We want to know when we retaliate that we're retaliating with those who are responsible for the terrorist acts.	0
ClaimBuster	20351				So all of this is possible.	0
ClaimBuster	20352				And we've just got to make sure, before somebody thinks they're buying a product, that it works.	0
ClaimBuster	20353				And that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	20354				I served my country in Vietnam.	1
ClaimBuster	20355				Of course we're going to have to make some determination on this, and we're going to have to make it on the convention forces.	0
ClaimBuster	20356				The -- and I just fundamentally disagree.	0
ClaimBuster	20357				"This is the same thing we heard -- remember, I appeared on ""Meet the Press"" with Tim Russert in 1990-something."	1
ClaimBuster	20358				I am not going to make the decision as to what the tactics could be, but obviously there are a number of areas in the world that are of importance to us.	0
ClaimBuster	20359				It was the right decision.	0
ClaimBuster	20360				Number 4, we would fully fund the Head Start program to get little kids off to a good start.	0
ClaimBuster	20361				A brown field is an abandoned industrial site that just sits idle in some of our urban centers.	1
ClaimBuster	20362				So nobody is more concerned about their safety and security than I am.	0
ClaimBuster	20363				And I think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference.	0
ClaimBuster	20364				There are challenges around the world that are new and different and there will be different -- we will be talking about countries sometime in the future that we hardly know where they are on the map, some Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	20365				We've been through a lot together as a country -- been through a recession, corporate scandals, war.	0
ClaimBuster	20366				You talk about somebody strong.	1
ClaimBuster	20367				Because by his own budget numbers, his proposals for spending on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy are more than the new spending proposals that he has made for health care and education and national defense all combined.	1
ClaimBuster	20368				Co-payments go up, costs go up, skyrocketing costs, which make people less and less able to afford health insurance in America.	1
ClaimBuster	20369				I don't want to stampede.	0
ClaimBuster	20370				But, of course, there's no way we can know whether any of that is true, because he hasn't released his tax returns.	1
ClaimBuster	20371				I think only if you're doing this -- and he's done it more than I have in terms of the presidency -- can you begin to get a sense of what it means to your families.	0
ClaimBuster	20372				It's called the Buffett rule.	1
ClaimBuster	20373				The result was that the Guatemalan people themselves eventually rose up and they threw him out.	1
ClaimBuster	20374				Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.	1
ClaimBuster	20375				We use people that get the position because they gave -- they made a campaign contribution and they're dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are.	0
ClaimBuster	20376				Where are companies going to go where they can create jobs and where they can do best in business?	0
ClaimBuster	20377				But I made the decision because I thought it was in the right interests of our security.	0
ClaimBuster	20378				He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.	1
ClaimBuster	20379				I apologize to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	20380				Number two, we have to work with cities and others to help generate economic growth in those communities -- through the Urban Development Action Grant Program.	0
ClaimBuster	20381				It didn't meet my test.	0
ClaimBuster	20382				I'm sure that we all accept and admire his commitment to his faith, and we are strengthened, all of us, by that fact.	0
ClaimBuster	20383				Who can give themselves a 23% pay raise anywhere in the world except Congress?	0
ClaimBuster	20384				I did everything I could to get General Motors to face its problems in the mid-'80s while it was still financially strong.	1
ClaimBuster	20385				We have to be the strongest economic power in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	20386				And so I do believe that we have to consider it as part of our interests, our national interests, in intervening where possible.	0
ClaimBuster	20387				He is alive today because of the criminal justice system.	0
ClaimBuster	20388				I'm proud of the record of this Administration.	0
ClaimBuster	20389				Number three, we'd open the doors to college education to high school graduates without regard to income.	0
ClaimBuster	20390				They've only approved about 10% of the agenda I've helped to send up there.	1
ClaimBuster	20391				And the reason we could do that is because of our fantastic success in winning the Cold War.	0
ClaimBuster	20392				I am concerned about a tax on Muslims, for example, over there.	1
ClaimBuster	20393				Let me just take two seconds of my time because I'm the Commander-in-Chief to respond to one thing that was said.	1
ClaimBuster	20394				But we have work to do in this nation.	0
ClaimBuster	20395				It's also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims.	0
ClaimBuster	20396				Be a wonderful time for the Russians to step into the Balkans and convince Mr. Milosevic that it's in his best interest and his country's best interest to leave office.	0
ClaimBuster	20397				Jeremy, first of all, your future is bright.	0
ClaimBuster	20398				And you ask how -- how are we going to do that?	0
ClaimBuster	20399				And we uh - had the emperor of Japan here this uh - past year and the net result is Japan and the United States are working more closely together now than at any time in the history of our relationship.	1
ClaimBuster	20400				Governor Clinton clicked off the things -- he's going to take on insurance companies and bureaucracies.	0
ClaimBuster	20401				Since he's been in office, two and a half million more American people have lost their jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	20402				Dean Acheson, George Marshall were strong secretaries of uh - state - excuse me - state.	0
ClaimBuster	20403				I think the American people will make their own decisions on character and at a time when we have work to do and we need action I think they need to clearly understand the backgrounds of each person.	0
ClaimBuster	20404				They admit it's an issue.	1
ClaimBuster	20405				I'll have to get this out very fast.	0
ClaimBuster	20406				Now, they may blame other folks, but it's time to get somebody in Washington who is going to work with both Republicans and Democrats to get some positive things done when it comes to our seniors.	0
ClaimBuster	20407				Now, that is the issue.	0
ClaimBuster	20408				You got that fact wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	20409				Now, again, if I get up there, if you send me, we're going to have some blunt talks about this, and we're really going to get down in the trenches and say, is this one you want to talk about or fix, because talk won't do it, folks.	0
ClaimBuster	20410				Our analysis indicates that something in the magnitude of about one hundred fifty to two hundred thousand jobs would uh - be made available.	1
ClaimBuster	20411				Well, let me--I have to correct one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	20412				They get to choose -- and they'll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them.	0
ClaimBuster	20413				Germany and Japan spend around $30 billion a piece.	1
ClaimBuster	20414				I think we can do a better job.	0
ClaimBuster	20415				That's not the right course for us.	0
ClaimBuster	20416				Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued.	1
ClaimBuster	20417				And then, I mentioned it the other night, I think if there's a crisis, people are going to say, well, George Bush has taken us through some tough crises, and we trust him to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	20418				You'll still have choice of doctor.	1
ClaimBuster	20419				I believe we can do better.	0
ClaimBuster	20420				I don't believe that uh that Mr. Carter's been any more specific in this case than he has been on many other instances.	0
ClaimBuster	20421				Uh - We would hope to control the House, to get a majority in the House uh - in this election.	0
ClaimBuster	20422				We must make this next century the century of the individual.	0
ClaimBuster	20423				They must know, in other words, that it is national suicide if they begin anything.	0
ClaimBuster	20424				We've got to drill offshore, my friends, and we've got to do it now, and we can do it.	0
ClaimBuster	20425				You know, for a while he was a strong supporter of getting rid of Saddam Hussein.	1
ClaimBuster	20426				He's indicating that we should fight for these islands come what may because they are, in his words, in the area of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	20427				That's what I'd like them to know about me; that I've gotten up every day and worked for the American people and worked so that their children could have their dreams come true.	0
ClaimBuster	20428				I think we are today.	0
ClaimBuster	20429				"When they said, ""We're going to cut Planned Parenthood funding."""	1
ClaimBuster	20430				They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted.	0
ClaimBuster	20431				Let me take uh - South Korea as an example.	0
ClaimBuster	20432				That is not good for America's position in the world, and the world notices.	0
ClaimBuster	20433				But I am discussing the power the President has to grant pardons.	0
ClaimBuster	20434				I really don't need uh - Mr. Nixon to tell me about what my responsibilities are as a citizen.	0
ClaimBuster	20435				I have appointed one member to the Supreme Court: Sandra Day O'Connor.	1
ClaimBuster	20436				The truth is what good policy is based on.	0
ClaimBuster	20437				I also believe that it is -- one of the reasons we can't do it is we're overextended.	0
ClaimBuster	20438				That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work.	1
ClaimBuster	20439				Why do they have to say we're going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they're saying?	0
ClaimBuster	20440				I am not quoting myself.	0
ClaimBuster	20441				Two women, both of them probably in their mid- to late-50s, had just been laid off of their plant.	1
ClaimBuster	20442				I don't think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear.	0
ClaimBuster	20443				I will pay down the debt every year.	0
ClaimBuster	20444				But that's the good news.	0
ClaimBuster	20445				But understand, that was a tactic designed to contain the damage of the previous four years of mismanagement of this war.	0
ClaimBuster	20446				We are growing -- our last report came out -- and it's right around the 1 percent level.	1
ClaimBuster	20447				But this is an important issue.	0
ClaimBuster	20448				Median income is down $4,300 a family and 23 million Americans out of work.	1
ClaimBuster	20449				And what I would like to do is see the National Guard and Reserve be deployed differently here in our own country.	0
ClaimBuster	20450				It's not by trickle-down government, saying we're going to take more money from people and hire more government workers, raise more taxes, put in place more regulations.	0
ClaimBuster	20451				That's the kind of mindset that says sanctions were working.	0
ClaimBuster	20452				In my state, we're leading the country in private sector job growth.	1
ClaimBuster	20453				Mr. Nixon would add a guarantee to islands five miles off the coast of the re- Republic of China when he's never really protested the Communists seizing Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	20454				We want them to continue that.	0
ClaimBuster	20455				Now, everybody will faint in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	20456				And there, again, he sort of slid by the question.	0
ClaimBuster	20457				Do you want to fix the problem or sound-bite it?	0
ClaimBuster	20458				The other was could an administration change the tone in Washington, D.C. And I believe the answer is yes, otherwise I wouldn't be asking for your vote.	0
ClaimBuster	20459				It's time for a new look.	0
ClaimBuster	20460				And I don't know if I've been born again, but I know I was born into a Christian family.	1
ClaimBuster	20461				So, it's not a question of saying our budget is full of a lot of waste.	0
ClaimBuster	20462				I question - and I don't question his concern about the war in Vietnam.	0
ClaimBuster	20463				"Medicare -- the issue of Medicare used to be called ""Mediscare."""	1
ClaimBuster	20464				So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.	1
ClaimBuster	20465				This means that the average family income went up fifteen per cent in the Eisenhower years as against two per cent in the Truman years.	1
ClaimBuster	20466				More in August than July.	1
ClaimBuster	20467				But, what you can't do is spend $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military is not asking for, $5 trillion on tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	20468				So watch Ukraine, and let's make sure that we -- that the Ukrainians understand that we are their friend and ally.	0
ClaimBuster	20469				I want every family to have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care.	0
ClaimBuster	20470				I believe he will go.	0
ClaimBuster	20471				You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.	1
ClaimBuster	20472				Under my plan I will put Medicare in an iron clad lockbox and prevent the money from being used for anything other than Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	20473				If - Iran is not an Arab country, as you know, it is a Moslem country - but if Saudi Arabia should declare an oil embargo against us, then I would consider that an economic declaration of war.	1
ClaimBuster	20474				I'm a product of a public school.	1
ClaimBuster	20475				Thirdly, I believe that India represents a great area for affirmative action by the free world.	0
ClaimBuster	20476				And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	20477				We've made progress in Northern Ireland, in the Middle East.	1
ClaimBuster	20478				And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see.	0
ClaimBuster	20479				That's what my mission will be in the presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	20480				And they have managed, in spite of all of our attempts at arms limitation, to go forward with the biggest military build-up in the history of man.	1
ClaimBuster	20481				They're hurting, and they're angry.	0
ClaimBuster	20482				There's no way you can pay for that five year, $40 billion tax cut for the rich and still buy all those weapons systems you want to buy unless you raid the Social Security Trust Fund.	0
ClaimBuster	20483				I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers.	1
ClaimBuster	20484				So as we phase these industries over, there's a whole of intellectual talent in these industries.	0
ClaimBuster	20485				And finally, he says we ought to have a summit.	0
ClaimBuster	20486				You know, so one of your liberal friends.	0
ClaimBuster	20487				And the Taliban are no longer in power.	1
ClaimBuster	20488				Well, first let me say with respect to the freeze, that back in the spring of 1982 Mr. Bush was a lot more sympathetic to the freeze than he seems to be today.	0
ClaimBuster	20489				Social Security and Medicare are entirely different in terms of the financial stabilities.	1
ClaimBuster	20490				This permits them to maintain their self-respect.	0
ClaimBuster	20491				And you know, according to my mother and my wife and my daughter, this world would be a lot better place if women were running it most of the time.	0
ClaimBuster	20492				It's going up at numbers that nobody's ever seen worldwide.	1
ClaimBuster	20493				I think it's worthy for a follow-up.	0
ClaimBuster	20494				And we can do it in an environmentally sound way.	0
ClaimBuster	20495				The Earned Income Tax Credit, sorry.	0
ClaimBuster	20496				That's why on day one, i will label them a currency manipulator, which allows us to apply tariffs where they're taking jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	20497				Because we have so mismanaged our country over the years, and it is now time to pay the fiddler.	0
ClaimBuster	20498				As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree.	0
ClaimBuster	20499				We have a four trillion dollar debt, and only in America would you finance seventy percent of it five years or less.	1
ClaimBuster	20500				I'm going to cut regulations.	0
ClaimBuster	20501				People need to remember: Six months prior to my arrival, the stock market started to go down.	1
ClaimBuster	20502				"The Clear Skies bill that he just talked about, it's one of those Orwellian names you pull out of the sky, slap it onto something, like ""No Child Left Behind"" but you leave millions of children behind."	0
ClaimBuster	20503				Yes, I'd be glad to.	0
ClaimBuster	20504				You're going to be paying for it.	0
ClaimBuster	20505				It is one that will continue to be a problem for years to come.	0
ClaimBuster	20506				Because the economy was on the verge of collapse, because we were about to go through the worst recession since the Great Depression, as a consequence of some of the same policies that Governor Romney's now promoting.	1
ClaimBuster	20507				Those things would help a great deal with the cities, but we still have a - a very serious problem there.	0
ClaimBuster	20508				It was rather a vague statement that they finally made.	0
ClaimBuster	20509				Governors like me and others have been trying to deal with the consequences.	0
ClaimBuster	20510				Right from the bottom up, the American people have got to say they want it.	0
ClaimBuster	20511				Mr Bush sent two people in secret to toast the Chinese leaders and basically tell them not to worry about it.	1
ClaimBuster	20512				One works for the family, and one works to pay taxes for the government.	0
ClaimBuster	20513				And with respect to this pipeline that Governor Romney keeps on talking about, we've -- we've built enough pipeline to wrap around the entire earth once.	1
ClaimBuster	20514				I mean, these aren't make-up figures.	1
ClaimBuster	20515				I think that grows the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	20516				That answer was about as clear as Boston harbor.	0
ClaimBuster	20517				Let's give them a real choice, the kind of choice you had, and the kind of choice a lot of people have in America.	0
ClaimBuster	20518				And so what I've said is that there's been some missed opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	20519				Are we as strong as we should be?	0
ClaimBuster	20520				And it's paid for, and I'll tell you how I'll pay for it.	0
ClaimBuster	20521				Anytime you think you want to legalize drugs, go to a neonatal unit -- if you can get in.	0
ClaimBuster	20522				That's what I've been critical about the administration for.	0
ClaimBuster	20523				But this is locker room talk.	0
ClaimBuster	20524				Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	20525				That's why I said to Afghanistan: If you harbor a terrorist, you're just as guilty as the terrorist.	1
ClaimBuster	20526				I believe that the free enterprise system is the greatest engine of prosperity the world's ever known.	0
ClaimBuster	20527				And so I simply do not think we should go back to the isolation days and starting blaming foreigners.	0
ClaimBuster	20528				People around the world with accredited degrees in science and math get a green card stapled to their diploma, come to the U.S. of A.	1
ClaimBuster	20529				We can have filters on Internets where public money is spent.	0
ClaimBuster	20530				In view of the difficulties we've had with the islands, in view of the difficulties and disputes we've had with Chiang Kai-shek, that's the only position we can take.	0
ClaimBuster	20531				Number one, we do need to expand domestic production and that means, for example, telling the oil companies the 68 million acres that they currently have leased that they're not drilling, use them or lose them.	1
ClaimBuster	20532				But they have to pay up.	0
ClaimBuster	20533				On our last television debate, I pointed out that it was my position that Americans must choose the best man that either party could produce.	1
ClaimBuster	20534				Well, but there is no -- but there is no evidence -- but there is...	0
ClaimBuster	20535				And it's important that we do have a good relation, because that enables me to better comment to him, and to better to discuss with him, some of the decisions he makes.	0
ClaimBuster	20536				And they're interested in what you're interested in.	0
ClaimBuster	20537				And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress.	0
ClaimBuster	20538				I believe we can meet the problems within the cities of this country and still uh - give a tax reduction.	0
ClaimBuster	20539				Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester.	0
ClaimBuster	20540				But unfortunately, in -- nowhere in the world is America's influence greater today than it was four years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	20541				I'm just as sick as you are by having to wake up and figure out how to defend myself every day.	0
ClaimBuster	20542				And that means we can't provide health care to people who need it.	0
ClaimBuster	20543				Now let me correct one other comment that uh - Governor Carter has made.	0
ClaimBuster	20544				But they always blame Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	20545				"Not a message a commander in chief gives, or this is a ""great diversion."""	0
ClaimBuster	20546				He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.	1
ClaimBuster	20547				You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them.	0
ClaimBuster	20548				We all fight over how much money is there.	0
ClaimBuster	20549				The issue of our natural resources; the right of posterity to inherit the earth, and what kind of earth will it be?	0
ClaimBuster	20550				In May of this year, Governor Carter took the first initiative, approximately twelve months after I had taken my initiative a year ago.	1
ClaimBuster	20551				I believe that we can work together.	0
ClaimBuster	20552				I have always opposed drawing a line.	1
ClaimBuster	20553				I haven't sorted out the penalties.	0
ClaimBuster	20554				And the only difference between me and any other businessman that has the range of businesses that I have is I haven't had that many lawsuits.	1
ClaimBuster	20555				But more importantly, we've reformed the system to make sure that we solve problems early, before they're too late.	0
ClaimBuster	20556				I'd get rid of it.	0
ClaimBuster	20557				We share a common border with another nation.	1
ClaimBuster	20558				There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.	0
ClaimBuster	20559				That's how it's going to be paid for, but we don't know the details.	0
ClaimBuster	20560				They can be carried out underground, they c- could be carried on in outer space.	1
ClaimBuster	20561				And so I have great confidence in him.	0
ClaimBuster	20562				America is at peace and with freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	20563				The US came together as we haven't in many, many years.	0
ClaimBuster	20564				At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president.	1
ClaimBuster	20565				I don't know what affirmative access means.	0
ClaimBuster	20566				But I would make the effort because I think the fate not only of our own civilization, but I think the fate of world and the future of the human race is involved in preventing a nuclear war.	0
ClaimBuster	20567				That's how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world.	1
ClaimBuster	20568				Senator Kennedy also indicated with regard to Cuba that he thought that I had made a mistake when I was in Cuba in not calling for free elections in that country.	1
ClaimBuster	20569				I'm happy to answer the question.	0
ClaimBuster	20570				I hope it√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s about wealthy people.	0
ClaimBuster	20571				Well, in the first place, I believe that character is a part of being president.	0
ClaimBuster	20572				She asked a question, I think, is whether the health care profession was to blame.	0
ClaimBuster	20573				And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened.	1
ClaimBuster	20574				This is a relevant question here tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	20575				This manual -- several thousands of which were produced -- was distributed, ordering political assassinations, hiring of criminals, and other forms of terrorism.	1
ClaimBuster	20576				Let me just talk to you about one of the short-term fixes.	0
ClaimBuster	20577				And yet he tells you he's for a middle- class tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	20578				We want to see that they do have adequate medical care.	0
ClaimBuster	20579				Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.	0
ClaimBuster	20580				Some desperate child needs to have somebody put their arm around them and say, we love you.	0
ClaimBuster	20581				How strong is our economy?	0
ClaimBuster	20582				And tomorrow night on NBC, from 10:30 to 11 Eastern, we're going to talk about how you pay the debt down, so we're going to come right down to that one.	1
ClaimBuster	20583				I did not support the war in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	20584				And you shouldn't have to apologize for wanting to keep all you can of it.	0
ClaimBuster	20585				They just need the help to be trained.	0
ClaimBuster	20586				One of the big differences between Senator Dole and myself is that I told you how I'm going to pay for every penny of the tax cuts I recommend and we've worked hard to bring this deficit down and that's helped people in the real estate business because the interest rates are lower.	1
ClaimBuster	20587				We're blessed with terrific soldiers, and extraordinary technology and intelligence.	0
ClaimBuster	20588				No prescription drug benefits, no drug therapy, no preventative medicines, no vision care.	0
ClaimBuster	20589				or 15 months ago, on what he believed in.	0
ClaimBuster	20590				I think we ought to raise the age at which a juvenile can carry a handgun from 18 to 21.	0
ClaimBuster	20591				He's been in office two years, and there has been absolutely no progress made toward a new SALT agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	20592				Mr. Bush has been critical of me for that, but I think those are the kinds of tough choices you have to make.	0
ClaimBuster	20593				Now, here's what I believe.	0
ClaimBuster	20594				You've proposed an approach that has a...	0
ClaimBuster	20595				And if we do that, then we have the ability to be able to respond more rapidly.	0
ClaimBuster	20596				At the last debate, we heard Donald talking about what he did to women.	1
ClaimBuster	20597				I wouldn't deal with Arafat, because I felt like he had let the former president down, and I don't think he's the kind of person that can lead toward a Palestinian state.	0
ClaimBuster	20598				And they provide us energy and they provide us innovation and they start companies like Intel and Google.	1
ClaimBuster	20599				We've got to be a nation blessed with a defense capability that's efficient, tough, capable, well organized, narrowly focused - fighting capability.	0
ClaimBuster	20600				I'll give you an example.	0
ClaimBuster	20601				And I think it's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.	0
ClaimBuster	20602				And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.	0
ClaimBuster	20603				Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place.	0
ClaimBuster	20604				And in his short career, he does not understand our national security challenges.	0
ClaimBuster	20605				The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.	0
ClaimBuster	20606				In ruling out the defense of Korea, they invited aggression in that area.	0
ClaimBuster	20607				Any proposals that I made at that time were at the request of the chairman, a Democrat, of one of the leading committees, who said we have to do something before the program goes broke and the checks bounce.	1
ClaimBuster	20608				We have to obviously cut spending.	0
ClaimBuster	20609				The Soviet Union is still jamming Radio Free Europe - Radio - uh- uh - Radio Free Europe is being jammed.	1
ClaimBuster	20610				Governor Carter uh - brags about the unemployment during Democratic administrations and condemns the unemployment at the present time.	0
ClaimBuster	20611				When it comes to community colleges, we are setting up programs, including with Nassau Community College, to retrain workers, including young people who may have dropped out of school but now are getting another chance, training them for the jobs that exist right now.	1
ClaimBuster	20612				So we've -- we've seen progress even under Republican control of the House of Representatives.	0
ClaimBuster	20613				I have suggested that the president should be given other weapons to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strikes beyond the injunction provision of the Taft-Hartley Act.	1
ClaimBuster	20614				If we can't meet with our friends, I don't know how we're going to lead the world in terms of dealing with critical issues like terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	20615				Well, maybe we'll give three or three or four or five or something.	0
ClaimBuster	20616				We recognize that there are places of conflict in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	20617				And they want it because they've understood from the beginning that when we open doors, we're all stronger, just as we were at the Olympics.	0
ClaimBuster	20618				You're a cardiologist, it wouldn't affect you.	1
ClaimBuster	20619				Well, two leading national news networks have both said the president's characterization of my health-care plan is incorrect.	1
ClaimBuster	20620				Strength is imperative for peace, but the two must go hand in hand.	0
ClaimBuster	20621				We also have to make the economy fairer.	0
ClaimBuster	20622				If you've got health insurance through your employer, you can keep your health insurance, keep your choice of doctor, keep your plan.	1
ClaimBuster	20623				Was this really going to war as a last resort?	0
ClaimBuster	20624				Now, when it comes to the issue of the environment, this is one of the worst administrations in modern history.	0
ClaimBuster	20625				I would like the record to show the panelists that Ross Perot took the first shot at the press.	0
ClaimBuster	20626				I am questioning his judgment on these matters, or where he's coming from He has every right to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	20627				We don't have the S&L crisis anymore.	1
ClaimBuster	20628				We've turned the country upside down.	0
ClaimBuster	20629				I went for one tax increase and when I make a mistake I admit it.	1
ClaimBuster	20630				So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?	0
ClaimBuster	20631				We have provided humanitarian assistance and we are helping the opposition organize, and we're particularly interested in making sure that we're mobilizing the moderate forces inside of Syria.	1
ClaimBuster	20632				As a matter of fact, I visited Poland, Yugoslavia and Rumania to make certain that the people of those countries understood that the president of the United States and the people of the United are dedicated to their independence, their autonomy and their freedom.	1
ClaimBuster	20633				I don't think you should support the death penalty to seek revenge.	0
ClaimBuster	20634				There is a huge difference in this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	20635				That stands in stark contrast, by the way, to a man who is going to leave 50 million -- 50 million Americans out of tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	20636				The only point I want to make is this, that in order to make those tough decisions we have to know what our values are and who we're fighting for and what our priorities are and if we are spending $300 billion on tax cuts for people who don't need them and weren't even asking for them, and we are leaving out health care which is crushing on people all across the country, then I think we have made a bad decision and I want to make sure we're not shortchanging our long term priorities.	0
ClaimBuster	20637				There was a Communist dictator that we inherited from the previous Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	20638				We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want -- and President Obama and whoever was working on it -- they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies.	1
ClaimBuster	20639				As I look at Cuba today, I believe that we are following the right course, a course which is difficult but a course which under the circumstance is the only proper one which will see that the Cuban people get a chance to realize their aspirations of progress through freedom and that they get that with our cooperation with the other organi- of the states in the Organization of American States.	0
ClaimBuster	20640				And in terms of peace, we are on the right track.	0
ClaimBuster	20641				Whenever you get a large rally of 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 people, you're going to have some fringe peoples.	0
ClaimBuster	20642				It's being worked now in 1700 communities -- bypassed Congress on this one, Ross -- 1700 communities across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	20643				Uh - On the one hand, for example, he suggests that as far as his medical care program is concerned that that really isn't a problem because it's from Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	20644				"Human rights are not advanced when, at the same time, you then stand back and say, ""Whoops, we didn't know the gun was loaded,'' and you have another totalitarian power on your hands."	0
ClaimBuster	20645				Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage.	1
ClaimBuster	20646				But we have horrible deals.	0
ClaimBuster	20647				"I think mother ought to whisper to Johnny and to Susie, as they button their coats in the morning and leave for the classroom, ""Be sure to say a prayer before you start your day's work."""	0
ClaimBuster	20648				Mali has been taken over, the northern part of Mali by al-Qaeda type individuals.	1
ClaimBuster	20649				And as president, I will always respect everybody's right to practice religion as they choose -- or not to practice -- because that's part of America.	0
ClaimBuster	20650				But the point is it's going to have to be somebody who inspires trust and confidence.	0
ClaimBuster	20651				I know what that√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s like when an army is defeated.	0
ClaimBuster	20652				But I will tell you, she's all talk.	0
ClaimBuster	20653				It won't take miracles and it won't happen overnight, but we can do much, much better if we have the courage to change.	0
ClaimBuster	20654				All of these things we can do as Americans and we can take on this mission and we can overcome it.	0
ClaimBuster	20655				But, you should pay attention to this campaign, because Governor Romney has made some commitments as well.	0
ClaimBuster	20656				No, we'll get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	20657				Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education.	0
ClaimBuster	20658				It's going to be a big, big opportunity for a lot of people.	0
ClaimBuster	20659				I think the support prices are tied to the average market price of the last three years, which was Mr. Benson's theory.	1
ClaimBuster	20660				That's the best overall energy policy in the brief time we have to discuss it.	0
ClaimBuster	20661				Now, throwing money at the problem is not the answer.	0
ClaimBuster	20662				When you total up all the federal spending he wants to do, it's the largest increase in federal spending in years.	1
ClaimBuster	20663				Now last year, of course, was 1958.	1
ClaimBuster	20664				I agree with Governor Bush that we should have new accountability, testing of students.	0
ClaimBuster	20665				In the case of the product liability bill, which they passed and I vetoed, I think that's what he's talking about, I actually wanted to sign that bill.	1
ClaimBuster	20666				And that composite now is going to be built around the bridges on the Santa Monica Freeway to help minimize the impact of earthquakes and create more jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	20667				We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now.	0
ClaimBuster	20668				Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe.	0
ClaimBuster	20669				You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him.	0
ClaimBuster	20670				It isn't an issue with Mr. Nixon, who now says that he also supports the Eisenhower policy.	1
ClaimBuster	20671				And secondly, the people that murdered Mr. Byrd got the ultimate punishment.	1
ClaimBuster	20672				We have to get our economy going.	0
ClaimBuster	20673				If you ask me if I could fly a fighter plane or be an astronaut, I can't.	0
ClaimBuster	20674				The state then could determine whether the money would be spent for school construction or teacher salaries.	0
ClaimBuster	20675				And the number of small businesses I've gone to that are saying they're dropping insurance because they can't afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive.	1
ClaimBuster	20676				This is a nation, which, if it falls apart, if it -- if it becomes a failed state, there are nuclear weapons there and you've got -- you've got terrorists there who could grab their -- their hands onto those nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	20677				We can't deal with them.	0
ClaimBuster	20678				When Ronald Reagan won the Texas primary election, Mr. Ford added back another one and a half billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	20679				Are we doing enough in that area?	0
ClaimBuster	20680				Indeed, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 10 to 0, with seven abstentions, against the SALT II treaty, and declared that it was not in the national security interests of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	20681				The president reneged on his promise to fund No Child Left Behind.	1
ClaimBuster	20682				The mission must be clear.	0
ClaimBuster	20683				"I asked: ""Are you better off than you were 4 years before?''"	0
ClaimBuster	20684				I visited a Jeep plant, oldest plant in America, a plant in Toledo, Ohio, where they're going to export 41,000 right hand drive Jeeps this year, and they've got 700 new jobs because of it.	1
ClaimBuster	20685				But just briefly, the Clinton Foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with HIV-AIDS to afford treatment, and that's about half all the people in the world who are getting treatment.	1
ClaimBuster	20686				And that's going to require more than is on the table today.	0
ClaimBuster	20687				Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers.	1
ClaimBuster	20688				Making sure that CEOs are not enriching themselves through this process.	0
ClaimBuster	20689				But I do not think that it was an example of a conflict where we should have put our troops in to try to separate the parties for this reason, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	20690				And the concentration of employment opportunities in those areas would help greatly not only to reestablish the tax base, but also to help reduce the extraordinary welfare cost.	0
ClaimBuster	20691				Congress passed a paperwork reduction act.	1
ClaimBuster	20692				And that's in all sections of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	20693				Lower crime rates for eight years in a row.	1
ClaimBuster	20694				Everybody says you can't do that with Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	20695				And when you are reducing productivity at the same time that you are turning out printing-press money in excessive amounts, you're causing inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	20696				We should try to reduce these circumstances.	0
ClaimBuster	20697				It's ironic that there are now -- there is now a smaller percentage of the voters made up of parents with children than ever in American history because of the aging of our population, but at the same time we've got the largest generation of students in public schools ever.	1
ClaimBuster	20698				We've been around for 240 years.	1
ClaimBuster	20699				We have the best health care delivery system in the world and we want to keep it that way.	0
ClaimBuster	20700				I disagree completely with Senator Kennedy on this point.	0
ClaimBuster	20701				That's the plan that I've put forward.	0
ClaimBuster	20702				And we can do it, but we're going to have to make an investment.	0
ClaimBuster	20703				(Laughter) I'm against that; I oppose that.	0
ClaimBuster	20704				33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she's saying there wasn't anything wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	20705				There was a study just a few weeks ago suggesting that in summertime the north polar ice cap will be completely gone in 50 years.	1
ClaimBuster	20706				They also have the Haqqani Network and the Taliban existent within their country.	1
ClaimBuster	20707				Or, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income.	1
ClaimBuster	20708				And we will never take military options off the table.	0
ClaimBuster	20709				Because the fundamentals of the economy were weak even before this latest crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	20710				And what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more.	1
ClaimBuster	20711				This was a bipartisan idea.	1
ClaimBuster	20712				Yes, we're having tough times, but we do not need to go back to the failed policies of the past, when you had a Democratic president and a spendthrift Democratic Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	20713				He said he thought Saddam Hussein was a grave threat, and now he said it was a mistake to remove Saddam Hussein from power.	1
ClaimBuster	20714				When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately.	1
ClaimBuster	20715				I think in those days after 9/11, I thought the president did a terrific job.	0
ClaimBuster	20716				Two is to say if you want to access reading money, you can do so.	0
ClaimBuster	20717				That's the same percentage that it was twenty years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	20718				In addition to military strength, we need to see that the economy of this country continues to grow.	0
ClaimBuster	20719				Now Governor Carter complains about the deficits that uh - uh - this administration has had.	0
ClaimBuster	20720				We have to bring back law and order.	0
ClaimBuster	20721				We all know about the vote held this week - of the five neutralists - and it was generally regarded as a defeat for the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	20722				I believe that the American people, if given the leadership that I would expect to give, would be willing to give this thrust to preserve the peace and the necessary restraint at home to hold the lid on spending so that we could, I think, have a long overdue and totally justified tax decrease for the middle-income people.	0
ClaimBuster	20723				(Applause) And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	20724				I -- I think interesting the president just said something which -- which is that on the day after the attack he went into the Rose Garden and said that this was an act of terror.	1
ClaimBuster	20725				I'm not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say this is the way it's got to be.	0
ClaimBuster	20726				You know, every life is precious.	0
ClaimBuster	20727				I hope a lot of --	0
ClaimBuster	20728				The rest, as to whether the lands are going to be opened in the next five years or so - we're already five years behind in what we should be doing.	0
ClaimBuster	20729				So these are the ways that we can restore the strength of our country, and they don't require long experience in foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	20730				He thinks, I think he said, that the country is coming apart at the seams.	0
ClaimBuster	20731				Their idea was a budget that the that the American Hospital Association said could close 700 hospitals.	1
ClaimBuster	20732				Uh - Mr. McGee, there are about a hundred and four commodities that have some kind of depletion allowance - different kind of minerals, including oil.	1
ClaimBuster	20733				We'll never have that world leadership until we are strong at home, and we can have that strength if we return to the basic principles.	0
ClaimBuster	20734				We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason: we want higher teachers' salaries.	1
ClaimBuster	20735				I suggest, however, that in the interest of fairness that he could give me the benefit of also believing as he believes.	0
ClaimBuster	20736				I have advocated expansions of public school choice alternatives and I said the creation of 3,000 new schools that we are going to help the states to finance.	1
ClaimBuster	20737				It means keeping America even stronger militarily than she is.	0
ClaimBuster	20738				And it's going to take all the nations together, just as when we banded together we pretty much resolved the whole problem of skyjackings sometime ago.	1
ClaimBuster	20739				He proposed more than Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis combined.	1
ClaimBuster	20740				One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash.	1
ClaimBuster	20741				It opposed all of the programs of President Roosevelt and others - the minimum wage and for housing and economic growth and development of our natural resources, the Tennessee Valley and all the rest.	1
ClaimBuster	20742				I've thought a lot about that particular question, and I see our greatest national strength coming from what we stand for in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	20743				In all those elements, Governor Reagan has repeatedly spoken out against them, which, to me, shows a very great insensitivity to giving deprived families a better chance in life.	1
ClaimBuster	20744				I would use pressure and diplomacy.	0
ClaimBuster	20745				But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.	1
ClaimBuster	20746				I am eternally optimistic, and I happen to believe that we've made great progress from the days when I was young and when this country didn't even know it had a racial problem.	0
ClaimBuster	20747				But when we make this into a divisive political issue, and when we don't have bipartisan support -- I can deliver, Governor, a whole bunch of Democrats to get comprehensive immigration reform done, and we can't...	0
ClaimBuster	20748				She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't -- maybe it was.	0
ClaimBuster	20749				The president's not getting the job done.	0
ClaimBuster	20750				Thank you, well, first let me say that I signed the Family Leave Act.	1
ClaimBuster	20751				Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	20752				I can do a better job of waging a smarter, more effective war on terror and guarantee that we will go after the terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	20753				So that I'm hopeful we can try once more.	0
ClaimBuster	20754				Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we're actually going to look at the facts.	1
ClaimBuster	20755				And I take it back, because I think -- he said he made a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	20756				Now then, that money needs to be -- they don't even pay interest on it.	1
ClaimBuster	20757				but after a decade of war, I think we all recognize we've got to do some nation building here at home, rebuilding our roads, our bridges and especially caring for our Veterans who sacrificed so much for our freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	20758				Where did you find this?	0
ClaimBuster	20759				We have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years.	1
ClaimBuster	20760				Well, I don't know in the case of the trial lawyers.	0
ClaimBuster	20761				He talks about peace and I'm thankful for peace.	0
ClaimBuster	20762				In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born.	1
ClaimBuster	20763				I don't think a president can do that.	0
ClaimBuster	20764				Each of those countries is independent, autonomous: it has its own territorial integrity and the United States does not concede that those countries are under the domination of the Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	20765				And I know talks have started again today.	1
ClaimBuster	20766				I believe that it's in our interest and in the interest of Israel and Iran, and Saudi Arabia, for the United States to sell arms to those countries.	0
ClaimBuster	20767				Well, it isn't going to go back up.	0
ClaimBuster	20768				I have proposed a budget which would put ten years on the life of the Medicare trust fund.	1
ClaimBuster	20769				It shouldn't happen in America.	0
ClaimBuster	20770				It might help the contributions from coming in from Indonesia or other foreign countries, rich people in those countries, and then being sent back after the L.A. Times discovers it, $250,000.	0
ClaimBuster	20771				He cut 112 billion dollars, so we're right on the edge right now.	1
ClaimBuster	20772				Again, it may not work, but if it doesn't work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned.	0
ClaimBuster	20773				As he pointed out, we came to the Congress in the same year.	1
ClaimBuster	20774				I like PBS, I love Big Bird.	0
ClaimBuster	20775				Let me start with the Pell Grants.	0
ClaimBuster	20776				We're having trouble meeting recruiting goals.	0
ClaimBuster	20777				Now, John's been in the Congress for 20 years.	1
ClaimBuster	20778				No, I might as well just go with -- --	0
ClaimBuster	20779				And I don't appreciate it when a candidate for president denigrates the contributions of these brave soldiers.	0
ClaimBuster	20780				We've got 1,000 more Border Patrol agents on the southern border.	1
ClaimBuster	20781				The problem I have with the Perot prescription is that almost all economists who've looked at it say that if you cut the deficit this much this quick it will increase unemployment, it will slow down the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	20782				So we can't simply drill our way out of the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	20783				Because of our programs we have been able to significantly cut defense spending.	1
ClaimBuster	20784				I think Mr. Perot put his finger on something there.	0
ClaimBuster	20785				I think we ought to seriously consider with the exceptions of caring for our veterans national defense and several other vital issues.	0
ClaimBuster	20786				And she won't even mention the word and nor will President Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	20787				So far, it is only a beginning.	0
ClaimBuster	20788				(LAUGHTER) But for those who have not made up their mind, I would like to conclude by this promise.	0
ClaimBuster	20789				And natural gas isn't just appearing magically.	0
ClaimBuster	20790				We can't settle for anything but the best.	0
ClaimBuster	20791				And I like, I like Senator Dole, you can probably tell we like each other.	0
ClaimBuster	20792				On the other hand, I don't think that we have any reason to believe that the dimensions of this crisis are anywhere near as great as the savings and loan crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	20793				I think I was on the advisory committee, Margaret.	1
ClaimBuster	20794				It's crooked -- she's -- she's guilty of a very, very serious crime.	1
ClaimBuster	20795				I've been critical of the Administration's failure to suggest policies which would make it possible for us to establish, for example, closer relations with Poland, particularly after the fifty-five-fifty-six period and the Hungarian revolution.	1
ClaimBuster	20796				That is a multi-year project.	1
ClaimBuster	20797				It is part of my consciousness and of my commitment to continue this progress.	0
ClaimBuster	20798				So as soon as we found out that the Benghazi consulate was being overrun, I was on the phone with my national security team and I gave them three instructions.	1
ClaimBuster	20799				That's what we call a sequester.	0
ClaimBuster	20800				Because there is a major problem there.	0
ClaimBuster	20801				That is why President Eisenhower was correct in not apologizing or expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev at the Paris Conference, as Senator Kennedy suggested he could have done.	0
ClaimBuster	20802				But the point is that I know how to handle these crises.	0
ClaimBuster	20803				The dollar's gone through the floor.	0
ClaimBuster	20804				And that's one of the reasons why it's in our interest.	0
ClaimBuster	20805				Firmness but no belligerence, and by no belligerence I mean that we do not answer insult by insult.	0
ClaimBuster	20806				Talk is cheap; words are plentiful, deeds are precious.	0
ClaimBuster	20807				The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession.	0
ClaimBuster	20808				On the neutralists' resolution, which we were so much opposed to, the same thing happened.	1
ClaimBuster	20809				He puts no real assets into the Social Security system.	0
ClaimBuster	20810				But if I am entrusted with the presidency, it will be the first Civil Rights Act of the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	20811				We've been blessed by having a nation that's free and prosperous thanks to the contributions of the greatest generation.	0
ClaimBuster	20812				Out in the west, yeah.	0
ClaimBuster	20813				I don't know what was right, or what was wrong, or what was done.	0
ClaimBuster	20814				This administration, by going into the Star Wars system, is going to add a dangerous new escalation.	0
ClaimBuster	20815				I know how these people think.	0
ClaimBuster	20816				Because that's one of the most critical issues here: North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	20817				Bill Ayers is a professor of education in Chicago.	1
ClaimBuster	20818				[Laughter] I'm going to use my time a little differently.	0
ClaimBuster	20819				In America, on basic moral questions we have always let the people decide in their own personal lives.	0
ClaimBuster	20820				I'm going to rebuild our military power.	0
ClaimBuster	20821				Now, when we have a presidential candidate, for example - Senator Kennedy - stating over and over again that the United States is second in space and the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight - we've had twenty-eight successful shots, they've had eight; when he states that we're second in education, and I have seen Soviet education and I've seen ours, and we're not; that we're second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall we're way ahead of the Soviet Union and all other countries in science; when he says as he did in January of this year that we have the worst slums, that we have the most crowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night; when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige?	1
ClaimBuster	20822				We can do better, and we must.	0
ClaimBuster	20823				But he also made sure that there was a bipartisan support.	0
ClaimBuster	20824				So to answer your question, I would hope we never have to.	0
ClaimBuster	20825				They're stronger now than at any time since 2001.	1
ClaimBuster	20826				We have made sure that they are isolated.	1
ClaimBuster	20827				I noticed recently that Governor Reagan frequently quotes Democratic presidents in his acceptance address.	1
ClaimBuster	20828				I want to cut that business tax.	0
ClaimBuster	20829				You look at North Korea where they have enough plutonium to build six nuclear bombs.	1
ClaimBuster	20830				And let's -- you know, let's be clear about what he is saying and what that means.	0
ClaimBuster	20831				I'd like to see a balanced budget amendment for America, to protect the American taxpayers, and then that would discipline not only the executive branch but the spending Congress, the Congress that's been in control of one party, his party, for 38 years.	1
ClaimBuster	20832				That's why I support a teacher liability act at the federal level, that says if a teacher or principal upholds reasonable standards of classroom discipline they can't be sued.	1
ClaimBuster	20833				That's why I want to get these debts down and these interest rates down, restore America's exports, help rural America, which is suffering so much, and bring the jobs back here for our children.	0
ClaimBuster	20834				Now, these are all positions of the ACLU.	0
ClaimBuster	20835				The president bears the constitutional responsibility, not the secretary of state, for the conduct of foreign affairs.	1
ClaimBuster	20836				But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception.	0
ClaimBuster	20837				And the first voter was a 19-year-old woman.	1
ClaimBuster	20838				Now she's blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln.	1
ClaimBuster	20839				I have made the cause of children and families really my life's work.	0
ClaimBuster	20840				I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	20841				Now America has been carrying a tremendous load in this respect.	0
ClaimBuster	20842				I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.	0
ClaimBuster	20843				After my plan is in place, the wealthiest Americans will pay a higher percentage of taxes then they do today, the poorest of Americans, six million families, won't pay any tax at all.	1
ClaimBuster	20844				Well, actually, he forgot Poland.	1
ClaimBuster	20845				I know Senator Kennedy suggested in his speech at Cleveland yesterday that that committee had not been particularly effective.	1
ClaimBuster	20846				The man who may be developing weapons of mass destruction, we don't know because inspectors aren't in.	1
ClaimBuster	20847				I can't emphasize to you how much.	0
ClaimBuster	20848				I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	20849				But fully, my short range answer is fully fund that McKinney Act.	0
ClaimBuster	20850				"But the Washington Post ran a long editorial today saying they couldn't believe Mr. Bush was making character an issue and they said he was the greatest quote ""political chameleon"" for changing his positions of all times."	1
ClaimBuster	20851				So we have a long history of having a lot of talented women.	1
ClaimBuster	20852				The whole premise behind Senator Obama's plans are class warfare, let's spread the wealth around.	1
ClaimBuster	20853				But let me comment on the report.	0
ClaimBuster	20854				No one from Arizona is against solar.	1
ClaimBuster	20855				I've had a strong record of working with Democrats and Republicans in Texas to make sure no child is left behind.	1
ClaimBuster	20856				Our opponents say, things are okay.	0
ClaimBuster	20857				And I think that's where maybe the vice president and I begin to have some differences.	0
ClaimBuster	20858				Meanwhile, while Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons, some 37 tons of what they called yellow cake, the stuff they use to make enriched uranium, while they're doing that, North Korea has moved from one bomb maybe, maybe, to four to seven bombs.	1
ClaimBuster	20859				There's nothing wrong with that.	0
ClaimBuster	20860				It has not been standing still.	0
ClaimBuster	20861				And the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class.	1
ClaimBuster	20862				The Mideast is very difficult.	0
ClaimBuster	20863				The book you mentioned that Vice President Gore wrote, he also called for taxing -- big energy taxes in order to clean up the environment.	1
ClaimBuster	20864				So what is the answer?	0
ClaimBuster	20865				A 1% increase in interest rates in that $2.8 trillion is $28 billion a year.	1
ClaimBuster	20866				They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people.	1
ClaimBuster	20867				This is a major problem facing America.	0
ClaimBuster	20868				We have to keep the drugs out of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	20869				I spend a good deal of time talking to young people, and in my standard speech out there on the stump I usually end my speech by saying, I want to ask you for something and I want to direct it especially to the young people in the audience.	1
ClaimBuster	20870				First of all, what kind of mixed message does it send when you have $500 million going over to Iraq to put police officers in the streets of Iraq, and the president is cutting the COPS program in America?	1
ClaimBuster	20871				So he's got the oil and gas part, but he doesn't have the clean energy part.	1
ClaimBuster	20872				And all of those things happened because the Philippines do crave democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	20873				I worked with Senator Mitchell, who played me, I guess, in the debate warmup.	1
ClaimBuster	20874				We're in an information age when learning is more important than ever.	0
ClaimBuster	20875				That's what we did in Haiti.	1
ClaimBuster	20876				We can do better than that, particularly in Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	20877				I don't think he'll be reelected because trickle down economics is a failure and he's offering more of it, and what he's saying about my program is just not true.	1
ClaimBuster	20878				And may I make an observation - part of the question you asked, Mr. Trewhitt?	0
ClaimBuster	20879				But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices.	1
ClaimBuster	20880				And the way I view it is there's a lot of entrenched special interests there, people who are, you know, on one side of the issue or another and they spend enormous sums of money and they convince different senators to taut their way or different congressmen to talk about their issue, and they dig in.	0
ClaimBuster	20881				It is terrible to bus tiny little children across town.	0
ClaimBuster	20882				Well, I would say first of all that Senator's - Kennedy's statement that he's just made is not going to help our Gallup Polls abroad and it isn't going to help our prestige either.	0
ClaimBuster	20883				We've gained manufacturing jobs since I've been President.	1
ClaimBuster	20884				And that means that the ordinary American out there who's collecting a paycheck every day, they've got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them.	0
ClaimBuster	20885				I've got 5.5 million hard-working people who put me on the ballot, and I belong to them.	1
ClaimBuster	20886				Everyone in this room, practically, here tonight, is an immigrant.	1
ClaimBuster	20887				But I'm going to create a -- the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry.	0
ClaimBuster	20888				Bob, thank you very much.	0
ClaimBuster	20889				So, she's allowed to do that, but I'm not allowed to respond?	0
ClaimBuster	20890				Well, Mr. Kraft, uh - I violently disagree with your assessment.	0
ClaimBuster	20891				And this decision you're about to make better be about what kind of economic theory you want, not just people saying I'm going to go fix it but what are we going to do?	0
ClaimBuster	20892				He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions.	0
ClaimBuster	20893				We have men and women wearing our uniform in substandard housing.	1
ClaimBuster	20894				Let me just say that obviously tonight we're going to hear some phony numbers about what I think and what we ought to do.	0
ClaimBuster	20895				And I've already made a proposal - and yes, it will cost some money.	0
ClaimBuster	20896				Should we have listened to my opponent who wanted to send the UN into the Persian Gulf or in spite of the mistakes of the past, are we doing better there?	1
ClaimBuster	20897				We don't take care of our veterans.	0
ClaimBuster	20898				Now there is a the democratically elected president in Haiti.	1
ClaimBuster	20899				And since that day, our nation has been on a multi-pronged strategy to keep our country safer.	1
ClaimBuster	20900				Thank goodness the networks have a fact check so I don't have to just go blue in the face anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	20901				But what I won't do is change my core values because of politics or because of pressure.	0
ClaimBuster	20902				It's not much fun sometimes.	0
ClaimBuster	20903				Three weeks from now -- 2 weeks from tomorrow, America goes to the polls and you're going to have to decide who you want to lead this country to economic recovery.	0
ClaimBuster	20904				We didn't fund a lot of other things this year, like the savings and loan mess.	1
ClaimBuster	20905				But ultimately, Syrians are going to have to determine their own future.	0
ClaimBuster	20906				I also have a plan to win the war on terror, funding homeland security, strengthening our military, cutting our finances, reaching out to the world, again building strong alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	20907				Republican governors as well as Democratic governors.	0
ClaimBuster	20908				We later said no, that's not true.	1
ClaimBuster	20909				I'm for getting rid of the death tax, completely getting rid of the death tax.	0
ClaimBuster	20910				This is the problem I have with the big spending liberals.	0
ClaimBuster	20911				New world order to me means freedom and democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	20912				You can't -- but you can't have the president just lay out a whole series of items without giving me a chance to respond.	0
ClaimBuster	20913				Well, first of all, I think it's important to tell you that we did come in during some tough times.	0
ClaimBuster	20914				And I don't believe she does have the stamina.	0
ClaimBuster	20915				I think that would be a very serious mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	20916				... which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't.	0
ClaimBuster	20917				We're the richest country on the face of the planet, the only industrialized nation in the world not to do it.	1
ClaimBuster	20918				Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio.	1
ClaimBuster	20919				We've got more money going out for local police than any previous administration.	1
ClaimBuster	20920				We are mortgaging our children's future.	0
ClaimBuster	20921				Uh - I will say simply, in advance of it, that I believe that in this area, the laws which should be passed uh - as far as the big national emergency strikes are concerned, are ones that will give the president more weapons with which to deal with those strikes.	0
ClaimBuster	20922				Medicare is for seniors, who many of them are on fixed income, to lift them out of poverty.	1
ClaimBuster	20923				I'm meeting folks all over the country.	1
ClaimBuster	20924				And we talk about evidence.	0
ClaimBuster	20925				Health-care costs are on the rise because the consumers are not involved in the decision-making process.	1
ClaimBuster	20926				For the first time in the 20th century the President has done that in all four years and that's why I don't want to see us blow a big hole in the deficit with a tax program we can't pay for, so your interest rates will go up, and you'll have to pay back in higher interest rates what you allegedly will get in a tax cut, so I say keep working on expanding the markets.	1
ClaimBuster	20927				The removal of Russian troops from the Baltics.	0
ClaimBuster	20928				And while I have a last word here, I would like to correct a misstatement of fact by the President.	0
ClaimBuster	20929				And then let's take the last one, championing small business.	0
ClaimBuster	20930				And therefore, wealthy people are going to get it.	0
ClaimBuster	20931				Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places.	0
ClaimBuster	20932				Senator Obama had the opening.	0
ClaimBuster	20933				How many leaders in the world today would respond to us, as a result of what we've done, in that way?	0
ClaimBuster	20934				And that's where our society must head if we're going to be a peaceful and prosperous society.	0
ClaimBuster	20935				I see people in my state, middle class people -- their taxes have gone up in Washington and their services have gone down while the wealthy have gotten tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	20936				We've got fundamental problems in the system.	1
ClaimBuster	20937				That would mean, of course, that for a family of four that that family would have a thousand dollars more personal exemption - money that they could spend for their own purposes, money that the government wouldn't have to spend.	1
ClaimBuster	20938				And the problem is, with Governments - Federal, State and Local - taking $.44 out of every dollar earned, that the Federal Government has pre-empted too many of the tax sources, and that the cities.	1
ClaimBuster	20939				And so what we're seeing is a pretty dramatic reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region.	0
ClaimBuster	20940				This is a movement that came from the people.	1
ClaimBuster	20941				I'd like to start by telling you what my vision is.	0
ClaimBuster	20942				And believe me, if you knew my family and if you knew the private life I have, you would agree in a minute that that's a whole lot more fun than getting involved in politics.	0
ClaimBuster	20943				I will tell you this: I will not give anyone special treatment and I will strictly adhere to the law.	0
ClaimBuster	20944				I agree with that, John.	0
ClaimBuster	20945				I want to remind you that it wasn't just my administration that made the decision on safety.	1
ClaimBuster	20946				We have weakened our capacity to project power around the world because we have viewed everything through this single lens, not to mention, look at our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	20947				So the fact is that Senator Obama is spending unprecedented -- unprecedented in the history of American politics, going back to the beginning, amounts of money in negative attack ads on me.	1
ClaimBuster	20948				I don't want to cut our commitment to education.	0
ClaimBuster	20949				I served for eight years in the United States Senate and served on the Armed Services Committee.	1
ClaimBuster	20950				We've got an energy bill on the Senate floor right now that contains some good stuff, some stuff you want, including drilling off-shore, but you're opposed to it because it would strip away those tax breaks that have gone to oil companies.	1
ClaimBuster	20951				Now, whether it's character or judgment -- whatever it is -- I have a big difference here on this issue and so we'll just have to see how it plays out.	0
ClaimBuster	20952				It had been cut in two by President Gerald Ford.	1
ClaimBuster	20953				And finally, sir, to answer your question, you need somebody in office who will tell the truth.	0
ClaimBuster	20954				But going back to Libya -- because this is an example of how we make choices.	0
ClaimBuster	20955				We end up being problem solvers.	0
ClaimBuster	20956				Every year Congress and the president sign laws that make us do more things and gives us less money to do it with.	1
ClaimBuster	20957				And you got to be careful here, because there's a safety factor, but I think these things - and then also I am one who believes we've got to go the extra mile in clean - being sure that that blood supply is pure.	0
ClaimBuster	20958				That's why we opposed the government take over health care plan that President Clinton tried and tried and tried to get through Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	20959				You could knock out the tax increases and you could do what the people want, and that's create enterprise zones.	0
ClaimBuster	20960				And I am going to be a president who is serious, I hope and expect will be liked by the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	20961				Tell Silvio Berlusconi we're going alone.	0
ClaimBuster	20962				So here's what my plan does.	0
ClaimBuster	20963				He voted twice for a budget resolution that increases the taxes on individuals making $42,000 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	20964				At the same time every year, it increased the amount of money -- virtually every year, there may have been one or two that were skipped in there -- that was subject to that tax.	1
ClaimBuster	20965				I have Blue Cross/Blue Shield.	1
ClaimBuster	20966				That's one of the major differences we have about defending our country.	0
ClaimBuster	20967				And I believe that, while all of the promises have been broken, they've never been carried out.	0
ClaimBuster	20968				But, at the end of the day, my friend, I have to tell you again, and you know what it's like to serve, and you know what it's like to sacrifice, but we can never allow a second Holocaust to take place.	0
ClaimBuster	20969				It was about emergencies, wasn't it?	0
ClaimBuster	20970				Finally, if we don't fix this, you're right.	0
ClaimBuster	20971				That's just what the president did when he vetoed the Family Leave Act.	1
ClaimBuster	20972				Folks, we can build that bridge to the 21st Century, big enough and strong enough for all of us to walk across, and I hope you will help me build it.	0
ClaimBuster	20973				You know, I've had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country.	1
ClaimBuster	20974				Russia is in part resurgent and Putin is feeling powerful because of petro-dollars, as Senator McCain mentioned.	1
ClaimBuster	20975				Now, Governor Romney talked about China, as I already indicated.	1
ClaimBuster	20976				And I'm hoping we can start some payments on it before we get through here.	0
ClaimBuster	20977				And recently when he was asked specifically about Iraq, he said there is nothing we can do about it.	1
ClaimBuster	20978				We need to indict Ahmadinejad.	0
ClaimBuster	20979				Israel is our friend and we'll stand by Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	20980				We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them.	0
ClaimBuster	20981				I would rather that a million come from our own hemisphere, our own country as opposed to Saddam Hussein.	0
ClaimBuster	20982				Those are the fuzzy math figures put together by some group that works for the campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	20983				You're 150 -- excuse me, I think it's a little more, about $100 million shy of what you ought to be under the No Child Left Behind Act to help your education system here.	1
ClaimBuster	20984				There's only been uh - a net savings of $4 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	20985				And today it's less than 1 percent, because we're working together to try to bring this deficit under control.	1
ClaimBuster	20986				And that's the tragedy of the Iran/Contra scandal.	0
ClaimBuster	20987				So you may end up getting a $5,000 tax credit.	0
ClaimBuster	20988				I believe in the balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	20989				I think we're both supportive of them and I would strongly lead in that area as I have in my state as Governor.	0
ClaimBuster	20990				In this particular area, I think the Vice President and I are in general agreement on what we have to do.	0
ClaimBuster	20991				They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years.	1
ClaimBuster	20992				We have -- our military, the morale is high.	0
ClaimBuster	20993				We've gone through a Great Depression in our lifetime that literally was worldwide and almost brought us to our knees.	1
ClaimBuster	20994				If the job were finished, I might have thought twice about seeking reelection for this job.	0
ClaimBuster	20995				And Iraq is going to be free, and America will be better off for it.	0
ClaimBuster	20996				And I think what I don't know is what all of us don't know, and that's what's going to happen both here at home and abroad.	0
ClaimBuster	20997				I see it as a question of values.	0
ClaimBuster	20998				The people need to take their government back.	0
ClaimBuster	20999				I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isn't dangerous and won't kill them and won't destroy their lives, get the message and change.	0
ClaimBuster	21000				And there are ways of doing it.	0
ClaimBuster	21001				She's a United States -- she was a United States senator.	1
ClaimBuster	21002				People don't dare -- medical practitioners, to help somebody along the highway that are hurt because they're afraid that some lawyer's going to come along and get a big lawsuit.	0
ClaimBuster	21003				Right now, because of previous agreements, some made by President Clinton, the goods and products that we send to Colombia, which is our largest agricultural importer of our products, is -- there's a billion dollars that we -- our businesses have paid so far in order to get our goods in there.	1
ClaimBuster	21004				In California, we made 37 billion dollars' worth of telecommunications equipment eligible for export for the first time.	1
ClaimBuster	21005				Not only would it threaten Israel, our strongest ally in the region and one of our strongest allies in the world, but it would also create a possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	21006				I think it's a very clear contrast.	0
ClaimBuster	21007				And I say a majority of the Republicans are opposed to it.	1
ClaimBuster	21008				This is a family tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	21009				The answer is that the United States can't afford to have a es- an es - a espionage lack or should we s- uh - lag - or should I say uh - an intelligence lag - any more than we can afford to have a missile lag.	0
ClaimBuster	21010				Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top.	0
ClaimBuster	21011				She's the one and Obama that caused the violence.	0
ClaimBuster	21012				There's no question in my mind that if the president were to be reelected you'll continue to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up.	0
ClaimBuster	21013				I wake up every day thinking about how best to protect America.	1
ClaimBuster	21014				When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster.	0
ClaimBuster	21015				I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people -- is it morally right?	0
ClaimBuster	21016				Uh - earlier, uh - Mr. Levi, his uh - attorney general, put forward a gun control proposal, which Mr. Ford later, I believe, espoused, that called for the prohibition against the uh sale aw- of the uh - so-called Saturday Night Specials.	1
ClaimBuster	21017				As a businessperson, I had to have -- I need to know the regulations.	0
ClaimBuster	21018				I want to make sure that we have the ships that are required by our Navy.	0
ClaimBuster	21019				I want to keep their taxes down on small business.	0
ClaimBuster	21020				It was personal e-mails, not official.	1
ClaimBuster	21021				I don't even have a seal yet.	1
ClaimBuster	21022				So I have a record.	1
ClaimBuster	21023				One is a path represented by the president, which at the end of four years would mean we'd have $20 trillion in debt heading towards Greece.	1
ClaimBuster	21024				That's all behind us now, and it should be behind us, and the forgotten war, the Korean War, but I guess I can just answer you very plainly, Jason.	0
ClaimBuster	21025				We have a very consistent policy in the Middle East: It is to support the peace process; to support the security of Israel; and to support those who are prepared to take risks for peace.	1
ClaimBuster	21026				He won't tell you because he can't.	0
ClaimBuster	21027				I believe there are 1.4 million children in Texas who do not have health insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	21028				Let's not raise taxes on anybody today.	0
ClaimBuster	21029				And, of course, we know that the Russians control other sources of energy into Europe, which they have used from time to time.	1
ClaimBuster	21030				Your own Council of Economic Advisers -- Mr. Feldstein in his report told you that.	1
ClaimBuster	21031				I think that's the big assignment, the big task, the big function of the federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	21032				It's impossible for mayors or governors to cooperate with the resident, because they can't anticipate what's gonna happen next.	0
ClaimBuster	21033				Freedom is on the march.	0
ClaimBuster	21034				I know these folks and I know their families.	1
ClaimBuster	21035				Well, he mentioned the debt.	1
ClaimBuster	21036				Well, there's a lot of stuff that was put out there, so let me try to address it.	0
ClaimBuster	21037				And we need to reverse that.	0
ClaimBuster	21038				You've got to do that; we got to get those costs down.	0
ClaimBuster	21039				I'm pledging I will not raise taxes; I'm giving a tax cut to the people earning less than $200,000 a year.	0
ClaimBuster	21040				I -- listen, I -- we've got a great country.	0
ClaimBuster	21041				Miss Quinn, I don't have to.	0
ClaimBuster	21042				But nobody was caring much about it.	0
ClaimBuster	21043				We -- as president, I will sit on day one -- actually, the day after I get elected -- I'll sit down with leaders -- the Democratic leaders, as well as Republican leaders, and continue -- as we did in my state -- we met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the -- in the -- in our state in that case.	1
ClaimBuster	21044				She gave us ISIS, because her and Obama created this huge vacuum, and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when -- we should never have been in Iraq, but once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out.	0
ClaimBuster	21045				Now, if these aren't special interests, I've got a lot to learn.	0
ClaimBuster	21046				The captains are leaving the service.	1
ClaimBuster	21047				I remember when Ronald Reagan was the president; he stood on principle.	0
ClaimBuster	21048				First of all, let me say he's not for a government-run health care system?	0
ClaimBuster	21049				I went to increase early childhood education and the notion that we should freeze that when there may be, for example, this Medicare subsidy, I think, doesn't make sense.	0
ClaimBuster	21050				I'd like to have what 43 governors have -- the line item veto, so if the Congress can't cut, and we've got a reckless spending Congress, let the president have a shot at it by wiping out things that are pork barrel or something of that nature.	1
ClaimBuster	21051				Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I'm reaching out to all Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone.	0
ClaimBuster	21052				Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton.	1
ClaimBuster	21053				I'm beginning to think not only did he invent the Internet, but he invented the calculator.	0
ClaimBuster	21054				We have to also stand by our allies.	0
ClaimBuster	21055				There's no certain road to the presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	21056				He suggested we pass an aid to education bill.	1
ClaimBuster	21057				The quality of the air's cleaner since I've been the president.	1
ClaimBuster	21058				We passed this year the most furthest looking transportation bill in the history of this country since Eisenhower started the interstate highways -- $150 billion for improving the infrastructure.	1
ClaimBuster	21059				Well, Prime Minister Allawi was here.	1
ClaimBuster	21060				When something happens that endangers our security, or when something happens that threatens our stature in the world, or when American people are endangered by the actions of a foreign country, uh - just forty uh sailors on the Mayaguez, we obviously have to move aggressively and quickly to rescue them.	0
ClaimBuster	21061				I disagree with the vice president on this issue.	0
ClaimBuster	21062				These are families that get hurt.	0
ClaimBuster	21063				Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account.	1
ClaimBuster	21064				I've been in them all my life.	1
ClaimBuster	21065				And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back.	0
ClaimBuster	21066				Also as far as religion is concerned.	0
ClaimBuster	21067				It was a bad decision for America and would have been bad for our future if I hadn't stopped it.	0
ClaimBuster	21068				What I want to do is change the dynamics on the ground.	0
ClaimBuster	21069				And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.	0
ClaimBuster	21070				And when it comes to public ethics, he has a responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	21071				Now he's having to say that again.	1
ClaimBuster	21072				And the problem, John, with the strategy that's been pursued was that, for 10 years, we coddled Musharraf, we alienated the Pakistani population, because we were anti-democratic.	1
ClaimBuster	21073				I wasn't just getting more power and more power.	0
ClaimBuster	21074				And that allows us also to rebuild alliances and make friends around the world to combat future threats.	0
ClaimBuster	21075				So I am still focussed on gridlock, I guess.	0
ClaimBuster	21076				But we're so, turned so inward we don't understand the global picture.	0
ClaimBuster	21077				That's what we've been doing over the last eight years and that has actually made us more safe.	1
ClaimBuster	21078				There is not a simple answer.	0
ClaimBuster	21079				There is a difference between big federal government and somebody who is coming from outside of Washington who will trust individuals.	0
ClaimBuster	21080				We need to have more second chance programs.	0
ClaimBuster	21081				I've heard them explain - try to explain - how they tell their children how they can go into a store and buy a loaf of bread but then can't go into that store and sit at the counter and get a Coca Cola.	1
ClaimBuster	21082				We shot, what, 44 cruise missiles, worth about a million-two a piece, and hit some radar, that repaired in a couple, three days.	1
ClaimBuster	21083				We do so in my state of Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	21084				Now, you didn't hear any plan from the president, because he doesn't have a plan to lower the cost of health care.	1
ClaimBuster	21085				We need to move in a new direction.	0
ClaimBuster	21086				I will get us on track to a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	21087				And then as a last resort only, continue to use atomic power.	0
ClaimBuster	21088				50 million Americans get no tax relief under his plan.	1
ClaimBuster	21089				Five million people have lost their health insurance under this president.	1
ClaimBuster	21090				But we are going to have to have some leadership from Washington that not only sets out much better regulations for the financial system.	0
ClaimBuster	21091				It's a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	21092				He has to operate in Massachusetts under a balanced budget proviso.	0
ClaimBuster	21093				Is the Middle East in tumult?	0
ClaimBuster	21094				It'd be fine with me.	0
ClaimBuster	21095				So I will have in my race more than $100 million put in -- of my money, meaning I'm not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she's doing.	1
ClaimBuster	21096				I've been working on this for a long, long time.	1
ClaimBuster	21097				"Here's what we'' -- give them a demonstration and then say -- ""Here's what we can do."	0
ClaimBuster	21098				But I can't take what is an article of faith for me and legislate it for someone who doesn't share that article of faith, whether they be agnostic, atheist, Jew, Protestant, whatever.	0
ClaimBuster	21099				The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board.	0
ClaimBuster	21100				In my judgment that statement has been distorted uh - by Mr. Nixon and others in their debates around the country and in their discussions.	0
ClaimBuster	21101				Everybody's running against the incumbent.	1
ClaimBuster	21102				My plan would dedicate $20 billion a year in each of the next 4 years for investments in new transportation, communications, environmental clean-ups and new technologies for the 21st century.	1
ClaimBuster	21103				I'm afraid I misspoke when I said a CIA head in Nicaragua.	0
ClaimBuster	21104				And we did get their attention.	0
ClaimBuster	21105				Now, there are terrorists trying to get their hands on that stuff today.	0
ClaimBuster	21106				Now, I have a plan to fix this problem and it has got to do with energy independence.	0
ClaimBuster	21107				And that's why I was so -- I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	21108				All of these things and all the promises and commitments that Senator Obama and I made (inaudible) made to you tonight will base -- will be based on whether you can trust us or not to be careful stewards of your tax dollar, to make sure America is safe and secure and prosperous, to make sure we reform the institutions of government.	0
ClaimBuster	21109				That's the difference between us.	1
ClaimBuster	21110				For 40 years, the Republican Party platforms called for guaranteeing women equal rights with a constitutional amendment.	1
ClaimBuster	21111				There's a lot of talk about trigger locks being on guns sold in the future.	1
ClaimBuster	21112				You might think that with that kind of concern that Senator Obama would have gone to Afghanistan, particularly given his responsibilities as a subcommittee chairman.	0
ClaimBuster	21113				And everyone of them -- the boys' club leaders, the ministers -- all of them were saying pass enterprise zones.	0
ClaimBuster	21114				I want to make sure the public school system in America keeps its promise so not one child is left behind.	0
ClaimBuster	21115				And what kind of small business do you have?	0
ClaimBuster	21116				The middle-income families in America have been crushed over the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	21117				That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.	0
ClaimBuster	21118				Let's remember the way to win is not to retreat and not to surrender.	0
ClaimBuster	21119				And so, in our seven years, we find that we have been firm in our diplomacy; we have never made concessions without getting concessions in return.	1
ClaimBuster	21120				But I think that we should find a way to allow some kind of civic unions, and I basically agree with Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman.	0
ClaimBuster	21121				I think I should respond to that.	0
ClaimBuster	21122				I think we can agree on that in the course of this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	21123				But in this great society of ours, wouldn't it make a lot more sense, in this gentle and kind society, if we had a program that made it possible for when incidents come along in which someone feels they must do away with that unborn child, that instead we make it available for the adoption?	0
ClaimBuster	21124				I have been accused lately of having a secret plan with regard to the hostages.	1
ClaimBuster	21125				Number one, add another million children to the insured ranks through the Medicaid program.	0
ClaimBuster	21126				We're going into the next century a better America.	0
ClaimBuster	21127				But what we've done is use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the United States to preserve the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	21128				I favor higher salaries for teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	21129				And -- and we're going to have to recognize that we have to do as the president has done.	0
ClaimBuster	21130				And -- and we've got to deal with cost.	0
ClaimBuster	21131				But the only way you can express your love for clean water is to double the appropriations for clean water, and then rant against the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	21132				And what I've also said is for young people who come here, brought here often times by their parents.	0
ClaimBuster	21133				And, Mr. President, just yesterday the Duelfer report told you and the whole world they worked.	1
ClaimBuster	21134				I can talk to people, as my wife Teresa does, about making other choices, and about abstinence, and about all these other things that we ought to do as a responsible society.	0
ClaimBuster	21135				She's been talking about it for years.	1
ClaimBuster	21136				And you're going to stop them?	0
ClaimBuster	21137				It encouraged them to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	21138				And it did and we will win this one and we won't come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail.	0
ClaimBuster	21139				You know what it is?	0
ClaimBuster	21140				And that's why I've proposed what I think is a fair and a responsible proposal that helps protect these people who've already got no relief or actually got a tax increase.	0
ClaimBuster	21141				So, my heritage as a Southerner, my experience in the Oval Office, convinces me that what I have just described is a proper course for the future.	1
ClaimBuster	21142				I never dreamed that some day I would win that nomination and be my party's nominee for president.	0
ClaimBuster	21143				I had the honor of visiting with Prime Minister Allawi.	1
ClaimBuster	21144				Margaret, Kitty and I had very much the same kind of experience that the Bushes had: we lost a baby, lived about twenty minutes after it was born.	1
ClaimBuster	21145				We have to move ahead in order to stay ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	21146				... have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief.	1
ClaimBuster	21147				There's been no change in my attitude at all.	1
ClaimBuster	21148				If the money does not come in there to pay for these programs, we will cut other government spending or we will slow down the phase-in of the programs.	0
ClaimBuster	21149				Why didn't you change it when you were a senator?	0
ClaimBuster	21150				I'll look at it at the time.	0
ClaimBuster	21151				Well what you're seeing in this country is 23 million people struggling to find a job.	1
ClaimBuster	21152				I'm going to keep my word to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	21153				I'm against removing dams in the northwest.	0
ClaimBuster	21154				One of those ideas was to repeal the minimum wage, and several times this year, Governor Reagan has said that the major cause of unemployment is the minimum wage.	1
ClaimBuster	21155				More progress in the past eight years than in the whole eighty years before.	1
ClaimBuster	21156				I think the business community wants to get involved.	0
ClaimBuster	21157				I thought that was the subject we were supposed to be on.	0
ClaimBuster	21158				He said it was in the public interest at the time and most everybody who was involved in it, I guess, thought it was.	1
ClaimBuster	21159				Only 95 percent of them -- 95 percent come in today uninspected.	1
ClaimBuster	21160				Because you'd be in jail.	0
ClaimBuster	21161				And so when I sit down with the Secretary of the Navy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we determine how are we going to be best able to meet all of our defense needs in a way that also keeps faith with our troops, that also makes sure that our veterans have the kind of support that they need when they come home.	1
ClaimBuster	21162				As far as a summit conference is concerned, I want to make my position absolutely clear.	0
ClaimBuster	21163				This is the biggest kiss that's been given to -- to New York banks I've ever seen.	0
ClaimBuster	21164				Certainly the President of the United States, the highest office in the world, the most important office in the world, has a responsibility to young people, as we talked about earlier.	0
ClaimBuster	21165				That answer almost made me want to scowl.	0
ClaimBuster	21166				And that means that the local law enforcement officials need help at the federal level.	0
ClaimBuster	21167				I mean, Senator McCain has been talking tough about earmarks, and that's good, but earmarks account for about $18 billion of our budget.	1
ClaimBuster	21168				But on the other hand, he has a responsibility to be accurate.	0
ClaimBuster	21169				I find that just absolutely...	0
ClaimBuster	21170				Now let's move a million people from welfare to work.	0
ClaimBuster	21171				But, unfortunately, a lot of schools are trapping children in schools that just won't teach and won't change.	0
ClaimBuster	21172				And, like Franklin Roosevelt, I don't care whether an idea is a Republican idea or a Democrat idea.	0
ClaimBuster	21173				Because the Congress failed to act, I am going to announce tomorrow that the Department of Commerce will disclose those companies that have uh - participated in the Arab boycott.	0
ClaimBuster	21174				I think they're better off, all of us are, that we got the interest rates down and the deficit down.	1
ClaimBuster	21175				But what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me.	0
ClaimBuster	21176				I think that this is a kind of a hypocritical policy when, at the same time, we're maintaining a detente with the one nation in the world where there are no human rights at all - the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	21177				We've got agreements, but they are still there.	0
ClaimBuster	21178				Well, you talk about walking a waffle line -- he says he's allowed it, which means he's going to allow the destruction of life up to a certain amount and then he isn't going to allow it.	0
ClaimBuster	21179				The president takes credit for all these people off welfare.	0
ClaimBuster	21180				We are back on the right track.	0
ClaimBuster	21181				The program that the president -- two-thirds of the budget, I as president never get to look at, never get to touch.	0
ClaimBuster	21182				That was done with much thought and deliberation.	0
ClaimBuster	21183				Mr. President, you're batting 0 for 2.	0
ClaimBuster	21184				In adesh- in addition, uh - uh - as a result of my pressure an the Congress, we got a major mass transit program uh - over a four-year period, eleven billion eight-hundred million dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	21185				It means a lot to a lot of people watching us tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	21186				I met with the Black Congressional Caucus at the White House.	1
ClaimBuster	21187				Well, I think -- let's talk about taxes, because I think it's instructive.	0
ClaimBuster	21188				I just want to make this point, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	21189				It's now the largest peacetime government ever in terms of the take from the total economy.	1
ClaimBuster	21190				We just see the world in different ways.	0
ClaimBuster	21191				And how to get them passed?	0
ClaimBuster	21192				I think you'll see more minority candidates and women candidates coming forward.	0
ClaimBuster	21193				Under my plan the man gets immediate help with prescription drugs.	1
ClaimBuster	21194				Children whose parents wouldn't speak English as a first language just move through.	0
ClaimBuster	21195				And at this point, it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six-party -- or the six-point cease-fire.	0
ClaimBuster	21196				My opponent talks about fiscal sanity.	1
ClaimBuster	21197				A president's job is to win the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	21198				And that's why proliferation is one of the centerpieces of a multi-prong strategy to make the country safer.	0
ClaimBuster	21199				Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	21200				That's not the way to end unemployment or to reduce unemployment.	0
ClaimBuster	21201				The fact is I've picked somebody who not only will be a great Vice President, but if, God forbid, something happens to the president, could step into that office and do so with distinction and with strength and with leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	21202				I hope they talked and I hope they've reached some result and that the killing will end.	0
ClaimBuster	21203				We believe in tough love.	0
ClaimBuster	21204				But I can tell you this.	0
ClaimBuster	21205				She's cut the size of government.	1
ClaimBuster	21206				Third, what's really hurting American business more than anything else is the cost of health care.	0
ClaimBuster	21207				We can make a huge difference by saying if you receive federal money we expect you to show results.	0
ClaimBuster	21208				And I hope that he'll be out of office very shortly.	0
ClaimBuster	21209				And so what we did was take away those leases.	0
ClaimBuster	21210				What Mr. Gore's plan will do causing huge payroll taxes or major benefit reductions.	0
ClaimBuster	21211				Yes, I have stated in both uh - debates and state again that I believe in a balanced budget and have supported that concept during my fourteen years in the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	21212				Till they're destroyed, some crazy person can either sell them or use them.	0
ClaimBuster	21213				If you confiscate the Forbes 400 wealth, take it all, you cannot balance the budget this year.	1
ClaimBuster	21214				I cast my lot with the people even when it means that you have to stand up to some powerful interests who are trying to turn the -- the policies and the laws to their advantage.	0
ClaimBuster	21215				A lot of good people have lost jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	21216				If you give me four years more I will work on it some more and I will try to answer these charges, but I prefer to emphasize direct answers to the future and I gave you a direct answer.	0
ClaimBuster	21217				I think this is very harmful at a time Mr. Khrushchev is here - harmful because it's wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	21218				This election is about big things.	0
ClaimBuster	21219				Now, if you study our international competitors, some of our international competitors collect up to $3.50 a gallon in taxes, and they use that money to build infrastructure and to create jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	21220				This is one of the most emotional and difficult issues that could possibly be debated.	0
ClaimBuster	21221				Well, there he goes again, that line has been used before, I mean, exaggerating all the things that he did.	0
ClaimBuster	21222				So we need more protection from America.	0
ClaimBuster	21223				We uh - now encourage people to waste electricity, and uh - by giving uh - the lowest rates to the biggest users.	1
ClaimBuster	21224				We - quite often we have a transient problem.	0
ClaimBuster	21225				I understand what it's like to send young American's in harm's way.	0
ClaimBuster	21226				After 9/11, after the recession had ended, the president asked for another tax cut and promised 5.6 million jobs would be created.	1
ClaimBuster	21227				But we did something else that was interesting.	0
ClaimBuster	21228				Senator Obama was the second highest recipient of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac money in history -- in history.	1
ClaimBuster	21229				... but -- but -- but overall.	0
ClaimBuster	21230				In terms of Darfur, I agree it's genocide.	0
ClaimBuster	21231				... before the invasion, he supported it.	1
ClaimBuster	21232				We've lost 357,000 manufacturing jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	21233				So I welcome that challenge, and just watch --	0
ClaimBuster	21234				That's my vision for public education all around America.	0
ClaimBuster	21235				And I think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, Senator McCain, says more about your campaign than it says about me.	1
ClaimBuster	21236				And he is supporting me 100 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	21237				But, Peter, please understand, the liberals do not like me talking about liberal They don't like it when I say that he says he's a card carrying member.	0
ClaimBuster	21238				And maybe part of that problem is because during the 4 years of the Carter-Mondale administration medical costs in this country went up 87 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	21239				When I make a mistake I'll admit it.	0
ClaimBuster	21240				Social Security is not that tough.	0
ClaimBuster	21241				But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	21242				The woman who bought the guns for the two boys who did that killing at Columbine said that if she had had to give her name and fill out a form there, she would not have bought those guns.	1
ClaimBuster	21243				Traditionally, if you've been involved in a campaign like that, you know that the parents with kids in school are the ones that turn out and vote.	0
ClaimBuster	21244				We've got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	21245				And so I'll just be asking for support to get that put into effect.	0
ClaimBuster	21246				Ten thousand out of 12,000 Humvees aren't armored.	1
ClaimBuster	21247				And that was rejected, and that's why I voted present, because I'm willing to support a ban on late-term abortions as long as we have that exception.	1
ClaimBuster	21248				I have never answered the question, however; second, the one that says, well, tell me, what are some of those ideas?	0
ClaimBuster	21249				But I have a difference with this president.	0
ClaimBuster	21250				Look, we're in an information age.	0
ClaimBuster	21251				There was a momentary fear that he might win and that the markets went phwee, down like that.	0
ClaimBuster	21252				And number three, we need to help and support Russia and the republics in every possible way to become democratic capitalistic societies, and not just sit back and let those countries continue in turmoil.	0
ClaimBuster	21253				My five-point plan does it.	0
ClaimBuster	21254				I don't; I believe in free and fair trade, and that's the thing that saved us.	0
ClaimBuster	21255				I'd like to be the next president of the United States to support and help this great nation and to make sure that we all together remain America as the hope of the earth.	0
ClaimBuster	21256				My opponent voted against the ban.	1
ClaimBuster	21257				Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case...	0
ClaimBuster	21258				I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia?	0
ClaimBuster	21259				Now, this comes from an answer that I've made at least 50 times during this campaign to the press, when I am asked have you any ideas of what you would do if you were there?	0
ClaimBuster	21260				First you've got to have money to pay for these things.	0
ClaimBuster	21261				This is how Donald thinks.	0
ClaimBuster	21262				And just remember this, folks.	0
ClaimBuster	21263				They've had a chance to form consensus.	0
ClaimBuster	21264				As president I have to be sure that those waivers, which we're approving all over the place, are covered under the law.	1
ClaimBuster	21265				We're going to pull the country together.	0
ClaimBuster	21266				We have to be -- we have to know what we're doing.	0
ClaimBuster	21267				I'm very familiar with it.	0
ClaimBuster	21268				Let's get back to Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	21269				But among those you named, I won't actively work for the passage of any of them.	0
ClaimBuster	21270				And I really believe that it - it's far better for us and for the Soviet Union, and more importantly for the people around the world, that these two superpowers find an answer for a SALT II agreement before October three, 1977.	0
ClaimBuster	21271				You talked about it last time, you talked about a risky scheme and Vice President Gore repeated it about ten times in St. Petersburg.	1
ClaimBuster	21272				If the president were to be reelected you're going to see a $716 billion cut to Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	21273				We've gotten away fro values and the fundamentals.	0
ClaimBuster	21274				And that's why I've proposed a $4,000 tuition credit, every student, every year, in exchange for some form of community service, whether it's military service, whether it's Peace Corps, whether it's working in a community.	1
ClaimBuster	21275				I thought the president made the right decision in joining NATO and bombing Serbia.	0
ClaimBuster	21276				I think also that the American people want a balanced program that gives us long-term growth so that they're not having to take money that's desperate to themselves and their families and give it to someone else.	0
ClaimBuster	21277				And the United States needs help from other countries.	0
ClaimBuster	21278				No, I can see why people think that he changes position quite often, because he does.	1
ClaimBuster	21279				I'm glad you thought I was a standard bearer four years ago, but I wasn't.	1
ClaimBuster	21280				And he was right then, and we still are the last best hope of man on earth.	0
ClaimBuster	21281				I want to have tax relief for all people who pay the bills in America, because I think you can spend your money more wisely than the federal government can.	0
ClaimBuster	21282				I understand exactly what the Soviets are up to, but that, too, is a part of national strength.	0
ClaimBuster	21283				Mr. Stone, I have submitted an economic plan that I have worked out in concert with a number of fine economists in this country, all of whom approve it, and believe that over a five year projection, this plan can permit the extra spending for needed refurbishing of our defensive posture, that it can provide for a balanced budget by 1983 if not earlier, and that we can afford - along with the cuts that I have proposed in Government.	0
ClaimBuster	21284				I was especially moved in Richmond a few days ago when 209 of our fellow citizens got to ask us questions.	1
ClaimBuster	21285				And I made a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	21286				And I will not -- I will not under any circumstances, reduce the share that's being paid by the highest income taxpayers.	0
ClaimBuster	21287				It is a question of which administration does the right thing.	0
ClaimBuster	21288				All of these, and especially homeland security, which we'll talk about a little bit later.	0
ClaimBuster	21289				If I'm entrusted with the presidency, here are the choices that I will make.	0
ClaimBuster	21290				Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	21291				I want people to hear what he just said.	0
ClaimBuster	21292				They'll have at least two plans.	1
ClaimBuster	21293				I have no illusions about the Soviet Union leadership or the nature of that state.	0
ClaimBuster	21294				... because it's an important part of the American experience.	0
ClaimBuster	21295				And we are not equal in this treaty for one reason alone - our B-2 bombers are considered to be strategic weapons; their Backfire bombers are not.	0
ClaimBuster	21296				They're moving very rapidly because they know that it is a fast-growing world market.	0
ClaimBuster	21297				My administration worked with the Congress to create the Department of Homeland Security so we could better coordinate our borders and ports.	1
ClaimBuster	21298				Because they could go back worse than things used to be.	0
ClaimBuster	21299				We have taken the initiative, and in southern Africa today the United States is trusted by the black front-line nations and black Africa.	1
ClaimBuster	21300				Again, I'd say if they asked us to play some reasonable role, I don't know how I would respond.	0
ClaimBuster	21301				I'm planning on (inaudible) to grow.	0
ClaimBuster	21302				I believe that we ought to keep guns out of the hands of people that shouldn't have them.	0
ClaimBuster	21303				And, you know, look, I understand that Donald's been strongly supported by the NRA.	1
ClaimBuster	21304				We don't have to live like this.	0
ClaimBuster	21305				We've created five million jobs, and gone from 800 jobs a month being lost, and we are making progress.	1
ClaimBuster	21306				Until we get the surpluses off the farmer's back, however, we should have a program such as I announced, which will see that farm income holds up.	0
ClaimBuster	21307				We can lift our schools up.	0
ClaimBuster	21308				We can't dictate the terms of peace, which means that you have to be steady.	0
ClaimBuster	21309				We'd have won what Bill Clinton won.	0
ClaimBuster	21310				My plan is Social Security plus.	0
ClaimBuster	21311				Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything.	0
ClaimBuster	21312				And these aren't just representatives of the United States, they are my representatives.	0
ClaimBuster	21313				But it's important to have credibility and credibility is formed by being strong with your friends and resolute in your determination.	0
ClaimBuster	21314				Secondly, my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance.	0
ClaimBuster	21315				John, it's been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending.	1
ClaimBuster	21316				Just today, policemen was shot, two killed.	1
ClaimBuster	21317				We should make sure our legal system works.	0
ClaimBuster	21318				I hope to get a sense of should I be fortunate to be the president how my administration will react to the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	21319				She said, I can't be here until 7 or 8 o'clock at night.	1
ClaimBuster	21320				Now, whether it is rightful, on a single issue, for anyone to advocate that someone should not be elected or not, I won't take a position on that.	0
ClaimBuster	21321				So, in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said, let's help to finance the Transcontinental Railroad, let's start the National Academy of Sciences, let's start land grant colleges, because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all Americans, because if all Americans are getting opportunity, we're all going to be better off.	1
ClaimBuster	21322				So, you talk about friend?	0
ClaimBuster	21323				I see Syria with 30,000 civilians dead, Assad still in power.	1
ClaimBuster	21324				We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare.	0
ClaimBuster	21325				He been a senator for 20 years.	1
ClaimBuster	21326				It's an agenda that says we're going to reform Medicare to make sure seniors have got prescription drugs and to give seniors different options from which they can choose.	1
ClaimBuster	21327				And I think it's important to know that that was a process that was necessary to get those companies back on their feet, so they could start hiring more people.	0
ClaimBuster	21328				It's to make sure that everybody pays taxes on the income that they earn and make sure that you take whatever savings there is from the higher income levels and give it to the lower- and middle-income families.	0
ClaimBuster	21329				And you could never quite get the job done.	0
ClaimBuster	21330				And I'm a big fan of NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	21331				If it's incest, how do you draw moral judgments on that?	0
ClaimBuster	21332				I think it cannot work, won't work, and will lead to all kinds of cynical evasions of the law.	0
ClaimBuster	21333				But there are a lot of procedures that haven't kept up in Medicare with the current times.	1
ClaimBuster	21334				But that's what the election's about.	0
ClaimBuster	21335				We have people that want to fight both at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	21336				It is a great tribute to our founders that 224 years later this nation is now looked to by the peoples on every other continent and the peoples from every part of this earth as a kind of model for what their future could be.	1
ClaimBuster	21337				Result: $139 billion windfall profit to the drug companies coming out of your pockets.	1
ClaimBuster	21338				And they're going to end up getting nuclear.	0
ClaimBuster	21339				You can't do that and expect to win the war on terror.	0
ClaimBuster	21340				They have a VAT tax.	1
ClaimBuster	21341				And when we find a problem, we spend extra money to correct it.	0
ClaimBuster	21342				Now, we've got to address one of the biggest threats to our democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	21343				That's why we're going to have to go out into the housing market and we're going to have to buy up these bad loans and we're going to have to stabilize home values, and that way, Americans, like Alan, can realize the American dream and stay in their home.	0
ClaimBuster	21344				I don't have any criticism of Mr. Perot.	0
ClaimBuster	21345				Let's take advantage of the energy resources we have, as well as the energy sources for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	21346				That's why I think it's important for the United States, for instance, not to have this rigid ideological restriction on helping families around the world to be able to make a smart decision about family planning.	0
ClaimBuster	21347				These programs have been cut and slashed and butchered, and they've hurt kids all over this country.	1
ClaimBuster	21348				Just to finish briefly, I started to say that for the last eight years I've been on the National Security Council.	1
ClaimBuster	21349				Look, we need the highest possible ethical standards.	0
ClaimBuster	21350				And I want to thank the University of Denver.	0
ClaimBuster	21351				And we want to pursue that plan in a way which will bring down the level of nuclear armament, will build a more stable and more peaceful world while making choices here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	21352				Let's not, let's help, let's turn the schools back to the teachers and back to the parents and take it away from the National Education Association.	0
ClaimBuster	21353				I think there are still lot of problems in Bosnia.	0
ClaimBuster	21354				Secondly, we all committed ourselves, as have all my predecessors in the Oval Office not to permit the spread of nuclear weapons to a terrorist nation, or to any other nation that does not presently have those weapons or capabilities for explosives.	0
ClaimBuster	21355				And we're still losing a lot of auto jobs, in my judgment, because we don't have a national economic strategy that will build the industrial base of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	21356				Those are the people -- these are the greatest negotiators in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	21357				Will we ever be safe and secure again?	0
ClaimBuster	21358				Senator McCain is right that we've got to stabilize housing prices.	0
ClaimBuster	21359				They now have a plan to cover everybody and their premiums are two-thirds of the rest of the country.	1
ClaimBuster	21360				And we're making progress there.	1
ClaimBuster	21361				But our real power comes, I think, from our values.	0
ClaimBuster	21362				Those pre-conditions would apply that we wouldn't legitimize with a face to face meeting, a person like Ahmadinejad.	0
ClaimBuster	21363				And -- and I just -- so I just have to make this general point that the Bush administration, some of Senator McCain's own advisers all think this is important, and Senator McCain appears resistant.	0
ClaimBuster	21364				But because Tommy Franks did such a great job in planning the operations, we moved rapidly, and a lot of the Baathists and Saddam loyalists laid down their arms and disappeared.	1
ClaimBuster	21365				I signed a bill called the Unborn Victims of Violence Act.	1
ClaimBuster	21366				But we now have an economy that, for the first time -- well, let's put it this way: In the first half of 1980, gross national product was down a minus 3.7 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	21367				Well, let me just respond with regard to Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	21368				I think the governor is blurring housing and the homeless.	0
ClaimBuster	21369				Our expenditures for defense, our expenditures for mutual security, our expenditures for economic assistance and technical assistance are not going to get less.	0
ClaimBuster	21370				That's what I intend to do.	0
ClaimBuster	21371				But all the committees, the attorney general, the special prosecutor, all of them have given me a clean bill of health.	1
ClaimBuster	21372				And the thing I find is if I make a mistake, I admit it.	0
ClaimBuster	21373				I don't want anybody to stampede to cut the president's salary off altogether.	0
ClaimBuster	21374				That's how we built the world's greatest middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	21375				So it is a priority for me.	0
ClaimBuster	21376				And this is what's caused the great migration, where she's taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases -- not probably, who are definitely...	1
ClaimBuster	21377				And now, in the position I hold and in the world in which we live, where Embassies do get blown up in Beirut -- we're supposed to talk about that on the debate the 21st, I understand -- but I pose a threat to several hundred people if I go to church.	1
ClaimBuster	21378				They're the best, the best ever at it.	0
ClaimBuster	21379				My reading of the threat from Iran is that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, it is an existential threat to the State of Israel and it is a threat to other countries in the region because the other countries in the region will feel compelling requirement to acquire nuclear weapons as well.	0
ClaimBuster	21380				They asked him, please repair the tension -- Democrat senators -- please repair the tension...	1
ClaimBuster	21381				That's really part of your mistrust here.	0
ClaimBuster	21382				So let's stop talking about cutting Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	21383				My friend, Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, is pushing a law to make sure that Arab-Americans are treated with respect.	1
ClaimBuster	21384				I disagree with Senator McCain in how to do it, because the way Senator McCain has designed his plan, it could be a giveaway to banks if we're buying full price for mortgages that now are worth a lot less.	1
ClaimBuster	21385				"We sit down with Ahmadinejad, and he says, ""We're going to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth,"" and we say, ""No, you're not""?"	1
ClaimBuster	21386				Well, I thank you for that question, because there's no doubt that history shows us that nations that are strong militarily over time have to have a strong economy, as well.	0
ClaimBuster	21387				We don't have to settle for 23 million people struggling to find a good job.	1
ClaimBuster	21388				But I do say a majority are.	1
ClaimBuster	21389				I support the farm bill, the 1985 farm bill and spending is moving in the right direction.	0
ClaimBuster	21390				One thing I would like to say is I agree with what Senator Dole said.	0
ClaimBuster	21391				But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole.	0
ClaimBuster	21392				"And I'll tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, ""Senator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son's name on it."""	1
ClaimBuster	21393				Mr. Ayers, I don't care about an old washed-up terrorist.	0
ClaimBuster	21394				I have a plan -- not a secret plan.	0
ClaimBuster	21395				The budget was more grossly out of balance last year than ever before in the history of our country - $65 billion - primarily because our people are not at work.	1
ClaimBuster	21396				We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border.	1
ClaimBuster	21397				That is where I think the future of the world lies.	0
ClaimBuster	21398				I believe that the purpose of politics is to give people the tools to make the most of their own lives; to reinforce the values of opportunity and responsibility, and to build a sense of community so we're all working together.	0
ClaimBuster	21399				Governor Romney, you keep on trying to, you know airbrush history here.	0
ClaimBuster	21400				To repeat myself, we have this year the opportunity, which we'll realize, to produce 800 million tons of coal - an unequaled record in the history of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	21401				You guarantee they have a chance to prove they're competent.	0
ClaimBuster	21402				They want to stay free, independent perhaps of us, but certainly independent of the Communists.	0
ClaimBuster	21403				But I find more troubling than this, that on -- on the day following the assassination of the United States ambassador, the first time that's happened since 1979, when -- when we have four Americans killed there, when apparently we didn't know what happened, that the president, the day after that happened, flies to Las Vegas for a political fund-raiser, then the next day to Colorado for another event, other political event.	1
ClaimBuster	21404				I don't have a dog in this fight, but I'd like to get in on this.	0
ClaimBuster	21405				There are a lot of young workers at our rallies we go to that when they hear I'll trust them at their option to be able to manage, under certain guidelines, some of their own money to get a better rate of return so that they'll have a retirement plan in the future, they begin to nod their heads and they want a different attitude in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	21406				Under that, this year, we have seen a $21 billion reduction in the deficit from last year, based mainly on the increased revenues the Government is getting without raising tax rates.	1
ClaimBuster	21407				I wanted to give Clinton the power to use force if necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	21408				We supported a a crime bill that had 60 death penalties including, including the death penalty for drug kingpins.	1
ClaimBuster	21409				In fact, we put together a $5.6 trillion surplus in the '90s that was for the purpose of saving Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	21410				But large businesses that can afford it, we've got a choice.	0
ClaimBuster	21411				All these things take a few minutes.	0
ClaimBuster	21412				And may I say, too, that I would trust that Senator Kennedy would change his position on this - change it; because as long as he as a major presidential candidate continues to suggest that we are going to turn over these islands, he is only encouraging the aggressors - the Chinese Communist and the Soviet aggressors - to press the United States, to press us to the point where war would be inevitable.	0
ClaimBuster	21413				And I think it's very damaging to our country for Mr. Ford to have turned over this responsibility to the secretary of state.	0
ClaimBuster	21414				This is an issue that will require a new attitude.	0
ClaimBuster	21415				Let me first tell you that the best way for Iraq to be safe and secure is for Iraqi citizens to be trained to do the job.	0
ClaimBuster	21416				I'll continue, in the four years, to continue to try to work to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	21417				It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	21418				And frankly, now we're going to do it right.	0
ClaimBuster	21419				That's math that doesn't add up.	0
ClaimBuster	21420				And so call off all those pickets out there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations.	0
ClaimBuster	21421				In the meantime, I'm going to continue praying that they'll carne home.	0
ClaimBuster	21422				Early childhood education, which closes the achievement gap, so that every child is prepared for school, every dollar we invest in that, we end up getting huge benefits with improved reading scores, reduced dropout rates, reduced delinquency rates.	0
ClaimBuster	21423				I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court.	0
ClaimBuster	21424				And the way you define small businesses includes folks at the very top.	1
ClaimBuster	21425				So the point is --	0
ClaimBuster	21426				I understand how hard it is to start a small business.	0
ClaimBuster	21427				But it's not getting out because there are too few debates.	0
ClaimBuster	21428				There is an abundant supply of coal in America.	1
ClaimBuster	21429				An incredible number of young people are active in supporting my effort because they are deeply concerned that we have taken the American dream from them.	0
ClaimBuster	21430				Ross had his hand up.	1
ClaimBuster	21431				We're a serious debtor nation.	1
ClaimBuster	21432				Every time there's been an out-of-bounds remark made by a Republican, no matter where they are, I have repudiated them.	1
ClaimBuster	21433				It is because we have not grown.	0
ClaimBuster	21434				And I can prove it.	0
ClaimBuster	21435				In 1985, I was one of the first Democrats -- broke with my party.	1
ClaimBuster	21436				And secondly, it's a fundamental misunderstanding to say that the war on terror is only Osama bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	21437				But I'm not going to make any excuses.	0
ClaimBuster	21438				That they're appointed for life and that they ought to look at the Constitution as sacred.	0
ClaimBuster	21439				I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts, and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also.	0
ClaimBuster	21440				Now then, to nail it, there's one way out -- a growing, expanding job base.	0
ClaimBuster	21441				Now, the thing I love about it -- I'm just a businessman.	0
ClaimBuster	21442				Well, let me first of all talk about our diplomats, because they serve all around the world and do an incredible job in a very dangerous situation.	0
ClaimBuster	21443				Is India going to win the economic struggle or is China going to win it?	0
ClaimBuster	21444				You mentioned the Heller decision.	1
ClaimBuster	21445				But I think it's important to step back and think about what happened in Libya.	0
ClaimBuster	21446				But I'm not going to continue to throw money at a problem.	0
ClaimBuster	21447				I made a good selection.	0
ClaimBuster	21448				We have to get a handle on it.	0
ClaimBuster	21449				I refer to the fact that in 1958, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I'm very familiar with the position that the United States took in negotiating with the Chinese Communists on these two islands.	1
ClaimBuster	21450				But a president must always be willing to use troops.	0
ClaimBuster	21451				The other called it untrue.	1
ClaimBuster	21452				You know, going to a Buddhist temple and then claiming it wasn't a fundraiser isn't my view of responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	21453				I'm sure he believes just as deeply that his will move that way.	0
ClaimBuster	21454				Yes, there are big problems, and yes, people are hurting.	0
ClaimBuster	21455				Can I say just one other thing here?	0
ClaimBuster	21456				I'm going to stop other things.	0
ClaimBuster	21457				I hope we can talk more about that.	0
ClaimBuster	21458				That's why we have to balance the budget, and I will tell you how I'm going to pay for anything I promise you, line by line.	0
ClaimBuster	21459				You can't talk about it rationally.	0
ClaimBuster	21460				That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose.	1
ClaimBuster	21461				Next Tuesday is Election Day.	1
ClaimBuster	21462				I'll get Osama bin Laden, my friends.	0
ClaimBuster	21463				We have now employed eighty-eight million people in America, the largest number in the history of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	21464				We don't know whether it's going to work or not, but we keep giving the incentives.	0
ClaimBuster	21465				Now, will you sit down with us and once and for all get rid, all of us, of these nuclear weapons and free mankind from that threat?''	0
ClaimBuster	21466				We didn't guard the foreign office, where you might have found information about weapons of mass destruction.	1
ClaimBuster	21467				If you do change your behavior, then it is possible for you to re-join the community of nations.	0
ClaimBuster	21468				Ambassador Stevens -- Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help.	1
ClaimBuster	21469				Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi.	0
ClaimBuster	21470				He really didn't have a new economic program until over 1300 days into his presidency, and not all of his health care initiative has been presented to the Congress even now.	1
ClaimBuster	21471				I√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢m on record as saying at some point in time I hope our European friends become the peacekeepers in Bosnia and in the Balkans.	0
ClaimBuster	21472				"One vote doesn't make a difference."""	0
ClaimBuster	21473				I've heard a lot of criticism about America, and our national security policy, and all that, and much of that criticism is justified.	0
ClaimBuster	21474				We have got to unite and pull together, and there's nothing we can't do.	0
ClaimBuster	21475				I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment.	1
ClaimBuster	21476				You looked at me like my clock was up.	0
ClaimBuster	21477				It's making the country poorer, which is why I answered the gentleman the way I did before.	0
ClaimBuster	21478				I believe we can increase investment and reduce the deficit at the same time, if we not only ask the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their share; we also provide over $100 billion in tax relief, in terms of incentives for new plants, new small businesses, new technologies, new housing, and for middle class families; and we have $140 billion of spending cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	21479				It's going to grow 39 percent, and Social Security is going to grow 34 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	21480				We had civil administrators come in to set up their ways of building their towns back.	1
ClaimBuster	21481				But I am familiar with the statement, and it was made by one of the top-ranking officials of that organization.	1
ClaimBuster	21482				That's probably not going to survive you get that rate down to 25 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	21483				I mean for instance, we can now, by virtue of new technology actually get all the energy we need in North America without having to go to the -- the Arabs or the Venezuelans or anyone else.	1
ClaimBuster	21484				We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country.	0
ClaimBuster	21485				And I will not go in there and suggest changes in Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	21486				We would have had the U.N. inspectors.	0
ClaimBuster	21487				And he will do very very well.	0
ClaimBuster	21488				I advocated last May in a speech at the United Nations that we move immediately as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all nuclear devices, both weapons and peaceful devices; that we not ship any more atomic fuel to a country that refuses to comply with strict controls over the waste which can be reprocessed into explosives.	1
ClaimBuster	21489				But, you know, coming from you, who, you know, in the past has threatened extinction for North Korea and, you know, sung songs about bombing Iran, I don't know, you know, how credible that is.	1
ClaimBuster	21490				Here's what I'll do: Number one, the borders are more leaking today than they were before 9/11.	1
ClaimBuster	21491				It's called bait and switch.	0
ClaimBuster	21492				Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO.	1
ClaimBuster	21493				The Vice President and I disagree on this.	1
ClaimBuster	21494				Can they rely on us?	0
ClaimBuster	21495				Arab-Americans are racially profiled in what is called secret evidence.	1
ClaimBuster	21496				You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack, it was an act of terror.	1
ClaimBuster	21497				We need to do more and better.	0
ClaimBuster	21498				He has raised taxes several times.	1
ClaimBuster	21499				Secondly, that you get a $2,000 rebate from the government if you're a family of $30,000 or less -- it scales down as you get higher -- that you can use to purchase health care in the private markets.	1
ClaimBuster	21500				He wants to put all our eggs in one basket and give that basket to the major oil companies.	0
ClaimBuster	21501				I think you ought to get the break.	0
ClaimBuster	21502				Was there an effort to bring all the allies together around that?	0
ClaimBuster	21503				The technology is there and we have to drill now.	0
ClaimBuster	21504				And if not, I'll get rid of it.	0
ClaimBuster	21505				Health care is priority number two, because that broken health care system is bad not only for families, but it's making our businesses less competitive.	1
ClaimBuster	21506				We're not going to make those kinds of mistakes.	0
ClaimBuster	21507				That is going to be a big difference between my opponent and me.	0
ClaimBuster	21508				And we've won just about every case that we've filed, that has been decided.	0
ClaimBuster	21509				It is important because the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court.	0
ClaimBuster	21510				But we're bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	21511				Putin has outsmarted her in Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	21512				It is a decision finally that the Nationalists should make and I believe that we should consult with them and attempt to work out a plan by which the line is drawn at the island of Formosa.	0
ClaimBuster	21513				I come from the school of thought that says when people have more money in their pocket during economic times, it increases demand or investment.	0
ClaimBuster	21514				And I'm glad that the Congress moved on this drug bill and have finally called for that related to these narcotics drug kingpins.	0
ClaimBuster	21515				And so I do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said -- I'm proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran.	0
ClaimBuster	21516				Now they have to try harder if they want to keep getting federal funds.	0
ClaimBuster	21517				By the way, I went there once, and we went inside and drove in, and there was a huge poster.	1
ClaimBuster	21518				Robin, I'm going to answer your question.	0
ClaimBuster	21519				He introduced some 300 bills and he's passed five.	1
ClaimBuster	21520				And then after the Republican dirty tricks group got through with me I'm another person, which I consider an absolutely sick operation.	0
ClaimBuster	21521				I know something about prosecuting.	0
ClaimBuster	21522				Now, what can we do?	0
ClaimBuster	21523				I've had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	21524				Senator McCain's absolutely right: The D.C. school system is in terrible shape, and it has been for a very long time.	0
ClaimBuster	21525				We turn it over to the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	21526				They can take it anywhere, across state lines.	0
ClaimBuster	21527				Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	21528				His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they've ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two.	1
ClaimBuster	21529				He then wants to spend another $2 trillion on military spending that our military is not asking for.	1
ClaimBuster	21530				That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of.	1
ClaimBuster	21531				Nobody is even talking about that.	0
ClaimBuster	21532				Governor Rockefeller has been far more critical in June of our position in the world than I have been.	0
ClaimBuster	21533				We ought to say this is good.	0
ClaimBuster	21534				Look, I am a job creator, not a job destroyer.	0
ClaimBuster	21535				And uh - with that uh - in that framework would befit the - any improvements in the programs.	0
ClaimBuster	21536				To stay strong, to stay at peace, to raise high the banner of human rights, to set an example for the rest of the world, to let our deep beliefs and commitments be felt by others in other nations, is my plan for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	21537				"I think that's a good idea"" -- four years ago."	0
ClaimBuster	21538				So that's the next area I'm different than President Bush.	0
ClaimBuster	21539				But let me give you another example of a free trade agreement that Senator Obama opposes.	0
ClaimBuster	21540				And that's the economic package again.	0
ClaimBuster	21541				Their idea was to charge everybody more out-of-pocket costs in their budget that I vetoed.	1
ClaimBuster	21542				Do you know that it's tripled in the last five years?	1
ClaimBuster	21543				And I vowed something because I learned something from Vietnam.	0
ClaimBuster	21544				Until we control health care costs, we're not going to control the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	21545				We would have had sanctions.	0
ClaimBuster	21546				And why I think it is outrageous -- first of all, it isn't true.	0
ClaimBuster	21547				Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order.	0
ClaimBuster	21548				So I believe that the policies that I recommend came under the general heading of strengthening the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	21549				Now, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is he'll maintain traditional Medicare alongside it.	1
ClaimBuster	21550				This is one of the biggest challenges of our times.	0
ClaimBuster	21551				Mr. Nixon earlier indicated that he would defend Quemoy and Matsu even if the attack on these islands, two miles off the coast of China, were not part of a general attack an Formosa and the Pescadores.	1
ClaimBuster	21552				So, I think some of those charges are missing the point.	0
ClaimBuster	21553				Peace in the Middle East is in our nation's interests.	0
ClaimBuster	21554				And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes.	1
ClaimBuster	21555				So should I be fortunate enough to earn your vote, I also understand -- I want to open up markets, but I also understand that farming is a part of our national security.	0
ClaimBuster	21556				Will we use our prosperity to enrich not just the few, but all of our families?	0
ClaimBuster	21557				I've got a good relation with Vladimir.	0
ClaimBuster	21558				But I wouldn't designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check.	0
ClaimBuster	21559				We ought to make one last effort.	0
ClaimBuster	21560				And when I speak of presidential leadership, I refer for example to our attitude on the sit-in strikes.	0
ClaimBuster	21561				Because if you do, it's an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages and to blackmail us.	0
ClaimBuster	21562				I want to increase spending 14 percent, that's how simple it is.	0
ClaimBuster	21563				We cut taxes for middle-class families by about $3,600.	1
ClaimBuster	21564				If you don't agree -- leave this room with anything else tonight and if the people watching us don't leave with anything else, I hope you will leave with this.	0
ClaimBuster	21565				As a matter of fact, over 4 years, they've missed the mark by nearly $600 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	21566				We want to work with them and build a new relationship, and they with us.	0
ClaimBuster	21567				This is not because I didn't have commitment to education.	0
ClaimBuster	21568				As to what we might do, and find in further savings cuts, no, we're not going to starve the hungry.	0
ClaimBuster	21569				Saddam Hussein didn't attack us.	1
ClaimBuster	21570				The question is for the next president, are we making good judgments about how to keep America safe precisely because sending our military into battle is such an enormous step.	0
ClaimBuster	21571				And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	21572				Do you know that he voted for every increase in spending that I saw come across the floor of the United States Senate while we were working to eliminate these pork barrel earmarks?	1
ClaimBuster	21573				"At one point, while you were focused on Iraq, you said well, we can ""muddle through"" Afghanistan."	1
ClaimBuster	21574				We set up a national ceiling on health care costs tied to inflation and population growth set by health care providers, not by the government.	1
ClaimBuster	21575				And not only the training in police procedures, but human relations.	0
ClaimBuster	21576				This needs to be changed.	0
ClaimBuster	21577				A senator runs every 6 years.	1
ClaimBuster	21578				You know, my grandmother -- some of you know -- helped to raise me.	1
ClaimBuster	21579				You can't change the dynamics on the ground if you've criticized the brave leader of Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	21580				And the answer, of course, is that Communist espionage goes on all the time.	0
ClaimBuster	21581				Now he is trying to not release the votes and then go straight to a so-called runoff election without even announcing the results of the first vote.	1
ClaimBuster	21582				The voters should assume I have no litmus test on that issue or any other issue.	0
ClaimBuster	21583				That's what leadership is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	21584				Thank you, Jim, very much.	0
ClaimBuster	21585				They concluded that my plan would cover everybody and his would leave 27 million behind by the year 2000 and that my plan in the next 12 years would save $2.2 trillion in public and private money to reinvest in this economy and the average family would save $1200 a year under the plan that I offered without any erosion in the quality of health care	1
ClaimBuster	21586				I referred to the Dingle-Norwood bill.	1
ClaimBuster	21587				I don't think he was misleading when he called Iraq a grave threat in the fall of 2002.	1
ClaimBuster	21588				Mr. President, have you looked at your pension?	0
ClaimBuster	21589				But I think it's important just to remember a little bit of history.	0
ClaimBuster	21590				When I went to the United States Senate, I asked for an assignment to the Armed Services Committee.	1
ClaimBuster	21591				We have to respect one another.	0
ClaimBuster	21592				Secondly, we ought to have treatment on demand.	0
ClaimBuster	21593				You know, there's a main stream in American politics and you sit right on the far left bank.	0
ClaimBuster	21594				And I would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then.	0
ClaimBuster	21595				And I was taking on discrimination against African-American kids in schools.	1
ClaimBuster	21596				I have supported or voted for tax cuts over 600 times.	1
ClaimBuster	21597				I want to -- obviously in the egregious cases we need to enforce civil rights law, but we need to make sure that internal affairs divisions at the local level do their job and be given a chance to do their job.	0
ClaimBuster	21598				I have fought against it.	1
ClaimBuster	21599				I'll give you an example.	0
ClaimBuster	21600				They have to abide by their treaty with Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	21601				I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives.	0
ClaimBuster	21602				But the Russians, I think we can deal with them but they've got to understand that they're facing a very firm and determined United States of America that will defend our interests and that of other countries in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	21603				So you get a pretty good sense of where he's heading if he were to appoint somebody.	0
ClaimBuster	21604				And Governor Romney, our alliances have never been stronger, in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel, where we have unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation, including dealing with the Iranian threat.	1
ClaimBuster	21605				We have to have the benefits high for those that are low income, but for higher income people, we're going to have to lower some of the benefits.	0
ClaimBuster	21606				Sometimes you just have to do that because you know it's right for the country over the long run.	0
ClaimBuster	21607				And it seems to me what we need to do is to talk about not only tobacco but drugs, because drug use between 12- and 17-year-olds has doubled in this administration in the last 44 months.	1
ClaimBuster	21608				The point is -- the point is that we can fix our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	21609				And in order to have the best intelligence in the world to know who the terrorists are and where they are and what they're plotting, you've got to have the best cooperation you've ever had in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	21610				A lot of them are mentally sick.	0
ClaimBuster	21611				You know, I was in New Hampshire.	1
ClaimBuster	21612				And that makes them advantageous in the marketplace.	1
ClaimBuster	21613				The Soviet Union refused to agree to that, and we went to the summit and it was disastrous.	1
ClaimBuster	21614				When he fought regulatory reform that cost the average family 6 to $7,000 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	21615				No, this war is a matter of using every asset at our disposal to keep the American people protected.	0
ClaimBuster	21616				Now let's expand it so more people can succeed as parents and in the work force.	0
ClaimBuster	21617				Every parent I know would acquire health insurance for their children if they could.	0
ClaimBuster	21618				It's not a government plan.	1
ClaimBuster	21619				I will have an ethical office in the White House that will be under the President's personal concern.	0
ClaimBuster	21620				Kitty and I are very grateful to all of you for the warmth and the hospitality that you've given to us in your homes and communities all across this country.	0
ClaimBuster	21621				We happen to have a statute on the books that's a hate crimes statute in Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	21622				And there was a terrible reaction internationally to Mr. Bush saying he was going to give us 4 more years of trickle-down economics--another across-the- board tax cut and most of it going to the wealthy, with no real guarantee of investment.	1
ClaimBuster	21623				And I am ultimately responsible for what's taking place there because these are my folks, and I'm the one who has to greet those coffins when they come home.	0
ClaimBuster	21624				Well, there's a law pending called the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.	1
ClaimBuster	21625				I will say again: you cannot control health care costs simply by cutting Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	21626				I am not for national registration of firearms.	1
ClaimBuster	21627				But I do not believe that conservation alone is the answer to the present energy problem, because all you're doing then is staving off, by a short time, the day when you would come to the end of the energy supply.	0
ClaimBuster	21628				That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks.	1
ClaimBuster	21629				Since I did this -- this was a year ago -- all of a sudden, they're paying.	1
ClaimBuster	21630				I think you believe in them.	0
ClaimBuster	21631				We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals.	0
ClaimBuster	21632				This is -- this is an important part of the world for us.	0
ClaimBuster	21633				Of course he encourages and other people encourage contacts, and negotiations, and all other things.	0
ClaimBuster	21634				Everybody remembers that; people know what happened.	0
ClaimBuster	21635				But because of some of the mistakes that have been made -- and I give Senator McCain great credit on the torture issue, for having identified that as something that undermines our long-term security -- because of those things, we, I think, are going to have a lot of work to do in the next administration to restore that sense that America is that shining beacon on a hill.	1
ClaimBuster	21636				But we tried this before, promising people an election year tax cut that's not paid for.	1
ClaimBuster	21637				That's why he called him a grave threat.	0
ClaimBuster	21638				This is something that Senator Kennedy and all Americans must know.	0
ClaimBuster	21639				This is an administration that's had no plan.	0
ClaimBuster	21640				If you're 10 we'll put you here, 12 you put here.	1
ClaimBuster	21641				We can build a new modern electric grid.	0
ClaimBuster	21642				The point is, the big winner is going to be Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	21643				I don't have any experience in gridlock government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else.	0
ClaimBuster	21644				The question is what we're going to do in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	21645				So now I want to hire another 100,000 new math and science teachers, and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now.	0
ClaimBuster	21646				Twenty-three million Americans still struggling to find a good job.	1
ClaimBuster	21647				The constitutional amendment for voluntary prayer in school, in my view would be a great idea.	0
ClaimBuster	21648				They're using cheap hand guns.	1
ClaimBuster	21649				I wrote the anti-terrorist report for this government.	1
ClaimBuster	21650				I think they stand for civil rights.	0
ClaimBuster	21651				I believe very much in our renewable capabilities; ethanol, wind, solar will be an important part of our energy mix.	0
ClaimBuster	21652				I would love to respond.	0
ClaimBuster	21653				Surplus is money -- more money than needed.	0
ClaimBuster	21654				Secondly, I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers' salaries.	0
ClaimBuster	21655				We gave them $150 billion back.	1
ClaimBuster	21656				They're in the civilian labor market and they're not fighting anywhere around the world today.	1
ClaimBuster	21657				When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach.	0
ClaimBuster	21658				We've got to start also holding people accountable, and we've got to reward people who succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	21659				And hopefully in the next segment you could lay that to rest.	0
ClaimBuster	21660				We don't know what's going to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	21661				Why don't you give back the money?	0
ClaimBuster	21662				Never wanted to commit troops.	0
ClaimBuster	21663				And it also says that you're going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care.	1
ClaimBuster	21664				But do not erode out of the system the thousand points of light.	0
ClaimBuster	21665				Who does he owe money to?	0
ClaimBuster	21666				Part of the Arizona law said that law enforcement officers could stop folks because they suspected maybe they looked like they might be undocumented workers and check their papers.	1
ClaimBuster	21667				I sometimes think he's like the witch doctor that gets mad when a good doctor comes along with a cure that'll work.	0
ClaimBuster	21668				But they come to me and they say, please get the Congress to stop passing so many mandates telling us how to control things.	0
ClaimBuster	21669				We got away, we got into this feeling that value- free education was the thing.	0
ClaimBuster	21670				As a matter of fact, I'm the first governor in the history of my state to fund that pension system, and I'm very proud of that.	1
ClaimBuster	21671				I think this election has to be geared toward the future.	0
ClaimBuster	21672				So now there are five voices speaking to Kim Jong Il, not just one.	1
ClaimBuster	21673				This president and his administration have told you and all of us it's not a question of when, it's a question of -- excuse me -- not a question of if, it's a question of when.	0
ClaimBuster	21674				Now, the facts are we have to fix it.	0
ClaimBuster	21675				And with inspiration and hard work we can achieve great things.	0
ClaimBuster	21676				We need a strong economic package; we need a tax cut; we need the $500 child credit, and we'll have that soon.	0
ClaimBuster	21677				And therefore, that was the reason that I would not uh - identify any particular course of action uh - when I responded to a question a week or so ago.	0
ClaimBuster	21678				He should be held accountable.	0
ClaimBuster	21679				His words amount to genocide incitation.	0
ClaimBuster	21680				Secretary Clinton has done an extraordinary job.	0
ClaimBuster	21681				But that's not the question.	0
ClaimBuster	21682				But also, I think it is safe to say that we do have sources of energy that have not yet been used or found.	1
ClaimBuster	21683				She talks about solar panels.	1
ClaimBuster	21684				I get the last word (inaudible) I hope.	0
ClaimBuster	21685				If we negotiate from a position where the power balance or wave is moving away from us, it's extremely difficult to reach a successful decision on Berlin as well as the other questions.	0
ClaimBuster	21686				And if you imagine just one company trying to deal with that, now imagine a million companies all across the country.	0
ClaimBuster	21687				I want to make sure the education system fulfills its hope and promise.	0
ClaimBuster	21688				And we need a measure -- and I will support a measure -- that brings about those objectives but avoids that one aspect that I think is very serious.	0
ClaimBuster	21689				The death penalty is a very serious business, Leo.	0
ClaimBuster	21690				One of the things I've done in Texas is I've been able to put together a good team of people.	1
ClaimBuster	21691				But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn't there, but possibly she's consulted.	0
ClaimBuster	21692				Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence?	0
ClaimBuster	21693				This -- this is a critical opportunity for America.	0
ClaimBuster	21694				... just a quick follow-up on this.	0
ClaimBuster	21695				Like Kyoto Treaty would have done.	0
ClaimBuster	21696				And so we have to understand that we can't just surrender and lose jobs year in and year out.	0
ClaimBuster	21697				We're going to build alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	21698				You know, I could talk for the rest of the debate -- I know I don't have the time to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	21699				So how much did you cut (inaudible)?	0
ClaimBuster	21700				We've got to help Russia succeed in its revolution and all of its republics.	0
ClaimBuster	21701				We can also have a- an end to the extremes.	0
ClaimBuster	21702				Here we are with a government that's been dealing with a drug-running Panamanian dictator.	1
ClaimBuster	21703				I want to do -- I don't like this idea of these boards.	0
ClaimBuster	21704				The president has never said whether or not he would do that.	1
ClaimBuster	21705				And I think they looked and thought, well, that's an unusual honor to receive from the President of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	21706				That's why I put out a five-point plan that gets America 12 million new jobs in four years and rising take-home pay.	1
ClaimBuster	21707				When we went out to south central in Los Angeles -- some of you may remember the riots there.	0
ClaimBuster	21708				But as well, we need to continue to pursue adult stem-cell research.	0
ClaimBuster	21709				We also have to have in mind something else with regard to this whole situation in the world, and that is: that as America moves forward, we not only must think in terms of fighting Communism, but we must also think primarily in terms of the interests of these countries.	0
ClaimBuster	21710				My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have.	0
ClaimBuster	21711				Can you run through the list again?	0
ClaimBuster	21712				First, he says he's for medical liability reform, particularly for OB/GYNs.	1
ClaimBuster	21713				It will require bigger cuts in Medicare than I vetoed last time.	1
ClaimBuster	21714				Now I'm back to square one.	0
ClaimBuster	21715				We seem to come full circle again.	0
ClaimBuster	21716				And so I am not going to furlough men like Willie Horton, and I would meet with their, the victims of his last escapade, the rape and the brutalization of the family down there in Maryland.	0
ClaimBuster	21717				I have supported character education programs in our schools, drug-free schools programs.	1
ClaimBuster	21718				Jim, let's -- we've gone on a lot of topics there, and so it's going to take a minute to go from Medicaid to schools...	0
ClaimBuster	21719				So some of it is unfair.	0
ClaimBuster	21720				Bear in mind also, Milosevic has been indicted as a war criminal and he should be held accountable for his actions.	1
ClaimBuster	21721				We are moving forward with negotiations and, you see, I just think it would be dumb negotiating policy with the Soviets to cut out one or the other of the two options right now.	0
ClaimBuster	21722				We need to increase pressure time, and time again on Iran because anything other than a -- a -- a solution to this, which says -- which stops this -- this nuclear folly of theirs, is unacceptable to America.	0
ClaimBuster	21723				And today, there are four to seven nuclear weapons in the hands of North Korea.	1
ClaimBuster	21724				And with all of the money they have, we're defending them, and they're not paying?	0
ClaimBuster	21725				The Vice President suggested a number of things.	1
ClaimBuster	21726				"I think John McCain called the energy bill the ""No Lobbyist Left Behind"" bill."	1
ClaimBuster	21727				No, let -- let -- let me go back and speak to the points that the president made and -- and -- and let's get them correct.	0
ClaimBuster	21728				But they're basically American, I believe in them.	0
ClaimBuster	21729				I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	21730				And it means that we can have tough, vigorous debates around issues.	0
ClaimBuster	21731				This will give them a chance to choose their own futures, not have Senator Obama and government decide that for them.	0
ClaimBuster	21732				"Some say, ""well, you're a little old fashioned."""	0
ClaimBuster	21733				We have to make it possible.	0
ClaimBuster	21734				She's a reformer through and through.	0
ClaimBuster	21735				Then you have to look at our proposals for our economy, not $860 billion in new spending, but for the kinds of reforms that keep people in their jobs, get middle-income Americans working again, and getting our economy moving again.	0
ClaimBuster	21736				And we can do so in a way that marshals our forces, that provides real support for state and local law enforcement officers who have not been getting that support, and do it in a way which will bring down violence in this nation, will help our youngsters to stay away from drugs, will stop this avalanche of drugs that's pouring into the country, and will make it possible for our kids and our families to grow up in safe and secure and decent neighborhoods.	0
ClaimBuster	21737				We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost.	1
ClaimBuster	21738				There's a sense of American occupation.	0
ClaimBuster	21739				Now give me 1 second...	0
ClaimBuster	21740				You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids.	0
ClaimBuster	21741				And this is the reason why, working with Israel, we have created the strongest military and intelligence cooperation between our two countries in history.	1
ClaimBuster	21742				I think that is something we have to take seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	21743				It means having intelligent decisions that keep our prosperity going and shepherds that economic strength so that we can provide that leadership role.	0
ClaimBuster	21744				I thought we were talking about immigration.	0
ClaimBuster	21745				You go upstate New York.	0
ClaimBuster	21746				And if you care about the future of America, if you care about your future, just don't do it.	0
ClaimBuster	21747				I'm going to do those things, because that's what's right in America: Help workers to transition in every respect.	0
ClaimBuster	21748				I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.	1
ClaimBuster	21749				And when we are strong and when we are first, then freedom gains; then the prospects for peace increase; then the prospects for our society gain.	0
ClaimBuster	21750				We've changed for the first time since FDR -- since FDR we had the -- we've always had the strategy of saying we could fight in two conflicts at once.	1
ClaimBuster	21751				The president and I share the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman.	1
ClaimBuster	21752				It's an honor to be here with you, and I appreciate the chance to be with the president.	0
ClaimBuster	21753				Incredibly, incredibly Senator Obama didn't go to Iraq for 900 days and never asked for a meeting with General Petraeus.	1
ClaimBuster	21754				We've got to deal with this problem, and those of us who want to be your President should tell you now what we're going to do, so you can make a judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	21755				I'll get incomes up again.	0
ClaimBuster	21756				I'm not for gay marriage.	0
ClaimBuster	21757				But here's the point he misses.	0
ClaimBuster	21758				And they told me they could not have performed their duty, the duty we all expect of them, if they did not have the ability to communicate with each other under the Patriot Act.	1
ClaimBuster	21759				We feel that you can hold the line and restrain federal spending, give a tax reduction and still have a balanced budget by 1978.	0
ClaimBuster	21760				But he never apologizes for anything to anyone.	0
ClaimBuster	21761				Gonna have to take a look at all the managed care going on in California, or we're going to end up losing our best care that we have in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	21762				The Social Security system was based on a false premise, with regard to how fast the number of workers would increase and how fast the number of retirees would increase.	1
ClaimBuster	21763				I think somebody who doesn't want me to be president might have run that ad.	0
ClaimBuster	21764				Now, you can come back in and you can become a citizen.	0
ClaimBuster	21765				I appoint people of independence and integrity and intelligence, people who will be a credit to the Bench.	0
ClaimBuster	21766				You don't like the answer, but it's an answer.	0
ClaimBuster	21767				The new economic revitalization program that we have in mind, which will be implemented next year, would result in tax credits which would let business invest in new tools and new factories to create even more new jobs - about one million in the next two years.	0
ClaimBuster	21768				We all remember Pearl Harbor.	0
ClaimBuster	21769				That's a lot of marijuana.	0
ClaimBuster	21770				We've seen progress over the past several years.	1
ClaimBuster	21771				Social Security is totally funded by the payroll tax levied on employer and employee.	1
ClaimBuster	21772				"The president stood right here in this hall four years ago, and he was asked a question by somebody just like you, ""Under what circumstances would you send people to war?"""	1
ClaimBuster	21773				DISC, you said, was about 1.4 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	21774				And they're over there, not over here.	1
ClaimBuster	21775				But this can't keep on going.	0
ClaimBuster	21776				This is just 1 of 1000.	1
ClaimBuster	21777				I hate to interrupt you, but at some point...	0
ClaimBuster	21778				We're going to balance the budget, by the year 2002.	0
ClaimBuster	21779				This is primarily an ideological battle - a battle for the minds and the hearts and the souls of men.	0
ClaimBuster	21780				I would like to, of course, and I presume this administration would as well.	0
ClaimBuster	21781				I say that the American people don't want to go back to those policies.	0
ClaimBuster	21782				Office estimate that there is probably tens of billions of dollars that is lost in fraud alone, and they have added that waste adds even more to that.	1
ClaimBuster	21783				The ideas I express are mine.	0
ClaimBuster	21784				Second reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for it.	1
ClaimBuster	21785				We certainly must maintain an engagement there.	0
ClaimBuster	21786				It's a fundamental difference between what we believe.	0
ClaimBuster	21787				I'm tired of being told we can't.	0
ClaimBuster	21788				Whether or not one makes decisions based on sound principles or whether or not you rely upon polls and focus groups on how to decide what the course of action is.	0
ClaimBuster	21789				And these are things I think that will go a long way toward helping America build a stronger economy and a better tax system.	0
ClaimBuster	21790				Well, the resurgence of Russia is one of the central issues that we're going to have to deal with in the next presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	21791				I wouldn't want to be a liberal either, Mr. President, but you're stuck with it because that's your record, that's your record in Arkansas: The biggest tax increase in history.	1
ClaimBuster	21792				First of all, I don't see how it's possible for a one-third of a body, such as the Republicans have in the House and the Senate to stop two-thirds, if the two-thirds are adequately led.	0
ClaimBuster	21793				They feel that the levels we're operating at and the reductions that I have proposed are proper.	0
ClaimBuster	21794				He won't support freeing local districts from the strings of federal money.	0
ClaimBuster	21795				I'm totally focussed on the fact that we may have bank failures and nobody answered it.	0
ClaimBuster	21796				It's a time for unity.	0
ClaimBuster	21797				That's not where we are today.	0
ClaimBuster	21798				Mr. President, I'm glad to be here with you again to share similarities and differences with the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	21799				And I think most people know my position on the sanctity of life.	0
ClaimBuster	21800				But the important thing is what are we going to do now?	0
ClaimBuster	21801				"And the ""Los Angeles Times"" spent a lot of ink going into that."	0
ClaimBuster	21802				But it's the Internal Revenue Service which estimates now that we aren't collecting $100 billion or more in taxes owed in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	21803				But when we find children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach, instead of saying oh, this is okay in America just to shuffle poor kids through schools, there has to be a consequence.	0
ClaimBuster	21804				And for the 5 years previous to our taking office, taxes doubled in the United States, and the budgets increased $318 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	21805				Africa is now the emerging area of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	21806				And it's all a question of what our priorities are.	0
ClaimBuster	21807				The reason you didn't is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do.	0
ClaimBuster	21808				Miss Quinn, I would be very happy to accept the challenge of your question tonight, to tell the voters of this country exactly what I think it's going to cost, because I believe that all too often in past elections, politicians have simply been promising people things that they cannot deliver.	0
ClaimBuster	21809				And the president of South Korea went back to South Korea bewildered and embarrassed because it went against his policy.	0
ClaimBuster	21810				Tom, wave like that and I'll look at you.	0
ClaimBuster	21811				So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.	0
ClaimBuster	21812				And I just told you the facts, sir.	1
ClaimBuster	21813				But at the time that uh - I submitted the Sinai agreement to the Congress of the United States, I submitted every single document that was applicable to the Sinai II agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	21814				But we can do them all at once.	0
ClaimBuster	21815				Well, I don't mind paying a little more.	0
ClaimBuster	21816				I mean, the president received a letter from 38 Democrat senators saying the tensions with Israel were a real problem.	1
ClaimBuster	21817				I wish America had that kind of record and I think most people looking at us tonight would like it if we had more jobs and a lower spending burden on the government.	0
ClaimBuster	21818				And you'll find a tort reform plan.	0
ClaimBuster	21819				No, I think you'll see --	0
ClaimBuster	21820				It's a fundamental difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	21821				I don't rule out modernization, and there are discussions going on now in the Congress, I know with the Pentagon, about a less expensive modernized land-based leg of the triad.	0
ClaimBuster	21822				We agreed in principle on an insurance agreement, and we're working on three or four other areas now, but the way you have to do it is make sure you're competitive.	1
ClaimBuster	21823				What will determine whether Senator Kennedy or I, if I am elected, was a great president?	0
ClaimBuster	21824				Japan is trying to get the commercial airline business.	1
ClaimBuster	21825				But, when I had quoted a Democratic President, as the President says, I was a Democrat.	1
ClaimBuster	21826				And until we do, Americans here at home are not going to be safe.	0
ClaimBuster	21827				I can think of many.	0
ClaimBuster	21828				Actually, we've increased funding for dealing with nuclear proliferation about 35 percent since I've been the president.	1
ClaimBuster	21829				But I'm not going to telegraph my punches, which is what Senator Obama did.	1
ClaimBuster	21830				"People say, ""I don't care."	0
ClaimBuster	21831				First of all, the report to which Senator Kennedy refers is one that was made many, many months ago and related particularly to the uh - period immediately after Sputnik.	1
ClaimBuster	21832				And I might say that two-thirds of the Republicans in the House voted against a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage and a majority of the Democrats sustained it - nearly two-thirds of them voted for the dollar twenty-five.	1
ClaimBuster	21833				Nobody has that except a president who has served a long time or a secretary of state.	1
ClaimBuster	21834				As a matter of fact, the year before I went out of office we gave a $50 million refund to the property taxpayers of Georgia.	1
ClaimBuster	21835				Because this ever-rising arms race madness makes both nations less secure.	0
ClaimBuster	21836				It may later be Catholics; it may be - later be Baptists who are threatened by some foreign country.	0
ClaimBuster	21837				There are many of the points that he has made that I would like to comment upon.	0
ClaimBuster	21838				If you don't have health insurance, you're going to be able to buy the same kind of insurance that Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees.	1
ClaimBuster	21839				Well, you're right about Islamophobia, and that's a shame.	0
ClaimBuster	21840				It is 300,000 people smaller today than it was eight years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	21841				And I don't want to give my friend Ross another shot at me here but I am fighting with the Congress to get this through.	0
ClaimBuster	21842				And of course he's going to raise your taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	21843				And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years.	1
ClaimBuster	21844				But let me just tell you.	0
ClaimBuster	21845				And I've done what no candidate for President has ever done, I told you before the election what I'd do.	1
ClaimBuster	21846				"They said, ""Well, these are the people that have the qualifications."""	0
ClaimBuster	21847				Now, we've made it clear, along with our allies, that when Milosevic leaves, then Serbia will be able to have a more normal relationship with the rest of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	21848				First of all on the issue of partial birth or so-called late-term abortion, I would sign a law banning that procedure, provided that doctors have the ability to save a woman's life or to act if her health is severely at risk.	0
ClaimBuster	21849				I'm going to lead the world in the greatest counterproliferation effort.	0
ClaimBuster	21850				That's the argument between Mr. Nixon and myself and on that issue the American people have to make their judgment and I think it's a important judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	21851				Now, that -- put you in jail in corporate America if you kept books that way but in government it's just kind of the way things are.	0
ClaimBuster	21852				And while I'm all for the McKinney bill, that, by itself, simply won't do.	0
ClaimBuster	21853				I think sometimes Mr. Mondale's running away from his.	0
ClaimBuster	21854				That is the number-one threat we face in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	21855				The NAFTA agreement is defective.	0
ClaimBuster	21856				For the last ten years the budget of the United States has grown from uh - about 11 percent per year.	1
ClaimBuster	21857				The reorganization proposal that I have put forward is one uh first step.	1
ClaimBuster	21858				Together we can get anything done.	0
ClaimBuster	21859				He insulted a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, called her an eating machine.	1
ClaimBuster	21860				This is what it's all about.	0
ClaimBuster	21861				There are plenty of people standing in line to become a citizen.	1
ClaimBuster	21862				So, if we're at a point in history where we want to stop talking about it and do it, I've got a lot of experience in figuring out how to solve problems, making the solutions work, and then moving on to the next one.	0
ClaimBuster	21863				They lost plenty of money on that one.	1
ClaimBuster	21864				This has a great effect on the s- underdeveloped world, which faces problems of low income and high population density and inadequate resources.	1
ClaimBuster	21865				First of all, by the way, I'd eliminate ethanol subsidies.	0
ClaimBuster	21866				It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	21867				But what we haven't yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	21868				Since this campaign began I have had a very rare privilege.	0
ClaimBuster	21869				But apparently his position hasn't changed.	0
ClaimBuster	21870				They must not develop nuclear capability.	0
ClaimBuster	21871				I believe in tax equity for the middle-income taxpayer, increasing the personal exemption.	0
ClaimBuster	21872				This is one instance where I agree with - with the Republican platform.	0
ClaimBuster	21873				I know I can do a better job in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	21874				The Wall Street Journal said 96 percent of small businesses are not affected at all by my plan.	1
ClaimBuster	21875				And Senator Obama says he's for nuclear, but he's against reprocessing and he's against storing.	1
ClaimBuster	21876				Of course, I listen to our generals.	0
ClaimBuster	21877				We have to do a better job in human intelligence.	0
ClaimBuster	21878				But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund...	0
ClaimBuster	21879				We didn't have two and a half million, or three million homeless people living on streets and in doorways in this country ten years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	21880				My plan has five basic parts.	0
ClaimBuster	21881				The second biggest surplus next to Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	21882				In a country as wealthy as ours, for us to have people who are going bankrupt because they can't pay their medical bills -- for my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies because they're saying that this may be a pre-existing condition and they don't have to pay her treatment, there's something fundamentally wrong about that.	1
ClaimBuster	21883				But I think Governor Romney maybe hasn't spent enough time looking at how our military works.	0
ClaimBuster	21884				Whether it's organized labor or whether it's the Hollywood elite or whether some of the media elite or whether it's the labor unions or whatever.	0
ClaimBuster	21885				I believe that the world is changing fast.	0
ClaimBuster	21886				What service are you in?	0
ClaimBuster	21887				I believe the best way to help our small businesses is not only through small-business loans, which we have increased since I've been the president of the United States, but to unbundle government contracts so people have a chance to be able to bid and receive a contract to help get their business going.	1
ClaimBuster	21888				What really matters is what happens to your future and what happens to our country as we stand on the brink of a new century, a time of extraordinary possibility.	0
ClaimBuster	21889				It's got to be fair.	0
ClaimBuster	21890				They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs - a few large companies in many cases - and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place.	0
ClaimBuster	21891				It's precisely what Kim Jong Il wants.	0
ClaimBuster	21892				Now, with respect to DOMA and the marriage laws, the states have always been able to manage those laws.	1
ClaimBuster	21893				We're getting rid of carried interest provisions.	1
ClaimBuster	21894				I'll be against it when I'm president.	0
ClaimBuster	21895				Yes, that's a great question.	0
ClaimBuster	21896				And you know what, the issue is changing.	0
ClaimBuster	21897				It would depend entirely on what they asked us to do, but the real secret there is for them to abide by the agreements they've made and find a way to trust each other, and they're going to have to spend some time and trust each other.	0
ClaimBuster	21898				We've got ten and a half million more jobs, the deficit's been reduced by 60 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	21899				I feel strongly about education.	0
ClaimBuster	21900				I couldn't agree more that the Iraqis want to be free and that they could be free.	0
ClaimBuster	21901				By the time the century turns, we have got to have our deficit under control, we have to work out of so that surplus is building up so when the baby boomers like me retire, we're okay.	0
ClaimBuster	21902				It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives.	1
ClaimBuster	21903				He was right, but then he put in place deficits twice that size for every one of his four years.	1
ClaimBuster	21904				Why shouldn't you get what you want, as opposed to what some lobbyist cuts a deal, writes a little piece in the law and he goes through.	0
ClaimBuster	21905				I doubt that I acknowledged that this year.	0
ClaimBuster	21906				Americans shouldn't have gone there in the first place, had we let them defend themselves, as they have a right to do under Article 57 of the United Nations charter.	1
ClaimBuster	21907				America needs a new direction.	0
ClaimBuster	21908				I think one of the problems we have, particularly for seniors, is there is no prescription drug coverage in Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	21909				He points to the fact that I visited Cuba while Mr. Batista was in power there.	1
ClaimBuster	21910				We're at a fork in the road.	0
ClaimBuster	21911				Let me just quickly say, at the current pace, the president will not secure the loose material in the Soviet Union -- former Soviet Union for 13 years.	0
ClaimBuster	21912				If you itemize your tax return, you get no marriage penalty relief.	1
ClaimBuster	21913				Well, I hope this is the first and last time I have to say this.	0
ClaimBuster	21914				But I think it's worth it, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	21915				So the General Motors experience is relevant.	0
ClaimBuster	21916				We've got young people who have got the grades and the will and the drive to go to college, but they just don't have the money.	0
ClaimBuster	21917				Our diversity is a strength.	0
ClaimBuster	21918				Well, you know, I admire so much Senator Obama's eloquence.	0
ClaimBuster	21919				He caused the death of so many people.	1
ClaimBuster	21920				Senator Obama has never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue.	1
ClaimBuster	21921				It's a time to draw ourselves together: to have a president and a Congress that can work together with mutual respect for a change, cooperating for a change, in the open for a change, so the people can understand their own government.	0
ClaimBuster	21922				But it's in your hands.	0
ClaimBuster	21923				"And they all say, ""Well, it was a long time ago."""	0
ClaimBuster	21924				And I'll tell you exactly why.	0
ClaimBuster	21925				When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful.	1
ClaimBuster	21926				At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides.	0
ClaimBuster	21927				And I would make sure that the uh - Saudis understood this ahead of time so there would be no doubt in their mind.	0
ClaimBuster	21928				We have much more manpower and much more equipment there.	1
ClaimBuster	21929				And as a result, these mainly Hispanic youngsters are some of the best learners in Houston, Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	21930				His whole body was shaking from the nerve disease, the muscular disease that he had.	1
ClaimBuster	21931				I am for the North American Free Trade Agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	21932				That's where he was when he came into office.	1
ClaimBuster	21933				And we can't do it unless we do have adequate funds for, for example, information which has been cut by the Congress, adequate funds for technical assistance.	0
ClaimBuster	21934				We know where you're cutting right now.	0
ClaimBuster	21935				How much did you cut them by?	0
ClaimBuster	21936				Now on the question of gold.	0
ClaimBuster	21937				The President shouldn't have vetoed that bill.	0
ClaimBuster	21938				The force must be strong enough so that the mission can be accomplished.	0
ClaimBuster	21939				Well, I think the answer uh - as to the kind of person that I would select uh - is obvious.	0
ClaimBuster	21940				But between us, we can either destroy the world or we can save it.	0
ClaimBuster	21941				I have disagreed with leaders of my own party.	1
ClaimBuster	21942				Well, if you've got a kid that's extravagant, you can lecture him all you want to about his extravagance.	0
ClaimBuster	21943				You shouldn't be worrying if you get a new job as to whether that's gonna -- and part of our plan is to make it what they call portable -- big word, but that means if you're working for the Jones Company and you go to the Smith Company, your insurance goes with you.	0
ClaimBuster	21944				You know, after we killed bin Laden I was at ground zero for a memorial and talked to a young women who was four years old when 9/11 happened.	1
ClaimBuster	21945				We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.	0
ClaimBuster	21946				I would uh - also like to point out that we, in this country, have let our economy go down the drain.	0
ClaimBuster	21947				We set a very high standard for ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	21948				And I cannot let that stand, because it isn't true.	0
ClaimBuster	21949				And, frankly, you should have changed the laws.	0
ClaimBuster	21950				Now, on the Middle East, as you know, I worked very hard for peace in the Middle East.	1
ClaimBuster	21951				I would have fought to make certain our troops had everybody possible to help them win the mission.	0
ClaimBuster	21952				And in addition, the tax program of the Ford administration, which provides an incentive for industry to move into our major uh - metropolitan areas, into the inner cities, will bring jobs where people are, and help to revitalize those cities as they can be.	1
ClaimBuster	21953				We spoke a multitude of tongues.	1
ClaimBuster	21954				Well, Tom, we're going to have to take on entitlements and I think we've got to do it quickly.	0
ClaimBuster	21955				I was very disappointed in the fact that the uh - GAO released that report because I think it interjected political partisan politics at the present time.	0
ClaimBuster	21956				If in the next 5 minutes a television announcer came on and said, there is a major international crisis -- there is a major threat to the world or in this country a major threat -- my question is, who, if you were appointed to name 1 of the 3 of us, who would you choose?	0
ClaimBuster	21957				And they will make those sacrifices.	0
ClaimBuster	21958				And it makes a difference in terms of how well and effectively women are able to work.	0
ClaimBuster	21959				I think in education, when he lectured the country about the importance of discipline, I didn't like it at first, but I think it helped a little bit.	0
ClaimBuster	21960				I will fight for oil, coal and natural gas.	0
ClaimBuster	21961				Well, let me say I do think that parties are important in that they tell something about the program and something about the man.	0
ClaimBuster	21962				And I left the party eventually, because I could no longer follow the turn in the Democratic leadership that took us down an entirely different path, a path of centralizing authority in the Federal Government, lacking trust in the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	21963				Small businesses begin to grow, and jobs are added.	0
ClaimBuster	21964				And I'm glad that Governor Romney agrees with the steps that we're taking.	1
ClaimBuster	21965				And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth.	0
ClaimBuster	21966				"In our particular church, we did not use that term, ""born again,'' so I don't know whether I would fit that -- that particular term."	1
ClaimBuster	21967				We were losing 800,000 jobs a month when I started.	1
ClaimBuster	21968				Number three, we do have to make sure that we're protecting religious minorities and women because these countries can't develop unless all the population, not just half of it, is developing.	0
ClaimBuster	21969				Number three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	21970				I just figure, as lucky as I've been, I owe it to them and I owe it to the future generations and on a very personal basis, I owe it to my children and grandchildren.	0
ClaimBuster	21971				If I thought that there was no alternative, then I might feel differently.	0
ClaimBuster	21972				"Let me -- I'm not exactly sure what you mean, ""passes the global test,"" you take preemptive action if you pass a global test."	0
ClaimBuster	21973				We have to be tough on the Soviet Union, but I think the American people -- --	0
ClaimBuster	21974				And the answer is, yes, we can help, but it's going to take a different path.	0
ClaimBuster	21975				And you say: Well, how are you going to pay for it?	0
ClaimBuster	21976				That old adage they use--we're going to soak the rich- -we're going to soak the rich--it always ends up being the poor cab driver or the working man that ends up paying the bill.	0
ClaimBuster	21977				That's an incredibly powerful nuclear deterrent.	0
ClaimBuster	21978				It means that we are helping state and local governments set up road projects and bridge projects that keep people in their jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	21979				And so, today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the cost: $200 billion -- $200 billion that could have been used for health care, for schools, for construction, for prescription drugs for seniors, and it's in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	21980				We have never been asked to send troops to the West Bank.	1
ClaimBuster	21981				We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz.	1
ClaimBuster	21982				The United Nations, Kofi Annan offered help after Baghdad fell.	1
ClaimBuster	21983				If I could wish for one thing for great public schools, it would be a strong family unit in every home -- nothing will ever replace that.	0
ClaimBuster	21984				And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.	0
ClaimBuster	21985				And one of the things I think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in America.	0
ClaimBuster	21986				I'd rather, if you gave me 2 bad choices --	0
ClaimBuster	21987				We're going to have to-the MX.	0
ClaimBuster	21988				There has been a restoration of faith and confidence and trust in the presidency because I've been open, candid and forthright.	0
ClaimBuster	21989				We don't have good health care.	0
ClaimBuster	21990				You will know their names.	0
ClaimBuster	21991				I supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts; John McCain opposed it.	1
ClaimBuster	21992				I was just at a coal facility, where some 1,200 people lost their jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	21993				It must be in the national interests, must be in our vital interests whether we ever send troops.	0
ClaimBuster	21994				I've talked to bankers and builders and developers, the housing advocates, community development agencies, and they want leadership from Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	21995				We've been battling over abortion for a long period of time.	1
ClaimBuster	21996				And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated.	1
ClaimBuster	21997				We must associate ourselves with their aspirations.	0
ClaimBuster	21998				We're the best producers in the world, and I want -- I want the farmers feeding the world.	0
ClaimBuster	21999				That's what America is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	22000				There are no guarantees that uh - if you take uh - one road or another that you will be a successful president.	0
ClaimBuster	22001				Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience.	0
ClaimBuster	22002				What I want to emphasize, though, is that I have been a strong proponent of pay-as- you-go.	1
ClaimBuster	22003				They've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	22004				America is a fair society, and it is not right that Vice President Bush pays less in taxes than the janitor who helps him.	1
ClaimBuster	22005				Then I believe that we should move full time on our missile production, particularly on Minuteman and on Polaris.	0
ClaimBuster	22006				Well, think about what the governor -- think about what the governor just said.	0
ClaimBuster	22007				I'm a pretty independent thinker.	0
ClaimBuster	22008				We'll have what economists call middle-out growth.	0
ClaimBuster	22009				There will be no more debates.	1
ClaimBuster	22010				Now in the special session of Congress and also in the session that preceded it, the Democratic Congress - in which there's a two-to-one Democratic majority - was asked by the President to give us the funds and give us the power to do a job and they did nothing at all, And in the special session in which Senator Kennedy was calling the signals, along with Senator Johnson, they turned it down and he himself voted against giving us the powers despite the fact that the bill had already been considered before, that it already had hearings on, and the Congress already knew what it had before it.	1
ClaimBuster	22011				Well, just for the record, when I was governor we had the lowest -- second lowest tax burden of any state in the country, the highest job growth rate of any state when I ran for president and were widely recognized for a lot of other advances.	1
ClaimBuster	22012				That's why my proposal protects everybody from $25,000 a year or less against any tax increases, and treats those $70,000 and under in a way that is more beneficial than the way the President proposes with a sales tax or a flat tax.	0
ClaimBuster	22013				I did not advocate reducing the federal debt because I don't believe that you're going to be able to reduce the federal debt very much in nineteen sixty-one, two, or three.	1
ClaimBuster	22014				I've said that years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	22015				It seems to me that if we're going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close.	0
ClaimBuster	22016				That's why we have to emphasize manufacturing.	0
ClaimBuster	22017				I've watched year in and year out as companies have shut down and people have lost their jobs because China has not played by the same rules, in part by holding down artificially the value of their currency.	1
ClaimBuster	22018				I'm for that proposed law, the governor is against it.	1
ClaimBuster	22019				That's what I thought we ought to do.	0
ClaimBuster	22020				We didn't think that was right.	0
ClaimBuster	22021				And I'm not going to stand for somebody saying that because someone yelled something at a rally -- there's a lot of things that have been yelled at your rallies, Senator Obama, that I'm not happy about either.	0
ClaimBuster	22022				The islands which Mr. Nixon is discussing are five or four miles, respectively, off the coast of China.	1
ClaimBuster	22023				How about a spending freeze on everything but defense, veteran affairs and entitlement programs.	0
ClaimBuster	22024				When uh - the Nixon-Ford Administration started, this was 10 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	22025				But I don't believe this president can.	0
ClaimBuster	22026				I think a lot of people deserve credit and I've tried to give it to them.	0
ClaimBuster	22027				This is not the end of the process; this is the beginning of the process.	0
ClaimBuster	22028				But I'm not in favor of rounding up people and -- and -- and taking them out of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	22029				Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years.	1
ClaimBuster	22030				Number two, let's help families right away by providing them a tax cut -- a middle-class tax cut for people making less than $200,000, and let's allow them to access their IRA accounts without penalty if they're experiencing a crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	22031				But the fact of it is, every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit has been off by billions and billions of dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	22032				But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City.	1
ClaimBuster	22033				I hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president.	0
ClaimBuster	22034				So the appropriate thing strategically to do was to reduce his ability to threaten his neighbors.	0
ClaimBuster	22035				I happen to -- I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit.	0
ClaimBuster	22036				The federal government has cut Medicare and Medicaid in the last few years, states have cut Medicaid -- we've done it in Arkansas under budget pressures.	1
ClaimBuster	22037				In the last debate, my opponent said those lawsuits only caused the cost to go up by 1 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	22038				I don't think you can -- I don't think you can get results that way.	0
ClaimBuster	22039				He jumped on it a year after it had been introduced and it never got passed.	1
ClaimBuster	22040				One of the things we've done is we've taken the -- we're beginning to transform our military.	1
ClaimBuster	22041				And finally, moving generic drugs to the market quicker.	0
ClaimBuster	22042				And we hope that we'll be serving you in the White House in January of 1989.	0
ClaimBuster	22043				I've got to make this point, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	22044				Fourth, let me say that in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the great force on our side is the desire of people to be free.	0
ClaimBuster	22045				So my belief is that, (A), we have to enforce the laws we've already got, make sure that we're keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, those who are mentally ill. We've done a much better job in terms of background checks, but we've got more to do when it comes to enforcement.	0
ClaimBuster	22046				And I think when you make a mistake, you say I made a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	22047				Teddy Roosevelt used to talk about the arena, you know, daring to fail greatly or succeed, no matter.	1
ClaimBuster	22048				I see my friend Senator Mitchell.	0
ClaimBuster	22049				Instead, it's gone up by that amount.	1
ClaimBuster	22050				And what I have proposed is something much better.	0
ClaimBuster	22051				But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate.	1
ClaimBuster	22052				Now our challenge is to take these things, do something with them.	0
ClaimBuster	22053				The budget that we are talking about is not reducing our military spending.	1
ClaimBuster	22054				And it's a big problem.	0
ClaimBuster	22055				And I'd say to the Reform party, take a look at the Republican party.	0
ClaimBuster	22056				We've got a very good record appointing women to high positions and positions of trust, and I'm not defensive at all about it.	1
ClaimBuster	22057				And guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap?	0
ClaimBuster	22058				What's wrong with limiting the terms of members of Congress to 12?	0
ClaimBuster	22059				Let me first give you a sports update.	0
ClaimBuster	22060				And we're going to be fiscally responsible.	0
ClaimBuster	22061				You have to make tough calls.	0
ClaimBuster	22062				And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession.	0
ClaimBuster	22063				And I can assure you that this administration will follow that high moral principle in our future efforts in foreign policy, including our efforts in the Middle East where it is vitally important because the Middle East is the crossroads of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	22064				We've got four million young people volunteering every year, the number hasn't gone down.	1
ClaimBuster	22065				And if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know we're going in, and all of the people that we really wanted -- the leaders -- they're all gone.	0
ClaimBuster	22066				So the point is, I want people to have tax cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	22067				But you have to have a little bit of experience to know where to start.	0
ClaimBuster	22068				One being Russia, where we had IMF loans that ended up in the pockets of a lot of powerful people and didn't help the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	22069				The middle-class need a rescue package.	0
ClaimBuster	22070				But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company.	1
ClaimBuster	22071				And I look forward to having that opportunity.	0
ClaimBuster	22072				Secretary, you have no plan.	0
ClaimBuster	22073				Their budget weakened our support for education.	0
ClaimBuster	22074				You can't wish it away.	0
ClaimBuster	22075				And I have to defend the honor of my state.	0
ClaimBuster	22076				And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO.	1
ClaimBuster	22077				And so, I don't think the Patriot Act abridges your rights at all.	0
ClaimBuster	22078				And then in 1982, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	22079				It's happening in other states that we visit, too.	1
ClaimBuster	22080				I agree that too many incumbent politicians in Washington in both parties have consistently opposed campaign finance reform.	0
ClaimBuster	22081				But I said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe, come and get one for free.	1
ClaimBuster	22082				Our objectives ought to be to strengthen the democracies, to stop Communist and other extremist influences, and stabilize the community in that area.	0
ClaimBuster	22083				And finally, he said he's going to have a novel health care plan.	0
ClaimBuster	22084				You rely on good military people to execute the military component of the strategy, but winning the peace is larger than just the military component.	0
ClaimBuster	22085				It would have charged seniors more for out-of-pocket costs as well as more in premiums because doctors could have charged them more.	1
ClaimBuster	22086				So I think we have to change the nature of politics.	0
ClaimBuster	22087				I care about 100 percent of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	22088				Why am I lowering taxes on the middle-class?	0
ClaimBuster	22089				So Medicare, it's going to be a little tougher.	0
ClaimBuster	22090				We can't have any more instances like what happened when Mr. Bush went to Japan and the Japanese prime minister said he felt sympathy for our country.	1
ClaimBuster	22091				And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.	0
ClaimBuster	22092				And I'll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back.	0
ClaimBuster	22093				And I made it plain to them, we're not.	0
ClaimBuster	22094				So I don't believe that we need to do what you've suggested here.	0
ClaimBuster	22095				I'm going to get the training done for our troops.	0
ClaimBuster	22096				She won't even mention the words, and neither will President Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	22097				I think that measures like these are important.	0
ClaimBuster	22098				And, frankly, Senator McCain voted for four out of five of President Bush's budgets.	1
ClaimBuster	22099				But I want to be a president of the United States who makes sure that we never again do business with a drug-running Panamanian dictator, that we never again funnel aid to the contras through convicted drug dealers.	0
ClaimBuster	22100				I saw a study that came out today that said you're going to raise taxes by $3,000 to $4,000 on middle-income families.	1
ClaimBuster	22101				I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders -- and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones -- made a difference.	1
ClaimBuster	22102				The big struggle will be to prevent the influence of Castro spreading to other countries - Mexico, Panama, Bolivia, Colombia.	0
ClaimBuster	22103				What I was saying is, we're not going to round up 12 million people, undocumented illegals, and take them out of the nation.	0
ClaimBuster	22104				We didn't listen to the nuclear freeze crowd.	0
ClaimBuster	22105				And I hope it's as soon as possible.	0
ClaimBuster	22106				That's not going to happen, so long as I'm your president.	0
ClaimBuster	22107				And now we have a major question facing the American people as to whether we'll deal with this deficit and get it down for the sake of a healthy recovery.	0
ClaimBuster	22108				Mr. Perot wants to do the same thing.	1
ClaimBuster	22109				It was clear-cut votes that Senator Obama voted, I think, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream America.	0
ClaimBuster	22110				"But we're not going to simply kill some people to say, ""Oh, look, we got even.''"	0
ClaimBuster	22111				Fourth graders and eighth graders are tested in English and math.	1
ClaimBuster	22112				Because you left out one other exception, the health of the mother.	0
ClaimBuster	22113				And we all know the state of the Washington, D.C., school system.	0
ClaimBuster	22114				Senator Kennedy has a responsibility to criticize those things that are wrong, but he has also a responsibility to be right in his criticism.	0
ClaimBuster	22115				It had a very, very big impact.	0
ClaimBuster	22116				But as we look at the quality-of-life programs - jobs, health, education, crime, recreation - we feel that as we move forward with a healthier economy, we can absorb the small necessary cost that will be required.	0
ClaimBuster	22117				Now Senator McCain and President Bush had a very different judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	22118				I was in North Pittsburgh - I think it was a few weeks ago, on my campaign - the water mains in that city had begun to leak, and literally, there wasn't money available to fix them.	1
ClaimBuster	22119				But I do think we are right when we try to, for example, give mothers and newborns 48 hours before they can be kicked out of the hospital, ending these drive-by deliveries.	0
ClaimBuster	22120				Now, Social Security, let's lay it to rest once and for all.	0
ClaimBuster	22121				...will be there for you.	0
ClaimBuster	22122				While I was Governor, more than eight years ago, I found 14 separate instances where women were discriminated against in the body of California law, and I had passed and signed into law 14 statutes that eliminated those discriminations, including the economic ones that you have just mentioned - equal pay and so forth.	1
ClaimBuster	22123				So, in some ways, we've got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for Americans and I believe that the economy works best when middle-class families are getting tax breaks so that they've got some money in their pockets, and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in, that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure we're not blowing up the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	22124				We are for programs, in addition, which will see that our medical care for the aged are - is - are much - is much better handled than it is at the present time.	0
ClaimBuster	22125				And that didn't make any sense.	0
ClaimBuster	22126				Well, first of all, I want to underscore the same point the president mad,e which is that if I'm President of the United States, when I'm President of the United States, we will stand with Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	22127				When I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women's rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	22128				For one basic reason, so that students can get more one-on-one time with teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	22129				And that's what I do.	0
ClaimBuster	22130				As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said.	0
ClaimBuster	22131				There was a story today or yesterday in the Washington Post about my economic programs and my chief budget officer and my chief economic officer were both African Americans, even though the Post didn't mention that, which I think is a sign of progress.	1
ClaimBuster	22132				And a year later, 9/11 happened.	1
ClaimBuster	22133				Let me tell you about one of the governor's.	0
ClaimBuster	22134				To negotiate with the Soviet Union a balanced, controlled, observable, and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry, there is a disturbing pattern in the attitude of Governor Reagan.	0
ClaimBuster	22135				Line item veto -- there's a good reform program for you.	0
ClaimBuster	22136				When I was a young man, my father was a senator opposed to the Vietnam War.	1
ClaimBuster	22137				If you're going to increase domestic oil and gas production - and we have to - you have to give those producers an opportunity to uh - develop their land or their wells.	0
ClaimBuster	22138				Now, it may not work.	0
ClaimBuster	22139				That's why they call the President the Commander in Chief.	1
ClaimBuster	22140				The Vice President did call Social Security a few years ago basically or largely a welfare program.	1
ClaimBuster	22141				So I can't tell you where it's coming from, but I am very much concerned about AIDS and I believe that we've got the best researchers in the world out there at NIH working the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	22142				She's raising the money from the people she wants to control.	1
ClaimBuster	22143				Can we -- can we stay on Medicare?	0
ClaimBuster	22144				The administration did not deal with it.	1
ClaimBuster	22145				You know, I support a national patient's bill of rights, Mr. Vice President, and I want all people covered.	1
ClaimBuster	22146				I'm ready to provide that leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	22147				Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there.	0
ClaimBuster	22148				That happened when I was president.	1
ClaimBuster	22149				It is also essential for us to understand what our mission is in Iran, and that is to dissuade Iran from having a nuclear weapon through peaceful and diplomatic means.	1
ClaimBuster	22150				And I'm glad that we have a good director in George Bush.	0
ClaimBuster	22151				The biggest crime increase in history, the biggest drug increase in history in Arkansas.	1
ClaimBuster	22152				And they'll have to undergo the same scrutiny that all projects should in competition with others.	0
ClaimBuster	22153				Donald Trump is a small business.	0
ClaimBuster	22154				Congress -- they're all good people.	0
ClaimBuster	22155				The only bright spot is that over 300,000 jobs have been created by small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	22156				George Bush embraced comprehensive immigration reform.	1
ClaimBuster	22157				One percent of America got more than the 80 percent of America that earned from $100,000 down.	1
ClaimBuster	22158				And that was the line.	0
ClaimBuster	22159				It's energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business.	0
ClaimBuster	22160				But I want to touch on this is tobacco thing.	0
ClaimBuster	22161				We can move forward, and clean up our climate, and develop green technologies, and alternate -- alternative energies for -- for hybrid, for hydrogen, for battery-powered cars, so that we can clean up our environment and at the same time get our economy going by creating millions of jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	22162				We didn't make a judgment in fifty-seven and fifty-six and fifty-five and fifty-four that outer space would be important.	1
ClaimBuster	22163				that is a very good reason for voting for Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen on the 8th of November.	0
ClaimBuster	22164				It's kind of Washington, D.C. focus.	0
ClaimBuster	22165				Number one, let's focus on jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	22166				It certainly looks that way.	0
ClaimBuster	22167				We're selling American automobiles in Japan now.	1
ClaimBuster	22168				My colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, will tell you that Bob Dole kept his word.	0
ClaimBuster	22169				The Joint Chiefs urged the President not to put our troops in that barracks because they were indefensible.	1
ClaimBuster	22170				Abraham Lincoln came to the presidency in 1860 after a rather little known uh - session in the House of Representatives and after being defeated for the Senate in fifty-eight and was a distinguished president.	1
ClaimBuster	22171				I can think of doctors and scientists, Jonas Salk who for example discovered a vaccine which cured one of the most dread diseases we ever had.	1
ClaimBuster	22172				And so yes, everybody's taxed too much and I want to get the taxes down, but not by signing a tax bill that's gonna raise taxes on people.	0
ClaimBuster	22173				"And I -- and I went to my staff, and I said, ""How come all the people for these jobs are -- are all men."""	1
ClaimBuster	22174				It's an issue of principle, not politics.	0
ClaimBuster	22175				Why don't I want to raise taxes on people?	0
ClaimBuster	22176				And that means doing it under the Medicare program.	0
ClaimBuster	22177				Here is the role of the federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	22178				And number three, I will not under any circumstances raise taxes on middle-income families.	0
ClaimBuster	22179				But I think it's important that we have a position, that we take it, and we state it to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	22180				I don't expect you to watch every vote.	0
ClaimBuster	22181				If they're safe, they're coming.	0
ClaimBuster	22182				I've been the governor of a big state.	1
ClaimBuster	22183				I think we can save lives.	0
ClaimBuster	22184				I'm running to get some things done for America.	0
ClaimBuster	22185				So I modified it, the largest tax increase in the history of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	22186				So part of the job of the next commander-in-chief, in keeping all of you safe, is making sure that we can see some of the 21st Century challenges and anticipate them before they happen.	0
ClaimBuster	22187				Well, Katherine, that's a great question.	0
ClaimBuster	22188				And kids across this country are going to recognize, we're bringing back an economy.	0
ClaimBuster	22189				President Obama has moved millions of people out.	1
ClaimBuster	22190				If you think the Republican party is some place for you to come if you're narrow minded or bigoted or don't like certain people in America, the exits are clearly marked for you to walk out of as I stand here without compromise, because this is the party of Lincoln.	0
ClaimBuster	22191				But -- but I can say this, that we're talking about the Middle East and how to help the Middle East reject the kind of terrorism we're seeing, and the rising tide of tumult and -- and confusion.	0
ClaimBuster	22192				If the president were reelected, we'd go to almost $20 trillion of national debt.	1
ClaimBuster	22193				That's a pocketbook issue for women and families all across the country.	0
ClaimBuster	22194				And as a consequence, we've seen millions of young people be able to afford college, and that's going to make sure that young women are going to be able to compete in that marketplace.	1
ClaimBuster	22195				And at the same time a willingness to move forward steadily, thoughtfully cautiously.	0
ClaimBuster	22196				Seventy-five percent of known Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justice.	1
ClaimBuster	22197				I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of Americans, 95 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	22198				I think we ought to have federal liability protection, depending upon whether or not standards have been met.	0
ClaimBuster	22199				I do understand creating jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	22200				Somebody somewhere has to take responsibility for this.	0
ClaimBuster	22201				Saddam Hussein released a tape, as you know, claiming it was a transcript of their meeting, where she said we will not become involved in your border dispute and, in effect, you can take the northern part of the country.	1
ClaimBuster	22202				If you entrust me with the presidency, I will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure our forces stay the strongest in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	22203				We are the strongest and most powerful free society on Earth.	0
ClaimBuster	22204				I don't think so, Candy.	0
ClaimBuster	22205				I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.	0
ClaimBuster	22206				We ended the Korean War; by strong, firm leadership we have kept out of other wars; and we have avoided surrender of principle or territory at the conference table.	1
ClaimBuster	22207				And they both looked at me and said: We need you.	1
ClaimBuster	22208				We have a deficit because this country went into a recession.	1
ClaimBuster	22209				I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise.	0
ClaimBuster	22210				The question is values; the question is strength, the question is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be provided.	0
ClaimBuster	22211				There is no doubt that we have seen in recent years - in recent months - additional acts of violence against Jews in France and, of course, against those who live in Israel, by the PLO and other terrorist organizations.	1
ClaimBuster	22212				Programs that we need, we should make them work better.	0
ClaimBuster	22213				If you're a small business person and you don't insure your employees, Senator Obama will fine you.	1
ClaimBuster	22214				Nobody talked about attacking Pakistan.	1
ClaimBuster	22215				We need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital, particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control.	0
ClaimBuster	22216				What we need to do is raise the minimum wage.	0
ClaimBuster	22217				It means that there will be increased hires.	0
ClaimBuster	22218				And it's a matter of fact that Senator Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history.	1
ClaimBuster	22219				They do some great things.	0
ClaimBuster	22220				I think that says a great deal to the American people about the standards we'll set and the quality of the people that we will pick to serve in our Administration.	0
ClaimBuster	22221				And there's been no concerted effort given to the needs of those who are both poor and black, or poor and who speak a foreign language.	0
ClaimBuster	22222				But I disagree that we don't know the cause of global warming.	0
ClaimBuster	22223				fiscal restraint, I think is necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	22224				So, yes, some may be better off.	0
ClaimBuster	22225				And as I said: You can run but you can't hide the reality.	0
ClaimBuster	22226				First of all, I think it is well to put in perspective where we really do stand with regard to the Soviet Union in this whole matter of growth.	0
ClaimBuster	22227				He can't come here and tell you that he's created health care for Americans because, what, we've got 5 million Americans who have lost their health care, 96,000 of them right here in Missouri.	1
ClaimBuster	22228				Now, here we have to decide between generalized objectives and reality.	0
ClaimBuster	22229				Now six years ago, I stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so because I said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost, what our exit strategy might be, how it would affect our relationships around the world, and whether our intelligence was sound, but also because we hadn't finished the job in Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	22230				The United States of America, Tom, is the greatest force for good, as I said.	0
ClaimBuster	22231				The most important distinction in this campaign is that I represent real hope for change, a departure from trickle-down economics, a departure from tax and spend economics, to invest in growth.	0
ClaimBuster	22232				I have fought excess spending.	1
ClaimBuster	22233				Well, that is just not accurate.	0
ClaimBuster	22234				It's time for a fresh start.	0
ClaimBuster	22235				Secretary Clinton also fought it.	1
ClaimBuster	22236				But I know putting artificial deadlines won't work.	0
ClaimBuster	22237				Yes, it's very difficult to rebut, because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr. Mondale.	0
ClaimBuster	22238				"And the budget plan that I've put out, according to the ""Los Angeles Times"" again, the way these things are typically measured as a percentage of the GDP, will bring government spending down to the lowest level in 50 years."	1
ClaimBuster	22239				"President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, ""We are great, but we can be greater.''"	1
ClaimBuster	22240				The President has asked for my advice.	1
ClaimBuster	22241				Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn't have the money to afford insurance and didn't have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.	1
ClaimBuster	22242				But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly.	1
ClaimBuster	22243				And I don't think we've got all the facts before we make decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	22244				You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history.	1
ClaimBuster	22245				But I have defined the issues and I am not going to let Governor Dukakis go through this election without explaining some of these very liberal position he's the one a liberal, traditional liberal a progressive liberal Democrat.	0
ClaimBuster	22246				Look, this isn't about Governor Bush, it's not about me.	0
ClaimBuster	22247				Let me give you an example.	0
ClaimBuster	22248				We've got $40 billion going to Bermuda.	1
ClaimBuster	22249				I think it depends how you define it.	0
ClaimBuster	22250				President Clinton opposes voluntary prayer amendment.	1
ClaimBuster	22251				Jim, I hope that we can come back to the subject of education because the governor made an extensive statement on it and I have a very different view than the one he expressed.	0
ClaimBuster	22252				I had to make the decision to destroy more life, so do we continue to destroy life -- I made the decision to balance science and ethics.	0
ClaimBuster	22253				Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy.	1
ClaimBuster	22254				This race is about values, it's about change, it's about giving choices to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	22255				That's why Zarqawi and his people are trying to fight us.	0
ClaimBuster	22256				I remember something my dad told me -- I was 18 years old going to Penn Station to go on into the Navy, and he said write your mother -- which I faithfully did; he said serve your country -- my father was an honor, duty and country man; and he said tell the truth.	1
ClaimBuster	22257				I think people need to be held responsible for the actions they take in life.	0
ClaimBuster	22258				So to add nine million new jobs, to control inflation, and to plan for the future with an energy policy now intact as a foundation is our plan for the years ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	22259				Gosh, I sure hope it's not the administration.	0
ClaimBuster	22260				Why did he fail to even promote legislation that would have provided an answer for those that want to come legally and for those that are here illegally today?	1
ClaimBuster	22261				Because there's not enough vouchers; therefore, we shouldn't do it, even though it's working.	1
ClaimBuster	22262				Mr. Ford uh - actually has fewer people now in the private sector in non-farm jobs than when he took office.	1
ClaimBuster	22263				What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.	0
ClaimBuster	22264				Back in 1983, when I was a brand-new United States congressman, the one -- the person I admired the most and still admire the most, Ronald Reagan, wanted to send Marines into Lebanon.	1
ClaimBuster	22265				African-American incomes went up 33 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	22266				He has more of the same.	0
ClaimBuster	22267				It's the age of his ideas that I question.	0
ClaimBuster	22268				And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn't put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid.	1
ClaimBuster	22269				And I don't think there's anything wrong with an honest person who happens to represent an interest of another country for making his case.	0
ClaimBuster	22270				But in late '89 the president signed a secret policy saying we were going to continue to try to improve relations with him, and we sent him some sort of communication on the eve of his invasion of Kuwait that we still wanted better relations.	1
ClaimBuster	22271				The point that is always left out is the fact that we expressed regrets to Castro this winter; that we expressed regrets - the Eisenhower Administration expressed regrets - for a flight over Southern Russia in 1958.	1
ClaimBuster	22272				In 1979 we ran a $29 billion deficit all year.	1
ClaimBuster	22273				First of all, that's simply not true what he just said, of course.	0
ClaimBuster	22274				And the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate.	1
ClaimBuster	22275				I think almost every other developed nation in the world has an energy policy except us.	1
ClaimBuster	22276				And you want to do something about all this extra spending that concerns Mr. Perot and me?	0
ClaimBuster	22277				When Senator McCain was cheerleading the president to go into Iraq, he suggested it was going to be quick and easy, we'd be greeted as liberators.	1
ClaimBuster	22278				I have fought to reform government.	1
ClaimBuster	22279				Yes, if we don't do something about it, we may find ourselves unilaterally, if I may use that term, dismantling some of these weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	22280				Well, they also know if they live in San Diego, Mr. President, if you're caught with 125 pounds of marijuana or less, you go back to Mexico.	1
ClaimBuster	22281				Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager.	1
ClaimBuster	22282				He surely must be aware that most of the equipment and arms and resources for Castro came from the United States, flowed out of Florida and other parts of the United States to Castro in the mountains.	1
ClaimBuster	22283				Now, in the meantime, the special prosecutor, within the last few days, after an investigation himself, said there was no reason for him to get involved because he found nothing that would justify it.	1
ClaimBuster	22284				Number four, get to us a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	22285				Well, you think it's relevant.	0
ClaimBuster	22286				Now that the President gets millions of dollars from the trial lawyers, he probably doesn't like this provision.	1
ClaimBuster	22287				When Governor Romney was asked whether teachers, hiring more teachers was important to growing our economy, Governor Romney said that doesn't grow our economy.	1
ClaimBuster	22288				Now, the President can say well he wants to mend it, not end it.	0
ClaimBuster	22289				I meet with them all the time.	0
ClaimBuster	22290				I will not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs.	0
ClaimBuster	22291				When I was campaigning in 1976, everywhere I went, the mayors and local officials were in despair about the rapidly deteriorating central cities of our nation.	1
ClaimBuster	22292				But if not, instead of continuing to subsidize failure, the money will go to -- the federal money will go to the parents for public school or charter school or tutorial or Catholic school.	0
ClaimBuster	22293				We have learned that you give him an inch he'll take a mile.	0
ClaimBuster	22294				No longer do we give the image of being on the rise.	0
ClaimBuster	22295				Now, finally, if you can't pay the bills you're dead in the water.	0
ClaimBuster	22296				And this administration, having been in office now for two years or more, has still not taken strong and bold action to stop the proliferation of nuclear waste around the world, particularly plutonium.	1
ClaimBuster	22297				It's hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left.	0
ClaimBuster	22298				I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint -- and I've named 20 of them -- the justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life.	0
ClaimBuster	22299				Even though we've seen some hopeful signs, perhaps, in the flash report on the third quarter, that perhaps the economy is coming out of the recession, we've also seen the rise in the rate of the prime; we have seen mortgage rates back up again, a sure sign of inflation in the housing industry.	1
ClaimBuster	22300				And the kinds of budget proposals that you've put forward, when we don't ask either you or me to pay a dime more in terms of reducing the deficit, but instead we slash support for education, that's undermining our long-term competitiveness.	0
ClaimBuster	22301				Take, for example, Third World debt.	0
ClaimBuster	22302				We then started to build up Afghan forces.	1
ClaimBuster	22303				We're on the side of justice against the forces of slavery, against the forces of injustice.	0
ClaimBuster	22304				Seven point nine percent unemployment is a terrible tragedy in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	22305				We indicated at that time that we were not going to intervene militarily.	1
ClaimBuster	22306				I will concede that in all the areas to which I have referred Senator Kennedy would have the spe- federal government spend more than I would have it spend.	0
ClaimBuster	22307				And still he talks about - uh success.	0
ClaimBuster	22308				But we've got to get through these times, but I have a fundamental belief in the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	22309				We just read on the front pages of America's papers that there are over 100,000 hours of tapes, unlistened to.	1
ClaimBuster	22310				Well, I think the answer to why the drop, I think, has been the economy in the doldrums.	0
ClaimBuster	22311				And I think what we'll plainly do is what we did in 1983 when Senator Dole served, and this is something I think he did a good job on when he served on the Social Security commission and they made some modest changes in Social Security to make sure that it would be alive and well into the 21st century.	1
ClaimBuster	22312				I don't think that's true, but you know, let others fire away on it.	0
ClaimBuster	22313				And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground.	0
ClaimBuster	22314				Also in 1975, we almost brought Israel to their knees after the uh - Yom Kippur War by the so-called reassessment of our relationship to Israel.	1
ClaimBuster	22315				This is uh - an effort that ought to be done primarily by strong leadership in the White House, the inspiration of our people, the tapping of uh - business, agriculture, industry, labor and government at all levels to work on this uh project.	0
ClaimBuster	22316				Six predecessors of mine who served in the Oval Office called for this guarantee of women's rights.	1
ClaimBuster	22317				Tom, can I respond to this briefly?	0
ClaimBuster	22318				I never, ever conceived of such a thing.	0
ClaimBuster	22319				So we've got to enforce our civil rights laws.	0
ClaimBuster	22320				So I think we can easily, within seven, eight, ten years, if we put our minds to it, we can eliminate our dependence on the places in the world that harm our national security if we don't achieve our independence.	0
ClaimBuster	22321				Although I'm not so sure I admire the record.	0
ClaimBuster	22322				I think that what -- I think the point of that is that anybody would have a hard time trying to make a tax cut plan that is so large, that would put us into such big deficits, that gives almost half the benefits to the wealthiest of the wealthy.	1
ClaimBuster	22323				The other point I wanna make is about our defense.	0
ClaimBuster	22324				You know, President Obama said the other day when you're whining before the game is even finished...	1
ClaimBuster	22325				He said he was going to broaden the base.	1
ClaimBuster	22326				I think that we have got to balance the budget every single year, pay down the national debt and, in fact, under my proposal the national debt will be completely eliminated by the year 2012.	0
ClaimBuster	22327				Are we as strong as we must be if we're going to maintain our independence, and if we're going to maintain and hold out the hand of friendship to those who look to us for assistance, to those who look to us for survival?	0
ClaimBuster	22328				We need to have full student loan program for in-state tuition.	0
ClaimBuster	22329				Well, I say they're wrong, because I'm going to create tremendous jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	22330				This is a plan that is going to increase the bureaucracy by 20,000 people.	1
ClaimBuster	22331				Now, why does that matter?	0
ClaimBuster	22332				The only building that was guarded when the troops when into Baghdad was the oil ministry.	1
ClaimBuster	22333				If we have children who are not surrounded with love and affection -- you see, I look at my grandchildren and wonder if they'll ever learn to walk because they're always in someone's arms.	0
ClaimBuster	22334				In the course of that, I think the president's campaign has tried to characterize me as -- as someone who's very different than who I am.	0
ClaimBuster	22335				And as soon as I found it out, he went out the door.	0
ClaimBuster	22336				I know I'm ready for it.	0
ClaimBuster	22337				Just -- would you like to hear...	0
ClaimBuster	22338				Not this one, however, that you bring up.	0
ClaimBuster	22339				I think that would be the greatest use of a defensive weapon.	0
ClaimBuster	22340				First of all, I take full responsibility for what happened in Somalia, but the American people must remember that those soldiers were under an American commander when that happened.	0
ClaimBuster	22341				But Kenny was a great talker.	0
ClaimBuster	22342				I would call to your attention that we were in a war that wound down during those eight years, which of course made a change in military spending because of turning from war to peace.	1
ClaimBuster	22343				And I hope people don't think that I'm questioning his patriotism when I say he used his words to describe his participation in that organization.	0
ClaimBuster	22344				That's a decision that only a woman can make, after consulting her conscience and consulting her religious principles.	0
ClaimBuster	22345				So we need to stay right on top of that and constructively help them move toward democracy and capitalism.	0
ClaimBuster	22346				If you could accept a little criticism, I went all across central Illinois and spoke about agricultural issues, about seven stops.	1
ClaimBuster	22347				That's been missing over the last eight years.	0
ClaimBuster	22348				And finally, championing small business.	0
ClaimBuster	22349				And I was surprised at the extent of it.	1
ClaimBuster	22350				I want to make sure we rebuild our military to keep the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	22351				That's a hatchet, and then I would get out a scalpel, OK?	0
ClaimBuster	22352				Under the president's policies, middle-income Americans have been buried.	0
ClaimBuster	22353				You must be tough and smart.	0
ClaimBuster	22354				Now, that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life.	0
ClaimBuster	22355				And I can tell you looking at you right now, in all cases those answers were affirmative.	0
ClaimBuster	22356				And the question is if you surrender or indicate in advance that you're not going to defend any part of the free world, and you figure that's going to satisfy them, it doesn't satisfy them.	0
ClaimBuster	22357				And I will keep that promise.	0
ClaimBuster	22358				Now, that's not a good way to build support and reduce the risk for our troops and make America safer.	0
ClaimBuster	22359				Well, first, uh - let me set the record straight.	0
ClaimBuster	22360				Well Mr. Nixon has stated the record inaccurately in regard to the depressed area bill.	1
ClaimBuster	22361				But when I started this campaign, I started it very strongly.	0
ClaimBuster	22362				Now, you've shown independence -- commendable independence, on some key issues like torture, for example, and I give you enormous credit for that.	1
ClaimBuster	22363				I stood in the South Bronx on the exact spot that President Carter stood on in 1977.	1
ClaimBuster	22364				I don't think that's a proper way to describe aayuh- chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who has fought for his country for thirty-five years, and I'm sure the governor would agree with me on that.	1
ClaimBuster	22365				In the last several years, the so-called Freedom To Farm Law has, in my view, been mostly a failure.	0
ClaimBuster	22366				Eight countries have left it.	1
ClaimBuster	22367				The record does not show that.	1
ClaimBuster	22368				Now, with respect to religion, you know, as I said, I grew up a Catholic.	1
ClaimBuster	22369				It is obvious that we should have a commitment to them, that Social Security benefits should not be taxed and that there would be no peremptory change in the standards by which Social Security payments are made to retired people.	0
ClaimBuster	22370				But when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we'll also be able to help people that can't get -- don't have money because we are going to have people protected.	0
ClaimBuster	22371				But we came through all of those things and we achieved even new heights and new greatness.	0
ClaimBuster	22372				If I could respond to that.	0
ClaimBuster	22373				And they're going to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	22374				What we can't do is go back to the same policies that got us into such difficulty in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	22375				And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion.	0
ClaimBuster	22376				He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I'd blow them out of the water and start another war.	1
ClaimBuster	22377				And so Dodd-Frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that's not qualified, there are big penalties, except they didn't ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was.	1
ClaimBuster	22378				The federal program doesn't do that.	1
ClaimBuster	22379				It will happen starting next January and maybe it can happen the balance of this year.	0
ClaimBuster	22380				And I don't want to respond in kind to all these things.	0
ClaimBuster	22381				You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have.	0
ClaimBuster	22382				Certainly I'm not proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	22383				I think this debate on Social Security, Medicare, national health insurance typifies, as vividly any other subject tonight, the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and Republican Party.	0
ClaimBuster	22384				Washington, by itself, can't do it all.	0
ClaimBuster	22385				I'm strongly in favor of a federal bill to repeal any gag rules on providers.	0
ClaimBuster	22386				I also understand that an administration is not one person, but an administration is dedicated citizens who are called by the president to serve the country, to serve a cause greater than self, and so I've thought about an administration of people who represent all America, but people who understand my compassionate and conservative philosophy.	0
ClaimBuster	22387				And from the beginning, I did vote to give the authority, because I thought Saddam Hussein was a threat, and I did accept that intelligence.	1
ClaimBuster	22388				Number two, something I would add today is I would tighten those sanctions.	0
ClaimBuster	22389				What we need is action.	0
ClaimBuster	22390				I got to watch the clock here.	0
ClaimBuster	22391				That money, I think, ought to be put into rebuilding the base of our cities.	0
ClaimBuster	22392				And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal.	1
ClaimBuster	22393				Those are the Republican chairman's words.	1
ClaimBuster	22394				And coal, coal production is not up; coal jobs are not up.	1
ClaimBuster	22395				For a return to traditions and values that we once had.	0
ClaimBuster	22396				I think the young people of America are especially interested in how they can serve, and that's one of the reasons why I'm interested in doubling the Peace Corps, making sure that we are creating a volunteer corps all across this country that can be involved in their community, involved in military service, so that military families and our troops are not the only ones bearing the burden of renewing America.	0
ClaimBuster	22397				"Will we do the things that we know must be done and know that one day, down in history 100 years or perhaps before, someone will say, ""Thank God for those people back in the 1980's for preserving our freedom, for saving for us this blessed planet called Earth, with all its grandeur and its beauty.''"	0
ClaimBuster	22398				But I'll also have a better plan of how we're going to deal with Iraq: training the Iraqi forces more rapidly, getting our allies back to the table with a fresh start, with new credibility, with a president whose judgment the rest of the world trusts.	0
ClaimBuster	22399				"That's how we repealed ""don't ask/don't tell."""	0
ClaimBuster	22400				People in the highest office of the land must be responsible for decisions they make in life.	0
ClaimBuster	22401				But most importantly, we have to have the same strategy, which Senator Obama said wouldn't work, couldn't work, still fails to admit that he was wrong about Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	22402				We did that by expanding what's called the no-fly zone by increasing our allies' control of the air space now from the Kuwait border to the suburbs of Baghdad.	1
ClaimBuster	22403				And, so, that's the way I'd reply to it and I believe we can have the strongest and best defense possible if we modernize, if we go forward with competitive strategies and if we do follow through on the Packard Commission report.	0
ClaimBuster	22404				Let me give you some specific examples.	0
ClaimBuster	22405				But the idea of a trillion dollar in cuts through sequestration and budget cuts to the military would change that.	1
ClaimBuster	22406				I don't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, while Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us.	1
ClaimBuster	22407				Mr. Bush talked about taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	22408				We have to remember that the cold war that Mr. Khrushchev is waging and his colleagues are waging, is waged all over the world and it's waged right here in the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	22409				Over the last four years we've made real progress digging our way out of policies that gave us two prolonged wars, record deficits and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	22410				Are we closer to peace?	0
ClaimBuster	22411				We need to be strong, we need to be prepared to use that strength, but we must understand that we are a democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	22412				And we can't allow it to happen anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	22413				What we have right now in Washington is a place that's gridlocked.	0
ClaimBuster	22414				This is a very good step forward for our nation's security, and we'll continue to do as we have done in the past.	0
ClaimBuster	22415				But I can tell you this.	0
ClaimBuster	22416				And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	22417				This is what I have done.	1
ClaimBuster	22418				But you wouldn't change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.	1
ClaimBuster	22419				We're a nation that believes that we're all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled.	0
ClaimBuster	22420				A - More countries voted against us in Asia on this issue than voted with us.	1
ClaimBuster	22421				The fact is our borders are not as secure as they ought to be, and I'll make them secure.	0
ClaimBuster	22422				And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up.	0
ClaimBuster	22423				And I have had a couple of exceptions that I support - rape, incest and the life of the mother.	0
ClaimBuster	22424				"I wouldn't pick a judge who said that the Pledge of Allegiance couldn't be said in a school because it had the words ""under God"" in it."	0
ClaimBuster	22425				We can no longer afford to be second best.	0
ClaimBuster	22426				I don't know what the latest cost estimates are, but it's going to be in the range of 25, 50, 75, $100 billion.	0
ClaimBuster	22427				I've also suggested that on the domestic side there are areas where we can make some cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	22428				And so we were going to make sure that we finished the job.	0
ClaimBuster	22429				I know that doesn't directly talk about Hollywood, but it does reinforce the values you're teaching.	1
ClaimBuster	22430				When I'm president, I'm sending that back to Congress and we're going to get a real prescription drug benefit.	0
ClaimBuster	22431				Now, Senator Obama said, without preconditions.	1
ClaimBuster	22432				But, again, Senator Obama has shifted on a number of occasions.	1
ClaimBuster	22433				It's in my health-care proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	22434				We've given away whole industries.	1
ClaimBuster	22435				The guy that served us lunch gave me a letter today.	1
ClaimBuster	22436				And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.	1
ClaimBuster	22437				So I think it's clear that we're better off than we were four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	22438				When I'm President of the United States, I will keep my word.	0
ClaimBuster	22439				He was against the F - 14 fighter, he was against the M - 1 tank, he was against the B - 1 bomber, he wanted to cut the salary of all of the military, he wanted to bring home half of the American forces in Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	22440				So I'm glad I took on that fight and I believe, with all respect, I was right and he was wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	22441				So, obviously, if we can start increasing home values, then there will be creation of wealth.	0
ClaimBuster	22442				Of the 3 of us, I have balanced a government budget 12 times, I have offered and passed campaign finance reform, offered, pushed for and passed in public referendum lobbyist restrictions, done the kinds of things you have to do to get legislators together not only to establish consensus but to challenge them to change.	1
ClaimBuster	22443				"Now, there are people in this room and people on this stage who've been in meetings when I would sit there and say, ""Is this the one we're going to talk about or do something about?"""	0
ClaimBuster	22444				I guess you'd say I'm a good steward of the land.	0
ClaimBuster	22445				That is my agenda and that is why I think that it's not just a question of experience.	0
ClaimBuster	22446				I'll be glad to respond.	0
ClaimBuster	22447				... on some of the issues that people care about tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	22448				But I would never let that friendship with the People's Republic of China stand in the way of the preservation of the independence and freedom of the people on Taiwan.	0
ClaimBuster	22449				The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can't find work.	1
ClaimBuster	22450				Thanks to the miraculous sacrifice of doctors and nurses, the child stayed alive for six months and then died.	1
ClaimBuster	22451				I can make American safer than President Bush has made us.	0
ClaimBuster	22452				We established eighty-four new mental health treatment centers.	1
ClaimBuster	22453				And then long-term we've got to fix our health care system, we've got to fix our energy system that is putting such an enormous burden on families.	0
ClaimBuster	22454				I don't disagree with anything that the President said, except he waited four years to do these things, and my view is it ought to be, it will be done on Day 1.	0
ClaimBuster	22455				But it's also that his entire life he has never forgotten where he came from, coming from Scranton, fighting on behalf of working families, remembering what it's like to see his father lose his job and go through a downward spiral economically.	1
ClaimBuster	22456				That's the main growing thing in the budget.	0
ClaimBuster	22457				I believe that the United States ha- had many successes in recent years, in recent months, as far as the Communist movement is concerned.	0
ClaimBuster	22458				As well, help is on the way, but it's certainly hard to tell it when he voted against the $87-billion supplemental to provide equipment for our troops, and then said he actually did vote for it before he voted against it.	1
ClaimBuster	22459				America gained by continuing the dignity, the decency that has characterized us and it's that that keeps the prestige of America up, not running down America the way Senator Kennedy has been running her down.	0
ClaimBuster	22460				And if we meet our responsibilities I think freedom will conquer.	0
ClaimBuster	22461				Yeah, no question about that, but there also needs to be strong enforcement of the law.	0
ClaimBuster	22462				So we have to look at this comprehensively.	0
ClaimBuster	22463				You'll live in a world, hopefully, that is more educated so it's less likely you'll be harmed in your neighborhood.	0
ClaimBuster	22464				By the president having five powers - four or five powers - and he only has very limited powers today, neither the company nor the union would be sure which power would be used; and therefore, there would be a greater incentive on both sides to reach an agreement themselves without taking it to the government.	0
ClaimBuster	22465				I proposed a constitutional amendment.	1
ClaimBuster	22466				Testing is the cornerstone of reform.	0
ClaimBuster	22467				When I'm President of the United States we're going to have a governors' council and we're going to work directly with the governors to get power back to the people and back to the states.	0
ClaimBuster	22468				Everything comes out of your pocket and my pocket.	1
ClaimBuster	22469				I think that militarily we are as strong as any nation on earth.	0
ClaimBuster	22470				He has done a superb job in getting the prime minister of South Africa, Mr. Vorster, to agree that the time had come for a solution to the problem of Rhodesia.	1
ClaimBuster	22471				But I'll tell you what I was thinking of.	0
ClaimBuster	22472				But that -- that is not the case.	0
ClaimBuster	22473				But it isn't going to be working that way.	0
ClaimBuster	22474				Most health-care costs are covered by third parties.	1
ClaimBuster	22475				What I've seen -- what I've seen is so bad.	0
ClaimBuster	22476				I was in the Senate before I became secretary of state.	1
ClaimBuster	22477				What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens?	0
ClaimBuster	22478				And those teachers can make a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	22479				$3,000 tax credit to help your expenses in taking care of a loved one who needs long-term care.	0
ClaimBuster	22480				What I criticized was the failure of the Administration to use its great influence to persuade the Cuban government to hold free elections, particularly in 1957 and 1958.	0
ClaimBuster	22481				It's to make sure we have fiscal sanity and keep taxes low.	0
ClaimBuster	22482				I look at Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	22483				Whether it's Iran-contra, Iraq-gate or you name it, it's a steady stream.	0
ClaimBuster	22484				I think the people should understand that two-thirds of the defense budget pays for pay and salary, or pay and pension.	1
ClaimBuster	22485				When we think of Russia, remember we're thinking of many countries, now.	0
ClaimBuster	22486				He didn't succeed and I signed it and I'm glad I did.	1
ClaimBuster	22487				We have gone a long way toward correcting these problems, but we still have a long way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	22488				We could look also at other items which Senator Kennedy has named, but I will only conclude by saying this: in this whole matter of prestige, in the final analysis, its whether you stand for what's right.	0
ClaimBuster	22489				Now, the question is, can we win?	0
ClaimBuster	22490				That's what Washington, D.C. needs.	0
ClaimBuster	22491				And there's a whole bunch of other things that I can't click off in this short period of time.	0
ClaimBuster	22492				What we're now talking about is the Vice President's determination to guarantee Quemoy and Matsu, which are four and five miles off the coast of Red China, which are not within the treaty area.	1
ClaimBuster	22493				I want to make America as great as it can be and I ask for your help in doing it.	0
ClaimBuster	22494				I said, do you get audited?	0
ClaimBuster	22495				But each and every one of us can start thinking about how can we save energy in our homes, in our buildings.	0
ClaimBuster	22496				But no president of the United States, in my opinion, should signal in advance to a prospective enemy, what his uhh - decision might be or what option he might exercise.	0
ClaimBuster	22497				And unfortunately now he is trying to reassert himself in Serbian politics.	0
ClaimBuster	22498				They're moving about eight or nine days in Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	22499				And thank God, it has, because the parents of these young people around here go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war.	0
ClaimBuster	22500				And it's very important that we not continue to let our industrial base deteriorate.	0
ClaimBuster	22501				Donald, she has a name.	1
ClaimBuster	22502				And when he crossed the line, I stood up and looked into the camera and I said: This aggression will not stand.	1
ClaimBuster	22503				Now it's in over 30 countries.	1
ClaimBuster	22504				They pulled out of the global warming, declared it dead, didn't even accept the science.	1
ClaimBuster	22505				I believe parents ought to be able to make more choices need more public and charter school choice to send their kids always to a safe school.	0
ClaimBuster	22506				But when the president of the United States is doing something that's right, something that is for the purpose of defending the security of this country against surprise attack, he can never express regrets or apologize to anybody, including Mr. Khrushchev.	0
ClaimBuster	22507				We have got to pull together.	0
ClaimBuster	22508				And the result over time was the Taliban, Al Qaida, and a lot of the difficulties we are facing today.	0
ClaimBuster	22509				And we're going to have to eliminate those that aren't working.	0
ClaimBuster	22510				I do think that sensible gun safety measures are warranted now.	0
ClaimBuster	22511				The quality of the air is cleaner since I've been the president of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	22512				My opponent voted against it.	1
ClaimBuster	22513				We have every two years tests that look at how well our kids are doing.	1
ClaimBuster	22514				I mean, there's-I don't think this is a fair argument.	0
ClaimBuster	22515				Here we are with a government that's been dealing with a drug-running Panamanian dictator.	1
ClaimBuster	22516				My record going back to 1965 in the Congress, the first vote we had was whether or not you should put a little notice on cigarettes.	1
ClaimBuster	22517				And we can renew and rekindle the American spirit and make our future what our founders dreamed it could be.	0
ClaimBuster	22518				And because we didn't listen to the freeze advocates, and strengthen the defense of this country, we now have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age.	1
ClaimBuster	22519				This is not an easy situation.	0
ClaimBuster	22520				If we make the right choices, we can have a prosperity that endures and enriches all of our people.	0
ClaimBuster	22521				Now, I said there was a contrast.	1
ClaimBuster	22522				And if you really want to get involved, just tap into my home page, www.DoleKemp96.org.	0
ClaimBuster	22523				What kind of rights will Americans have?	0
ClaimBuster	22524				I don't claim to know all the answers.	0
ClaimBuster	22525				It's a question between trust and fear, and I would say, I think, Mr. President, about all you've got going in this campaign is fear.	0
ClaimBuster	22526				Here are some promises that I'll make to you now.	0
ClaimBuster	22527				It isn't just naive; it's dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	22528				An economy that has 23 million people looking for work is not a strong economy.	1
ClaimBuster	22529				I also believe in the Golden Rule.	0
ClaimBuster	22530				The American working man and woman are not taxed too little.	0
ClaimBuster	22531				I merely say that the United States should meet its commitments to Que- to uh - Formosa and the Pescadores.	0
ClaimBuster	22532				Obviously, that law waived the statute of limitations, which you could have gone back 20 or 30 years.	1
ClaimBuster	22533				That is the bottom line.	0
ClaimBuster	22534				Well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted.	1
ClaimBuster	22535				Well, I hope all of those Americans out there who are watching us, listening to us and trying to make up their mind about which one of us ought to be president of the United States listen to the Vice President very carefully.	0
ClaimBuster	22536				I think it would be contrary to one of the basic concepts in our system of government - a system of checks and balances.	0
ClaimBuster	22537				First of all, vouchers are up to states.	0
ClaimBuster	22538				So I'm happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I've done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead, with your 30 years, and I'll let the American people make that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	22539				Now, referring to your question with regard to Quemoy and Matsu.	0
ClaimBuster	22540				But if you want change, you need to get somebody that knows how to bring Republicans and Democrats together to get positive things done for America.	0
ClaimBuster	22541				In order to lead, you first have to use the White House as a bully pulpit and lead; then you have to develop consensus or you can't get anything done, and that's where we are now.	0
ClaimBuster	22542				I thought we were going to have equal time, but maybe I just have to interrupt the other 2.	0
ClaimBuster	22543				If it's administered swiftly, justly and fairly, it saves lives.	0
ClaimBuster	22544				And -- and that is not a right strategy for us to move forward.	0
ClaimBuster	22545				Number one, I want to build manufacturing jobs in this country again.	0
ClaimBuster	22546				They ought to say this is the most important thing we do as a state.	0
ClaimBuster	22547				I'm just gonna tell you what the real facts are.	0
ClaimBuster	22548				In 1988 when the war between Iraq and Iran ended, we knew Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, we had dealt with him because he was against Iran -- the enemy of my enemy maybe is my friend.	1
ClaimBuster	22549				And I can recall cases where people would cross the street rather than meet somebody in a wheelchair.	0
ClaimBuster	22550				But with General Ridgway, Mr. Herter, General Collins, Admiral Spruance and many others, I think it's unwise to take the chance of being dragged into a war which may lead to a world war over two islands which are not strategically defensible, which are not, according to their testimony, essential to the defense of Formosa.	0
ClaimBuster	22551				We got to have health care for all Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	22552				That is my commitment to you.	0
ClaimBuster	22553				But I didn't pick Lloyd Bentsen because he was a clone of Mike Dukakis.	1
ClaimBuster	22554				Let's put the American people to work, and let's build the kind of high-tech, high-wage, high-growth economy that the American people deserve.	0
ClaimBuster	22555				Another one is to invest and save and to stimulate growth.	0
ClaimBuster	22556				We've done a lot to give the people more powers to make their own decisions over their own lives.	1
ClaimBuster	22557				We reduced more regulations, eliminated more programs than my two Republican predecessors.	1
ClaimBuster	22558				You deal with Russia based on, what are your -- what are the national security interests of the United States of America?	0
ClaimBuster	22559				Senator Obama has approved storage and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.	1
ClaimBuster	22560				Put it to you bluntly, American people.	0
ClaimBuster	22561				Mondale was referring to an earlier debate between George Bush and Geraldine Ferarro, the Vice-Presidential candidates.	1
ClaimBuster	22562				Senator Kennedy has said tonight again what he has said several times in the course of this - these debates and in the campaign, that American is standing still.	1
ClaimBuster	22563				And after we reform it, it won't be a lifetime career opportunity; good people will go serve and then go back to their homes and not become foreign lobbyists and cash in at 30,000 bucks a month and then take time off to run some president's campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	22564				In fact, just recently steelworkers in Ohio and throughout the Midwest -- Pennsylvania -- are in a position now to sell steel to China because we won that case.	1
ClaimBuster	22565				Otherwise, if we find the heads of state meeting and not making progress, we will find that the cause of peace will have been hurt rather than helped.	0
ClaimBuster	22566				You know, he said some time ago, he said he would forgo his tax increases if the economy was bad.	1
ClaimBuster	22567				I don't want to --	0
ClaimBuster	22568				So this is the way the president has overextended the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	22569				And I just said to you earlier, town hall meeting after town hall meeting, parents come with kids, children -- precious children who have autism.	1
ClaimBuster	22570				We've got one in Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	22571				Tonight I say to the President: Mr. Bush, for 12 years you've had it your way.	0
ClaimBuster	22572				He did not do so.	1
ClaimBuster	22573				The governor has declined to endorse that idea even though the Republican as well as Democratic leaders in Congress have endorsed it.	1
ClaimBuster	22574				The average senior citizen is spending a higher percentage of income on health care today than they were in 1965, before Medicare came in.	1
ClaimBuster	22575				Now, I'm going to restore what we did in the 1990s, ladies and gentlemen: pay as you go.	0
ClaimBuster	22576				I'm going to spend some money on the key issues that we've got to work on.	0
ClaimBuster	22577				First of all, Israel is a true friend.	1
ClaimBuster	22578				You didn't want a status of...	0
ClaimBuster	22579				We went over, we got them out, we brought them back home.	1
ClaimBuster	22580				And he said also that his two favorite justices are Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas.	1
ClaimBuster	22581				And to give them technology of this kind, I disagree with.	0
ClaimBuster	22582				We would have to stretch out our aircraft procurement, we would have to reduce our naval construction program, we would have to reduce the uh - research and development for the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and Marines by 8 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	22583				And, Alan (ph), thank you for your question.	0
ClaimBuster	22584				They want to make sure that they have a roof over their heads and that they have the prospects of a better life in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	22585				It can be a single-parent family.	0
ClaimBuster	22586				It's an example of how oftentimes we may be associated with organizations all of whose particular positions we don't support, even though we support in general the hope that over time, particularly if we can get those reductions in strategic weapons, if we can get a comprehensive test ban treaty, if we can negotiate with the Soviet Union and bring down the level of conventional forces in Europe with deeper cuts in the Soviet side, yes, at some point it may be possible to reduce defense outlays and use those for important things here at home, like jobs and job training and college opportunity and health and housing and the environment and the things that all of us care about.	0
ClaimBuster	22587				In the last three months before an election, they're always for the programs that they always fight the other three-and-one-half years.	1
ClaimBuster	22588				One of the additional powers that I would suggest would be seizure.	0
ClaimBuster	22589				And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they've not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices.	1
ClaimBuster	22590				I think, habitually, Governor Reagan has advocated the injection of military forces into troubled areas, when I and my predecessors - both Democrats and Republicans - have advocated resolving those troubles in those difficult areas of the world peacefully, diplomatically, and through negotiation.	0
ClaimBuster	22591				More and more people get on the rolls as poverty increases.	1
ClaimBuster	22592				We landed on this Eastern shore and then went out over the mountains and the prairies and the deserts and the far western mountains to the Pacific, building cities and towns and farms, and schools and churches.	1
ClaimBuster	22593				And I pay for every dime of it.	0
ClaimBuster	22594				All of these things can be done.	0
ClaimBuster	22595				But, also, I have the ability, and the knowledge, and the background to make the right judgments, to keep this country safe and secure.	0
ClaimBuster	22596				I don't see any evidence that it's a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime.	0
ClaimBuster	22597				Actually, Mitch McConnell had a minimum-wage plan that I supported that would have increased the minimum wage.	1
ClaimBuster	22598				People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do.	0
ClaimBuster	22599				It ought not to be a strength of bombast and threats.	0
ClaimBuster	22600				Americans ought to have it too.	0
ClaimBuster	22601				My answer is, we're not going to spend taxpayers' money on abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	22602				We need to have a new look about how we conduct ourselves in office.	0
ClaimBuster	22603				There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.	0
ClaimBuster	22604				During this campaign we've seen a lot of television shows, a lot of bumper stickers, and a great many uh - slogans of one kind or another.	0
ClaimBuster	22605				On the Amendment that you mentioned, I abandoned it 15 years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	22606				It puts a heavy burden on a state like -- except for emergencies.	0
ClaimBuster	22607				Well, I would say in the latter that the - and that's what I found uh - somewhat unsatisfactory about the figures uh - Mr. Nixon, that you used in your previous speech, when you talked about the Truman Administration.	0
ClaimBuster	22608				They've cut the training money.	1
ClaimBuster	22609				I can tell you, it's rife.	0
ClaimBuster	22610				Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries.	1
ClaimBuster	22611				And fourth, I believe that the polls and other studies and votes in the United Nations and anyone reading the paper and any citizen of the United States must come to the conclusion that the United States no longer carries the same image of a vital society on the move with its brightest days ahead as it carried a decade or two decades ago.	0
ClaimBuster	22612				Perhaps some of that land needs to be set aside.	0
ClaimBuster	22613				She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people.	1
ClaimBuster	22614				Now, I did want to pick up on one of the statements earlier, and maybe I have heard, maybe I have heard the previous statements wrong, Governor.	0
ClaimBuster	22615				What about drugs that have increased, doubled in the last 44 months?	1
ClaimBuster	22616				It means their job is tougher.	0
ClaimBuster	22617				Just -- just -- just a quick follow-up, because I think -- I think this is important.	0
ClaimBuster	22618				This is what it takes to have a sound foreign policy strong at home, strong defense, permanent commitments, not betray the principles of our country, and involve the American people and the Congress in the shaping of our foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	22619				Another is to pass -- to get our seniors to sign up to these drug discount cards, and they're working.	0
ClaimBuster	22620				Make your decision and vote on November the 3rd.	0
ClaimBuster	22621				I'm for research and development.	0
ClaimBuster	22622				Uh - in the crisis of 1973 it was supposed to be a temporary agency, uh now it's permanent, it's enormous, it's growing every day.	1
ClaimBuster	22623				Barbara, one of the blights on this world is the threat and the activities of terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	22624				"He keeps saying, ""Look, I've created 5 million jobs."""	1
ClaimBuster	22625				I've got some news, Senator Obama, the news is bad.	0
ClaimBuster	22626				Why can't they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we've knocked out the leaders, we've had a tremendous success?	0
ClaimBuster	22627				There's a bill on the floor of the United States Senate that he could have showed up and voted for if he's so much for it.	1
ClaimBuster	22628				Obviously energy is going to be a big, big factor.	0
ClaimBuster	22629				No president had ever taken on the tobacco lobby before.	1
ClaimBuster	22630				I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual.	0
ClaimBuster	22631				Number three, we've got to control our own energy.	0
ClaimBuster	22632				I went to meet with the members of the Security Council in the week before we voted.	1
ClaimBuster	22633				Some small business owners, a lot of them, can't even afford health insurance for themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	22634				I think there are things to do in this regard.	0
ClaimBuster	22635				He is out there on out of the mainstream.	0
ClaimBuster	22636				Well, look, I understand your frustration and your cynicism, because while you've been carrying out your responsibilities -- most of the people here, you've got a family budget.	0
ClaimBuster	22637				But I don't think private schools should have a right to take taxpayer money away from public schools at a time when Caley Ellis is standing in that classroom.	0
ClaimBuster	22638				The American people want to keep opening doors.	0
ClaimBuster	22639				And I believe it'll work because, as Ross said, we got the plans.	0
ClaimBuster	22640				It will help change the world; that we can look back and say we did our duty.	0
ClaimBuster	22641				That's not the kind of small business promotion we need.	0
ClaimBuster	22642				A testimony to you, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	22643				And obviously we hope that diplomacy works before you ever use force.	0
ClaimBuster	22644				I think the American people deserve better than they're getting.	0
ClaimBuster	22645				I'm for working with the groups, not just with industry but also with the citizen groups and local communities to control sprawl in ways that the local communities themselves come up with.	1
ClaimBuster	22646				Providing funding to universities and think tanks is great.	0
ClaimBuster	22647				The elements of government through these tax incentives For example, a business that would not have, for a period of time, an increase in the property tax reflecting its development of the unused property that it was making wouldn't be any loss to the city because the city isn't getting any tax from that now.	1
ClaimBuster	22648				As I indicated, our objectives are to replace Assad and to have in place a new government which is friendly to us, a responsible government, if possible.	1
ClaimBuster	22649				That's what a President's for.	0
ClaimBuster	22650				Interesting phenomenon: small towns have good schools, big cities have terrible schools.	0
ClaimBuster	22651				I just want to take one of those points, again, attacking me as not talking about an agenda for -- for getting more trade and opening up more jobs in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	22652				Maybe in your case maybe just two.	0
ClaimBuster	22653				These were areas on which Senator Dole and I differed, but I believed they were the right areas for America to be acting together as one country to help individuals and families make the most of their own lives and raise their kids with good values and a good future.	0
ClaimBuster	22654				We're doing the best we possibly can to share information.	0
ClaimBuster	22655				And I think that's the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	22656				As a matter of fact, when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary -- elected a Republican senator to stop Obamacare, you pushed it through anyway.	1
ClaimBuster	22657				And now they're campaigning on getting prescription drugs for seniors.	1
ClaimBuster	22658				Which is a big mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	22659				And I think we've now got so many examples around the country that we really have to find ways to end this.	0
ClaimBuster	22660				But I can say that I am dedicated to proceeding, and I met just last week with the foreign minister of the Soviet Union, and he indicated to me that uh - the Soviet Union was interested in narrowing the differences and making a realistic and a sound compromise.	1
ClaimBuster	22661				And how do we do that?	0
ClaimBuster	22662				We relied on the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Middle East, which passed the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	22663				She doesn't want to say that, but that's what's happened, and that's what happened big league.	1
ClaimBuster	22664				It's taken months and months and months to get Mr. Bush and the administration to support that legislation, and they're still resisting.	1
ClaimBuster	22665				I believe a free Afghanistan is in this nation's interest.	0
ClaimBuster	22666				If you look at what's happened -- we've made progress, I want to say that at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	22667				I have my own little foundation that's raised about $10 million for the disabled.	1
ClaimBuster	22668				Give the government back to the people.	0
ClaimBuster	22669				I hadn't gotten around to reregistering as yet.	1
ClaimBuster	22670				He says that he's going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform, but we don't know exactly which ones.	1
ClaimBuster	22671				I do understand how to make things work.	0
ClaimBuster	22672				For a while, as I recall, it even seems to me that there was talk of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana and other drugs, and I think that's all wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	22673				I remember getting my future back from doctors and nurses and a doctor in Chicago named Dr. Kalikian .	1
ClaimBuster	22674				We find that more have been built in this Administration than in the previous Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	22675				Depends on how we respond to Russia and it depends on a lot of things.	0
ClaimBuster	22676				And as a result, they're like tinderboxes.	0
ClaimBuster	22677				It is because we've had 12 years of trickle down economics.	1
ClaimBuster	22678				Wear your safety toe shoes when you go.	0
ClaimBuster	22679				Give us a balanced budget amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	22680				He says he's for voluntary testing.	1
ClaimBuster	22681				There were seventy votes for our position and none for theirs.	1
ClaimBuster	22682				I'm going to protect the working man by continuing to veto, and to threaten to veto until we get this new Congress, and then we're going to move forward on our plan.	0
ClaimBuster	22683				But it wou- uh - evidently uh - under the handling of the case it was not.	0
ClaimBuster	22684				Our relationship with the People's Republic of China is based upon the Shanghai Communique, of 1972, and that communique, calls for the normalization of relations between the United States and the People's Republic.	1
ClaimBuster	22685				General Brown has an exemply [sic] record of military performance.	1
ClaimBuster	22686				It's wind, tide, solar, natural gas, nuclear, off-shore drilling, which Senator Obama has opposed.	1
ClaimBuster	22687				"He won't use the term ""radical Islamic terrorism."""	0
ClaimBuster	22688				The present leadership uh - there is uh - is fairly uniform in - in their purpose, and I think it's a close-knit group, uh - and uh - I think it would be unwise for us to say that we will go to war uh - in Yugoslavia uh - if the Soviets should invade, which I think would be an extremely unlikely thing.	0
ClaimBuster	22689				I support a strong national patient's bill of rights.	1
ClaimBuster	22690				But of the people listening tonight, the working families who will benefit from economic packages, they'll be better off when Bob Dole is president and Jack Kemp is vice president.	0
ClaimBuster	22691				That's got to be changed.	0
ClaimBuster	22692				I've been for faith-based initiatives helping to intervene in the lives of young children for years.	1
ClaimBuster	22693				And I merely say that they - if they elect me president, I will do my best to carry the United States through a difficult period; but I would not want people to elect me because I promised them the easy, soft life.	0
ClaimBuster	22694				The last candidate who indicated that he knew who his cabinet was going to be was Mr. Dewey in 1948.	1
ClaimBuster	22695				But people make their own choice.	0
ClaimBuster	22696				Well, we stand with Israel, but we have maintained the ability to serve as an honest broker.	1
ClaimBuster	22697				And I have budgeted for that.	1
ClaimBuster	22698				An Air Force General not too long ago in Europe who said that pretty soon we'd have airplanes without engines, tank commanders who can't drive their tanks more than three-quarters of a mile, because they don't have enough fuel.	1
ClaimBuster	22699				When he ran for the United States Senate from Illinois, he said he would have a middle-income tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	22700				It is breaking family budgets.	0
ClaimBuster	22701				I'll restore that $716 billion to Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	22702				But understand, we only have three to four percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil, which means that we can't drill our way out of the problem.	1
ClaimBuster	22703				I think my plan is better.	0
ClaimBuster	22704				If you look at his record in the Senate, he voted to break the caps -- the spending caps -- over 200 times.	1
ClaimBuster	22705				So to answer your question is, we're withdrawing, not from the world, we're withdrawing manpower so they can be stationed here in America, so there's less rotation, so life is easier on their families and therefore more likely to be -- we'll be more likely to be able to keep people in the all-volunteer army.	0
ClaimBuster	22706				Yeah, in the Reagan recession where unemployment hit 10.8 percent, between that period -- the end of that recession and the equivalent of time to today, Ronald Reagan's recovery created twice as many jobs as this president's recovery.	1
ClaimBuster	22707				I believe it's important to resist the temptation to squander our surplus.	0
ClaimBuster	22708				And your co-payments and deductibles have gone up 30 percent just in the last year alone.	1
ClaimBuster	22709				I can tell you that if you were to elect President Obama, you know what you're going to get.	0
ClaimBuster	22710				These are constitutional rights, and I want to make sure we have judges who interpret the Constitution of the United States according to the law.	1
ClaimBuster	22711				Because NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	22712				And I would say to those I know there are more young people experimenting with drugs today than ever before; drug use has gone up.	1
ClaimBuster	22713				To this day, he has never had a hearing.	1
ClaimBuster	22714				Affirmative action doesn't mean quotas.	0
ClaimBuster	22715				See, all the folks up there at the top said the attention span of the American people is no more than 5 minutes, they won't watch it.	1
ClaimBuster	22716				But we also have to be smart, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	22717				Should the President's age and stamina be an issue in the political campaign?	0
ClaimBuster	22718				I'm totally opposed to diverting one out of every six dollars out of the Social Security trust fund, as the Governor has proposed, into the stock market.	1
ClaimBuster	22719				I believe, though -- I believe, as sure as I'm sitting here, that most Americans really care.	0
ClaimBuster	22720				There's lots we can do in the Pentagon where dishonest contractors have been lining their pockets at the expense of the American taxpayer.	0
ClaimBuster	22721				And that means that we can't have any test of religion.	0
ClaimBuster	22722				Now, does that mean you're not struggling?	0
ClaimBuster	22723				And I think you can use the White House as a bully pulpit to stress the importance of these little children, particularly in their young and formative years, to mold these little precious pieces of clay so that they, too, can live rich full lives when they're grown.	0
ClaimBuster	22724				Far be it from me to suggest otherwise.	0
ClaimBuster	22725				You know, back in April, I put out a statement saying that the situation in Georgia was unsustainable because you had Russian peacekeepers in these territories that were under dispute.	1
ClaimBuster	22726				I don't believe trickle down economics will work.	0
ClaimBuster	22727				But we don't use those people.	1
ClaimBuster	22728				And incidentally, we have got to preserve Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	22729				The United States cannot continue to carry the major share of this burden by itself.	0
ClaimBuster	22730				I don't believe in discrimination.	0
ClaimBuster	22731				This president has left them in shatters across the globe, and we're now 90 percent of the casualties in Iraq and 90 percent of the costs.	1
ClaimBuster	22732				I mean, you've got to stand up and fight somewhere, folks.	0
ClaimBuster	22733				That means that in the middle of the next decade, any car you buy, you're going to end up going twice as far on a gallon of gas.	1
ClaimBuster	22734				We cannot cast aside these regulations.	0
ClaimBuster	22735				And I think where I differ with the Governor of Massachusetts, because I am optimistic.	0
ClaimBuster	22736				Maybe in Idaho, to take care of the requirements, nuclear material requirements, for our Defense Department?	0
ClaimBuster	22737				No, there's been no change of heart.	0
ClaimBuster	22738				General McKiernan, the commander in Afghanistan right now, is desperate for more help, because our bases and outposts are now targets for more aggressive Afghan -- Taliban offenses.	1
ClaimBuster	22739				They haven't formed a unity group, a council of some kind.	0
ClaimBuster	22740				But it's very hard for Republican's in Congress to support comprehensive immigration reform, if their standard bearer has said that, this is not something I'm interested in supporting.	0
ClaimBuster	22741				It would have destroyed the economy of California, and, I must say, we had the support of Congress when we pointed out how ridiculous this attempt was by the Environmental Protection Agency.	1
ClaimBuster	22742				Because they have the opportunity to reenter the community of nations, and we would welcome that.	0
ClaimBuster	22743				My brother probably died partly because of cigarettes.	0
ClaimBuster	22744				And congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary.	0
ClaimBuster	22745				I think that would be a mistake, because when I've sent young men and women into harm's way, I always understand that that is the last resort, not the first resort.	0
ClaimBuster	22746				I would suggest that these proposals could be mentioned.	0
ClaimBuster	22747				The Federal Government continues to spend too much.	0
ClaimBuster	22748				I would hope, under a different monetary policy, that it would be possible to reduce that interest-rate burden, at least a billion dollars.	0
ClaimBuster	22749				What I'm going to do is say to Jim Baker when this campaign is over, all right, let's sit down now, you do in domestic affairs what you've done in foreign affairs, be kind of the economic coordinator of all the domestic side of the House, and that includes all the economic side, all the training side, and bring this program together.	0
ClaimBuster	22750				Now, I'm all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera.	0
ClaimBuster	22751				And as I said, this is not a partisan thing with me.	0
ClaimBuster	22752				Liberal, conservative, you put whatever label you want on it.	0
ClaimBuster	22753				You can't do it on the war, where he says well, I was with the minority but I guess I would have voted with the majority.	1
ClaimBuster	22754				I think uh - the uh - increase and the uh - prospects as far as I'm concerned and the I - less favorable prospects for Governor Carter, reflect that Governor Carter uh - is inconsistent in many of the positions that he takes.	0
ClaimBuster	22755				Now, the new president of Pakistan, Kardari (sic), has got his hands full.	0
ClaimBuster	22756				And General Brown has indicated uh - his apology, his regrets, and I think that will, uh - in this situation, settle the matter.	1
ClaimBuster	22757				But why it is outrageous is because, for political advantage, every time they do that, they scare millions of senior citizens who are totally dependent on Social Security, have no place else to turn.	0
ClaimBuster	22758				The whole philosophy of the Republican party, including uh - my opponent, has been to pile on taxes on low-income people to take 'em off on the corporations.	0
ClaimBuster	22759				And so far as the summit conference is concerned, it should only be entered in upon, it should only be agreed upon, if the negotiations have reached the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other than some phony spirit - a spirit of Geneva, or Camp David, or whatever it is.	0
ClaimBuster	22760				They actually said that she lied.	1
ClaimBuster	22761				We spend more on education 'cause we spend so much more on colleges.	1
ClaimBuster	22762				And I'm very proud of that.	0
ClaimBuster	22763				I am absolutely -- I apologize for those words.	0
ClaimBuster	22764				And remember the Federal deficit has come down $70 billion in one year, in 1987.	1
ClaimBuster	22765				When we took office, we discovered that the program that the Carter-Mondale administration had said would solve the fiscal problems of Social Security for the next 50 years wouldn't solve them for 5.	1
ClaimBuster	22766				America is still the greatest producer, exporter and importer.	0
ClaimBuster	22767				I don't know which is worse, not knowing or knowing and not stopping it.	0
ClaimBuster	22768				We are currently spending $10 billion a month in Iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus.	1
ClaimBuster	22769				And, you know, we visited the website quite a bit and it still doesn't work.	1
ClaimBuster	22770				I believe we need to be strong, and I will keep us strong.	0
ClaimBuster	22771				Uh - I uh - agreed to give the interview uh - to Playboy Other people have done it who are notable - uh - Governor Jerry Brown, uh - Walter Cronkite, uh - Albert Schweitzer, Mr. Ford's own secretary of the treasury, Mr. Simon, uh - William Buckley - many other people.	1
ClaimBuster	22772				But I want a diverse administration, I think it's important.	0
ClaimBuster	22773				So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal.	0
ClaimBuster	22774				And then the president began what I have called an apology tour, of going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America.	1
ClaimBuster	22775				"And when Governor Romney stands here, after a year of campaigning, when during a Republican primary he stood on stage and said ""I'm going to give tax cuts"" -- he didn't say tax rate cuts, he said ""tax cuts to everybody,"" including the top 1 percent, you should believe him because that's been his history."	1
ClaimBuster	22776				Because if we can keep our prosperity going, if we can continue balancing the budget and paying down the debt, then the strong economy keeps generating surpluses.	0
ClaimBuster	22777				The Social Security system was fixed about 5 years, and I think it's projected out to be sound beyond that.	1
ClaimBuster	22778				So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one.	0
ClaimBuster	22779				Nothing will ever top NAFTA.	0
ClaimBuster	22780				There is an issue with the uninsured, there sure is.	0
ClaimBuster	22781				She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website.	1
ClaimBuster	22782				And, you know, we've heard a lot about -- from the governor about not much being done in the last eight years, as if the promises that I made eight years ago have not been kept.	1
ClaimBuster	22783				And, obviously, stricter interpretation and consolidation of the various regulatory agencies that weren't doing their job, that has brought on this crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	22784				We believe that you can uhh - do something more effectively with a moderate increase in money in the drug abuse program.	0
ClaimBuster	22785				Joe wants to buy the business that he has been in for all of these years, worked 10, 12 hours a day.	0
ClaimBuster	22786				What we really should focus on tonight is what we still have to do to help the American people make the most of this future that's out there.	0
ClaimBuster	22787				I've just as high a devotion, just as high an opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	22788				And as long as they are not essential to the defense of Formosa, it's been my judgment ever since 1954, at the time of the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Far East, that our line should be drawn in the sea around the island itself.	0
ClaimBuster	22789				Since I became president, 43, 44 countries have gone democratic, no longer totalitarian, no longer living under dictatorship or communist rule.	1
ClaimBuster	22790				And Detroit had dragged its feet too long in terms of getting that done.	0
ClaimBuster	22791				I get the casualty reports every day.	1
ClaimBuster	22792				An economy with 50 percent of kids graduating from college that can't finds a job, or a college level job, that's not what we have to have.	1
ClaimBuster	22793				I would say Eastern Europe is the area of vulnerability of the uh - s- of the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	22794				So the United States, seeking to preserve the principle of self-determination, to eliminate the possibility of bloodshed, to protect the rights of the minority as we insisted upon the rights of the majority, uh - I believe followed the good conscience of the American people in foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	22795				... the irony is that we've seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there.	1
ClaimBuster	22796				And I guarantee you he would not -- he would not say that presidential top level.	0
ClaimBuster	22797				Now, you and I never got a ride on a lot of these yachts and fancy things it bought, but you and I are paying for it.	1
ClaimBuster	22798				Well, look, you know, I think that we expect presidential campaigns to be tough.	0
ClaimBuster	22799				You called it the gold standard of trade deals.	1
ClaimBuster	22800				And if we do, you don't have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine.	0
ClaimBuster	22801				The president gave the top 1 percent of income-earners in America, got $89 billion last year, more than the 80 percent of people who earn $100,000 or less all put together.	1
ClaimBuster	22802				I never suggested espionage should stop.	1
ClaimBuster	22803				Well, I'm not for photo licensing.	0
ClaimBuster	22804				In addition to that, I believe that this element of discrimination is something that the South has seen so vividly as a blight on our region of the country which has now been corrected - not only racial discrimination but discrimination against people that have to work for a living - because we have been trying to pick ourselves up by our bootstraps, since the long depression years, and lead a full and useful life in the affairs of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	22805				Now, I know that the only way he can win is to make everybody believe the economy's worse than it is.	0
ClaimBuster	22806				Once you have a policy, then you have to go out and be aggressive and enforce that policy.	0
ClaimBuster	22807				You indicated that we shouldn't be passing nuclear treaties with Russia despite the fact that 71 senators, Democrats and Republicans, voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	22808				But the name is there.	0
ClaimBuster	22809				But our long-term security depends on our deep faith in liberty.	0
ClaimBuster	22810				The size of government increased only one-sixth in California of what it increased in proportion to the population in Georgia.	1
ClaimBuster	22811				In addition, we're now able to transition out of Afghanistan in a responsible way, making sure that Afghans take responsibility for their own security.	0
ClaimBuster	22812				"I'm sorry we didn't have a foreign policy question, because just this week Secretary Christopher said, ""Well, we really didn't know much the first couple of years about foreign policy."""	0
ClaimBuster	22813				But it is also essential that he not allow a dollar spent that could be better spent by the people themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	22814				It can and will grow even more in the next four.	0
ClaimBuster	22815				Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up.	1
ClaimBuster	22816				It's a subject I'm very familiar with.	1
ClaimBuster	22817				That's why it's essential we win.	0
ClaimBuster	22818				With all due respect, you already gave them to the oil companies.	1
ClaimBuster	22819				And we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties.	0
ClaimBuster	22820				You've got to help us over there.	0
ClaimBuster	22821				Last week he said that they were spending 3.7 billion dollars, or 4.7 billion dollars on this.	1
ClaimBuster	22822				No, I'm not sure I can promise that; I don't think either one of us can really.	0
ClaimBuster	22823				He can say now that he no longer believes that a line should be drawn leaving these islands out of the perimeter of defense.	0
ClaimBuster	22824				But every economist - liberal, conservative that I'm familiar with - recognizes that in the fourth quarter of this year and in the fifth quar- uh - the first quarter of next year that we'll have an increase in real GNP.	0
ClaimBuster	22825				I believe in the Patriot Act.	0
ClaimBuster	22826				I find that deeply disturbing.	0
ClaimBuster	22827				We're talking about adding to or increasing 200 programs, 20,000 new bureaucrats.	1
ClaimBuster	22828				I appreciate your -- your question, and thank you for being here this evening and to all of those from Nassau County that have come, thank you for your time.	0
ClaimBuster	22829				And I promise you tonight that I'll try to address your concerns and not try to exploit them.	0
ClaimBuster	22830				Why not leave it with them?	0
ClaimBuster	22831				I stood there, and I met the people.	1
ClaimBuster	22832				No, there's no difference on that.	0
ClaimBuster	22833				It doesn't speak to the equality of America.	0
ClaimBuster	22834				Anyway, that's for another debate.	0
ClaimBuster	22835				That's why I have a plan for energy independence within 10 years.	0
ClaimBuster	22836				I found a couple of other things we agree upon.	0
ClaimBuster	22837				And the other thing I think is important...	0
ClaimBuster	22838				The question, I think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place?	0
ClaimBuster	22839				But we were succeeding to the point that the Lebanese Government had been organized -- if you will remember, there were the meetings in Geneva in which they began to meet with the hostile factional forces and try to put together some kind of a peace plan.	1
ClaimBuster	22840				And I want to tell you that one of the things I'm most proud of, among others, because I have worked across the aisle.	1
ClaimBuster	22841				And he said this about it.	0
ClaimBuster	22842				I think we've got to be very careful when we commit our troops.	0
ClaimBuster	22843				We've got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science.	0
ClaimBuster	22844				Now, that, I think, is one of the most serious, sort of, reversals or mixed messages that you could possibly send.	0
ClaimBuster	22845				I saw cases in West Virginia, here in the United States, where children took home part of their school lunch in order to feed their families because I don't think we're meeting our obligations toward these Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	22846				Her client she represented got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.	1
ClaimBuster	22847				Now we have a chance.	0
ClaimBuster	22848				And therefore, it seems to me that we should hold the lid, as we have, to the best of our ability so we can stimulate the private economy and get the jobs where the jobs are - five out of six in this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	22849				What kind of programs are we for?	0
ClaimBuster	22850				I believe it incumbent upon the next president of the United States to get this country moving again, to get our economy moving ahead, to set before the American people its goals, its unfinished business.	0
ClaimBuster	22851				Now, what was his response?	0
ClaimBuster	22852				I had a record of working with Republicans and Democrats as the governor of Texas, and I was hopeful I'd be able to do the same thing.	1
ClaimBuster	22853				And I doubt in all candor if the president knows it.	0
ClaimBuster	22854				We have met young America.	0
ClaimBuster	22855				And first let me say that our nation now needs to speak with one voice during this time, and I applaud the president for working hard to diffuse tensions.	0
ClaimBuster	22856				That's why I have a program for education, a program in the case of equal job opportunities, and one that would also deal with our older citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	22857				So at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average.	1
ClaimBuster	22858				You know, his -- his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney's talked about.	1
ClaimBuster	22859				The question is, are people getting health care, and we have a strong safety net, and there needs to be a safety net in America.	0
ClaimBuster	22860				And I think we'll have some decrease in our disbursements.	0
ClaimBuster	22861				I'm not going to do that; I won't do that.	0
ClaimBuster	22862				And Business Week, which is not a Democratic publication, said that this Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal - and I quote them, I think - was completely irresponsible and would result in inflationary pressures which would destroy this nation.	1
ClaimBuster	22863				When I took office, the worst war in Europe was waging in Bosnia.	1
ClaimBuster	22864				The purpose of this debate and the outcome of the election will determine three basic things: Leadership, upholding the principles of our country, and proper priorities and commitments for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	22865				Because after eight years of failed policies, he and I both agree that what we're going to have to do is to reprioritize, make sure that we're investing in the American people, give tax cuts not to the wealthiest corporations, but give them to small businesses and give them to individuals who are struggling right now, make sure that we finally get serious about energy independence, something that has been languishing in Washington for 30 years, and make sure that our kids get a great education and can afford to go to college.	0
ClaimBuster	22866				I can't think of any.	0
ClaimBuster	22867				And I don't think it should do that.	0
ClaimBuster	22868				A $10,000 deduction a year for the cost of college tuition.	0
ClaimBuster	22869				Now in addition, we had a very - some very good news in the reduction in the rate of inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	22870				So I have to stand up for myself.	0
ClaimBuster	22871				I know the private sector is.	0
ClaimBuster	22872				And I hope you'll give me an opportunity to serve again.	0
ClaimBuster	22873				Because this is not just a -- a health issue, it's an economic issue for women.	0
ClaimBuster	22874				But in almost every category they're lagging.	1
ClaimBuster	22875				If I don't like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company.	0
ClaimBuster	22876				Mr. President, once again, I happen to be against the amendment, because I think the amendment will take this problem out of the hands of elected legislators and put it in the hands f unelected judges.	0
ClaimBuster	22877				I know we're not going to achieve our objective if we send mixed signals to our troops, our friends, the Iraqi citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	22878				And most Americans know the difference.	1
ClaimBuster	22879				Our military is meant to fight and win war.	0
ClaimBuster	22880				We need the missile, I think, because we are so out of balance strategically that we lack a deterrent to a possible first assault.	0
ClaimBuster	22881				But uh - if - if you could just do away with the ones that are unfair, you could lower taxes for everyone.	0
ClaimBuster	22882				The mayors that I've talked to in some of our leading cities tell!	0
ClaimBuster	22883				That's what the war on terror is about.	0
ClaimBuster	22884				Keep in mind in 1960, when our schools were the envy of the world, we were spending $16 billion on them; now we spend more than any other nation in the world -- 199 billion a year -- and rank at the bottom of the industrialized world in terms of education achievement.	1
ClaimBuster	22885				So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work.	0
ClaimBuster	22886				She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later.	0
ClaimBuster	22887				We've got to control that growth to inflation and population increase, but not raise taxes on the American people now.	0
ClaimBuster	22888				If we can come together, nothing can stop us.	0
ClaimBuster	22889				Well, Alan (ph), thank you very much for the question.	0
ClaimBuster	22890				Secretary Bill Perry negotiated that under President Clinton.	1
ClaimBuster	22891				I was not put on the ballot by either of the 2 parties; I was not put on the ballot by any PAC money, by any foreign lobbyist money, by any special interest money.	1
ClaimBuster	22892				I think government- run health will lead to poor-quality health, will lead to rationing, will lead to less choice.	0
ClaimBuster	22893				But we're bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	22894				That was not a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	22895				I want to reduce the size of the classrooms in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	22896				As far as aid for school construction is concerned, I favor that, as Senator Kennedy did, in January of this year, when he said he favored that rather than aid to s- teacher salaries.	1
ClaimBuster	22897				And if we do that, we can have an impact.	0
ClaimBuster	22898				That's an overwhelming support from my own people who know me best.	0
ClaimBuster	22899				I've asked in my security briefings why that is, and I can't go into all the answers, et cetera, but let me say this to you.	0
ClaimBuster	22900				If you have a child, you got a $1,000 child credit.	1
ClaimBuster	22901				And Colin Powell so stated.	1
ClaimBuster	22902				I'm going to give a new direction to this economy in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	22903				And in some ways, it may be difficult to -- to reconcile the two views.	0
ClaimBuster	22904				There ought to be filters in public libraries and filters in public schools so if kids get on the Internet, there is not going to be pornography or violence coming in.	0
ClaimBuster	22905				...of forces agreement at the end of the conflict that existed.	0
ClaimBuster	22906				And as commander-in-chief, that is something that I've worked on and thought about every single day that I've been in the Oval Office.	0
ClaimBuster	22907				Peter, it's one of the most agonizing decisions a president has to make.	0
ClaimBuster	22908				Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.	0
ClaimBuster	22909				My argument with Governor Clinton -- you can call it mud wrestling, but I think it's fair to put it in focus is -- I am deeply troubled by someone who demonstrates and organizes demonstration in a foreign land when his country's at war.	0
ClaimBuster	22910				Bob, let's not go into hypotheticals of that nature.	0
ClaimBuster	22911				Many people predicted what happened, and it was a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	22912				I take him for his word.	0
ClaimBuster	22913				Now, maybe I'm expected to ask that same question again.	0
ClaimBuster	22914				And a number of pages were excised by that agency head there, the man in charge, and he sent it on up here to CIA, where more pages were excised before it was printed.	1
ClaimBuster	22915				... the damage in his -- in his own party.	0
ClaimBuster	22916				This year Mr. Ford will not pass more than 26 percent of all the legislative proposals he puts forward.	0
ClaimBuster	22917				But let's stop labeling each other and lets' get to the heart of the matter which is the future of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	22918				And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	22919				They may be danger -- I voted I for everything since that time.	1
ClaimBuster	22920				If we're an arrogant nation, they'll resent us.	0
ClaimBuster	22921				As president of the United States, people are going to be held accountable in my administration.	0
ClaimBuster	22922				But it's important for us to recognize that we can't just walk away from Pakistan.	0
ClaimBuster	22923				Talk to the people that are working in those industries.	0
ClaimBuster	22924				I'm the president and I'm always responsible, and that's why nobody's more interested in finding out exactly what happened than I do.	1
ClaimBuster	22925				And they have been using these things to have government, through court orders, inhibit the practice of religion.	1
ClaimBuster	22926				But absolutely we can be secure in the long run.	0
ClaimBuster	22927				But I think that -- I just was watching some of the proceedings of the American Bankers Assn, and I think the general feeling is most of the banks are sound, certainly there's no comparison here between what happened to the S&Ls and where the banks stand right now, in my view.	0
ClaimBuster	22928				Actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth.	1
ClaimBuster	22929				So there's a great deal of cynicism out there.	0
ClaimBuster	22930				"He complains about the fact our troops don't have adequate equipment, yet he voted against the $87 billion supplemental I sent to the Congress and then issued one of the most amazing quotes in political history: ""I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it."""	1
ClaimBuster	22931				But let me talk just a minute about what we've done to avoid secrecy in the Ford administration.	0
ClaimBuster	22932				And the approach I took is one that I think is a balanced and necessary approach, to balance science and the concerns for life.	0
ClaimBuster	22933				Now, that's the kind of presidency I believe in.	0
ClaimBuster	22934				And the money is used to pay the benefits for seniors this year.	1
ClaimBuster	22935				It means our border patrol will be more likely to be able to focus on doing their job.	0
ClaimBuster	22936				I want people in my administration and will have people in my administration who understand America.	0
ClaimBuster	22937				I have proposed a league of democracies, a group of people - a group of countries that share common interests, common values, common ideals, they also control a lot of the world's economic power.	0
ClaimBuster	22938				He has not indicated his support of an attempt to provide fair employment practices around the country, so that everyone can get a job regardless of their race or color.	1
ClaimBuster	22939				Those are the concerns of the people that are watching us tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	22940				Not necessarily be in power, but here's what I'll say about the $87 billion.	0
ClaimBuster	22941				The average middle-class family with children would pay about $2,000 more.	1
ClaimBuster	22942				I would be willing to continue to raise the payment for shipment of goods through the Panama Canal Zone.	0
ClaimBuster	22943				If I'm the president, we're going to have emergency room care, we're going have gag orders, we're going to have direct access to OB/GYN.	0
ClaimBuster	22944				Everybody says it'll create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	22945				And that is fundamentally the wrong way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	22946				Now, why do I support the freeze?	0
ClaimBuster	22947				Have no environmental controls, no pollution controls and no retirement.	0
ClaimBuster	22948				So this rescue package means that we will stabilize markets, we will shore up these institutions.	0
ClaimBuster	22949				And this is -- this is Georgian territory.	1
ClaimBuster	22950				One of them is in defense spending, because I've taken on some of the defense contractors.	0
ClaimBuster	22951				Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney's going to have a busy first day, because he's also going to repeal Obamacare, which will not be very popular among Democrats as you're sitting down with them.	0
ClaimBuster	22952				Once a health-care program ends up in a line item in the federal government budget, it leads to more controls.	0
ClaimBuster	22953				Well, she said she was awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o'clock in the morning, but I won't even mention that.	1
ClaimBuster	22954				We are supposed to be operating under a U.N. resolution.	0
ClaimBuster	22955				I want you to have your own asset that you can call your own.	0
ClaimBuster	22956				This uh - talking about more people at work - uh is distorted because with a 14 percent increase in the cost of living in the last uh - two years, it means that - that women and young people have had to go to work when they didn't want to because their fathers didn't make enough to pay the increased cost of uh - food and uh housing and clothing.	1
ClaimBuster	22957				I don't think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and I don't think Senator Dole supports using using drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	22958				That was something that advanced the entire country.	0
ClaimBuster	22959				Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked.	1
ClaimBuster	22960				She went over a minute over, and you don't stop her.	1
ClaimBuster	22961				And he's called that because he's supposed to be in charge of the facts and run our government and strengthen our nation.	0
ClaimBuster	22962				And he could have lowered the cost of Medicare and lowered your taxes and lowered the costs to seniors.	0
ClaimBuster	22963				Secondly, we spend $4.7 billion a year on the uninsured in the State of Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	22964				Now, in my budget for the next ten years I propose $100 billion for this purpose.	0
ClaimBuster	22965				And I'm not gonna exclude the American people from that process in the future, as Mr. Ford and Kissinger have done.	1
ClaimBuster	22966				But we kept the debate going, and we kept this issue to -- to posing to Americans the danger that climate change opposes.	1
ClaimBuster	22967				And we'll have companies that will grow and expand and start from new.	0
ClaimBuster	22968				That's part of the reason why the Libyans stand with us.	0
ClaimBuster	22969				And this fellow stood up, and he was quivering.	1
ClaimBuster	22970				Third, we've got all kinds of agreements on paper, and some that are being executed on getting rid of nuclear warheads.	1
ClaimBuster	22971				Our housing programs have uh - gone bad.	1
ClaimBuster	22972				I want 100 percent of the American people to have a bright and prosperous future.	0
ClaimBuster	22973				Productivity in this country is up, it is way up -- productivity is up.	0
ClaimBuster	22974				Yes, it's a tough problem as Mr. Bush says, but it√É¬è√¢‚Äö¬¨s not an insolvable problem.	0
ClaimBuster	22975				And we've got a wonderful new superintendent there who's working very hard with the young mayor there to try...	1
ClaimBuster	22976				What if we had a homestead act, and said to the people, for $1 we sell you this house.	0
ClaimBuster	22977				I just object to the fact that we cover up and hide things.	0
ClaimBuster	22978				"But the president just arbitrarily brought the hammer down and said, ""Nope."	1
ClaimBuster	22979				"When the Secretary General Kofi Annan offered the United Nations, he said, ""No, no, we'll go do this alone."""	1
ClaimBuster	22980				I helped double the NIH budget to $28 billion a year to find cures.	1
ClaimBuster	22981				We did, actually, send troops into Rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measures.	1
ClaimBuster	22982				But I will tell you what isn't fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	22983				And we are on pace to double our exports, one of the commitments I made when I was president.	1
ClaimBuster	22984				Didn't even guard the ammo dumps.	1
ClaimBuster	22985				Listen, there is 30 nations involved in Iraq, some 40 nations involved in Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	22986				You don't want to join the International Criminal Court just because it's popular in certain capitals in Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	22987				We've brought twice as many cases against unfair trading practices than the previous administration and we've won every single one that's been decided.	1
ClaimBuster	22988				Well, it's a combination, Chris.	0
ClaimBuster	22989				But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt.	1
ClaimBuster	22990				Mr. Bush vetoed it twice because he says we can't do something seventy-two other countries do, even though there was a small business exemption.	1
ClaimBuster	22991				A president can't do that.	0
ClaimBuster	22992				But it does say insurance companies can't jerk you around.	0
ClaimBuster	22993				I ask Hillary, why doesn't -- she made $250 million by being in office.	0
ClaimBuster	22994				Get people who don't have any interest in politics but understand the issue and let them make the recommendation to Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	22995				It was a very different George Bush who was talking much more sympathetically about the freeze in the spring of 1982 than he is today.	0
ClaimBuster	22996				If he'd let the inspectors do their job and go on, we wouldn't have 10 times the numbers of forces in Iraq that we have in Afghanistan chasing Osama bin Laden.	1
ClaimBuster	22997				I -- I hope so.	0
ClaimBuster	22998				But we also need well-equipped and well-trained and well-supported conventional forces.	0
ClaimBuster	22999				Milosevic's government refuses to release the vote count.	1
ClaimBuster	23000				The worst thing we could do in this economic climate is to raise people's taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	23001				The president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more -- if you will, trickle-down government -- would work.	1
ClaimBuster	23002				When you have 900 files gathered up by some guy who is a bouncer in a bar and hired a security officer to collect files, in Watergate -- I know a person who went to jail for looking at one file, one FBI file.	1
ClaimBuster	23003				I believe that in those cases where international custom calls for the expression of a regret, if that would have kept the summit going, in my judgment it was a proper action.	0
ClaimBuster	23004				I know we need to ban partial birth abortions.	0
ClaimBuster	23005				$30 billion, even cut funds for scholarships and college loans.	1
ClaimBuster	23006				I'm not sure I get -- help me with the question and I'll try to answer it.	0
ClaimBuster	23007				You'd exempt Social Security -- I don't want to tax or touch Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	23008				My opponent looked at the same intelligence I looked at and declared in 2002 that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat.	1
ClaimBuster	23009				At a very early age they learn how to learn.	0
ClaimBuster	23010				So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	23011				We will have the lower rate of inflation for the uh - calendar year this year - something slightly under 6 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	23012				I would be willing as president to meet with Mr. Khrushchev or any other world leader if it would serve the cause of peace.	0
ClaimBuster	23013				But there's no doubt that we're not going to be able to do everything that I think needs to be done.	0
ClaimBuster	23014				I was not the standard bearer.	1
ClaimBuster	23015				So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving.	0
ClaimBuster	23016				Those who suffered from discrimination because of race or sex certainly knew we had a racial problem.	0
ClaimBuster	23017				Believe it or not folks, you can't ship it all overseas, you've got to make it here.	0
ClaimBuster	23018				We're not going to have a draft so long as I am the president.	0
ClaimBuster	23019				For example, this Congress, very shortly, will spend a billion dollars a year for its housekeeping, its salaries, its expenses and the like.	0
ClaimBuster	23020				In addition to that, we've suffered because we haven't had leadership in this administration.	0
ClaimBuster	23021				I therefore suggest that in those basic commodities which are supported, that the federal government, after endorsement by the farmers in that commodity, attempt to bring supply and demand into balance - attempt effective production controls - so that we won't have that five or six per cent surplus which breaks the price fifteen or twenty per cent.	1
ClaimBuster	23022				We've got a government of stalemate.	0
ClaimBuster	23023				I've often heard President Eisenhower in discussing this question, make the statement that if we once start the process of indicating that this point or that point is not the place to stop those who threaten the peace and freedom of the world, where do we stop them?	1
ClaimBuster	23024				I believe that part of the reason we have a difficult situation is because we made a bad judgment going into Iraq in the first place when we hadn't finished the job of hunting down bin Laden and crushing al Qaeda.	0
ClaimBuster	23025				When I was in a rope line just the other day, coming out here from Wisconsin, a couple of young returnees were in the line, one active duty, one from the Guard.	1
ClaimBuster	23026				There is no doubt in my mind that in the downtown central cities, with the, with the new commitment on an energy policy, with a chance to revitalize homes and to make them more fuel efficient, with a chance for our synthetic fuels program, solar power, this will give us an additional opportunity for jobs which will pay rich dividends.	0
ClaimBuster	23027				And it focuses not only on increasing the supply, which I think we have to do, but also on working on the consumption side.	0
ClaimBuster	23028				And that's why I want to get the deficit down by controlling the growth of mandatory spending.	0
ClaimBuster	23029				And I'm saying to Barbara, you know, we've always kept family as a bit of an oasis for us.	0
ClaimBuster	23030				So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.	0
ClaimBuster	23031				We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election.	1
ClaimBuster	23032				She lied when she said she didn't call it the gold standard in one of the debates.	1
ClaimBuster	23033				But I think we should start by greatly expanding the so-called child health insurance or CHIP program to give health insurance to every single child in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	23034				The NIH is doing a good job in research.	0
ClaimBuster	23035				Certainly not right when it's happening.	0
ClaimBuster	23036				Sometimes they don't like the decisions made by America, but I don't think you want a president who tries to become popular and does the wrong thing.	0
ClaimBuster	23037				If you include Iran, our present shipment of weapons to the Middle East, only 20 percent goes to Israel.	1
ClaimBuster	23038				It is -- I'm not so sure 80% of the people get the death tax.	1
ClaimBuster	23039				That's key to the strength of our nation.	0
ClaimBuster	23040				...here's one thing I've learned as commander in chief.	0
ClaimBuster	23041				Right here in St. Louis, you've laid off 350 teachers.	1
ClaimBuster	23042				By cutting off trade, by cutting off our diplomatic relations as we have, we will quarantine this regime so that the people of Cuba themselves will take care of Mr. Castro.	1
ClaimBuster	23043				A lot of us are.	0
ClaimBuster	23044				And under my plan, in four years, as the percentage of our gross domestic product, federal spending will be the smallest that it has been in 50 years.	0
ClaimBuster	23045				I want to make sure we've got the best education system in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	23046				So 77 government programs, everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but weren't working very well, 18 government -- 18 government programs for education that were well-intentioned, not weren't helping kids learn, we went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars, $50 billion of waste taken out of the system.	1
ClaimBuster	23047				And the question in this election is: are we going to pass on that same American dream to the next generation?	0
ClaimBuster	23048				because you see China moving towards a free market economy.	1
ClaimBuster	23049				You must understand the region; you must understand the politics in the area; you must provide a strong alternative; and you must show strength -- and all at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	23050				We did it in my state, and we can do it nationally.	1
ClaimBuster	23051				I didn't want to give a slush fund to Halliburton.	0
ClaimBuster	23052				I hope and trust, in the best interest of both countries, and in the best interests of all people throughout this globe, that the Soviet Union and the United States can make a mutually beneficial agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	23053				Iran is at its weakest point, economically, strategically, militarily, then since -- then in many years.	1
ClaimBuster	23054				Does that mean that Saddam Hussein was 10 times more important than Osama bin Laden -- than, excuse me, Saddam Hussein more important than Osama bin Laden?	0
ClaimBuster	23055				Some of them I've got a conflict of interest on, if you know what I mean.	0
ClaimBuster	23056				We need to have transparency.	0
ClaimBuster	23057				Till you change it you're gonna be unhappy.	0
ClaimBuster	23058				Now, these are the conditions that I can lay out.	0
ClaimBuster	23059				It's important that we do that.	0
ClaimBuster	23060				That is something that every family that advocates on behalf of disabled children talk about.	0
ClaimBuster	23061				Every part of my program I've shown how I'm going to pay for it.	1
ClaimBuster	23062				We got the most expensive health care system in the world; it ranks behind 15 other nations when we come to life expectancy, and 22 other nations when we come to infant mortality.	1
ClaimBuster	23063				Here is what I believe, sir.	0
ClaimBuster	23064				My plan requires testing of all students.	0
ClaimBuster	23065				And I think what others could do for our country and themselves if we did the welfare reform thing in the proper way.	0
ClaimBuster	23066				And many of the public schools are meeting the call.	1
ClaimBuster	23067				The so-called Nixon shock against Japan had weakened our relationships there.	0
ClaimBuster	23068				You walk in, you put your little card in there.	0
ClaimBuster	23069				China should solve that problem for us.	0
ClaimBuster	23070				We canceled the B - 1 under the previous administration.	1
ClaimBuster	23071				Now we have the highest spending by Senator Obama's campaign than any time since Watergate.	1
ClaimBuster	23072				The -- first of all, I think Governor Romney was for an assault weapons ban before he was against it.	1
ClaimBuster	23073				I assume she had nothing to do with it.	0
ClaimBuster	23074				I'm sure you probably have heard that.	0
ClaimBuster	23075				... she's going to vote this November.	0
ClaimBuster	23076				People will look it up.	0
ClaimBuster	23077				But that's already the law and that doesn't help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions.	1
ClaimBuster	23078				This is the way it ought to work, give more power back to the states and back to the people back to the taxpayers, not always the long arm of the federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	23079				They've tried to undo them.	0
ClaimBuster	23080				I'll answer it straight to America.	0
ClaimBuster	23081				And I'm pretty good at it.	0
ClaimBuster	23082				In dealing with terrorists, yes, we want to retaliate, but only if we can put our finger on the people responsible and not endanger the lives of innocent civilians there in the various communities and in the city of Beirut where these terrorists are operating.	0
ClaimBuster	23083				As Senator Kennedy points out that as far as his one proposal is concerned - the one for medical care for the aged - that that would be financed out of Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	23084				They also have cut four billion dollars off of mutual security in these last six years.	1
ClaimBuster	23085				Uh - it seems to me that there should have - be an opportunity, uh - as long as it's voluntary, as long as there is no uh - compulsion whatsoever, that uh - an individual ought to have that right.	0
ClaimBuster	23086				And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	23087				And most of that tax cut went to the wealthiest people in the country.	1
ClaimBuster	23088				The last point I want to make on the issue of abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	23089				I don't know how to deal with it exactly.	0
ClaimBuster	23090				I questioned his judgment and his character.	1
ClaimBuster	23091				And if a crisis comes up, I ask who has the judgment and the experience and, yes, the character to make the right decision?	0
ClaimBuster	23092				And unless we're ready to carry out programs like that in the sixties, this battle for economic survival which these people are waging are going to be lost.	0
ClaimBuster	23093				The United States is a strong country.	0
ClaimBuster	23094				And so I'm proud of my choice.	0
ClaimBuster	23095				And we've got a robust research and development program that has been ongoing during my administration.	1
ClaimBuster	23096				You know, I've made some decisions on Israel that's unpopular.	1
ClaimBuster	23097				And number is to grow the economy, because if more people work in a growing economy, they're paying taxes, and you can get the job done that way.	0
ClaimBuster	23098				But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that -- because there is a problem.	0
ClaimBuster	23099				Barb and I lost a child, you know that we lost a daughter, Robin.	1
ClaimBuster	23100				As soon as we get the economy on a sound ground as well, I'd like to see the total repeal of indexing.	0
ClaimBuster	23101				You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders.	0
ClaimBuster	23102				These are they types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation, and I am opposed to that.	0
ClaimBuster	23103				She called it the gold standard.	1
ClaimBuster	23104				And the WIC program, and the school lunch program with senators like George McGovern, Hubert Humphrey and others, to name a few of my Democratic friends.	1
ClaimBuster	23105				And production on private -- on government land --	0
ClaimBuster	23106				Today, according to Prime Minister Rabin, the Soviet Union is weaker in the Middle East than they have been in many, many years.	1
ClaimBuster	23107				I think we're going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us.	0
ClaimBuster	23108				The private market and individual responsibility always work best.	1
ClaimBuster	23109				And incidentally, an excellent -- I mean, I think our success over the last eight years has not been in spite of diversity but because of it.	0
ClaimBuster	23110				As a matter of fact, uh - I've never advocated any cut of $15 billion in our defense budget.	1
ClaimBuster	23111				I see on the TV screens how hard it is.	0
ClaimBuster	23112				"In my faith tradition, it is -- it's written in the book of Matthew, ""Where your heart is, there is your treasure also."""	1
ClaimBuster	23113				We had to get their permission.	0
ClaimBuster	23114				Of course, the vice president is questioning my patriotism.	0
ClaimBuster	23115				Secondly, I did not criticize him for not calling for free elections.	0
ClaimBuster	23116				The American people will be called upon to tighten their belts a bit in meeting some of the problems that we face domestically.	0
ClaimBuster	23117				I would rather lose a campaign about decency than win a campaign about self-interest.	0
ClaimBuster	23118				I'd like to ask the American people what, what's been accomplished.	0
ClaimBuster	23119				And so the question is, who will safeguard this nation, who will safeguard our people and our children?	0
ClaimBuster	23120				And when you go through the process of registration, you in effect, are penalizing that individual who uses his gun for a very legitimate purpose.	0
ClaimBuster	23121				Almost every lawyer says, you don't release your returns until the audit's complete.	1
ClaimBuster	23122				Now, step one was a rescue package that was passed last week.	1
ClaimBuster	23123				His was what he's done to women.	0
ClaimBuster	23124				And as far as currency manipulation, the currency has actually gone up 11 percent since I've been president because we have pushed them hard.	1
ClaimBuster	23125				He said the Republican primary was rigged against him.	1
ClaimBuster	23126				Cheapest money you'll ever spend.	0
ClaimBuster	23127				The lesson was that in the aftermath of World War I, we kind of turned our backs and left them to their own devices and they brewed up a lot of trouble that quickly became World War II.	0
ClaimBuster	23128				They named him because of his votes.	1
ClaimBuster	23129				He points out that he would make pay-as-you-go be the basis for our natural resources development.	0
ClaimBuster	23130				That's the nature of the enemy, by the way.	0
ClaimBuster	23131				Well, I respect everything that the president has said and certainly respect his faith.	0
ClaimBuster	23132				And incidentally, one of them is this.	0
ClaimBuster	23133				And I want to help people in the middle-class.	0
ClaimBuster	23134				We're standing with you strong.	0
ClaimBuster	23135				But it can sure be made better.	0
ClaimBuster	23136				On the one hand, it's a good deal but on the other hand I'd make it better.	0
ClaimBuster	23137				That we ought to ... in addition to that, we ought to pay those retirement benefits on the basis of once a year, rather than twice a year, and save $750 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	23138				It's catastrophic in certain ways.	0
ClaimBuster	23139				Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal -- he's another real winner that you have -- and he's the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that.	1
ClaimBuster	23140				I'm for a massive reform of the estate tax or the death tax.	0
ClaimBuster	23141				They think the only way to do it is for the federal government to do it all.	0
ClaimBuster	23142				And because they didn't have a judicial intervention where she could go somewhere and get help, I voted against it.	1
ClaimBuster	23143				In regard to uh - price stability uh - I'm not aware that that committee did produce recommendations that ever were certainly before the Congress from the point of view of legislation in regard to controlling prices.	1
ClaimBuster	23144				I'm a product of it and I want to help that dream come true for every single citizen in this land, with a good job and good wages, with good schools in every part of this country and every community in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	23145				She trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career.	1
ClaimBuster	23146				Now why were we successful, as our predecessors were not successful?	0
ClaimBuster	23147				We have thumbprint, fingerprint technology today.	1
ClaimBuster	23148				Well, President, you're -- Mr. President, you're absolutely right, which is that, with regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not -- not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate, they're taxed at a lower rate.	1
ClaimBuster	23149				Don't have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have.	0
ClaimBuster	23150				I should have held out for a better deal that would have protected the taxpayer and not ended up doing what we had to do, or what I thought at the time would help.	0
ClaimBuster	23151				But we're going to give you additional choices like they give federal employees in the federal employee health plan.	0
ClaimBuster	23152				You see, we'll never be able to compete in the 21st century unless we have an education system that doesn't quit on children, an education system that raises standards, an education that makes sure there's excellence in every classroom.	0
ClaimBuster	23153				And then, on the floor of the Illinois State Senate, he voted present.	1
ClaimBuster	23154				And that clock is ticking.	0
ClaimBuster	23155				Senator Kennedy has indicated on several occasions in this program tonight that I have been misstating his record and his figures.	1
ClaimBuster	23156				The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn't work.	1
ClaimBuster	23157				But we get the job done.	0
ClaimBuster	23158				Now, I honor your service in World War II, I honor Mr. Perot's service in uniform and the service of every man and woman who ever served, including Admiral Crowe, who was your Chairman of the joint Chiefs and who's supporting me.	1
ClaimBuster	23159				I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah they are around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	23160				But I have a write-off, a lot of it's depreciation, which is a wonderful charge.	0
ClaimBuster	23161				I promise you I will keep mine.	0
ClaimBuster	23162				But the Saudi's and the Qatari, and -- and the Turks are all very concerned about this.	0
ClaimBuster	23163				And another one is: stimulate investment and savings.	0
ClaimBuster	23164				It's not the America that we have to have in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	23165				I mean, we're going to have kind of a nation building core from America?	0
ClaimBuster	23166				Ann, the Vice President made that pledge.	1
ClaimBuster	23167				I hope Mr. Ford doesn't either.	0
ClaimBuster	23168				I'll tell you what PAYGO means, when you're a senator from Massachusetts, when you're a colleague of Ted Kennedy, pay go means: You pay, and he goes ahead and spends.	0
ClaimBuster	23169				He said the centerpiece in my first four years is going to be a middle class tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	23170				I see a future when the world is at peace, with the United States of America promoting the values of democracy and human rights and freedom all around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	23171				I remember going down to Del Rio, Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	23172				It is only in that way that we can persevere.	0
ClaimBuster	23173				It's been looked, When I was chairman of the finance committee which handled Social Security we looked at all these options, and one thing we've got to make certain, when I used to go home my mother would tell me all I've got is my Social Security, don't touch it.	1
ClaimBuster	23174				But the joint chiefs say we're stronger and more confident and solid than ever.	1
ClaimBuster	23175				He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation.	1
ClaimBuster	23176				This is a matter of life and death.	0
ClaimBuster	23177				If he's serious about what he's saying, then the only place he can go to balance that budget is to raid the Social Security Trust Fund, and he tried that in 1985, and I think he's going to try it again.	1
ClaimBuster	23178				I've spelled out my position.	0
ClaimBuster	23179				They've never endorsed a presidential candidate.	1
ClaimBuster	23180				Trade grows about 12 percent year.	1
ClaimBuster	23181				So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people.	0
ClaimBuster	23182				And Mr. Bush is right - the two go hand in hand.	0
ClaimBuster	23183				If these young Americans don't have the skills that make them attractive to employees, they're not going to get jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	23184				I am looking to cut taxes for middle-income people.	0
ClaimBuster	23185				I worry about morale in today's military.	0
ClaimBuster	23186				And I have worked and I admire President Obama.	1
ClaimBuster	23187				Property crime is down 40 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	23188				The surge has been successful and the training program is proceeding apace.	1
ClaimBuster	23189				And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they're too good?	0
ClaimBuster	23190				I do it right at this time particularly because when we have Khrushchev in this country - a man who has enslaved millions, a man who has slaughtered thousands - we cannot continue to have a situation where he can point the finger at the United States of America and say that we are denying rights to our citizens.	1
ClaimBuster	23191				And first, he was going to dig a racetrack and have it going around in the racetrack so it would meet the requirements of SALT II treaty, and now he's decided it'll have a straight up and down thing, so it can he both verifiable and yet hideable from the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	23192				Well, look, Bob, as I said...	0
ClaimBuster	23193				We ought to be doing that.	0
ClaimBuster	23194				And it's my proposal, it's not Senator Obama's proposal, it's not President Bush's proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	23195				Number four, make sure we protect the integrity with the Medicare program and Medicaid program and not do anything in cutting costs which would cause hundreds of hospitals to close which could have been the case if the 270billion dollar Medicare cut that I vetoed, had been enacted in the law.	1
ClaimBuster	23196				And if we're going to find a permanent, fundamental answer to this, it goes to American economic and trade policies that permit these nations to have a chance to get on their own two feet and to get prosperity, so that they can have jobs for themselves and their people.	0
ClaimBuster	23197				All you have to do is speak to them.	0
ClaimBuster	23198				You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year '17, it is a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	23199				Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us.	0
ClaimBuster	23200				5000 students -- why is a high school that big?	0
ClaimBuster	23201				Which was a program under this administration, and how it worked exactly I think we don't know precisely, where thousands of automatic, and AK-47 type weapons were -- were given to people that ultimately gave them to -- to drug lords.	1
ClaimBuster	23202				And the vice president doesn't believe in exploration in Alaska.	1
ClaimBuster	23203				I would only suggest that while we do not take the credit for it - I would not presume to - that since that committee has been formed the price line has been held very well within the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	23204				The people have to make a choice between Mr. Nixon and myself, between the Republican party and the Democratic party, between our approach to the problems which now disturb us as a nation and disturb us as a world power.	0
ClaimBuster	23205				I don't want to --	0
ClaimBuster	23206				I don't mean to be critical of uh - Senator Mondale, but uh - I was uh - very, very surprised when I read that uh - Senator Mondale made a very derogatory, very personal comment about General Brown uh - after the news story that uh - broke about General Brown.	1
ClaimBuster	23207				See that the young people of America, particularly, have faith in the ideals of freedom and faith in God, which distinguishes us from the atheistic materialists who oppose us.	0
ClaimBuster	23208				Maybe I'm trying to save the money.	0
ClaimBuster	23209				I think that was a dereliction of duty.	0
ClaimBuster	23210				This is a great country, but I think it could be a greater country; and this is a powerful country, but I think it could be a more powerful country.	0
ClaimBuster	23211				Well, he'd rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us.	0
ClaimBuster	23212				If we fail, if we fail to move ahead, if we fail to develop sufficient military and economic and social strength here in this country, then I think that uh - the tide could begin to run against us.	0
ClaimBuster	23213				What does the President have to say about taking responsibility for a Vice President who won't apologize for something like that?	0
ClaimBuster	23214				And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw.	1
ClaimBuster	23215				Now, all of that can happen, but I have to ask you to do one thing: Join me in rolling back the president's unaffordable tax cut for people earning more than $200,000 a year.	0
ClaimBuster	23216				Started off as a humanitarian mission and it changed into a nation-building mission, and that's where the mission went wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	23217				It means seeing that our economy moves forward even faster than it has.	0
ClaimBuster	23218				Younger worker after younger worker hears my call that says I trust you.	1
ClaimBuster	23219				I won the Democratic nomination in fifty-one separate contests.	1
ClaimBuster	23220				I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate.	0
ClaimBuster	23221				And by working with all of the nations in the region -- unlike the policies of this administration and unlike the President said, they have not supported negotiations in that region -- we will be much stronger, because we'll have the moral authority that goes with those efforts.	1
ClaimBuster	23222				Discrimination ought to be punished but there ought to be equal opportunity.	0
ClaimBuster	23223				And I think that this uh - is one example where uh - a lot of people have selfish, grasping ideas now.	0
ClaimBuster	23224				So I know it can work; I've seen it happen.	0
ClaimBuster	23225				I chose Senator Walter Mondale.	1
ClaimBuster	23226				People are willing to take risks.	0
ClaimBuster	23227				I'm doing it because all my life I've fought for a system of justice in this country, a system in which every American has a chance to achieve the fullness in life without discrimination.	0
ClaimBuster	23228				And what about the mining of the harbors in Nicaragua which violated international law?	0
ClaimBuster	23229				To do what the Congress and Governor Clinton is suggesting, you'd isolate and ruin Hong Kong.	0
ClaimBuster	23230				All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years.	1
ClaimBuster	23231				And I subscribe completely to the spirit that Senator Kennedy has expressed tonight, the spirit that the United States should move ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	23232				He's done nothing about it.	1
ClaimBuster	23233				I need your support, I ask for your vote.	0
ClaimBuster	23234				He took his eye off the ball, off of Osama bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	23235				He can set up a fact-finding committee.	0
ClaimBuster	23236				You heard what I said about my tax plan.	1
ClaimBuster	23237				If we do that we start a chain reaction; because the Communists aren't after Quemoy and Matsu, they're a- they're after Formosa.	1
ClaimBuster	23238				Or do we want to go forward, marching together, as a nation of strength and that's going to continue to be strong?	0
ClaimBuster	23239				That's what we need more of, Candy.	0
ClaimBuster	23240				And they don't have the same capacities to attack the U.S. homeland and our allies as they did four years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	23241				I think the realities are that both Russia and China would probably pose significant obstacles.	0
ClaimBuster	23242				You have to be very careful of that because you have to protect the people who are already in the pipeline.	0
ClaimBuster	23243				"And so, when you say, ""There you go again'' -- people remember this, you know."	0
ClaimBuster	23244				In precinct politics in Texas and I've seen it at the national level.	0
ClaimBuster	23245				Because everybody's talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul.	1
ClaimBuster	23246				I'm pleased to be at the University of Denver, appreciate their welcome, and also the Presidential Commission on these debates.	0
ClaimBuster	23247				That's right at the middle class.	1
ClaimBuster	23248				We've got five-hundred thousand more Americans unemployed today than we had three months ago.	1
ClaimBuster	23249				I supported -- I supported that.	1
ClaimBuster	23250				Will a woman's right to choose be protected?	0
ClaimBuster	23251				The most recent figures, the last three months, on the third quarter of this year, the inflation rate is 7% - still too high, but it illustrates very vividly that in addition to providing an enormous number of jobs - nine million new jobs in the last three and a half years - that the inflationary threat is still urgent on us.	1
ClaimBuster	23252				Men's wages haven't gone up, gone down.	1
ClaimBuster	23253				Those issues you mentioned, Social Security, prescription drugs, the big drug companies are against the prescription drug proposal that I've made.	1
ClaimBuster	23254				We've got all kinds of giveaways.	0
ClaimBuster	23255				We need to have -- allow small businesses to write insurance across jurisdictional lines so small business can afford health care, small restaurants can afford health care.	0
ClaimBuster	23256				I believe that we could share more fully responsibilities for the Panama Canal Zone with Panama.	0
ClaimBuster	23257				What kind of message does it send to be sending money to open firehouses in Iraq, but we're shutting firehouses who are the first- responders here in America.	1
ClaimBuster	23258				He decides who the right people are.	1
ClaimBuster	23259				If we had done what Senator Obama wanted done in Iraq, and that was set a date for withdrawal, which General Petraeus, our chief -- chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff said would be a very dangerous course to take for America, then we would have had a wider war, we would have been back, Iranian influence would have increased, al Qaeda would have re- established a base.	0
ClaimBuster	23260				Well, the Social Security -- you're an expert and I could, I'm sure, learn from you the details of the Pension Guarantee Fund and the Social Security Fund.	0
ClaimBuster	23261				I proved that I will sign reasonable tort reform.	0
ClaimBuster	23262				So that'll stay the same.	0
ClaimBuster	23263				And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people.	0
ClaimBuster	23264				We need to shift very strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measures.	0
ClaimBuster	23265				And to maintain that peace requires strength.	0
ClaimBuster	23266				It was because they were too extreme.	0
ClaimBuster	23267				The president said he'd cut the deficit in half.	1
ClaimBuster	23268				And that's what's gonna happen in the State of Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	23269				He's man of solid judgment and he's going to be a person to stand by my side.	0
ClaimBuster	23270				But on the big questions, about whether or not we should have gone into Afghanistan, the big question about whether we should have removed somebody in Iraq, I'll stand by those decisions, because I think they're right.	0
ClaimBuster	23271				The S & L crisis was over, they're starting to sell assets, all that money was coming in.	1
ClaimBuster	23272				Horace Greeley said the only thing that endures is character.	1
ClaimBuster	23273				This has been one of the highest level operations in the whole State Department right under the President himself.	1
ClaimBuster	23274				"When you guard the oil ministry, but you don't guard the nuclear facilities, the message to a lot of people is maybe, ""Wow, maybe they're interested in our oil."""	0
ClaimBuster	23275				Secondly, across Texas, typically half of the school day was non-academic pursuits -- in one place it was 35%.	1
ClaimBuster	23276				The CDC, responsible for health in the United States, is setting those priorities and is allocating the flu vaccine accordingly.	1
ClaimBuster	23277				We need to open up markets.	0
ClaimBuster	23278				We, as I have said earlier, fell below the national average in inflation when we did that.	1
ClaimBuster	23279				And I believe the people who pay the bills ought to get some money back.	0
ClaimBuster	23280				John, you heard the president just say that he thought he might try to be for it.	1
ClaimBuster	23281				He's mentioned some ways to do it--and I agree with those.	0
ClaimBuster	23282				A woman came to me and she said, look, I can't afford insurance for myself or my son.	1
ClaimBuster	23283				They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them.	1
ClaimBuster	23284				Health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family.	1
ClaimBuster	23285				But we have got to instill values in these young people.	0
ClaimBuster	23286				The doctor chooses the prescription that you need and nobody can overrule your doctor.	1
ClaimBuster	23287				We're going to do it like you do it.	0
ClaimBuster	23288				I think that defense needs to be -- with fewer people in permanent armed services but with greater mobility on the land, in the air and on the sea, with a real dedication to continuing development of high technology weaponry and well trained people.	0
ClaimBuster	23289				And we need to stand with him.	0
ClaimBuster	23290				Secondly, there is other forms of racial profiling that goes on in America.	0
ClaimBuster	23291				But the front on this war is more than just one place.	0
ClaimBuster	23292				In other words, unless we're going to do it, then pick somebody who likes to talk about it.	0
ClaimBuster	23293				And that means being smart about allowing people to be fully educated, to know what their options are in life, and making certain that you don't deny a poor person the right to be able to have whatever the constitution affords them if they can't afford it otherwise.	0
ClaimBuster	23294				But let me just address what the president just said.	0
ClaimBuster	23295				Well, the AmeriCorps program, I must say, if that's one of your successes, I wouldn't speak about it too loudly.	0
ClaimBuster	23296				But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth.	1
ClaimBuster	23297				Mosul is on the border of Syria.	1
ClaimBuster	23298				So I think first and foremost our power ought to be wielded to in ways that form a more perfect union.	0
ClaimBuster	23299				And we have now achieved an historic arms control agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	23300				The average person wasn't benefitting.	1
ClaimBuster	23301				Well, let me start with Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	23302				We need to fully fund the act named for that wonderful boy Ryan White to make sure we're doing everything we can on research and treatment.	0
ClaimBuster	23303				There's nothing -- the most efficient unit of government the world will ever know is a strong loving family unit.	0
ClaimBuster	23304				And I won't comment on other things that happened in your administration or your past about drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	23305				After setting priorities, I want to give some of your money back.	0
ClaimBuster	23306				We are going to start the engine rolling again, because...	0
ClaimBuster	23307				All of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith.	0
ClaimBuster	23308				Well Mr. Drummond, first of all, referring to Secretary Dulles' press conference, I think if you read it all - and I know that you have - you will find that Secretary Dulles also indicated in that press conference that when the troops were withdrawn from Quemoy, that the implication was certainly of everything that he said, that Quemoy could better be defended.	1
ClaimBuster	23309				Now, why did they reject it?	0
ClaimBuster	23310				And that's the way I feel.	0
ClaimBuster	23311				Let me make sure you understand my decision.	0
ClaimBuster	23312				I'm going to help the Latinos, Hispanics.	0
ClaimBuster	23313				We'll have 125,000 troops trained by the end of this year.	1
ClaimBuster	23314				Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers' salaries?	0
ClaimBuster	23315				We told him he could take the northern part of Kuwait, and when he took the whole thing, we went nuts.	1
ClaimBuster	23316				I suspect we won't agree here tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	23317				When I asked Yassir Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu to come to Washington and got them together and they talked alone for three hours, I was convinced that they had to have a chance to make that peace.	1
ClaimBuster	23318				Ladies and gentlemen, the right war was Osama bin Laden and Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	23319				And if I can't make a great deal -- then we're going to terminate NAFTA and we're going to create new deals.	0
ClaimBuster	23320				Did you approve of his diplomatic activity?	0
ClaimBuster	23321				Well, I'd like to go back just one moment to the previous question, where uh - Mr. Ford, I think, confused the issue by trying to say that we are shipping Israel 40 percent of our aid.	0
ClaimBuster	23322				The point -- the point is -- the point is, we need to examine every agency of government.	0
ClaimBuster	23323				And with regard to friendship below the border and with the countries down there, yes, no administration that I know has established the relationship that we have with our Latin friends.	0
ClaimBuster	23324				Let's get that straight right away.	0
ClaimBuster	23325				You ought to go out and see around this country what's happening in the volunteer section: Americans helping America.	0
ClaimBuster	23326				I know what it takes to get this to happen, and my plan will do that, and one part of it is to make sure that we keep China playing by the rules.	0
ClaimBuster	23327				I would hope that from this point on, we get to the issues that affect the vast majority of Americans, jobs, schools, health care, housing, the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	23328				A report on international terrorism chaired by the Vice President was released and made some very specific recommendations about how to deal with terrorism.	1
ClaimBuster	23329				And the result is exactly what we see.	0
ClaimBuster	23330				Now, the tax relief that I propose is directed specifically at middle-income individuals and families.	1
ClaimBuster	23331				Mixed messages send the wrong signals to the Iraqi citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	23332				I vote against them, my friends.	0
ClaimBuster	23333				It would be squandered, too, believe me.	0
ClaimBuster	23334				I will see that these standards apply to the United States Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	23335				Wasn't a top-down approach, Governor.	0
ClaimBuster	23336				Instead let people make their own choice.	0
ClaimBuster	23337				These are people that give of themselves everyday and every week and every month.	0
ClaimBuster	23338				I invited the former prime minister of Russia to my house and took a risk in asking him to get personally involved, along with the head of Finland, to go to Belgrade and to take a set of proposals from the United States that would constitute basically a surrender by Serbia.	1
ClaimBuster	23339				You have a U.S. attorney here that sends `em back home, so I think that's pretty important.	1
ClaimBuster	23340				It also exists among minority groups.	1
ClaimBuster	23341				(Laughter and applause) But--but--see, let me make it very clear.	0
ClaimBuster	23342				And 100 percent, John, of your ads -- 100 percent of them have been negative.	1
ClaimBuster	23343				Sometimes the views have been distorted.	0
ClaimBuster	23344				I want to see - when I talked at our convention about a thousand points of light, I was talking about the enormous numbers of shelters and organizations that help.	0
ClaimBuster	23345				The last point I'll make about small businesses.	0
ClaimBuster	23346				They say we should be satisfied.	0
ClaimBuster	23347				Let's look at our records, my friends, and then listen to my vision for the future of America.	0
ClaimBuster	23348				And let's give him the credit he deserves for organizing Operation Desert Storm and Desert Shield.	1
ClaimBuster	23349				(LAUGHTER) I -- there's an old high school debating trick, which is to answer something and then attack your opponent at the end.	0
ClaimBuster	23350				The mines are closed down; there are 22000 miners out of work.	1
ClaimBuster	23351				In the 1990s, I went to Beijing and I said women's rights are human rights.	1
ClaimBuster	23352				Along with this, I think we need something else that has been allowed to deteriorate.	0
ClaimBuster	23353				When they sell into us, there's no tax.	1
ClaimBuster	23354				I want it to be clearer.	0
ClaimBuster	23355				And we have a vacancy.	1
ClaimBuster	23356				And I will succeed for those troops, now that we're there.	0
ClaimBuster	23357				"Now when Senator Green, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to the President, he received back on the second of October, 1958 - ""neither you nor any other American need feel the U.S. will be involved in military hostilities merely in the defense of Quemoy and Matsu."""	1
ClaimBuster	23358				Those are the kind of judges I will appoint.	0
ClaimBuster	23359				It's been a good instinct.	0
ClaimBuster	23360				I don't think it's a fair price to pay to destroy precious parts of America's environment.	0
ClaimBuster	23361				All our Arab allies out there thought we ought to do just exactly that.	0
ClaimBuster	23362				Now General Petraeus has praised the successes, but he said those successes are fragile and if we set a specific date for withdrawal -- and by the way, Senator Obama's original plan, they would have been out last spring before the surge ever had a chance to succeed.	1
ClaimBuster	23363				If you take a trillion dollars out of that Social Security Trust Fund, how are the checks going to be -- how are you going to keep faith with the seniors?	0
ClaimBuster	23364				Most people that are lobbying are lobbying the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	23365				What's in the best interests of our people?	0
ClaimBuster	23366				It isn't the few people who live on them - they are not too important.	0
ClaimBuster	23367				And so I think you take a look at it.	0
ClaimBuster	23368				I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	23369				Secondly, whether or not the mission was clear.	0
ClaimBuster	23370				Now they have the bombs and we're less safe.	1
ClaimBuster	23371				I don't fault the President or the vice president for sending their children to private schools or better schools.	0
ClaimBuster	23372				This ultimate terrorist threat is the most fearsome of all, and it's part of a pattern where our country must stand firm to control terrorism of all kinds.	0
ClaimBuster	23373				Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about.	1
ClaimBuster	23374				I accompanied James Lee Witt down to Texas when those fires broke out.	1
ClaimBuster	23375				And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially.	0
ClaimBuster	23376				Appreciate the chance to have a good, honest dialogue about our differences of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	23377				In California - I'm surprised Governor Reagan brought this up - he had the three largest tax increases in the history of that state under his administration.	1
ClaimBuster	23378				What Senator McCain refers to is a measure in the Senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	23379				Now, they're the 2 folks involved so maybe if you put them together, they did it.	0
ClaimBuster	23380				I believe that the question oversimplifies the difficulties of what we must do in Central America.	0
ClaimBuster	23381				Governor Romney not only opposed it, he suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.	1
ClaimBuster	23382				And it was because they did not think through how power should be exercised, did not have the American public with them on a plan that worked, that we ended up the way we did.	0
ClaimBuster	23383				Well, actually Governor, that isn't what your plan does.	0
ClaimBuster	23384				You ask when do you decide to deploy them.	0
ClaimBuster	23385				I'll tell you how it's affected me.	0
ClaimBuster	23386				Yes, we're going to have a strong and credible and effective nuclear deterrent.	0
ClaimBuster	23387				I wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community where everybody has a role to play.	0
ClaimBuster	23388				But there's got to be priorities, and Middle East is a priority for a lot of reasons, as is Europe and the Far East, our own hemisphere.	0
ClaimBuster	23389				Testing should be confidential, but we have to have a knowledge.	0
ClaimBuster	23390				And what we've seen over the last four years is something I don't want to see over the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	23391				We've got a long tradition of hunting and sportsmen and people who want to make sure they can protect themselves.	1
ClaimBuster	23392				Tipper and I have worked on the problem of violence in entertainment aimed at children.	1
ClaimBuster	23393				But the challenge is to know when the United States of American can beneficially effect the outcome of a crisis, when to go in and when not, when American military power is worth the expenditure of our most precious treasure.	0
ClaimBuster	23394				If a Negro baby is born - and this is true also of Puerto Ricans and Mexicans in some of our cities - he has about one-half as much chance to get through high school as a white baby.	1
ClaimBuster	23395				You can't solve a problem unless you diagnose it.	0
ClaimBuster	23396				It's not working for the American family.	0
ClaimBuster	23397				And I've -- and we've always said that that's not appropriate.	0
ClaimBuster	23398				We do not help it.	0
ClaimBuster	23399				I think we can bring it down by 50% in 4 years and grow the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	23400				I'd like the American people to know that I have worked very hard to be on their side.	0
ClaimBuster	23401				But I can't foresee all the things that will happen, and I don't think a president should be judged solely on the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	23402				You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund.	1
ClaimBuster	23403				But why not do what I have offered to do and asked the Soviet Union to do?	0
ClaimBuster	23404				I said that his tax cut plan, for example, raises the question of whether it's the right choice for the country.	0
ClaimBuster	23405				Second, we have to face that in this world, economic security is a whole lot of national security.	0
ClaimBuster	23406				And I don't think they would have supported the uh - bill had they known that they would lose a hundred and forty thousand jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	23407				In addition, the jobs would not be available right now.	1
ClaimBuster	23408				We're not going to follow that path while I'm -- when I'm president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	23409				A minute ago the President quoted Cicero, I believe.	1
ClaimBuster	23410				In other words, if you're a mom and you're pregnant and you get killed, the murderer gets tried for two cases, not just one.	1
ClaimBuster	23411				I think -- I think -- I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate.	0
ClaimBuster	23412				In addition, Republican Congress cut $53 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	23413				I'd say, Bob, I've got policies to continue to grow our economy and create the jobs of the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	23414				Well we need, for example, economic assistance; we need technical assistance; we need exchange; we need programs of diplomatic and other character which will be effective in that area.	0
ClaimBuster	23415				That's why we have to move forward and not go back.	0
ClaimBuster	23416				Free nations will help us achieve the peace we all want.	0
ClaimBuster	23417				If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country.	0
ClaimBuster	23418				But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said...	1
ClaimBuster	23419				I hope it will not be necessary for any power to resume uh - testing in the atmosphere.	0
ClaimBuster	23420				These have been priorities of mine since I got to the Senate, and it is absolutely critical that we develop a high fuel efficient car that's built not in Japan and not in South Korea, but built here in the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	23421				I don't want my ten year old grandchild to go into an X-rated movie.	0
ClaimBuster	23422				And that's what I would say to that person.	0
ClaimBuster	23423				Well, I don't believe in command and control out of Washington, D.C.	0
ClaimBuster	23424				Knowing what the size of the deficit was, knowing there was no plan to control health care costs and knowing that we did not have a strategy to get real economic growth back into this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	23425				Do you really think that our armed forces are really acceptably strong in those areas of conventional capability where they should be?	0
ClaimBuster	23426				And I don't think that that should be a part of political dialog.	0
ClaimBuster	23427				This requires a person who understands what our -- the limits of our capability are.	0
ClaimBuster	23428				That's why they're fighting so vociferously.	0
ClaimBuster	23429				Let me tell you something.	0
ClaimBuster	23430				And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants.	1
ClaimBuster	23431				A supporter of Senator Obama's is Warren Buffett.	1
ClaimBuster	23432				I just had a word of clarification because of something Governor Clinton said.	0
ClaimBuster	23433				We're 9 million jobs short of that.	1
ClaimBuster	23434				First, we have to learn from the past, because we cannot afford to make the mistakes of the past.	0
ClaimBuster	23435				And I think then you're going to see that people are put out of work.	0
ClaimBuster	23436				Permit the president to set the priorities on where we do the spending.	0
ClaimBuster	23437				That's the only way we got him back.	0
ClaimBuster	23438				You've got to say what you're for and you've got to --	0
ClaimBuster	23439				I think that in dealing with the Soviet Union one has to be realistic.	0
ClaimBuster	23440				I believe that any law- abiding, tax-paying citizen who shows up in the morning and doesn't break the law and doesn't interfere with his or her neighbors ought to have the ability to work in our country and shouldn't be subject to unfair discrimination.	0
ClaimBuster	23441				He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	23442				For me, this is about jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	23443				And secondly, I repeat to you --	0
ClaimBuster	23444				But what we can't do is to simply suggest that, as Governor Romney at times has suggested, that giving heavy weapons, for example, to the Syrian opposition is a simple proposition that would lead us to be safer over the long term.	1
ClaimBuster	23445				But that's not what you've done in the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	23446				Now the oil industry recently has had hard times.	0
ClaimBuster	23447				I will bring -- excuse me.	0
ClaimBuster	23448				We have believed in partnership, and that was an example of a partnership between, not only local government and the Federal Government but also between the private sector that built that particular structure.	0
ClaimBuster	23449				Let me also note that the greatest threat that the world faces, the greatest national security threat is a nuclear Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	23450				Both I and all my predecessors have had a deep commitment to controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	23451				The answer was we got...	0
ClaimBuster	23452				there must by K-2 diagnostic teaching tools, teacher training money, available.	0
ClaimBuster	23453				If you believe that the California economy was better in 1992 than it is today, you should vote for Bob Dole.	1
ClaimBuster	23454				We have uh - just advocated uh - this past week a consolidation of the responsibilities for energy.	1
ClaimBuster	23455				Well, everybody's nibbling around the edges.	0
ClaimBuster	23456				I want to make sure our take-home pay turns around and starts to grow.	0
ClaimBuster	23457				The trick is to expand our export base and to expand trade on terms that are fair to us.	0
ClaimBuster	23458				A commitment to grow the economy while protecting the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	23459				And local school districts end up having more of a burden, a bunch of unfunded mandates, the same kind of thing that happened with special education where we did the right thing by saying every school should provide education to kids with special needs, but we never followed through on the promise of funding, and that left local school districts very cash-strapped.	1
ClaimBuster	23460				I think the lesson in Central America, this recent embarrassment in Nicaragua where we are giving instructions for hired assassins, hiring criminals, and the rest -- all of this has strengthened our opponents.	1
ClaimBuster	23461				They're doing it all over America because they have to.	1
ClaimBuster	23462				Maybe that's why he's asked for 860 -- sought and proposed $860 billion worth of new spending and wants to raise people's taxes in a time of incredible challenge and difficulty and heartache for the American families.	1
ClaimBuster	23463				Now, we have tried -- our country has tried to create an Africa crisis response team there, and we've met some resistance.	1
ClaimBuster	23464				Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction.	0
ClaimBuster	23465				I said that wasn't the right thing to do.	1
ClaimBuster	23466				I'll make sure we can reform Medicare and Social Security to preserve them for coming -- coming generations.	0
ClaimBuster	23467				And it's a tremendously successful club.	0
ClaimBuster	23468				That is a fundamental difference that I have with Senator McCain.	0
ClaimBuster	23469				Once the uh - search and analysis procedure had been completed, and once I'm given a list of the five or seven or ten uh - best qualified persons in the country, I would make a selection from among those uh - persons.	0
ClaimBuster	23470				You're almost not old enough to remember this.	0
ClaimBuster	23471				And we are going to have to intervene; there's no doubt about that.	0
ClaimBuster	23472				Well, we can do better than that.	0
ClaimBuster	23473				Then when there were dissidents in the streets of Tehran, a Green Revolution, holding signs saying, is America with us, the president was silent.	1
ClaimBuster	23474				The first half of '84 it's up 81/2 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	23475				And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people.	1
ClaimBuster	23476				That's the way the system works.	0
ClaimBuster	23477				So I'm not exactly sure where the vice president is coming from, but I think one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly American is for us to go around the world saying, √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚Äúwe do it this way, so should you.√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù Now, we trust freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	23478				He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable.	0
ClaimBuster	23479				And they all say to me that we don't want defeat.	0
ClaimBuster	23480				And people all find their ways to express it.	0
ClaimBuster	23481				And their idea was that they knew what was best for the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	23482				My definition -- here's what I can tell the American people: 95 percent of you will get a tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	23483				And we're going lower, in my opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	23484				Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it.	0
ClaimBuster	23485				"So for instance when he says, ""Yours is a $5 trillion cut."""	1
ClaimBuster	23486				My parents came to this country as immigrants.	1
ClaimBuster	23487				Nobody in the world agrees with our policy on Cuba now.	0
ClaimBuster	23488				But you don't have to wonder if it's me talking.	0
ClaimBuster	23489				The government has nothing to do with it.	0
ClaimBuster	23490				As a matter of reality, Fm going to have to because we have had not one but two detailed studies which indicate that there are billions and billions of dollars to be collected that are not being paid these are not taxes owed by average Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	23491				Well, first of all, Jim, I would like to respond to what the governor just said.	0
ClaimBuster	23492				I love my grandchildren --	0
ClaimBuster	23493				But because Arab nations and the Israelis trust the United States, we were able to take the lead in the Sinai II Agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	23494				I just want to make sure that --	0
ClaimBuster	23495				I just want to make sure the return is good.	0
ClaimBuster	23496				And I think now that trust is being violated and it seems to me we ought to face up to it, and the president ought to say tonight that he's not going to pardon anybody that he was involved in business with who might implicate him later on.	0
ClaimBuster	23497				And you can take it out on charts, you look at all the studies the different groups have done, you go out 4, 5, 6 years, we're still drifting along with a huge deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	23498				It's a haven for drug smugglers and we don't have a firm policy when it comes to Fidel Castro.	1
ClaimBuster	23499				I have fought for reform.	1
ClaimBuster	23500				She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever.	0
ClaimBuster	23501				We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.	1
ClaimBuster	23502				The debt and the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	23503				But I thought it would cost a lot -- I think there's a better way to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	23504				And I do resort to prayer.	0
ClaimBuster	23505				We've got this country going in the right direction.	0
ClaimBuster	23506				There is only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom - that that is presented by the international Communist movement.	0
ClaimBuster	23507				And I know what many of them say today, and I know how to bring them back to the table.	0
ClaimBuster	23508				I supported strong action against the tobacco companies to stop the marketing, advertising, and sale of tobacco to young people.	1
ClaimBuster	23509				Now, put together your plans by Christmas, be ready to go when Congress goes, nail these things.	0
ClaimBuster	23510				And for the state to interfere with a Constitutional amendment, and tell a woman that she must carry that pregnancy to term, regardless of her personal belief, that, I think, violates freedom of conscience as much as anything that I can think of.	0
ClaimBuster	23511				It will require some funds, John.	0
ClaimBuster	23512				We have thousands, equivalent of megaton, or million tons, of TNT warheads.	1
ClaimBuster	23513				The only attacks I have made are on people who apparently would break away at that wall from the government side, using the government, using the power of the courts and so forth to hinder that part of the Constitution that says the government shall not only not establish a religion, it shall not inhibit the practice of religion.	1
ClaimBuster	23514				I read his statement the other day.	1
ClaimBuster	23515				That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.	0
ClaimBuster	23516				So I think the tone of this campaign could have been very different.	0
ClaimBuster	23517				He vetoed middle class tax relief this year.	1
ClaimBuster	23518				First of all, what my opponent wants you to forget is that he voted to authorize the use of force and now says it's the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place.	1
ClaimBuster	23519				We're going to have to have a president, however, that doesn't think that somehow the government investing in -- in car companies like Tesla and -- and Fisker, making electric battery cars.	0
ClaimBuster	23520				And I've told everything I know about it.	0
ClaimBuster	23521				He wanted to take them into bankruptcy without providing them any way to stay open.	0
ClaimBuster	23522				We went because there were people who were responsible for 3,000 American deaths.	1
ClaimBuster	23523				So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead.	1
ClaimBuster	23524				I'll catch up with it later.	0
ClaimBuster	23525				Iran continued to sell oil to the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	23526				And I truly respect it.	0
ClaimBuster	23527				And I want to fight for them.	0
ClaimBuster	23528				We're going to pass a million bankruptcies this year for the first time in history.	1
ClaimBuster	23529				If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.	0
ClaimBuster	23530				You've got more money in your pocket as a result of the tax relief we passed and he opposed.	1
ClaimBuster	23531				Well, I don't have any quarrel with that.	0
ClaimBuster	23532				We've been for that for four, five, six years.	1
ClaimBuster	23533				It's important for the success of Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	23534				When we terminated 400,000 desperate, hopeless, defenseless Americans who were on disability -- confused and unable to defend themselves, and just laid them out on the street, as we did for 4 years, I don't think that's what America is all about.	1
ClaimBuster	23535				The president has denied 9.2 million women $3,800 a year, but he doesn't hesitate to fight for $136,000 to a millionaire.	1
ClaimBuster	23536				I love the principle it's founded on.	0
ClaimBuster	23537				He's broken the pay-as-you-go rules.	0
ClaimBuster	23538				Most important good things that happen in America happen in families.	0
ClaimBuster	23539				In Africa we did not.	1
ClaimBuster	23540				And they are the people who ought to go behind bars.	0
ClaimBuster	23541				In addition to that, we just passed a sweeping small business reform that makes it easier for small business people to take out 401 K plans for themselves and employees and much easier for employees to carry it from job to job.	1
ClaimBuster	23542				I also - know that as far as the human beings on this earth are concerned that the nonproliferation of atomic weapons is number one.	0
ClaimBuster	23543				That's why I'm the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out.	1
ClaimBuster	23544				I'm going to keep my word to you.	0
ClaimBuster	23545				Where did you find this?	0
ClaimBuster	23546				But there's going to be a new Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	23547				We've made real progress there.	0
ClaimBuster	23548				The warning signs are real.	0
ClaimBuster	23549				If Iran acquires nuclear weapons, all the other countries will acquire them, too.	0
ClaimBuster	23550				But when I proposed my plan this past Tuesday, he or one of his spokesmen called it socialized medicine.	1
ClaimBuster	23551				I don't want to walk away from them.	0
ClaimBuster	23552				I have no hesitancy in saying so.	0
ClaimBuster	23553				So we've got to deal with that right away.	0
ClaimBuster	23554				I will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations.	0
ClaimBuster	23555				I think we need to have rating systems that are clear.	0
ClaimBuster	23556				That means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil -- 25 percent of the world's oil -- have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with Russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states we've talked about, Iran, Venezuela.	1
ClaimBuster	23557				But we can't be all things to all people in the world, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	23558				There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression.	0
ClaimBuster	23559				My administration started what's called the Proliferation Security Initiative.	1
ClaimBuster	23560				Less regulations if we want jobs here; legal reform if we want jobs here; and we've got to keep taxes low.	0
ClaimBuster	23561				But, if we're talking about how much we think about the working people and so forth, I'm the only fellow who ever ran for this job who was six times President of his own union and still has a lifetime membership in that union.	1
ClaimBuster	23562				Here's what I do: We take over Medicaid children from the states so that every child in America is covered.	0
ClaimBuster	23563				People are all over the country.	1
ClaimBuster	23564				And your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	23565				And we have to also be very cautious in the way we use our military.	0
ClaimBuster	23566				"People grabbed my arms and said, ""Please save my job."""	1
ClaimBuster	23567				Thank you all very much.	0
ClaimBuster	23568				You've got to have a clear vision.	0
ClaimBuster	23569				In 1983 we thought we had a 75 -year fix.	1
ClaimBuster	23570				But when it comes to our national security, I mean what I say.	0
ClaimBuster	23571				There are 168 federal programs that allow quotas.	1
ClaimBuster	23572				I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system.	1
ClaimBuster	23573				There has never been anything like it, and we're going to have a special prosecutor.	0
ClaimBuster	23574				We have seen the barricades that have had to be built around the White House.	1
ClaimBuster	23575				So we don't have the best.	0
ClaimBuster	23576				That conference has met six times.	1
ClaimBuster	23577				Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	23578				And people were able to stay in their homes, and eventually the values of those homes went up, and they actually made money.	1
ClaimBuster	23579				Let's lay down some guidelines so we don't have continuing inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	23580				It's also a curious thing for him to say since right after 1993 he voted to cut the intelligence budget by $7.5 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	23581				We have been wholly indifferent to Latin America until the last few months.	0
ClaimBuster	23582				You see, I don't think the American people are taxed too little.	0
ClaimBuster	23583				That, once again, the printing presses will start to roll; once again we will see the monetization of that debt result in a higher rate of inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	23584				The Taliban came back in, Al Qaida, we then had the situation that required us to conduct the Afghan war.	1
ClaimBuster	23585				And I expect to win.	0
ClaimBuster	23586				If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	23587				The analysis that he's talking about leaves out more than half of the tax cuts that I have proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	23588				And it seems to me that this could be an adjunct, or certainly a great assisting agent in getting that done.	0
ClaimBuster	23589				Let me talk to the workers.	0
ClaimBuster	23590				But what I've also said is, if we're serious about reducing the deficit, if this is genuinely a moral obligation to the next generation, then in addition to some tough spending cuts, we've also got to make sure that the wealthy do a little bit more.	0
ClaimBuster	23591				In fact, just today business organizations like the United States Chamber of Commerce, which generally are pretty supportive of Republicans, said that this would lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system.	1
ClaimBuster	23592				Non-homeland, non-defense discretionary spending was raising at 15 percent a year when I got into office.	1
ClaimBuster	23593				I'm afraid Senator Obama doesn't understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	23594				Mr. Reagan, as you saw tonight -- President Reagan takes the position it will disappear by magic.	0
ClaimBuster	23595				have leased only 2% of the possible.	1
ClaimBuster	23596				Let's have a three-day waiting period, cooling off, so we can have a background check to make sure that criminals and people who really shouldn't have guns don't get them.	0
ClaimBuster	23597				Well, I'd say the first homeless bill in the Senate was the Dole-Byrd Byrd-Dole bill, I can't remember who was in control then.	1
ClaimBuster	23598				The governor has described Medicare as a government HMO.	1
ClaimBuster	23599				We feel that uh - with the programs that I have recommended, the additional $10 billion tax cut, with the moderate increases in the quality-of-life area, we can still have a balanced budget which I will submit to the Congress in January of 1978.	0
ClaimBuster	23600				You've got a $260 billion deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	23601				And I was in the state senate and I was governor and I'm an engineer, a Naval officer, a farmer, a businessman.	1
ClaimBuster	23602				The other point that I would make is this: this downgrading of how much things cost I think many of our people will understand better when they look at what happened when - during the Truman Administration when the government was spending more than it took in - we found savings over a lifetime eaten up by inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	23603				I've supported all the education programs.	1
ClaimBuster	23604				It comes right out of your paycheck.	1
ClaimBuster	23605				If we're a humble nation, but strong, they'll welcome us.	0
ClaimBuster	23606				Contrary to what Senator McCain keeps on saying, I favor nuclear power as one component of our overall energy mix.	1
ClaimBuster	23607				There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.	1
ClaimBuster	23608				And I've said that I'm going to keep this Social Security entitlement, to keep that trust fund sound.	1
ClaimBuster	23609				As far as I'm concerned, this is a campaign about issues.	0
ClaimBuster	23610				And the amount of debt we're adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral.	1
ClaimBuster	23611				I think we will have a continuing responsibility, as the only remaining superpower, to stay involved.	0
ClaimBuster	23612				You and Mr. Mondale have already disagreed about what you had to say about recalling submarine-launched missiles.	1
ClaimBuster	23613				Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans?	0
ClaimBuster	23614				And we can't do that.	0
ClaimBuster	23615				Senator McCain is absolutely right, we cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	23616				They will be protecting the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	23617				Now he can't have it both ways.	0
ClaimBuster	23618				And one way to do it is to get these deadbeat fathers to pay their obligations to these mothers -- that will help strengthen the American family.	0
ClaimBuster	23619				We have to remain vigilant, as I just said.	0
ClaimBuster	23620				Look at the 24 generals and admirals, retired, that have endorsed me, including the deputy commander of Desert Storm.	1
ClaimBuster	23621				Put everybody that's breathing to work.	0
ClaimBuster	23622				But he's promised seniors that their Social Security benefits will not be cut, and he's promised the same trillion dollars to them.	1
ClaimBuster	23623				I've spoken out over and over again against antisemitism and racism, and I think my record as a member of Congress speaks for itself on that.	1
ClaimBuster	23624				So where'd the increase come from?	0
ClaimBuster	23625				So, Social Security has nothing to do with balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	23626				But I am not going to shortchange our troops in harm's way.	0
ClaimBuster	23627				Then the president, in fact, promised them.	1
ClaimBuster	23628				People are going to come in from Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	23629				It's something to build on.	0
ClaimBuster	23630				Fortunately, a democracy took over, but this nation was embarrassed by this current administration's adoption of their policies.	0
ClaimBuster	23631				And if we haven't learned from the negotiating history on that, we'll never learn.	0
ClaimBuster	23632				Now, in 1984 they were told.	1
ClaimBuster	23633				But you heard the president just say to you that we've added money.	1
ClaimBuster	23634				America is great, because America is good.	0
ClaimBuster	23635				So, I feel in that case, as well as in the reorganization of the intelligence agencies, as I've done, we have to do it by executive order.	0
ClaimBuster	23636				In 6 years -- I budget all this in my budget, and in 6 years the college program would cost 8 billion dollars over and above what -- the present student loan program costs 4; you pay 3 billion dollars for busted loans, because we don't have an automatic recovery system, and a billion dollars in bank fees.	1
ClaimBuster	23637				It's about what the 21st century is going to be like for you.	0
ClaimBuster	23638				When I was a young man, I volunteered for the Army.	1
ClaimBuster	23639				She had one of the greatest lines of all lines.	0
ClaimBuster	23640				And let's not raise anybody's taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	23641				Well, Andrea, today we have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads, on land, on air and in the sea.	1
ClaimBuster	23642				Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens.	1
ClaimBuster	23643				And that one doesn't sound good and it's not affordable.	0
ClaimBuster	23644				Maybe you think that makes sense.	0
ClaimBuster	23645				And I've tried to do that in public life, all through it.	1
ClaimBuster	23646				Look, one murder is too many.	0
ClaimBuster	23647				And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that?	0
ClaimBuster	23648				It is tragic that uh - the full transcript of that interview was not released and that there were excerpts, some of the excerpts, taken out of context.	1
ClaimBuster	23649				And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where we're counting slips.	0
ClaimBuster	23650				I've seen what it is like to see a war, to see the burdens of a war, and I don't want to see us make reckless cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	23651				He wanted to give people rights.	0
ClaimBuster	23652				The first two weeks she's got them, some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned.	1
ClaimBuster	23653				Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, the Baltics are free.	1
ClaimBuster	23654				And we're going to have to embrace a culture and an ethic of responsibility, all of us, corporations, the federal government, and individuals out there who may be living beyond their means.	0
ClaimBuster	23655				But it's getting worse by the day.	0
ClaimBuster	23656				We need more troops there.	0
ClaimBuster	23657				His record in the United States Senate does not match his rhetoric.	1
ClaimBuster	23658				I'm not going to do that, because I think the jury is still out on the Soviet experiment.	0
ClaimBuster	23659				More so you than me.	0
ClaimBuster	23660				Thank you for your question.	0
ClaimBuster	23661				I built an unbelievable company.	1
ClaimBuster	23662				They don't happen to be accurate.	0
ClaimBuster	23663				The American people can make up their mind about whether that's a liberal record or a record that's good for America.	0
ClaimBuster	23664				And she worked her way up to become a vice president of a local bank, but she hit the glass ceiling.	1
ClaimBuster	23665				But I do not expect it to come.	0
ClaimBuster	23666				But next door, of course, we have Egypt.	1
ClaimBuster	23667				Of course, we don't have Medicare, but we didn't cut Medicare by $716 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	23668				You know, because of the intelligence coordination that we do with a range of countries, including Israel, we have a sense of when they would get breakout capacity, which means that we would not be able to intervene in time to stop their nuclear program.	1
ClaimBuster	23669				Nobody ever told the American people that we increased spending $1.83 for every dollar of taxes raised.	1
ClaimBuster	23670				I have met with the President when he made the great decisions with regard to Lebanon, Quemoy and Matsu, other matters.	1
ClaimBuster	23671				I voted for IRA tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	23672				You just say: Hey, we don't agree with you.	0
ClaimBuster	23673				Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values?	0
ClaimBuster	23674				And -- and that upset them, but obviously there was a great deal of anger even before that.	0
ClaimBuster	23675				So my plan -- we're going to renegotiate trade deals.	0
ClaimBuster	23676				Then Cuba shot down two of our planes and murdered four people in international air space.	1
ClaimBuster	23677				I should also point out this; once you put the responsibility on the federal government for paying a portion of teachers' salaries, your local communities and your states are not going to meet the responsibility as much as they should.	0
ClaimBuster	23678				Now again, the White House is a bully pulpit.	0
ClaimBuster	23679				No, and they don't have to, providing we have the leadership that we put -- that I'm offering.	0
ClaimBuster	23680				If they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit.	0
ClaimBuster	23681				So I'm not going to take up your time tonight, but let me just say this.	0
ClaimBuster	23682				But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	23683				We cannot lose those jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	23684				And that's why I think we can embody our values by passing a hate crimes law.	0
ClaimBuster	23685				She talks in favor of the rebels.	1
ClaimBuster	23686				However, there were things added in in the House side that we felt made it less of a good bill; as a matter of fact, made it a bad bill.	0
ClaimBuster	23687				Now, Governor Romney's proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military.	1
ClaimBuster	23688				That's why we're moving in the right direction.	0
ClaimBuster	23689				Now, 95 percent of the people in America will receive more money under my plan because they will receive not only their present benefits, which may be taxed, which will be taxed, but then you add $5,000 onto it, except for those people who have the gold-plated Cadillac insurance policies that have to do with cosmetic surgery and transplants and all of those kinds of things.	0
ClaimBuster	23690				And I need the help of everybody across this country to get it passed in a substantial way by the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	23691				He also said Saddam Hussein would have been stronger.	1
ClaimBuster	23692				So if repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse.	0
ClaimBuster	23693				Look, I -- I want to be very clear about what I said.	0
ClaimBuster	23694				That's not what we do.	0
ClaimBuster	23695				Five million people lost their homes.	1
ClaimBuster	23696				But in a nutshell we've got to reform our government or we won't get anything done.	0
ClaimBuster	23697				We've got a big difference there.	0
ClaimBuster	23698				Don't take my word for this.	0
ClaimBuster	23699				And even some in my own party, including my current vice president, had the same critique as you did.	1
ClaimBuster	23700				I don't ask people whether they're Republicans or Democrats.	0
ClaimBuster	23701				And I believe this is a final verdict on the failed economic policies of the last eight years, strongly promoted by President Bush and supported by Senator McCain, that essentially said that we should strip away regulations, consumer protections, let the market run wild, and prosperity would rain down on all of us.	1
ClaimBuster	23702				I know you're into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it's exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you.	1
ClaimBuster	23703				But I know how to get America working again, restore our economy and take care of working Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	23704				Ninety-nine United States senators voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	23705				But I pledge this to you, America: I will do it in the way that Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy and others did, where we build the strongest alliances, where the world joins together, where we have the best intelligence and where we are able, ultimately, to be more safe and secure.	0
ClaimBuster	23706				I am the one who's in the middle on this.	0
ClaimBuster	23707				I never said -- and I defy you to find where I said -- I gave an extensive environmental speech in April, and I said that we ought to have a goal of raising the fuel efficiency standards to 40 miles a gallon.	1
ClaimBuster	23708				I'll have millions of people at my shoulder, shoulder to shoulder with me, and we will see it done work speed -- because it's wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	23709				He, unlike my opponent, is an expert in national defense; helped amend the INF treaty so we got a good, sound treaty, when these people over here were talking about a freeze.	1
ClaimBuster	23710				For comparable states our size, we're signing them up as fast as any other state.	1
ClaimBuster	23711				But Columbine spoke to a larger issue.	0
ClaimBuster	23712				It has, as I said, delayed the actuarial imbalance falling on us for just a few years with that increase in taxes, and I don't believe we can go on increasing the tax, because the problem for the young people today is that they are paying in far more than they can ever expect to get out.	1
ClaimBuster	23713				It cost us billions, a couple billions of dollars, and I'm not so sure democracy is any better off in Haiti than it was before.	1
ClaimBuster	23714				Now, Governor Romney actually wants to expand those tax breaks.	1
ClaimBuster	23715				We have ten and a half million more jobs, a faster job growth rate than under any Republican administration since the 1920s.	1
ClaimBuster	23716				And this is what we've been trying to do, is involve the Federal Government in such partnerships.	0
ClaimBuster	23717				We're the most competitive country in the world now, and then just fight to open those markets and go try to make the sale, and that's what our trade ambassador our commerce secretary and all the other people in our administration are trying to do.	0
ClaimBuster	23718				It won't be painless but we've got to get the job done.	0
ClaimBuster	23719				You know, Mr. Bush has never appointed a judge.	1
ClaimBuster	23720				There may be a way of reaching out to the uninsured, because there are a lot of uninsured people in the country, particularly children, that should be covered.	0
ClaimBuster	23721				And I want to bring to the White House a sense of strength and fiscal responsibility which will build a good strong foundation under which this country, or above which country can move, grow, invest, and build the best America for its people and for our kids and our grandkids.	0
ClaimBuster	23722				It's a good one, though.	0
ClaimBuster	23723				One of them was a father who had been laid off a few months ago and lost his health insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	23724				The platform to which the President refers, in fact, calls for a religious test in the selection of judges.	0
ClaimBuster	23725				We must have a society that's just and fair.	0
ClaimBuster	23726				And you know what happened?	0
ClaimBuster	23727				And if you remember four years ago, we had not only rising unemployment, but a lot of rising cynicism.	1
ClaimBuster	23728				Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology.	1
ClaimBuster	23729				If they want to become a citizen, they can stand in line, too.	0
ClaimBuster	23730				Now, Senator McCain suggests that somehow, you know, I'm green behind the ears and, you know, I'm just spouting off, and he's somber and responsible.	0
ClaimBuster	23731				I don't think that's the role of the president to pick you're right and you're not right.	0
ClaimBuster	23732				I just think trying to be popular, kind of, in the global sense, if it's not in our best interest makes no sense.	0
ClaimBuster	23733				But what she doesn't say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.	1
ClaimBuster	23734				And thank you for agreeing to moderate this debate this evening.	0
ClaimBuster	23735				They will have a conservative bent.	0
ClaimBuster	23736				Well Mr. Edwards, as you probably know, I have consistently answered all questions with regard to who will be in the next cabinet by saying that that is the responsibility of the next president, and it would be inappropriate to make any decisions on that or to announce any prior to the time that I had the right to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	23737				The same way we treated the apartheid diplomats of South Africa.	0
ClaimBuster	23738				And we weren't diagnosing problems.	1
ClaimBuster	23739				I think the American people want to make certain that that dollar is wisely spent.	0
ClaimBuster	23740				I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be.	0
ClaimBuster	23741				She mentions this, which is all fiction, all fictionalized, probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	23742				I'm proud of the fact that violent crime is down in the State of Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	23743				After my trip to South America, I made recommendations that a separate inter-American lending agency be set up which the South American nations would like much better than a lend- than to participate in the lending agencies which treated all the countries of the world the same.	1
ClaimBuster	23744				But it is inappropriate for us, just because there's a problem somewhere around the world, to take the sons and daughters of working people--and make no mistake about it, our all- volunteer armed force is not made up of the sons and daughters of the beautiful people; it's the working folks who send their sons and daughters to war, with a few exceptions.	1
ClaimBuster	23745				I couldn't agree more about going forward, but I certainly don't want to go back to the policies of the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	23746				And a feature that allows parents to automatically check with one click what sites your kids have visited lately.	0
ClaimBuster	23747				He's president so I guess it's a little better deal.	0
ClaimBuster	23748				I know the Cuban state as a police state, and all my life I've worked in a way that demonstrates that.	0
ClaimBuster	23749				Is my time up yet?	0
ClaimBuster	23750				The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul.	1
ClaimBuster	23751				So you cannot compare unemployment, as you sought to, uh - with the present time with the 1950s, because the then administration had people in the military - they were at war, they were fighting overseas, and this administration has reduced the size of the military by a million four hundred thousand.	1
ClaimBuster	23752				This is an area where I've led on in the Senate, working with a Republican ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Dick Lugar, to deal with the proliferation of loose nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	23753				And if we've got math teachers who are able to provide the kind of support that they need for our kids, that's what's going to determine whether or not the new businesses are created here.	0
ClaimBuster	23754				The president decided to give it to the wealthiest Americans in a tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	23755				And I suggest that in a free society owned by the people, the American people ought to know what we told Ambassador Glaspie to tell Saddam Hussein, because we spent a lot of money and risked lives and lost lives in that effort, and did not accomplish most of our objectives.	1
ClaimBuster	23756				I want it to be streamlined.	0
ClaimBuster	23757				A cease-fire, the United States, Russia, and Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	23758				It's not whether we're better off, it's whether they're better off.	0
ClaimBuster	23759				If somebody is coming here to work with a card, it means they're not going to have to sneak across the border.	0
ClaimBuster	23760				And so seniors will have not only a Medicare plan where the poor seniors will have prescription drugs paid for, but there will be a variety of options.	0
ClaimBuster	23761				And, as I say, I don't believe that I could carry on unless I had a belief in a higher authority and a belief that prayers are answered.	0
ClaimBuster	23762				And it's hard to build a consensus.	0
ClaimBuster	23763				That's twice the amount that my predecessor increased VA funding.	1
ClaimBuster	23764				It's for their security as well as ours.	0
ClaimBuster	23765				... but we believed that we could make the country better.	0
ClaimBuster	23766				But that's happening as we sit here today.	0
ClaimBuster	23767				Secondly, as an executive leader.	0
ClaimBuster	23768				And I think that pattern is a dangerous thing to suggest would work for the Oval Office.	0
ClaimBuster	23769				And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off.	0
ClaimBuster	23770				And if they're not, there has to be a consequence.	0
ClaimBuster	23771				I've been an outdoorsman and a sportsman all my life.	1
ClaimBuster	23772				will go out and do the job that we expect of him and do it with the Congress of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	23773				Now, it's very important for our citizens to also know that I don't believe we ought to have amnesty.	0
ClaimBuster	23774				And people in Europe didn't like that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	23775				You mentioned Washington and Lincoln.	1
ClaimBuster	23776				Mr. McGee, I am planning a speech on that subject next week.	0
ClaimBuster	23777				He failed to take on somebody else -- the malpractice suit people, those that bring these lawsuits against -- these frivolous trial lawyers' lawsuits that are running the costs of medical care up 25 to 50 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	23778				There isn't any question but that we must move forward in every possible way to reduce the danger of war; to move toward controlled disarmament; to control tests; but also let's have in mind this: when Senator Kennedy suggests that we haven't been making an effort, he simply doesn't know what he's talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	23779				The math simply doesn't work.	1
ClaimBuster	23780				And that's the way it should be.	0
ClaimBuster	23781				And it's the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody who ran for president.	1
ClaimBuster	23782				Now that we've talked all around the problem about free trade, let's go again to the center of the bull's- eye.	0
ClaimBuster	23783				There is no bigger judgment for a president of the United states than how you take a nation to war.	0
ClaimBuster	23784				But it is a good program.	0
ClaimBuster	23785				Who's been managing this system?	0
ClaimBuster	23786				Well, that's a choice we have to make, isn't it?	0
ClaimBuster	23787				"I remember the headline in the Daily News that said, ""Ford to New York: Drop Dead."""	1
ClaimBuster	23788				Ladies and gentleman, he gave you a speech and told you he'd plan carefully, take every precaution, take our allies with us.	1
ClaimBuster	23789				We need to be disagreeing on ideas, honestly, and talking about the future.	0
ClaimBuster	23790				Not a single young American today is fighting or dying on any foreign battlefield.	1
ClaimBuster	23791				So the worst of all things has happened.	0
ClaimBuster	23792				Those who've come here illegally take their place.	0
ClaimBuster	23793				That is the present American position.	0
ClaimBuster	23794				Secondly, he says that medical liability costs only cause a 1 percent increase.	1
ClaimBuster	23795				I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	23796				No, it's not just campaign rhetoric.	0
ClaimBuster	23797				When I was asked by our government to do the POW project, within a year the Vietnamese had sent people into Canada to make arrangements to have me and my family killed.	1
ClaimBuster	23798				But the people are the ones that determine it.	1
ClaimBuster	23799				They grew up in the Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	23800				I am convinced, having studied health care for a year hard and talking to hundreds and hundreds of people all across America, that you cannot control the cost of Medicare until you control the cost of private health care and public health care, with managed competition, ceiling on cost, and radical reorganization of the insurance markets.	0
ClaimBuster	23801				I left my campaign and suspended it to go back to Washington to make sure that there were additional protections for the taxpayer in the form of good oversight, in the form of taxpayers being the first to be paid back when our economy recovers -- and it will recover -- and a number of other measures.	1
ClaimBuster	23802				And so, those are four ways to help control the costs in health care.	0
ClaimBuster	23803				I was a small oil person for a while in west Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	23804				I want you to be able to get a job.	0
ClaimBuster	23805				Well, Mr. Ford takes the uh - same attitude that the Republicans always take.	0
ClaimBuster	23806				But you won't change the law, because you take in so much money.	0
ClaimBuster	23807				That's an odd thing to say, since we've tripled the homeland security budget from $10 billion to $30 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	23808				Ross says, with great conviction, he opposes the North American Free Trade Agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	23809				They should be judged on their qualifications.	0
ClaimBuster	23810				We did not feel that I could commit.	0
ClaimBuster	23811				Under the 1981 tax bill, people making $200,000 a year got $60,000 in tax relief over 3 years, while people making $30,000 a year, all taxes considered, got no relief at all or their taxes actually went up.	1
ClaimBuster	23812				We're not going to go alone like this president did.	1
ClaimBuster	23813				Well, everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country's interests and our values.	0
ClaimBuster	23814				We were safer before President Bush came to office.	0
ClaimBuster	23815				But the idea of taxing people more, putting more people out of work, you'll never get there.	0
ClaimBuster	23816				But we turned it over to a maniacal fanatic who has slaughtered thousands and thousands of people, calling it executions.	1
ClaimBuster	23817				And we worked it out, and indeed we're moving forward all around the world in a much more peaceful way.	0
ClaimBuster	23818				I could answer a lot of these things tit for tat.	0
ClaimBuster	23819				"Now if the Senator in his answer to this question will say ""I now will depart, or retract my previous views; I think I was wrong in I 955; I think I was wrong in 1959; and I think I was wrong in our television debate to say that we should draw a line leaving out Quemoy and Matsu - draw a line in effect abandoning these islands to the Communists;"" then this will be right out of the campaign because there will be no issue between us."	0
ClaimBuster	23820				Now, let me say, some people say we can't do this but Hawaii does it.	0
ClaimBuster	23821				And we need to do our part.	0
ClaimBuster	23822				I would be very careful about using our troops as nation builders.	0
ClaimBuster	23823				Now with respect to the deficit, the president was handed a $5.6 trillion surplus, ladies and gentlemen.	1
ClaimBuster	23824				It took three and a half years.	1
ClaimBuster	23825				I believe we should have a stronger military force.	0
ClaimBuster	23826				And by the way, they noticed that you skipped Israel.	1
ClaimBuster	23827				Let -- let -- let's...	0
ClaimBuster	23828				Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300.	1
ClaimBuster	23829				In the last week, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I have re-read the testimony of General Twining representing the Administration in 1959, and the Assistant Secretary of State before the Foreign Relations Committee in 1958, and I have accurately described the Administration policy, and I support it wholeheartedly.	1
ClaimBuster	23830				One last point I want to make.	0
ClaimBuster	23831				And Saddam Hussein was a threat, and that we must spread liberty because in the long run, the way to defeat hatred and tyranny and oppression is to spread freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	23832				I'm interested in 240 million points of light.	0
ClaimBuster	23833				That was what he said.	1
ClaimBuster	23834				In the first place, uh - as is the case with the environmental policy and the energy policy that I just described, and the policy for nonproliferation of uh - of nuclear waste, this administration has no urban policy.	1
ClaimBuster	23835				Whenever a majority of the people are for a program, the House and the Senate responds to it.	1
ClaimBuster	23836				In August of 1960, when we tried to get it again, but this time for medical care, we received the support of one Republican in the Senate on this occasion.	1
ClaimBuster	23837				That's why I've called for an investment of $15 billion a year over 10 years.	1
ClaimBuster	23838				I think we need to go back and take a look.	0
ClaimBuster	23839				We will not make war inevitable.	0
ClaimBuster	23840				But you talk about judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	23841				He was asked this on Univision the other day.	1
ClaimBuster	23842				So we did have at that time with good management, the ability to do both.	0
ClaimBuster	23843				They don't want to see the world break out into -- into various forms of chaos, because they have to -- they have to manufacture goods and put people to work and they have about 20,000 -- 20 million, rather, people coming out of the farms every year coming into the cities, needing jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	23844				I feel strongly about it because I don't want it to come out of my time.	0
ClaimBuster	23845				I've talked to them and I've listened.	1
ClaimBuster	23846				I've proven that I can, and for 30 years, I've produced results for people.	0
ClaimBuster	23847				When you make that judgment, you are deciding not only the future of our nation; in a very profound respect, you're deciding the future of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	23848				... because I'm -- I'm so proud of the state that I had the chance to be governor of.	0
ClaimBuster	23849				I said we'd put, pass a crime bill that would put 100,000 police on the street, ban assault weapons, and deal with the problems that ought to be dealt with with capital punishment, including capital punishment for drug kingpins, and we did that.	1
ClaimBuster	23850				And because of the economy's slowing down, I think we can also expect less tax revenue so there's no doubt that as president I'm going to have to make some tough decision.	1
ClaimBuster	23851				I don't believe it will happen.	0
ClaimBuster	23852				Unfortunately, Governor Romney's plan doesn't do it.	0
ClaimBuster	23853				Exxon Mobil, and other oil companies, for example, would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks.	1
ClaimBuster	23854				I understand how hard it is to commit troops.	0
ClaimBuster	23855				We've got to be much more strategic if we're going to be able to deal with all of the challenges that we face out there.	0
ClaimBuster	23856				But I do know this: that if we were to follow that recommendation, that we would lose all of our friends in Latin America, we would probably be condemned in the United Nations, and we would not accomplish our objective.	0
ClaimBuster	23857				You did not say that you would provide government help.	1
ClaimBuster	23858				It's to make sure we raise standards.	0
ClaimBuster	23859				I just think it's wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	23860				We give you broader competition.	0
ClaimBuster	23861				Well no doubt about it, our founding fathers had a great deal of wisdom.	0
ClaimBuster	23862				I will fully research it, go forward as fast as we can.	0
ClaimBuster	23863				There are no magic answers to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	23864				You know, there are some things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	23865				Less dependency upon foreign sources of crude is good for consumers.	1
ClaimBuster	23866				The American Medical, Hospital Association, the Nurses Association, the Catholic Hospital Association all said hundreds of hospitals could close and people would be hurt badly under the Dole-Gingrich Medicare plan that I vetoed.	1
ClaimBuster	23867				Now please, folks, if you don't hear anything else I say, remember where the -- millions of people at work are our tax base.	0
ClaimBuster	23868				We absolutely must, which is why I responded to your first question the way I did.	0
ClaimBuster	23869				But do you realize that over the last ten years that's a higher figure than the average growth during that ten-year period?	1
ClaimBuster	23870				But they are now spending more money on advertising and promotion.	1
ClaimBuster	23871				You and others in this great country have worked hard and done a great deal to give your children and your grandchildren the blessings of a better America.	0
ClaimBuster	23872				And people who are going through them know that there's a job waiting for them if they complete it.	0
ClaimBuster	23873				But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant.	1
ClaimBuster	23874				And yet you take their money.	1
ClaimBuster	23875				He's health for the mother.	0
ClaimBuster	23876				I supported Nunn-Lugar back in the early 1990s when a lot of my colleagues didn't.	1
ClaimBuster	23877				The means are at issue.	0
ClaimBuster	23878				And again, I want to make it possible for all middle-class families to send their kids to college and more Pell grants for those who are in the lower income groups also, and then I want to make sure that we have job training on top of that and lifelong learning, but it all starts with the public school teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	23879				Rudy Giuliani, Mayor of New York, brought crime down 25 percent just in New York City.	1
ClaimBuster	23880				As the vice president is.	0
ClaimBuster	23881				That's what a Chief Executive Officer does.	0
ClaimBuster	23882				Every school and every school district, have every state test the children.	0
ClaimBuster	23883				Now, this has cost us deeply in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	23884				I think it's a good program.	0
ClaimBuster	23885				Senator Obama has asked for nearly $1 billion in pork-barrel earmark projects...	1
ClaimBuster	23886				And now we are back, because we have strengthened the defenses of this country, and believe me, I don't want to see us return to those days.	0
ClaimBuster	23887				And although there was a serious threat to the Social Security System and its integrity during the 1976 campaign and when I became President, the action of the Democratic Congress working with me has been to put Social Security back on a sound financial basis.	1
ClaimBuster	23888				It costs $20-25 billion a year, and I want to see those outrageous claims capped.	1
ClaimBuster	23889				If I lose this election, I will continue in the Senate to try to build a stronger country.	0
ClaimBuster	23890				So this is what our program is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	23891				And if you look at our tax policies, it's a classic example.	1
ClaimBuster	23892				If you don't control the health care costs of the entire system, you cannot get control of it.	0
ClaimBuster	23893				And if I heard the statement day before yesterday, you said you would order -- he said he would order his FDA appointee to review the decision.	1
ClaimBuster	23894				I kept the faith with my family.	0
ClaimBuster	23895				And we didn't touch it.	1
ClaimBuster	23896				I know he wants to disown it.	1
ClaimBuster	23897				That was precisely what I recommended and ultimately what happened.	1
ClaimBuster	23898				My friends, as I said in my opening remarks, these are very difficult times and challenges for America.	0
ClaimBuster	23899				Well, first of all, for the last four years we have worked had to put more and more pressure on the Castro government to bring about more openness and move toward democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	23900				I suggested that we amend our legislation so that we could enjoy closer economic ties.	1
ClaimBuster	23901				Instead of just comes the soft bigotry of low expectations, that there has to be a consequence.	0
ClaimBuster	23902				Personal earnings after taxes per capita have gone up almost $3,000 in these 4 years.	1
ClaimBuster	23903				I'm going to tell you Americans we'll get to work right away and we'll get to work together, and we can get them all done, because that's what America has been doing.	0
ClaimBuster	23904				Lincoln called this country the last best hope of man on earth.	1
ClaimBuster	23905				There was a time when there was hope for those who uh - were poor and downtrodden and who were - uh elderly or who were - uh ill or who were in minority groups, but that time has been gone.	0
ClaimBuster	23906				We're ahead in this competition, as Senator Kennedy, I think, has implied.	0
ClaimBuster	23907				The whole problem came up in 1984.	1
ClaimBuster	23908				And yes, it took me to veto 2 civil rights quota bills because I don't believe in quotas, and I don't think the American people believe in quotas.	1
ClaimBuster	23909				All history tells us that that's a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	23910				I look up and see the Soviet flag on the moon.	0
ClaimBuster	23911				They'll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous.	0
ClaimBuster	23912				I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox.	1
ClaimBuster	23913				We have enough problems in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	23914				I'm not going to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	23915				That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take.	1
ClaimBuster	23916				Thank you, Jim, and Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	23917				And also make sure that when they get out of college, there's a job.	0
ClaimBuster	23918				My grandfather died a while back.	1
ClaimBuster	23919				We've got the plan announced for what we can do for small business.	1
ClaimBuster	23920				No preferences to unqualified people, no quotas, but don't give up on making an extra effort until you're sure everybody has a chance to prove they're qualified.	0
ClaimBuster	23921				I don't want to cost jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	23922				Our schools are getting better, and our schools can be made to be even better still with the right kind of community leadership and partnership at the school level.	0
ClaimBuster	23923				He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes, federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, state property tax, gasoline tax.	1
ClaimBuster	23924				This is a serious threat to security in the world, and I believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	23925				That's what brings jobs in.	0
ClaimBuster	23926				And we're on the track on this one.	0
ClaimBuster	23927				But it is certainly my responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	23928				Middle-class people will have their fair share of changing to do, and many challenges to face, including the challenge of becoming constantly re-educated.	0
ClaimBuster	23929				I put my wallet on the table for you and your children.	1
ClaimBuster	23930				Your home mortgage interest deduction, charity, child tax credit, and so forth, you can use those as part of filling that bucket, if you will, of deductions.	0
ClaimBuster	23931				We ought to protect the American flag with a constitutional amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	23932				Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can -- name -- you almost can't name a good deal.	1
ClaimBuster	23933				Not only ships couldn't, but I'd say companies that are moving their oil can't, people who are trading in their oil can't.	0
ClaimBuster	23934				We've got to proceed very carefully on that.	0
ClaimBuster	23935				It's called premium support, but it's understood to be a voucher program.	1
ClaimBuster	23936				Now the United States, in this case, this administration, has recommended a year ago and we have reiterated it again this year, that the United States, South Korea, North Korea and the uh - People's Republic of China sit down at a conference table to resolve the problems of the Korean peninsula.	1
ClaimBuster	23937				I think there need to be reforms in the IMF.	0
ClaimBuster	23938				You can look at our tax returns.	0
ClaimBuster	23939				It has to have accountability and oversight.	0
ClaimBuster	23940				This country desperately needs a jobs program, and my first priority would be to pass a jobs program, to introduce it on the first day I was inaugurated.	0
ClaimBuster	23941				He was criticizing President Reagan.	1
ClaimBuster	23942				I will grant you that interest rates were too high in 1980, and we can have another debate as to why -- energy prices and so on.	0
ClaimBuster	23943				But there seems to be a lot of preoccupation on -- not certainly only in this debate, but just in general on law.	0
ClaimBuster	23944				The Lewin report is a group of folks who are not politically affiliated.	1
ClaimBuster	23945				I will never cede the authority of our country or our security to any other nation.	0
ClaimBuster	23946				I'm glad you clarified that.	0
ClaimBuster	23947				But our goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the U.N. resolutions that have been in place.	0
ClaimBuster	23948				Now, the President spoke a moment ago about that I was against the minimum wage.	1
ClaimBuster	23949				Now I would be willing to go ahead with negotiations.	0
ClaimBuster	23950				So this comes from the people.	0
ClaimBuster	23951				We will have to have people play on a fair basis, that's number one.	0
ClaimBuster	23952				I respect his right to disagree with me.	0
ClaimBuster	23953				The cornerstone is to have strong accountability in return for money and in return for flexibility.	0
ClaimBuster	23954				That's why I proposed a hydrogen automobile -- hydrogen-generated automobile.	1
ClaimBuster	23955				Seven out of eight years, the budget commitments for defense went down, 37% in all.	1
ClaimBuster	23956				Intensive reading laboratories, teacher retraining.	0
ClaimBuster	23957				Our airports are like from a third world country.	0
ClaimBuster	23958				We need to have rewards.	0
ClaimBuster	23959				The president also took Medicare, which belongs to you.	1
ClaimBuster	23960				Number two, keep working with the states, as we are now, to add 2.2 million more people to the insurance system.	0
ClaimBuster	23961				Let me talk about tax relief.	0
ClaimBuster	23962				Going back 23 years, I don't know, Helen.	0
ClaimBuster	23963				The Lewin report accurately noted that there are going to be 20 million people, over 20 million people added to government-controlled health care.	1
ClaimBuster	23964				Will we have a world of hunger and - and hatred, and will we be living in an armed camp stripped of our friendship and allies hiding behind a tight defense that's been drawn in around us because we are fearful of the outside world?	0
ClaimBuster	23965				I think it's very important to keep the debt going down and completely eliminate it.	0
ClaimBuster	23966				"As George Will said the other day, ""Freedom on the march; not in Russia right now."""	1
ClaimBuster	23967				Of course, I've talked to people like Joe the plumber and tell him that I'm not going to spread his wealth around.	1
ClaimBuster	23968				Now, that is not the judgment that a president of the United States ought to make.	0
ClaimBuster	23969				Seventy-two other nations have been able to do it.	1
ClaimBuster	23970				We've got to pay it back.	0
ClaimBuster	23971				Who would write the prayer?	0
ClaimBuster	23972				We should have more debates.	0
ClaimBuster	23973				The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together.	1
ClaimBuster	23974				It is actuarially out of balance, and this first became evident about 16 years ago, and some of us were voicing warnings then.	1
ClaimBuster	23975				So, I can only tell you about the manual -- that we're not in the habit of assigning guilt before there has been proper evidence produced and proof of that guilt.	0
ClaimBuster	23976				And he has made the point that you have not repudiated some of the semidiplomatic activity of the Reverend Jackson, particularly in Central America.	1
ClaimBuster	23977				Saddam Hussein still is a threat in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	23978				We've got to get costs down, increase value, emphasize wellness.	0
ClaimBuster	23979				It's kind of like a political issue as opposed to a people issue.	0
ClaimBuster	23980				I want to help those with disabilities fit into the mainstream.	0
ClaimBuster	23981				Let me tell you why.	0
ClaimBuster	23982				"He went after John McCain, a prisoner of war, said he prefers ""people who aren't captured."""	1
ClaimBuster	23983				But we shouldn't have been there in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	23984				Another way you can do is to expand Medicaid.	0
ClaimBuster	23985				I grant you that prices may go up, because as you go further and have to go deeper, you are adding to the cost of production.	0
ClaimBuster	23986				If you allow -- also allow -- convince states to -- allow states to allow the mother to match some of the children's health insurance money with it, the pool purchasing power.	0
ClaimBuster	23987				A President must manage that budget.	0
ClaimBuster	23988				And it has got to be brought under control.	0
ClaimBuster	23989				Because new breakthroughs in atomic energy technology there's some indications that by the time the next president's term of office has come to an end, there may be ten, fifteen, or twenty countries with an atomic capacity, perhaps that many testing bombs with all the effect that it could have on the atmosphere and with all the chances that more and more countries will have an atomic capacity, with more and more chance of war.	0
ClaimBuster	23990				We haven't seen the language yet.	1
ClaimBuster	23991				Now, I say whose country is this?	0
ClaimBuster	23992				And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have.	1
ClaimBuster	23993				States like Florida, Colorado, Virginia, and other states.	0
ClaimBuster	23994				I'm going to give them $5,000 to take with them wherever they want to go, and this will give them affordability.	0
ClaimBuster	23995				But I am committed to the one at Portsmouth, Ohio.	0
ClaimBuster	23996				I would take eh - the strongest possible measures short of uh - actual military uh - action there by our own troops, but I doubt that that would be an eventuality.	0
ClaimBuster	23997				If we don't resolve that issue, all others become irrelevant.	0
ClaimBuster	23998				Number one, under my program we would provide matching funds to states to teach everybody with a job to read in the next 5 years and give everybody with a job the chance to get a high school diploma, in big places on the job.	0
ClaimBuster	23999				I think of the man who grabbed me by the shoulder once with tears in his eyes and said his daughter was dying of cancer and he thanked me for giving him a chance to spend some time with her without losing his job because of the Family and Medical Leave Act.	1
ClaimBuster	24000				When -- when he was asked would class size...	0
ClaimBuster	24001				And that launched a campaign to try to get the record companies to put ratings that -- warning labels for parents.	1
ClaimBuster	24002				Just the ground rules here.	0
ClaimBuster	24003				When you came to office, just over $10 trillion in debt, now $16 trillion in debt.	1
ClaimBuster	24004				Then when we had the assault weapons ban in the Senate, Senator Dole fought it bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost brought the entire crime bill down because the National Rifle Association didn't want the assault weapons ban, just like they didn't want the Brady Bill.	1
ClaimBuster	24005				And I think I did a good job.	0
ClaimBuster	24006				I have been talking to a number of Congressmen who have much the same idea that I have, and that is that in the inner city areas, that in cooperation with the local government and the national Government, and using tax incentives and with cooperating with the private sector, that we have development zones.	0
ClaimBuster	24007				He's said that it's been a policy that has led to defeat and retreat.	1
ClaimBuster	24008				And that is, I want to give middle-class families and folks who are striving to get into the middle-class some relief.	0
ClaimBuster	24009				The facts are after my plan, the wealthiest of Americans pay more taxes of the percentage of the whole than they do today.	1
ClaimBuster	24010				Libya is now peacefully dismantling its weapons programs.	1
ClaimBuster	24011				There are 43 million of us.	1
ClaimBuster	24012				And that's been lacking in the last eight years.	0
ClaimBuster	24013				It's been tried for 12 years and it's failed.	1
ClaimBuster	24014				And I only want to say that however good the record is, it's got to be better.	0
ClaimBuster	24015				I believe that our power and prestige in the last eight years has declined.	0
ClaimBuster	24016				And there's one going on right now, which we don't know about it.	1
ClaimBuster	24017				It's a $500 per child tax credit.	1
ClaimBuster	24018				Now, can't somebody agree with me that the government is breaking business's legs with these trade agreements?	0
ClaimBuster	24019				I fought for, and the Congress finally went along with a general revenue sharing program, whereby cities and uh - states, uh - the cities two-thirds and the states one-third, get over six billion dollars a year in cash through which they can uh - provide many, many services, whatever they really want.	1
ClaimBuster	24020				But those are not the things that count.	0
ClaimBuster	24021				We -- we had to go into Pakistan.	0
ClaimBuster	24022				Over the last ten years since he's been governor, they're 30% behind, 30% -- they're 30% of the national average.	1
ClaimBuster	24023				So let's talk about this.	0
ClaimBuster	24024				Savings accounts are losing money instead of gaining money.	1
ClaimBuster	24025				I had hoped this had been a little friendlier evening.	0
ClaimBuster	24026				In the past, those minority groups have often been excluded from participation in the affairs of government.	1
ClaimBuster	24027				Some of them have been Democrats and some of them have been Republicans.	1
ClaimBuster	24028				There are other ways to make sure drugs are cheaper.	0
ClaimBuster	24029				As a result of securing ourselves and ridding the Taliban out of Afghanistan, the Afghan people had elections this weekend.	1
ClaimBuster	24030				So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory.	1
ClaimBuster	24031				And we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region, you know, the Estonians, the Lithuanians, the Latvians, the Poles, the Czechs, that we are, in fact, going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts.	0
ClaimBuster	24032				Well first may I correct a statement which was made before, that under my agricultural program food prices would go up twenty-five percent.	0
ClaimBuster	24033				I came to Washington to solve problems.	1
ClaimBuster	24034				Not reducing the interest -	0
ClaimBuster	24035				And you know, there were some of us that stood up two years ago and said we've got to enact legislation to fix this.	1
ClaimBuster	24036				It is being blocked by the Republican leadership in the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	24037				How can we help people as we are to get their retirements when they work for small businesses, to be able to afford health insurance, to be able to educate their children.	0
ClaimBuster	24038				Yes, and I'll apply it to Congress too.	0
ClaimBuster	24039				The president also unfortunately gave in to the chemical industry, which didn't want to do some of the things necessary to strengthen our chemical plant exposure.	1
ClaimBuster	24040				But if you just want to keep the music going, just stay traditional this next time around, and 4 years from now you'll have everybody blaming everybody else for a bad health care system.	0
ClaimBuster	24041				The Ford administration wants to eradicate hunger and disease in our underdeveloped countries throughout the world.	0
ClaimBuster	24042				And I'm only here to tell you that I believe with all my heart that our first priority must be world peace, and that use of force is always and only a last resort, when everything else has failed, and then only with regard to our national security.	0
ClaimBuster	24043				But I said they have to focus on terror, also.	1
ClaimBuster	24044				Number two, we're going to increase our trade.	0
ClaimBuster	24045				For a long time our American citizens have been excluded, sometimes misled, sometimes have been lied to.	0
ClaimBuster	24046				Look at Sarah Brady, Jim Brady's wife, President Reagan's press secretary, who endorsed me because he knuckled under to the NRA and wouldn't fight for the Brady Bill.	1
ClaimBuster	24047				I have to say that Governor Romney criticized me for being too tough in that tire case; said this wouldn't be good for American workers and that it would be protectionist.	1
ClaimBuster	24048				In the communities which have had real success putting police officers near schools where kids carry weapons, to get the weapons out of the schools, are on the same blocks, you've seen crime go down.	1
ClaimBuster	24049				I believe everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief.	0
ClaimBuster	24050				And it's Katherine Fenton, who has a question for you.	0
ClaimBuster	24051				We ought to put the homeowners first.	0
ClaimBuster	24052				Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now?	0
ClaimBuster	24053				I think those are very very serious questions of judgment, which those of you who are watching us here tonight have a right to judge and review.	0
ClaimBuster	24054				So we're already beginning to see progress.	1
ClaimBuster	24055				We passed landmark legislation in '84.	1
ClaimBuster	24056				And, with faith in God and with conviction in the mission of America, I believe that we can reach higher.	0
ClaimBuster	24057				It averaged about 18% in the first quarter of this year.	1
ClaimBuster	24058				This sounds like real progress here, because we've had a big difference on the safe use of nuclear power for our energy base.	0
ClaimBuster	24059				We haven't done that yet.	0
ClaimBuster	24060				Look at the misery index when the Democrats had both the White House and the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	24061				I'm just telling you our state comes together to do what is right.	0
ClaimBuster	24062				I just have to correct the record.	0
ClaimBuster	24063				That we must cut back.	0
ClaimBuster	24064				The ideals and the values of the United States inspired the entire world.	0
ClaimBuster	24065				What I downgrade, Mr. Nixon, is the leadership the country is getting, not the country.	0
ClaimBuster	24066				It's causing high interest rates.	0
ClaimBuster	24067				And I -- and to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	24068				That's what's wrong with Mr. Bush.	0
ClaimBuster	24069				Now, I have set as strong an example as I can, then at that point when we sit down over at Capitol Hill -- tomorrow night I'm going to be talking about government reform -- it's a long subject, you wouldn't let me finish tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	24070				Incidentally, just this past week, the crown jewel in that program that he had devised was stolen, I guess, because a conference committee turned down the ambitious plan that he had to increase the amount of money that would be available to the Economic Development Administration for loan guarantees and direct loans and credits.	1
ClaimBuster	24071				And when I stood up there and spoke to the Congress, I was speaking off the same intelligence he looked at to make his decisions to support the authorization of force.	1
ClaimBuster	24072				I think the economy has meant more for the Gore and Clinton folks than the Gore and Clinton folks have meant for the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	24073				I once said, in a frivolous moment, when he got out of the race: If you can't stand the heat, buy an air conditioning company.	1
ClaimBuster	24074				Maybe you put off buying a new car.	0
ClaimBuster	24075				What I object to here is the constant reference to surrendering these islands.	0
ClaimBuster	24076				He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood.	1
ClaimBuster	24077				I've got reply on that.	0
ClaimBuster	24078				Take it out of politics.	0
ClaimBuster	24079				But it won't be possible to do, if his tax scheme passes because even his own campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says he'll have to cut Medicare even more than was cut in the bill that I vetoed.	1
ClaimBuster	24080				Of course the greatest threat of all is Iran, four years closer to a nuclear weapon.	0
ClaimBuster	24081				Who has the perseverance, the character, the integrity, the maturity, to get the job done?	0
ClaimBuster	24082				I want to bring the rates down, at the same time lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth, so we keep getting the revenue we need.	0
ClaimBuster	24083				But I want to remind you, the number of uninsured in America during their watch has increased.	1
ClaimBuster	24084				If I had it to do over again I might answer the questions a little better.	0
ClaimBuster	24085				Mr. Kalb, I think what has been hailed as something I'm supposedly, as President, discussing as principle is the recall of just some philosophical discussions with people who are interested in the same things; and that is the prophecies down through the years, the biblical prophecies of what would portend the coming of Armageddon, and so forth, and the fact that a number of theologians for the last decade or more have believed that this was true, that the prophecies are coming together that portend that.	0
ClaimBuster	24086				Now, I think that it's very important to understand that cutting benefits under Social Security means that people like Winifred Skinner from Des Moines, Iowa, who is here, would really have a much harder time.	0
ClaimBuster	24087				And we have to be very vigilant.	0
ClaimBuster	24088				I say that because I think, this year, we will send $90 billion out of this country to pay for imported oil, even though that.	0
ClaimBuster	24089				Why isn't she funding, not for $100 million, but why don't you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?	0
ClaimBuster	24090				This will cost some money on the front end, but over the long term this is the only way that not only are we going to make families healthy, but it's also how we're going to save the federal budget, because we can't afford these escalating costs.	0
ClaimBuster	24091				It's one way to help reduce abortions.	0
ClaimBuster	24092				I'd like to know, Anderson, why aren't you bringing up the e-mails?	0
ClaimBuster	24093				The people deserve that since we have to pick up the tab; you got the PAC money, we'll pay the tab.	0
ClaimBuster	24094				If my daughter or yours looks to somebody like they're not a citizen, I don't want -- I don't want to empower somebody like that.	0
ClaimBuster	24095				I would have someone ride herd on those regulations, and we would start eliminating those discriminations in the Federal Government against women.	0
ClaimBuster	24096				There are six countries in Africa that are members of the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	24097				It's a contract between generations.	0
ClaimBuster	24098				These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	24099				He was deceiving the inspectors.	1
ClaimBuster	24100				Well, it would be if they're given special protective status.	0
ClaimBuster	24101				They have to help us out.	0
ClaimBuster	24102				Very interesting why she's leaving carried interest.	0
ClaimBuster	24103				I think -- you know, I'm starting to understand it.	0
ClaimBuster	24104				I disagree, strongly disagree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	24105				And I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors -- Republican and Democrats -- said, please let us do that.	1
ClaimBuster	24106				And NAFTA doesn't have -- did not have enforceable labor agreements and environmental agreements.	1
ClaimBuster	24107				By 1980 that same person was $500 below the poverty line.	1
ClaimBuster	24108				And to establish a permanent home heating oil reserve here in the northeast.	1
ClaimBuster	24109				I also had a program starting last year.	1
ClaimBuster	24110				We've made some progress during the last eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	24111				And he's kept his head up.	0
ClaimBuster	24112				And thank you for tuning in this evening.	0
ClaimBuster	24113				And ever since that time, I've tried to give something back to my country, to the people who are watching us tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	24114				I'm not interested in his character.	0
ClaimBuster	24115				I think you have to take on medical fraud.	0
ClaimBuster	24116				And then make sure they have the arms necessary to defend themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	24117				I've met them in Appleton, Wisconsin.	1
ClaimBuster	24118				First of all, the world is still a dangerous and uncertain place.	0
ClaimBuster	24119				I'm concerned that we're overdeployed around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	24120				In the Truman Administration, six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain including the satellite countries of Eastern Europe and Communist China.	1
ClaimBuster	24121				Yes, I think the next president of the United States should make one last effort to secure an agreement on the cessation of tests, number one.	0
ClaimBuster	24122				That there is some resentment of U.S. power.	0
ClaimBuster	24123				The President told the terrorists he was going to retaliate.	1
ClaimBuster	24124				We've piled up over a trillion dollars in debt and the next president of the United States is going to have to make some choices.	1
ClaimBuster	24125				We set up a simple structure of government that could be administrated fairly and it was a - a tremendous success.	0
ClaimBuster	24126				We don't have to settle for unemployment at a chronically high level.	0
ClaimBuster	24127				In Lebanon, I stood up to President Reagan, my hero, and said, if we send Marines in there, how can we possibly beneficially affect this situation?	1
ClaimBuster	24128				Mr. Ford is a good and decent man, but he's in - been in office now more than eight hundred days approaching almost as long as John Kennedy was in office.	1
ClaimBuster	24129				If you don't like what I did, you should have changed the laws.	0
ClaimBuster	24130				Neighborhoods are safer when we crack down on people who commit crimes with guns.	0
ClaimBuster	24131				Now, I don't think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it just doesn't work out that way.	0
ClaimBuster	24132				When he gave you that biggest tax increase in history; when he tried to take over your healthcare system.	1
ClaimBuster	24133				We've got to recruit 100,000 new teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	24134				And it's true on this and it's true on CAFE.	1
ClaimBuster	24135				I suggest that people go up on the Web site of Citizens Against Government Waste, and they'll look at those projects.	0
ClaimBuster	24136				But look, I also think we ought to give a little credit to the President of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	24137				It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented.	0
ClaimBuster	24138				But no one knows whether Armageddon, those prophecies mean that Armageddon is a thousand years away or day after tomorrow.	0
ClaimBuster	24139				And they can say that the President of the United States and the United States of America has stood on the right side of history.	0
ClaimBuster	24140				Her name is Alicia Machado.	1
ClaimBuster	24141				This president thought it was more important to give the wealthiest people in America a tax cut rather than invest in homeland security.	1
ClaimBuster	24142				To me that means we have to go on and balance this budget while we protect Medicare and Medicaid and education and the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	24143				Mr. President, countries are leaving the coalition, not joining.	1
ClaimBuster	24144				And we need to fix a lot of the problems.	0
ClaimBuster	24145				I think that by speaking clearly and doing what we say and not sending mixed messages, it is less likely we'll ever have to use troops.	0
ClaimBuster	24146				And he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation from the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy.	1
ClaimBuster	24147				So I want to make sure that we make -- we make America more competitive.	0
ClaimBuster	24148				But when Governor Romney says that he has a very different economic plan, the centerpiece of his economic plan are tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	24149				If I can get you to defend me and I can spend all my money building industry that's a home run for me.	0
ClaimBuster	24150				Now you tell me who stands on the side of the fence.	0
ClaimBuster	24151				And private insurers have to make a profit.	0
ClaimBuster	24152				And I'd be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six- foot portrait of Donald.	1
ClaimBuster	24153				And therefore I want to rebuild the military power.	0
ClaimBuster	24154				In spite of his policies.	0
ClaimBuster	24155				Got four more years, I've got more to do to continue to raise standards, to continue to reward teachers and school districts that are working, to emphasize math and science in the classrooms, to continue to expand Pell Grants to make sure that people have an opportunity to start their career with a college diploma.	0
ClaimBuster	24156				We need to make sure as well that we coordinate this effort with our allies, and particularly with -- with Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	24157				It's going to be one of my highest priorities because transportation accounts for about 30 percent of our total energy consumption.	1
ClaimBuster	24158				Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum.	1
ClaimBuster	24159				Just on Monday of this week I signed a tax bill that included an amendment that would prevent companies in the United States from taking a tax deduction if they have in any way whatsoever cooperated with the Arab boycott.	1
ClaimBuster	24160				And instead directed the money toward a tax cut, a significant part of which went to wealthy interests.	1
ClaimBuster	24161				But Governor Clinton refuses to touch that, simply refuses.	1
ClaimBuster	24162				And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there.	0
ClaimBuster	24163				I pass factories that were thriving 20, 25 years ago, and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100 percent, it is just horrible what's happened to these people in these communities.	1
ClaimBuster	24164				And last week when we were trying to get the Export Administration Act through the Congress - necessary legislation - my administration went to Capitol Hill and tried to convince the House and the Senate that we should have an amendment on that legislation which would take strong and effective action against those who uh - participate or cooperate with the Arab uh boycott.	1
ClaimBuster	24165				And the result is our forces today are overextended.	0
ClaimBuster	24166				I of course disagree with Senator Kennedy insofar as his suggestions as to what should be done uh - with re- on the farm program.	0
ClaimBuster	24167				The world is more dangerous today because the president didn't make the right judgments.	0
ClaimBuster	24168				And I'm very happy that John Kennedy was elected, because John Kennedy looked at the future with courage, saw what needed to be done, and understood his own government.	0
ClaimBuster	24169				In the aftermath of Vietnam, Cambodia, Chile, Pakistan, Angola, Watergate, CIA, we've been hurt.	0
ClaimBuster	24170				Well -- well, but she said one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	24171				I think we have to make a greater effort than we have been making at the secretary of state level, at the ambassadorial level, to work out the differences that we have.	0
ClaimBuster	24172				So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders.	1
ClaimBuster	24173				I wouldn't violate anything my mother said.	0
ClaimBuster	24174				So, first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	24175				It will come from the pockets of the people.	0
ClaimBuster	24176				They've wound up not even extending unemployment benefits and not even extending health care to those people who are unemployed.	1
ClaimBuster	24177				So it's easy to talk about this stuff during a campaign, but it's important for us to understand that it requires a sustained effort from the next president.	0
ClaimBuster	24178				And how do we expect to be able to implement those?	0
ClaimBuster	24179				They will want to do what's good for our country.	0
ClaimBuster	24180				Nobody suggested sending troops to Iraq, if that was the hint there from the President.	1
ClaimBuster	24181				If you leave a business, I think your insurance should go with you to some other business.	0
ClaimBuster	24182				"We just did a drug bust a week earlier, and the guy we arrested had an AK-47 lying on the bed right beside him. """	1
ClaimBuster	24183				He raised a whole bunch of them.	0
ClaimBuster	24184				That's why I'm so strong for accountability.	0
ClaimBuster	24185				It was locker room talk, as I told you.	1
ClaimBuster	24186				We ought to reach out, make certain everybody has a chance to participate.	0
ClaimBuster	24187				And it's going to take discipline of the executive branch; it's going to take discipline of the congressional branch.	0
ClaimBuster	24188				But again, we have a big difference on child care, for example.	0
ClaimBuster	24189				People in the coal industry feel like it's getting crushed by your policies.	1
ClaimBuster	24190				Businesses can contribute, employees can contribute on a contractual basis.	0
ClaimBuster	24191				Colin Powell will be on somebody's ticket 4 years from now -- right?	0
ClaimBuster	24192				He would also strip away the ability of states to provide some of the regulations on insurance companies to make sure you're not excluded for pre-existing conditions or your mammograms are covered or your maternity is covered.	0
ClaimBuster	24193				So I believe America's less safe.	0
ClaimBuster	24194				Now, if later on after a period of time we find that Social Security is in trouble, we'll pull together the top experts of the country.	0
ClaimBuster	24195				There is no question that the poor are worse off.	0
ClaimBuster	24196				The problem, Mr. Bush, is that you've cut back by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable housing for families of low and moderate income.	1
ClaimBuster	24197				But the important thing is -- the important thing is I visited Afghanistan and I traveled to Waziristan and I traveled to these places and I know what our security requirements are.	1
ClaimBuster	24198				I was going to applaud, too.	0
ClaimBuster	24199				One last point on the missiles.	0
ClaimBuster	24200				But let me talk back about where we've been.	0
ClaimBuster	24201				I proposed one to the Congress two years ago, encourages conservation, encourages technology to explore for environmentally friendly ways for coal -- to use coal and gas.	1
ClaimBuster	24202				You took General Motors bankrupt.	1
ClaimBuster	24203				And this is something Republicans have used for a long time.	1
ClaimBuster	24204				We're No.1 in automobile manufacturing production and sales around the world again, the first time since 1970s.	1
ClaimBuster	24205				I don't know of a city in America that doesn't have the kind of problems you're talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	24206				And nobody's going to question my patriotism as the vice president has now repeatedly.	0
ClaimBuster	24207				Now we have a very, very wide-ranging group of advisers who help me prepare for these debates and who teach me about international economics, and foreign affairs, defense matters, health, education, welfare, government reorganization.	1
ClaimBuster	24208				I also think that that unborn child has a right to be wanted.	0
ClaimBuster	24209				And I appreciated the way the administration signed the Defense of Marriage Act.	0
ClaimBuster	24210				But nobody called Sean Hannity.	1
ClaimBuster	24211				This is the kind of record that's there and talk about the future and a drastic change or conversion on the part of Mr. Ford as of last minute is one that just doesn't go.	0
ClaimBuster	24212				The only thing I believe is that whatever the - the knowledge was that Mr. Ford had should have been given to the American people eighteen months ago, immediately after the Mayaguez uh - incident occurred.	0
ClaimBuster	24213				We are not at war.	1
ClaimBuster	24214				I don't think we should spend tax money on private schools.	0
ClaimBuster	24215				So we've got to figure out how are we going to have more people with pension plans, and pension coverage has been declining as more and more people work for small businesses and fewer people work for big businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	24216				It's a threat to the stability of the entire Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	24217				We're all focused on China.	0
ClaimBuster	24218				And we have to stop the violence.	0
ClaimBuster	24219				We're 9 million jobs short of that.	1
ClaimBuster	24220				Both at home and abroad, he has proposed wrong and reckless policies.	0
ClaimBuster	24221				The commanders and the generals there are on track to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	24222				It took me about three years to completely reorganize the Georgia government.	1
ClaimBuster	24223				We need to put the pressure on them as hard as we possibly can, because if we do that, we won't have to take the military action.	0
ClaimBuster	24224				We have no plans to sell additional materiel or goods to Iran, that might be of a warlike nature.	0
ClaimBuster	24225				I uh - believe, however, a comment ought to be made about the direction of the uh - Burger Court, vis-a-vis the uh - court uh - that preceded it.	0
ClaimBuster	24226				Well, I was raised to have a faith and a belief and have been a member of a church since I was a small boy.	1
ClaimBuster	24227				I think that is the wrong choice.	0
ClaimBuster	24228				I strongly support new investments in clean coal technology.	0
ClaimBuster	24229				That makes a difference in whether they can go out there and -- and earn a living for their family.	0
ClaimBuster	24230				Now, Governor Romney has ruled out revenue.	1
ClaimBuster	24231				We didn't recognize them for two months; the American Ambassador didn't show up for nearly eight months.	1
ClaimBuster	24232				It does not happen that the church that I belong to had that as part of its dogma.	1
ClaimBuster	24233				And I believe if we do a better job in education, we'll -- we'll give people the -- the hope and opportunity they deserve and perhaps less violence from that.	0
ClaimBuster	24234				But -- but I want to talk about the values behind Social Security and Medicare, and then talk about Medicare, because that's the big driver of our deficits right now.	0
ClaimBuster	24235				Let me tell you where the biggest discrimination comes.	0
ClaimBuster	24236				If you like your high premiums, you keep them.	0
ClaimBuster	24237				I think it might have been one of my opponent's ads.	0
ClaimBuster	24238				It may be Republican, it may be Democratic.	0
ClaimBuster	24239				But let me just say to America: I am not proposing a government-run program.	0
ClaimBuster	24240				It's because we got everybody to agree that Iran is seeing so much pressure.	0
ClaimBuster	24241				And they came up with a variety of ideas for people to look at.	0
ClaimBuster	24242				I was honored to speak to those troops.	0
ClaimBuster	24243				So Congress passes the law, the President signs it, like he does a lot of things.	1
ClaimBuster	24244				A year ago, I went to Wall Street and said we've got to reregulate, and nothing happened.	1
ClaimBuster	24245				And that's what Osama bin Laden's handbook said, because we captured it in Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	24246				The Economist magazine polled lots of economists, seven Nobel prize winners who said if this tax scheme passes, it will require huge cuts, 40 percent, in the environment and law enforcement and education.	1
ClaimBuster	24247				We can't afford that kind of growth in federal spending.	0
ClaimBuster	24248				And some of the cuts, just to give you an example, we spend $15 billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies.	1
ClaimBuster	24249				It all sounds to me like you're going to have some government setting price.	0
ClaimBuster	24250				You might remember the stock market started to decline dramatically six months before I came to office, and then the bubble of the 1990s popped.	1
ClaimBuster	24251				See, Willow Run could be converted from cars to airplanes in World War II because it was here.	1
ClaimBuster	24252				But I -- I couldn't do that.	0
ClaimBuster	24253				They shouldn't misuse their bench.	0
ClaimBuster	24254				We're selling Japanese rice from California for the first time.	1
ClaimBuster	24255				I respect their -- I respect -- on the one hand he says he agrees with me and then he says he doesn't.	0
ClaimBuster	24256				He's been in the United States Senate 20 years.	1
ClaimBuster	24257				And it's a disgrace, and I will do my level best to clean it up, recognizing that you can't legislate morality.	0
ClaimBuster	24258				And let's take the example of energy, which we already spoke about.	0
ClaimBuster	24259				Well, how about this for a government reform policy?	0
ClaimBuster	24260				And I know it's necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	24261				As a matter of fact, there has been less than one-quarter of 1 percent of foreclosures of the 270,000 loans from government that the farmers have.	1
ClaimBuster	24262				In some ways, he's gone to a more extreme place when it comes to social policy.	0
ClaimBuster	24263				And the breakdown of the political process in Ukraine between Tymoshenko and Yushchenko is a very serious problem.	0
ClaimBuster	24264				But we know from the people he's tried to appoint to the court he wants to.	0
ClaimBuster	24265				Are you for it without quotas?	0
ClaimBuster	24266				Help me pass these programs.	0
ClaimBuster	24267				Right now we spend about $300 billion a year on defense, the Japanese spend around 30 billion in Asia, the Germans spend around 30 billion in Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	24268				And you've got to be firm and consistent.	0
ClaimBuster	24269				Companies are going to locate here depending on whether we've got the most highly skilled workforce.	1
ClaimBuster	24270				I think these questions are inherently personal and moral, and every individual instance is different.	0
ClaimBuster	24271				And so let's look at our records as well as our rhetoric.	0
ClaimBuster	24272				But when I was in that little church across the river from Washington and saw our grandchild christened in our faith, I was very pleased indeed that the mother had not aborted that child, and put the child up for adoption.	1
ClaimBuster	24273				Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly -- and she was extremely angry about it.	1
ClaimBuster	24274				Now, in this connection I want to point out that the facts simply aren't as stated.	0
ClaimBuster	24275				It's not about President Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	24276				It starts with making sure every child learns to read.	0
ClaimBuster	24277				You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue?	1
ClaimBuster	24278				We can't leave a failed Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	24279				As soon as I have -- first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	24280				When that field is online it will produce one million barrels a day.	0
ClaimBuster	24281				I would also like to uh - completely revise our criminal justice system - to do some of the things at the federal level in court reform that I've just described, as has been done in Georgia and other states.	0
ClaimBuster	24282				I don't want to hear them.	0
ClaimBuster	24283				Number 2, we would provide 2-year apprenticeship programs to high school graduates who don't go to college.	0
ClaimBuster	24284				It's what the federal government does to you.	0
ClaimBuster	24285				We should have been much tougher on trade even then.	0
ClaimBuster	24286				There's another group that I feel very close to, and these at the men and women who fought on the battlefield, the children -- the families -- of the ones who died and the people who left parts of their bodies over there.	0
ClaimBuster	24287				Now Senator Kennedy has made some very strong criticisms of my part - or alleged part - in what has happened in Cuba.	1
ClaimBuster	24288				You didn't do that with Mr. with President Bush in 1992.	1
ClaimBuster	24289				And I stand for programs that will mean growth and progress.	0
ClaimBuster	24290				This is going to take fair, shared sacrifice.	0
ClaimBuster	24291				If the president's reelected, Obamacare will be fully installed.	0
ClaimBuster	24292				This is the most religious, great country in history.	0
ClaimBuster	24293				I have never heard a candidate for President, who is a Republican, quote a Republican president, but when they get in office, they try to govern like Republicans.	0
ClaimBuster	24294				But I have tremendous respect for women.	0
ClaimBuster	24295				I do not want any more trickle down government.	0
ClaimBuster	24296				And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	24297				And what we're seeing right now is, in my view, a -- a trickle-down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams.	0
ClaimBuster	24298				Also, in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia and uh - Watergate and uh - the CIA revelations, people have feel - have felt that they've uh been betrayed by public officials, I have to admit that in the uh - heat of the campaign - I've been in thirty primaries during the springtime, I've been campaigning for twenty-two months - I've made some mistakes.	1
ClaimBuster	24299				But I am somebody who believes that Roe versus Wade was rightly decided.	0
ClaimBuster	24300				Let's talk about the programs.	0
ClaimBuster	24301				Do you want jobs in the inner city?	0
ClaimBuster	24302				Now, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand.	0
ClaimBuster	24303				We were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983.	1
ClaimBuster	24304				But we had also better be darn sure we don't leave and make the situation worse, thereby exacerbating our reputation and our ability to address crises in other parts of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	24305				Two years ago, I warned that, because of the subprime lending mess, because of the lax regulation, that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time.	1
ClaimBuster	24306				I think the General Motors thing is very relevant.	0
ClaimBuster	24307				And third, is it even necessary for the President to be so intimately involved in strategic details?	0
ClaimBuster	24308				A President must know those things.	0
ClaimBuster	24309				And there is every evidence, every indication that that government would be hostile to the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	24310				Iran is bordered very extensively by the Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	24311				Not because I agreed with their ideology, but because I thought they were qualified and that elections have consequences when presidents are nominated.	0
ClaimBuster	24312				We busted the 4th largest army, and we did it through leadership.	1
ClaimBuster	24313				So let me try to answer you in this way.	0
ClaimBuster	24314				They're the fundamental aspect of America's economy.	0
ClaimBuster	24315				I have voted in the last uh - eight years uh - and the Vice President was uh - presiding over the Senate and meeting his other responsibilities.	1
ClaimBuster	24316				I mean, it's -- you know, and I've been saying at big speeches where I have 20,000 and 30,000 people, what do you have to lose?	1
ClaimBuster	24317				When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	24318				I do think that he inappropriately drew a comparison between what was happening there and what had happened during the civil rights movement, and we immediately put out a statement saying that we don't think that comparison is appropriate.	1
ClaimBuster	24319				That's something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don't get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.	1
ClaimBuster	24320				They are now 27.5 miles per gallon per automobile fleet.	1
ClaimBuster	24321				Last week I broke up -- I suspended campaigning for two days, or parts of two days, to go back and participate in the meetings that charted the President's summit meeting that he just returned from earlier today.	1
ClaimBuster	24322				I've been a person who has to set a clear vision and convince people to follow.	0
ClaimBuster	24323				I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them.	0
ClaimBuster	24324				You keep your own doctor.	1
ClaimBuster	24325				And if I'm elected president, I will do something about that.	0
ClaimBuster	24326				No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them.	0
ClaimBuster	24327				Of course, we're going to find Osama bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	24328				I ask you to allow me the privilege of leading this great nation of ours, of helping us to be stronger here at home and to be respected again in the world and, most of all, to be safer forever.	0
ClaimBuster	24329				He wants to give average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	24330				And it's a time for government to understand and to cooperate with our people.	0
ClaimBuster	24331				We've seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten.	1
ClaimBuster	24332				And those pessimists who say it can't be done, I'm sorry, I just have a fundamental disagreement with them	0
ClaimBuster	24333				Well, Governor Romney's right, you are familiar with jobs being shipped overseas because you invested in companies that were shipping jobs overseas.	1
ClaimBuster	24334				Now the Republican platform will cost more too.	0
ClaimBuster	24335				Like Jerry Brown, the 800 number.	1
ClaimBuster	24336				I must say that I think I have better opportunity, however, of finding the necessary funds to pay what, admittedly, will be very, very substantial sums of money.	0
ClaimBuster	24337				This is a president who has not met with the civil rights leadership of our country.	1
ClaimBuster	24338				Starting when they're 3 and going to this school until they're 9 and then going into the public school in the 4th grade.	0
ClaimBuster	24339				Now, what happened in July we've covered again and again and again.	1
ClaimBuster	24340				Your doctor chooses your prescription.	1
ClaimBuster	24341				The coalition against Saddam has fallen apart or it's unraveling, let's put it that way.	0
ClaimBuster	24342				It's not driven by members of Congress, and what they would like to see.	0
ClaimBuster	24343				I've kept the faith with my country.	0
ClaimBuster	24344				Today, 47 million people are on food stamps.	1
ClaimBuster	24345				And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles.	0
ClaimBuster	24346				And I'll tell you what, the Treasury should demand that money back and those executives should be fired.	0
ClaimBuster	24347				"""I said, ""OK, you've got a deal."	1
ClaimBuster	24348				I think it's whether you share the broad dreams of the American people, whether you have confidence in the people's ability to get things done or whether you think it all should be turned over, as many of the liberals do, to Washington, D.C. You see, I think it's a question of values, not likability or loveability, it's a question in foreign affairs in experience, knowing world leaders, knowing how to build on a superb record of this administration in arms control, because you'd know exactly how to begin.	0
ClaimBuster	24349				And secondly, to think that another round of resolutions would have caused Saddam Hussein to disarm, disclose, is ludicrous, in my judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	24350				There are some things I don't understand.	0
ClaimBuster	24351				And we are seeing a major offensive taking place -- Al Qaida and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion.	1
ClaimBuster	24352				It's a fundamental difference of opinion here, folks.	0
ClaimBuster	24353				In the first place, never go back to that Democratic grain embargo, that liberal Democrat grain embargo that knocked the markets right out from under us and made Mr. Gorbachev say to me when I was here, how do I know you're reliable suppliers?	1
ClaimBuster	24354				And if we had asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him.	0
ClaimBuster	24355				And I'm sorry, but demonstrating -- it's not a question of patriotism.	0
ClaimBuster	24356				"The president is the one that said, ""We can't allow countries to get nuclear weapons."""	1
ClaimBuster	24357				Over the last 5 years our income has grown more rapidly than the national average.	1
ClaimBuster	24358				At the same time, we have to be prepared.	0
ClaimBuster	24359				It's against the law in the United States to hire people illegally, and we ought to be enforcing that law properly.	1
ClaimBuster	24360				We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them.	1
ClaimBuster	24361				And you look at our miners.	0
ClaimBuster	24362				And I'll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	24363				$90 billion, that would have -- that would have hired 2 million teachers.	1
ClaimBuster	24364				I want to see more vouchers.	0
ClaimBuster	24365				And that means that there will be more industrial activity.	0
ClaimBuster	24366				You're running ads right now that say that I oppose federal funding for stem cell research.	1
ClaimBuster	24367				Let me start with how to control the cost of health care: medical liability reform, for starters, which he's opposed.	1
ClaimBuster	24368				So I would say our prestige is not so high.	0
ClaimBuster	24369				Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons and the world is more dangerous.	1
ClaimBuster	24370				We would like to see the Russians use that sway to encourage democracy to take hold.	0
ClaimBuster	24371				Did I get that right?	0
ClaimBuster	24372				We're a country that owes $20 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	24373				And even some in your own party couldn't buy that.	0
ClaimBuster	24374				We learned our lesson again in Korea, We must not learn it again.	0
ClaimBuster	24375				And the Congress by overriding the bills that I did veto, the Congress has added some $13 billion to the federal expenditures and to the federal deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	24376				We've got to clean this mess up, leave this country in good shape, and pass on the American dream to them.	0
ClaimBuster	24377				We ought to agree that somebody else should do it.	0
ClaimBuster	24378				We went out and built housing.	1
ClaimBuster	24379				Young folks saying I'm going to do something good for my country.	0
ClaimBuster	24380				It has imposed on the individual freedoms of the people, and there are more of these things that could be solved by the people themselves, if they were given a chance, or by the levels of government that were closer to them.	0
ClaimBuster	24381				Because the Soviet change is not fully established yet.	0
ClaimBuster	24382				One last point I should make.	0
ClaimBuster	24383				And that was the serious, serious threat.	0
ClaimBuster	24384				We have a duty to defeat this enemy.	0
ClaimBuster	24385				Now, we have allocated $750 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	24386				Mr. President, I accept your commitment to peace, but I want you to accept my commitment to a strong national defense.	0
ClaimBuster	24387				We're going to make America great.	0
ClaimBuster	24388				Fortunately, he has been during Democratic as well as Republican administrations.	1
ClaimBuster	24389				Well, it was very -- I say nothing.	0
ClaimBuster	24390				How about a line item veto?	0
ClaimBuster	24391				For example, in our State of Texas I worked with the legislature, both Republicans and Democrats, to pass a law that said if you come in the top 10% of your high school class, you're automatically admitted to one of our higher institutions of learning, college.	1
ClaimBuster	24392				The money stays within the Social Security system.	0
ClaimBuster	24393				-- and Glaspie's papers have been presented to the US Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	24394				We've got to show moral support for Georgia.	0
ClaimBuster	24395				We've had some disagreements about that.	1
ClaimBuster	24396				We now have five nations that have atomic bombs that we know about.	1
ClaimBuster	24397				This president has made, I regret to say, a colossal error of judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	24398				Number two, what's important is occasionally you've got to say no, to -- to -- to folks both in your own party and in the other party.	0
ClaimBuster	24399				Your question was on fairness.	0
ClaimBuster	24400				I don't admire Fidel Castro at all.	0
ClaimBuster	24401				Well, we all make mistakes.	0
ClaimBuster	24402				But I think, by improving productivity, they would be far less inflationary than the consumption-oriented tax cut that Governor Reagan is recommending.	0
ClaimBuster	24403				So for those reasons, for the tax, for Medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurance, this is why the American people don't want Medicare -- don't want Obamacare.	1
ClaimBuster	24404				How can we build a strong America militarily that's teeter-tottering on a mountain of debt?	0
ClaimBuster	24405				Governor Reagan, as a matter of fact, began his political career campaigning around this nation against Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	24406				Whether we're going to move a million people from welfare to work.	0
ClaimBuster	24407				But thank goodness we've always had enough people who have been willing in every generation to push past the fear of a broken heart and become deeply involved in forming a more perfect union.	0
ClaimBuster	24408				And we shifted people out of administrative jobs into the field to deliver better services.	1
ClaimBuster	24409				I believe that we should meet our commitments, and if the Chinese Communists attack the Pescadores and Formosa, they know that it will mean a war.	0
ClaimBuster	24410				The Senate has not voted yet on the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty.	1
ClaimBuster	24411				We have an opportunity, really, if you think about it, if we're smart and have got a strategic vision and a leader who understands strategic planning, to make sure that we change the terms of the battlefield of the future so we can keep the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	24412				As a matter of fact, during this current year uh we are shipping Iran, or have contracted to ship to Iran, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms and also to Saudi Arabia, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms.	1
ClaimBuster	24413				Those are all things that we put in the Democratic platform for the first time this year, and I think that's where we can find some common ground, because nobody's pro-abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	24414				So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.	0
ClaimBuster	24415				And that is the current campaign financing system.	0
ClaimBuster	24416				We must be very, very realistic in the nature of that leadership, but we must grind away and talk to find ways of reducing these differences, particularly where arms races are concerned and other dangerous exercises of Soviet power.	0
ClaimBuster	24417				Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment.	0
ClaimBuster	24418				But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary's leaving.	0
ClaimBuster	24419				And frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	24420				The war on terror is to make sure that these terrorist organizations do not end up with weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	24421				It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine-tenths billion dollar a year more than we're presently spending.	1
ClaimBuster	24422				When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what's happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we've made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	24423				I want to give a special thanks to my wife Elizabeth, my daughter Robin for their love and support, and thank the people who are listening and watching all over America.	0
ClaimBuster	24424				That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.	0
ClaimBuster	24425				That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she -- frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.	0
ClaimBuster	24426				And our best days are ahead of us.	0
ClaimBuster	24427				No, I don't have an answer for everything.	0
ClaimBuster	24428				And therefore, when they have to try to purchase drugs they do so on their own, there's no kind of collective bargaining, no power of purchasing among seniors.	0
ClaimBuster	24429				I've had some arguments with him about the speed in which we might have lowered interest rates, but Governor Clinton, he talks about the reaction to the markets.	0
ClaimBuster	24430				We will meet our commitments to maintain the freedom and independence of West Berlin.	0
ClaimBuster	24431				And I believe President Bush and I both love our country equally.	0
ClaimBuster	24432				Social Security is structurally sound.	0
ClaimBuster	24433				By the way, North Korea, most repressive and brutal regime probably on Earth.	0
ClaimBuster	24434				We have to determine when our interests are involved, not the United Nations' interests.	0
ClaimBuster	24435				Senator Obama says that it has to be safe or disposable or something like that.	1
ClaimBuster	24436				But there are some things that government can do and some things they cannot do.	0
ClaimBuster	24437				I believe we ought to measure a lot, three, four, five, six, seven, eighth grade.	0
ClaimBuster	24438				I'm just talking about the 12.8 percent that he paid, and that's what's happening all over this country with wealthy Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	24439				This is the way the framers of the Constitution intended our government to be, a government that comes from the people.	0
ClaimBuster	24440				Well, if you'll turn on the television, as I -- I watched the Arizona Cardinals defeat the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday.	1
ClaimBuster	24441				But I think in terms of the recession, of course you feel it when you're president of the US.	0
ClaimBuster	24442				I volunteered for the Army.	1
ClaimBuster	24443				It also means that we can target things easier and move more quickly, which means we need to be lighter and quicker and more facile and highly trained.	0
ClaimBuster	24444				I am a firm believer that our America 2000 education problem is the answer--a little longer run; it's going to take awhile to educate.	0
ClaimBuster	24445				I don't want to go down the path to Spain.	0
ClaimBuster	24446				And while he's been diverted, with 9 out of 10 active duty divisions of our Army, either going to Iraq, coming back from Iraq, or getting ready to go, North Korea's gotten nuclear weapons and the world is more dangerous.	1
ClaimBuster	24447				If you can't get your act together to pick him up one day when a Panamanian major has kidnapped him and a special forces team is 400 yards away and it's a stroll across the park to get him, and if you can't get your act together, at least pick up the Panamanian major, who they then killed, step up to the plate and admit it was a mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	24448				All of these things suggested, I think, to the Iranian mullahs that, hey, you know, we can keep on pushing along here, we can keep talks going on, we're just going to keep on spinning centrifuges.	0
ClaimBuster	24449				To the American people, I'm doing this because I love you.	0
ClaimBuster	24450				There are all these studies out there.	0
ClaimBuster	24451				You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore...	1
ClaimBuster	24452				And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did.	0
ClaimBuster	24453				The Commander-in-Chief was organizing demonstrations halfway around the world during another era.	1
ClaimBuster	24454				And I've been the chief executive officer of the second biggest state in the union.	1
ClaimBuster	24455				Obviously, I disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to Russians going into Georgia.	1
ClaimBuster	24456				The best expression of my family values is that tonight's my 17th wedding anniversary, and I'd like to close my question by just wishing my wife a happy anniversary, and thank you, my daughter, for being here.	1
ClaimBuster	24457				We've done a lot of hard work together over the last three and a half years.	0
ClaimBuster	24458				They'll be able to compete.	0
ClaimBuster	24459				Finally, to you students up there -- God bless you, I'm doing this for you: I want you to have the American dream.	0
ClaimBuster	24460				I think that would be a mistake, because I think one of the ways we've been able to be so successful in Kosovo and Bosnia and Haiti and in other places is by having the technological edge.	0
ClaimBuster	24461				He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote with him and lost by one vote.	1
ClaimBuster	24462				So you got to have a judicial intervention.	0
ClaimBuster	24463				While I was governor, I was proud that our fourth graders came out number one of all 50 states in English, and then also in math.	1
ClaimBuster	24464				A free Iraq will enforce the hopes and aspirations of the reformers in places like Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	24465				It's probably $5 trillion that we can't bring into our country, Lester.	1
ClaimBuster	24466				I've been fighting for changes in the exclusionary rule so if an honest cop stops somebody and makes a technical mistake, the criminal doesn't go away.	0
ClaimBuster	24467				But my strategy is broader than that.	0
ClaimBuster	24468				I've actually passed 56 individual bills that I've personally written and, in addition to that, and not always under my name, there is amendments on certain bills.	1
ClaimBuster	24469				And I assume some of those are because of our trading partners.	0
ClaimBuster	24470				I called upon the Congress not to hamstring the administration, and in terms of forcing troop withdrawals on a timetable that wasn't necessarily in our best interest or fit our nation's strategy, and so I think it's good public policy, I think it worked, and I'm pleased I took -- made the decision I made.	0
ClaimBuster	24471				And one thing we have to do: Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.	0
ClaimBuster	24472				Well, I think that, given what's happened over the last several weeks and months, our entire Russian approach has to be evaluated, because a resurgent and very aggressive Russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the region.	0
ClaimBuster	24473				Because we disagree very fundamentally on the position of the United States, and if his view prevails then I think that's going to bring an important result to this country in the sixties.	0
ClaimBuster	24474				Number two, John McCain and I have a proposal, jointly, for a commission that closes corporate giveaway loopholes.	1
ClaimBuster	24475				spending - we can afford the tax cuts I have proposed and probably mainly because Mr. Carter's economic policy has built into the next five years, and on beyond that, a tax increase that will be taking $86 billion more out of the people's pockets than was taken this year.	0
ClaimBuster	24476				We had a legitimate difference, and I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	24477				We wanted to end the bloodshed in southern Africa.	0
ClaimBuster	24478				And here's what we can do.	0
ClaimBuster	24479				I just -- I think there has been -- some of the scientists, I believe, Mr. Vice President, haven't they been changing their opinion a little bit on global warming?	0
ClaimBuster	24480				Secondly, he has mentioned the problem of our older citizens.	1
ClaimBuster	24481				We've got to fix our health care system and we've got to invest in our education system for every young person to be able to learn.	0
ClaimBuster	24482				Our country has tremendous problems.	0
ClaimBuster	24483				Is it -- is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them?	0
ClaimBuster	24484				And we're not going to be able to deal with the climate crisis if our only solution is to use more fossil fuels that create global warming.	0
ClaimBuster	24485				Pharmaceuticals were using loopholes to keep brand -- brand drugs in place, and generics are much less expensive than brand drugs.	1
ClaimBuster	24486				That, I think, in addition, would be an anti-inflationary measure that would strengthen the economy of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	24487				Well, I've been a senator, Donald...	1
ClaimBuster	24488				And unfortunately, that's the kind of opinions that you've offered throughout this campaign, and it is not a recipe for American strength, or keeping America safe over the long haul.	0
ClaimBuster	24489				I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	24490				28 years ago, as a young man just graduated from law school, I came to this city, came clear across the country, to watch John Kennedy be nominated for the presidency of the United States, right here in Los Angeles.	1
ClaimBuster	24491				And I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it's the same plan.	1
ClaimBuster	24492				That is a red line for us, because not only is Israel's security at stake, but our security is at stake if that unravels.	0
ClaimBuster	24493				Did we have any allies helping?	0
ClaimBuster	24494				I come from West Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	24495				And we're not doing what we ought to do in terms of the technology.	0
ClaimBuster	24496				And I would just like to say that this debate in a way is a living tribute to Mel Carnahan because he loved the vigorous discussion of ideas in our democracy.	1
ClaimBuster	24497				African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities.	1
ClaimBuster	24498				If you have a heart problem, you don't wait till a heart attack to address it.	0
ClaimBuster	24499				The federal government spends seven percent of the total on education, and the rest of the state governments and local governments and the thousand points of lightened I'm talking about private schools and private church schools and things of this nature--are putting up 93 percent.	1
