WTP	0	It is much longer and omits the steps taken by the church to prevent future abuse . 	0
WTP	1	How about whitelisting a link to the " Encyclopedia Thelemica " , which is at www . lashtal . com / wiki / and which can ' t conceivably be considered a " social networking site " ? 	0
WTP	2	The initial quote by the Iranian translator was " wiped off the map " and that is what resulted in the notable outcry from world leaders . 	0
WTP	3	In the controversies article we devote a large section to the back-and-forth as to whether MA misspoke , was misquoted , or is backpedaling . 	0

WTP	7	In this article , however , we state simply : He also been accused in much of the West over a comment he made in against the " Zionist entity " to be " wiped off the map . " 	0
WTP	8	In the West this was coupled with accusation of describing the Holocaust as a myth and of making statements influenced by classic anti-Semitic ideas , which has led to accusations of anti-Semitism , though he has denied these accusations , saying that he " respects Jews very much " and that he was not " passing judgment " on the Holocaust . which brings the reliably cited accusations and refutations simply ; not imposing one reliable sources view over the other , and leave further discussion to the child article per summary style . 	0

WTP	10	There are still unresolved POV issues , issues with the writing and non-encyclopedic tone , reference and sourcing issues , and notable controversies glossed over and / or ignored . 	0

WTP	20	Hopefully this will remove this tulmutous chapter of Church history from the POV dispute . 	0
WTP	21	It is NPOV and cited . 	0
WTP	22	A section on the English reformation has been summarised from a GA article and inserted here . 	0
WTP	23	But anyway , this is not the place to discuss the merits of various news outlets . 	0
WTP	24	That ' s pretty funny . 	0
WTP	25	Even at the WP : RS / N-related pages , they generally don ' t paint any particular publication in black or white terms according to how accurate or how partisan it is . 	0
WTP	26	We consider citations here one at a time . 	0
WTP	27	Hi , I ' m quite happy with 	0
WTP	28	The list ' s title and inclusion criteria make it clear that this is NOT solely a list of WP : PSCI ' s " obvious pseudosciences " and " generally considered pseudosciences " . 	1
WTP	29	We can and do include " questionable science " , as well as " alternative theoretical formulations " , and even majority views , if sourced properly . 	0
WTP	30	Consensus is usually sufficient to remove the tag , but consensus isn ' t necessary to put it there in the first place ; indeed , it ' s usually a lack of consensus that leads editors to tag an article . 	0
WTP	31	It is uncollaborative to remove a tag without discussion [ 2 ] and for invalid reasons ( like " no consensus to include " ) [ 3 ] . 	0
WTP	32	Yes , of course it should . 	0
WTP	33	That ' s the whole purpose of tags : to flag articles so that fresh input can be obtained . 	0
WTP	34	Obviously , a tag need not be kept if it ' s clearly frivolous , but that ' s not the case here . 	0
WTP	35	While I think the tag should remain until agreement is reached , I personally don ' t share Levine2112 ' s concerns about NPOV in this case . 	1
WTP	36	If some editors don ' t think there are NPOV problems , then the venue for expressing that is to use this talk page , not to remove the tag . 	0
WTP	37	The same logic applies for , e . g , article RfC ' s or noticeboard postings : we don ' t just delete them because we disagree with them . 	0
WTP	38	Only the controversy over whether or not Wiki considers System of a Down nu metal , I think . 	0
WTP	39	Personally , I don ' t really consider them nu metal at this point , and our article on them lists them as alternative metal . 	0
WTP	40	Then you haven ' t viewed the latest UN report that asserts that Israeli soldiers deliberately attacked civilian targets in Gaza war . 	0
WTP	41	And even if those soldiers did not act upon supervisors ' instructions ( which I doubt ) ; those soldiers were not tried or punished to prevent similar incidents in the future . 	0
WTP	42	But again , this is all irrelevant to our dispute here . 	0
WTP	43	The point is here , WP : TERRORIST policy is clear , because usually there is in the story more than " someone is a terrorist " . 	0
WTP	44	And I don ' t see difference between calling someone a terrorist or saying that he uses terrorist tactics . 	0
WTP	45	It is already mentioned in the lead that many countries consider Hamas to be a terrorist organization and no one has objected to that , I don ' t understand why you are pushing now for this statement in the first lines of the article . 	0

WTP	67	But phone calls , unrelated estate claims and biographies of other people will not work either ( unless its the biography of a regular freemason who initiated Crowley , or the estate has information not previously published , but is now publishing ) . 	0
WTP	68	Lets try this and see if it works : I think this accurately depicts what is being disputed , who is disputing , and why they have the authority to dispute in the first place . 	0
WTP	69	We can ' t use words like some , as they ' re weasel words . 	0
WTP	70	We need to phrase it so that it accurately depicts who is saying what , and why , without going too far . 	0
WTP	71	On the topic of citations : a good counter citation would be one that discredits the current disppute of his connections with the UGLE or regular freemasonry . 	0
WTP	72	If you have these , then when can create a new section in the article that delves deeper into the matter and explores his connections with freemasonry . 	0
WTP	73	Removing the entire section wasn ' t a positive move toward change . 	0
WTP	74	I agree that there is a problem and I thank you for pointing this out . 	0
WTP	75	The British Columbia and Yukon Grand Lodge is listed as a regular lodge , so it does carry weight ( I believe I once argued against this being presented into the article ; check archive 4 ) . 	1
WTP	76	Although , the statement will need some modifications . 	1
WTP	77	Oh thank goodness ! 	0
WTP	78	That ' s been tried before and it is a really tiring discussion . 	0
WTP	79	As per lumping , I think it ' s just not important to rattle off a list . 	0
WTP	80	In AIDS denialism is the place to go over individuals . 	0
WTP	81	Provided the items are discussed in the article in the relevant section , then having illustrations is entirely appropriate . 	1
WTP	82	If it isn ' t , then the source is only presenting its opinion ( or in this case , characterization ) . 	0
WTP	83	And if we are going to allow characterizations made by sources which don ' t represent the scientific community in general but kind of slant towards that way , then we also have to include characterizations made by sources which slant the other way . 	0
WTP	84	I think some editors only want to include sources which are generally regarded as trustworthy / authoritative with regards to pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	85	If that were the case , this article would only include items which are definitively pseudoscientific per the scientific community in general ; for if a source is truly trustworthy / authoritative with regards to pseudoscience , then it speaks for scientific community in general . 	1
WTP	86	The sources which we choose should be trustworthy / authoritative in presenting the sources characterization . 	0
WTP	87	I think there might be confusion here . 	0
WTP	88	@Eldereft . 	0
WTP	89	Per your point - " generally regarded as trustworthy or authoritative in relation to the subject at hand " - remember that the subject at hand is not pseudoscience but rather the characterization of such . 	0
WTP	90	Essentially , this could be a black-and-white article where we only present items which are definitively pseuodscience per the scientific community in general . 	0
WTP	91	But once we allow " characterizations " in this article , it ceases to be black-and-white , but rather a range of gray . 	0
WTP	92	So what , specifically , are you objecting to here ? 	0
WTP	93	+ 	0
WTP	94	I agree with your comments , 	0
WTP	95	So saying there is no negative information in an article is no kind of argument . 	1
WTP	96	Say what you want to be included and why , and again be specific . 	0
WTP	97	If you feel that this bio is somehow bad state what you want to see and why but the contents on another person ' s bio is irrelevant here . 	0
WTP	98	If you feel that bio is unfair take it up there , not here . 	0
WTP	99	Vote to close and pretend this never happened . 	0
WTP	100	Keep spinning those wheels . 	0
WTP	101	And when we allow some notable gray and not some other notable gray , then this article will suffer of NPOV violations . 	0

WTP	105	Not at all , the article is under attack on the basis of WP : IDONTLIKEIT , Popper may have rephrased what he said , yet in the 1982 edition of the same book , ( 3 years after his supposed retraction ) the statement still stood . 	1

WTP	109	I ' ve done a little work on it , mainly earlier in the year , but for such an important article it is improving far too slowly and needs more contributors to get it up to at least a B class . 	0

WTP	111	PatrioticHippie , the problem with your attempt to correct perceived errors with Wikipedia is that your claims are incredibly vague . 	1
WTP	112	The article that focusses on his presidency will have a much more narrow focus and will include much of what I am assuming you wish to see in his bio . 	0
WTP	113	You may seek to include some of what you want to add under the sub article dedicated to Obama ' s presidency , provided they are sourced . 	0
WTP	114	Again vaguely saying there is negative stuff on Bush ' s articles and no negative stuff here isn ' t a real complaint . 	0
WTP	115	- - 	0
WTP	116	However , I think there is an argument for repositioning it ( and the accompanying text ? ) at the bottom as it might make someoen think that they ' ve read to the end of the article . 	1
WTP	117	By all means , and I am sure every editor would agree with me , if you feel there is something that is important enough to be included in his overall bio and not just a sub article , and it is well sourced , bring it up . 	0
WTP	118	I don ' t think that Wassupwestcoast ' s rewrite of the abuse scandal section is an improvement . 	1

WTP	134	I never once said Sabbath ' s importance was " false . " 	0
WTP	135	Saying that Sabbath single-handedly invented metal is hype , and about as correct as saying Zeppelin or Deep Purple single-handedly invented metal . 	1
WTP	136	However , so were the other groups mentioned . 	0
WTP	137	I ' ve spoken to about as many people who think that as think Sabbath was never metal at all . 	0
WTP	138	I ' ve never seen any popular consensus that Sabbath " invented " metal . 	0

WTP	237	San Francisco does function to some extent as a refuge for LGBT folks , with protections codified into law and an implicit understanding that things like gay-bashing are not tolerated there , so perhaps it does merit mention in the lead . 	0

WTP	261	I also eliminated some of the text regarding First Gentleman , which is purely speculative and thus innaproriate for this article . 	0
WTP	262	But if someone wants to remove aspects of this , I have a hard time imagining it will be as responsible a representation of what is left , and I ' d like to see these points addressed , not just undertaken . 	0
WTP	263	I think the whole section should be deleted from this bio entirely and moved to Presidency , and would applaud consensus to do so . 	0

WTP	270	It is non-controversial that Smith was a Christian at the time of the First Vision , is it not ? 	0
WTP	271	But I do think it is disproportionate to mention the abuse scandal in Australia , Canada , Ireland , Mexico , Poland and the United Kingdom , the large financial settlements in Ireland , the number of high ranking prelates who were involved , the affect on the Catholic faithful in Ireland and Poland and the actual number of the victims of the abusers including the methodology for determining the actual numbers . 	0

WTP	279	The word " Lady " in " First Lady " comes from her social role , and hence " First Master " , although doubtful , is possible . 	0

WTP	500	The source of the original controversy is a translation made by government funded sources , so we ' re looking to sources outside of the government now to clarify and verify . 	0

WTP	506	I - for one - do not think this article is NPOV . 	1
WTP	507	I think it is tightly POV in reference to the Catholic Church and is not a 360 degree view of the Church . 	0

WTP	510	And Zeppelin III ' s current five stars from Allmusicgiude ( wikipedia ' s biggest misplaced trust ) is pure hype , as we all know . 	0
WTP	511	Same goes for Led Zeppelin III ; it has always been seen as a relative downfall in the middle of Zeppelin II and Zeppelin IV , which were hailed from the start . 	0
WTP	512	Maybe Grand Funk Railroad were reviled because they never were any good ? 	0

WTP	517	I actually commented , just recently , on the Zeppelin article , where I criticized its overuse of reliance on Rolling Stone Magazine ; it practically bases its whole introduction with hails from that tacky magazine that includes 20 Beatles albums in its top 10 of the greatest albums ever . 	0
WTP	518	What I added later was that , as an Israeli and army veteran , it ' s easy to notice a few more details that identify the event better than a foreigner would . 	0

WTP	521	However , this is not relevant to the article , and constitutes original research . 	0

WTP	524	I do not consider that this gallery " adds to the reader ' s understanding of the " IDF by " illustrat [ ing ] aspects of [ the ] subject that cannot be easily or adequately described by text or individual images . " 	0
WTP	525	The images in the gallery collectively must have encyclopedic value and add to the reader ' s understanding of the subject . 	0
WTP	526	From WP : IG : However , the use of galleries ( usually by way of the gallery tag or gallery template ) may be appropriate in Wikipedia articles where a collection of images can illustrate aspects of a subject that cannot be easily or adequately described by text or individual images . 	0
WTP	527	Oh , I don ' t anything about that noticeboard . 	0
WTP	528	But get rid of the gallery . 	0
WTP	529	Obviously , if there is a large chunk of unadorned text , you can put a relevant image there . 	0
WTP	530	I ' ve given options for using some of your favourite images - replace the less useful existing ones . 	0
WTP	531	So the gallery should be scrapped . 	0

WTP	534	The part about Protestant propaganda per my source was that the two brutal non-church initiated or controlled inquisitions of Philip IV of France and Spanish Inquisition was used by Protestants to demonize the Catholic Church for centuries . 	0
WTP	535	I do not agree that the paragraph should have been changed to eliminate this fact . 	0
WTP	536	The Spanish Inquisition was the worst of them all and executed many people 3-4000 per my source . 	0
WTP	537	I disagree with the change also , I left a note on Xandars page . 	1
WTP	538	As the user also noted in their recent edits , the medical consensus on the issue is that HIV does cause AIDS . 	0
WTP	539	The lead was recently changed by User : Neuromancer to indicate that the causative role of HIV in AIDS isn ' t proven ( see diff ) . 	1
WTP	540	Thus I think adding a caveat about the unproven nature of HIV ' s causative role in AIDS isn ' t just an example of undue weight , but is furthermore incorrect . 	1
WTP	541	To my understanding , if medical consensus supports some hypothesis based on verifying experiments and overwhelming amounts of empirical evidence , then that notion is considered a scientific fact . 	0
WTP	542	Based on that rationale , I ' ve reverted Neuromancer ' s edits for the second time . 	1
WTP	543	Neuromancer also added to the lead a paragraph citing research from 1982 and 1983 , which I consider more appropriate for other sections of the article if it ' s to be included at all . 	0
WTP	544	I ' d like to get Neuromancer ' s thoughts on this , as well as feedback from other editors - - with whom I presume but would like to verify I share a consensus - - so that my recent reversion doesn ' t seem like a single-editor fiat . 	1
WTP	545	It ' s not articles on good things and bad things , it ' s just articles . 	0

WTP	548	Obviously , I would expect any book dealing with 1967 to discuss the USS Liberty incident . 	0
WTP	549	However , every book dealing with 1967 also discusses its various battles which are not mentioned in this article , and I don ' t think they should be . 	1
WTP	550	For example , with all due respect to the Battle of Ammunition Hill , likely more significant in the long term than the Liberty incident , it simply did not impact the IDF in a major way to be included here . 	0
WTP	551	Again , don ' t forget that we have a History of the Israel Defense Forces article , which I encourage people who want to go into more detail to have a look at . 	0
WTP	552	after reviewing the sources on the matter i believe the translation to something like " wipe zionism from the pages of history " seems to be more credible . 	1
WTP	553	with free online translation services there is no excuse not to go check the origin when available . 	0
WTP	554	we are discussing in english things said in parsi so we have to be extra careful and doubel check any resource claiming to bring a translation . 	1
WTP	555	as for the topic discussed , i think eyalmc has provided sufficient resources to show that the translation " wipe israel off the map " is a misquote . 	0

WTP	564	Name something you want to add , somthing that has reliable sources and something that is significant . 	0
WTP	565	I think the solution would be to move some of the content and sources to the article cunt ( which already discusses the issue but not in as much depth ) and the rest of the content to the Wiktionary entries on the words rabbit , coney , cunny etc . I ' m assuming you ' ll be ok with this so I ' m going to go ahead and make the necessary changes . 	0

WTP	567	I would be willing to consider this , but I suspect such an article may quickly find itself either merged back into this article or deleted . 	0
WTP	568	I also feel a little uncomfortable making such a move when your expressed purpose is still that of censorship . 	0
WTP	569	I simply cannot find in myself any impulse to limit who is allowed to read this content , because it expresses the truth , and the truth is never a bad thing to let someone read . 	0
WTP	570	However , if I am completely honest , I have to concede that going by the strict letter of the WP : NAD policy it may well be the case that the naming section does not really belong in this article regardless of objectionable content . 	1

WTP	577	But there have been enough wars involving such states in modern times that it really is something for which MILHIST ought to have developed techniques . 	0
WTP	578	I think this article suffers from some of that with glamorous pitures of equipment women soldiers , disucssion of the code of ethics in most of the article followed by the scandal . 	0
WTP	579	It would follow Wikipedia guidelines better if say discussion of scandals associated with particular wars occurred in the place where those wars are mentioned and if the more extreme ethical abuses were included in the discussion of the ethical cide . 	0
WTP	580	Controversy sections ( and even more so articles ) need to be handed with care as they often become content / POV forks . 	0
WTP	581	Do you get an article which mainly consists of blurb about how wonderful and saintly a particular person or institution is written by their fans or employees and then it has a subsection about how it has been claimed on an obscure website that they eat babies . 	0
WTP	582	It is of the nature of occupying armies that they abuse the occupied . 	0
WTP	583	Obviously it would be somewhat peculiar to have a controversies section in Roman Army saying that it sometimes sacked cities , raping , killing or enslaving large chunks of the population . 	0
WTP	584	also we should be aware of WP : Recentism and spend too much time on complaints about what happenned in Gaza just because it is fresh in our minds . 	0
WTP	585	On Wikifan ' s point about there not being similr coveerage elsewhere it might be worth an approach to the WP : MILHIST project and suggest they produce guidelines on how to deal with this . 	1
WTP	586	Controversies go in , as per WP : LEAD . 	0

WTP	593	As I ' m new to editing this page , you surmised correctly that I was unaware of any previous editing decisions such as having to abide by your consensus-approved outline . 	1
WTP	594	So I appreciate the synopsis here and I ' ve already performed an undo back to your approved version that had removed all my content . 	0
WTP	595	However , your arguments seem entirely based on this being " criticism " and the " scale " of the operation not fitting this article ' s scope . 	0
WTP	596	I still would contend that what I ' ve added , however " disproportionate " it might seem , is not what you describe and object to as " criticism " ; this is an incident of combat soldiers coming forward ( tardily ) to report on possible ( or evident ) breaches of the IDF # Code of Conduct against militants and Palestinian civilians during an operation fought in a densely populated area , that may be considered ( and ultimately judged ? ) as along the lines of atrocities or war crimes . 	1
WTP	597	If you and the other editors overrule this content ' s inclusion here , on what page — dealing with combat ethics in the IDF — would it belong ? 	0
WTP	598	I see there ' s no main article on Israel Defense Forces # Code of Conduct . - - 	0
WTP	599	I also have appreciated the efforts of numerous editors who have been watching the page and reverting vandalism , these have been a great help . 	0
WTP	600	I appreciate the bots and I did notice they were working - great invention . 	0
WTP	601	I hope consideration of future security will be considered if the vandalism increases , especially when we are at FAC . 	0
WTP	602	I just thought that an article like this would qualify for the kind of protection given other high profile articles , especially when we are on track towards FAC . 	0

WTP	609	Yes . 	0
WTP	610	This article is about a virus , HIV , not about opinions . 	0
WTP	611	Just a thought . 	0
WTP	612	Or something to that effect . 	0
WTP	613	I would suggest changing " HIV-specific treatment delays this process " to " HIV-specific treatments have been shown to delay this progression in most , though as with any form of chemotherapy , there are inherent risks . " 	0
WTP	614	I like what you ' ve done . . . 	0
WTP	615	Throwing it in there for you to roll it around your tongue for a few . 	0
WTP	616	Well , here are my two cents about what to cut ( based on what seems out of place for a lead , not based on any numeric target for length ) : 1 ) sentence starting " Previous names " ( none of these are in wide use today ) , 2 ) sentence starting " HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4 + T cells " ( too much detail for the lead ) , 3 ) somehow merge the paragraph starting " Eventually most HIV-infected individuals develop AIDS . " with the mentions elsewhere about opportunistic infections , antiretrovirals , etc ( I ' m not as sure about how to do this one ) . 	0
WTP	617	While consensus can block sources due to a lack of quality , it cannot block simply because they claim consensus . 	0
WTP	618	Furthermore , according to that same article , " Likewise , exceptional claims in Wikipedia require high-quality reliable sources , and , with clear editorial consensus , unreliable sources for exceptional claims may be rejected due to a lack of quality . " 	0
WTP	619	- - 	0
WTP	620	Logically , Wikipedia consensus should not be all that ' s needed to make a fringe theory notable , just as it should not be all that ' s needed to reject notable and well-sourced criticisms . 	0
WTP	621	As for the epidemiology , it does seem like a lot of numbers , but we should hit high points like the huge impact on Africa ( I ' ve trimmed a bit of the language but it could probably be shorter still ) . 	0
WTP	622	Until and unless one of the abovementioned things , or some other major detail , arises that fundamentally moves the story or resolves some loose end , I really don ' t see the problem with the size of the piece given what it covers . 	0
WTP	623	Quite probably ; if it does , then that would be what would be relevant to mention here , if Obama used this moment of crisis to set a new or accelerated course . 	0
WTP	624	If he doesn ' t , then that could be what would be relevant to mention , that despite this major incident we soldiered on with the drilling because ( the public / Southern governors / the oil industry complained that the loss of oil industry jobs was worse for the economy and the country than the possibility of future such accidents ? ) and as a result we were ( just fine / experienced a few more but as with terrorism under George W . Bush , that became the new normal / were utterly devastated by a series of catastrophes that ended life as we know it ) . 	0
WTP	625	That ' s the problem with news , it ' s just news until it ' s history . 	0
WTP	626	We could fight any mention of the spill , or we could acknowledge that unlike other distractions this is a real thing with likely real repercussions in the real world , and err on the side of making this section , you know , bigger than the automaker rescue and almost as big as health care ( both of which are also still unfolding and yet to be added to or updated ) . 	0
WTP	627	At such time as there is a clear culprit for the cause , we could then focus on that and drop one or even two of the other company names in this bio version of the story , but until such time , that would be irresponsible . 	0
WTP	628	At such time as the commission announces measures and Obama enacts them , we can shift the focus of those mentions to that enactment . 	0
WTP	629	At such time as there is a real and understood shift in energy or environmental policy , we might drop a couple other issues to note that . 	0
WTP	630	If someone wants to remove the criticism that Obama and the federal government should do more , we can whittle down some of what he ' s done , but if we did that , people would arrive re-adding that aspect . 	0
WTP	631	I ' ll say it again , if someone wants to remove the whole thing pending something that actually has major relevance to Obama ' s biography , I will not object at all . 	0
WTP	632	I give up on anti-semitic link , not big deal . 	0
WTP	633	My thoughts are that you make very weird silly argument . 	0
WTP	634	Wiped off map link links to exact section , not just main article so it is helpful . 	0
WTP	635	People know what that means . 	0
WTP	636	No interpret here , just know how to read English . 	0
WTP	637	And the very weird part of your argument is that I do some interpretation by linking words " Zionist regime " to article " Zionist regime " . 	0
WTP	638	But that " just enough " of course has to be accurate . 	0
WTP	639	We should explain just enough so that lay people can understand how it does or does not apply to evolution . 	0
WTP	640	If the answer to both questions is " yes , " then I think we shoulod keep in the misconception , and explain it . 	1
WTP	641	For me the questions are , ( 1 ) are these widely held misconceptions and ( 2 ) will explaining them help people understand the scientific theory of evolution and why it is so powerful and widely accepted among scientists ? 	0
WTP	642	I think the question of whether the misunderstandings are common among creationists is in and of itself irrelevant . 	1
WTP	643	Surely we all agree that it should be both accurate and accessible . 	0
WTP	644	We do not need to provide en extensive , detailed account of the second law , that belongs in the linked article . 	1
WTP	645	Let ' s distinguish between accuracy and detail . 	0
WTP	646	In this case what is important is how the 2nd law does or does not relate to evolution , and I think this is indeed an important point . 	0
WTP	647	The result will be an article that will educate a much wider circle of readers , and more effectively . 	0
WTP	648	- - 	0
WTP	649	False dichotomy . 	0
WTP	650	It ' s inappropriate and undue weight to mention BP several times and the other companies not at all when it was Transocean who owned , staffed and operated , and was responsible for , the drilling of the well and the drilling rig that exploded ( and lost 11 crew ) and it was Halliburton contractors who had done the vital job of cementing , particularly given that faulty cementing by Halliburton was alleged to be a factor in two other major blowouts . 	1
WTP	651	Both of those companies figured about as prominently as BP in several Congressional hearings , and it is conceivable that one or both will ultimately be found partly if not fully responsible for the blowout . 	0
WTP	652	It ' s undue weight and out of context if we were to mention people expressed frustration at the president without noting that there was even more frustration being expressed toward BP et al . On the other hand , it ' s similarly undue weight and out of context to note frustration and perception and not to give an adequate picture of what was really going on , either before or after , as reliably sourced , and further , to give it in a timeline as it actually happened and not as the storyline in the media has played out . 	1
WTP	653	It would be absurd to note this happened without noting BP ' s failure to stop this early , as their plan suggested they could and would ; yet at the same time , it would be inappropriate to note their failures without noting that they eventually had success in capturing a huge amount of oil , considering they were capturing absolutely none of it for over a month . 	0
WTP	654	It ' s essentially slander to keep naming BP as though they ' re the only company involved , while ignoring the other companies at the heart of this . 	0
WTP	655	I have left out Anadarko , despite the fact they own 25% of the well and 25% of the oil , and the Japanese company who owns 10% , despite the fact that more than 1 / 3 of the oil involved in this is not owned by BP , and I have left out Cameron International who manufactured the blowout protector , , as it was past the warrantee period and it has come to light that Transocean modified the BOP counter which voids Cameron ' s responsibility . 	1
WTP	656	And of course , once you ' re going to note more than one event , you need to establish a timeline Frankly , as I said when I first edited this section , I don ' t think any of this is really relevant to this bio yet . 	1
WTP	657	Will it ultimately lead to a major shift in energy policy , or a major environmental and engineering response ? 	0
WTP	658	In a nutshell , I ' d propose this : We can include any topic that has been called PS by a reliable source ( whether or not said source is " right " or reflects a majority scientific view ) . 	1
WTP	659	As long as a sourced view is significant enough to be mentioned in a topic ' s article , it should suffice here . 	0
WTP	660	( Tiny minority views such as " Darwinism is a pseudoscience " would be mentioned neither here nor in Darwinism . ) 	0

WTP	663	I ' ll admit it has less than the Sabbath albums before it , but it still very much holds onto the blues . 	0

WTP	669	" About it having heavy blues undertones spanning the rest of the album is mere crap , and you know it , such rhetorical filling is unnecessary . " 	0
WTP	670	Not crap , truth . 	0
WTP	671	Actually , by that same logic Uriah Heep ' s debut would be the first progressive metal album . 	0
WTP	672	Frankly , I think actually classifying the album itself ( Sabbath Bloody Sabbath ) as " progressive metal " is rather drastic , despite the current state of Wiki ' s article on it . 	0
WTP	673	While we ' re housecleaning polls , can somebody explain why the Siena College poll , currently at the end of the section , belongs here in its current form ? 	0
WTP	674	The only cited reference is the poll release from Siena itself , so noteworthiness can be legitimately questioned . 	0

WTP	676	One does not need to look hard to find reliable recent articles detailing the trouble of the Catholic church worldwide as an organization rather than as a collection of a few sinful individuals . 	0

WTP	678	This does not exonerate the Catholic Church but I think it indicates more of a cultural problem that can not be discounted . 	1
WTP	679	The US Dept of Education report also found that in order to avoid bad press , the principals of the schools where the abuse happened would often not report the abuse or prosecute the teacher but allowed them to be transferred to new schools . 	0
WTP	680	Such figures led her to contend " the physical sexual abuse of students in schools is likely more than 100 times the abuse by priests . " 	0
WTP	681	That compares with about five decades of cases of abusive priests . 	0
WTP	682	Extrapolating data from the latter , she estimated roughly 290 , 000 students experienced some sort of physical sexual abuse by a school employee from a single decade — 1991-2000 . 	0
WTP	683	To support her contention , Shakeshaft compared the priest abuse data with data collected in a national survey for the American Association of University Women Educational Foundation in 2000 . 	0
WTP	684	" So we think the Catholic Church has a problem ? " she told industry newspaper Education Week in a March 10 interview . 	0
WTP	685	Charol Shakeshaft , the Hofstra University scholar who prepared the report , said the number of abuse cases — which range from unwanted sexual comments to rape — could be much higher . 	0
WTP	686	According to a draft report commissioned by the U . S . Department of Education , in compliance with the 2002 " No Child Left Behind " act signed into law by President Bush , between 6 percent and 10 percent of public school children across the country have been sexually abused or harassed by school employees and teachers . 	0
WTP	687	" Now , on the heels of the Catholic abuse scandal comes another of historic proportions — one that has the potential to be much greater and far-reaching . 	0

WTP	694	We used to think it ' s when your heart stops , cardiac arrest , but even someone with no blood pressure ' s brain still functions until either they are resuscitated or their brain ceases . 	0
WTP	695	This is what I wondered about , when are you truly 100% dead ? 	0

WTP	774	A century and a few decades later , the article about Cole , when combined with the other article supporting Smith ' s claim to have seen heavenly visions , his Anti-Mormon voice provides credibility to the idea that Smith told people about his vision before the Church was established in 1830 . 	0

WTP	812	Rather it relies on the fact that all organisms have commonalities to them which are best explained by a common ancestor ( such as nucleotides , cell membrane , chirality of amino acids , genetic code ) ; notice that none of these can be used to create a phyloenetic tree of biodiversity as they are present in ' all organisms in the exact same state ( there are exeptions of course , but they are minor ) . 	0

WTP	957	Of the 47 articles labeled that were not labeled as stubs ( and there were several that * should * have been so labeled , but were not , and are still included in the 47 ) , 20 included detailed depictions of the related surgery , whether it be a medical diagram of the procedure , a diagram or image of the tumor / organ to be removed / destroyed , a photograph of the surgery in progress , or a photo of the result ( e . g . a vagina after clitoridectomy , or a post - amputation human hand ) . 	0

WTP	966	Authorities in science which make comments on pseudoscience are not pseudoscientific themselves . 	0

WTP	991	What we have to remember is that this is not a list of pseudosciences , but rather a collection of topics which have been characterized as pseudoscience by some notable source . 	0
WTP	992	Does that make sense ? 	0
WTP	993	I think with proper attribution and context ( historical , academic , etc . ) , we can include items which even in our heart of hearts know are not pseudoscientific and there won ' t be any NPOV problems with this article . 	0
WTP	994	Being included in this list means not that the item is pseudoscientific , but rather that it has the unique distinction of having been called pseudoscientific by some notable source . 	0

WTP	997	Some of us seem to be making a judgment based on our own views of what is and what isn ' t pseudoscience , and we feel that it is wrong to mention psychoanalysis in the same breath as phrenology . 	0

WTP	1008	Moreover , Wikifan is quite right about not having such sections for other armies . 	0
WTP	1009	I bet some Wikipedians would like that , but this would not lead to a balanced article . 	0
WTP	1010	If you can find such sources , it would be interesting to have a look , but if we including the Liberty incident , we might as well have a 100-page controversy section detailing every screw-up the IDF has ever made . 	0
WTP	1011	I ' ve read a few books on general IDF history ( as opposed to specific episodes ) , and none of them talk in-depth about the USS Liberty incident or attribute it significance in the long term . 	0
WTP	1012	However , from an historical point of view , it ' s a fairly small incident that had almost no influence on anything . 	1
WTP	1013	The USS Liberty incident is well-known because it was one of the greatest friendly fire debacles in Israeli history and also as one of the main US-related incidents in IDF history . 	0

WTP	1026	" In the past there were varying levels of belief in a flat Earth , but this was displaced by the concept of a spherical Earth due to observation and circumnavigation . 	0
WTP	1027	The human perspective regarding the Earth has changed following the advent of spaceflight , and the biosphere is now widely viewed from a globally integrated perspective . 	0
WTP	1028	This is reflected in a growing environmental movement that is concerned about humankind ' s effects on the planet . " 	0

WTP	1034	So , in fact , source reliability comes down to whether or not the source is trustworthy at representing the characterization reliably . 	0
WTP	1035	The lead even states that some of the items included in this list are not necessarily pseudoscientific , but merely have been characterized as such by some notable source . 	0
WTP	1036	Characterize , in terms of the inclusion criteria in the lead of this article , is weaker than definitively labelling something . 	0
WTP	1037	We are no longer just looking for sources which are regarded as trustworthy / authoritative in terms of definitively naming topics which are and aren ' t pseudoscience , but rather just looking for notable sources which are regarded as trustworthy / authoritative in terms of characterizing topics as pseudoscience . 	1
WTP	1038	So , in terms of WP : RS , our focus has shifted from the article which I described in the paragraph above . 	0
WTP	1039	For instead of relying on sources which satisfy PSCI and can be used to definitively call something pseudoscience , we allow for merely notable sources which have in some way , shape , or form characterized an item as pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	1040	This is what we are currently working with - a list with grey inclusionary criteria . 	0
WTP	1041	Grey comes in when this article ceases being a " List of pseudosciences " and instead is a " List of topics characterized as pseudoscience " . 	0
WTP	1042	Now where does the " grey " come in ? 	0
WTP	1043	Does that make sense ? 	0
WTP	1044	What ' s the problem now ? 	0
WTP	1045	One way the other side of that argument makes its case is to point to Israel making exactly the same charge against Hezbollah and showing how that was received / resolved . 	0

WTP	1050	There is a lot more to the subject than that , and images don ' t have to be of dead bodies themselves . 	1

WTP	1052	I think people are intelligent enough to make the connection between Atilla the Hun charging into Rome and there being some death here and there - if there wasn ' t I ' m awfully confused as to why they have all those weapons , and why they are in such a hurry . 	0
WTP	1053	The fact that it ' s difficult to sucessfully falsify , and no-one ' s done it , doesn ' t make it pseudoscience by any stretch . 	0

WTP	1082	How is it that I ' m saying Hamas " . . . isn ' t targeting cvilians " ? ? ? ? 	0
WTP	1083	I only add that the U . S . , israel and almost every other country that has waged war in history , targets civlians AS WELL ( as per the definitions of the Geneva Conventions ) , so it is only fair to use the term " employing terrorist tactics " on the " Hamas " wiki page ONLY if the same standards are used on the wiki pages of other governing bodies who have been shown to " employ " the same " tactics " . 	0
WTP	1084	As my statement ( and supporting references of the Geneva Convention articles and news sources ) clearly show that I DO believe Hamas targets civlians . … … 	1

WTP	1089	one cannot exist without the other and if one exists so does the other . 	0
WTP	1090	by definition and as declared by the zionist congress , a zionist entity and a zionist regime can only exist in the land of zion , palestine / israel and if one doesnt exist how can another ? 	0
WTP	1091	However , the section is now light years ahead of what it used to be before the rewrite , and I ' d prefer it if we didn ' t slowly work to return it to the very poor condition it was in . 	0
WTP	1092	It is true that I unilaterally picked what should be mentioned , taking into account scale , significance , and pratical prose / style concerns . 	0
WTP	1093	It is recentism and shouldn ' t be there . 	1
WTP	1094	Why it shouldn ' t be there : as much as the conflict seems significant , it actually does not appear to be that important in an historical perspective , the way we should be looking at the article . 	0
WTP	1095	It appears that a reference to the recent conflict in Gaza keeps being re-added at a rate of once per 2 days or so . 	0

WTP	1116	Anyway , comparing Operation Cast Lead to the Second Lebanon War is clueless at best . 	1
WTP	1117	It follows a recent trend in worldwide media to assess the scale of a conflict by civilian casualties , which , indeed , is completely irrelevant . 	0
WTP	1118	The Second Lebanon War was far larger in scale , both military and political . 	0
WTP	1119	But forget that ; the real problem with adding this " war " is that it ' s not even a war . 	1
WTP	1120	Aside from the media , there is no evidence that the historical record refers to it as a war ; it is simply recentism . 	0
WTP	1121	Comparetively , Operation Defensive Shield was also referred to as a war by many media sources , and probably Operation Litani ( although I wasn ' t alive then and so couldn ' t follow the media ) . 	0
WTP	1122	In addition , Israel very clear defines what is a war and what isn ' t , so at least the first instance of the addition , which clearly refers to " Israel ' s wars " , shouldn ' t be there . 	0
WTP	1123	In light of the above , I have two very important questions for you , which I request that you ( and anyone else wishing to add information about Cast Lead to this article ) address : — 	0

WTP	1129	I certainly hope , along with many others , that this finding will lead to a true cure for HIV infection . 	0
WTP	1130	At the same time , our enthusiasm for this report must be tempered by a realistic view of both the history of sensational announcements in HIV research and our goals at Wikipedia . 	1
WTP	1131	From time to time , we see a report on the nightly news that HIV infection or AIDS has been " cured " . 	1
WTP	1132	The recent announcement by Gero Hütter , first in the media and later as a case report in the NEJM , is quite notable and also very encouraging . 	0

WTP	1159	And I mean that nobody cares what Scientology thinks about science , because everybody knows that it ' s all distorsions based on their POV with no relation to reality , and that those distorsions have achieved no relevance or influence out of the context of Scientology , ok ? 	0

WTP	1164	That reference from Buchbinder clearly notes that 8% of its subjects were long-term healthy HIV-positives 10 years after infection . 	0
WTP	1165	The reference currently in the article , from Buchbinder et al 1994 , is at worst four years more recent . 	0
WTP	1166	The quoted portion of that Abbott report is old material - - it is simply a summary of research of Taylor et al 1986 and Rutherford et al 1990 . 	0
WTP	1167	Neuromancer , if you ' re taking the Abbott report from 2006 as a newer reference , I don ' t think that ' s quite sound . 	1
WTP	1168	It would be good to explain this later in this article . 	1
WTP	1169	What accounts for that counter-intuitive 20% drop in the HIV - > AIDS progression rate from the subjects infected 10 and 15 years prior ? 	0
WTP	1170	This is slightly confusing ( at least to me ) because the abstract also mentions that only 68% of HIV-positive subjects infected 14 years prior progressed to AIDS . 	0
WTP	1171	Thus , 92% - - about 9 out of every 10 - - of the HIV-positive subjects progressed to AIDS within 10 years of infection . 	1
WTP	1172	After all , wiki is about information . 	0
WTP	1173	Taken from Earth " Creation myths in many religions recall a story involving the creation of the Earth by a supernatural deity or deities . 	0
WTP	1174	A variety of religious groups , often associated with fundamentalist branches of Protestantism or Islam , assert that their interpretations of these creation myths in sacred texts are literal truth and should be considered alongside or replace conventional scientific accounts of the formation of the Earth and the origin and development of life . 	0
WTP	1175	If someone believes that the earth and everything on it was created in seven days , they are not called an " evolution denialist . " 	0
WTP	1176	Denialist of course not being a real word and created only regarding the controversy behind HIV and AIDS , and used to describe those who dissent on the generally accepted theory of HIV = AIDS = DEATH . 	0

WTP	1184	With regards to this edit : I planned to simply trim it and then put the bulk of it in the South Park controversies Then I realized it was copied word-for word from the source , and was wondering if a few vague threats from a handful of users on the website mentioned in the source was really notable enough to be deemed a " controversy " yet . 	0

WTP	1186	Is RevolutionIslam . com notable enough to be given coverage in this article ? 	0

WTP	1188	It ' s not ROS ' fault that the truth IS shocking , and his suggestion shouldn ' t necessarily be shot down for it . 	0
WTP	1189	If there is a crowded street in Calcutta with starving children , although it contains " shock value " to see it , it ' s the truth , isn ' t it ? 	0
WTP	1190	So I think they ' re fair as they are . 	0
WTP	1191	And in regard to the two pictures already up in the abortion debate section , although the editor wanted a " better quality " picture for the pro-choice representation , one could also argue that the pro-life representation contains about three people , while the pro-choice one is a sea of people . 	0
WTP	1192	Just because Ros has a blatant anti-abortion bias does not mean that his argument has no value . 	0
WTP	1193	I think both sides of the debate here have very good points , and I would like to see what Ros might come up with . 	0
WTP	1194	If a picture that accurately represents an abortion - or perhaps one being performed ( he does mention abortion procedures in his first post ) - can actually be agreed upon by a majority as something worthwhile , I don ' t see a problem with it being added . 	0

WTP	1205	I think we need to only include those parodies that have reliable sources for them , or are from well known sources . 	0
WTP	1206	" Sad Kermit " has been mentioned in at least two major newspapers , and the " Family Guy " parodies qualify as they ' re from a major TV series so they both qualify . 	1

WTP	1210	Ultrasound . 	1
WTP	1211	I think not . 	0
WTP	1212	Nonetheless , we seem to have acheived a consensus : more illustrative images would be a good thing , but " shock " pictures will not be accepted unless the article somehow directly concerns such images ( e . g . in the pro-life article , perhaps ) . 	0
WTP	1213	The article on amputation shows a hand minus two fingers . 	0
WTP	1214	Should that picture be moved to the hand article ? 	0
WTP	1215	I noticed this change to the article " In fact recent research has calculated that only one per cent of those convicted by Inquisition tribunals eventually received death penalties " A previous source used said that 3-4% of those convicted in the Spanish Inquision were executed . 	0
WTP	1216	1% may be accurate over all of the Inquisitions , but I think this will need to be made more clear , since the previous sentences detail the Spanish Inquisition . 	1

WTP	1219	Roland Deschain : I did not mean that the net energy output of the sun is zero . 	1
WTP	1220	Instead , I meant that the net energy gain of the earth is zero . 	0
WTP	1221	I ' m sorry , I think I didn ' t explain it properly . . . 	0
WTP	1222	The current sentence says " The Sun provides a large amount of energy to the Earth , and this flow of heat results in huge increases in entropy " - which is true but it ignores the fact that the earth is emitting all of this energy back into space . 	0
WTP	1223	The point of all of this is that since the net effect is an increase in entropy outside of the earth , the earth can " afford " to lose entropy without violating the second law . 	0
WTP	1224	Therefore the " entropy argument " by the creationists is faulty . 	1
WTP	1225	All energy taken in from the sun is emitted back out into space . 	0
WTP	1226	The net effect of this is a net increase of entropy in the system that includes the sun and the space , and that ' s what I meant by saying that the sun is a " source of negative energy " . . . 	0

WTP	1231	I am not sure about why this might be considered to be undue weight . 	0
WTP	1232	The IDF , rightly in my view , has a history of claiming the high moral ground in its general conduct , with abuses being unusual rather than the norm . 	0

WTP	1265	Well Roland i am glad about your contribution , given the FACT that i defined what i meant with scientific fact , and what its definition is , namely " facts ( = scientific consensus ) " i think you merely contributed in an additive fashion by reciting the definition of what scientific concensus means . 	1
WTP	1266	Cool . 	0
WTP	1267	It would be a yes or a no situation - or as I say above - it would be a black-or-white situation . 	0
WTP	1268	Either we have sources which verify that the scientific community generally considers a topic pseudoscience or we do not ; and that determines whether we would include it in such a list or not . 	0
WTP	1269	This means that these sources represent the general consideration of the scientific community . 	0
WTP	1270	I was saying that if a source is regarded as trustworthy / authoritative in terms of definitively naming topics which are and aren ' t pseudoscience ( a reliable source for describing what is and what isn ' t pseudoscience ) , then in terms of Wikipedia these sources satisy WP : PSCI and we can use them to definitively describe a topic as pseudoscientific . 	0
WTP	1271	I definitely wasn ' t calling any sources " pseudoscientific " . 	1
WTP	1272	@Sifaka - As you suspected , you misunderstood what I wrote ; probably because my language wasn ' t clear . 	0
WTP	1273	We could call this " List of pseudosciences " where either an item is clearly pseudoscience and it is included or it is not clearly pseudoscience and it is not included . 	0
WTP	1274	There would be no need for " characterized " in the title of this list , because per PSCI , we can definitively label items as " pseudoscience " if the sources show that the item is generally considered pseudoscience by the scientific community . 	1
WTP	1275	If all we were using in this article were these kinds of sources , then we would not merely be listing items that have been " characterized " as pseudoscience , but rather listing items that are pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	1276	I would imagine that these sources include highly-regarded scientific journals and various academies of science . 	0
WTP	1277	One of the reforms of the Council of Trent was regarding education for priests so we should have something - I think - in the article that establishes the Catholic Church requirements - even if it is to the bishops discretion up to a point which I think it is . 	1

WTP	1283	I don ' t think it ' s fair to have one image of a few pro-life activists and another image of a huge crowd of pro-choice activists . 	0

WTP	1301	But the title of " First Lady " reflects on the social duties of being " Lady of the house " . 	0
WTP	1302	First Gentleman is a good guess , and is pleasing to the ear due to the assumed balance between " Lady " and " Gentlemen " . 	0

WTP	1326	Especially when the Church stance is clearly outlined to respect and accept them . 	0

WTP	1328	- 	0
WTP	1329	That would fail to mention that the Church is pro-life in regards to abortion , contraception and euthanasia though , which I feel is important to point out if we ' re going to directly address those issues . 	0
WTP	1330	It would also fail to mention that the sexual abuse scandal is condemd by Catholic thought just as much as secular thought . 	0

WTP	1333	I am going to make mention of the fact that the Inquistions were not as bad as people have been led to believe via Protestant propaganda because this fact is mentioned in three of my best scholarly works and I think it is anti-Catholic POV to not mention this important fact . 	1
WTP	1334	This is why the Geneva Conventions clearly state that any use of a " protected " place for military purposes strips it of those protections , and the presence of " protected persons " , i . e civilians , does not prevent a legal attack . 	0
WTP	1335	Your " reasoning " regarding this issue is your own fringe opinion , contradicting the accepted rules of warfare . 	0
WTP	1336	By including the information to justify Mary ' s actions but NOT the information to justify Elizabeth ' s , the article displays a pro-Catholic POV . 	1
WTP	1337	Catholic Spain wanted to invade England to restore Catholicism and some of her own Catholic subjects launched plots to try to overthrow her . 	0

WTP	1723	The article should mention that Smith said he saw God and Jesus and that seems to me to be appropriate . 	0
WTP	1724	The phrasing of the source Rockgenre provided isn ' t really clear either way , although from the context the author seems to be arguing that System of a Down is an atypical nu metal band , not that they aren ' t nu metal . 	0

WTP	1823	Otherwise , it starts to raise eyebrows , like you ' re pushing your own POV instead of paying attention to accuracy and flow . 	0
WTP	1824	The thing here in my view is that these need to be valid possibilities that have been conjectured by someone whose opinion is relevant ( for one example , a former White House protocol officer ) . 	0
WTP	1825	It bothers me because it ' s far too specific for this article . 	0
WTP	1826	On occasion , yes Hamas has said that , though they also have said they would accept a state within the Green line in exchange for a long term truce . 	0
WTP	1827	Im sure we could find a way to clarify the meaning of what it is they fight for . 	0

WTP	1833	You may be right about Deep Purple ' s critical status , though . ( 	0
WTP	1834	There ' s no need to have an image from a controversial ongoing war that is likely to cause edit wars between people who want or don ' t want the image for one reason or another . 	0
WTP	1835	I strongly suggest using an image from a war that didn ' t involve America ( the graves from the American civil war is enough ) and preferably one from long enough ago that it won ' t cause any edit disputes - the Mongol invasions for example . 	0
WTP	1836	I don ' t think it ' s a valid point that it ' s small - would it be okay to have a thumbnail of a detailed photograph of two people enthusiastically copulating on the sexual intercourse article if you couldn ' t see their genitalia in the thumbnail ? 	1

WTP	1844	When pseudoscientists are considered " skeptical " , then we are in the land of pseudoskepticism . 	0
WTP	1845	When believers in " pseudoscience " ( = fake science ) show " skepticism " of mainstream positions and science , they are often engaging in pseudoskepticism ( = fake skepticism ) . 	0
WTP	1846	That ' s what is understood by the terms , and when Scientology and other fringe groups and individuals criticize mainstream positions , they can ' t be trusted , and should definitely not be used as sources here . 	1
WTP	1847	That would be a total twisting of the idea behind this list . 	0
WTP	1848	It must not become a " list of topics characterized as pseudoscience by pseudoskeptical groups and individuals " . 	0

WTP	1856	For as many users who want to portray Hamas in a " good light " there are many more users who want to try and portray them in a " bad light " , and too few who just want to say who they are and what they do and not put their own spin on it . 	0

WTP	1858	I am one of many editors - not just Roland - who believe that this article must distinguish clearly between evolution as fact ( e . g . measurable changes in the the descendents of hawthorne flies ) versus evolution as theory ( a set of concepts for understanding how and why these changes are occuring , and why they are important ) . 	0
WTP	1859	Yes , facts are constituted through scientific consensus ( see Latour and Woolgar ´ s superb ethnography , Laboratory Life ) . 	0
WTP	1860	The reason for this apparent dispute is that Slicky is not using English very precisely . 	1
WTP	1861	Moreover , Slicky muddied the waters by naming General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics as facts . 	0
WTP	1862	But this is an inadequate ( necessary but insufficient ) definition of " fact " as it is true of paradigms as well . 	0
WTP	1863	They are theories or paradigms which themselves depend on certain facts . 	0
WTP	1864	they are not . 	0
WTP	1865	That both depend on scientific consensus does not make them the same , it only means they have ( at least ) one point of congruity . 	0

WTP	1877	Simply put , the claim , by Montaignier , is that it is possible to get rid of the infection with a good immune system , and this , made by someone of the stature of Montaignier , deserves a mention , perhaps in the treatment section . 	0
WTP	1878	Whether his conclusions are correct or not , or shared by anyone else , needs to be contextualised , but claims such as these by Montagnier need to appear in the article . 	1

WTP	1915	Ronabop ' s comment was snarky , but I didn ' t find it particularly uncivil , probably because I interpreted it as a generally sarcastic remark rather than a direct personal attack . 	1
WTP	1916	Specifically , I was reprimanding Somnobot ' s " quit whining " comment , which was patently uncivil , and Talv ' s " I can tell you have an agenda you ' re attempting to push " comment , which I found mildly , but inappropriately , accusatory in nature ( see WP : AGF ) . 	0

WTP	1970	It ' s only " unproven " to the extent that any empirical claim will always remain formally unproven ( see Falsifiability ) ; to label it as such in the lead only places undue weight on an extreme minority viewpoint , even when the medical consensus is still acknowledged . 	0

WTP	2282	User : MusicInTheHouse you stated the flag makes no benefit to the article . 	0

WTP	2285	In what way does the Irish Tri-Colour make any benefit to the article any more than the UK flag would ? 	0

WTP	2287	Nor is the Irish Tri-Colour , at all . 	0

WTP	2292	Wikipedia is not a gladiatorial venue for sorting out personal prejudices , however much it sometimes seems to be like that . 	0

WTP	2305	The phrase as it has been preserved in recent edits reads : " The Roman Catholic Church , often referred to as the Catholic Church . . . " 	0
WTP	2306	This is always going to be a bone of contention , and it will produce constant " edit wars " for as long as the present construction is stuck to . 	0
WTP	2307	Multiple editors have altered it , mainly because the current format is considered misleading by many Catholics . 	0
WTP	2308	A second point is the first sentence of the article . 	0
WTP	2309	I would suggest something like : " The Roman Catholic Church , more officially termed the Catholic Church … " 	1
WTP	2310	Assuming that the article title remains Roman Catholic Church , the first sentence still needs changing in order to be less misleading , and even offensive to some Catholics . 	1
WTP	2311	The problem here is that what has become the current construction implies ( wrongly ) that the official name of the Church is the Roman Catholic Church , and Catholic Church is an unofficial term . 	0
WTP	2312	The most recent edit has put : " The Catholic Church , often referred to by protestants as the Roman Catholic Church . . . " 	0
WTP	2313	I too am a musician , though I admittedly doubt that I ' m as studied as you say you are . 	0

WTP	2328	I don ' t think that the relevancy of an issue can be judged from the apparent turnout in a picture of an isolated protest . 	1
WTP	2329	Another user above expressed the concern that the younger age of the pro-life demonstrators in the photo makes the pro-choice cause appear less current . 	0
WTP	2330	I think the issue is one of scale : the pro-life demonstration is by Bound for Life , a grassroots organization , while the pro-choice image depicts activists at the March for Women ' s Lives . 	0
WTP	2331	Saying he " dictated " the Book of Mormon is a fairly neutral representation of what Smith did , and it takes no position on whether he was " translating " in a scientific sense , receiving text by revelation , or making it up as he went , all 3 of which are theoretically possible . 	1
WTP	2332	Highlighting one of those options or opinions , that it was " translated by the gift and power of God " , is not that important in the context of the sentence as a whole . 	0

WTP	2348	If something needs to be sacrificed at the Good Article altar , my suggestion is that we reduce the epidemiological information ( much of paragraph 3 ) to about a sentence , and combine it with paragraph 4 . 	1
WTP	2349	Specifically , those who assert that it is too long should state what information there is superfluous or in some way detracts from the goal of the lede being a readable overview . 	0

WTP	2356	The soft parts can be compared to the soft parts of an Opeth or Tool song ( both bands two prominent prog metal bands , heavily influenced by Sabbath and especially this album with its innovative heavy / soft approach ) , which , also , hold no blues influences . 	0
WTP	2357	They contain no blues influences at all , basically , and your already stated example is , as said , very poor . 	0
WTP	2358	The softer parts are soft ; neither the chord progressions , the song melodies , the guitar licks , or anything , contain any clear blues influences . 	0
WTP	2359	I wouldn ' t accept that sentence , among other reasons because Hamas is also fighting against the Israeli occupation of what we call Israel , which is not Palestinian land . 	1

WTP	2364	It is very unfair to all of the faithful , hardworking and self-sacrificing priests out there who are suffering from this misconception and my heart really hurts for them . 	0
WTP	2365	The church response and reforms were not covered by the press hardly at all and I think the aricle serves the public interest by making that known . 	0
WTP	2366	Reasons why I think sex scandals should be mentioned in the lead : I think the article ' s section covering the sex abuse scandal is one of the most important ones because of the recent controversy and press coverage over it . 	1

WTP	2373	We can ' t eliminate those facts from the article without violating FA rules that require us to make mention of notable events . 	0
WTP	2374	Just as the Inquisitions are mentioned and the facts relating to the persecution of heretics is provided , so we have given equal treatment to all other persecutions relevant to the Catholic Church . 	0
WTP	2375	I would like to elaborate further on how this article is NPOV . 	0
WTP	2376	The facts regarding the persecutions of Catholics in England , Ireland and Wales are relevant facts that speak directly about the Catholic Church - how it was banned in those areas and people who resisted were dealt with in a particular way - persecutions . 	0

WTP	2414	where ' s the controversy ? 	0
WTP	2415	And if we ' re talking about the Spanish Inquisition , and giving figures , then it is important to note that most of the Inquisition killings occurred in a twenty year period when the Inquisition was run by Torquemada and it was involved in the campaign against supposed false Moorish conversos under Ferdinand and Isabella . 	0
WTP	2416	Pope SIxtus condemned the Spanish Inquisitions procedures at this time , but was brow-beaten by Ferdinand into saying nothing more . 	0
WTP	2417	It could imply thst everyone tsken in by the inquisition was killed . 	0
WTP	2418	In fact the 3-4 , 000 figure is across the Spanish Empire , and over a period of 400 years . 	0

WTP	2560	As I ' ve explained , their method of willful , intentional killing of civilians is the most salient and important detail about them . 	1
WTP	2561	I didn ' t say " Hamas is a terrorist organization " ( though it is ) , but that it employs clear-cut terrorist tactics , which is 100% true and accurate , and not open to interpretation . 	0
WTP	2562	My position is to NOT BELIEVE ANY OF THEM -U . S . , israel , Hamas , PLO , South Africa , Canada , etc . It ' s not a secret that politicians lie … . . 	0

WTP	2567	@ " Okedem " I ' m sorry . . . . 	0
WTP	2568	Therefore , I repeat again , can you tell me why it is fair , balanced and logical to include the " terrorist " comment on the " Hamas " wiki page ( in the initial description ) whereas it is apparently not on the " U . S . " and " israel " wiki page ? 	0

WTP	2570	( and please don ' t refer me to the comments made by U .

WTP	2573	The first sentence of this section sounds awkward ( ask an editor who is not involved with WP and has no axe to grind about HIV ) and seems to bend over backwards to deny that anyone with any kind of biological credentials could possibly believe anything is missing from the current theory . 	0

WTP	2579	Let me start by saying I made a mistake in regard to " researchers " . 	1
WTP	2580	I had assumed from the journal citation in this section that Papadopulos was an HIV researcher . 	0
WTP	2581	It simply summarizes various viewpoints , providing a lot of nuance about why some scientists suspect cofactors , why some HIV-positive people refused treatment and then got it , why some doctors no longer deny HIV ' s role but still think something ' s incomplete . 	0
WTP	2582	So , I don ' t see a problem with POZ as a source to * report opinions * , which is basically what the first part of this section is doing , is it not ? 	1
WTP	2583	Secondary sources are actually preferable ( to my surprise ) , mainly because of usability and ease of checking . 	0
WTP	2584	POZ does not claim to be a scientific article ! 	0
WTP	2585	NPA , Ec5618 . 	0
WTP	2586	That said , Ros , there is strong precedence against shock images on this article ( Archive 14 , " Link to ' Aborted Children ' " , Archive 16 , " Linking to Images is Allowed " , Archive 20 , " Abortion Images / Links " . 	1
WTP	2587	Such images , in the context of the politically-charged Abortion article , would be more argumentative than informative — a violation of WP : NPOV . 	0

WTP	2591	The Sea People are assumed to have had the most impact on the coasts . 	0
WTP	2592	The current coastal people are genetically highly similar to their inland neighbors . 	0
WTP	2593	This misses the point . 	0
WTP	2594	In order to determine that a given population ' s genetic pool lacks a significant contribution from some other given population , one needs to know first what characterizes the genes of that other population - - in this case , the " Sea People . " 	0
WTP	2595	This is what " Tomer " means by knowing who they were . 	0
WTP	2596	As the genetic character of the Sea People cannot be be determined , screening definitively for it seems impossible . 	1
WTP	2597	Therefore it is unlikely the coastal people interbred with any outsiders to a greater degree than the inland people did . 	0
WTP	2598	While stronger , that still isn ' t a lock . 	1
WTP	2599	The tag ( s ) seem to have been removed ( probably correctly ) because the reasons for adding the tag are no applicable to the tag , or are unarticulated ( or poorly articulated ) or discussed and removed - much like many other articles in WP in fact . 	0
WTP	2600	Just because people disagree with the article doesn ' t mean it needs a tag . 	0
WTP	2601	At one time the point was to put priests on par with doctors , lawyers , etc . I ' ve been told that it has been loosened up in various dioceses , states , countries , etc . Some seminaries in the midwest are even non-accredited . 	0

WTP	2618	Indeed there was a broad consensus , but to be more precise , it was to make the title NPOV and to bring it into harmony with the existing inclusion criteria and existing contents . 	0

WTP	2707	" Legendary " and " historical " do not show that Santa is a fable , a myth . 	1
WTP	2708	While we cannot ignore the historical underpinnings of the character , we cannot - with respect to those who believe wholeheartedly in the Flying Fat Man - escape that the wacky stories and abilities attributed to the fellow are beyond those of mortal men . 	0
WTP	2709	Much like the aforementioned example of the Easter Bunny , Santa is a mythical character . 	1
WTP	2710	However , the greater part of the character is fantastical , with enough powers and abilities to make Superman envious . 	0
WTP	2711	1 Santa has a roughly factual grounding with some embellishment , like Abe Lincoln or Johnny Appleseed ; this makes the character legendary . 	0
WTP	2712	An endorsement of LDS theology like this is not acceptable under the WP : NPOV rule . 	0
WTP	2713	In addition , whether or not the AAF is a reliable source is not the question--the issue is whether or a link to their website is a reliable source . 	0

WTP	2715	Therefore , I think that mythological is the best we are going to get , when the clear alternative would be to scientifically dismiss the character as an indigestion-inspired hallucination ( " more gravy than grave to it " , to paraphrase Scrooge ) . 	0
WTP	2716	As to citing the LDS website , such citations are generally only appropriate in order to document official LDS positions or perspectives . 	0
WTP	2717	To show the " truth " of something , it is more problemmatic , and you would want to cite something that has been peer reviewed . 	0
WTP	2718	I don ' t think it is , because we know nothing about the editorial process and any peer review other than the fact that the web page was " compiled by [ unnamed ] AAF editors " . 	1

WTP	2720	I am not claiming that it * is * pseudoscience , what I am stating is the fact that it has been characterized as being unfalsifiable , if you do not believe that this then constitutes similitude with pseudoscience I suggest you go rewriting [ Falsifiability ] and [ scientific method ] then come back here . 	1

WTP	2801	No content was removed , and nothing controversial was inserted so i i dont think there should bea fight / edit war . 	1
WTP	2802	To quote the tag line from the program : It ’ s been discovered in recent months that several bishops have tried to silence those hoping to bring sex abuse cases to light . 	0

WTP	2805	The scandals could have far-reaching consequences for the Roman Catholic church in a country which the Vatican has long regarded as a source of moral renewal for the world . 	0
WTP	2806	The section details conflicting opinions about what the most accurate and " honest " translation is . 	0
WTP	2807	This discussion produced a secondary controversy over what is the " correct " translation of the quote . 	0
WTP	2808	Out of curiosity , are you at any stage going to find the sources that back up the assertion " The sources clearly state that they are not nu metal " or can we disregard that as bluster ? 	0
WTP	2809	The official translation provided by the Iranian government is therefore immediately notable . 	0
WTP	2810	To apply this definition of disorder to the world around us will be like measuring the " power of an argument " in Watts . 	0

WTP	2816	Her daughter became Gaddafi ' s mother . 	0
WTP	2817	She ran away with a Muslim sheikh , converted to Islam . 	0
WTP	2818	In the days before the creation of Israel ( and the mass emigration of sephardic Jews from Islamic Arab countries to Israel ) it was not that unusual for a Sephardic Jewish woman to marry a Muslim man , and in fact , a Jewish ( or Christian ) woman would not be required to convert to Islam to marry a Muslim man under Islamic law ( though a Muslim woman many only marry a Muslim though she may marry a Muslim convert and a woman from another religion not considered a " people of the book " like Jews or Christians would have to convert before Islamic law will recognize the marriage ) . 	1
WTP	2819	Given the other account , that his mother converted to Islam at 9 years old , it may not be clear if his mother was from the grandmother ' s first marriage to the Jewish man or from the second marriage to the sheikh . 	0
WTP	2820	Apparently , according to the Israeli media , under Jewish halachic law , to be a Jew one must be born to a Jewish mother or convert to Judaism . 	1
WTP	2821	You are reading " psychoanalysis should not be generally characterized as pseudoscience " , which is in the text you cited . 	0
WTP	2822	If so , Gaddafi would meet the legal Islamic definition of being a Muslim , while also meeting the legal , Jewish , definition of being a Jew . 	1
WTP	2823	If born to a Jewish mother , you qualify as a Jew and at least some authorities maintain it does not matter if your mother--born Jewish--aposticizes and joins another religion . 	0
WTP	2824	I will have another look at Kamen today , and possibly make a few tweaks . 	0
WTP	2825	This article looks to me , a layman who has indirectly encountered research as a freelance editor , like a very detailed biological article that explains everything one would want to know about a virus . 	1
WTP	2826	It necessarily addresses consequences of infection , and it necessarily addresses secondary effects ( e . g . , loss of income , loss of parents ) , though I feel the latter should not be part of the lead . 	0

WTP	2840	When does the nationality of a performer ever create a genre ? 	0
WTP	2841	Here ' s a practical example ; The sub-genre of Thrash Metal breaks out mid-80s , a mostly American phenomenon . 	0
WTP	2842	Yes there are others and I ' m aware of them but can you sit here and enumerate tons of bands described as Funk Metal ? 	0
WTP	2843	Even then , most of these bands fit into the Alternative Metal category as well , maybe even more so . EDIT : Also , there ' s an argument about breaking racial boundaires ? 	0

WTP	2849	It also needs to be stated at the beginning that the Church terms itself the " Catholic Church " See for example : http://www.catholicchurch.org.uk/ 	1
WTP	2850	The point is that the Anglican Church does not officially term itself the Catholic Church and neither does the Orthodox Church , while the ( roman ) Catholic Church does do just that , and has done so from earliest times . 	0
WTP	2851	The term Roman Catholic Church is largely a construct of the reformation period , when other groups wanted to claim " catholicism " . 	0
WTP	2852	The " Old Catholic Church " is known as just that - although it is not very old . 	0
WTP	2853	While " Roman Catholic Church " may be acceptable for an article title to avoid confusion . 	0
WTP	2854	I see the Germans have a statue at the top of their entry ( perhaps understandable in their case ) . 	0
WTP	2855	There is no demarcation between pseudoscience so while you can clearly distinguish between physics and cryptozoology , you will still have have boundary issues . 	0
WTP	2856	I agree that this list should become List of pseudosciences and use WP : PSCI but note that there will always be grey : you cannot avoid it . 	1

WTP	2881	Purple ' s dismissal of blues is clear , but blues is still ever-present in every album , and they don ' t take a clear step away from it like Sabbath does in " Sabbath Bloody Sabbath " . 	0
WTP	2882	The other songs are a little more similar in heaviness , but it ' s important acknowledging that Paranoid is relatively light in Sabbath ' s music , while Highway Star is particularly heavy in Purple ' s . 	0
WTP	2883	" Burn " came later , and is kind of metal , but made when the genre already was established by Sabbath . 	0
WTP	2884	" Sweet Leaf " is groundbreaking in a groundbreaking album ; notice the riffing in between the verses , and the riffs after the guitar solo ; they are but a taste of what is a norm in metal music from then on ; the breaking of common scales , and heavy usage of alternative intervals , like semitones and the tritone . 	0

WTP	2897	Our inclusion criteria define this article , not the title ( which was recently changed with explicit assurances that people would not immediately set in with pointed and disruptive additions ) . 	0

WTP	2981	You directed me to a section of the NPOV policy dealing with undue weight , which exactly clarifies the point that I am making : " An article should not give undue weight to any aspects of the subject , but should strive to treat each aspect with a weight appropriate to its significance to the subject . 	0
WTP	2982	Our argument is about what constitutes a notable controversy in a WP article on the Roman Catholic Church , and my position is that the sex abuse scandals don ' t make the cut because so many other controversies in the church are so much more notable . 	1
WTP	2983	Given the 2000 year history of the church , and all the things associated with the church , I ' d say even a mention of the sex abuse scandals in the lead is undue weight , based on prominence of placement . 	1
WTP	2984	Note that undue weight can be given in several ways , including , but not limited to , depth of detail , quantity of text , prominence of placement , and juxtaposition of statements " ( emphasis added ) . 	0
WTP	2985	If the lead needs to include a contemporary controversy ( and it is not clear to me that it does ) , I understand mentioning the the sex abuse scandal , although I think that it is much more significant to the Roman Catholic Church , and much more encyclopedia-worthy , to include the debates around the implementation of Summorum Pontificum . 	0

WTP	3037	So if I personally were describing corrupt abominable people , I might use the word ' sect ' also . 	0
WTP	3038	One thing to consider is that Joseph Smith declares that the dispensation that he proclaims is a restoration of the Truth , and for everyone else - - " all their creeds were an abomination in his sight ; that those professors were all corrupt " . 	0
WTP	3039	Either way , he said the word ' sect ' and so unless you have some clear evidence that it didn ' t mean sect , then it should say ' sect ' . 	1
WTP	3040	We can assume he knows no distinction and just switches terms constantly , or we can assume he deliberately chooses the terms . 	0
WTP	3041	So , Smith uses a lot of different terms back and forth . 	0
WTP	3042	In the lines leading up to the passage where Smith describes his experience in the official Joseph Smith-History from LDS , Smith uses various words to describe religion and religious things . 	0

WTP	3049	I happened by a statement that uses the phrase remained under British sovereignty in the context of NI . 	0
WTP	3050	This is in the Judgment of the Court of Human Rights in the " Lawless v Ireland " case in 1961 which states on page 4 of the judgment in the " As to the Facts " section : " Under the Treaty establishing the Irish Free State , signed on 6th December 1921 between the United Kingdom and the Irish Free State , six counties in the North of the Island of Ireland remained under British sovereignty . " 	0
WTP	3051	Considering that the case was defended by the then Attorney General of Ireland Aindrias Ó Caoimh one could reasonably expect the facts to be as viewed by the state itself . 	1
WTP	3052	Perhaps using that phrase would be preferable to any UK word use and you even have a decent reference to substantiate it and those are lawyers speaking . 	1
WTP	3053	I think it ' s important to recognize though that this is an area where potentially we might have compromised and - and arrived at a bill that dealt with the narrow concerns about how a - a previable fetus or child was treated by a hospital . 	0
WTP	3054	I recognize this is a passionate issue , and so I - I won ' t , as I said , belabor the point . 	0
WTP	3055	And if we ' re placing a burden on the doctor that says you have to keep alive even a previable child as long as possible and give them as much medical attention as - as is necessary to try to keep that child alive , then we ' re probably crossing the line in terms of unconstitutionality . 	0
WTP	3056	Viability is the line that has been drawn by the Supreme Court to determine whether or not an abortion can or cannot take place . 	0
WTP	3057	The second reason that it would probably be found unconstitutional is that this essentially says that a doctor is required to provide treatment to a previable child , or fetus , however way you want to describe it . 	0
WTP	3058	For that purpose , I think it would probably be found unconstitutional . 	0
WTP	3059	It was . 	0
WTP	3060	I suggested to Members of the Judiciary Committee that it was unconstitutional and it would be struck down by the Seventh Circuit . 	0

WTP	3063	Tenacious misunderstandings are quite a bit more of a problem . 	0
WTP	3064	Contentious misunderstandings — say , using an editorial argument ( and its alleged abandonment ) as a platform to criticize a page or the project as a whole , and in doing so using it as a kicking-off place for several other misunderstandings — is a different , though at this page no less common , problem . 	0

WTP	3507	So to recap , it seems like you need to explain how you ' re not running against WP : EL # ADV and WP : ELNO ' s # 4 , 10 , and 11 ; if you can ' t get any editors who regularly use Wikipedia to comment in your favour here , perhaps you should seek redress via Wikipedia : Third opinion as your last resort in getting this put to bed . 	0

WTP	3540	Indeed , I could complain about some parts of the article as it is , The section on the Reformation contains some highly critical comments : The most famous scholar of the age , Erasmus , in 1509 wrote In Praise of Folly which captured a widely held opinion about corruption in the church . [ 189 ] Abuses of power , usury , clerical wealth and hypocrisy all contributed to a general feeling among educated people that reform of some sort was necessary . [ 189 ] In 1517 , Martin Luther included his Ninety-Five Theses in a letter to several bishops , hoping to spark debate . [ 190 ] His theses protested key points of Catholic doctrine as well as the sale of indulgences . [ 190 ] Huldrych Zwingli , John Calvin , and others further criticized Catholic teachings . 	1
WTP	3541	These challenges developed into the Protestant Reformation . 	0
WTP	3542	I could object to some of this , Martin Luther inttended to spark more than debate when he posted his theses . 	0
WTP	3543	and there are none of the many negatives about him here ( anti-semitism , allowing bigamy , coercion , sanctining slaying of the peasants ) . 	0

WTP	3581	In regards to the back and forth here , I think the reasons for hesitation on inclusions of these types of things are legit , and Scjessey ' s response ( while it does look POVish ) is based on the fact that there were editors here wanting to included everything negative pushed at Obama during the first months of his presidency . 	1

WTP	3722	This is a problem that one faction of editors does not understand . 	0
WTP	3723	Both Britannica and the Encarta articles on the Church do a better job of addressing the abuse scandal in the life of the Church . 	0
WTP	3724	The article as it is written states that the abuse is a recent U . S . anomaly while plenty of serious books written from both within the Church and without give another view . 	0
WTP	3725	That other view must be in this article for it to be NPOV . 	0

WTP	3727	I would not put Cartman ' s mom in the same class of characters as SKCK , even though she has often had as much screen-time as any one of thm and is sometimes central to the plot . 	0
WTP	3728	The show has a large supporting cast of characters some of whom become more or less prominent depending on the episode - and we can through in the eight parents , and Ike , while we are at it . 	0
WTP	3729	South prk revolves around the relationshps among Stan , Kyle , Cartman and Kenny , sometimes through their separate adventures . 	0
WTP	3730	The effec is identical - so who do you think you are fooling ( except possibly yourself ) when you protest that " main " does not appear ? 	0
WTP	3731	When you removed " main " from Butters , you removed it for the other four . 	0
WTP	3732	When these characters were identified as main , you added " main " to Butters . 	0
WTP	3733	The issue is not whether or not Butters is identifid as a " main " character , the question is whether Butters is given the sam prominence as Stan , Kyle , Cartman , and Kenny . 	0
WTP	3734	MarnetteD , removing the word " main " does not resolve the question . 	1
WTP	3735	This is unacceptable . 	0

WTP	3741	It just seems to stupid to censor content that speaks no message other then " This is an abortion . " . 	1
WTP	3742	I found " Zionist Regime " and other descriptions instead . 	0
WTP	3743	I might as well address this point now : as I had said above the pictures of abortion are pretty NPOV to begin with . 	0
WTP	3744	Pictures displayed matter-of-factly that somehow evoke pity or sympathy do not mean that they can ' t ever be displayed without sharing a point ; they just draw upon innate emotions . 	0
WTP	3745	As was said above I realize this is already a touched upon issue and my comment is nothing new to the argument but I was wondering why is there no actual picture of an abortion / post aborted fetus on this page ? 	0
WTP	3746	The picture is only as POV as the messages following it as I ' ve seen many proponents of abortion openly share them and declare they are worthless appeal to emotion in the context of abortion debate . 	1
WTP	3747	Regardless , they ' re neutral outside debate and it ' s curious an entire article on ABORTION has no picture of such despite the fact they clearly exist . 	0

WTP	3753	As it happens there are items on this list that use Randi as a source , I have not really heard about the guy before today but his website doesn ' t exactly exude credibility . 	0
WTP	3754	It is still a discussion that is worth having sooner rather than later . . 	0
WTP	3755	As an aside , I seriously hope that we do not include scientology as sources regarding psychiatry , there is simply no need and it detracts from the case made by ' actual scientists and medical professionals ' . 	0
WTP	3756	Aliens in DC-10s notwithstanding , scientology have made themselves notable when they have the likes of Tom Cruise decrying psychiatry on prime-time tv . 	0
WTP	3757	This would defuse the oncoming impasse and allow readers to judge for themselves if they consider the sources authoritative . 	0
WTP	3758	I think we should consider properly attributing claims to their sources in-text . 	1
WTP	3759	As I mentioned above , there is no visible context in the picture showing that it has anything to do with either the West Bank or the Gaza Strip . 	0

WTP	3762	It is a picture of four men , two in uniform , holding rifles . 	0
WTP	3763	As such it is an excellent illustrative photo of militantism in Israeli culture or the citizen-soldier nature of the IDF but not relevant to a general article about the IDF or an article about a specific location . 	1
WTP	3764	We should consider moving the first paragraph of this section elsewhere , as well as renaming it , since the other sources are quite low-quality and the entire bit is rather crystal ball-ish . 	0

WTP	3772	The Prophet , Allah bless him and grant him salvation , has said : The Day of Judgement will not come about until Moslems fight the Jews ( killing the Jews ) , when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees . 	0
WTP	3773	The stones and trees will say O Moslems , O Abdulla , there is a Jew behind me , come and kill him . 	0
WTP	3774	Only the Gharkad tree , ( evidently a certain kind of tree ) would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews . 	0
WTP	3775	That said , I still fail to see what you ' re positing as the source of diversity . 	0
WTP	3776	Let ' s assume we mean ' speciation ' when we talk about ' diversity ' . 	0
WTP	3777	Anyway , that ' s obviously a semantic argument that ' s not worth having . 	0
WTP	3778	Drift and selection in that context act AGAINST the existing diversity , produced by mutations , and can only result in eventual fixation - that is , the elimination of variation . 	0
WTP	3779	If you just mean ' variation ' , e . g . the diversity evident within the human population , then you are wrong . 	1
WTP	3780	Also , I ' m unclear on how you ' re using ' diversity ' - if you mean strictly speciation , then I ' ll agree that drift and selection are important forces that are required to produce speciation , since one couldn ' t have fixation / divergence without them by definition . 	1
WTP	3781	I ' m unclear on what you mean . 	0
WTP	3782	I suppose I am confused , then - could you specify what these different lines of evidence are , one supporting common descent and the other supporting biodiversity ? 	0
WTP	3783	I agree that we don ' t need more discussion about editors themselves . 	0
WTP	3784	Let ' s all stick to the topic at hand . 	0
WTP	3785	Could you clarify ? 	0
WTP	3786	Yes ? 	0

WTP	3804	Not knowing exactly what a " zionist entity " was I went to the page . 	0

WTP	3905	Furthermore , some of the groups referred to by a single name in our records were composed of people of very diverse background . 	0

WTP	3929	There is therefore no better why of deciding on pseudoscience than by looking at the scientific consensus of whether someone is advocating a tenable position or not . 	1

WTP	3966	Probably editing too late at night , but I don ' t know how I could have got you two mixed up . 	0

WTP	3983	A bias to hide relevant information is sinister - and what wikipedia is NOT all about . 	0
WTP	3984	The strong desire to keep images of what an abortion is hidden speaks volumes about those who possess it . 	0
WTP	3985	The strong desire to make such images available to more people ( rather than suppressed ) is to be lauded by all who favor enlightenment and decision-making based on fully informed decision-makers . 	0
WTP	3986	I forget what the last word was . 	0
WTP	3987	Abortion is a common surgery . 	0
WTP	3988	Why would images of such a common surgery be suppressed , if not to hide what it is ? 	0
WTP	3989	How is bringing what it is to light in any way biased ? 	0
WTP	3990	A bias for more information is what wikipedia is all about . 	0
WTP	3991	Leave it - he offers no proof to support his viewpoint and his whole conclusion makes that clear . 	1
WTP	3992	Xandar , we have to show both viewpoints it is Wikipedia policy - you will end up with a useless B article if you don ' t have opposing viewpoints in your article . 	1
WTP	3993	I dont want a propaganda page , I want a factual page that will let the reader know the whole story - personally Duffy ' s comments really make him appear to be stretching his opinions and I think it makes his opinion even more unreliable . 	0
WTP	3994	Inquisitions were another area of surprise . 	0
WTP	3995	Still , this article - the Roman Catholic Church article - must mention something about the worldwide problem of abuse that has affected it as an institution . 	1
WTP	3996	I appreciate it . 	0
WTP	3997	Sorry for my poor rhetoric , although when I said - as I did above - " The scandal has been and is continuing to be exacerbated by institutional denial and documented cover ups , " I don ' t follow your misunderstanding . 	0

WTP	4005	The t-shirt controversy warrants little mention and should be moved to a more pertinent article , or removed . 	0
WTP	4006	I say we move the controversy section all together since no other Western military has one ( in spite of being far more controversial . ) 	0
WTP	4007	However , I think we will be hit over the head a few times if we dont have any controversies noted in the lead . 	0
WTP	4008	I can see your point and it makes complete sense to me . 	0
WTP	4009	- - 	0
WTP	4010	I for one do not think that the controversy / criticism section needs to be any bigger than any one of the history , structure or equipment sections . 	1
WTP	4011	There are also multiple organizations , notably Breaking the Silence , that deal specifically with this issue ( see above discussion with Deborahjay ) , and there is a main article for the recent controversy . 	0
WTP	4012	If we included even a small paragraph for every controversy of a similar scope to the recent soldiers ' testimonies , we ' d easily get a 100K section only for criticism , because there were a series of such testimonies after each major operation , and some of the notable cases are listed here . 	1
WTP	4013	If you ' re suggesting that the tone of the current article is fear-mongering , then I disagree . 	0
WTP	4014	I ' m afraid I don ' t understand your post . 	0
WTP	4015	Ditto . 	0
WTP	4016	A MVA Manual_vacuum_aspiration , with WHO ( anybody know their copyright status ? ) pictures at [ [ 9 ] ] , makes it pretty clear that even surgically induced abortions are fairly simple , and not even that interestingly graphic . 	0
WTP	4017	Mostly my sense of bemused irritation comes from folks who want to portray all natural , surgical , and pharmaceutical procedures similarly . 	0
WTP	4018	I can agree with that ( while also noting that the most widely used form of induced fertilized egg / blastocyst / fetus rejections are pharmaceutical , not surgical , in nature ) , but could that mean that the article is lopsided , or how we use pictures in the article is lopsided , or what ? 	0
WTP	4019	Ronabop , I think it ' s clear that most of the article is about induced abortion , as is most of the debate over the issue . 	0
WTP	4020	While seeing such things doesn ' t really bother me all that much ( having fed a good 20-30 fetuses to coyotes in my life , and consuming at least a few hundred . . . life on a farm an all ) , I ' m divided on how to present the subject , images , and article , properly in a NPOV manner . 	0
WTP	4021	However , I can understand their motivations , in that they are wishing to " humanize " and " personalize " , abortion , and one of the more functional tactics in that effort has been using shock images . 	0
WTP	4022	To repeat a refrain , many who have asked for ( and suggested ) pictures are * not * asking for pictures of an abortion procedure , or process , they are asking for gore pictures of a dead human fetus , which is not what this article is about , subject-wise ( Though it could be , if the article was renamed Human aborted fetuses ) . 	0
WTP	4023	There has been an attempt to build consensus for what are reasonable deviations from the US place name guideline . 	0
WTP	4024	My effort and why I believe so strongly that it should be here is because of the lack of such substance in the article . 	0
WTP	4025	I do not hide the fact that I am a practicing member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints . 	0

WTP	4043	- - 	0
WTP	4044	The statement is potentially inaccurate and certainly unwise to feature in the lead . 	0
WTP	4045	Putting this in the lead will just cause more vandalism to the article than there is now ( which is already substantial ) . 	0
WTP	4046	The lead is supposed to be a summary of the body of the article , not an independent editorial . 	0
WTP	4047	Again what were the negative aspects of the MISSIONS ? 	0
WTP	4048	Very little is said about Henry ' s persecutions - or what happened in Ireland Vague criticism . 	0
WTP	4049	Just as America points to a broader page , rather then the USA , and just like Orthodox Church points to something broader than the Eastern Orthodox Church , so too Catholic Church should follow this precedent . 	0
WTP	4050	Until you all back up your personal interpretation with Wikipedia precedence as I have , your argument has no weight . 	0
WTP	4051	I was attempting to answer what appeared to be a genuine question from a first-time poster without making incendiary remarks , not " whitewashing " anything . 	0

WTP	4055	So permanence can be the result of social factors , not just biology , but it is still permanent . 	0
WTP	4056	or equivalent to " which have been characterized as " ( a present perfect passive-voice adjectival clause ) ? 	0
WTP	4057	So I guess the issue is , roughly : Is the phrase " characterized as " equivalent to " which are characterized as " ( a present-tense passive-voice adjectival clause ) ? 	0
WTP	4058	But as I also said , I believe editors should attempt to be collectively clearer , i . e . to arrive at some kind of consensus about what the scope of the list is in this regard . 	0
WTP	4059	I ' m reasonably OK with this position too , if it turns out to be the consensus position on the scope of the list . 	0

WTP	4065	Keep in mind that guidelines for this article fall within a more rigorous subset of the WP : RS standard - - WP : MEDRS . 	0
WTP	4066	I was speaking of the article in in general , and was not directing that comment at any specific editor in any way . 	0
WTP	4067	You are mis-understanding me , I was not claiming you were trying to whitewash anything . 	1
WTP	4068	Permanence does not imply irreversibility . 	1
WTP	4069	In fact , there are no references to HIV isolation at all , and I felt it important to include this information . 	0
WTP	4070	I cited the CDC report , as well as the Gallo and Montegnier publications . 	0
WTP	4071	I can not think of a better source than the ORIGINAL papers being cited , as I did . 	0
WTP	4072	Nowhere in this Wiki are there references to the original publications claiming to have isolated HIV . 	0
WTP	4073	I also agree that there should be two separate pages : One for HIV , and another for AIDS , as while they may be intrinsically linked in the cause and effect consensus , they are NOT the same thing . 	1
WTP	4074	There are people who test HIV + who have NEVER developed AIDS and these case start in the 80 ' s . 	0
WTP	4075	If you are going to look at something , then look at it all , and the basis for this article are those three documents , and they are NOWHERE to be found in this article prior to my edits . 	0
WTP	4076	It actually took a great deal of time to locate them for inclusion . 	0
WTP	4077	Seriously , the assetions that dome is a Greek invention or rocket is a German invention are completely contradicted by the text of the articles . 	0
WTP	4078	There should also be a separate article for treatments , a separate article for dissident information . 	0
WTP	4079	It is not the place of the Wiki to hide notable information , however much one may personally disagree with it . 	0

WTP	4082	A better analogy would be showing a picture of the severed fingers alone , and no , that would not belong in the amputation article . 	0
WTP	4083	No , but the equivalent here would be a woman without a fetus in her . 	0
WTP	4084	Anyway I agree with the consensus reached here ; I just wanted to offer my opinion anyway . 	0

WTP	4088	By the way , the fact that it ' s obvious to everyone that this material exists to " debunk the creationist " 2nd law " claim " is why I think it should be moved to the section on creation vs . evolution . 	1
WTP	4089	I also agree partially , But I ' m not saying give the latest scandal , just give them the truth , many times people come to wiki for the truth , after they read some scandal within the tabloids . 	0
WTP	4090	I may add something about those if Wassupwestcoast insists on expanding on the bad - just so we have balance but I really think that such an approach will make the article too long . 	1
WTP	4091	It is a serious omission of fact to not tell the reader about the reforms . 	0
WTP	4092	These facts were referenced and need to be replaced . 	0
WTP	4093	Wassupwestcoast , there are some serious flaws in your new rewrite , references numbers 225 and 226 do not support the sentence they reference and number 226 is not a news article , it is an opinion piece which are not OK refs in Wikipedia . 	1
WTP	4094	Also , the recent audit found almost all of the diocese in compliance - there was one or two that did not meet some requirement so they failed - they were in fact doing most of the things required but not all . 	0

WTP	4098	Why exactly are you interested in this article ? 	0
WTP	4099	You don ' t seem to view the Mormonism movement as anything of value in either Christian Theology or American History . 	0
WTP	4100	And there is no evidence that any of this has to do , specifically , with Smith ' s later claim to have seen two personages . 	0
WTP	4101	We can forget about Cole ' s earlier 1830 " Book of Pukei " article which has nothing to do with this subject . 	0
WTP	4102	There are many problems with Abner Cole ' s 1831 reporting ( in Palmyra ) of a rumor ( in Ohio ) that Smith was " frequently " seeing God by 1831--something Smith never actually claimed as far as we know . 	0

WTP	4205	Unfortunately , this bill goes a little bit further , and so I just want to suggest , not that I think it ' ll make too much difference with respect to how we vote , that this is probably not going to survive constitutional scrutiny . " 	0
WTP	4206	And there was some suggestion that we might be able to craft something that might meet constitutional muster with respect to caring for fetuses or children who were delivered in this fashion . 	0
WTP	4207	" Well , it turned out - that during the testimony a number of members who are typically in favor of a woman ' s right to choose an abortion were actually sympathetic to some of the concerns that your - you raised and that were raised by witnesses in the testimony . 	0
WTP	4208	Is that correct ? " 	0
WTP	4209	And one of the concerns that came out in the testimony was the fact that they were not being properly cared for during that brief period of time that they were still living . 	0
WTP	4210	According to the IL Senate transcripts , which links I just included , Obama ' s reasons for opposing the bills can be seen as follows , from his words posted verbatim : " Senator O ' Malley , the testimony during the committee indicated that one of the key concerns was - is that there was a method of abortion , an induced abortion , where the - - the fetus or child , as - as some might describe it , is still temporarily alive outside the womb . 	0
WTP	4211	As for # 1 , if you mean Obama was opposing the bills on state ' s rights , then you ' re wrong , and I ' m not sure where you are getting your sources . 	1
WTP	4212	I mean , it - it would essentially bar abortions , because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child , then this would be an antiabortion statute . 	0
WTP	4213	That determination then , essentially , if it was accepted by a court , would forbid abortions to take place . 	0

WTP	4223	They have one foot in the hard rock genre , and the other in the blues genre , together with the influences you mention , and I would hesitantly include heavy metal among those influences , because none of their albums are actual heavy metal ; they don ' t have it as an overhanging concept , but they do have heavy metal-ish ( I ' d say hard rock ) songs in their albums , like " Whole Lotta Love " and " Immigrant Song " . 	0

WTP	4415	Of course they take their view of Catholicism from a sensationalistic press rather than going to the source which says a homosexual must be treated with respect , compassion and sensitivity , also unjust disrcimination against them is wrong . 	0

WTP	4420	I have found in the past that no matter how notable a criticism of Obama , or how well-sourced it may be , that the editors on the Obama page will fight it tooth and nail , bringing in other liberal editors from elsewhere on Wikipedia and then claiming ' consensus ' regardless of past editors who provided opposite consensus who just aren ' t present at the time . 	1

WTP	4426	As to confusing , while BP is , as you say , the operator of the well , Transocean is the operator of the rig and Transocean is the driller of the well ; it technically isn ' t an operating well until the drilling rig sails off and a production rig comes in . 	0

WTP	4428	The Macondo Prospect isn ' t a well , it ' s an oil field . 	0
WTP	4429	What blew up was something drilled for the prior couple months by Transocean ( allegedly faultily , with pieces of their BOP annulus breaking and coming up the riser pipe in chunks , indicating it was not in a condition to prevent a blowout ) and the casing sealed early that morning by Halliburton ( allegedly shoddily ; cementing problems are associated with 18 of 39 blowouts in the previous 15 years ; Halliburton admitted faulty cementing before the Montara oil spill in Australia last year ) . 	0
WTP	4430	The Deepwater Horizon is a drilling rig , known at Wikipedia as an oil platform . 	0

WTP	4448	if your answer is yes , I await your edit to the page ( as I see you have done much editing to it , and will leave it to you ) and will not argue about having this information described in the first paragraph of the " Hamas " page . 	0
WTP	4449	For example , would you agree that in the first paragraph of the " israel " wiki page , it would state that the majority of the Palestinian population and millions of other people around the world regard israel as one of the biggest terrorist states ? ? 	0
WTP	4450	No one here is opposing the idea of including the ( false ) labels that people want to attribute to Hamas , we are just asking for the same treatment as is given to other governing bodies on wikipedia . 	1
WTP	4451	Before they were elected , maybe it would have seemed logical to include this type of view in the first paragraph , but not now , since the main subject surrounding the group ( for the people it represents i . e . the Palestinians ) pertains to it ' s legal standing as a minority government . 	0
WTP	4452	Thank you for moving my comment . . . . . as for the discussion , if you agree that the wiki page for " United States " should state in the first paragraph that it is considered by millions of people around the world as the biggest terrorist state , then I see no problem in doing this with Hamas ' wiki page . 	0

WTP	4939	Karanacs , surely the idea of peer review is to get input from people who haven ' t previously been involved in editing an article ? 	0
WTP	4940	It doesn ' t read well as it is . 	0
WTP	4941	Presumably a female President would still be the hostess , but it seems ridiculous to suggest the President could also be the First Lady at the same time ( unless the US has a lesbian President , and let ' s not go there . . . ) 	0
WTP	4942	I think people are correct in saying there needs to be a distinction between the spouse of the President and the hostess at the White House . 	0

WTP	4944	Bush never dropped out of a specific church though , so the comparison really isn ' t applicable . 	1
WTP	4945	I added a line about how this was resolved in a fictitious situation : President Mackenzie Allen ' s husband is titled First Gentleman but her mother eventually joins the white house as a de facto hostess . 	0
WTP	4946	But I don ' t see why a First Gentleman couldn ' t perform all the functions of a ' hostess ' , if he was minded to do so . 	0
WTP	4947	But here is the second , and very key , point to address - who would be the " hostess of the white house " ? 	0
WTP	4948	By definition , the husband cannot be the hostess , so who would be ? 	0
WTP	4949	It is all speculation , and it will probably be decided by the mainstream press as much as by the officeholder himself . 	0
WTP	4950	" First Gentleman " seems to be the most likely candidate . 	0
WTP	4951	Remember ; first lady has two meanings , " spouse of the president " and " hostess of the whitehouse " . 	0

WTP	5002	I was simply surprised that it ' s integrated into a section about her music and that there is not a Personal life section in this article where it can go . 	0

WTP	5004	There is no justification to support a controversy section , unless I ' m missing something , right ? 	0

WTP	5008	Some people have shown impatience with the listing of Catholic positives in the article . 	0
WTP	5009	Then a historian who wondered how these Spanish torture devices had reached Sussex discovered not only that the Spanish Inquisition never used these type of devices , but that they were all local and British-made . 	0
WTP	5010	The point is that a balance has to be achieved between positive and negative . 	0
WTP	5011	These were immediately labelled and put into the local museum as " Torture devices of the Spanish Inquisition . " 	0
WTP	5012	For decades people looked at them and tutted in horror at the evils of the Catholic Church . 	0
WTP	5013	Many people ' s views of the Catholic Church have been formed by the " cold-war " propaganda of past eras , which sought to demonize Catholicism through spin and exaggeration . 	1
WTP	5014	A typical example of how this leads people to assume the worst was when some instruments of torture were found in a castle in Sussex 100 years ago . 	0
WTP	5015	Further to Karanacs objections : The article is necessarily broad-brush . 	1

WTP	5028	Not exactly what sure what you mean by some of this without a dif to point at or something . 	0
WTP	5029	However , terms like denialism , misrepresentation and distortion are how main view scientists have received theories differing from HIV causing AIDS . 	0
WTP	5030	The issue at hand , if one is going to give any lip service to dissent , is the fact that some * scientists * dissent . 	0
WTP	5031	Anything that is relevant can be added to the appropriate sections in chronological order of which they occur . 	0
WTP	5032	So , when describing a controversy that has been given the label " denialism " ( a contortion of the English language ) , why is it a " misrepresentation " or " distortion " of a * scientific * WP article to focus on * scientists * in that section ? 	0

WTP	5044	Certainly much better than before . 	0
WTP	5045	A brief scan through parts of the article reveals some dubious points : In 1521 , the first Catholics were baptized in what would become the first Christian nation in Southeast Asia , the Philippines . [ 171 ] The following year , Franciscan missionaries arrived in what is now Mexico , although they did not begin large-scale baptisms until 1537 , when Pope Paul III determined that the indigenous peoples did have souls . [ 174 ] Over the next 150 years , the missions expanded into southwestern North America . [ 175 ] The native people were legally defined as children , and the priests took on a paternalistic role , often enforced with corporal punishment . [ 176 ] In India , Portuguese missionaries and the Spanish Jesuit Francis Xavier evangelized among a Christian community which had been established by Thomas the Apostle . [ 177 ] I find a lot of this information very dubious . 	1
WTP	5046	Huge numbers were converted in Mexico before 1537 , and I don ' t think there was much serious debate over whether Indians had souls . 	0
WTP	5047	WHO legally defined native people as children , Church , Governments ? 	0
WTP	5048	Where and when ? 	0
WTP	5049	" Corporal punishment " applied to everyone who wasn ' t a noble up until fairly recent times . 	0
WTP	5050	Francis Xavier didn ' t only " evangelise " Thomas christians , but non-christians as well . 	0

WTP	5176	Remember , this is not a list of definitive pseudosciences , but rather a list of characterizations . 	0
WTP	5177	This perpetrates the inherent bias of this article ' s inclusion criteria which allows for characterizations made by certain notable organizations and people , but disallows characterizations made by other organizations and people just as notable . 	0
WTP	5178	Because some editors feel that these organizations and researchers are in themselves pseuodskeptical and / or pseudoscientific , thus they are ill-equipped to label something a pseudoscience and therefore their views on what they characterize to be a pseudoscience should not be included in this list . 	0
WTP	5179	Why ? 	0
WTP	5180	Recent attempts to include significant views of certain notable organizations , notable academics and notable researchers have been summarily eliminated and denied from this article . 	0
WTP	5181	So , why are we including the characterizations made by these researchers and organizations , but excluding - and moreover disallowing - the characterizations made by other researchers and organizations . 	0
WTP	5182	While per WP : PSCI only a general consensus in the scientific community can truly label a topic as pseudoscience , this article includes entries of topics which have only been characterized as a pseudoscience by one researcher or by one skeptical organization and not the general scientific community . 	0

WTP	5338	Without making any inapprpriate comparisons the Dede Maroz page does not say that Dede Maroz is mythical . 	0

WTP	5352	Popper also stated " When speaking here of Darwinism , I shall speak always of today ' s theory - that is Darwin ' s own theory of natural selection supported by the Mendelian theory of heredity . . " so the statement about Darwin ' s original theory is nonsense . 	0

WTP	5435	The fact is that plenty of distasteful picketing occurs on both sides ( see http://img.timeinc.net/time/daily/2003/0301/protest0121.jpg ) and that silent and subdued protests are far and few between when it comes to topics this fervently debated . 	1
WTP	5436	Specifically , the fact that the pro-life protest is shown as modest and subdued whereas the pro-choice protest is depicted as obnoxious and fervent . 	0
WTP	5437	While the details are not really that relevant ( the fact that one picture contains attractive people in their mid-20 ' s and the other is a badly compressed image of 30-40 year-olds ) the subjects ' activities are . 	0
WTP	5438	Its also worth pointing out that the rally picture is of a much lower quality . 	1
WTP	5439	The one displaying pro-life supporters shows young men and women holding a silent vigil , whereas the pro-choice representation shows older people rallying and picketing obnoxiously . 	0
WTP	5440	I think the two pictures displayed alongside the " Abortion Debate " headline within the article are a bit ridiculous . 	1

WTP	5509	However , when a reference is included , is isn ' t a copyright violation , it called a REFERENCE . 	0

WTP	5520	They are criticism , not research . 	0
WTP	5521	Reviews aren ' t the same as histories or biographies ; they are critical commentary / opinion , and do not have authoritative weight on the histories and biogrpahies cover , because that ' s not what they are intended to cover . 	1
WTP	5522	So far I only see one source that would classify as such , that being this . 	0
WTP	5523	What Ibaranoff needs to provide is a reliable source ( or several ) that explain why System of a Down shouldn ' t be classified as nu metal ; providing sources that simply don ' t say the words " nu metal " isn ' t the same thing . 	1
WTP	5524	The MTV article cited describes SOAD as a nu metal band and provides a context for them within the genre . 	0
WTP	5525	Now , as for sources . 	0
WTP	5526	Aside from that , many of the sources Ibaranoff points to at Talk : System of a Down are album / live reviews . 	0
WTP	5527	Furthermore , one of the primary metal histories used a source for the article , Ian Christe ' s Sound of the Beast , describes them as nu metal as well , in a chapter largely devoted to nu metal ( I just double checked the book this instant ) . 	0

WTP	5540	In fact it reduces it , because the reader can only be left in confusion wondering what the vulgar word might have been . 	1
WTP	5541	So clearly you believe we need information on the origin of the word here . 	0
WTP	5542	If so , we have to look at how we can make this section as clear and informative as possible . 	0
WTP	5543	Avoid words such as slander , traditional , liberal orthodox conservative . 	0
WTP	5544	I support the more correct wording even if it appears to others to be pro-Catholic ( which I dont think it does - facts are facts and we just want to tell the truth ) If we eliminate current wording in favor of Karanacs proposal , we lose several important wikilinks too . 	0
WTP	5545	We can ' t just eliminate important facts just to appear to be not - pro Catholic . 	0

WTP	5553	( ec ) First of all , if Wikipedia could actually ruin Christmas , a lot of ass-clowns would have hijacked the Project for other purposes ; its an argument without merit . 	0
WTP	5554	Secondly , you will note that the Dede Maroz , Christkind or other names for Santa / Father Christmas aren ' t as widely read as this , one of the three main articles on the subject ( the other two being Father Christmas and Saint Nicholas ) , and certainly they aren ' t anywhere near the quality of this one ; they aren ' t a valid comparison . 	1

WTP	5571	I remember reading in history books that Warren G . Harding was our first black President . 	0

WTP	5602	My position is that you started the edit war by removing a very central piece of information that had been in the article since 2006 as " utter irrelevance " , and persisting in reverting attempts to put it back by me and another person that just saw your removal as absurd ( I think claiming it ' s irrelevant is revisionism if anything ) . 	0

WTP	5605	I think that the page should have been renamed Catholic Church and the first sentence gone the other way around saying " The Catholic Church , also known as the Roman Catholic Church … " . 	1
WTP	5606	I think this is evident from the title of the book " The Catechism of the Catholic Church " which is conspicuously not entitled " The Catechism of the Roman Catholic Church " . 	0
WTP	5607	The Roman Catholic Church is the only one that officially calls itself the Catholic Church . 	0

WTP	5611	A peer reviewer has made two suggestions for improvement to the article that would be significant changes . 	0
WTP	5612	Roman Catholic Church is part of Christianity and it would be inconsistent to make the comparison here , it would also be off topic for the subject matter of the page . 	0
WTP	5613	What you should do is make that kind of comparison on the Christianity article since you are comparing a whole faith to a whole faith - the number of Christians to the number of Muslims . 	1
WTP	5614	It seems like comparing apples to oranges to put any comment about Muslims outnumbering Roman Catholics . 	0
WTP	5615	This is more than mere History , it has to do with the present day and the two issues of Origin and Mission go together , they are entertwined with each other and extend beyond the concept of History with regards to the church ' s activities in the world today . 	0
WTP	5616	Also , eliminating the Nicene Creed will not help the reader who wants to know what the Catholic Church believes . 	1
WTP	5617	It would relegate the most important part of Roman Catholic Belief to a mere wikilink which I think makes an improper statement and moves the wikilinked page of Nicene Creed out of control of the Roman Catholic page . 	0
WTP	5618	Currently , I dont think the Nicene Creed page is a very good page and if our page eventually becomes FA , that would help the reader have confidence in what he or she is reading on the RCC page which should include the short Nicene Creed quote . 	0

WTP	5642	I think the " obnoxious and fervent " complaint has more to do with scale : the pro-choice photograph was taken at the March for Women ' s Lives while the pro-life one appears to be a smaller scale demonstration staged solely by Bound for Life . 	1
WTP	5643	I myself am against the addition of hip hop . 	1
WTP	5644	The genre is not prevalent enough in Rihanna ' s music I would say , and the influences of it that are present in her music are covered by contemporary R&B which is already listed . 	0

WTP	5700	The titles mentioned of " First Master " and " First Lord " are in fact technically more accurate terms than " First Gentleman " , it ' s just that journalist and commentators seem to think that Gentleman is the equivalent of Lady in this context which , if you are pedantic , it isn ' t . 	0
WTP	5701	Yet present wording does mention the major events and provides wikilinks that Karanacs version would eliminate . 	0
WTP	5702	Responding to Karanacs : The present article wording does not mention justification of either Mary or Elizabeth ' s actions - it treats them equally - NPOV . 	0
WTP	5703	No offense , it is just my honest opinion . 	0

WTP	5728	The Grand Loge de France violates Anderson ' s Constitutions by not requiring a belief in a Supreme Being ; as such , its regularity is not in question at all , but nonexistent . 	0

WTP	5878	If I were to move the " . . . considered in part , or wholly . . . . . . . a terrorist organisation . . . . " statement to a more appropriate section in the article and don ' t get any opposition from you , then it would be more in line with the method used on the " israel " wiki page . 	0

WTP	6001	What you initially proposed is that we include negative facts about Obama for the sake of including negative facts , which is not criticism at all . 	0
WTP	6002	And yes , I am disqualifying many of the accounts from which this was brought this up in the past - they are now banned as fake accounts , and the long-term editors here have been very wary of new accounts making similar proposals . 	0

WTP	6010	The new page could also address social ( young adults , thus orphans ) and political ( locations other than South Africa ) issues in more detail . 	0
WTP	6011	In such case , my opinion is that the Denialism section could be excised entirely and moved to the new page instead of being an awkward part of the HIV page . 	0
WTP	6012	Finally , if the issue really boils down to focusing more on the science ( which I generally support ) , perhaps yet another page could be created specifically about " HIV and AIDS Linkage " or some similar title . 	0

WTP	6077	Although the Washington Times is sometimes a reliable source for some content , it is problematic when it comes to politics due to the paper ' s strong conservative bent , lackluster respect for factual accuracy ( often mischaracterizing or printing unsubstantiated facts to support its position ) , and being very sloppy about distinguishing opinion and propaganda from factual reportage . 	1
WTP	6078	This article is a case in point . 	0

WTP	6120	My main objection to change would be the amount of work necessary to re-order the article and re-write . 	0
WTP	6121	The section is probably too long , as I have already said . 	0
WTP	6122	One way of changing it would be to have a sentence ot two on origin and basic mission at the start of the article , with more detailed material placed under " History " and " beliefs " . 	0

WTP	6124	Again , that is just a possible option for discussion . 	0

WTP	6149	Also , you state that Smith ' s account is in the Pearl of Great Price and is considered scripture by adherents , but only the LDS Church has canonized the 1838 account — other Mormon fundamentalists don ' t necessarily view the account as scripture . 	0

WTP	6267	The newly rewritten intro - This is a list of topics characterized as pseudoscience by organizations within the international scientific community , by notable skepticalorganizations , or by notable academics or researchers . . . - makes no mention of the organizations or people being only those with " mainstream " points of view . 	0
WTP	6268	I don ' t think that CCHR fails as an RS for this particular article . 	1
WTP	6269	Sure it is a front for Scientology , but this list doesn ' t proclude such sources from being used . 	0
WTP	6270	The bottomline is that CCHR is a notable psychiatry skeptic organization . 	0
WTP	6271	And beyond that , those who are calling psychiatry a pseudoscience per the CCHR sources are each unto themselves notable academics and researchers ( Thomas Szasz for instance certainly passes the WP : N threshhold , as does Fred Baughman , Julian Whitaker , and Mary Ann Block , to cite a few ) . 	0
WTP	6272	That CCHR is a " pseudoskeptical organization " is just a judgment of a Fyslee ( I tend to agree FWIW ) , but even if it was a judgment of another reliable source , that still doesn ' t disqualify the CCHR as a notable skeptical organization which has characterized something as pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	6273	However , if this list article also recognizes significant points of view from notable organizations , researchers , and academic outside of the mainstream , then the list becomes compliant with NPOV . 	0
WTP	6274	If we are going to limit the inclusionary criteria of this list article to just mainstream sources , then the entire list article will stand as a WP : NPOV violation and probably should be nominated for deletion as such . 	0

WTP	6344	Traditional heavy metal primarily draws from two sources ( one a foreign language source ) , so it ' s in no way indicative of all research available on metal . 	0

WTP	6346	Of course , some UN or other civilian installations were hit , some with good reason ( any military use cancels the place ' s protection according to the Geneva Conventions ) ; some were hit by error - nothing and no-one is 100% accurate , and when people send rockets from the middle of the city , innocents are bound to get hurt . 	0

WTP	6361	CCHR is clearly not a reliable source for declaring what is and what isn ' t a pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	6362	Does this make sense ? 	0
WTP	6363	Characterized = point of view and hence this article should adhere to NPOV by presenting all significant POVs . 	0

WTP	6373	The position Ling . 	0
WTP	6374	Nut advocates distorts historical perspective ; compared with other controversies , the sex abuse scandals are barely notable , and including it in the lead gives them far more than their due weight . 	0

WTP	6415	There I found the allegations of phosphorus weapon use , so I proceeded to add a few tightly written sentences including citations plus internal and external links . 	0
WTP	6416	So is the " undue weight " argument that that these allegations and countercharges among young Israeli soldiers , with serious repercussions throughout Israeli society , isn ' t as " heavy " as charges of phosphorus weapons use and can ' t appear beside it ? 	0
WTP	6417	I felt the content is relevant in light of interest among the English-language readership ( some of whom are likely to view it as fuel for criticism of the IDF and Israel ; hence my unfortunate use here of the terms " atrocities and war crimes " that I trusted was certainly not to be read as any agenda of my own ! ) . 	0

WTP	6478	My understanding of that statement is that it means , if it is possible to avoid linking from within quotes , avoid linking from within quotes . 	0
WTP	6479	Also Ibranoff , if you are going to keeping insisting " The sources clearly state that they are not nu metal " , you need to provide those sources so they can be evaluated . 	0

WTP	6491	OK , but as it is repeated , should the copy in the lede stay ? 	1
WTP	6492	I would suggest no , and to keep the copy in the Beliefs section . 	1
WTP	6493	In the lede it sounds quite a bit more specific and indeed almost narrow in context , whereas the rest of the lede is very general , broad , and top-down sounding . 	0
WTP	6494	However , given that I am hearing one " doesn ' t matter " and one ( apparently ) " no keep as is " , I am glad I brought it up first , and any further input welcome and indeed desired . 	0
WTP	6495	Further , I find it curious that I am being urged by several people ( unquestionably dedicated , but perhaps a bit narrow-minded ) to " use the Talk page " when those same people have repeatedly avoided addressing some of the issues I have raised here on Talk about the usability of this article . 	1

WTP	6499	As for the ' I don ' t like it ' comment , I don ' t mind these images at all , I ' m just looking for the most suitable one , and preferably not one that ' s going to be removed every few days by someone who objects to it . 	0
WTP	6500	Now to address your point Bleh - your argument regarding sexual images is moot ; there are of course such images at commons if people want to see them , just as there are plenty of gory images of dead people and such , but there is no photograph on sexual intercourse of two individuals at the height of copulation . 	0
WTP	6501	Regarding pictures from long past wars , there obviously won ' t be anything in the form of a photograph , but there plenty of paintings etc . I had a very brief look for something suitable but there was nothing that especially caught my eye . 	0
WTP	6502	There is already a picture from a 20th century war just below in the suicide attack section , as well as the image of American graves in the lead , so I believe it would be more balanced to include something from times long past , like artwork from a chariot battle for example . 	0
WTP	6503	There is no need to show the most graphic or pornographic image just because one is available , and if an image is controversial for whatever reason there should be at least some rationale for keeping it . 	0
WTP	6504	It probably doesn ' t deserve any more than a sentence but not mentioning it could be seen as inconsistent with NPOV requirements . 	0

WTP	6508	It would not preclude attributing the material to the author of the work , but as such that should probably be made explicit for clarity . 	0
WTP	6509	What it does preclude is simply attribution of its material to the institutional church itself , as that would be the posterchild of original research . 	0
WTP	6510	Just two cents : the lack of either decree does not in and of itself preclude the use of a source here . 	1

WTP	6575	Even though I fail to see the meaning of that article , and how it contradicts this one , it is more accurate in its depict of the musical interrelations of the early bands , with emphasis on Black Sabbath . . 	0
WTP	6576	but hey , that ' s the case with a few 100 , 000 articles here on this second hand source page . 	0
WTP	6577	How do you know Black Sabbath ' s importance is false , a myth ? 	0
WTP	6578	The comment about " over-reliance on confirmation rather than refutation " strikes me as odd : not only unsupported by WP , but contradicting the scientific nature of this topic which has inspired very careful research for over two decades . 	1
WTP	6579	The paragraph where Black Sabbath , Deep Purple , and Led Zeppelin are mentioned as pioneers of the genre is invalid ; it states that all three bands were reviled by critics . 	1
WTP	6580	First off , Deep Purple met indifference in their start , which is not the same as being reviled , which their albums never were . 	0
WTP	6581	With their success that followed in the U . S . , they were , however , acclaimed . 	0
WTP	6582	Secondly , Led Zeppelin never met criticism like that of Black Sabbath ; Zeppelin were , instead , criticized for not being as good as , according to Rolling Stone in the review of their first album , like The Jeff Beck Group , and Robert Plant was compared condescendingly to Rod Stewart . 	0
WTP	6583	Basically , not the same kind of criticism Black Sabbath got . 	0
WTP	6584	Sabbath were persistently rejected until their fifth album ( I dislike referring to wikipedia articles , but this is backed by the articles for all their first five albums ) Sabbath Bloody Sabbath . 	0
WTP	6585	The criticism was a direct result of their alien-sounding music , which clashed with the current , which was blues-inspired Hard rock , like Zeppelin , Purple , Iron Butterfly etc . To conclude , the introduction falters and misleads , and should be rewritten more accurately . 	0

WTP	6622	You have pointed to at most seven sources on the band ' s talk page ( out of , what , hundreds of sources available ? ) , all of which are only web sources ( no print has been considered ) , and most of which are useless because they are album reviews , or they are simply unreliable . 	0
WTP	6623	There is no sound argument to back the assertion that " progressive rock , art rock , experimental rock and alternative metal are used more often in relation to the band ' s music " . 	0

WTP	6629	The Iranian state-controlled website ( PRESIDENT . IR ) is a primary source of questionable nature . 	0
WTP	6630	What it does tell us , in conjunction with the other article from prominent pre-1900 members of the church is that there was a discussion about Smith ' s claims to have seen a Vision and that vision involved God . 	0
WTP	6631	Further I do not accept that there is a complete consensus in the non-Mormon academic community concerning this matter . 	0
WTP	6632	All Gore tried that one , and well maybe we should believe him , after all he did invent the internet and has does have a Bachelor ' s degree in Government . 	0

WTP	6634	If it did happen , how would including it detract from its relevance ? 	0
WTP	6635	Smith did not claim to " frequently seeing God " just as you say , however what is interesting about this article is when it is taken in context with Smith ' s own writings of how the community received his ideas does support his claims , if somewhat indirectly . 	0

WTP	6810	I disagree with this , and feel that use of the term ( heavy metal ) throughout the ' 70s was largely consistent with modern standards , and much of the crossing of " hard rock " and " heavy metal " very probably arose from the fact that many hard rock bands of the time did a few metal songs . 	0

WTP	7450	I ' m starting a new thread to break away from the above discussion , which , for the most part , has turned from the subject . 	0
WTP	7451	The controversy section should outline for what practices the IDF has been criticized and why ( with sources ) , not for what specific events , because it is possible to find multiple sources criticizing the IDF for its every single publicized operation at least starting with the First Lebanon War and onwards . 	0
WTP	7452	Feel free to rewrite the section , but please try not to place undue weight on recent events ( Cast Lead , and even the 2006 Lebanon War attracted undue attention on Wikipedia in general , unlike for example the much bigger 1956 Sinai War ) . 	0
WTP	7453	Now , I agree that the controversy section is severely lacking ( in quality , not length ) , and IMO one of the reasons is that this article does not have many dedicated editors . 	0
WTP	7454	There is no reason to detail each incident , and certainly not in the context of soldiers ' coming out ' to ' reveal ' something about the IDF , as indeed there is an entire organization in Israel devoted to this very purpose , which is not mentioned even once in the article . 	0
WTP	7455	Even if many notable organizations accuse the IDF of war crimes here , the article should take a more general approach , such as " The IDF was accused of war crimes for its actions in several operations , including Sabra and Shatila and Operation Cast Lead . [ ref ] " . 	0
WTP	7456	Therefore , I fail to see how something like this would not be undue weight for the article . 	1
WTP	7457	Firstly , I don ' t think it ' s our place to judge whether these actions amounted to war crimes , assuming the testaments are true and were reported correctly . 	0

WTP	7658	- Well , I can ' t speak for Wikiscient , but I assume it ' s for the same reasons I stated here repeatedly : The dead Gettysburg soldier is too specific for a lead image : this is not death in general , it ' s the death of a soldier in war - this also applies to the Pope image , another very specific case of death . 	0
WTP	7659	Let ' s toss those non-biologists then ! 	0
WTP	7660	We need a new section soon , this is getting lengthy . 	1
WTP	7661	Whether an oil-painting or the photograph of a real human skull , as suggested by Nk . sheridan above ( at the bottom of the paragraph " Lead image question again " ) , I don ' t really care . 	0

WTP	7665	The same applies to the Inquisition figure . 	0
WTP	7666	If you say 3-4 , 000 were probaby executed - when ? 	0
WTP	7667	The problem with setting down a figure like 3-4000 in isolation is that it has no context . 	1
WTP	7668	Just like the headline figure of 4 , 00o clerics accused of sex abuse in the US , it has no context unless you add that in the 40 year period covered there were hundreds of thousands of priests and religious serving in the US . 	0
WTP	7669	The original sources , one of which was Kamen , actually said that the Spanish Inquisition sentenced 3-4% of convicted people to death over its existence , ( technically , released to the civil authority , ) but that only half of these executions were actually carried out . 	0
WTP	7670	I didn ' t quibble about the original quotation , since more qualification would only have made the article longer . 	1
WTP	7671	If you look at the image in full resolution , the death of the soldier depicted is rather obvious - but the lead image should obviously and broadly stand for death at first glance . 	0

WTP	7673	If you believe that any restriction on land ownership is communist , then I ' m afraid you have a definition of " communist " that varies wildly from the commonly accepted definition . 	0
WTP	7674	In any case , this argument is entirely pointless : it ' s quite clear that the generally accepted view is that South Africa is a liberal democracy . 	1
WTP	7675	Nope , I believe the Soviet Union was really communist . 	0
WTP	7676	And , based on living here , I can quite confidently say that South Africa is really not . 	0
WTP	7677	Also , is " death " the first thing the soldier picture evokes ? 	0
WTP	7678	Without the caption , especially at the low image size in the article , it ' s just a person lying on the ground , apparently badly wounded , but not necessarily dead at first glance . 	0

WTP	7700	All of this is super easy to reference ; and yet , some editors refuse to allow any mention of it in the article . 	0
WTP	7701	How about an actual number of the victims of the abusers ? 	0
WTP	7702	This means including the strange yet notable viewpoints of organizations such as CoS . 	0
WTP	7703	If we are going to base our inclusion criteria on characterizations ( viewpoints ) then the article must adhere to the rigors of what NPOV says about viewpoints - in essence , this article must represent all significant viewpoints fairly . 	0
WTP	7704	As it stands now though , the article allows for the inclusion of items which are not pseudosciences - yet they are included in the list because some notable source has characterized it as such . 	0
WTP	7705	Again , if this article was simply " List of Pseudosciences " where we could only include entries that are either obvious pseudosciences or generally considered pseudoscience by the scientific community , then we would not be dealing with this NPOV issue . 	0
WTP	7706	" Pseudoscience " is the characterization du jour and Scientology is a notable source ( not a reliable source of labelling something " pseudoscience " , but a notable source nonetheless which has made such a characterization ) . 	0
WTP	7707	But this article is not simply a list of pseudosciences ; it is rather a list of characterizations made by notable sources . 	0
WTP	7708	If this article were just a list of pseudosciences , then I would agree entirely with you - that Scientology ' s distorted view of science precludes it from representing the scientific community as a whole . 	0

WTP	7729	Some of the entries have only been characterized as such by a small fraction of notable sources while the majority of the scientific community wouldn ' t necessarily apply the same characterization . 	0
WTP	7730	Remember , this article includes entries which are NOT definitively pseudoscience - entries which per PSCI we cannot label as such even in their own articles . 	0
WTP	7731	Since we are dealing with notable characterizations , there is no excuse for dismissing Scientology ' s characterizations . 	0
WTP	7732	This is not a " list of pseudosciences " but rather a " list of topics characterized as pseudoscience " . 	0
WTP	7733	However , this article is not about definitively labelling any topic as pseudoscience , but rather just including topics which have been characterized as pseudoscience by some notable source . 	0
WTP	7734	Enric , I personally agree with you re : Scientology ' s not being reliable at labelling something definitively as pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	7735	As such , we should not exclude their views from this article - as per NPOV . 	0

WTP	7740	But at least as a " List of pseudosciences " using WP : PSCI , it will be the exact same grey which we deal with at Category : Pseudoscience and on the individual article level - articles for those topics which reside in the grey amongst pseudo - , proto - , and fringe science . 	0
WTP	7741	This means that if there is a consensus to categorize a topic in Category : Pseudoscience , then that same consensus could be applied to include the topic in " List of pseudosciences " . 	0

WTP	7774	It could be argued that Catholics suffered more from this , since in most cases their historic faith was suddenly banned and a new one imposed . 	1

WTP	7810	Books like the Voices of Morebath show that popular involvement with the Church often decreased with the onset of the Reformation . 	0

WTP	7898	This was coupled with accusation of describing the Holocaust as a myth [ 25 ] [ 26 ] and of making statements influenced by classic anti-Semitic ideas , [ 27 ] which has led some to accuse him of anti-Semitism .

WTP	7900	In the West this was coupled with accusation of describing the Holocaust as a myth [ 25 ] [ 26 ] and of making statements influenced by classic anti-Semitic ideas , [ 27 ] which has led to accusations of anti-Semitism , [ 28 ] though he has denied these accusations , saying that he " respects Jews very much " and that he was not " passing judgment " on the Holocaust . [ 21 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] this phrasing and the use of the word " falsely " give rise to the idea that the other allegations of holocaust denial and anti-semitism are false . 	0
WTP	7901	also , false is a needless judgement when the facts of the matter are a click away . 	1
WTP	7902	also the words " much " are ommitable i suggest that this sentence will be true to the facts of the matter and invite people to continue and read the appropriate section . 	0

WTP	7917	When it does detract ( from the article ) , then that is due to what is in the Personal life section obviously mattering to people and having something significant in it ; it does not solely have trivial matters . 	0

WTP	8079	This is not vandalism , it is a content . 	0
WTP	8080	I can see two solutions : Personally , I prefer my suggested " technically left and rejoined " wording , because with the addition of only 3 extra words it conveys a much richer picture of what happened than either of two disputed versions . 	1
WTP	8081	The full situation is explained rather well in a succinct paragraph in the history section , but the " rejoined " summary in the intro could mislead the reader into believing that Northern Ireland tried out life in the Free State for a while before packing its bags and going back to London . 	0
WTP	8082	This sort of technical hiatus applies in all sorts of situations , and should of course be described where the issue is considered in detail … but in a one-sentence summary to describe the situation solely as a " rejoining " is misleading . 	1

WTP	8114	The situation was straightforward and very simple : Therefore , north stays and south leaves . 	0
WTP	8115	Who cares about the meaningless details in a transitional process when all that ' s important is the end result . 	0
WTP	8116	For a summary , keep the key facts that allow a new reader to understand what happened . 	0
WTP	8117	Adding the word ' technically ' may be correct to an extent , but is still misleading in a summary for someone who knows nothing about Ireland . 	0
WTP	8118	BrownHairedGirl - I am against your ' compromise ' proposal , because they are essentially no different than what " O ' Fenian " initially has said , and still implies the same PoV that he wants . 	1

WTP	8131	The quasi-religious defense of a monolithic consensus is the main problem that is undermining the value of this page . 	1
WTP	8132	As I said recently , the lead should focus on scientific facts , with minimal mention of social consequences . 	1
WTP	8133	Highlighting orphans in the lead here ( rather than only in the main body of text on HIV ) is itself an example of undue weight , because it over-dramatizes the social aspect of an article about a virus . 	1
WTP	8134	The social , economic , etc . consequences are covered on the AIDS page . 	0
WTP	8135	Undue weight on AIDS consequences in the HIV article leads to an undercurrent of HIV = AIDS , conflating the virus with the syndrome . 	0

WTP	8138	So as to avoid making the perfect the enemy of the good , I would strongly suggest drafting a way to mention it in the lede , even if only a very minimal mention , so as to discourage such understandable but in the end not helpful edits . 	1
WTP	8139	While I fully agree with the concerns of recentism and historical balance ( consider in 1000 years what this article would look like : this flap would barely get a footnote if that ! ) , I also recognize the empirical reality Karanacs and others have mentioned , that if no mention is made in the lede , editors less informed about the editorial issues here will even in good faith bombard it with edits to mention it . 	0

WTP	8187	The current trees produced go back to approx 550 million years back ( based on Cambrian explosion ) , that is our tree of biodiversity based on fossils , molecular similarity , etc etc . The fact that the tree converges to a common ancestor is based on evidence quite different from the evidence used to justify our current tree for biodiversity . 	1
WTP	8188	That ' s why biodiversity and common ancestor are two different theories that complement each other . 	0
WTP	8189	Saying that drift and selection do not produce diversity is therefore a very wrong statement . 	1
WTP	8190	You have to differentiate biodiversity from common ancestor . 	0
WTP	8191	Mutations , by themselves , will never produce diversity without a mechanism to retain the beneficial ones . 	0
WTP	8192	So mutation is the raw material for these two mechanisms to produce diversity . 	0

WTP	8240	I have already remarked on your less knowledgeable status as a musician which is clearly visible ; the final verses of " Black Sabbath " are in a minor scale and not bluesy in any way , but since you see them as blues , I kind of get where you ' re coming from . 	0

WTP	8315	The term apparently did exist by that point ( the first use by a critic according to this article was in 1968 ) , though it seemingly ( again , according to this article and its sources ) wasn ' t used by a writer in a context ( relatively ) in line with its current until 1971 on Sir Lord Baltimore . 	0

WTP	8320	" Highway Star " is sort of the prototype for a lot of speed metal and flashy ' 80s stuff , while " War Pigs " was obviously very influential to a lot of the doom metal and ' stoner metal ' material from the ' 70s ( Pentagram , Bedemon ) on . 	0

WTP	8341	" This finding is very surprising . " 	0
WTP	8342	As such the use of the term " Resistance to CCR5 inhibition is also less important if CXCR4 strains of HIV emerge ( these use CXCR4 rather than CCR5 as a coreceptor , from which they become independent ) , and the patient carried this virus at low levels " is fairly deceptive since it implies that this treatment does nothing for the CXCR4 virus . 	1

WTP	8350	I also want to add that the Siena College Poll is a well respected poll for Presidential rankings , and has been one of the main contributors to those rankings for almost 30 years . 	0

WTP	8354	Looks good to me . 	0
WTP	8355	But anyway , even if it were a criticism we don ' t divide the article into criticism and praise sections , but rather work things into the right article ( s ) in due proportion to their biographical importance and relevance . 	0

WTP	8363	Im sorry but the wording is currently VERY misleading and such inaccurate statements should not be allowed to remain for too long . 	0

WTP	8391	What would also be useful would be an indication of how specific this aid is . 	1

WTP	8393	An up-to-date figure could appropriately be included there but I didn ' t think it was worth using one that was too old . 	0

WTP	8412	Thank you for self-reverting . 	0
WTP	8413	You need a reliable source which refutes the claim . 	0
WTP	8414	On the other hand , the current source does not make the claim ; it merely reports that his weblog makes the claim . 	1

WTP	8452	3 : Regarding your third point , I must not be grasping the distinction of the point you are trying to make . 	0
WTP	8453	The title has the dual meaning of " hostess " and " wife " , and the two do not need to be the same . 	0
WTP	8454	I did attempted an online search to cite Burke ' s Peerage for reference to British usage of the title , but found nothing . 	0

WTP	8529	I ' ve already addressed that argument , several times : Putting aside the veracity of the claim that the charge was " rejected " in the Hezbollah case ( it was not ) , it is irrelevant editorializing to imply that what was claimed in one different instance ( different time , different place , different organization ) is also the case in this instance . 	1
WTP	8530	In the discussion above under the heading Misleading Description of Partition , editors are unable to agree on a form of summary wording to use in the lead section of this article to describe the fate of Northern Ireland under the Anglo-Irish Treaty . 	1
WTP	8531	One side insists that it is right to say that Northern Ireland " remained in the United Kingdom " ; the other prefers to say that it " rejoined the United Kingdom " . 	0
WTP	8532	From what I can see , neither side is wrong , but it appears that the reality is more complex than is implied by either of those short phrases . 	0
WTP	8533	The underlying facts do not seem to be in dispute , and are set out in detail both later this article at Ireland # History and also in Northern Ireland # History . 	0
WTP	8534	The treaty provided that Northern Ireland would become part of the Irish Free State , but would have the right to opt out and become part of the United Kingdom . 	1
WTP	8535	There appears to be agreement that there was clear expectation on all sides that it would do so , and this was done immediately after the treaty came into effect . 	1
WTP	8536	The whole process , which involved the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland travelling overland to London to personally present the documents , took 48 hours . 	1
WTP	8537	I have seen no suggestion either in this discussion or in related articles that at any point in those 48 hours the Irish Free State had any practical control of affairs within Northern Ireland . 	0
WTP	8538	So I suggested a compromise wording : " technically left and rejoined the United Kingdom " . 	0

WTP	8545	As well as the sentence been recentist , it paints a bias athiest / protestant centric picture that in the modern day , the Catholic Church has no worth and its only standing is for the sensationalistic American media to whine about its followers and highlight some of the negatives ( sex abuse scandal ) , while giving attention to none of the positives . 	0

WTP	8574	Comment Well , it would be strange to " support " myself , but to repeat it : I think that the article needs a lead image that stands for " death " as broadly as possible , at least broadly for human death , which is what the article does focus on . 	0
WTP	8575	Instead of the painting ( which I inserted after suggesting it here and receiving no response for several days ) I would also agree with any other image of a human skull , although I think that the painting is very fitting . 	0

WTP	8587	Using the word sects , but quoting it , clues in the reader that Smith ' s 1830s use of the term may not necessarily mean what the modern reader might think . 	0
WTP	8588	It also lets us side-step the question of Smith ' s precise meaning . 	0
WTP	8589	I doubt the term sect had the same pejorative connotation in the 1830s as it does today , though certainly Smith was antisectarian , and like any Christian primitivist in the 1820s thought that sects and denominations were a corruption of the Christian church . 	1
WTP	8590	But rather than trying to parse the primary sources ourselves ( which could be [ [ WP : OR | original research ) , I think we ought to let the secondary sources guide us . 	0
WTP	8591	When Jan Shipps describes the vision story in her Mormonism ( 1985 ) book , page 9 , she uses the word sects in quotes : " this theophany answered the lad ' s question about which of the ' sects ' were right and which were wrong . " 	0
WTP	8592	Maybe that ' s the proper approach . 	1
WTP	8593	I don ' t think it ' s wrong , or necessarily non-neutral , to use a word like church or denomination in this context , but using Smith ' s own language--like Shipps does--has the added advantage of reflecting the flavor of Smith ' s early anti-sectarian views which he shared with other Christian primitivists . 	0
WTP	8594	I know some of the existing secondary sources , like Bushman ' s Smith biography , don ' t really make a distinction between church , denomination , and sect , but that ' s probably just because the authors haven ' t specifically thought of it as an issue . 	0

WTP	8612	This would be a completely useful list , rather than the mess we are working on now ! 	0
WTP	8613	My guess as to why we haven ' t adopted this obvious and logical solution is that some editors want so badly to associate certain non-pseudoscientific topics with pseudoscience , that they are willing to throw NPOV and logic out the window just for the satisfaction of including such topics in this muddled and unencyclopaedic list . 	0

WTP	8620	But where and how do we draw the line ? 	0

WTP	8640	Frankly , the " but other articles do it " defense doesn ' t hold water . 	1
WTP	8641	Other than being uninformative , it is my opinion that such images would detract from the quality of this article , by lessening its stringent adherance to NPOV . 	0

WTP	8761	When do the sources actually say that ? 	0
WTP	8762	If " hard rock " is vague in any sense other than its direct relation to metal , it ' s because of its use as an umbrella term , which I suspect is only partially connected to hard rock as a genre in-and-of itself . 	1

WTP	8824	Burying Mission in Church will really make that important paragraph obscure and placing origins in hisory will make that paragraph disconnect with Beliefs for which it is a logical precursor based on Jesus promise to St Peter " What you bind on Earth will be bound in Heaven " . 	0
WTP	8825	These two items : Origins and Mission relate to the current activity of the church in the world today - not just history and thus they cant be considered history alone . 	1
WTP	8826	Also , I want to add that I thought all of Karanacs comments on Peer Review were fine with a couple small exceptions and I plan to address all of them eventually . 	0
WTP	8827	The logic flows well since you have the church being founded and its mission defined which directly affects the formation of its Beliefs . 	1

WTP	8830	Answering the question of Where did it come from is one of the first questions readers will have about the church - see the FA on Islam which actually puts the answers to this question in the lead and expands on it there as well . 	0
WTP	8831	Origins tells the reader Where did it come from which I think is an important question to answer up front since the Gospel passage in the origins section is the basis for the church existence . 	0

WTP	8835	I think the lead is just supposed to be a brief summary of what is in the aritcle and can ' t possibly include everything so we can use our judgement on issues like this . 	1

WTP	8840	Multiple users have agreed with me on this point , so I encourage you to expand your horizons a bit — realize there are more specific articles on WP than this one about the First Vision and how Smith was treated in the 1830s — and target your edits about specific details to articles that are about the specific events . 	0

WTP	8849	It might be notable , and if so , its existance would seem relevant here . 	0
WTP	8850	Works for me . 	0
WTP	8851	While massacres and atrocities were wrought by the crusaders , nowhere does it say that the Church called for or encouraged these massacres but just the opposite - they were appalled and the massacres worked against the goals of the church . 	0
WTP	8852	Not much more than " it exists " is relevant here , so a wikilink would be the way to go . 	1
WTP	8853	There were no criticisms of the Catholic Church in Latin America - every book spoke of the Church taking a stand in every age against the abuses brought upon the people by the Spanish conquistadores and others . 	0

WTP	8855	We have not introduced POV into this article , I intended in every way to show the bad things done by the church throughout the ages in history . 	0

WTP	8896	http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barack_Obama&diff=prev&oldid=367249190 My wording had been " exploded a Transocean drilling rig " until Scjessey ' s complaint the section was too long after which I reduced it to " exploded a Transocean rig " , which you changed to " exploded an oil rig " , which , as I ' ve already established , created an entirely new link leading to a disambiguation page . 	0
WTP	8897	As to your point about piping , I think your attitude is a little dismissive and your focus a little myopic . 	0
WTP	8898	I maintain that finding a Deepwater Horizon link within the phrase " a blowout exploded a Transocean drilling rig " is as intuitive as the example of an appropriate link at the Wikipedia : Piped link # Intuitiveness page you link for me as a tutorial , finding " Pontiac ' s Rebellion # Origins " linked within the phrase " war launched in 1763 by a loose confederation of elements of Native American tribes " . 	0
WTP	8899	Now you ' ve changed it to " an explosion destroyed an offshore rig drilling for oil " , with no link at all , again , as if you ' ve got better things to do than properly edit this featured article . 	0
WTP	8900	( If you thought it worth a link before , why not now ? ) 	0
WTP	8901	The rig was not drilling for oil when it was destroyed by the explosion , as your edit makes it sound . 	1
WTP	8902	In fact , the drilling had completely ceased , or the cementing wouldn ' t have commenced 20 hours earlier ; in fact , the rig was basically done there , and about to undergo a routine check before unhitching from the well site and making way to another drilling location . 	0

WTP	8904	Please continue to accurately relay that the UN said the statement was a clarification and not a " backing down " or however it was characterized in the press . 	0
WTP	8905	Also , the article should note that the IDF itself stated that it had fired at school premises in early reports on the matter , for example here , and your own BBCNews citation states that Israel had first stated that its mortars had caused " carnage _at_ Fakhura school " ( emphasis added ) . 	1

WTP	9038	He just had a dispute with Rev . Wright . 	0
WTP	9039	However , Obama never abandoned his religion or said he changed it . 	0
WTP	9040	Part of the problem in real life ( not saying it ' s here ) is that some want to defend Obama so much that they think he abandoned the church and want to wipe it out . 	0
WTP	9041	Obama ' s dispute was with Rev . Wright , not the religion . 	0
WTP	9042	The excuse is that it has been discussed before but what Mr . Saturn says makes sense , that he is United Church of Christ or Protestant . 	0
WTP	9043	This is strange that it list Christianity . 	1
WTP	9044	I didn ' t suggest removing the Ireland flag . 	1
WTP	9045	I suggested putting a flag in the Northern Ireland section to enhance NPOV in the section . 	0
WTP	9046	What ' s more , the technique of verse Ozzy uses at the end of that song is very much bluesy . 	0
WTP	9047	Both theories have been proven false before . 	0
WTP	9048	Either you are claiming that all phoenicians died out or that there were massive Arab migrations to what is now Lebanon . 	0
WTP	9049	I nominate the paragraph on the Veleia inscriptions for deletion . 	0
WTP	9050	First things they covered were Zeppelin and Sabbath . 	0
WTP	9051	the article is POV , i was denied multiple times to try to balance it , i did so while discussing it on the discussion page . 	0
WTP	9052	The radio programme quoted above is similar to other stuff produced on this page in that it contains no hard facts . 	0
WTP	9053	There is no scandal here in the UK despite many journalists looking for one . 	0
WTP	9054	It is primarily a US scandal , and , despite trawling the internet , no-one has produced evidence of any widespreaad world scandal . 	0
WTP	9055	The " scandal " is not " worldwide . 	1
WTP	9056	I have also noticed that the lead mention has expanded as i have predicted , and it will be cut . 	0
WTP	9057	I ' ve looked at the major Wikipedia RCC articles in other languages and none even discuss this so-called worldwide scandal , let alone have it in the lead . 	0
WTP	9058	This does not a worldwide scandal make , however , however much some people might wish one . 	0
WTP	9059	I have alrready said that in an organisation with over a million priests and religious , examples of any crime can be found if you search hard enough . 	0

WTP	9064	There are more proofs and evidence suggesting that the content is groundless and untrue manipulated by the current Iran ' s government to justify Ahmadinejad ' s preseidency given that Iranian people have respect and tendency towards educated candidates . 	0
WTP	9065	Thus claiming a ranking system in 1976 , 2 years prior to the revolution , is untrue and groundless . 	0
WTP	9066	Prior to the revolution in Iran in 1978 , each university has its own entrance exam and no ranking system even existed . 	0
WTP	9067	This was the time that the nationwide entrance exam was started as a sample of equity and justice . 	0
WTP	9068	The entrance exam and the ranking system started in 1986-1987 and after the universities re-openned . 	0
WTP	9069	5 ) Iranian universities were closed from 1980 to 1983 due to the post-revolution anarchy . 	0
WTP	9070	4 ) Even if Ahmadinejad had taken the entrance exam in 1990 with almost double population than his time in 1976 , he would have ranked among 150 , 000 and not 400 , 000 ! ! ! 	0
WTP	9071	This is based on capacities as well and the data could confirm the fact that Iranian universities have considerably higher capacities for medical and social sciences than engineering programs . 	0
WTP	9072	The statistics shows that almost always 1 / 5 apply to engineering programs , 2 / 5 social sciences and 2 / 5 medicals . 	0
WTP	9073	It ' s clear they will never admit it , so it has to be highlighted publicly . 	0
WTP	9074	Yeah , there are so many double standards on this article , and this website in general that it would take a massive overhaul of the whole system to clear out the bias of these " editors . " 	0
WTP	9075	Yes , we shouldn ' t base our information on sources that are biased in the other direction . 	0
WTP	9076	On the other hand , a quick glance here shows no mention that there is currently any link between the AGI and PPFA , nor that there has been since 1977 , when " the Alan Guttmacher Institute was incorporated as an independent , not-for-profit organization " . 	0
WTP	9077	There is no vandalism . 	0
WTP	9078	Unless you have some to back up your assertions , this discussion is a dead end . 	0
WTP	9079	" Constant internet debate " is irrelevant here . 	1
WTP	9080	Only reliable secondary sources matter . 	0
WTP	9081	This is heading in an unnecessary and unproductive direction . 	0
WTP	9082	In general , our articles about politicians try to avoid sections devoted to criticism , and avoid criticism generally , because criticism is not really a pertinent biographical fact about people unless it is tied somehow to their life . 	0
WTP	9083	Sometimes a person ' s detractors , or problematic things about them or their actions , are of biographical importance , and they can be included . 	1
WTP	9084	For example , in his book Obama recounted drug use in his youth , something that is a significant part of his life story . 	0
WTP	9085	We don ' t call it a criticism or a controversy , it is simply an event that happened . 	0
WTP	9086	Another thing we avoid is trying to balance articles about people against each other so they are equally or positive or negative . 	1
WTP	9087	It just doesn ' t work like that - we would have to calibrate Obama ' s article against not only other presidents , but all of his political rivals , those of heads of state of other countries , and so on . 	0
WTP	9088	And to what end ? 	0
WTP	9089	It is not our job here on this page to clean up the Bush article or speculate about what makes Bush a controversial figure , but if it is misfocused you are free to go there and try to improve it . 	0

WTP	9095	How exactly is the term " pro-life " not " Catholic " ? 	0
WTP	9096	As far as I know the term is a concise encapsulation of the Church ' s stance on these issues . 	0
WTP	9097	Still , I can see how the article can be improved through something like your suggested edits . 	0

WTP	9100	Multiple reverts are never a good idea on this page . 	0
WTP	9101	I don ' t think this content currently can be improved by editing , and the moment it is improved by removal as it isn ' t supported . 	0

WTP	9103	Maybe an article about weapon unloading . 	0
WTP	9104	Maybe in another article , although I can ' t think of one where it would be directly relevant at this point . 	0
WTP	9105	Therefore , it should not be in such a visible article . 	0
WTP	9106	It is clear that anyone not living in Israel would not correctly interpret this picture . 	0
WTP	9107	The patrol is in the territories , so the locals would obviously be settlers , but this is not about " cooperation with settler groups " . 	0
WTP	9108	From what I can tell from the picture , it ' s a joint patrol / weapon unloading by the IDF and local security forces , and this has nothing to do with the " settlement movement " or anything of the sort . 	0
WTP	9109	The above comment shows exactly why this picture shouldn ' t be in this article , as it can be broadly , and incorrectly , interpreted . 	1
WTP	9110	The object of a " theory " is to enduce debate , which in turn stimulates research and which in return bears fruit in the form of a " fact " , creativity is more important that knowledge ( " Einstein " ) . 	0
WTP	9111	Youre a braver man than I am , Roland , for signing with your name to what you just said . 	0
WTP	9112	I believe that aptitude would go further in real life , this write fest has certainly " evolved " into a one hell of a discussion , 	0
WTP	9113	Catholic Charities is one of the largest charities in the United States , I think it is in the top ten - per a Forbes article referenced on its wikipedia page . 	0
WTP	9114	I would also like to point out that the good things the church does - its current missions , orphanages , schools , universities , Catholic Charities and Catholic Releif Services only get passing mention with no elaboration on the vast number - millions of people helped by the church currently each year . 	0
WTP	9115	- - 	0
WTP	9116	While the LGBT population of San Francisco is certainly one of its most internationally recognizable elements , it is one aspect of the many things that are recognizable about San Francisco and should probably be included in the lead , I would prefer that all the items listed there maintain a parallel structure . 	0
WTP	9117	The final paragraph in the lead does not need to have an overly technical representation of the gay and lesbian population of San Francisco . 	1
WTP	9118	The section has been treated no differently than any other paragraph that has contained criticism of the church . 	0
WTP	9119	Entropy1 , don ' t let me discourage you from trying to improve this article , but in this case I think you are trying to introduce conclusions that are not supported by mainstream scholars , including Mormon mainstream historians like Richard Bushman . 	0
WTP	9120	But the proposed material here , such as the newspaper articles , is not appropriate in this article . 	1
WTP	9121	The First Vision is a very important part of post-1900 Mormonism . 	0
WTP	9122	if the tone of my edits was not neutral ( this is how X is called by Y ) , or if my attempt to clarify the reasoning of ( X ) why it / they use this name were offending , then that should be discussed on this page or modified accordingly in the article ! 	0
WTP	9123	but it was removed and the removal reasoning was not clarified here and the discussion was left open because chose not to take part of the discussion ! 	0
WTP	9124	in that sense the article is not balanced , although i would say that as far as i can see , it does not introduce false information , but it defiantly shuts off a whole perspective of it ! 	1
WTP	9125	I agree . 	0
WTP	9126	It requires that all majority - and significant-minority views be presented fairly , in a disinterested tone , and in rough proportion to their prevalence within the source material . " , the last post in the discussion ( before my responses regarding the discussion ) was by Sean . hoyland , i confirmed to the constructive input that shows that no one but i agrees that the term IOF should be used in the intro , it is clear that this term is not welcomed by some editors , and seems offensive to some , never the less , it still represents a major perspective that the article is completely ignoring ! 	0
WTP	9127	regardless whether we agree on it or not ! 	0
WTP	9128	Can you please clarify how i am vandalizing the article ? 	0
WTP	9129	but lets not get drifted off the topic here , i will quote " The neutral point of view is a means of dealing with conflicting perspectives on a topic as evidenced by reliable sources . 	0
WTP	9130	Though I deeply respect my former professor Anderson , I don ' t think we can make much use of his BYU Studies article in Wikipedia , given that no non-Mormon scholar agrees with the underlying conclusion of his article . 	1
WTP	9131	frankly I ' m offended by you calling my edits vandalism ! 	0
WTP	9132	but i would rather keep the discussion revolving around the core issue of this discussion . 	0
WTP	9133	Thus , Obama ' s and most other Democrats pages stay clean . 	0
WTP	9134	They simply put you , me or anybody else who tries for a legitimate edit , through what is obviously a run-around , until we give up . 	0
WTP	9135	They are clearly biased . 	0
