MT	0	That ' s costly ! 	0
MT	1	Fees result in longer durations of studies . 	0
MT	2	Studying and taking higher degrees must remain a basic right for everyone . 	0
MT	3	Tuition fees should not be charged in Germany . 	1
MT	4	Supermarkets and shopping centres should be allowed to open any Sundays and holidays at their discretion . 	1
MT	5	For in this way , Sunday shopping days would be better spread out through the year . 	0
MT	6	Also streets and shops would presumably be emptier as not everyone would be open on the same day . 	0
MT	7	However then you ' d have a worse overview of which shop is open on a given day . 	0
MT	8	Courts are also subject to human error . 	0
MT	9	No human being or human committee should again be given the permission to rule over ' life or death ' . 	0
MT	10	Every human , even those who have committed a despicable crime , can bring themselves to regret and change their opinion . 	0
MT	11	That ' s why Germany should not introduce capital punishment ! 	1
MT	12	A door must remain open for making amends . 	0
MT	13	Of course there are a number of programmes in public broadcasting that are not worth the licencing fee , and others , such as “ Musikantenstadl ” and soap operas , are only interesting to certain audiences . 	0
MT	14	Nevertheless , everybody should contribute to the funding of the public broadcasters in equal measure , for we need general and independent media . 	1
MT	15	After all we want to get our view of the world neither through the lens of the government nor through that of rich media entrepreneurs . 	0
MT	16	Their tools , data and expertise have been used to keep us under surveillance for a long time . 	0
MT	17	Having said that , state funds are often wasted on nonsensical investments , so that this ideal appears unworthy of support in many ways . 	0
MT	18	Besides , the trading of information is obviously driven by greed of gain . 	0
MT	19	It is desirable that no one channels his or her wealth past the tax authorities . 	0
MT	20	Those who do or try to should be held accountable if at all possible . 	0
MT	21	Tax data that are not made available for free should therefore not be acquired by the state . 	1
MT	22	Despite the severe clashes in Kiev , which at times have threatened to escalate , the EU should not intervene in local politics . 	1
MT	23	Although Ukraine is a European country , and the Ukrainian opposition is primarily interested in installing a robust democracy , possible supporters face a considerably stronger opponent in the intervention of Russia in local politics . 	0
MT	24	It doesn ' t matter after all that those who administer the treatment don ' t have ' doctor status ' . 	0
MT	25	Besides it should be in the interest of the health insurers to recognize alternative medicine as treatment , since there is a chance of recovery . 	0
MT	26	Alternative treatments should be subsidized in the same way as conventional treatments , since both methods can lead to the prevention , mitigation or cure of an illness . 	1
MT	27	Since however skat , chess etc . are not accepted as Olympic events , computer games should also not be recognized as Olympic events . 	1
MT	28	Our society is strongly digitized and influenced by computers . 	0
MT	29	Yet sports are usually associated with physical training . 	0
MT	30	Olympic events are rooted in old traditions . 	0
MT	31	On the other hand , the events have a culturally determined character . 	0
MT	32	The statutory health insurance companies should also cover treatments with non-medical and alternative practitioners . 	1
MT	33	Their treatment methods and successes are not amply researched or proven . 	0
MT	34	Yet many patients subjectively experience relief or are cured of their complaints , which ultimately also saves costs for conventional treatments and medication . 	0
MT	35	Also conventional medicine is in many cases not successful , and , moreover , entails significant risks and side effects . 	0
MT	36	To oblige non-academics to finance others ' degrees through taxes , however , is not just . 	0
MT	37	As long as it is ensured that the funds really benefit the universities directly , one can continue to regard this as social justice . 	0
MT	38	Actually it would be justified if all German universities charged tuition fees . 	1
MT	39	It ' s always possible to take out a student loan or to earn a scholarship . 	0
MT	40	Those who study later decide this early on , anyway . 	0
MT	41	Granted , those concern primarily the British and American intelligence services , but the German services evidently do collaborate with them closely . 	0
MT	42	Intelligence services must urgently be regulated more tightly by parliament ; this should be clear to everyone after the disclosures of Edward Snowden . 	1
MT	43	' Property entails commitment ' is one of the tenets of our social order . 	0
MT	44	Everyone should be able to get the utmost profit from his or her property . 	0
MT	45	A fixing of rent prices according to the market alone , however , will lead to a further division of society . 	0
MT	46	The rich and poor live in different neighbourhoods . 	0
MT	47	A constant increase in rent upon a change of tenants hence cannot be desired by society . 	1
OC	48	People sitting right there in the ground . 	0
OC	49	Just walk , stone to stone , and read all those people ' s names . 	0

OC	208	as a person with a folklore degree , they ' re kinda slavery era in that when joel chandler harris collected them they were told him by a black male who was either a neighbor or a servant of the family ( i suddenly can ' t recall which ) . 	0
OC	209	really the stories are variations on african folk tales , existing american folktales ( like jack tales ) and some elements and stories were " created " so to speak or altered during the slave years , but not all of them . 	0
OC	210	they ' re really a mishmash of traditional stories , especially trickster tales and the trickster in every other element of american and really every society is an admired figure who sticks it to the status quo . 	0
OC	211	they ' re cautionary tales and fables as well - it ' s sad that they ' re dismissed so readily by people who ' ve probably never even read them . 	0
OC	212	they definately do not promote or condone slavery in the least - if anything they ' re against it , as the hoovmeister said . 	1
OC	213	all folktales , regardless of when they were created or under what circumstances , are an integral element of our society and to ignore them or media stemming from them is doing a serious disservice to our youth . 	0
OC	214	it saddens me that folklore ' s basically dying out between the encroaching technology and political correctness . 	0
OC	215	in terms of the uncle tom-like remus as lucas mentioned , you rarely saw beatings and uprising in folktales - folk songs , yes - folk tales , not so much . 	0

OC	914	Shit you have a very cool journel man you are just one talented guy . 	0
OC	915	I added you . 	0
OC	916	You better work your way up ; - ) 	0
OC	917	You ' re probably one of the few people who became virgins by virtue of being experienced . 	0
OC	918	Yeah , but . . . you ' re a better reason than not proving the bastards at my high school right . 	0
OC	919	It ' s possible when the chief exorcist says " the Devil lodges in the Vatican " he means that , literally , the Devil is possessing members of the Church . 	1
OC	920	Theoretically they ' re supposed to require a high level of evidence of infernal intervention before involving themselves . 	0
OC	921	It ' s the job of these guys to differentiate between " Man , that dude is an asshole " and " this person is literally being possessed by a fallen angel , and we must cast the demon out ! " 	0
OC	922	It carries a different implication when an exorcist says it , though . 	0
OC	923	Either way , it ' s ludicrously alarmist and a little nuts . 	0
OC	924	It ' s what he should mean in using that language , given his job . 	0
OC	925	I actually like his guitar playing , but I find the oud distracting and the songs repetitive . 	0
OC	926	Basically the most famous Turkish pop star from the 70 ' s as far as I know . 	0
OC	927	He ' s Turkish . 	0
OC	928	People I never knew . 	0
PE	929	For the above reasons , I agree that distance education can ' t replace traditional school . 	1
PE	930	To begin with , going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language . 	1
PE	931	In March 2003 , a lab technician shot a video inside a lab , which revealed primates in cages without pain medication , for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head . 	0
PE	932	Recent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly , which influences their reactions to drugs . 	0
PE	933	Some people choose to be normal to wait for chances , while some other people prefer to be different from everyone else . 	0
PE	934	Which one is the promising way to succeed ? 	0
PE	935	As living in a competent world , we are like playing a survival game . 	0
PE	936	Consideration is always important in relationship . 	0
PE	937	In the meantime , communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate . 	1
PE	938	Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine . 	0
PE	939	For example , roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time . 	0
PE	940	Much has been said about the importance about good roommates and how roommates will affect our life in school . 	0
PE	941	Roommates quality and their importance 	0
PE	942	In my personal opinion , the most important quality of roommates is being considered . 	1
PE	943	Research showed that friends that we made in university are more likely to be life time friends and this especially applicable to roommate . 	0
PE	944	Therefore , having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life . 	1
PE	945	At all times , think about the other ' s feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously . 	0
PE	946	If there are more people in the cities , there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road , which causes air pollution . 	0
PE	947	Additionally , it might put strain on the environment . 	0
PE	948	In my opinion , however , I do not approve of this trend due to negative effects such as low quality of life and affecting the environment . 	1
PE	949	In conclusion , young people tend to study or work in urban areas since these provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials . 	1
PE	950	Secondly , animals are kept in unnatural conditions . 	0
PE	951	Animal testing costs an enormous amount of money , since they must be fed , cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances . 	0
PE	952	Every year , cosmetic companies , farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products , without any beneficial result . 	0
PE	953	Perhaps the most serious problem facing the animals ' rights today is animal experimentation . 	0
PE	954	For example , if someone tells a kid that something is wrong and they shouldn ' t do it , but his father told him / her that it was right , the kid will listen to the father instead of the other person , even if his father is wrong . 	0
PE	955	More power than any friend or other adult could have . 	0
PE	956	They have more contact and more intimacy with their children . 	0
PE	957	Secondly , a child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people , so their parents have more time to teach him / her than anybody else . 	1
PE	958	I completely agree that parents are the best teacher . 	1
PE	959	Parents are the best teachers because they are more special than everybody else 	0
PE	960	Firstly , the things that parents say have great power to their child . 	1
PE	961	Children normally think that their parents are somehow special and that makes them the most important people in the children ’ s lives . 	1
PE	962	That ’ s as important thing because even if the parents don ’ t intend to teach their children something , they are always observing and learning by themselves . 	0
PE	963	Lastly , children usually mirror themselves on their parents . 	1
PE	964	Moreover , parents provide their children the best social skills and knowledge in order to prepare for their children ' s future life . 	1
PE	965	It is obvious that parents are the first teachers who teach babies how to walk and speak and make children to become a good person . 	1
PE	966	If you want to stay healthy , be yourself and spend time with your family and friends , then you should spend less time watching these media . 	0
PE	967	Television and movies nowadays contain a lot of advertisements . 	0
PE	968	These advertisements build ideal images that make people to feel bad about themselves and want to be more like these images . 	1
PE	969	They communicate less with their parents because a lot of their time is used watching television and movies . 	0
PE	970	When people are watching television or movies together , they also talk less to each other , compare to when playing social games , such as parlor games , together . 	0
PE	971	When a cool hero characters in a movie smokes and yet a lot of people like him , then people who idolize him may also begin to smoke although they don ’ t prefer it . 	0
PE	972	I think television and movies are entertaining but most of the time they influence people ’ s behavior in bad ways . 	1
PE	973	When people see beautiful women and men on the advertisements , they think that they are ugly . 	0
PE	974	Thus they spend a lot of money to buy a lot of beauty products or go to gym to get better appearance or body . 	0
PE	975	Admittedly , the government should give priority to public services and facilities . 	0
PE	976	This is because the government plays the role of a leader among citizens , which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable . 	0
PE	977	Simultaneously , public services such as education system or medical care can meet people ' s basic demand of survival , security and knowledge , thus making them feel comfortable , which can lower the crime rate . 	0
PE	978	Therefore , public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability . 	1
PE	979	Government should spend money on ARTs , not only on public services 	0
PE	980	As people have raised their democratic awareness in recent years , they are caring more about how the tax expenditure is distributed by the government . 	0
PE	981	As a result , some people suggest that the tax money should be allocated to publically beneficial services instead of arts . 	0
PE	982	However , from my perspective , I think arts are supposed to be included in the government ' s investment as well . 	1
PE	983	On the other hand , I believe arts should by no means been disregarded by the government . 	1
PE	984	Individually , arts can enrich people ' s cultural lives . 	0
PE	985	Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards . 	0
PE	986	For example , the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams . 	0
PE	987	Fossil fuels will soon be replaced ? 	0
PE	988	Although renewable resources of energy are elements of the current and future energy strategy , as far as I ' m concerned , these new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases , oil , and coal . 	1
PE	989	Firstly , due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive . 	1
PE	990	Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford . 	0
PE	991	On the other hand , fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas . 	0
PE	992	For example , it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy , say expensive solar batteries and wind farms . 	0
PE	993	Thus the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming . 	0
PE	994	Besides , although utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly ; these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think . 	1
PE	995	In other words , I think the best way of communication is by means of face-to-face . 	1
PE	996	Based on the reasons demonstrated above , I prefer to express my opinion in person because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite . 	1
PE	997	Talking without scruple is not the indispensable part in communication ; in contrast , it is usually detrimental to us . 	0
PE	998	It is conceivable that before we talk , it is necessary for us to be imprudent about our words . 	0
PE	999	Still , I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent . 	0
PE	1000	It is not to say , of course , that other points of view are completely without merit . 	0
PE	1001	Development through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors , lawyers or engineers . 	0
PE	1002	Basic education teaches one child to read and write . 	0
PE	1003	Supplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information . 	0
PE	1004	A further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self-sufficient . 	0
PE	1005	A well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment . 	0
PE	1006	In the same way , a skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society . 	0
PE	1007	Collectively , the benefits of education can make a man , a society and a developed country . 	1
PE	1008	In conclusion , education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country . 	1
PE	1009	The more people in the country become educated , the better chance it can develop . 	1
PE	1010	Businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life 	0
PE	1011	Many entrepreneurs hypothesize that it is safer to hire employees for their entire lives in order to ensure the productivity and efficiency of working . 	0
PE	1012	From my perspective , those assumptions are not only conservative but also out-of-date . 	0
PE	1013	First and foremost , various ideas and creativity from different people are indispensable for a company to flourish . 	1
PE	1014	Therefore , the youngsters are capable of meeting those standards . 	0
PE	1015	More importantly , they have activeness , inventiveness and enterprise which allow them to complete their jobs perfectly . 	0
PE	1016	These vital factors can decide whether the company can thrive or not . 	0
PE	1017	Thus , easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human ' s health . 	1
PE	1018	Are museums necessary ? 	0
PE	1019	In order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits , museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing . 	1
PE	1020	However , people may not get a spiritual experience since pictures online are only limited to a screen size . 	0
PE	1021	Third , it is clear that parents are ones who loves their children most and always take care of their children . 	0
PE	1022	In conclusion , parents are really the best teachers who give us much knowledge and advice . 	1
PE	1023	Based on love , they always try their best to make good condition for their children development in order to prepare children ' s future life . 	0
PE	1024	Unfortunately nowadays most of them pick up this profit without sharing a small sum of it with their workers , and from my point of view it is unfair . 	0
PE	1025	What is more , when people work for themselves they make more profit for themselves , but in the other jobs you make profits for the other such as your manager . 	1
PE	1026	You always have to be responsible for your task , and it make a stressful situation that I never like it . 	0
PE	1027	In your job you can be boss of yourself ; however , in the other jobs someone else are your boss . 	0
PE	1028	In the first place , there are a large number of opportunities in privat works that you cannot find them when you work for the others . 	1
PE	1029	There are many benefits when people work for themselves rather than work for the others . 	0
PE	1030	Although both companies have their advantages and disadvantages , I would prefer to work for myself , and have my own business . 	1
PE	1031	Some of them are done by companies that related to government , and some of them are done by privat companies . 	0
PE	1032	There are many kinds of jobs in society . 	0
PE	1033	Some prefer to work for a company , some prefer to work for themselves 	0
PE	1034	In other words , reducing risks and enhancing individual ' s capability is the most important path to success . 	0
PE	1035	Based on the reasons demonstrated above , I believe that doing what we already known can still leads us to succeed because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the opposite . 	1
PE	1036	Still , I am firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent . 	0
PE	1037	It is not to say , of course , that other points of view are completely without merit . 	0
PE	1038	Therefore they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living . 	1
PE	1039	Obviously , many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career . 	0
PE	1040	There can be no doubt that the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities . 	0
PE	1041	TV has adverse effects on friends and family 	0
PE	1042	I know someone who wakes up in the morning and before even eat he turns the television on , he even records the programs he cannot watch during work hours . 	0
PE	1043	Some People spend a lot of time watching television , others even eat watching television , and some others make of this media a priority . 	1
PE	1044	Sometimes his wife wants to talk before they go to work , but he only let her talk during commercials . 	0
PE	1045	People have a lot of things to learn in their lives . 	0
PE	1046	Therefore , I agree that Television has destroyed communication among friends and family . 	1
PE	1047	One of this resource is television ; however television has some negative effects among some people . 	0
PE	1048	Nowdays there are different resources to entertain , educate and inform people . 	0
PE	1049	First of all , some people spend a lot of time watching television . 	1
PE	1050	So , she is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email . 	0
PE	1051	Firstly , education is an essential part in development . 	0
PE	1052	This will be proven by analyzing the necessity of developing their education and the real objective of supporters . 	0
PE	1053	As I have said , television is a great tool to learn , entertain and inform what is happening , but I agree that television has destroyed communication among friends and family as soon as television become a priority , spend a lot of time watching it and eat in front of the television . 	1
PE	1054	For instance , most developing countries are lack of educational resources , such as experienced teachers , evaluation systems and teaching facilities , which is usually neglected by local authorities . 	0
PE	1055	In most countries , it makes up a considerable part of its national budget yearly . 	0
PE	1056	Education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country 	0
PE	1057	There are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities . 	0
PE	1058	In a developing country , not many can afford to send their children to school . 	0
PE	1059	These children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen , can hardly eat three meals a day , let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday . 	0
PE	1060	As a result , these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents . 	1
PE	1061	Education is undeniably an economic necessity . 	0
PE	1062	I believe that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country . 	1
PE	1063	The lower the factors making us fail we have , the higher probability to success we own . 	0
PE	1064	I favor the latter ; that is , successful people still do things they already know . 	1
PE	1065	The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that to be successful , we all try to reduce the risk we might encounter . 	0
PE	1066	Some people tend to believe that to be successful , they should do something they are unfamiliar with , while others seem to stand on the opposite place . 	0
PE	1067	After deeply pondering over this issue , I develop my own perspective as well . 	0
PE	1068	Successful people do something new or take risks 	0
PE	1069	There is a hotly debated issue over whether successful people usually take risk or try new things , and the topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity . 	0
PE	1070	He can focus on certain companies which he thinks is worth it to invest , and then just waits for the not so high but constant income . 	0
PE	1071	He does not have to invest some dangerous companies to get higher profit which might lead him to bankrupt in a short time . 	0
PE	1072	While if you " visit " the museum online , you may not able to get this kind of experience . 	0
PE	1073	For example , at American Museum of Natural History , you can make a bone-by-bone reproduction of the museum ' s stegosaurus ; at Museum of Art in New York , you can look at 17th century instruments while listening to their music . 	0
PE	1074	I believe public museums and art galleries will still be necessary , even though we can see the art works and historical objects online . 	1
PE	1075	Prepared Food 	0
PE	1076	Nowadays , more and more people begin to select prepared food as their daily meals , since it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society . 	1
PE	1077	However it is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients , ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people ' s eating habits . 	1
PE	1078	In this essay , I would like to explain why this is not a good thing based on the three reasons above . 	0
PE	1079	First of all , to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious , almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people . 	0
PE	1080	Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences . 	0
PE	1081	Also , when there is a dinner with friends , some people do not have a fluid conversation because the television is again in between them . 	0
PE	1082	This is the time , when if they have children , they can share everything about school , a project and even concerns . 	0
PE	1083	Another way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family . 	1
PE	1084	Time with the family is gold , some people have to realize that and take quality of time to talk to them . 	0
PE	1085	Honestly , I was in shock ! 	0
PE	1086	I remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night . 	0
PE	1087	Finally , some people make the television a priority . 	1
PE	1088	When family or friends gather together to have a good time eating and talking , this is not the reality in some cases . 	0
PE	1089	People cannot live a harmonious life if citizens do not have a decent place to live in . 	0
PE	1090	If the price of housing grows continuously , a comfortable place to live in will be a luxury to the middle class and the low class . 	0
PE	1091	What government should take into consideration at the first place should not be historic and traditional building preservation but new building construction . 	1
PE	1092	How she could say that to me ? . 	0
PE	1093	And the cost of accommodation keeps growing these years . 	0
PE	1094	The necessity of governmental financial aid is extremely important . 	0
PE	1095	New building construction hold the right to gain more money from government 	0
PE	1096	The housing shortage is drawing more and more attention nowadays . 	0
PE	1097	Then , ordinary people , especially the younger generation , will fall into a certain pattern - work , pay bills for housing , work ; and I am sure that it will increase people ' s dissatisfaction of the government . 	0
PE	1098	Because when they are working , the fair of losing their accommodation always lingers , which will limit their efficiency . 	0
PE	1099	In highly industrialized countries , undertakings are made to make it accessible and affordable to all . 	0
PE	1100	They are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands . 	0
PE	1101	For example , I have a close friend who was in the same department with me in the university . 	0
PE	1102	Thus renewable resources are not as reliable as we think . 	0
PE	1103	Admittedly contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain , deduction of ozone layer and global warming ; these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions . 	1
PE	1104	This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds . 	0
PE	1105	More importantly , the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up ; leaving problems for the following generations . 	0
PE	1106	With these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable . 	0
PE	1107	In conclusion as promising as renewable resources of energy sound , there is no way those new forms of energy will replace fossil fuels soon . 	1
PE	1108	For example we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain . 	0
PE	1109	These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy . 	0
PE	1110	As an engineering researcher , I will surely be disappointed for failure , and exited for new challenges . 	0
PE	1111	Just like a song , if I did not have challenge , life would be blue . 	0
PE	1112	Doing different tasks makes employees and employers much happier . 	0
PE	1113	While when it comes to " happier " , different type of jobs can be responsible factor . 	0
PE	1114	Although they can be familiar with their job , changing of job is what serve to their happier . 	0
PE	1115	Workers , who work for an ordinary company or industry , will be sick of same tasks day by day . 	0
PE	1116	To set another example , consider every workers have ability to do several kinds of work , employers will be satisfied by the generating benefits . 	0
PE	1117	Changing the type of work will be fresh and elicit their potential to adapt a new environment , which , according to psychology theories , makes workers relaxed and happier . 	1
PE	1118	Different types of tasks during workday brings more challenges , making life colorful . 	0
PE	1119	They both will be happy because the change of job , not the same task day by day . 	0
PE	1120	These examples make it obvious that great achievement needs someone keen on one task for long time . 	1
PE	1121	Gandhi devoted his whole life to fight against British-ruled government and inspire movements for civil rights in India , finally he became the father of the nation . 	0
PE	1122	Most of workers have adapted to do same task . 	0
PE	1123	While there are innumerous people will deem it ridiculous and argue doing the same task is the meaning of job , but from my perspective , I am on the side of my father . 	0
PE	1124	As a authoritative dentist in my province , my mother has worked for 25 years . 	0
PE	1125	It allows us to achieve more . 	0
PE	1126	In my family , the argument topic between my father and mother always involves my father ' s job . 	0
PE	1127	Different types of tasks endow more colors to our life 	0
PE	1128	Every time I asked him why , he will say , seriously , " I am done , doing this same work for 20 years and I really want to try some different , that is all . " 	0
PE	1129	Five years ago , he quitted his 20 years job as an architectural engineer , and became a landscape painter . 	0
PE	1130	Studying alone at home might deprive us of these significant and valuable opportunities . 	0
PE	1131	For example , students may learn how to cooperate with classmates from teamwork . 	0
PE	1132	We can learn a lot from programs at home ; however , our computers or televisions can ' t teach us how to get along with people . 	0
PE	1133	Furthermore , there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization - establishes relationship with classmates . 	1
PE	1134	If you are the type that gets easily distracted , a distance-learning program may not be for you . 	0
PE	1135	Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision . 	1
PE	1136	Unlike traditional classes , distance education courses don ' t take place in a classroom , where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates . 	0
PE	1137	Second , studying at home is very different from traditional learning . 	0
PE	1138	Unfortunately , it may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help . 	0
PE	1139	Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects . 	1
PE	1140	Besides , in the far future , they become more valuable . 	0
PE	1141	On the other side , most sports facilities except buildings are usually can be used in short-time and they are not persistent for a long-time . 	0
PE	1142	To conclude , there are good ways for sports activities to compensate their expenses , but it is very hard for libraries to find a good way for have an income . 	1
PE	1143	Last but not least , investing in libraries has a long-time result . 	1
PE	1144	For example , a library can buy a lot of new books or they can buy more computers . 	0
PE	1145	Most of the library facilities are stable and you can use them for a long time . 	0
PE	1146	Most libraries are free not for students also for public . 	0
PE	1147	Hence , universities support is vital for libraries . 	0
PE	1148	But sport activities have a good income because every sport has different matches and for each match they have a lot sponsors . 	0
PE	1149	Also , they have this chance to sell their important matches tickets . 	0
PE	1150	To begin with , outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage . 	1
PE	1151	Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached . 	0
PE	1152	Besides , it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done . 	0
PE	1153	To be precise , such abstract or complicated informatin , easily absorbed by those students , may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills . 	0
PE	1154	Universtiy is an entrance to life . 	0
PE	1155	University education restriction 	0
PE	1156	It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people . 	0
PE	1157	It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed . 	0
PE	1158	However , university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills . 	0
PE	1159	University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain . 	0
PE	1160	Consequently , we should pay more attention to adjust people ' s behaviors in order to reduce crimes instead of gun control . 	0
PE	1161	On the other hand , criminal mind seems to be more related to violence . 	1
PE	1162	All in all , it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate . 	1
PE	1163	They should try and keep trying until they learn what they want to learn . 	0
PE	1164	People should not depend only on reading or listening to people talking about things to learn . 	0
PE	1165	The history shows that learning by doing things is the best way and the best method to learn things . 	1
PE	1166	As studies have shown that the rate of obesity in children has increased every year , it will be very beneficial for children to have a daily physical activity and get a break from being sitting several hours at school . 	0
PE	1167	Physical activity helps children to grow up physically healthier . 	1
PE	1168	Daily exercise will help also to develop children ' s brain function . 	1
PE	1169	In addition , exercise will help them to not be less exposed to illness related with cardiovascular , higher blood and cholesterol issues . 	0
PE	1170	Although some people believe that students should spend the whole day on academic studies , I nevertheless believe that physical exercise is a crucial part of every school day . 	1
PE	1171	Physical exercise should be required part of every school day 	0
PE	1172	In addition , including exercise in children ' s daily routine , it is a good way to teach them the importance of physical activity from an early age . 	1
PE	1173	Exercise is good not only for having a good health body , but also for the mind . 	1
PE	1174	When people exercise , the respiratory system ' s function is enhanced , helping all organs , including the brain , to get more oxygen in . 	0
PE	1175	It is well known how important it is to exercise regularly to help the body system to work better . 	0
PE	1176	Once you are unique enough , you are already on the way to success 	0
PE	1177	Achieving success is everybody ' s goal for life and there are absolutely many different directions that can lead people to success . 	0
PE	1178	In my opinion , I believe that once you are unique enough , you are already on the way to success . 	1
PE	1179	First , being positively different from everyone else usually means that you ' ve achieved something that is superior than others . 	0
PE	1180	Consider a circumstance in which one person is rich because he knows a lot of knowledge of investment . 	0
PE	1181	We can browse the art work from all over the world at home . 	0
PE	1182	Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work because the Internet really brings them convenience . 	1
PE	1183	First , children are taught basic things , which influence their whole life , by their parents . 	1
PE	1184	Are parents best teachers ? 	0
PE	1185	Consequently , parents bring the whole world of wonderful and colorful thing into their baby ' s little mind . 	0
PE	1186	Second , parents train their child how to become a good person . 	1
PE	1187	As a baby , they do not know any thing all around but they learn everything from their parents . 	0
PE	1188	Parents always try to explain and describe tenderly all things in simple way so that their baby can understand and learn from that . 	0
PE	1189	They always make their children basically say thanks and apology in the right way . 	0
PE	1190	On the one hand , it is common that they try to explain who is a good or bad person . 	0
PE	1191	For example , only when we see the real mummy , can we experience mystique . 	0
PE	1192	Therefore , if a government wants to control crime in a community , it is important to manage their people ' s actions rather than gun used in violent crimes . 	1
PE	1193	As a result , the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself . 	0
PE	1194	By contrast , the exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling . 	0
PE	1195	First of all , it seems to be true that if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease because fewer guns available mean less crime . 	1
PE	1196	To some extent , I do not agree with this assertion because I believe that criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control . 	1
PE	1197	Some people may argue that allowing policemen to carries firearms can increase violence in the society . 	0
PE	1198	Gun control and increasing violence 	0
PE	1199	Moreover , there will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world , either polices or common citizens . 	0
PE	1200	People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns , regardless of gun control . 	0
PE	1201	In fact , stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally . 	1
PE	1202	However , this is not as simple as it sounds . 	0
PE	1203	In addition , it is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world . 	0
PE	1204	Thus , the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid . 	0
PE	1205	As is commonly understood , there is an increasingly gap between developed countries and developing countries . 	0
PE	1206	Financial aid to develop countries 	0
PE	1207	However , it is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries . 	1
PE	1208	It can be seen that some developed countries and organization are proving financial assistance to the impoverished countries . 	0
PE	1209	From this example , it is obvious that if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education , the developing countries will remain undeveloped , even though they gain a great deal of economic support . 	1
PE	1210	For instance , there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases . 	0
PE	1211	Not cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition . 	1
PE	1212	It is true that cooking prepared food needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food . 	0
PE	1213	I believe that the brilliant bosses are conscious of the need for giving opportunities to diverse employees . 	1
PE	1214	Firstly , international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country ’ s economy in order to serve various demands of tourists . 	0
PE	1215	While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries , I would contend that it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations . 	1
PE	1216	The last decade has seen an increasing number of tourists traveling to visit natural wonder sights , ancient heritages and different cultures around the world . 	0
PE	1217	International tourism is now more common than ever before 	0
PE	1218	Secondly , through tourism industry , many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected . 	0
PE	1219	Therefore tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country . 	1
PE	1220	These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard . 	0
PE	1221	Take Cambodia for example , a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants , hotels , souvenir shops and other stores . 	0
PE	1222	Without this support and profit from tourism , many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works . 	0
PE	1223	For instance , in Vietnam , many cultural costumes and natural scenes , namely ‘ Trong Dong ’ drum performance and ‘ Ha Long ’ bay , are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry . 	0
PE	1224	Building more accommodating constructions meets people ' s basic need . 	1
PE	1225	In this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self-study . 	0
PE	1226	Finally yet importantly , appearing in class makes students more conscientious since they have to obey class ’ s disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments . 	1
PE	1227	However , if they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems . 	0
PE	1228	Another significant fact which should be taken into consideration is that by the help of teachers , students can understand ideas faster and easier since teachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points . 	1
PE	1229	First and foremost , I truly believe that being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college . 	1
PE	1230	Also , they can help each other for learning materials better . 	0
PE	1231	On the contrary to this popular belief , there are still those who subscribe to this view that having a choice for attending classes enable students to study at home and through this way they do not waste their time for commuting and also they can save their money . 	0
PE	1232	However , I am inclined to believe that being present at classes seems a wiser option . 	1
PE	1233	Students should attend to classes or it should be optional ? 	0
PE	1234	Nowadays , it is often claimed that attending classes has a lot of benefits for students and provide them with a variety of learning opportunities ( options ) as well . 	0
PE	1235	Television and Movies influence our lives both negatively and positively 	0
PE	1236	There is no doubt that television or movies influence people ’ s behavior and they influence us in both bad ways and good ways . 	0
PE	1237	But I think in general television and movies influence our behavior in bad ways more than in good ways . 	1
PE	1238	They make people to eat more rubbish food , spend less time with their friends and family , and be someone that are not themselves . 	1
PE	1239	There are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television . 	1
PE	1240	Most of the foods they eat are fat foods like chips or pizzas . 	0
PE	1241	It is not rocket science to know that these foods are not good for people ’ s health . 	0
PE	1242	Many companies know about this behavior and use advertisements on television to make people buy more of these foods . 	0
PE	1243	In turn , people will consume these rubbish foods more and we have to deal with a lot of fat diseases . 	0
PE	1244	Television and movies also make people to spend more time on their couch than with their family and friends , especially children . 	1
PE	1245	Of course , effective cooperation can make things easier and faster , but in many important cases when team-working is not possible , the ability to work alone will help . 	0
PE	1246	What is more , the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry . 	0
PE	1247	There is no deny that the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture , real estate industry and industry , in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy , because they produce plenty of profits . 	0
PE	1248	First , land used for farmland , housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society . 	0
PE	1249	The reasons are based on the following aspects . 	0
PE	1250	As far as I am concerned , I agree with the opinion human needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important . 	1
PE	1251	People who disagree with the point dispute that the decreasing of land for endangered animals will bring damage to ecological balance . 	0
PE	1252	Nowadays , there is a prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals . 	0
PE	1253	Farmland , housing and industry or saving land for animals ? 	0
PE	1254	Thus the needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important . 	1
PE	1255	It is widely acknowledged that more farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate . 	0
PE	1256	In conclusion , working with a group a people and working individually are all important . 	0
PE	1257	Both skills are necessary for a successful life . 	0
PE	1258	Nevertheless , the capablity of working alone is the foundation for the skill to work in team and plays a significant role in a lot of situations . 	1
PE	1259	Working in team does not mean that you do not have to come up with your ideas . 	0
PE	1260	Everybody in a team must have his / her own opinion first , then discuss them with other members . 	0
PE	1261	When we work in team , we still think individually because our brain are not connected but separate . 	0
PE	1262	When everyone in a team can come up with his / her own ideas , working in team will definitely more effective . 	0
PE	1263	More convincing 	0
PE	1264	There is a hotly debated issue over whether face-to-face communication is better than other kinds of communication , and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity . 	0
PE	1265	Some people tend to believe that communication in person is the best way of expression , while others seem to stand on the opposite position . 	0
PE	1266	After deeply pondering over this issue , I also develop my own perspective . 	0
PE	1267	I favor the former ; that is , I agree that face-to-face communication is better . 	1
PE	1268	The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that communicating in person can be more convincing . 	0
PE	1269	He once complained a service of a restaurant . 	0
PE	1270	Without exaggeration , he directly went to the boss and told the boss that something wrong occurred on the meal--a fly concealed in it . 	0
PE	1271	Afterward , my uncle acquired a new service thanks to face-to face communication . 	0
PE	1272	Some details might be dim since the resolution ratio of the screen is not high enough . 	0
PE	1273	What ' s more , not all the details of the artwork can be shown on the computer screen . 	0
PE	1274	For instance , you can ' t see the texture of the artwork which is very important to study the skills used by the artist . 	0
PE	1275	Seeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes . 	1
PE	1276	In conclusion , I believe we still need museums and art galleries but computers can be introduced to museums and galleries in order to help visitors to know more about the art works or historical objects . 	1
PE	1277	These may influence the comprehension of the art work or historical objects . 	0
PE	1278	Extraordinarily cautious is important since rough work is intolerable 	0
PE	1279	This current world we situate ourselves in is rather unpredictable , even one sudden invention could bring down all the notions we used bear in mind . 	0
PE	1280	Most of us has endeavored to keep up with the pace of the development of today ' s world in fast pace . 	0
PE	1281	I personally believe that even when fast pace may be the wise move to correspond with today ' s world . 	1
PE	1282	However , it might not be the most beneficial move to our society . 	1
PE	1283	Primarily , even when the world operates in fast pace , it still requires accuracy . 	1
PE	1284	Even simple issues in our daily life like homework require accuracy . 	0
PE	1285	If we rush through the work by taking risk of making mistakes , we are actually making zero effort going through our study roughly only for the purpose of fill in before the deadline . 	0
PE	1286	In short , it only fulfills the work itself which is rather worthless . 	0
PE	1287	It is our capability of work that we should improve rather than holding the belief in completing it . 	0
PE	1288	Unlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines , traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat , laugh and cooperate face to face . 	0
PE	1289	As a result , communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more . 	0
PE	1290	Furthermore , it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today . 	1
PE	1291	In fact , these traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children ' s skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices . 	0
PE	1292	By contrast , modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits . 	0
PE	1293	Therefore , there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents , such as violence or pornography , arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival . 	0
PE	1294	Thus , I would conclude that traditional games should be , by no means , ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games . 	1
PE	1295	Only through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process . 	1
PE	1296	For the reasons mentioned above , it seems to me that testing on animals has no clear result and consequently , it should be made illegal . 	1
PE	1297	Take the most popular and prestigious technology company - Apple - for example . 	0
PE	1298	Second , being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others . 	1
PE	1299	In other words , once you are special and unique , pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you . 	0
PE	1300	In conclusion , being different and unique is the better way to achieve success . 	1
PE	1301	It not only shows your competence but also creates your own value , making you take the lead in your way towards success . 	1
PE	1302	It has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers . 	0
PE	1303	In conclusion , there are many valuable factors about roommate that are important . 	0
PE	1304	Through communication , bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others . 	0
PE	1305	However , people might not get what they want all the time . 	0
PE	1306	Consideration and communication , in my personal opinion , are the most important quality . 	1
PE	1307	For the above reasons , if we have a chance to visit top museums in the world , we must stop by these museums . 	1
PE	1308	During our trip , it is worthwhile for us to visit a museum of a new place . 	1
PE	1309	Moreover , a local museum could be a top choice and destination for tourist to visit . 	1
PE	1310	Someone take a trip without making any plans , so they may waste their time on shopping or staying at their hotel . 	0
PE	1311	As a result , visiting a museum saves their precious time for making a decision . 	0
PE	1312	Most important of all , a local museum represent its own typical culture so that visitors may easily acquaint with the new place in a short time . 	0
PE	1313	Although sport is important , it does not have the same priority of library has . 	1
PE	1314	In addition only small part of students attend sport activities . 	0
PE	1315	First , I think a library is vital and strategical part of a university . 	0
PE	1316	All professors and students need to have a modern and well-equipped library because , after internet , library plays an important role in research . 	1
PE	1317	Most university rankings pay attention to quality of these two activities . 	0
PE	1318	In my opinion universities should invest in libraries more than anywhere else . 	1
PE	1319	Universities should give money to sport activities or libraries 	0
PE	1320	Libraries and sports activities play important roles in universities success . 	0
PE	1321	For example , in my university number of students who use the library is much more than students do sports activities . 	0
PE	1322	Second , usually libraries do not have income . 	0
PE	1323	The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose . 	1
PE	1324	At the increasing living pace , the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes . 	0
PE	1325	Whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need , especially for children who are growing up . 	0
PE	1326	Cooking is not a waste of time , contrarily , it is crucial for our health and culture . 	0
PE	1327	But rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits , which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking . 	0
PE	1328	In conclusion , although the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work , it is not a good thing . 	1
PE	1329	In conclusion , even though the people from older generation may claim they had better life as there were stronger bonds between family members and friends , I think they are wrong , since they judge the contemporary age through a personal prejudice . 	1
PE	1330	In light of the above-mentioned facts , one can easily conclude that in the current world living standards stand in a much higher level and people are in better conditions socially and physically . 	1
PE	1331	To be specific , scientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body , which is a miraculous breakthrough . 	0
PE	1332	In general , the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine . 	1
PE	1333	Today , even some disabled people with serious vertebral injuries can start doing physical activities like walking again thanks to the continuingly efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists . 	0
PE	1334	The advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives . 	0
PE	1335	These days , there are increasing numbers of young people from the countryside moving to cities in search of jobs and educational opportunities . 	0
PE	1336	Young people move to cities 	0
PE	1337	To begin with , the major cause that leads to urban migration of young adults is that cities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas . 	0
PE	1338	Personally , I think it has some drawbacks that will be discussed in this essay together with some reasons about this . 	0
PE	1339	However , this phenomenon sometimes poses several negative consequences . 	0
PE	1340	For example , if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work , he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time . 	0
PE	1341	As a result , cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation . 	1
PE	1342	There are several reasons why animal testing should be banned . 	1
PE	1343	Many medical treatments have been discovered by animal testing , including cancer and HIV drugs While most scientists claim that this is vital for improving human health , I believe that primates should have the same rights as human beings . 	1
PE	1344	Testing on animals and keeping them in unnatural conditions 	0
PE	1345	She learned quickly and understood everything in class so fast . 	0
PE	1346	Thus , she rarely went to class but spent most time to understand confusing topic . 	0
PE	1347	Student can also study by themselves in the library and focus on only the topic they do not understand . 	0
PE	1348	I think going to classes should be optional for students for the following reasons . 	1
PE	1349	Firstly , the reason why university students should not be required to attend class is sometimes the students in the university can learn better from other sources outside the class room . 	1
PE	1350	However , class is not the only source of knowledge . 	0
PE	1351	Students also learn from other sources such as experience , libraries and other people . 	0
PE	1352	Attending university classes should be required or optional 	0
PE	1353	On the other hand , children are shown how to behave well with others . 	0
PE	1354	This seems to be easy but this can influence positively their future children and makes children ' s behavior better before they face the real world . 	0
PE	1355	Thus , they tend to provide the best knowledge and advice from their experience for children . 	0
PE	1356	Unlike a professional , parents always support children and give them much social skill so they can communicate well with others and have good habit in life . 	0
PE	1357	I personally believe that human beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual . 	1
PE	1358	Many people agree that it is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals , but also misleading , since animals and people ' s response to a drug can be different . 	0
PE	1359	There is also the argument that many ethical and genetic principles are broken when testing on animals . 	0
PE	1360	Consequently , I think that sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity . 	1
PE	1361	In fact , parents ' support is one factor which makes people succeed in their life . 	1
PE	1362	I am biased towards the opposite side that businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life because of the three main crucial reasons . 	1
PE	1363	The invaluable experience of senior employees can pass down to the young apprentices who get used to new job , but regularly give out creative and novel ideas . 	0
PE	1364	What ' s more , the rapid development in every field nowadays requires precise updates and access to new knowledge . 	0
PE	1365	Attending university ' s classes is one of activities that students have to do . 	0
PE	1366	All in all , I agree that parents are the greatest teachers and I think that they should be very careful with what they say and do in front of their child , because it can define who he is going to be . 	1
PE	1367	So , if there is a man that beats his wife and treats her bad , his child probably is going to be rude and treat girls bad . 	0
PE	1368	Also , attending to classes makes students more attentive and have them to do their studies on time that this attitude lead them to success . 	1
PE	1369	However , the ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times . 	0
PE	1370	Through this way , they may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study . 	0
PE	1371	On the basis of the points mentioned above , I convinced that communicating and studying with peer group is a good way for learning materials . 	1
PE	1372	Moreover , teachers have a conspicuous role in assisting students for learning materials that being present at classes is a requisite for benefiting it . 	1
PE	1373	If you don ' t make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others , you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you . 	1
PE	1374	Take myself for example , when I was in college , I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report because I was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently . 	0
PE	1375	The number of individual who enroll in university are enormous , more than any school one person have studied . 	0
PE	1376	Thus , students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation , even from the whole world . 	1
PE	1377	For instance , my brother are studying in an international university with a mixed community include Vietnam , Brazil , Argentina , etc . And he told me that he is very excited for experiencing such new environment , which is one of his main purposes when attending university . 	0
PE	1378	Last but not least , preparing for career is an essential function of university . 	1
PE	1379	Students not only do homework , assignment and attend class but also need to participate in volunteer work , internship and part time job . 	0
PE	1380	Thus , they can have some experiences in the outside world and discover what their life goals are . 	0
PE	1381	After all , they know where and what to put high emphasis on in order to achieve their objectives . 	0
PE	1382	In summation , people may attend university for various reasons . 	0
PE	1383	Some want to enjoy new experiences , some are going to prepare for their future career , while others are eager to develop their understanding . 	0
PE	1384	Even though the purposes could be various , everybody who is studying in university should concentrate on the objectives and try their best . 	1
PE	1385	Only who has the sharpest weapon can survive . 	0
PE	1386	As far as I am concerned , I strongly believe that online classes should never replace classroom learning . 	1
PE	1387	I list my reasons as follows . 	0
PE	1388	Classroom learnng vs online education 	0
PE	1389	There are some people who believe that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning while there are some people who strongly disagree with this opinion . 	0
PE	1390	For example , When I was in First Year in B Com , I was not serious in my study , but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me , it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects . 	0
PE	1391	Finally I got 1st rank in final exam . 	0
PE	1392	First , indeed classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes . 	1
PE	1393	In the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates , because if you see any of your classmates who is performing better , it will force you for making your performance more better . 	0
PE	1394	And it has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation . 	1
PE	1395	Indeed , they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas . 	0
PE	1396	This means some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market . 	0
PE	1397	In conclusion , financial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries . 	1
PE	1398	Therefore , developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries . 	1
PE	1399	In my opinion though , social networks such as Facebook could foster the ties between friends and family members who are obligatorily far away from each other by keeping them in touch , the thing that was impossible less than 20 years ago . 	0
PE	1400	The phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human being to make the world a healthier and , thus , a happier place to live in . 	0
PE	1401	A clear-cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones . 	0
PE	1402	The strong navigation system installed on the phones has been rescued lives of many who left alone in remote areas like forests or deserts . 	0
PE	1403	Do you believe that elderly people used to live in a better world ? 	0
PE	1404	Changes are inseparable parts of this world which normally humans are responsible for by manipulating the environment they live in . 	0
PE	1405	Sometimes these changes adversely affect our lives that make elderly people think they used to live in a better world than the modern world the younger generation are experiencing . 	0
PE	1406	I utterly disagree with this opinion due to technological and medical reasons . 	0
PE	1407	However , according to my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence . 	0
PE	1408	Try something new can indeed make people become special , while it does not mean successful . 	0
PE	1409	The same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm . 	0
PE	1410	In contrast , those athletes try to have distinctive performance by taking risks of taking drugs are failed to succeed . 	0
PE	1411	Hence , from this case , we are capable of stating that it is not necessary for successful people to take risks . 	1
PE	1412	Admittedly , on the other hands , there might be some dissidents proclaiming that doing something new is necessary for people to success because they can become different from others , which is also a widely accepted idea for success . 	1
PE	1413	Therefore , we can commence to agree that successful people do not have to try new things or take risks . 	1
PE	1414	Moreover , another equally crucial aspect is that it depends on the capability of one to decide whether he can succeed or not . 	0
PE	1415	At least , a successful person should be able to dismantle the hurdles prohibiting him to success . 	0
PE	1416	For instance , the sports stars do not have to take some drugs to win a game or show their extraordinary skills . 	0
PE	1417	This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable . 	0
PE	1418	I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages . 	0
PE	1419	As far as my opinion is concerned , I find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power . 	1
PE	1420	The topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate with proponents maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy while opponents argue that atomic technology is uncontrollable and very dangerous to handle . 	0
PE	1421	The nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy 	0
PE	1422	Another reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity . 	1
PE	1423	If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage . 	0
PE	1424	Last century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons . 	0
PE	1425	First and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons . 	1
PE	1426	Firstly , the costs outweigh the benefits . 	0
PE	1427	For example , everyone around me speaks foreign language , and then I have to improve myself to communicate with people . 	0
PE	1428	Knowing foreign language is became more and more important in this time . 	0
PE	1429	Learning a foreign language in my own country or another country 	0
PE	1430	There are two options to learn foreign language . 	0
PE	1431	Many people pursue to study foreign language . 	0
PE	1432	The second option is that go to study in another place that foreign language are spoken . 	0
PE	1433	First is stay in homeland to study foreign language . 	0
PE	1434	I will give reasons to support my opinion . 	0
PE	1435	Going to another place to learn language is better choice . 	1
PE	1436	As a result , I spent the time of biology class to do my Chemistry research and got A + for both biology and chemistry . 	0
PE	1437	In conclusion , I think the students should know what activities they should do at the time and have good management for their learning time . 	1
PE	1438	Also , they have to know how to deal with the effects from not attending classes . 	0
PE	1439	So that , attending classes in the university will not be required to the students anymore . 	1
PE	1440	Finally , she got very good grade when she was graduation . 	0
PE	1441	Secondly , students should not be required to attend classes because they can manage the time spending on classes to do other benefit things if they already understand topic in the class very well . 	1
PE	1442	In my experience , many times I did not attend biology class because my university does not require the students to attend classes . 	0
PE	1443	Also , I had already studied all biology topics before attending university . 	0
PE	1444	In my city , National Palace Museum is celebrated for collection of ancient Chinese artifacts . 	0
PE	1445	To my astonishment , Jadeite cabbage is the most famous artistic work , which is made of jade , is vividly shown . 	0
PE	1446	Secondary , visiting a well-known museum also can broaden our horizon . 	1
PE	1447	Those outstanding and diverse range of objects , with classic and magnificent art , is guaranteed to inspire us ! 	0
PE	1448	Through the exhibit , I found that the Statue of Liberty symbolized freedom , and Ellis Island may be the place , where the immigration took their dreams and fears . 	0
PE	1449	Thus , museums can help us know the history and the customs of a new place . 	1
PE	1450	Primary , it is easy to know the history of the new place . 	0
PE	1451	Last year , I went to Ellis Island and the immigration museum , where is a symbol of American immigration and the immigrant experience in the New York . 	0
PE	1452	Why people visit museums ? 	0
PE	1453	As a lover of travel , a quintessence of any visit to an excellent museum of a new place would be the best part of a tour , which can be explained by the following reasons . 	1
PE	1454	Meanwhile , children ' s access to the celebrities news on the media should be restricted and they should study only from the celebrities who can act positively . 	0
PE	1455	In conclusion , media should shift its focus from covering celebrities to elsewhere . 	1
PE	1456	This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material . 	0
PE	1457	Further more , they will not value other people ' s hard work and take everything for granted . 	0
PE	1458	This gives children the idea that it is not necessary to study hard at school for a better career and earning a living . 	1
PE	1459	It is not uncommon to see on the media that some of them are committing to crimes or misbehaving such as being addicted to drugs or alcohols , having messy sex lives . 	0
PE	1460	Meanwhile , not all celebrities are role models . 	0
PE	1461	Celebrities , for example movie stars , are usually seen on media living a luxury life or having a new girlfriend , etc . It is human nature that people , especially youngsters , are attracted to the celebrities they favour , and that is why the media prefer to cover as much news of the celebrities as possible . 	0
PE	1462	Drugs , alcohol and messy sex lives 	0
PE	1463	The first impression of the celebrities seems that they are rich while not having to work hard . 	0
PE	1464	But I tend to think that this is a worrying tread which has negative impact on children . 	1
PE	1465	Of course , some celebrities , e . g . writers , passionate entrepreneurs are good examples to children for they share fascinating stories or how to pursue their goal by doing something that has a meaning to them and may change the world . 	1
PE	1466	Worse still , without proper parenting , children may perceive that this is the cool life people are supposed to be living . 	1
PE	1467	Moreover you can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others . 	0
PE	1468	It makes you communication and of course your group skills better , which can help you in your future and career . 	0
PE	1469	Third , professors play vital role in classroom learning , most of them are specialists is their subjects , and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills . 	0
PE	1470	You can improve your skills by work under any professor ; you can ask questions face to face , it will clear your doubts . 	0
PE	1471	In result you learn quickly . 	1
PE	1472	For example , I have my personal experience . 	0
PE	1473	For Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses , but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT , and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster . 	0
PE	1474	It ' s undeniable that online classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary , but they could not be substitute of existing classroom learning . 	1
PE	1475	From the discussed above , we can easily draw the conclusion that the classroom learning is the best way to provide education for these reasons . 	1
PE	1476	New challenges from different tasks amounts far more than more works , it also means through dealing with it , I will obtain more knowledge and experience . 	0
PE	1477	As the saying of a Chinese writer , the color of life is rooted not in Japanese cherry blossom or Canadian maple leaf , but rather there always exists new things and challenge . 	0
PE	1478	After all , doing same task day and night just server to increase our psychological burden , connecting with different types of job is capable give us more colors to our life . 	1
PE	1479	To sum up , I admire my father ' s choice , while the same task give us opportunities to be an expert , like my mom , I still hold the firm view that different types of tasks endow more colors to our life . 	1
PE	1480	Having children in the daily exercise routine from an early age will teach them the important value of having physical activity in their every day routine . 	1
PE	1481	Daily exercise will provide children with a mental break which will boost them to be efficient learners . 	0
PE	1482	Moreover , they can stick with the routine and make the daily physical activities a good habit on their whole life . 	0
PE	1483	Children are bombarded with lectures about nutrition and physical activity ; however , they will be more beneficed if that knowledge can be put in practice . 	0
PE	1484	It will meliorate not only mental and body health , but also will establish in children a habit of doing it , giving them the opportunity to measure the worth of including such an important activity in their daily live schedules . 	1
PE	1485	Including physical activity in children ' s school day should be strongly considered . 	1
PE	1486	Instead of spend time with family and friends , they like to seat on a chair for hours . 	0
PE	1487	Learning foreign language form another country is better choice for me to study language . 	1
PE	1488	Besides , in foreign country I could have a chance to speak foreign language with my friends . 	1
PE	1489	Thus , I could talk with my friend without worrying about speaking wrong . 	0
PE	1490	The only language that I could talk to make friends is English language . 	0
PE	1491	In conclusion , I personally believe that learning language from foreign country is better than learning language in home country because I have to improve myself to communicate with other people . 	1
PE	1492	This reason makes me have a progress in foreign language faster . 	0
PE	1493	This environment makes me want to develop myself to be able to communicate with people that speak foreign language . 	0
PE	1494	If I could not communicate with other people , I could not even buy food to sacrifice my hunger . 	0
PE	1495	For instance , English school in outside my home country , there are many people that come from different places and from different languages . 	0
PE	1496	Secondly , having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster . 	1
PE	1497	Different people attend university for different point of views . 	0
PE	1498	In my perspective , the three most reasons are increased knowledge , career preparation and new experiences . 	1
PE	1499	Concentrate on the objectives - people attend schools for various reasons 	0
PE	1500	From many centuries ago , universities have been playing an important role in ones ' life . 	0
PE	1501	Thus , people are able to strengthen their knowledge . 	0
PE	1502	Moreover , through the instructions of teachers , the sufficient infrastructure such as laboratory , library , students is capable of doing research on every academic aspect . 	0
PE	1503	First of all , for most people , university is an ideal place for them to develop their understanding . 	0
PE	1504	Truthfully , in this wonderful academic environment , everyone is provided with varieties and gigantic number of information by a lot of professors and well-trained teachers . 	0
PE	1505	Therefore , they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying . 	1
PE	1506	Secondly , studying in university means that you have totally turned into a different page of your life , which included many new experiences . 	0
PE	1507	Testing is a very important aspect of life , and still the majority of tests do not allow you to work in team . 	0
PE	1508	What is more , there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people . 	1
PE	1509	Therefore , it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people , who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively . 	1
PE	1510	In conclusion , university restriction has both pros and cons . 	1
PE	1511	Apart from the disheartened ones , many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs , mostly the white-collar ones . 	0
PE	1512	That ' s why it should be made available for a wide range of learners . 	1
PE	1513	In my opinion , it will yield more negative results than positive ones . 	0
PE	1514	They are critical part of universities and a good university has to have a modern library . 	1
PE	1515	In spite of the importance of sports activities , libraries are more important . 	1
PE	1516	Second , in classroom learning you have to complete study work on time . 	0
PE	1517	It makes you perfect in time management skills . 	1
PE	1518	Pupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click , such as science reports , study posts , documentary records , etc . A student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule so he can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course . 	0
PE	1519	It is undeniable that traditional education has its advantages in face-to-face communication , mental inspiration and physical educations . 	1
PE	1520	Distance-learning cannot bring the benefits that traditional colleges offer 	0
PE	1521	With the tremendous development in information technology , long-distance education enables people to study at home without going to school . 	0
PE	1522	Whether this teaching approach is more beneficial to pupils than the traditional way sparks off a heated debate . 	0
PE	1523	From my perspective , I agree with the view that students can acquire more benefits from the remote education . 	1
PE	1524	To begin with , studying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense . 	1
PE	1525	Students who use distance-learning programs can cut down their commuting time , tuition fees , textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection . 	0
PE	1526	This especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far-off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty-line . 	0
PE	1527	Besides that , long-distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches . 	1
PE	1528	However , if you aren ' t extremely dedicated or have good time management skills , it may be very difficult to complete a course at home . 	0
PE	1529	You can study any time you want . 	0
PE	1530	In addition , you could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course . 	0
PE	1531	The biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day . 	0
PE	1532	Studying at home by using technology is convenient . 	1
PE	1533	Here are my reasons . 	0
PE	1534	I don ' t think that technology can replace teachers and classroom . 	1
PE	1535	Study at home by using technology / study or traditional school 	0
PE	1536	Especially when you don ' t have an instructor there to guide you , it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements . 	0
PE	1537	First , attending an education course at home requires persistence and patience . 	0
PE	1538	Sometimes , face-to face communication can lead us to convince or complain someone successfully , and a fitting example can be found from my uncle . 	0
PE	1539	We live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light , steering the world toward a much more convenient place . 	1
PE	1540	The fact of doing things by ourselves can help us to get some experiences that would strong our maturity . 	0
PE	1541	For example if some one wants to learn how to be a leader , they have to experience this by being in a real situation of leading a team or a group , or even a situation . 	0
PE	1542	There are a lot of reasons to recommend this method for who is serious about learning some thing in their lives . 	0
PE	1543	First of all , learning by doing things develops our maturity . 	1
PE	1544	When you do things by your self , you learn to depend on yourself . 	0
PE	1545	You will not be in need to refer to books or persons . 	0
PE	1546	People learn in different ways and what teaching method do you prefer ? 	0
PE	1547	They use several ways to broaden their knowledge and their skills . 	0
PE	1548	One of these several ways of learning that I prefer is doing things by my self rather than learning by reading about things or learning by listening to people talking about . 	1
PE	1549	Moreover , some people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face-to-face communication . 	0
PE	1550	Admittedly , on the other hand , there might be some dissidents proclaiming that communication by letters , email , or telephone can enable them to talk without scruple , which is also one of the most important parts in communication . 	1
PE	1551	However , from my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying . 	0
PE	1552	Apart from the one I have mentioned above , another equally crucible aspect is that it is easy to be deceived without face-to face communication . 	0
PE	1553	For instance , I had received some harmful words on facebook from my best friend , Eric . 	0
PE	1554	If he just wrote something to complain on the website or by telephone , I do not think this problem would be thought important . 	0
PE	1555	Therefore , we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way . 	1
PE	1556	Finally , I realized that his facebook account was stolen . 	0
PE	1557	Hence , from this case , we are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face-to-face . 	1
PE	1558	He said that I was totally failed in building a good friendship and he did not want to be one of my friends anymore . 	0
PE	1559	I just shocked and did not know what happened . 	0
PE	1560	Learning by doing things gives us more and more pleasure especially if we success in learning perfectly this things . 	0
PE	1561	So we become motivated to learn other things by doing them . 	1
PE	1562	Another reason that makes learning by doing things more advantageous than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about is that we find more motivation to continuing on learning by doing things . 	0
PE	1563	With the time , Reading about things or listening to people talking about could become more and more boring . 	0
PE	1564	People who want to learn how to swim have to go to the beach or to the swimpool and laid themselves in the water to feel and know what is swimming . 	0
PE	1565	Nor listening to people or reading about can teach them swimming . 	0
PE	1566	There are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them . 	0
PE	1567	Reading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing . 	0
PE	1568	We can not be leaders by reading books or by listening to person talking about leading . 	0
PE	1569	Secondly , learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about . 	1
PE	1570	In addition , the authorities should adequately support these sustainable developments . 	0
PE	1571	To conclude , as far as I am concerned , international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries . 	1
PE	1572	Thus , tourism has survived many non-tangible cultural values and beauty scenes . 	1
PE	1573	In conclusion , I concede that traditional education has some merits like feedbacks and inspirations that cannot be replaced in the near future . 	1
PE	1574	However , distance-learning outweighs the conventional way not only with its efficiency , convenience and economic value , but also with the self-regulated education that pupils can study on their own purpose . 	1
PE	1575	These make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils ' personalities . 	0
PE	1576	But with the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies , remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts . 	0
PE	1577	To sum it up , from above mentioned facts it can easily be deduced that nuclear power may appear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages . 	1
PE	1578	Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it . 	1
PE	1579	Last but not least , while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power . 	0
PE	1580	Thus I suggest that use of nuclear technology should be discouraged even for civil purposes . 	0
PE	1581	They have more opportunities , profits , and authorities . 	1
PE	1582	There is no doubt that working for the other have some advantages , too , but I imagine people that have their own business are more comfortable . 	1
PE	1583	For all of them we have to ask for a permission , and most of the time we are not allowed . 	0
PE	1584	Sometimes some occasions happen to people for example a disease , sticking in a traffic jam and sometime going on a vacation . 	0
PE	1585	When you work for yourself you can punch in and punch out whenever you want . 	0
PE	1586	Finally , there are some authorities in privat jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others . 	1
PE	1587	Furthermore , the factories and companies will have abundant human sources to ensure the pace of manufacture and also devising lots of unique ideas . 	0
PE	1588	In a nutshell , varied characteristics of various people , feeling tired of having the same occupation and solving the unemployed problem drive me to agree with the statement that the employer should not hire the staff for a whole life . 	1
PE	1589	Thereafter , the bulk of them realize that high promotion and competition can assist them to improve their skills and horizons also . 	0
PE	1590	Many people enjoy challenging them because they don not want to be monotonous and passive ones . 	0
PE	1591	Secondly , the staff soon gets boring with their stable job in such a long time . 	1
PE	1592	At a certain time , they may presume that a securing job is the most important and necessary because they need to earn money to manage their life . 	0
PE	1593	In my opinion , the businesses ought to recruit many workers so as to tackle this aching issue . 	1
PE	1594	It enables the jobless to better their life and earn a living . 	0
PE	1595	The same-old-same-old environment soon makes them depressed , so this situation will have an adverse impact on the enterprise . 	0
PE	1596	Last but not least , the economic crisis and financial recession result in a tremendous increase in unemployment . 	0
PE	1597	For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area . 	0
PE	1598	In addition , cooking is one of arts humans create . 	0
PE	1599	The reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors . 	0
PE	1600	It is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value . 	0
PE	1601	Moreover , communication is as well making a good roommate . 	0
PE	1602	It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member . 	0
PE	1603	One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project . 	0
PE	1604	People have different habit in daily life , such as tidy the blanket in the morning . 	0
PE	1605	Therefore , communication is very important as it would clear up the misinterpretation . 	1
PE	1606	If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk . 	0
PE	1607	The sky is the limit ; there are all kinds of personality out there . 	0
PE	1608	We need to be flexible to be account into society . 	0
PE	1609	However , I think traditional games are still indispensible in children ' s learning process , even much more essential than modern games , especially in modern society . 	1
PE	1610	One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children ' s communication skills . 	0
PE	1611	With technological advances , children have more access to modern games currently . 	0
PE	1612	In such case , the relative importance of traditional games and modern games in children ' s developments of skills has become a frequent topic of discussion . 	0
PE	1613	Traditional games or modern games in developing children ' s skills 	0
PE	1614	Games have played a key role in children ' s growth , especially in terms of their abilities . 	0
PE	1615	This is because children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games , which , in fact , helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future . 	0
PE	1616	At the same time , children have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology , raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative . 	0
PE	1617	For me , I believe parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games . 	1
PE	1618	It is true that modern games may be , to some extent , beneficial for children to foster some skills , such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend . 	1
PE	1619	All in all , protecting endangered animals is necessary , nevertheless , human needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important . 	1
PE	1620	For instant , we can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct . 	0
PE	1621	With the economy development , we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals . 	0
PE	1622	According to the discuss above , agriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy . 	0
PE	1623	Last I want to mention is that even though farmland , housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals , it can do good to protect the endangered animals . 	1
PE	1624	In addition , highly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life . 	0
PE	1625	Especially in some poor areas , survival is the most significant thing . 	0
PE	1626	It is clearly understood that farming , housing and industry provide us the food we eat , place we live , clothes we wear , which are essential to live . 	0
PE	1627	Second , farmland , housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life . 	1
PE	1628	Let ' s imagine that you perform really well when you can discuss the problems with other people , but you have no experience of working alone , standardized tests such as SAT , TOEFL may be your nightmares . 	0
PE	1629	The apperant example is that there are a lot of tests that do not allow team-working . 	0
PE	1630	Working in team is a necessary skill that every individual must master for success . 	0
PE	1631	Despite the importance of working in team , I still believe that the capability of working independly is more significant . 	1
PE	1632	Work in team or independently 	0
PE	1633	Nowadays , as the world is getting smaller , we need to be able to cooperate . 	0
PE	1634	In such circumstances , even when the scientists want to finish off quickly , but they couldn ' t miss even a single part of the mission since it may trigger loads of problems . 	0
PE	1635	To sum up , even when we need to catch up with the pace of the world , it is necessary for us to be extraordinarily cautious since rough work is intolerable when we want to stay competitive . 	1
PE	1636	Even when we managed to keep up with the pace by neglecting the details of a project and only aim for a general frame of the project , this will not be something satisfy for the company and clients . 	1
PE	1637	We soon will be out of the picture even when we kept up with the pace since when the problem reveals itself we ' ll have to go back and fix the mistakes we have made . 	0
PE	1638	Certainly it may take time to keep up with the others if w need to review our work multiple times , but with consistent work soon enough we ' ll be able to bring up our speed in completion of work . 	0
PE	1639	Secondly , other than the importance of accuracy , the world also seeks efficiency , which concludes both minimum time completion and also criterion of quality . 	0
PE	1640	Some work cannot tolerate any mistakes at all , for instance , in official missions like the work done by NASA , a tiny mistake can be catastrophic . 	1
PE	1641	A miscalculation of the orbit in launching rocket may lead to a failure of the whole project which might worth trillions of dollars . 	0
PE	1642	This might be even more costly and time consuming than a neat completion of work at the start . 	0
PE	1643	Besides , when looking at this problem within a broader image . 	0
PE	1644	Therefore , if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college , acing your school ' s final tests , you should consider learning to work on your own . 	1

VG	1815	It is crucial that this specialized form of bankruptcy relief for family farmers not be allowed to sunset for two fundamental reasons . 	1
VG	1816	First , family farmers , absent chapter 12 , would be forced to file for bankruptcy relief under the Bankruptcy Code ' s other al-ternatives , none of which work as well for them as does chapter 12 . 	0
VG	1817	Chapter VII of the Bankruptcy Code , for instance , would require a farmer to liquidate ; that is , sell the family farm to pay the claims of the farmer ' s credi-tors . 	0
VG	1818	Many farmers would be precluded from choosing bankruptcy relief under chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code be-cause of its restrictive eligibility standards . 	0
VG	1819	Furthermore , Chapter XI , the Bankruptcy Code ' s business reorga-nization alternative , is not farmer-friendly in various respects , as it often entails an expensive and time-con-suming process that does not readily accommodate the special needs of farmers . 	0
VG	1820	Second , recent statistics dem-onstrate that there is not only a con-tinuing need for chapter 12 , but that this need is apparently increasing . 	0
VG	1821	Ac-cording to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts , chapter 12 bankruptcy filings jumped by more than 62 percent over the past year . 	0
VG	1822	I in-troduced H . R . 2465 to extend chapter 12 for an additional 6 months through De-cember 31 , 2003 , and thereby maintain the status quo while the Congress com-pletes its consideration of comprehen-sive bankruptcy reform . 	0

VG	1860	First , it is the practice of parliamentary draftsmen to show an abundance of caution and to favour the avoidance of doubt . 	0
VG	1861	In considering the intention of Parliament when passing the 1985 Act , or perhaps more properly the intention of the draftsman in settling its terms , there are three ( but only three ) hypotheses to be considered : ( 1 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because it was regarded as clear that the 1938 Act would continue to operate , in cases to which it applied , irrespective of the terms of Part V ; ( 2 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because it was not in the mind of the draftsman of Part V ; ( 3 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because Part V was not seen to encroach upon or conflict with the operation of section 5 . 	1

VG	1863	The Prime Minister has described global warming as the most serious environmental threat to the planet , and we know that a major accelerator is the emission of carbon dioxide and other carbon gases . 	0
VG	1864	British Energy has pointed out that the generation of about 64 TWh or 64 , 000 GWh by its nuclear power stations avoids the production and generation of about 40 million tonnes of carbon dioxide . 	0
VG	1865	Secondly , had the draftsman conceived that a secure tenant ' s right to buy could be subject to a condition of ministerial consent under section 5 that right would not have been defined in section 118 in the terms quoted in paragraph 7 above , and provision would have been made for asserting and admitting or denying , and handling , claims to exercise the right to buy where ministerial consent was required . 	0
VG	1866	If I concluded ( as I do not ) that section 5 was intended to operate in cases covered by Part V , I would agree with Buxton LJ that the Part V procedures could be made to work , but the absence of any indication that the procedures were devised to apply to conditional rights fortifies the inference that section 5 was not intended to operate in cases covered by Part V . Had it been so intended , the draftsman would have imposed a duty on a local authority to refer to the Secretary of State a claim to exercise the right to buy made by a tenant whose case fell within section 5 . 	0

VG	1888	Study Reports on the International Situation-1997-1998 , a yearly compilation of the views of authors from a variety of institutes published by the Chinese Society for Strategy and Management , contained an article that argues why Russia and China are very natural strategic partners . 	1
VG	1889	The author , Zheng Yu , writes , " Even if the next Russian President takes office with pro-Western influence in the year 2000 , Russia ' s unique diplomatic and cultural tradition , its consciousness as a great power , and the natural characteristics formed by the Orthodox Eastern Church will make it difficult " for Russia to be part of the West . 	0
VG	1890	The process of catching up for Russia has lasted " several hundred years , since Peter the Great , [ and ] has not made Russia entirely Westernized . " 	0

VG	1906	On the basis of my experience of Christ as a living reality today , I know he ' s risen from the dead . 	0
VG	1907	And that would be true , even if I lived , say , in Kyrgyzstan , where I never had the opportunity to look at the historical evidence for the resurrection of Jesus , and I never had a New Testament , and I only heard a missionary broadcast on a short-wave radio . 	0

WD	1942	The survival of excellent girls ' and boys ' schools in just about every large community I can think of strikes me as testimony not to the enduring idea of separation of the sexes but rather to some very sophisticated evolving ideas of what it means to be a young woman or man . 	0

WD	2084	Boys are also able to focus better during their puberity stages without the distraction of girls and the urges their hormones tend to trigger . 	0
WD	2085	I wish I had moved sooner , but if I could have afforded private school my son would have gone . 	0
WD	2086	I even could read music and knew my multiplication tables and could add and subtract 3-digit numbers ( not to brag , but you know what I mean ) . 	0
WD	2087	However , I was behind socially ; I couldn ’ t stand up for myself without swearing ( actually using the f-word and such ) , I refused to ask for help , so I was redshirted . 	0
WD	2088	Intentionally and explicitly working to turn out strong , capable , assertive women , Ellis--its heritage , its excellent teachers , and its visionary leadership--is all about helping girls find and build on their strengths and passions . 	0

WD	2100	This was promising to see . 	0
WD	2101	Another promising skill I saw was when he was stuck on a word , he remembered he wrote it previously and therefore looked back at the word to help him spell it again . 	0
WD	2102	He wanted all the action to start at the beginning and with all his ideas the characters were being sent in every direction possible . 	0
WD	2103	However , he had no idea how to start the beginning of his narrative and what the structure of a narrative is , with the orientation beginning the narrative and the complication following . 	0
WD	2104	This is quite interesting as it demonstrates that he is still at that level of a kindergarten / yr 1 student , being able to verbally produce a sentence however , not write it down exactly . 	0
WD	2105	From this , even though his structuring was slightly off track he was able to verbally produce some great sentences however , forgot them for when he had to write them down . 	0

WD	2107	As previously mentioned in my last blog ( Weekly reflection 2 ) I was working individually with a child with significant learning difficulties . 	0
WD	2108	What I did notice whilst I was working with him was that at first he had absolutely no idea of what to write and me not knowing the movie did not help either but once I asked him to retell me what happened in the movie and started giving him some ideas he thought of his own and from there had some great ideas . 	0

WD	2116	My son went to Columbus Public Schools , in Columbus , Ohio and they treated him and myself badly . 	0

WD	2118	It made no difference . 	0
WD	2119	They didn ' t want my help or my commitment to the school . 	0
WD	2120	I moved to the suburbs and the education in our suburban public schools are good the teachers were better and they appreciated my involvement . 	0

WD	2124	In 2013 , the world is decidedly different , and the battles are far less obscure . 	0
WD	2125	Colleges wrestle explicitly with how to combat " rape culture , " and events like the Steubenville trial generate national conversations around how our society fosters gender-role development . 	0
WD	2126	I had never really thought what it might be like to work in an all-female environment , stuck firmly at the bottom of a ladder , and so my summers there were a revelation . 	0
WD	2127	Not the least part of the revelation involved my discovery that the young leaders of the camp , members of the first generation of late-20th-century feminists , were pretty serious about using the camp experience--sailing , biking , swimming , and lots of group activities--as leadership development . 	0
WD	2128	I also learned the hard way not to step into problem-solving roles until I was asked to , and I saw that younger campers idolized the competence of their counselors as much as they loved their warmth and enthusiasm . 	0
WD	2129	The task of female role models and mentors was changing , and the staff was up to the work . 	0
WD	2130	I also discovered what " collaborative leadership " meant , as the administrative staff--led by a superb director not long out of college herself--talked things over and made decisions in ways that sounded way more like what Chris Argyris had been talking about in his myth-shattering Organizational Behavior course that year than the autocratic , just-follow-me style I had imbibed from television , movies , and high school . 	0
WD	2131	If summers found me in a land of strong and independent women , my first three teaching jobs ( my fourth has been in a decidedly coed environment ) were back in a man ' s world . 	0
WD	2132	I think many of my generation of male teachers , with varying experiences navigating the waters of what the news magazines assured us was a Feminist Revolution , had been chastened more than a little on the meaning of masculinity and manhood , and so we did our best to tame our little corners of school environments that occasionally evoked Lord of the Flies ; gently mocked as Sensitive New Age Guys , we tried to help our male students exchange bluster and boisterousness for an occasional listen and maybe even the occasional tear . 	0
WD	2133	I don ' t know how well it worked , but we felt we were doing our small part to win obscure battles in the most remote fields of that revolution . 	0
WD	2134	I wouldn ' t send my dog to public schools in Florida . 	1

WD	2138	If you fail to get your kids educated in our SHARED knowledge base to a high school level , you are guilty of child abuse . 	0
WD	2139	I am sorry , I am a hardliner on this . 	0
WD	2140	All schools should be accredited by at least the state level government and you should not be legally allowed to drop out until you are 16 years old . 	0
WD	2141	You are assigning your kids to a life of poverty , opening them up to abuse and cutting them off from their potential . 	0
WD	2142	I went there in 2009 with my highschool in a cricket tour . . . i went to rondebosch , sacs / sax ( forgot ) , wynberg and another school that i cant remember model c or private school is your best bet ! 	1
WD	2143	make sure however , you send your kid to extra tuitions after school for problem subjects because i can safely say that when i was in school , sports was more important rather than academics . . . everyone wants to be 1st team in cricket , soccer and rugby 	0
WD	2144	If the child has support throughout all of his schooling life , I see why not . 	1
WD	2145	So the question is … should a child who has such significant learning difficulties be in a mainstream classroom ? 	1
WD	2146	I do believe that all students have the right to a good education and although this child is at a low academic level , he still participates in class when prompted and the other students in the class still communicate and play with him even though he is significantly behind academically . 	0
WD	2147	He has no behaviour problems and no physical demands that will affect other students in the classroom . 	0
WD	2148	He still has one on one time with the special education teacher and is receiving great help from his class teacher now and from his peers . 	0
WD	2149	If this child was to be in a special school / support unit the social skills he has now would be diminished and he may be at an even lower level than he is now as there are more interruptions than in a mainstream class . 	0
WD	2150	When I taught in NYC before NCLB , students were leveled off to their level and abilities so children can advance and not be waiting for others to catch up and learn English even . 	0
WD	2151	For a critical mass families and kids , some period of single-sex education is part of a path toward an adulthood informed in positive ways by an understanding of both the differences between the sexes and the ways in which we are all bound by our shared and very human anxieties , aspirations , and capacities . 	0

WD	2155	That ' s unheard of in public schools . 	0
WD	2156	We have a local private High school who turns out bright talented young people . 	0
WD	2157	No amount of parent involvement is going to solve those problems . 	0
WD	2158	With a plethora of drugs and gang problems , public schools are the LAST place I would send my child ! 	1
WD	2159	I would not having a problem sending mine to public if they were learning . 	0
WD	2160	We have a few thousand years of evidence for how poorly men treat women when women are excluded from male institutions . 	0
WD	2161	Actually he ' s much bigger than most kids so it seems unlikely . 	0
WD	2162	They get a better education and they are safer from acts of violence . 	0
WD	2163	Public schools have become more interested in political correctness than in education and there is too little control over violence . 	0
WD	2164	Boys tend to play and act up less when girls are not around , and they ' re less inclined to show off and seek attention . 	0
WD	2165	Girls on the other hand do not benfit as much from same sex schools as boys . 	0
WD	2166	Girls tend to achieve as well in both mixed and same sex environments . 	0
WD	2167	Not a problem . 	0
WD	2168	I can also speak from my experiences as qualified teacher and child psyc . 	0
WD	2169	Same sex education works best for males . 	0
WD	2170	Boys tend to obtain better grades and have less disciplinary issues in same sex schools . 	0
WD	2171	That said all the above are generalisations and atypical results , doesn ' t mean they apply or are relavent to your daughter . 	0
WD	2172	My personal opinion : If your daughter is on the fence about it , i personally would go for the co ed school assuming its facilities , teachers , and resources are equal to that of the same sex . 	1
WD	2173	Education is far too important to let the government do it . 	0
WD	2174	It is wrong to send a child to government schools . 	1

WD	2181	no difference in home schooling . 	0
WD	2182	you had to research it before you decided that would be your major ? 	0
WD	2183	you say you have to spend your own money for supplies . 	0
WD	2184	well , excuse me , but you did know that before you decided to become a teacher . 	0
WD	2185	you had to intern somewhere ? 	0
WD	2186	It ' s a crappy situation , and god help any social worker who haves to work that one case , because they ' re not even walking a thin line anymore , they ' re trying to dance between the clouds of child protection and respect of parental care . 	0
WD	2187	So many abuse cases show few warning signs while they occur ( the ones we hear about in the press tend to be more gory or shocking than the majority ) , and sadly even if a child is watched by social carers for 23 hours and 59 minutes a day , a determined abuser will wait till the last minute . 	0
WD	2188	And while of course the vast majority of people who home educate won ' t be using it as an excuse to hide the abuse of their children , there will be someone somewhere who does , and if and when that occurs the media frenzy and search for blame will occur . 	0
WD	2189	However . . . 	0
WD	2190	Removal of a child from established programs and situations ( such as state education ) will always raise a question mark in these times . 	0

WD	2193	Even the best public schools cannot reach every student all of the time . 	0
WD	2194	Additionally , American families hold a plethora of educational positions and beliefs that might move them to choose a private school . 	0
WD	2195	she is obviously a liberal . 	0
WD	2196	only a liberal buys into the if you make more money you have to give to the poor mindset . 	0
WD	2197	what she fails to recognize is , the more money you have , the more you give to charity . 	0
WD	2198	you donate your time , you give away clothing / shoes / coats to the needy , you assist with fundraisers to raise money for the poor whether it be for school supplies , food banks , etc . 	0
WD	2199	people with money give more . 	0
WD	2200	simple as that . 	0
WD	2201	you don ' t need to take additional tax dollars to prove that . 	0
WD	2202	i live in an area ( Georgia ) where there is no way in h*ll i would send my kid to a public school here . 	1
WD	2203	it is not safe , the teachers are cheating and it is riddled with gang activity . 	0
WD	2204	sending a child whose parents have money to a private school doesn ' t mean they are bad parents , it simply means they want more for their child . 	0
WD	2205	Of course , turning up late for a doctors appointment for your child will also raise a question mark , but generally these things mean nothing in isolation ( an A&E visit with a child will gain a mark , but you ' ll need a fair few before anyone pays any attention to it ) . 	0

WD	2224	Early advocates of coeducation like Bronson Alcott were thought to be batty . 	0
WD	2225	While the debate goes on about the legitimacy of single-sex classes and schools in the public sector , private and independent schools keep taking the concept to whole new levels . 	0
WD	2226	Once upon a time coeducation was unthinkable . 	0
WD	2227	As a kid I experienced both single-sex and coeducational schools . 	0
WD	2228	My public elementary school was coed , of course , and then I had six years of boys-only junior and senior high school . 	0
WD	2229	Plenty of progressive educators and theorists have since laid to rest most of the traditional concerns and fears of coeducation skeptics . 	0
WD	2230	Public schools have been coed for a long time , and old schoolhouses with separate " Boys " and " Girls " entrances are quaint in a way that makes us shake our heads . 	0
WD	2231	Then followed a couple of years of all-male university , until we were happily rolled over by the tidal wave of vintage 1970 coeducation , leaving the president to figure out how to keep his promise that we ' d produce " a thousand male leaders " every year ; so was born the cramped room students call a " forced triple . " 	0
WD	2232	As at many all-male institutions , the arrival of women didn ' t make a huge dent in the culture right away , and so it when I found myself the lone male at a girls ' summer camp ( the maintenance guy , often reeking slightly of rotting garbage ) I experienced culture shock . 	0
WD	2233	I know one " home-educated " kid . 	0
WD	2234	I ' m not a fan of the nanny state , but I can see why the government is doing this . 	0
WD	2235	The trouble is , home schooling can be a cover for all sorts of undesirable stuff . 	0
WD	2236	I don ' t want to be the hate figure here , but home schooling is probably always going to be the subject of some suspicion purely because any possible abuse wouldn ' t be able to be reported by any other pupils or teachers . 	0
WD	2237	As far as I can tell , the education he receives at home is pretty minimal - nothing like what you ' d get in school . 	0
WD	2238	And yeah , I agree that people shouldn ' t be automatically deisgnated as suspects for child abuse simply because they decide on home teaching . 	0
WD	2239	I ’ m ready . 	0
WD	2240	People generally do this because they want what is best for their children . 	0
WD	2241	For example , religion is a good thing . . . the public school does not believe in that . . . . . 	0
WD	2242	Lady , you need to get your head out of your *ss . 	0
WD	2243	There are plenty of good reasons for sending my kids to private school , and guess what , they are none of your business but here are a few . 	1
WD	2244	The government has proven over and over that they can not be trusted to do the right thing and I am not going to let them take over my child ' s education . 	0

WTP	2253	Arguing for common ancestor we use common characteristics of all organisms . 	0
WTP	2254	August 2006 ( UTC ) The source of diversity is explained by evolution : natural selection and genetic drift in the broadest possible sense . 	0
WTP	2255	The thoery of common ancestor does not rely on the concept of natural selection or genetic drift . 	0
WTP	2256	Rather it relies on the fact that all organisms have commonalities to them which are best explained by a common ancestor ( such as nucleotides , cell membrane , chirality of amino acids , genetic code ) ; notice that none of these can be used to create a phyloenetic tree of biodiversity as they are present in ' all organisms in the exact same state ( there are exeptions of course , but they are minor ) . 	0

WTP	2294	By quoting other sources instead of just writing without quotes , this alerts to the reader that the quote is different than the other statements in that it may come from a bias source ( which is not saying a source is necessarily bias ) , and so dissipates any hidden bias which keeps with the neutrality of the article . 	0

WTP	2312	Wow . 	0
WTP	2313	I don ' t think I ' ve ever seen so much civility in a Wikipedia abortion conversation . 	0
WTP	2314	However , your point is cogent . 	0
WTP	2315	I have already been looking for public-domain diagrams to add to dilation and extraction and dilation and curettage , though so far without success . 	0
WTP	2316	I assumed it was something accidental or miscommunicated , and so it was . 	0
WTP	2317	As for abortion as a surgical procedure , Ronabop , I think it ' s clear that most of the article is about induced abortion , as is most of the debate over the issue . 	0
WTP	2318	Nonetheless , adding it to those other articles in no way prevents us from placing a more medically accurate image in the induced abortion section of this article . 	0
WTP	2319	The question is whether that would be a good idea . 	0

WTP	2321	For me , the hip hop genre is relative , since it is not practiced by the singer . 	1
WTP	2322	Yes yes , my mistake . 	0
WTP	2323	You altered theorder , and you hoped that no one contests ? 	0
WTP	2324	And don ' t come up with this story that the article is mine . 	0
WTP	2325	Please . . . apparently you think that Wikipedia is yours . 	0
WTP	2326	That is correct , but this is an encyclopedia , not a scientific journal , which is why perhaps you ' re missing the point . 	1
WTP	2327	Quoting Nunh-huh , It ' s data that matters in science , not opinions , and not argument from authority . . 	0
WTP	2328	Remember , the point is to write a neutral , informative encyclopaedic article , covering not just scientific consensus but broader social issues too , which at times is a little trickier to get right . 	0
WTP	2329	The article needs to reflect Montaignier ' s point of view , as it ' s highly noteworthy , and is being widely used for various purposes related to HIV . 	0
WTP	2330	- 	0
WTP	2331	I ' ve fixed the wording a bit , however the fact that the figure is less than 0 . 02% just shows how irrelevent the sex scandal is in the entire overview of the Catholic Church , thats 99 . 98% who have absoutely nothing to do with sexual abuse scandals . 	1
WTP	2332	Not really worthy of inclusion if the number is so low . 	0
WTP	2333	Its probably far lower than such abuse cases in any other profession , whether it be a doctor , dentist , store worker , gym instructor , etc . . . we shouldn ' t make the article to pander to an American ( especially the sensationalistic media ) viewpoint only , since its supposed to represent the whole world view IMO . 	1
WTP	2334	Don ' t get me wrong , I agree that its good we have an actual figure , to disprove anti-catholic propoganda , but I think it could just as easily fit in " Vatican II and beyond " as its not relevent to the world in a full overview , I think thats the point Xander was trying to get across too . 	0
WTP	2335	If you refer to my argument , you see that I wrote this : so the Geneva Conventions DON ' T support your argument that Hamas ' actions differ from those of U . S . / israel . 	0
WTP	2336	maybe I need to clarify my position , as you don ' t seem to be able to understand … . this section is a discussion about whether using the term " employing terrorist tactics " is an appropriate term to use when writing on the " Hamas " wiki page . 	1
WTP	2337	. . . lol . . . . so . . . . the 5 links from diverse news / information sources are . . . . . my " opinion " ? ? ? … . . lol … . . 	0
WTP	2338	That would be in your eyes only . 	0
WTP	2339	I have supplied Burkes Peerage and information directly from the White House on this , so I feel that my additions have merit and are verifiable for anyone who wishes to take the time . 	1
WTP	2340	So I am asking you , please do not remove information which is relevant . 	0
WTP	2341	This type of thing is only hurting wikipedia because any intelligent person can tell you there is valid criticism of both Presidents . 	1
WTP	2342	You are wrong , for reasons I have already explained . 	0
WTP	2343	Primary sources should be used sparingly , and where there is controversy , not at all ( even the guideline you cite below makes this point clear ) . 	1
WTP	2344	I wouldn ' t worry too much about legibility in this case if they ' re described at least once - the ( t ) s / ( t ) z distinction has fallen by the way for the majority of speakers anyway . 	1
WTP	2345	Some useful resources , that include primary references if those are what you seek : a WP page on HIV and AIDS misconceptions that specifically addresses some of the denialist claims you ' re repeating ; the AIDS denialism page shows an electron microscopic image of HIV virions ; the AIDS connection maintained by the National Institutes of Health to address these concerns , which links to a Resources page that has links to more-detailed explanations . 	0
WTP	2346	I don ' t have high hopes of convincing you of anything , I just want to keep the page balanced and avoid giving denialism undue weight - HIV clearly causes AIDS . 	1

WTP	2348	I would question the wisdom of using any book that does not have this designation while creating the Beliefs section unless you intend to use the book to present a criticism or opposing viewpoint that is clearly stated as such . 	1
WTP	2349	I checked your new source " Catholicism : New Study Edition--Completely Revised and Updated by Richard P . Mcbrien " This book is written by the famous controversial professor of Notre Dame and does not have a Nihil Obstat or Imprimatur like my sources do . 	0
WTP	2350	Nihil Obstat and Imprimatur means that the book is declared to be free of doctrinal and moral error by the church . 	0

WTP	2352	Most of their stuff until the ' 80s is still very much bluesy . 	0
WTP	2353	Zeppelin had at least one slow , doomy song in the ' 60s . 	0
WTP	2354	It could be argued that Blue Cheer was doing similar stuff in the ' 60s . 	0
WTP	2355	I ' ve heard the whole ' Sabbath discarded the blues ' thing before , and I don ' t really see it . 	0
WTP	2356	Gillan ' s screaming and Blackmore ' s classical-inspired riffs were easily as ahead-of-their-time as Sabbath ' s gloom , doom and occult-ish themes . 	0
WTP	2357	You know , I agree with Dumu a bit . 	0
WTP	2358	Modern Basque is not " pre-Indo-European " unless it hasn ' t changed since ( Proto - ) Indo-European began being spoken . 	0
WTP	2359	The important information conveyed by the sentence in question is that Basque is a language isolate . 	0
WTP	2360	Presumably it descends from a non-IE language that was spoken in the Pyrenees region before the arrival of Indo-European speakers , and is in that sense " pre-Indo-European " ; some scholarly references call Basque a " pre-Indo-European " language in this way . 	0
WTP	2361	But others simply use " non-Indo-European " , which avoids giving the impression that Basque hasn ' t changed since primeval times ; so I ' d prefer to use " non-Indo-European " rather than " pre-Indo-European " . 	0
WTP	2362	Joe407 , polls on Wikipedia are not subsitutes for discussion . 	0

WTP	2365	If one speaks of evolution one does automatically refer to the state of the art in an scientific evolutionary context . 	0
WTP	2366	Same facts , just without the " terrorism " label you so strongly oppose . 	0
WTP	2367	And let me make something clear - regardless of who ' s interpretation of that page is more accurate , it ' s not policy , but a guideline , meaning it is only there to give advice , and is not a hard-set rule . 	0
WTP	2368	Is Hamas not doing them ? 	0

WTP	2370	Jeez ! 	0
WTP	2371	In either case , this isn ' t moving forward . 	0
WTP	2372	Well to me , as an old fart , this multiplicity of sub-sub-sub-genres is both divisive and unnecessary , since these terms seem to be created either by rock journalists , whom Frank Zappa once described as " people , who can ' t write , interviewing people , who can ' t talk , for people , who can ' t read . " , or by the fans themselves in order to distinguish themselves from some other sub-sect . 	1
WTP	2373	The most ghits seem to be found supporting that Rihanna is R&B , then pop , and I only found that allmusic source supporting reggae . 	0
WTP	2374	On the other hand , more references can be found describing Rihanna as pop and R&B ( for pop , ghits for : rihanna " pop singer " , rihanna " pop star " ; for R&B , ghits for : rihanna " r&b singer " ) . 	1
WTP	2375	Very few references can be found to support that Rihanna is a reggae singer , all I managed to find was her allmusic page which lists reggae after pop , and lists both as styles under the main genre R&B . 	1
WTP	2376	This is a new discussion , to gain new consensus . 	0
WTP	2377	– 	0
WTP	2378	Reggae was only prominent on her first album . 	0
WTP	2379	Also , the well-cited section in this article discussing her musical style seems to have sources that support that Rihanna started out as reggae before moving on to R&B and pop . 	0
WTP	2380	http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7814054.stm Did the UNRWA ever claim the Israeli missiles that killed the 42 people at the school had landed inside the school grounds ? 	0
WTP	2381	Here ' s the BBCNews summary that is in bold at the top of their Jan . 7 , 2009 story : At least 40 people were killed and 55 injured when Israeli artillery shells landed outside a United Nations-run school in Gaza , UN officials have said . 	0
WTP	2382	We know from the BBCNews report that UN officials at the school said missiles landed just outside the school . 	1

WTP	2384	" Pro-life " actually does apply directly to contraception , from a Catholic understanding , because of both " emergency contraception " ( which many argue is abortion ) and the belief that any artificial contraception denies the potential for life . 	1
WTP	2385	When we do mention pro-life , we just shouldn ' t separate contraception too far . 	0
WTP	2386	- 	0
WTP	2387	Because I thought the sexual abuse paragraph needed a little more context in order to not be so anti-Catholic POV per Xandars comments above , I added info relating to the sexual abuse by teachers in public schools . 	0
WTP	2388	The AP news article specifically compares the US public school scandals to the Roman Catholic Church . 	0
WTP	2389	On this talk page , and at Talk : System of a Down , there is clearly a consensus . 	0

WTP	2391	It ' s not equivalent to a photograph or even a basic diagram . 	0
WTP	2392	With all due respect , Ronabob , we have essentially a cave painting of an abortion . 	0
WTP	2393	Of course not . 	0
WTP	2394	Would it be up to wiki-standards if , say , Wikipedia had only a cave painting of a deer in the article on deer ? 	0
WTP	2395	— The preceding unsigned comment was added by 	0
WTP	2396	Now , I don ' t mean to equivocate between the deer article and the abortion article , but I do mean to point out that your equivocation is deeply flawed . 	0
WTP	2397	Why don ' t we also create " Male inventions " , " Female inventions " , " Morning inventions " , " Afternoon inventions " , " Atheist inventions " , " Agnostic inventions " ? 	0

WTP	2399	We aren ' t out to shock our readers for the sake of it , but we do want to present all the facts in the most encylcopedic and illustrative manner possible . 	0
WTP	2400	So it would seem that nearly half of surgical articles already largely agree with Talv ' s position that these things should be shown . 	1
WTP	2401	Of the 47 articles labeled that were not labeled as stubs ( and there were several that * should * have been so labeled , but were not , and are still included in the 47 ) , 20 included detailed depictions of the related surgery , whether it be a medical diagram of the procedure , a diagram or image of the tumor / organ to be removed / destroyed , a photograph of the surgery in progress , or a photo of the result ( e . g . a vagina after clitoridectomy , or a post - amputation human hand ) . 	0
WTP	2402	Furthermore , I think we should make a distinction between shock photos and medically explicit depictions . 	0
WTP	2403	Whether that should apply to abortion is the question at hand here . 	0
WTP	2404	What points ? 	0
WTP	2405	Wikipedia biography articles are not simply about a person ' s career , nor should they be ; they are about that person ' s life . 	0
WTP	2406	Trying to paraphrase your argument , you say that reliable sources should be used , but that some editors only want to use reliable sources that are authoritative voices regarding pseudoscientific concepts . 	0
WTP	2407	I don ' t think you are making a clear point Levine2112 . 	0
WTP	2408	However then you go one to say that these sources are themselves pseudoscientific because they are authorities on pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	2409	Such authoritative sources speak for the consensus in the scientific community . 	0
WTP	2410	Authorities in science which make comments on pseudoscience are not pseudoscientific themselves . 	0
WTP	2411	That is a very careless argument . 	1
WTP	2412	Also the presence of sources which support one viewpoint does not mean that contrasting viewpoint sources are needed if the contrasting sources are fringe science . 	1
WTP	2413	Neither are authorities which specialize in discussing pseudoscience provided they stick to scientific consensus . 	0
WTP	2414	See Fringe theories # Parity of sources . 	0
WTP	2415	Yes it was . 	0
WTP	2416	Please do not make unilateral changes while discussion is taking place . 	0

WTP	2419	With regard to 	0
WTP	2420	I disambiguated the image of the Irish flag in the hsitory section to state is it the flag of the country of Ireland , so there ' s no mistakes about it being the flag of the island of Ireland , which there isn ' t one . 	0
WTP	2421	It ' s at best distantly related , and we already have as many wartime images as are needed . 	0
WTP	2422	This isn ' t a slideshow of gruesome war images , so I ' m removing it . 	0
WTP	2423	No . 	0
WTP	2424	Something that is correct . 	0
WTP	2425	In fact Richard Dawkins put it this way : When one speaks of biology nowadays one esentially speaks of evolutionary biology because biology only makes sense in an evolutionary context " . 	0
WTP	2426	Nowadays Evolution spans from physics especially quantum mechanics to quantum chemistry , medicine over virtually the whole biological field . 	0
WTP	2427	The one refers to darwin who borrowed more or less the idea , the crux if you so will , filling one book gradually another . 	0
WTP	2428	If one speaks of the theory of evolution one rather means the theory of natural selection . 	0
WTP	2429	Evolution and Theory of Evolution are principally NOT the same . 	1
WTP	2430	Appending to the thread below , let me explain something . 	0
WTP	2431	We don ' t know yet . 	0
WTP	2432	See CCR5 for one known resistance factor to HIV infection . 	0
WTP	2433	HIV has an extremely long incubation period , which allows it to spread more quickly . 	0
WTP	2434	And my understanding is that it might not kill 100% of the people it infects . . . 	0
WTP	2435	What we have to remember is that this is not a list of pseudosciences , but rather a collection of topics which have been characterized as pseudoscience by some notable source . 	0
WTP	2436	Does that make sense ? 	0
WTP	2437	I think with proper attribution and context ( historical , academic , etc . ) , we can include items which even in our heart of hearts know are not pseudoscientific and there won ' t be any NPOV problems with this article . 	0
WTP	2438	Being included in this list means not that the item is pseudoscientific , but rather that it has the unique distinction of having been called pseudoscientific by some notable source . 	0
WTP	2439	Please feel free to pick everything I say apart for analysis and I ' d be happy to go over it with you even further .   : - ) - - 	0
WTP	2440	But when we act like this - when we disallow based on our own views - then we have an NPOV problem on our hands . 	0
WTP	2441	Some of us seem to be making a judgment based on our own views of what is and what isn ' t pseudoscience , and we feel that it is wrong to mention psychoanalysis in the same breath as phrenology . 	0
WTP	2442	I hope my verbosity has cleared up my point and has not obscured it even more . 	0
WTP	2443	But until we are all open to that , I ' m afraid that this article will have NPOV issues . 	0

WTP	2450	Everything else can be part of History of the Israel Defense Forces , which for some reason no one wants to work on . 	0
WTP	2451	Therefore I believe there should be a controversy section but it should be small and deal with controversies that have historical significance . 	0
WTP	2452	Moreover , Wikifan is quite right about not having such sections for other armies . 	0
WTP	2453	I bet some Wikipedians would like that , but this would not lead to a balanced article . 	0
WTP	2454	If you can find such sources , it would be interesting to have a look , but if we including the Liberty incident , we might as well have a 100-page controversy section detailing every screw-up the IDF has ever made . 	0
WTP	2455	I ' ve read a few books on general IDF history ( as opposed to specific episodes ) , and none of them talk in-depth about the USS Liberty incident or attribute it significance in the long term . 	0
WTP	2456	However , from an historical point of view , it ' s a fairly small incident that had almost no influence on anything . 	1
WTP	2457	The USS Liberty incident is well-known because it was one of the greatest friendly fire debacles in Israeli history and also as one of the main US-related incidents in IDF history . 	0
WTP	2458	As Shuki correctly noted , we have to put the events in perspective . 	0
WTP	2459	I fully agree . 	1
WTP	2460	I was just expressing dissatisfaction with the meme , which makes a comparison between Bush ' s administration and Obama ' s that is superficial in every way except the realm of political fallout . 	0

WTP	2465	Regarding this edit where I removed the following links from within quotes with the edit summary " rm links from within quotes per WP : MOSQUOTE ( + 1 WP : REPEATLINK ) ) " . . and LibiBamizrach ' s revert , with the edit summary " this rule you show says " avoid as much as possible " , not say it ' s not allowed . 	0
WTP	2466	I think it is OR to assume that the archaic slang was abandoned because of the sexual slang . 	0
WTP	2467	I don ' t doubt that it is true , but I think it would need a reference . 	0
WTP	2468	I agree that archaic slang doesn ' t add much understanding . 	0
WTP	2469	The recent edit is better , but could even be shorter . 	0
WTP	2470	" In the past there were varying levels of belief in a flat Earth , but this was displaced by the concept of a spherical Earth due to observation and circumnavigation . 	0
WTP	2471	The human perspective regarding the Earth has changed following the advent of spaceflight , and the biosphere is now widely viewed from a globally integrated perspective . 	0
WTP	2472	This is reflected in a growing environmental movement that is concerned about humankind ' s effects on the planet . " 	0
WTP	2473	Oddly enough , none of these people are referred to as " denialists . " 	0
WTP	2474	Such assertions are opposed by the scientific community and other religious groups . 	0
WTP	2475	A prominent example is the creation-evolution controversy . " 	0
WTP	2476	Obama said the government was giving the orders in the aftermath , but that BP had not always followed what official have asked , such as considering alternatives to chemical dispersants used . 	0
WTP	2477	[ 5 ] Early the next month , the LMRP containment cap was successfully deployed . [ 6 ] 	0
WTP	2478	So , in fact , source reliability comes down to whether or not the source is trustworthy at representing the characterization reliably . 	0
WTP	2479	The lead even states that some of the items included in this list are not necessarily pseudoscientific , but merely have been characterized as such by some notable source . 	0
WTP	2480	Characterize , in terms of the inclusion criteria in the lead of this article , is weaker than definitively labelling something . 	0
WTP	2481	We are no longer just looking for sources which are regarded as trustworthy / authoritative in terms of definitively naming topics which are and aren ' t pseudoscience , but rather just looking for notable sources which are regarded as trustworthy / authoritative in terms of characterizing topics as pseudoscience . 	1
WTP	2482	So , in terms of WP : RS , our focus has shifted from the article which I described in the paragraph above . 	0
WTP	2483	For instead of relying on sources which satisfy PSCI and can be used to definitively call something pseudoscience , we allow for merely notable sources which have in some way , shape , or form characterized an item as pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	2484	This is what we are currently working with - a list with grey inclusionary criteria . 	0
WTP	2485	Grey comes in when this article ceases being a " List of pseudosciences " and instead is a " List of topics characterized as pseudoscience " . 	0
WTP	2486	Now where does the " grey " come in ? 	0
WTP	2487	Does that make sense ? 	0
WTP	2488	What ' s the problem now ? 	0
WTP	2489	One way the other side of that argument makes its case is to point to Israel making exactly the same charge against Hezbollah and showing how that was received / resolved . 	0
WTP	2490	The reference directly addresses the charge by Israel that Hamas deliberately puts its militia in close proximity to civilians . 	0
WTP	2491	See title of section . 	0
WTP	2492	I ' m fine with it how it is now ( the three pics on the right ) . 	0
WTP	2493	In the intro ? ! ? 	0
WTP	2494	There is a lot more to the subject than that , and images don ' t have to be of dead bodies themselves . 	1
WTP	2495	It doesn ' t boil down to censorship at all , it boils down to not having an article full photographs of dead bodies from the last century ' s wars . 	0
WTP	2496	I think people are intelligent enough to make the connection between Atilla the Hun charging into Rome and there being some death here and there - if there wasn ' t I ' m awfully confused as to why they have all those weapons , and why they are in such a hurry . 	0
WTP	2497	The fact that it ' s difficult to sucessfully falsify , and no-one ' s done it , doesn ' t make it pseudoscience by any stretch . 	0
WTP	2498	So , it ' s a valid research programme , and a widely published geneticist has said that it hasn ' t been falsified . 	0

WTP	2505	Whether it deserves mention in the LEAD or not , if you ' re going to remove prose , at least have the decency to move the citations to where they belong . 	0
WTP	2506	Neither the John Jay article , nor the Gospel of Shame mention abortion , euthanasia , etc . - - 	0
WTP	2507	In its current state , the article only notes the ' 9 out of every 10 ' figure in the lead and doesn ' t repeat or expand upon it in the body - - which it should . 	0
WTP	2508	The title is thrown around constantly to many different artists ( Beyonce , Mariah , Mary J , Ciara ) and to put it as a fact in the beginning of the article is invalid and not noteworthy due to the source being one article on a gossip website . 	0
WTP	2509	I think it ' s hardly fair to call her the Queen of RnB in 2007 just on the basis of one article . 	1

WTP	2512	I am certainly not looking forward to discussions about whether Quackwatch can be used that focus on the question whether it is pseudosceptic . 	0
WTP	2513	But there is no need to make up new rules for this list to deal with the problemInitially I was puzzled what Fyslee was driving at because when I hear pseudosceptic I think of much more mainstream phenomena such as Randi . 	0
WTP	2514	If someone really wants to argue for that , let ' s take it to the reliable sources noticeboard . 	0
WTP	2515	Does anyone really believe that anti-psychiatry sources from a hermetic science fiction religion are reliable in any reasonable sense of the word ? 	0
WTP	2516	I agree 100% with Enric . 	0
WTP	2517	You can merely present the information available at the time . 	0
WTP	2518	To hide information , rather that to include it , as well as the reasons it may be inaccurate , is censorship , and unethical when presenting in an Encyclopedia . 	0
WTP	2519	Think of them men who lost their freedom and lives because they claimed the earth was round . 	0
WTP	2520	You cannot present the truth , as the truth changes from person to person and over time . 	1
WTP	2521	Within that group , some believe that HIV does not exist , some believe it exists but does not cause AIDS , while others believe that HIV can merely contribute to AIDS in the presence of other ailments . 	0
WTP	2522	The point being is that just because something is thought to be incorrect , does not make it so . 	0
WTP	2523	EDIT : I will rescind my view to put a picture into the article . 	0
WTP	2524	I respect the upkeepers of the article who , as far as i ' m concered , are those active enough to check the Talk page . 	0
WTP	2525	If something becomes an edit war over an already good article , it isn ' t worth it . 	0
WTP	2526	How is it that I ' m saying Hamas " . . . isn ' t targeting cvilians " ? ? ? ? 	0
WTP	2527	I only add that the U . S . , israel and almost every other country that has waged war in history , targets civlians AS WELL ( as per the definitions of the Geneva Conventions ) , so it is only fair to use the term " employing terrorist tactics " on the " Hamas " wiki page ONLY if the same standards are used on the wiki pages of other governing bodies who have been shown to " employ " the same " tactics " . 	0
WTP	2528	As my statement ( and supporting references of the Geneva Convention articles and news sources ) clearly show that I DO believe Hamas targets civlians . … … 	1

WTP	2538	Why it shouldn ' t be there : as much as the conflict seems significant , it actually does not appear to be that important in an historical perspective , the way we should be looking at the article . 	0

WTP	2560	Anyway , comparing Operation Cast Lead to the Second Lebanon War is clueless at best . 	1
WTP	2561	It follows a recent trend in worldwide media to assess the scale of a conflict by civilian casualties , which , indeed , is completely irrelevant . 	0
WTP	2562	The Second Lebanon War was far larger in scale , both military and political . 	0
WTP	2563	But forget that ; the real problem with adding this " war " is that it ' s not even a war . 	1
WTP	2564	Aside from the media , there is no evidence that the historical record refers to it as a war ; it is simply recentism . 	0
WTP	2565	Comparetively , Operation Defensive Shield was also referred to as a war by many media sources , and probably Operation Litani ( although I wasn ' t alive then and so couldn ' t follow the media ) . 	0
WTP	2566	In addition , Israel very clear defines what is a war and what isn ' t , so at least the first instance of the addition , which clearly refers to " Israel ' s wars " , shouldn ' t be there . 	0
WTP	2567	In light of the above , I have two very important questions for you , which I request that you ( and anyone else wishing to add information about Cast Lead to this article ) address : — 	0

WTP	2576	The recent announcement by Gero Hütter , first in the media and later as a case report in the NEJM , is quite notable and also very encouraging . 	0

WTP	2613	What accounts for that counter-intuitive 20% drop in the HIV - > AIDS progression rate from the subjects infected 10 and 15 years prior ? 	0
WTP	2614	This is slightly confusing ( at least to me ) because the abstract also mentions that only 68% of HIV-positive subjects infected 14 years prior progressed to AIDS . 	0
WTP	2615	Thus , 92% - - about 9 out of every 10 - - of the HIV-positive subjects progressed to AIDS within 10 years of infection . 	1

WTP	2628	With regards to this edit : I planned to simply trim it and then put the bulk of it in the South Park controversies Then I realized it was copied word-for word from the source , and was wondering if a few vague threats from a handful of users on the website mentioned in the source was really notable enough to be deemed a " controversy " yet . 	0

WTP	2632	It ' s not ROS ' fault that the truth IS shocking , and his suggestion shouldn ' t necessarily be shot down for it . 	0
WTP	2633	If there is a crowded street in Calcutta with starving children , although it contains " shock value " to see it , it ' s the truth , isn ' t it ? 	0
WTP	2634	So I think they ' re fair as they are . 	0
WTP	2635	And in regard to the two pictures already up in the abortion debate section , although the editor wanted a " better quality " picture for the pro-choice representation , one could also argue that the pro-life representation contains about three people , while the pro-choice one is a sea of people . 	0
WTP	2636	Just because Ros has a blatant anti-abortion bias does not mean that his argument has no value . 	0
WTP	2637	I think both sides of the debate here have very good points , and I would like to see what Ros might come up with . 	0
WTP	2638	If a picture that accurately represents an abortion - or perhaps one being performed ( he does mention abortion procedures in his first post ) - can actually be agreed upon by a majority as something worthwhile , I don ' t see a problem with it being added . 	0
WTP	2639	Based on my research and your research , we need to include certain specific facts if we want to tell an accurate story in the article . 	0

WTP	2649	I think we need to only include those parodies that have reliable sources for them , or are from well known sources . 	0
WTP	2650	" Sad Kermit " has been mentioned in at least two major newspapers , and the " Family Guy " parodies qualify as they ' re from a major TV series so they both qualify . 	1

WTP	2654	Ultrasound . 	1
WTP	2655	I think not . 	0
WTP	2656	Nonetheless , we seem to have acheived a consensus : more illustrative images would be a good thing , but " shock " pictures will not be accepted unless the article somehow directly concerns such images ( e . g . in the pro-life article , perhaps ) . 	0
WTP	2657	The article on amputation shows a hand minus two fingers . 	0
WTP	2658	Should that picture be moved to the hand article ? 	0
WTP	2659	I noticed this change to the article " In fact recent research has calculated that only one per cent of those convicted by Inquisition tribunals eventually received death penalties " A previous source used said that 3-4% of those convicted in the Spanish Inquision were executed . 	0
WTP	2660	1% may be accurate over all of the Inquisitions , but I think this will need to be made more clear , since the previous sentences detail the Spanish Inquisition . 	1
WTP	2661	More can be found at http://physics.gmu.edu/~roerter/EvolutionEntropy.htm . 	0

WTP	2663	Roland Deschain : I did not mean that the net energy output of the sun is zero . 	1
WTP	2664	Instead , I meant that the net energy gain of the earth is zero . 	0
WTP	2665	I ' m sorry , I think I didn ' t explain it properly . . . 	0
WTP	2666	The current sentence says " The Sun provides a large amount of energy to the Earth , and this flow of heat results in huge increases in entropy " - which is true but it ignores the fact that the earth is emitting all of this energy back into space . 	0
WTP	2667	The point of all of this is that since the net effect is an increase in entropy outside of the earth , the earth can " afford " to lose entropy without violating the second law . 	0
WTP	2668	Therefore the " entropy argument " by the creationists is faulty . 	1
WTP	2669	All energy taken in from the sun is emitted back out into space . 	0
WTP	2670	The net effect of this is a net increase of entropy in the system that includes the sun and the space , and that ' s what I meant by saying that the sun is a " source of negative energy " . . . 	0

WTP	2675	I am not sure about why this might be considered to be undue weight . 	0
WTP	2676	The IDF , rightly in my view , has a history of claiming the high moral ground in its general conduct , with abuses being unusual rather than the norm . 	0

WTP	2678	As far as how long a brain can go without O2 is an interesting topic and who knows what future possibilities medicine holds in store for us . 	0

WTP	2710	Cool . 	0
WTP	2711	It would be a yes or a no situation - or as I say above - it would be a black-or-white situation . 	0
WTP	2712	Either we have sources which verify that the scientific community generally considers a topic pseudoscience or we do not ; and that determines whether we would include it in such a list or not . 	0
WTP	2713	This means that these sources represent the general consideration of the scientific community . 	0
WTP	2714	I was saying that if a source is regarded as trustworthy / authoritative in terms of definitively naming topics which are and aren ' t pseudoscience ( a reliable source for describing what is and what isn ' t pseudoscience ) , then in terms of Wikipedia these sources satisy WP : PSCI and we can use them to definitively describe a topic as pseudoscientific . 	0
WTP	2715	I definitely wasn ' t calling any sources " pseudoscientific " . 	1
WTP	2716	@Sifaka - As you suspected , you misunderstood what I wrote ; probably because my language wasn ' t clear . 	0
WTP	2717	We could call this " List of pseudosciences " where either an item is clearly pseudoscience and it is included or it is not clearly pseudoscience and it is not included . 	0
WTP	2718	There would be no need for " characterized " in the title of this list , because per PSCI , we can definitively label items as " pseudoscience " if the sources show that the item is generally considered pseudoscience by the scientific community . 	1
WTP	2719	If all we were using in this article were these kinds of sources , then we would not merely be listing items that have been " characterized " as pseudoscience , but rather listing items that are pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	2720	I would imagine that these sources include highly-regarded scientific journals and various academies of science . 	0

WTP	2768	I haven ' t looked at " power metal " , but if funk metal is so poorly-sourced in its own article that it cannot be sourced from mainstream rock journalism , then it really isn ' t a " genre " , but a " sub-genre " or " style " at best . 	0

WTP	2778	This is why the Geneva Conventions clearly state that any use of a " protected " place for military purposes strips it of those protections , and the presence of " protected persons " , i . e civilians , does not prevent a legal attack . 	0
