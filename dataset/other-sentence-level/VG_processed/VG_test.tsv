VG	309	In a speech that appears to have been timed for the upcoming elections , President Bush attacked the Senate this week for having a " lousy record " of confirming his judicial nominees . 	1
VG	310	The facts do not bear this out . 	0
VG	311	The Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed 80 judges in its first 15 months in power - more than the Republican-led Senate confirmed in its final 30 months in control , from 1999 through the summer of 2001 	0

VG	325	And it has aided , trained and harbored terrorists , including operatives of al Qaeda . 	0
VG	326	The danger is clear : using chemical , biological or , one day , nuclear weapons , obtained with the help of Iraq , the terrorists could fulfill their stated ambitions and kill thousands or hundreds of thousands of innocent people in our country , or any other . 	1
VG	327	Watching him once on a mobile phone to Mr Blair , striding up and down and wagging his finger , I felt I was hallucinating : surely here was the Prime Minister issuing orders to an official rather than the other way round ? 	0
VG	328	He has called him " a prat " in front of one witness , has told him to " get a f----- - move on " when he believes a meeting has gone on too long , and instructed him to drop what he is doing and concentrate on something else " because it can ' t f----- - wait " . 	0

VG	338	The second argument I want to give against God ' s existence draws attention to the fact that the definition of God in classical Christianity is , I think , contradictory . 	0
VG	339	As far I know , it ' s common to think of God as an abstract object , the kind of abstract object that Professor Craig talked about . 	0
VG	340	God is said to be timeless , and the only timeless things around are abstract objects . 	0
VG	341	At the same time , it ' s believed that God is causally efficacious , that is that God can affect material objects . 	0
VG	342	God brought the universe into existence , we ' re told , and God can influence the events of the world on a day-to-day , hour-to-hour , and second-to-second basis . 	0
VG	343	The problems is that abstracts objects , as standardly understood , have no causal properties . 	0
VG	344	Just think about this for a moment . 	0
VG	345	Think about the classical examples of abstract objects . 	0
VG	346	The tyrant will soon be gone . 	0

VG	357	Does he accept that , if that is rolled over for the beginning of 2005 , there is a risk that that will lead to the substantial dumping of haddock surely something that no one wants ? 	0
VG	358	The Minister is aware that the haddock permit management scheme has had very severe consequences for the Shetland white fish fleet in particular . 	0
VG	359	The Army of Palestine is claiming responsibility for yesterday ' s atrocity , but that does not rule out the involvement of bin Laden ' s organisation ; when the American embassy in Nairobi was bombed in 1998 , al-Qa ' eda operated in the name of the Islamic Army against the Jews and the Crusaders . 	1
VG	360	That suggests he does not plan to carry out Mr . Blix ' s order to destroy missiles that exceed performance limits set by the U . N . 	0
VG	361	A Council visibly moving toward authorizing force is the last remote hope of getting Iraq to disarm peacefully . 	1
VG	362	Saddam Hussein reinforced that point himself yesterday by telling Dan Rather of CBS News that Iraqi missiles do not violate U . N . restrictions . 	0

VG	382	This doctrine has implications I find appalling . 	0
VG	383	It implies that those among us who lack faith in Jesus have not received grace , have not been forgiven , and will , if we continue in that state , go to Hell . 	0
VG	384	So the doctrine of justification by faith , which has strong support in the Christian scriptures , leads inevitably to exclusivism , to the idea that all who reject Christian doctrine must be damned , no matter how good they may be , by ordinary standards . 	1
VG	385	Consistently with the doctrine of original sin , it is common among Christians to believe that if we are justified , it is by faith in Jesus . 	0
VG	386	Since we are all sinners , we cannot earn salvation by our works . 	0
VG	387	But we can be forgiven and treated as if we were righteous . 	0
VG	388	The mark of our having been forgiven is that God , by an act of grace , gives us faith . 	0

VG	463	It is crucial that this specialized form of bankruptcy relief for family farmers not be allowed to sunset for two fundamental reasons . 	1
VG	464	First , family farmers , absent chapter 12 , would be forced to file for bankruptcy relief under the Bankruptcy Code ' s other al-ternatives , none of which work as well for them as does chapter 12 . 	0
VG	465	Chapter VII of the Bankruptcy Code , for instance , would require a farmer to liquidate ; that is , sell the family farm to pay the claims of the farmer ' s credi-tors . 	0
VG	466	Many farmers would be precluded from choosing bankruptcy relief under chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code be-cause of its restrictive eligibility standards . 	0
VG	467	Furthermore , Chapter XI , the Bankruptcy Code ' s business reorga-nization alternative , is not farmer-friendly in various respects , as it often entails an expensive and time-con-suming process that does not readily accommodate the special needs of farmers . 	0
VG	468	Second , recent statistics dem-onstrate that there is not only a con-tinuing need for chapter 12 , but that this need is apparently increasing . 	0
VG	469	Ac-cording to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts , chapter 12 bankruptcy filings jumped by more than 62 percent over the past year . 	0
VG	470	I in-troduced H . R . 2465 to extend chapter 12 for an additional 6 months through De-cember 31 , 2003 , and thereby maintain the status quo while the Congress com-pletes its consideration of comprehen-sive bankruptcy reform . 	0

VG	482	This could prove problematic if the US expansion falters , or the dollar continues to fall http://www.weforum.org/site/knowledgenavigator.nsf/Content/A%20CEO%20Perspective%20on%20the%20World%20Economy_2004?open&event_id=1085&year_id=2004 	0

VG	499	When ' s the last time you slipped on the concept of truth ? 	0
VG	500	Let me just cite the Harper Collins Dictionary of Philosophy , which defines material objects as " an object that causally interacts or inter-relates with other independently existing things . " 	0
VG	501	An abstract object is defined as " an object that is not a material object , " so an abstract object is an object that does not causally interact with other indepedently existing things . 	0

VG	507	I would reject the first hypothesis for two reasons . 	0
VG	508	First , it is the practice of parliamentary draftsmen to show an abundance of caution and to favour the avoidance of doubt . 	0
VG	509	In considering the intention of Parliament when passing the 1985 Act , or perhaps more properly the intention of the draftsman in settling its terms , there are three ( but only three ) hypotheses to be considered : ( 1 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because it was regarded as clear that the 1938 Act would continue to operate , in cases to which it applied , irrespective of the terms of Part V ; ( 2 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because it was not in the mind of the draftsman of Part V ; ( 3 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because Part V was not seen to encroach upon or conflict with the operation of section 5 . 	1
VG	510	9 . 	0
VG	511	The Prime Minister has described global warming as the most serious environmental threat to the planet , and we know that a major accelerator is the emission of carbon dioxide and other carbon gases . 	0
VG	512	British Energy has pointed out that the generation of about 64 TWh or 64 , 000 GWh by its nuclear power stations avoids the production and generation of about 40 million tonnes of carbon dioxide . 	0
VG	513	Secondly , had the draftsman conceived that a secure tenant ' s right to buy could be subject to a condition of ministerial consent under section 5 that right would not have been defined in section 118 in the terms quoted in paragraph 7 above , and provision would have been made for asserting and admitting or denying , and handling , claims to exercise the right to buy where ministerial consent was required . 	0
VG	514	If I concluded ( as I do not ) that section 5 was intended to operate in cases covered by Part V , I would agree with Buxton LJ that the Part V procedures could be made to work , but the absence of any indication that the procedures were devised to apply to conditional rights fortifies the inference that section 5 was not intended to operate in cases covered by Part V . Had it been so intended , the draftsman would have imposed a duty on a local authority to refer to the Secretary of State a claim to exercise the right to buy made by a tenant whose case fell within section 5 . 	0
