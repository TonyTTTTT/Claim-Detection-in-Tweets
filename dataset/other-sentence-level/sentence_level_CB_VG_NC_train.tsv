ClaimBuster	0	Four years ago, in similar circumstances to this, I asked you, the American people, a question.	0
ClaimBuster	1	If you make $200,000 a year or less, your taxes will go down.	1
ClaimBuster	2	And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget.	1
ClaimBuster	3	We'll negotiate with the drug companies for the cheapest available price on drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	4	If you don't know what you're supposed to know, we'll make sure you do early before it's too late.	0
ClaimBuster	5	Now, as long as we put up with that, that's what you're going to get.	0
ClaimBuster	6	That's what I'm going to do as president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	7	The meaning of this election is the future and whether we're going to grow and provide the jobs and the opportunities for all Americans and that they need.	0
ClaimBuster	8	And the other thing is part of AIDS -- it's one of the few diseases where behavior matters.	0
ClaimBuster	9	I'm for doing something both on the supply side and production side and on the consumption side.	0
ClaimBuster	10	Don't forget that, that happened in 1993.	1
ClaimBuster	11	I simply don't want to see the ratings on movies.	0
ClaimBuster	12	And that's why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor Romney's pledge of not reducing the deficit or -- or -- or not adding to the deficit is by burdening middle-class families.	1
ClaimBuster	13	It's ad hoc, it's sort of we get up in the morning and read the papers, what country's in trouble, we'll have a meeting.	0
ClaimBuster	14	The President is still going to be president for the next four months and he, of course, is the only one who could commit this country in this period.	1
ClaimBuster	15	And I think that racial profiling is part of a larger issue of how we deal with race in America.	0
ClaimBuster	16	What bothers me is this growing tendency to try to use one's own personal interpretation of faith politically, to question others' faith, and to try to use the instrumentalities of government to impose those views on others.	0
ClaimBuster	17	Senator Obama has opposed that.	1
ClaimBuster	18	The government's bigger than it was when President Kennedy was around, even though he says it's not.	1
ClaimBuster	19	One of the more important things we're doing in this administration is transformation.	0
ClaimBuster	20	I remember working with Senator Ribicoff from Connecticut on the Hospice program.	1
ClaimBuster	21	That is not the kind of leadership that you need, but you should expect that those are promises he's going to keep.	0
ClaimBuster	22	Well, it's not only my opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	23	Honor, duty, and country, that's what America is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	24	"I've even scaled back some of my favorite programs already, like the child-care program I wanted to fund and the national service program, because the president's deficit keeps growing and I've said as a pledge, ""I'm going to cut the deficit in half in four years."""	0
ClaimBuster	25	The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough.	0
ClaimBuster	26	I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity.	1
ClaimBuster	27	I, too, am pledged to a Social Security program that will reassure these senior citizens of ours that they are going to continue to get their money.	0
ClaimBuster	28	So entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America together and having a discussion on this important topic, you pushed through something that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best answer and drove it through.	1
ClaimBuster	29	We have to work with the police.	0
ClaimBuster	30	It's been a big failure.	0
ClaimBuster	31	It's no difference than this.	0
ClaimBuster	32	We expected one at the time of the Vietnam War, but it was used up before we ever ended the war and taxpayers never got the adequate relief they deserved.	1
ClaimBuster	33	Well, we've seen what has happened.	0
ClaimBuster	34	And if you open the airways to more things like this, you see it's not just you that are participating here.	0
ClaimBuster	35	If I could say one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	36	And if you haven't noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow.	1
ClaimBuster	37	And they look and they see.	0
ClaimBuster	38	I can't tell you how much I love my wife and our daughters.	0
ClaimBuster	39	It's not what the American people thought they were getting when they voted.	0
ClaimBuster	40	I've generally supported it, but I've seen them make some calls that I thought were highly questionable.	0
ClaimBuster	41	We'll find out on November 8th.	0
ClaimBuster	42	That's a place where we can use our generosity to influence in a positive way, influence nations.	0
ClaimBuster	43	I see an involvement by a thousand points of light.	0
ClaimBuster	44	Not with quotas, but help meet a goal of ownership of small businesses, for example.	0
ClaimBuster	45	Our children get off to a better start from pre-school programs and smaller classes in the early grades, and we have one of the most aggressive adult education programs in the country.	0
ClaimBuster	46	But I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is.	0
ClaimBuster	47	As a matter of fact, the statement that Senator Kennedy made was that - to the effect that there were trigger-happy Republicans, that my stand on Quemoy and Matsu was an indication of trigger-happy Republicans.	1
ClaimBuster	48	The killer -- the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, Khalid Sheik Mohammed, is in prison.	1
ClaimBuster	49	Right now we heard it.	0
ClaimBuster	50	Now we've had this pause, but most economists, regardless of their political philosophy, uh - indicate that this pause for a month or two was healthy, because we could not have honestly sustained a 9.2 percent rate of growth which we had in the first quarter of this year.	1
ClaimBuster	51	Now, you're paying for that.	0
ClaimBuster	52	And he's also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasn't the case with me.	1
ClaimBuster	53	I said I would make sure that women would be safe who used the drug.	1
ClaimBuster	54	What you have to decide is who's got the best economic plan.	0
ClaimBuster	55	Secondly, I would not suggest the withdrawal at the point of the Communist gun.	0
ClaimBuster	56	You know, regulations cost the average family right here, Democrat or Republican, about $7,000 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	57	And when a President doesn't know that submarine missiles are recallable, says that 70 percent of our strategic forces are conventional, discovers 3 years into his administration that our arms control efforts have failed because he didn't know that most Soviet missiles were on land -- these are things a President must know to command.	1
ClaimBuster	58	But what you can do is create a fair playing field, and that's what I'm talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	59	I believe it would return the government closer to the people, the way that Ross Perot is talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	60	They want equal pay for comparable effort for women.	0
ClaimBuster	61	I don't like to see the people in a deteriorating economy in a deteriorating country because our government has lost touch with the people.	0
ClaimBuster	62	And I would do nothing to hurt the U.S. auto industry.	0
ClaimBuster	63	"Which is -- which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and -- and lay down a piece of legislation and say, ""It's my way or the highway,"" I don't get a lot done."	0
ClaimBuster	64	You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business.	1
ClaimBuster	65	And that's why in this campaign I'm telling you exactly what I want to do.	0
ClaimBuster	66	I believe that every agreement we reach must be verifiable, and I will not agree to anything that we cannot tell every day.	0
ClaimBuster	67	I would have hoped that the president of the United States would have been possible for him to indicate it clearly that uh - the Supreme Court decision was going to be carried out.	0
ClaimBuster	68	We have no country if we have no border.	0
ClaimBuster	69	I think you have to look at it.	0
ClaimBuster	70	On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half.	1
ClaimBuster	71	The President in the election year decided I ought to do something, I haven't done anything on drugs.	1
ClaimBuster	72	None of my proposals would have any effect on hunters, or sportsmen, or people who use rifles.	0
ClaimBuster	73	And one journal, the San Francisco Chronicle, a respected newspaper, said there was no question about the fact that Governor Reagan had prevented the State of California from going bankrupt.	1
ClaimBuster	74	Would fathers and mothers feel proud of themselves if they loaded their children with debts like this nation is now -- over a trillion dollars on the shoulders of our children?	1
ClaimBuster	75	But we have a different set of convictions about how we make our country stronger here at home and respected again in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	76	Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they're the job creators, they'd be burdened.	1
ClaimBuster	77	The Iranians have met with Ambassador Crocker in Baghdad.	1
ClaimBuster	78	They know what it's like not to have flexible working hours.	0
ClaimBuster	79	When I was a boy it took 2 generations to double the standard of living.	1
ClaimBuster	80	We've never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election.	1
ClaimBuster	81	I think that's the very best way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	82	But the hard reality is that we must know what we're doing and pursue those objectives that are possible in our time.	0
ClaimBuster	83	That's one way one could do it.	0
ClaimBuster	84	We encourage parents to take a look at the comparative results of schools.	0
ClaimBuster	85	Our unemployment rate is twice as high as it is in Italy; it's three or four times as high as it is - as it is in Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	86	In addition to that, we ought to have a - a shift toward the use of coal, particularly in the Appalachian regions where the coal is located.	1
ClaimBuster	87	And recently the Chinese have announced they are going to lower some barriers to our products, which they ought to do since they have a 15 billion dollar trade surplus with the United States under Mr. Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	88	Americans' workers are the best in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	89	Did anybody complain when you raised taxes?	0
ClaimBuster	90	I thought the administration was opposed to the Midgetman.	0
ClaimBuster	91	I will only say this, however, in addition: to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested - to suggest that we will surrender these islands or force our Chinese Nationalist allies to surrender them in advance - is not something that would lead to peace; it is something that would lead, in my opinion, to war.	0
ClaimBuster	92	There's no question about that.	0
ClaimBuster	93	He needed to be disarmed.	0
ClaimBuster	94	But they certainly are a little nervous when Senator Obama says, if you don't get the health care policy that I think you should have, then you're going to get fined.	0
ClaimBuster	95	It's going to go in the other direction, as they've estimated.	0
ClaimBuster	96	I believe that this struggle is going to go on, and it may be well decided in the next decade.	0
ClaimBuster	97	Candy, it's not going to --	0
ClaimBuster	98	But we've got to keep fighting on this war against drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	99	I believe they did the best they could under the circumstances, and let's not forget that hundreds of thousands of lives were saved there.	1
ClaimBuster	100	A President is called the Commander in Chief.	1
ClaimBuster	101	I think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that I think good people on both sides can disagree on.	0
ClaimBuster	102	It's a geopolitical foe, and I said in the same -- in the same paragraph I said, and Iran is the greatest national security threat we face.	1
ClaimBuster	103	Now what all this, of course, adds up to is this: America has not been standing still.	0
ClaimBuster	104	In fact, it's starting to fall apart not because of lawsuits -- though they are a problem, and John Edwards and I are committed to fixing them -- but because of the larger issue that we don't cover Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	105	As I told you, we've just got a report that said over the past 13 months, we've created 1.9 million new jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	106	We've got to go back and look.	0
ClaimBuster	107	If she did nothing, we'd be in much better shape.	0
ClaimBuster	108	I believe that we have uh - negotiated with the Soviet Union since I've been president from a position of strength.	1
ClaimBuster	109	I do know that we have a choice to make in America and that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity.	0
ClaimBuster	110	And I want to make sure they get armed and they have the arms necessary to defend themselves, but also to remove -- to remove Assad.	0
ClaimBuster	111	Unfortunately, a lot of people, have never been as concerned about the Kurds as the United States has tried to be, and we've been flying an operation to protect them out of Turkey for many years now.	1
ClaimBuster	112	They want jobs, they want to be able to make sure their kids are going to a good school.	0
ClaimBuster	113	It's probably going to take a much, much higher figure.	0
ClaimBuster	114	And I said I make a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	115	And I think I'm on the right track.	0
ClaimBuster	116	And despite that, what we've said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn't slip into a Great Depression, but what we've also said is, let's make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow.	1
ClaimBuster	117	We talk about schools - three times as many classrooms built in the past Administration - and Eisenhower - than under the Truman Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	118	And we put a stop to it and as a consequence saved jobs throughout America.	1
ClaimBuster	119	The secretary said very strongly about working with -- we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen.	0
ClaimBuster	120	She came all the way from Iowa in a Winnebago with her poodle in order attend here tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	121	I am adamantly opposed to legalizing drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	122	There is no question but that this nation cannot stand still; because we are in a deadly competition, a competition not only with the men in the Kremlin, but the men in Peking.	0
ClaimBuster	123	I think that should be a goal.	0
ClaimBuster	124	And it's going to require a new commander in chief to rebuild the military power.	0
ClaimBuster	125	We tried six or eight years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	126	I think they looked at that and saw weakness.	0
ClaimBuster	127	I've also done everything I could at every moment of division in this country, after Oklahoma City, when these churches were burned, to bring people together and remind people that we are stronger because of our diversity.	0
ClaimBuster	128	We also need to have a hemispheric energy policy where Canada, Mexico and the United States come together.	0
ClaimBuster	129	And that's my view now.	0
ClaimBuster	130	And it's -- our nation stands alone right now in the world in terms of power, and that's why we have to be humble.	0
ClaimBuster	131	No, but, John, the fact of the matter is, is that I was opposed to those tax breaks, tried to strip them out.	1
ClaimBuster	132	We learned from their mistakes.	0
ClaimBuster	133	We can't defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million...	1
ClaimBuster	134	How many of you are under managed care plans?	0
ClaimBuster	135	I think the American people are sick and tired of either/or solutions, people being pushed in the corner, polarized to extremes.	0
ClaimBuster	136	Well -- well, I need to speak a moment...	0
ClaimBuster	137	You know, we have five percent of the world's population in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	138	I think that's a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	139	We cannot be satisfied with what we've been doing for the last eight years.	0
ClaimBuster	140	We need to have a modern system to help seniors, and the idea of supporting a federally controlled 132,000-page document bureaucracy as being a compassionate way for seniors, and the only compassionate source of care for seniors is not my vision.	0
ClaimBuster	141	I think the president owes it to family values to show that he values America's families, whether they're people on welfare you're trying to move from welfare to work, the working poor whom I think deserve a tax break to lift them above poverty if they've got a child in the house and working 40 hours a week, working families who deserve a fair tax system and the opportunity for constant retraining; they deserve a strong economy.	0
ClaimBuster	142	I think it's important, since he talked about the Medicare plan, has he been in the United States Senate for 20 years?	1
ClaimBuster	143	I'm the only person here who's ever balanced a government budget and I've presented 12 of them and cut spending repeatedly.	1
ClaimBuster	144	If you're a single mother making $22,000 a year today and you're trying to raise two children, for every additional dollar you earn you pay a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone making $200,000, and that's not right.	1
ClaimBuster	145	They were just waiting to seize the opportunity.	0
ClaimBuster	146	And he just lifted martial law.	1
ClaimBuster	147	And there are elements of my proposal that you just outlined which I won't repeat.	0
ClaimBuster	148	A leader also understands that the United States must be strong to keep the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	149	We have made the Social Security Trust Fund sound.	0
ClaimBuster	150	They've got -- we've got to give them a chance to do their best again.	0
ClaimBuster	151	So you may keep referring to it as a $5 trillion tax cut, but that's not my plan.	1
ClaimBuster	152	The president said that the government can provide the service at lower cost and without a profit.	1
ClaimBuster	153	No, I am not wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	154	And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	155	I -- I served as a missionary for my church.	1
ClaimBuster	156	I mean, we've had years in which the reigning economic ideology has been what's good for Wall Street, but not what's good for Main Street.	0
ClaimBuster	157	In addition, we've brought down inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	158	It really depends upon how our nation conducts itself in foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	159	But we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals.	0
ClaimBuster	160	That's not what you did in that generation.	0
ClaimBuster	161	I think we ought to have character education in our schools.	0
ClaimBuster	162	I think that all new teachers ought to be tested in the subjects that they teach.	0
ClaimBuster	163	But rather than help you, the taxpayer, have lower cost, rather than help seniors have less expensive drugs, the president made it illegal -- illegal -- for Medicare to actually go out and bargain for lower prices.	1
ClaimBuster	164	Republicans talk about it, but we're the first the first administration in anybody's lifetime looking at this program to bring that deficit down four years in a row.	1
ClaimBuster	165	We felt strongly about them, and they did so well by us.	0
ClaimBuster	166	Finally had to come back to school, the chicken lost its feathers.	0
ClaimBuster	167	And he cut defense an extra $60 billion, threw a lot of people out of work.	1
ClaimBuster	168	I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole.	0
ClaimBuster	169	The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against.	1
ClaimBuster	170	The Nicaraguans must know that it is the policy of our government that that leadership must stay behind the boundaries of their nation, not interfere in other nations.	0
ClaimBuster	171	But itÃâ‚¬s not going to be dedicated by some federal bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.	0
ClaimBuster	172	And it seems to me that there is a problem there, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	173	We didn't have the cuts the president promised he'd make and then he doubled.	1
ClaimBuster	174	We do have an obligation, but we can't be all things to all people.	0
ClaimBuster	175	And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on.	0
ClaimBuster	176	George Bush believes in them.	0
ClaimBuster	177	I remember distinctly, I was segueing into another subject.	0
ClaimBuster	178	And I'm saying, where is this?	0
ClaimBuster	179	"I believe that -- I believe they've moved that sign, ""The buck stops here"" from the Oval Office desk to ""The buck stops here"" on the Lincoln bedroom."	0
ClaimBuster	180	And that's what we have to -- I think that's the test of public service.	0
ClaimBuster	181	Every President until this one has been able to do it, and this nation -- or the world is more dangerous as a result.	0
ClaimBuster	182	Americans are angry, they're upset, and they're a little fearful.	0
ClaimBuster	183	Instead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together.	1
ClaimBuster	184	You don't muddle through the central front on terror and you don't muddle through going after bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	185	But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country.	0
ClaimBuster	186	I see a young man who is a knowledgeable-in defense and there are three people on our ticket that are knowledgeable-in the whole-in the race-knowledgeable in defense and Dan Quayle is one of them and I am one of them.	0
ClaimBuster	187	And one of the things that I intend to do as president is to restore America's standing in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	188	Our health-care system is the envy of the world because we believe in making sure that the decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by officials in the nation's capital.	0
ClaimBuster	189	That is not a recipe for making sure that we are taking advantage of the opportunities and meeting the challenges of the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	190	Now, you know, that may not seem like a big deal when it just is, you know, numbers on a sheet of paper, but if we're talking about a family who's got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid, that's a big problem.	0
ClaimBuster	191	I mean that's what, I want to stop it from coming across the border.	0
ClaimBuster	192	I'll never give a veto over American security to any other entity -- not a nation, not a country, not an institution.	0
ClaimBuster	193	And I have made some good sound proposals.	0
ClaimBuster	194	What I think we ought to do is take a look at perestroika and glasnost, welcome them, but keep our eyes open.	0
ClaimBuster	195	But I think it's about his priorities.	0
ClaimBuster	196	Now we have to create those jobs, now that we're requiring people to go do work.	0
ClaimBuster	197	Well, Jim, I want to thank you and thank the folks here at Washington University and the vice president.	0
ClaimBuster	198	I went to a boys' club.	1
ClaimBuster	199	But at some point, we want to do that as well.	0
ClaimBuster	200	I don't want to go back to malaise and misery index.	0
ClaimBuster	201	I think you have to knock out ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	202	I grew up 5 blocks from Arkansas.	1
ClaimBuster	203	And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left.	1
ClaimBuster	204	Yes, let me respond to this.	0
ClaimBuster	205	Do you know today that the Com- the Russians broadcast ten times as many programs in Spanish to Latin America as we do?	1
ClaimBuster	206	me that the Federal grants that come with.	0
ClaimBuster	207	We've got to grow enough to maintain the forces that we have abroad and to wage the non-military battle for the war - uh - for the world in Asia, in Africa and Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	208	He's added more debt to the debt of the United States in four years than all the way from George Washington to Ronald Reagan put together.	1
ClaimBuster	209	It's inconvenient for Senator Dole, but the truth is I've reduced the size of government more than my Republican predecessors.	1
ClaimBuster	210	We've put a cap on the growth of all that spending, and that's good and that's helped.	1
ClaimBuster	211	Well, the Vice President and I came to the Congress together 1946; we both served in the Labor Committee.	1
ClaimBuster	212	We need to invest and save.	0
ClaimBuster	213	The take-home pay of a worker in this country is actually less now than it was in 1968 - measured in real dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	214	But just one point I want to make, Tom.	0
ClaimBuster	215	I don't think that even if that effort fails that it will be necessary to carry on tests in the atmosphere which pollute the atmosphere.	0
ClaimBuster	216	We've got to attack at all points, we've go to use undercover operations.	0
ClaimBuster	217	But let me also point out that to several parliaments around the world, in Europe and in Asia, I have made a statement to each one of them, and I'll repeat it here: A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.	1
ClaimBuster	218	We have a problem with litigation in the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	219	I'd like to respond to that.	0
ClaimBuster	220	He offers retreads of programs that failed.	1
ClaimBuster	221	I'd say around 30 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	222	I think this is a great country, because we've always wanted to do better, to make our country better, to make our lives better.	0
ClaimBuster	223	Do you believe in MAD, mutual assured destruction, mutual deterrence as it has been practiced for the last generation?	0
ClaimBuster	224	That's the way you help people.	0
ClaimBuster	225	A good place to start is to say no managed care provider can gag a doctor and kick the doctor out of the managed care plan for the doctor, telling the patient, you need a more expensive test, you need a more expensive procedure, your health requires it.	0
ClaimBuster	226	I haven't started naming names except for one person, and that's Mr. Richard Cheney who I thought did a great job the other night.	0
ClaimBuster	227	And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks.	1
ClaimBuster	228	... so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	229	Number two, I'll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state.	0
ClaimBuster	230	And that's why I'm trying to do something about it by stimulating the export, vesting more, better education systems.	0
ClaimBuster	231	Congress is hiring people by the droves, and the cast as a result has gone up.	0
ClaimBuster	232	Not working with government alone, but all of us working together.	0
ClaimBuster	233	Number four, if you're under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn't happen before.	1
ClaimBuster	234	So choice and competition amongst schools is one of the key elements that's already been proven in places in like New Orleans and New York City and other places, where we have charter schools, where we take good teachers and we reward them and promote them.	1
ClaimBuster	235	That was my posture as well.	0
ClaimBuster	236	Those are the kinds of choices that the American people face right now.	1
ClaimBuster	237	It's time for the man to leave.	0
ClaimBuster	238	Cutting our investments in research and technology, that's not a smart choice.	0
ClaimBuster	239	And it was always one of the things we argued about with respect to arms control.	0
ClaimBuster	240	We've read their accounts now about what happened.	1
ClaimBuster	241	People can look it up, you're right.	0
ClaimBuster	242	If you've got an employer-based health care plan, you keep it.	0
ClaimBuster	243	Secretary of Defense Robert Gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in Afghanistan and it needs to end there.	1
ClaimBuster	244	He actually got the first question.	1
ClaimBuster	245	If you feel that everything that is being done now is satisfactory, that the relative power and prestige and strength of the United States is increasing in relation to that of the Communists; that we've b- gaining more security, that we are achieving everything as a nation that we should achieve, that we are achieving a better life for our citizens and greater strength, then I agree.	0
ClaimBuster	246	Now that's not reform, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	247	In this Administration we've stopped them at Quemoy and Matsu; we've stopped them in Indochina; we've stopped them in Lebanon; we've stopped them in other parts of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	248	And that's what I intend to do when I'm president.	0
ClaimBuster	249	And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade.	0
ClaimBuster	250	No, I don't think it's OK, and said so publicly.	0
ClaimBuster	251	My state now ranks first in the country in job growth this year, fourth in income growth, fourth in reduction of poverty, third in overall economic performance, according to a major news magazine.	1
ClaimBuster	252	He is right that I'm not in favor of energy taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	253	You see, I do believe that some crimes are so heinous, so brutal, so outrageous, and I'd say particularly those that result in the death of a police officer, for those real brutal crimes, I do believe in the death penalty, and I think it is a deterrent, and I believe we need it.	0
ClaimBuster	254	Uh - we've always had, I think, a lot of constitutional amendments proposed, but the passage of them has been uh - fairly slow, and uh - few and far between.	0
ClaimBuster	255	It ought to be tried.	0
ClaimBuster	256	We have to be prepared to use military force against terrorist base camps, we have to work closely with our allies to make sure that they're working with us and we with them and we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back of international terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	257	They have to pay up.	0
ClaimBuster	258	I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other.	0
ClaimBuster	259	The issue is what you do about it.	0
ClaimBuster	260	We ought to keep making those extra effort Affirmative Action programs, the law and the policy of the land.	0
ClaimBuster	261	If that were true, why didn't we identify ourselves with the people of Africa?	0
ClaimBuster	262	The degree of unpopularity of a regime when the choice is total authoritarianism totalitarianism, I should say, in the alternative government, makes one wonder whether you are being helpful to the people.	0
ClaimBuster	263	And we knew the limits on their nuclear power.	0
ClaimBuster	264	I've lived the American dream; I'd like for your children to be able to live it, too.	0
ClaimBuster	265	That's exactly what we're doing.	0
ClaimBuster	266	And that's why I have made it a number one priority in my budget, not a tax cut for the wealthy.	1
ClaimBuster	267	I know all about poverty and all about need and all about taking care of people, and that's been my career in the United States Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	268	As for offshore oiling, only 2% now is so leased and is producing oil.	1
ClaimBuster	269	Why would you want to do that, anyone, anyone in America, when we have such a tough time, when these small business people, like Joe the plumber, are going to create jobs, unless you take that money from him and spread the wealth around.	0
ClaimBuster	270	I can bring them in that direction by eliminating spending.	0
ClaimBuster	271	And I've covered it again and again in print and on television.	1
ClaimBuster	272	One, he clearly has a litmus test for his judges, which I disagree with.	1
ClaimBuster	273	It will require the ability of a Republican president to reach out across the partisan divide and to say to Democrats, let's come together to do what is right for America.	0
ClaimBuster	274	Tell you what I hear.	0
ClaimBuster	275	Now, if that quote was wrong, he can repudiate it, right here.	0
ClaimBuster	276	On the tax cut, it's a big decision.	0
ClaimBuster	277	I remember the floods that swept our state.	0
ClaimBuster	278	But I'll tell you this, as president, if it took American forces to some degree to coalesce the African Union, I'd be prepared to do it because we could never allow another Rwanda.	0
ClaimBuster	279	I think we ought to focus on the problems and not attack each other.	0
ClaimBuster	280	George McGovern is a friend of mine, so I don't mean, but he was a liberal, proud liberal.	1
ClaimBuster	281	The American people should make up their own mind.	0
ClaimBuster	282	I did not say that.	1
ClaimBuster	283	And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked.	1
ClaimBuster	284	There are 200,000 people in California, for example, who have lost their defense related jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	285	Well, we may not be there yet but we're not going to get there by giving preferences and quotas.	0
ClaimBuster	286	Who has the integrity and stability to get the job done?Ã¢â€°Â¤ My fellow Americans, I am that man and I ask for your support.	0
ClaimBuster	287	It will remain strong, so long as I'm the president.	0
ClaimBuster	288	A few months later, he said he wanted to cut the defense budget by eight or nine billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	289	And so I have just negotiated with the president of Mexico the North American Free Trade Agreement -- and the prime minister of Canada, I might add -- and I want to have more of these free trade agreements, because export jobs are increasing far faster than any jobs that may have moved overseas.	1
ClaimBuster	290	We've upheld the doctrine that said if you harbor a terrorist, you're equally as guilty as the terrorist.	1
ClaimBuster	291	Well, we're $4 trillion in debt.	1
ClaimBuster	292	And 3 days after the election in 1982, they came to us and said, Social Security, we know, is broke.	1
ClaimBuster	293	We passed the bill in the Senate this year but it didn't pass the House.	1
ClaimBuster	294	I will work with Republicans and Democrats.	0
ClaimBuster	295	Bio-degradable plastics-plastic-gasohol, which the Vice President has been involved in, road de-icers made from corn products.	1
ClaimBuster	296	Now, when you look at what Germany pays for money and what we don't pay for money, you realize there's quite a spread, right, and you realize this is a temporary thing and there's going to be another sucking sound that runs our deficit through the roof.	0
ClaimBuster	297	I have never said I would liquidate...	1
ClaimBuster	298	"The real mistake was the ""read my lips"" promise in the first place."	0
ClaimBuster	299	I think that it's important for judges to understand that if a woman is out there trying to raise a family, trying to support her family, and is being treated unfairly, then the court has to stand up, if nobody else will.	0
ClaimBuster	300	The real problem in this country is that most people are working hard and falling farther behind.	0
ClaimBuster	301	And I'm going to put in place a better homeland security effort.	0
ClaimBuster	302	You know, the president's father did not go into Iraq, into Baghdad, beyond Basra.	1
ClaimBuster	303	And it wasn't me that let the polluters actually come into the halls of Congress, into the rooms, and rewrite the environmental laws.	1
ClaimBuster	304	But I'll never fail to protect the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	305	There's now a general strike going on.	1
ClaimBuster	306	In my judgment, a vigorous Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in the House and Senate can win the support for these programs.	0
ClaimBuster	307	Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it.	1
ClaimBuster	308	And I'm very, very proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	309	The same is true of highways.	1
ClaimBuster	310	I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	311	Giving aid to schools technically that are trying to carry out the decision is not the great question.	0
ClaimBuster	312	Secondly, if it is correct, have you informed yourself in the meantime?	0
ClaimBuster	313	We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.	0
ClaimBuster	314	But -- but what it did do is to -- if you extrapolated how much money we're talking about, you'd look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	315	I happen to like President Clinton personally.	0
ClaimBuster	316	We had some fun Crystal Gayle and Loretta Lynn with us, and they got up and sang, went to little towns and I talked agriculture.	1
ClaimBuster	317	I don't blame them entirely for it.	0
ClaimBuster	318	And we have a winning fight.	0
ClaimBuster	319	And if such a defense could be found, wouldn't it be far more humanitarian to say that now we can defend against a nuclear war by destroying missiles instead of slaughtering millions of people?	0
ClaimBuster	320	Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.	1
ClaimBuster	321	First we have to understand that SALT I expires October third 1977.	1
ClaimBuster	322	They're reliable friends in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	323	And it's time we take a look at the pay scales.	0
ClaimBuster	324	First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing.	0
ClaimBuster	325	I had the chance to be governor of a state.	1
ClaimBuster	326	I've got a policy for the future and agenda for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	327	I voted for Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg.	1
ClaimBuster	328	When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper-income individuals can -- are currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you don't come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending.	1
ClaimBuster	329	Tell him you can have everything you got.	0
ClaimBuster	330	My opponent, the senator, talks about foreign policy.	1
ClaimBuster	331	What we've said is to states, we'll give you more money if you initiate reforms.	1
ClaimBuster	332	I will try to do the same thing.	0
ClaimBuster	333	The United States must maintain a defense capability of the Panama Canal.	0
ClaimBuster	334	And that's going to require effort from each and every one of us.	0
ClaimBuster	335	Laura and I are proud parents of teenage girls, twin daughters, and I know what you're saying.	1
ClaimBuster	336	Admiral Mullen suggests that Senator Obama's plan is dangerous for America.	1
ClaimBuster	337	That was a great -- I thought a great display of presidential leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	338	But I do know that, despite his pledge to reduce state Government spending, that it rose from $4.6 billion when he took office in 1967, to $10.2 billion during his eight years in office.	1
ClaimBuster	339	But being as they have not yet been willing to recognize Kostunica as the lawful winner of the election, I'm not sure it's right for us to invite the president of Russia to mediate this -- this dispute there because we might not like the results that comes out of that.	1
ClaimBuster	340	That starts putting the squeeze on them.	0
ClaimBuster	341	And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.	0
ClaimBuster	342	And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected?	1
ClaimBuster	343	And so the question now is how do we build on those strengths.	0
ClaimBuster	344	I mean, he can throw out all kinds -- I don't know the particulars of this law.	0
ClaimBuster	345	... get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I'm sorry, you've got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma...	0
ClaimBuster	346	Now, under Senator McCain's plan there is a strong risk that people would lose their employer-based health care.	1
ClaimBuster	347	And I do think that there's constructive work being done out there.	0
ClaimBuster	348	"I was a little disappointed in Magic because he came to me and I said, ""Now if you see something we're not doing, get ahold of me."	0
ClaimBuster	349	We uh - have got to do that at the federal government level.	0
ClaimBuster	350	I have so many things there to respond to, I'm going to pick out something you said earlier.	0
ClaimBuster	351	We're going to have a hard time rebuilding it.	0
ClaimBuster	352	It also requires something that Governor Bush's plan doesn't.	0
ClaimBuster	353	You're seeing it right now in the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	354	Our people are out of work, and there's a sense of withdrawal.	0
ClaimBuster	355	And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice.	0
ClaimBuster	356	Number two, we're going to have to stop illegal immigration.	0
ClaimBuster	357	They're not as stupid as Washington thinks they are.	0
ClaimBuster	358	And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.	0
ClaimBuster	359	I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.	0
ClaimBuster	360	And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.	0
ClaimBuster	361	I've got a lot of experience in not taking 10 years to solve a 10-minute problem.	0
ClaimBuster	362	He didn't do all these things.	1
ClaimBuster	363	"It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid so people at the lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then it also - I do not want to see us mandate across the board that every company has to do this, because I really think that marginal operators are going to go say, ""We can't make it."""	0
ClaimBuster	364	I believe that our future as a nation depends upon whether or not we can break down these barriers that have been used to pit group against group, and bring our people together.	0
ClaimBuster	365	I know what strong political leadership is.	0
ClaimBuster	366	And, by the way, our beloved Nancy Reagan is in the hospital tonight, so our thoughts and prayers are going with you.	1
ClaimBuster	367	They were counterfeit products being made overseas with the same serial number as a U.S. company, the same packaging, these were being sold into our market and around the world as if they were made by the U.S. competitor.	1
ClaimBuster	368	Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours?	0
ClaimBuster	369	But I believe the effort should be made once more by who's ever elected president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	370	I'm going to be running an ad pretty soon that shows they promised us they were going to hold the line on spending at the tax and budget summit, and I'm going to show how much they've increased this little stuff they do for themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	371	He has asked for $932 million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that he's been in the United States Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	372	Come on, give me five.	0
ClaimBuster	373	and that's simply why I proposed, 15 months ago, the emergency excise tax on gasoline that I did.	1
ClaimBuster	374	So I'm not going to begin, and I'm not going to go to entitlements as a means for cutting that deficit when we're spending billions on something like Star Wars, when we're spending billions on other weapon systems which apparently the Vice President wants to keep in his back pocket or some place, but which, if we continue to spend billions on them, will force us to cut Social Security, to cut Medicare, to cut these basic entitlements to people of very, very modest means.	0
ClaimBuster	375	In Puerto Rico this year, I met with six of the leading industrial nations' heads of state to meet the problem of inflation so we would be able to solve it before it got out of hand.	1
ClaimBuster	376	and must do what he's talking about now.	0
ClaimBuster	377	Five hundred thousand kids lost after-school programs because of your budget.	1
ClaimBuster	378	And I believe it incumbent upon us now to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	379	I believe that this president, regrettably, rushed us into a war, made decisions about foreign policy, pushed alliances away.	0
ClaimBuster	380	That's the strategy you need, an all-of-the-above strategy, and that's what we're going to do in the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	381	"And on the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting the ""Celebrity Apprentice."""	1
ClaimBuster	382	It is also used to give your mothers and fathers the Social Security checks that they live on.	1
ClaimBuster	383	There's a difference in my opinion - uh and in accordance with the ruling of the Supreme Court and accordance with the definition in the dictionary.	0
ClaimBuster	384	It's a different world now.	0
ClaimBuster	385	We didn't guard 850,000 tons of ammo.	1
ClaimBuster	386	That's what I hope to get to talk about tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	387	The U-2 flights were proper from the point of view of protecting our security.	0
ClaimBuster	388	We're the great nation that has allies, 42 allies and friends around the world.	1
ClaimBuster	389	Is it President Obama's fault?	0
ClaimBuster	390	And there are more, if you want to talk about percentage appointments, more Members of Congress who have been under investigation percentage-wise that people in the executive branch.	1
ClaimBuster	391	We told him that we wouldn't get involved with his border dispute, and we've never revealed those papers that were given to Ambassador Glaspie on July the 25th.	1
ClaimBuster	392	Our tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery.	0
ClaimBuster	393	I understand that Governor Carter, when he was Governor of Georgia, vetoed between thirty-five and forty bills a year.	1
ClaimBuster	394	We're going to go through a period of shared sacrifice.	0
ClaimBuster	395	But they were all totally -- it was all fiction.	1
ClaimBuster	396	But I know this, that President Kennedy in his inaugural address told all of us that here on Earth, God's work must truly be our own.	1
ClaimBuster	397	In addition to that, I believe we have a crisis here at home, a crisis of the middle class that is increasingly squeezed, health-care costs going up.	1
ClaimBuster	398	What I've had as a basic commitment since I've been President is to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.	1
ClaimBuster	399	And you cannot fight a victory for Communism or a strategy of victory for Communism with the strategy, simply of holding the line.	0
ClaimBuster	400	And we'll continue to spread freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	401	So, it is good fo the American people to remember that there is a sharp basic historical difference between Governor Reagan and me on these crucial issues - also, between the two parties that we represent.	0
ClaimBuster	402	Employers of under 50 are exempted.	1
ClaimBuster	403	The earthquake and the hurricanes, it has devastated Haiti.	1
ClaimBuster	404	What I'd also like to point out the Iranians are putting the most lethal IEDs into Iraq which are killing young Americans, there are special groups in Iran coming into Iraq and are being trained in Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	405	That's why the Patriot Act was important.	0
ClaimBuster	406	Sometimes my advice has been taken.	0
ClaimBuster	407	The point is that throughout history, whether it be Ronald Reagan, who wouldn't sit down with Brezhnev, Andropov or Chernenko until Gorbachev was ready with glasnost and perestroika.	1
ClaimBuster	408	The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	409	I think a lot of it uh - depends on current events - uh - sometimes foreign affairs, sometimes domestic affairs.	0
ClaimBuster	410	Maybe he'll tell us where he stand on it tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	411	By the way, the average policy costs about $12,000.	1
ClaimBuster	412	I just want to make -- foreign lobbyists, this whole thing.	0
ClaimBuster	413	I think what we have to do, however, is have the president and the leadership set before our country exactly what we must do in the next decade, if we're going to maintain our security in education, in economic growth, in development of natural resources.	0
ClaimBuster	414	I think, joining with our allies and friends in a league of democracies, that we can effectively abridge their behavior, and hopefully they would abandon this quest that they are on for nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	415	In the cabinet I have one of the outstanding, I think, administrators as the secretary of transportation, Bill Coleman.	0
ClaimBuster	416	I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation.	0
ClaimBuster	417	You know, the American people are fair.	0
ClaimBuster	418	Che Guevara was a contemptible figure in civilization's history.	0
ClaimBuster	419	You've got to read what he said.	0
ClaimBuster	420	perhaps, some special interest groups who are tied closely to government.	0
ClaimBuster	421	I said in my acceptance speech in San Diego about two months ago that the exits are clearly marked.	1
ClaimBuster	422	You see, there has to be a consequence.	0
ClaimBuster	423	And I didn't even apologize to my wife, who's sitting right here, because I didn't do anything.	1
ClaimBuster	424	The reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the President was against them; it was because the people were against them.	0
ClaimBuster	425	Another thing that concerned me was what Mr. Ford said about unemployment, that - insinuating that under Johnson and Kennedy that unemployment could only be held down when this country is at war.	1
ClaimBuster	426	I have never promised more than I could produce and I have produced everything that I promised.	0
ClaimBuster	427	That was one of the worst things that's ever been signed by our country.	0
ClaimBuster	428	He also said in December of 2003 that anyone who doubts that the world is safer without Saddam Hussein does not have the judgment to be president.	1
ClaimBuster	429	This has been their primary focus.	1
ClaimBuster	430	Now, if you're willing to join us in getting rid of all the nuclear weapons in the world, then we'll give you this one, so that we would both know that no one can cheat; that we're both got something that if anyone tries to cheat .	0
ClaimBuster	431	I became president at the time that the United States was in a very troubled time.	0
ClaimBuster	432	The treaty does not include these two islands.	1
ClaimBuster	433	This has expressed itself in the revolts in Eastern Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	434	That uh - situation called for me to first put the United States on a steady course and to keep our keel well balanced, because we had to face the difficult problems that had all of a sudden hit America.	0
ClaimBuster	435	And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops.	1
ClaimBuster	436	For those of you for my opponent, please only vote once.	0
ClaimBuster	437	I heard Gov Clinton congratulate us on 1 thing -- first time he said something pleasant about this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	438	I think the most important thing to emphasize, though, is that we also have to help people in other ways to build a strong economy and we can't have any tax cut that's not paid for.	0
ClaimBuster	439	The fact that the faith speaks to us and that we are moral people, hopefully, I accept and rejoice in.	0
ClaimBuster	440	And if we can't love one another, we ought to get along with one another.	0
ClaimBuster	441	Values begin at the top, in the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	442	Let's look at the other side of the coin.	0
ClaimBuster	443	I just love the fact that everybody, particularly in the media, goes bonkers over the town hall.	0
ClaimBuster	444	Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission.	1
ClaimBuster	445	We need to deny them the recruits.	0
ClaimBuster	446	I am suggesting that there are literally thousands of unnecessary regulations that invade every facet of business, and indeed, very much of our personal lives, that are unnecessary; that Government can do without; that have added $130 billion to the cost of production in this country; and that are contributing their part to inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	447	If we are strong, particularly as we face a crisis over Berlin - which we may in the spring, or in the winter - it's important that we maintain our determination here; that we indicate that we're building our strength; that we are determined to protect our position; that we're determined to protect our commitment.	0
ClaimBuster	448	This is a peaceful nation, and I intend to keep the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	449	One thing to blame is these malpractice lawsuits.	0
ClaimBuster	450	All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run.	0
ClaimBuster	451	When Governor Romney says that we should eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, there are millions of women all across the country, who rely on Planned Parenthood for, not just contraceptive care, they rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings.	1
ClaimBuster	452	You want to have a new program in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	453	People who pay taxes will get tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	454	We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them.	0
ClaimBuster	455	So that I believe that on this subject we can balance the budget unless we have a national emergency or unless we have a severe recession.	0
ClaimBuster	456	Every other ad -- ever other ad was an attack ad on my health care plan.	1
ClaimBuster	457	This issue has been too long on the table because it's been a political issue.	1
ClaimBuster	458	So first it will be Quemoy and Matsu, next it may be Formosa.	0
ClaimBuster	459	Mr. Carter has indicated he would look with sympathy to a Communist government in NATO.	1
ClaimBuster	460	I just believe it's time to change.	0
ClaimBuster	461	Because if you bring rates down, it makes it easier for small business to keep more of their capital and hire people.	1
ClaimBuster	462	I don't stand on it because it isn't something to stand on but something to build on.	0
ClaimBuster	463	It should have never happened.	0
ClaimBuster	464	In terms of vetoing tax bills, you're darn right.	0
ClaimBuster	465	Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement.	0
ClaimBuster	466	But they're not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like Medicaid.	0
ClaimBuster	467	I want to think that they're going to be able to afford an education.	0
ClaimBuster	468	And over a longer period of time, let the federal government begin to absorb part of it that's now paid by the state governments.	0
ClaimBuster	469	We're going to see that it doesn't.	0
ClaimBuster	470	And so it's important to understand that the -- I think the American people are hungry for the kind of leadership that is going to tackle these problems not just in government, but outside of government.	0
ClaimBuster	471	I believe that this party - Republican party - has stood still really for twenty-five years - its leadership has.	0
ClaimBuster	472	Now there are some places where I think -- you know, I've supported the administration in Columbia.	0
ClaimBuster	473	We did not go as a last resort.	0
ClaimBuster	474	Nobody knows who hired this man.	1
ClaimBuster	475	Well, I don't have any idea but I hope it will happen some time in my lifetime.	0
ClaimBuster	476	I resent it because th- it's an implication that Republicans have been trigger-happy and, therefore, would lead this nation into war.	0
ClaimBuster	477	I'm Chairman of the President's Task Force on Regulatory Relief and we are working with the FDA and they have sped up bringing drugs to market that can help.	1
ClaimBuster	478	I want to say something, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	479	Show me one accomplishment toward Medicare that he accomplished.	0
ClaimBuster	480	He can provide an injunction if there's a national emergency for eighty days, then the strike can go on; and there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he went to the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	481	Medical liability issues are a problem, a significant problem.	1
ClaimBuster	482	Doctors are giving prescriptions, they're recommending treatments, and then their recommendations are being overruled by HMOs and insurance companies.	1
ClaimBuster	483	Secondly, of course we've been involved with Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	484	We cannot, of course, control the Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	485	But there's no doubt there's a lot of opposition to it in the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	486	And I think maybe we could look back over our shoulders and wonder whether it was right to let all those mental patients out.	0
ClaimBuster	487	I don't like that idea.	0
ClaimBuster	488	In countries like Libya or Iraq, we have even alienated some of our closest trade partners because we have insisted upon the control of the spread of nuclear weapons to those potentially terrorist countries.	1
ClaimBuster	489	Those who can afford to have them will continue to have them.	0
ClaimBuster	490	But the first -- pardon me -- the first time we went in, we went in at their request because the war was going on right in Beirut between Israel and the PLO terrorists.	1
ClaimBuster	491	And she can say all she wants about college tuition.	0
ClaimBuster	492	On jobs -- that's the number one priority, and I believe my program for stimulating investment, encouraging small business, brand-new approach to education, strengthening the American family, and, yes, creating more exports is the way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	493	We added 1.9 million new jobs over the last 13 months.	1
ClaimBuster	494	Do you realize, 900,000 small businesses will be taxed under his plan because most small businesses are Subchapter S corps or limited partnerships, and they pay tax at the individual income tax level.	1
ClaimBuster	495	Now I believe there's a better way to do this.	0
ClaimBuster	496	Our government shouldn't have allowed that to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	497	And whenever the uh - automobile manufacturers come forward and say they can't meet the uh - amendments that the Congress has put forward, this Republican administration has delayed the implementation dates.	1
ClaimBuster	498	Now, the problem is that they didn't think these things through properly.	1
ClaimBuster	499	And - and that's a reversal of position uh by the Burger Court with which I do agree.	1
ClaimBuster	500	I think you ought to have at least one answer to it.	0
ClaimBuster	501	Number 2, if you don't rebuild the economic strength of this country at home, we won't be a superpower.	0
ClaimBuster	502	What message does that send the Iraqis?	0
ClaimBuster	503	This strategy requires additional troops, it requires a fundamental change in strategy and I fought for it.	1
ClaimBuster	504	You have to work on this day in and day out, every month ,every year, every issue, to make sure that we have not only free trade but fair trade.	0
ClaimBuster	505	He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them.	1
ClaimBuster	506	You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit.	0
ClaimBuster	507	You know, the President reminds me sometimes of my brother Kenny, who is no longer alive.	1
ClaimBuster	508	These uh - kinds of specific things, uh none of which are being done now, would be a great help in - in reducing uh unemployment.	0
ClaimBuster	509	Because of the president's decision today, law enforcement officers will walk into a place that will be more dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	510	And you pick out 20,000, whether they need the money or not, and they get paid for volunteering.	1
ClaimBuster	511	How much did you cut them by, then?	0
ClaimBuster	512	In fact, it doesn't ask you to do anything -- if you don't want to take it, you don't have to.	0
ClaimBuster	513	And we've got to -- to make sure that we have people who are trained interrogators so that we don't ever torture a prisoner ever again.	0
ClaimBuster	514	China is now the largest manufacturer in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	515	So you have to temper your decisions with the ability to beneficially affect the situation and realize you're sending America's most precious asset, American blood, into harm's way.	0
ClaimBuster	516	They don't want this arms race.	0
ClaimBuster	517	The President says that when the Democratic Party made its turn, he left it.	1
ClaimBuster	518	We need to encourage programs such as Teach for America and Troops to Teachers where people, after having served in the military, can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which -- or have the certification that some are required in some states.	0
ClaimBuster	519	There are more deductions in the tax code for shutting plants down and moving overseas than there are for modernizing plant and equipment here.	1
ClaimBuster	520	We are asking for men and women to join the military as a career, and we're asking them to deal with the most sophisticated of equipment.	0
ClaimBuster	521	Well, people got their checks, and they'll continue to get their checks.	1
ClaimBuster	522	They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through.	0
ClaimBuster	523	That's using a hatchet to cut the federal budget.	0
ClaimBuster	524	The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations who don't presently have it, particularly terrorist nations.	0
ClaimBuster	525	And that meant I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done.	0
ClaimBuster	526	More than half of these 10 and a half million new jobs are in higher wage areas and we'll have more manufacturing and sales around the world.	1
ClaimBuster	527	Builders and community leaders are ready.	0
ClaimBuster	528	I happen to like the idea of having technology for the TV, easy for parents to use so you can tune out these programs you don't want in your house.	0
ClaimBuster	529	And there are some parts of Dodd-Frank that make all the sense in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	530	Uh - I obviously don't think it's valid.	0
ClaimBuster	531	His top adviser on immigration is the guy who designed the Arizona law, the entirety of it; not E-Verify, the whole thing.	1
ClaimBuster	532	So, why should we believe that they had placed that much more reliance on land-based?	0
ClaimBuster	533	The ability to fight, if necessary, is the best way to avoid the chance for, or the requirement to fight.	0
ClaimBuster	534	If I wanted to do that, why would I run for president, Jim?	0
ClaimBuster	535	Look at the votes in the United Nations over the past seven and a half years.	0
ClaimBuster	536	And, of course, as far as the how we make it better, yes, we can do better on interdiction.	0
ClaimBuster	537	Well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	538	In a recent 30-day period, 37 terrorist acts in 20 countries have been committed.	1
ClaimBuster	539	This is what Ross Perot complains about.	0
ClaimBuster	540	But I would propose holding that income up not through a type of program that Senator Kennedy has suggested that would raise prices, but one that would indemnify the farmer, pay the farmer in kind uh - from the products which are in surplus.	0
ClaimBuster	541	And, again, I know those situations.	0
ClaimBuster	542	The history in Colombia right now is that labor leaders have been targeted for assassination on a fairly consistent basis and there have not been prosecutions.	1
ClaimBuster	543	I want to answer your question, but let me say one other thing.	0
ClaimBuster	544	And I hope we can do better.	0
ClaimBuster	545	I believe that we should not compare what our figures may be to India or some other country that has serious problems but to remember that we are the most prosperous country in the world and that these people are not getting adequate food.	1
ClaimBuster	546	It's supposed to come from the people, it comes at the people.	0
ClaimBuster	547	If our view prevails that we have to do more, that we have to make a greater national and international effort, that we have lost prestige in Latin America - the President of Brazil - the new incumbent running for office called on Castro during his campaign because he thought it was important to get the vote of those who were supporting Castro in Latin America.	1
ClaimBuster	548	We are the greatest country on the face of the earth.	0
ClaimBuster	549	We know how to set agendas.	0
ClaimBuster	550	I hope you will look at the ideas in it.	0
ClaimBuster	551	Thank you to Hofstra University and to Candy Crowley for organizing and leading this -- this event.	0
ClaimBuster	552	It's a question of who they are.	0
ClaimBuster	553	Let's look at the facts.	0
ClaimBuster	554	See, for 45 years we were preoccupied with the Red Army.	1
ClaimBuster	555	And, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and we've got to keep fighting, and I will defeat ISIS, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	556	Seven administrations were dealing with Mr. Noriega.	1
ClaimBuster	557	We've had millions of young men and women in subsequent subsequent wars change the face of the nation because the government helped with their education.	0
ClaimBuster	558	Less than a hundred people have been working throughout the entire federal government on this subject, and I believe it's been reflected in our success and failures at Geneva.	1
ClaimBuster	559	And that's why we're doing what we're doing.	0
ClaimBuster	560	If it's good enough for us, it's good enough for every American.	0
ClaimBuster	561	Can I make another point?	0
ClaimBuster	562	You're putting a lot of business people out of business.	0
ClaimBuster	563	It's illegal right now and has been for years for illegal immigrants to get welfare benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	564	So it sounds great, but our targeted tax cut for education, child rearing, healthcare and home buying, which is paid for in my balanced budget plan, something that he has not done, certified by the Congressional budget office, that's the right way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	565	Now, I've identified areas where we can, right away, make a change that I believe would actually help the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	566	We've got to change the system.	0
ClaimBuster	567	Jim, I had the great experience -- it didn't seem like it at the time -- of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat.	1
ClaimBuster	568	We have concluded with Japan 21 -- about to be 22 -- trade agreements now.	1
ClaimBuster	569	Now right here in Arizona, that difference would have been $131 million to the state of Arizona to help its kids be able to have better education and to lift the property tax burden from its citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	570	If you didn't balance your budget, you went out of business.	0
ClaimBuster	571	He chose a tax cut for wealthy Americans over the things that I listed to you.	0
ClaimBuster	572	Well, Jim, I think every American in any position of responsibility should be concerned about what's happened.	0
ClaimBuster	573	We've got 1,000 extra border patrol on the southern border; want 1,000 on the northern border.	1
ClaimBuster	574	If we're going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be done at the local level or the state level.	0
ClaimBuster	575	I want to take very dollar by which we reduce defense and reinvest it in technologies for the 21st century--in new transportation, in communication, in environmental clean-up technologies.	0
ClaimBuster	576	When you don't have any ideas, you don't have any agenda, and all you have is fear, that's all you can use.	0
ClaimBuster	577	You can look at the record.	0
ClaimBuster	578	And for me, this is about jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	579	And, by the way, she also understands special-needs families.	0
ClaimBuster	580	We're seeing Iraq united as Iraqis, tough, hard, but we're seeing them.	0
ClaimBuster	581	But I think it's time to talk about the future.	0
ClaimBuster	582	... $4 billion tax benefit for your family.	1
ClaimBuster	583	I know what it takes to make sure that you have the kind of opportunity you deserve.	0
ClaimBuster	584	We have restored much of our economy.	1
ClaimBuster	585	He's already got $3 trillion, according to The Washington Post, of expenses that he's put on the line from his convention and the promises of this campaign, none of which are paid for.	1
ClaimBuster	586	We had a recession in fifty-four.	1
ClaimBuster	587	We can't stand pat because it is essential with the conflict that we have around the world that we not just hold our own, that we not keep just freedom for ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	588	The best way to defeat them is to never waver, to be strong, to use every asset at our disposal, is to constantly stay on the offensive and, at the same time, spread liberty.	0
ClaimBuster	589	I am trying to provide leadership now, before the election, so that the American people can participate in that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	590	Now, I voted for the Patriot Act.	1
ClaimBuster	591	Why aren't you putting some money in?	0
ClaimBuster	592	"And when Governor Romney says, the challenge is, ""Well Obama didn't try."""	0
ClaimBuster	593	But under our constitution, if you show up tomorrow and obey the law, and you work hard and you do what you're supposed to do, you are entitled to equal treatment.	0
ClaimBuster	594	And, look, this hasn't been an easy decision for me to meet.	0
ClaimBuster	595	It's obvious that we still have a long way to go in fully incorporating the minority groups into the mainstream of American life.	0
ClaimBuster	596	But I must tell you, I think legalization of narcotics, or something of that nature, in the face of the medical evidence, would be totally counterproductive.	0
ClaimBuster	597	Ten million people have registered to vote in Afghanistan in the upcoming presidential election.	1
ClaimBuster	598	And I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life.	1
ClaimBuster	599	And Republicans and Democrats both love America.	0
ClaimBuster	600	But if those Mom and Pop stores all get together and pool, they too can bring the cost of insurance down.	1
ClaimBuster	601	And those grants which make it possible for states and local communities to clean up rivers and harbors and streams.	0
ClaimBuster	602	And as governor of my state, I was able to get 100 percent of my people insured, all my kids, about 98 percent of the adults.	1
ClaimBuster	603	Also I got a philosophical difference.	0
ClaimBuster	604	I proposed a plan, detailed budget, that shows us cutting the deficit in half by five years.	1
ClaimBuster	605	So that pledge isn't realistic, and I think the vice president knows it; I think the people of this country know it.	0
ClaimBuster	606	It's hard work to go from a place where people get their hands cut off, or executed, to a place where people are free.	0
ClaimBuster	607	They've held a torch for the world to see -- the torch of freedom and hope and opportunity.	0
ClaimBuster	608	This is the major recommendation that he's made.	1
ClaimBuster	609	It's to make sure our troops are well-housed and well-equipped.	0
ClaimBuster	610	That's why I'm for Stealth technology, to build a Stealth bomber -- which I've supported for years -- that can penetrate the Soviet air defense system without any hope that they can perceive where it is because their radar system is frustrated.	0
ClaimBuster	611	Whether it be fighting for an HMO patient's bill of rights.	0
ClaimBuster	612	One of the things the next president must do is to remind people that if we are going to have a responsible period in America, that each of us must love our children with all our heart and all our soul.	0
ClaimBuster	613	You pay $500 for a $5 hammer, you're not buying strength.	0
ClaimBuster	614	To go back to the very, very first question.	0
ClaimBuster	615	Bill of Rights - the fact that, by serving in the military, they could provide for a future college education.	1
ClaimBuster	616	Modernize our schools, reduce class size, recruit new teachers, give every child a chance to learn with one-on-one time in a quality -- high-quality, safe school.	0
ClaimBuster	617	And I do favor the death penalty.	0
ClaimBuster	618	They're having to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments.	0
ClaimBuster	619	I picked Lloyd Bentsen, because I thought he was the best qualified person for the job.	0
ClaimBuster	620	And you have 30-some in your administration, either left or being investigated or in jail or whatever, then you've got an ethical problem.	1
ClaimBuster	621	We're going to work with your employer to lower the cost of your premiums by up to $2,500 a year.	0
ClaimBuster	622	Uh - I have uh - added in the current year budget the funds for the National Park Service.	1
ClaimBuster	623	So we can do a better job of homeland security.	0
ClaimBuster	624	I was the first United States president to visit Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	625	We have to tell the truth.	0
ClaimBuster	626	We had a war when we came into power in 1953.	1
ClaimBuster	627	By Russia or anybody else.	0
ClaimBuster	628	More in September than in August.	1
ClaimBuster	629	I didn't do the most or run the greatest risk by a long shot, but I learned what it was like to be an enlisted man in the United States Army.	1
ClaimBuster	630	Dick Cheney's counted as a small business.	1
ClaimBuster	631	If we're lucky and we do it right, that could potentially happen but in the short term there's an outlay and we may not see that money for a while.	0
ClaimBuster	632	And they're going now because of the policies of this administration.	0
ClaimBuster	633	But I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	634	You're familiar, I'm sure, with the recognition given in the Air Force to uh - General James, and there was just uh - approved a three-star admiral, the first in the history of the United States Navy, so uh - we are giving full recognition to individuals of quality in the Ford administration in positions of great responsibility.	1
ClaimBuster	635	But the point is, also, on oil drilling, oil drilling offshore now is vital so that we can bridge the gap.	0
ClaimBuster	636	Believed it in 1998 when Clinton was president.	0
ClaimBuster	637	And perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our times is what do we do about these enormous deficits.	0
ClaimBuster	638	I say -- I was joking with a veteran -- I hate to even go into this.	0
ClaimBuster	639	And I believe strongly that we should have nominees to the United States Supreme Court based on their qualifications rather than any litmus test.	0
ClaimBuster	640	This is the first time that I've - remember in the history of our country when we've let a foreign country circumvent or change our Bill of Rights.	1
ClaimBuster	641	And when John talks about his non-inflationary plan, as far as I have been able to learn, there are 88 proposals in it that call for additional Government spending programs.	1
ClaimBuster	642	And it is a fact in the August session that the four members of the Rules Committee who were Republicans joining with two Democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the House.	1
ClaimBuster	643	And they are being slaughtered...	1
ClaimBuster	644	But it's also put an enormous strain on our budget.	1
ClaimBuster	645	You told him you wanted to spread the wealth around.	1
ClaimBuster	646	I'm not going to go down there and try to dump the sludge from Massachusetts off the beaches off of New Jersey.	0
ClaimBuster	647	We ask the people that are viewing tonight, are you better off than you were four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	648	Please, join me in this cause to move confidently and with a sense of assurance and command to build the blessed future of our nation.	0
ClaimBuster	649	I've negotiated at Vladivostok with uh - Mr. Brezhnev a limitation on the MIRVing of their ballistic missiles at a figure of thirteen-twenty, which is the first time that any president has achieved a cap either on launchers or on MIRVs.	1
ClaimBuster	650	And give it to the president, and if the Congress isn't big enough to do it, let the president have a shot at this excess spending.	0
ClaimBuster	651	We simply cannot ignore the fact that, in those cities today, we have 55% youth unemployment among black and Hispanic youth.	1
ClaimBuster	652	That gap is going to close, because the Arabs, the Japanese and folks in this country are going to start buying German treasuries because they can get more money.	0
ClaimBuster	653	That's going to be critical.	0
ClaimBuster	654	We always had to reform it over the years, but we need somebody who believes it in to reform it.	0
ClaimBuster	655	In the meantime, there has developed the problem of the Soviet Backfire - their high-performance aircraft which they say is not a long-range aircraft and which some of our people say is a intercontinental aircraft.	1
ClaimBuster	656	Thank God I was up in the with Jimmy Baker camping out and I didn't have to hear all the personal attacks on me out of that Democratic convention.	0
ClaimBuster	657	The first time -- and I did not criticize the President, because these things can happen -- once, and sometimes twice -- the second time the barracks in Lebanon were assaulted, as we all remember.	1
ClaimBuster	658	That was more than we had offered to all of Africa before from the federal government.	1
ClaimBuster	659	And what I want to do is to make sure that the plumber, the nurse, the firefighter, the teacher, the young entrepreneur who doesn't yet have money, I want to give them a tax break now.	0
ClaimBuster	660	Our third century should be the century of individual freedom for all our two hundred and fifteen million Americans today and all that join us.	0
ClaimBuster	661	I think we ought to have incentives to do it, I think we ought to push to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	662	Perhaps we might find that out tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	663	I'm asking the people's support as president.	0
ClaimBuster	664	I think I remember the question.	0
ClaimBuster	665	I don't want the law to supersede good law like we've got in Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	666	We are a big industrial state.	1
ClaimBuster	667	Trickle-down government has never worked here, has never worked anywhere.	1
ClaimBuster	668	And so in order to take pressure off the borders, in order to make the borders more secure, I believe there ought to be a temporary worker card that allows a willing worker and a willing employer to mate up, so long as there's not an American willing to do that job, to join up in order to be able to fulfill the employers' needs.	0
ClaimBuster	669	Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle.	1
ClaimBuster	670	We increased them to China 50 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	671	One final point if I might.	0
ClaimBuster	672	In order to keep America the strongest nation in the world, we need some continuity and some change.	0
ClaimBuster	673	It's a tool that law enforcement now uses to be able to talk between each other.	1
ClaimBuster	674	They develop a positive or negative self- image.	0
ClaimBuster	675	There's no doubt about it.	0
ClaimBuster	676	And I -- look, I'm all in favor of green energy.	0
ClaimBuster	677	And I would encourage the current administration to proceed with that kind of flexibility where it's appropriate and where it's done carefully and responsibly.	0
ClaimBuster	678	Now, again, to get to whether I am depending on magic, I think I have talked in straight economic terms about a program of recovery that I was told wouldn't work.	0
ClaimBuster	679	Our Air Force is older and smaller than at any time since it was founded in 1947.	1
ClaimBuster	680	You remember the last debate?	0
ClaimBuster	681	Now, the math doesn't work, but he continues to claim that he's going to do it.	1
ClaimBuster	682	Of course, we can take a hatchet and a scalpel to this budget.	0
ClaimBuster	683	And I believe that he will be outstanding.	0
ClaimBuster	684	Who's he gonna listen to -- us or the folks running up and down the aisles with money, the lobbyists, the PAC money?	0
ClaimBuster	685	Uh - let me uh - talk about uh - the economic announcements that were made just this past week.	0
ClaimBuster	686	And you know, I don't think age is the only criterion.	0
ClaimBuster	687	And here in a country which if it is moving ahead, if it's developing its economy to the fullest - which we are not now - in my judgment, we'll have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	688	And I've been supporting those and I know how to fix this economy, and eliminate our dependence on foreign oil, and stop sending $700 billion a year overseas.	1
ClaimBuster	689	She's not doing any me favors.	0
ClaimBuster	690	The SALT II treaty was the result of negotiations that Mr. Carter's team entered into after he had asked the Soviet Union for a discussion of actual reduction of nuclear strategic weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	691	It's time to end it.	0
ClaimBuster	692	You fill the prescription and Medicare pays half the cost.	1
ClaimBuster	693	I'm not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food - some of it rotting - even though there is a hungry world, and even though four million Americans wait every month for a food package from the government, which averages five cents a day per individual.	1
ClaimBuster	694	Now, here's what I want to do.	0
ClaimBuster	695	Folks on Social Security who've worked all their lives.	0
ClaimBuster	696	He's deployed more troops than any president in history around the world.	1
ClaimBuster	697	How anyone could think that any sane person would believe you could call back a nuclear missile, I think is as ridiculous as the whole concept has been.	0
ClaimBuster	698	That's what governors end up doing.	0
ClaimBuster	699	And it's going to be tough.	0
ClaimBuster	700	Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS.	1
ClaimBuster	701	Now, as for the proposals that I've worked for for renewables and conservation and efficiencies and new technologies.	0
ClaimBuster	702	And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991.	1
ClaimBuster	703	I want to expand our markets abroad and that's why I've called for that first economic summit to be on agriculture.	0
ClaimBuster	704	It did not do what it needed to do.	0
ClaimBuster	705	In fact, I think just the opposite.	0
ClaimBuster	706	It calls for a mutual reduction of these weapons, as I say, that neither of us can represent a threat to the other.	0
ClaimBuster	707	It's probably the reason that I'm in politics.	0
ClaimBuster	708	And if we're going to do some of the things you mentioned, like lowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it.	0
ClaimBuster	709	What we do is we have choice.	0
ClaimBuster	710	There -- there are people in Iran who have the same aspirations as people all around the world for a better life.	1
ClaimBuster	711	We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very -- I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	712	Well, Fiora (ph), I'm going to ask the American people to understand that there are some programs that we may have to eliminate.	0
ClaimBuster	713	I said that I would work for tax relief for middle class Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	714	And we're going to enforce those agreements, and we're going to look for businesses to help us by buying American products.	0
ClaimBuster	715	Well, the Administration was the first major country to stand up to the abuse in Tiananmen Square.	1
ClaimBuster	716	In fact, it's estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you're looking at 50 million people losing health insurance...	1
ClaimBuster	717	Medicaid's in one agency; Medicare is in a different one.	1
ClaimBuster	718	I can run this more efficiently than the federal government and states, by the way, are proving it.	0
ClaimBuster	719	Am I trying to indicate that we have no problems in Africa or Latin America or Asia?	0
ClaimBuster	720	Panama is a friendly country.	0
ClaimBuster	721	In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow-down in our economy, which helped bring the recession of fifty-four; which made the recession of fifty-eight rather intense, and which has slowed, somewhat, our economic activity in 1960.	0
ClaimBuster	722	And I recommend a spending freeze that -- except for defense, Veterans Affairs, and some other vital programs, we'll just have to have across-the-board freeze.	0
ClaimBuster	723	I am particularly concerned about the intercontinental weapons, the ones that can hit us.	0
ClaimBuster	724	So we know what he has said and what he's done to women.	0
ClaimBuster	725	I talked to him about how best to expedite the exploration of natural gas in Mexico and transport it up to the United States so we become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil.	1
ClaimBuster	726	I have worked so hard out here to help turn this economy around.	1
ClaimBuster	727	The president nominates, and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process.	0
ClaimBuster	728	They have funded Hezbollah, they have funded Hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon.	1
ClaimBuster	729	I do want to say that I was just endorsed -- and more are coming next week -- it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here -- admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country.	1
ClaimBuster	730	I would like to tell you something about me.	0
ClaimBuster	731	That's what he stated, again, a matter of record.	1
ClaimBuster	732	I thought the administration was at the negotiating table in Geneva suggesting that we ban mobile missile systems entirely.	0
ClaimBuster	733	The basic decision of the Supreme Court is that each person has to make this judgment in her own life, and that's the way it's been done.	1
ClaimBuster	734	And the reason is was so important -- and this is a testament to how we've restored American credibility and strength around the world -- is we had to make sure that all the countries participated, even countries like Russia and China.	0
ClaimBuster	735	He said trickle-down economics was voodoo economics; now he's it's biggest practitioner.	1
ClaimBuster	736	When Mr. Nixon went in office, for instance, we had three and a half million dollars spent on - on the White House and its staff.	1
ClaimBuster	737	On foreign affairs, some think it's irrelevant.	0
ClaimBuster	738	He makes that decision when he commits young men or young women who are going to go round and defend our liberty and our freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	739	It's the wrong thing to do.	0
ClaimBuster	740	He says we ought to have gun-free schools.	1
ClaimBuster	741	This is my point tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	742	But, look, the nature of the challenges that we're going to face are immense and one of the things that we know about the presidency is that it's never the challenges that you expect.	0
ClaimBuster	743	In addition we can have more exchange with Poland or with any other of the Iron Curtain countries which show some desire to take a different path than the path that has been taken by the ones that are complete satellites of the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	744	You don't buy any gun.	0
ClaimBuster	745	We have committed $200 million worth of aid.	1
ClaimBuster	746	In the Far East I think we need to continue to be uh - strong and uh - I would certainly uh - pursue the uh - normalization of uh - relationships with the People's Republic of China.	0
ClaimBuster	747	This is how I'm going to get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	748	I told her after we prayed and teared up and laughed some that I thought her husband's sacrifice was noble and worthy.	1
ClaimBuster	749	And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	750	And therefore, if I only had another second left, I'd say that that high school class in a military training - 40 of its 80 graduates last year entered the United States service academies; West Point, Annapolis and the Air Force Academy, and to see those young men made me very proud to realize that there are young people in this country that are prepared to go into that kind of a career in service of their country.	1
ClaimBuster	751	The Patriot Act is necessary, for example, because parts of the FBI couldn't talk to each other.	1
ClaimBuster	752	I believe that the cruise missiles which we are now developing in research and development across the spectrum from air, from the sea, or from the land, uh - can be uh - included within a SALT II agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	753	I want a Supreme Court that doesn't always side with corporate interests.	0
ClaimBuster	754	His influence is growing - mostly because this Administration has ignored Latin America.	1
ClaimBuster	755	He just declared it dead, ladies and gentlemen, and we walked away from the work of 160 nations over 10 years.	1
ClaimBuster	756	I've sat across the table from people who were out of work and worked with them to try and find new work or to help them through tough times.	1
ClaimBuster	757	I think if Barbara Bush were running this year she'd be elected.	0
ClaimBuster	758	I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion.	0
ClaimBuster	759	George Bush, a few years ago, said that Social Security was basically a welfare system.	1
ClaimBuster	760	We're providing that young woman with help.	0
ClaimBuster	761	It well describes the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	762	I believe in local control of schools.	0
ClaimBuster	763	We need to have a very carefully thought through phase-over.	0
ClaimBuster	764	I know because we did it there.	0
ClaimBuster	765	There is a very strong moral basis for this concept of equality of opportunity.	0
ClaimBuster	766	Supposing we had - had a Democratic Congress for the last two years and we'd had uh - Governor Carter as President.	0
ClaimBuster	767	I picked Lloyd Bentsen, distinguished, strong, mature, a leader in the Senate, somebody whose qualifications nobody has questioned.	1
ClaimBuster	768	The fact is that my health-care plan, America, is very simple.	0
ClaimBuster	769	I also believe that we need to say to people that if you cannot meet standards, there has to be a consequence.	0
ClaimBuster	770	But she wanted to look good for the election.	0
ClaimBuster	771	I'm going to fight for a fair trade playing field for the American worker.	0
ClaimBuster	772	First time one state had been number one in all four measures.	1
ClaimBuster	773	What we can't do, I think, is try to characterize each other as bad people.	0
ClaimBuster	774	I'll give you everything I have, if you want me to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	775	If we want to stop crime and teenage pregnancy, let's start with education.	0
ClaimBuster	776	But what is absolutely true is that, once we get through this economic crisis and some of the specific proposals to get us out of this slump, that we're not going to be able to go back to our profligate ways.	0
ClaimBuster	777	And I'm very proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	778	The Dorgan Task Force, which included two internal revenue commissioners, one a Republican, one a Democrat.	1
ClaimBuster	779	We have to bring back law and order.	0
ClaimBuster	780	Teddy Roosevelt used to say walk softly -- talk softly, but carry a big stick.	1
ClaimBuster	781	And with regards to young people coming along, I've got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question.	0
ClaimBuster	782	I want a check-off, so if the Congress can't do it, let people check off their income tax, 10% of it, to compel the government to cut spending.	0
ClaimBuster	783	He's going to probably go to jail.	0
ClaimBuster	784	We've had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies.	0
ClaimBuster	785	Greatly expand character education funding so that public schools will teach children values, values which have stood the test of time.	0
ClaimBuster	786	So what we said was you can't just sit on this for 10, 20, 30 years, decide when you want to drill, when you want to produce, when it's most profitable for you.	0
ClaimBuster	787	Yes, that's true, I didn't.	1
ClaimBuster	788	During the Clinton years, as you may recall, there was a fight over affirmative action.	1
ClaimBuster	789	I don't believe in big government, but I believe in effective governmental action.	0
ClaimBuster	790	It also means that we've got to make sure that young people like yourself are able to afford a college education.	0
ClaimBuster	791	You know, when Senator Obama ended up his conversation with Joe the plumber -- we need to spread the wealth around.	0
ClaimBuster	792	But it was simply wrong to finance their last scheme to cut Medicare $270 billion to run the risk of it withering on the vine.	0
ClaimBuster	793	And I'm sorry to tell you that, you know, there is a record here.	1
ClaimBuster	794	And so to make sure we end up getting rid of basic structural prejudice is education.	0
ClaimBuster	795	There were a whole bunch of oil companies.	0
ClaimBuster	796	And I do, both for corporations and for individuals.	0
ClaimBuster	797	The American people now are facing, next Tuesday, a lonely decision.	0
ClaimBuster	798	I said we're going to bet on American workers and the American auto industry and it's come surging back.	1
ClaimBuster	799	I want my fellow Americans to hear one more time.	0
ClaimBuster	800	If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun.	0
ClaimBuster	801	We are once again reliable suppliers and I would never use food as a political tool like our predecessors did.	1
ClaimBuster	802	Let them reach out beyond the confines of the current structure to recruit teach-for-the-children type teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	803	And the financial rescue plan that Senator McCain and I supported is an important first step.	0
ClaimBuster	804	"He went to Cincinnati and he gave a speech in which he said, ""We will plan carefully."	1
ClaimBuster	805	If the American people send me up to do this job, I intend to be there one term.	0
ClaimBuster	806	So there was a lot at stake there.	0
ClaimBuster	807	I have made a lot of decisions, and some of them little, like appointments to boards you never heard of, and some of them big.	1
ClaimBuster	808	While we were still dealing with our diplomats being threatened, Governor Romney put out a press release, trying to make political points, and that's not how a commander in chief operates.	1
ClaimBuster	809	No, because they've always wanted this to be an American effort.	1
ClaimBuster	810	It makes sure that the people coming across the border are humanely treated, that they're not kept in the shadows of our society, that they're able to go back and forth to see their families.	1
ClaimBuster	811	See the millions of these killings accumulate, and this is one where you can have an honest difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	812	And the biggest threat facing America is terrorists with weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	813	I apologize for it but that one got right to the national honor and I'm sorry.	0
ClaimBuster	814	You know, my hero is a guy named Teddy Roosevelt.	0
ClaimBuster	815	Drug use has doubled the past 44 months all across America.	1
ClaimBuster	816	She just went about 25 seconds over her time.	1
ClaimBuster	817	And I also believe, sir, that the most personal intimate decision that any woman is ever called upon to make is the decision as to whether or not she shall carry a pregnancy to term.	0
ClaimBuster	818	I want to move ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	819	This president has never once vetoed one bill; the first president in a hundred years not to do that.	1
ClaimBuster	820	I have been for border security for years.	1
ClaimBuster	821	If the president has any interest tonight, I'll detail it to you; I won't take 10 minutes tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	822	Saddam Hussein was a threat because he could have given weapons of mass destruction to terrorist enemies.	0
ClaimBuster	823	I just described what my plan is.	1
ClaimBuster	824	Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	825	Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, who's one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with Iran -- guess what -- without precondition.	1
ClaimBuster	826	But part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence.	0
ClaimBuster	827	It's just like you said in Texas one day, you know raised taxes too much, and you did, and you cut defense too much, Mr. President, and you did.	1
ClaimBuster	828	And that position is that the United States has a treaty - a treaty with all of the Organization of American States - which prohibits us from interfering in the internal affairs of any other state and prohibits them as well.	1
ClaimBuster	829	What I'm not for is us ignoring the other half of the equation.	0
ClaimBuster	830	After that, once again, our Embassy was exploded.	1
ClaimBuster	831	Now, Senator McCain talks a lot about earmarks.	1
ClaimBuster	832	I laid out seven steps, crippling sanctions were number one.	1
ClaimBuster	833	What I want America to do is to trade more but to compete and win by investing in competitive ways.	0
ClaimBuster	834	We do that all the time.	0
ClaimBuster	835	I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them.	1
ClaimBuster	836	Either he's for the President and he's against the position that those who opposed the President in fifty-five and fifty-nine - and the Senator's position itself, stated the other day in our debate - either he is for the President and against that position or we simply have a disagreement here that must continue to be debated.	0
ClaimBuster	837	I want to thank everybody who watched and listened tonight because this is indeed a crucial time in American history.	0
ClaimBuster	838	And under me, when I lead this country, the secretary of defense is going to have to make the choices, between how we keep, how we protect the survivability of our nuclear deployment on the Midgetman missile, or on the Minuteman, whatever it is.	0
ClaimBuster	839	I believe in protecting America first.	0
ClaimBuster	840	And I think that we're better off, for example with the Philippines, of trying to retain our friendship and help them right the wrongs we see, rather than throwing them to the wolves and then facing a Communist power in the Pacific.	0
ClaimBuster	841	And Senator McCain during that period said that we should keep on deregulating because that's how the free enterprise system works.	1
ClaimBuster	842	I think if we learned anything in Vietnam is you first commit this nation before you commit the troops to the battlefield.	0
ClaimBuster	843	I mentioned before that the local communities are having a harder time passing bond issues.	0
ClaimBuster	844	I put people behind bars for the rest of their life.	1
ClaimBuster	845	Then we took comments, as we always do, and there were tens of thousands of comments as to how we ought to do it.	1
ClaimBuster	846	...and -- and that's why I have the kind of commitment to ensure that our industries in this country can compete and be successful.	0
ClaimBuster	847	The whole world is having economic difficulties.	1
ClaimBuster	848	If a local school district in Cleveland or anyplace else wants to have a private choice plan like Milwaukee did, let them have at it.	0
ClaimBuster	849	With regard to business investment, it is higher than it has been since 1949.	1
ClaimBuster	850	... to oil, to tax breaks, then companies going overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	851	You will have the finest health care plan there is.	0
ClaimBuster	852	We've had 4 years where we've produced no private sector jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	853	Well -- well, let me give you an example of what Senator Obama finds objectionable, the business tax.	0
ClaimBuster	854	Well, I just want to say...	0
ClaimBuster	855	These kinds of things have hurt us very much.	0
ClaimBuster	856	I know the governor's not necessarily saying that but, you know, all of these flights that have come in, all of them have been in accordance with the sanctions regime, I'm told, except for three where they notified, and they're trying to break out of the box, there's no question about it.	1
ClaimBuster	857	I must remind him the Democrats have controlled the Congress for the last twenty-two years and they wrote all the tax bills.	1
ClaimBuster	858	Another thing that we need to do is to reestablish the good relationships that we ought to have between the United States and our natural allies and friends.	0
ClaimBuster	859	There've been over thirteen hundred indictments in HUD, over eight hundred convictions relating just to home loans.	1
ClaimBuster	860	And by the way, I've done these things.	1
ClaimBuster	861	Is anybody being discriminated against?	0
ClaimBuster	862	We got together seven Republicans, seven Democrats.	1
ClaimBuster	863	We need to be talking about space.	0
ClaimBuster	864	But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune.	1
ClaimBuster	865	But I can tell you that I think America is safer today than it was on 9/11.	0
ClaimBuster	866	We don't have an adequate requirement for the insulation of homes, for the efficiency of automobiles.	0
ClaimBuster	867	Will we have equal pay for women, which is going backwards?	0
ClaimBuster	868	It's all those businesses that employ one-quarter of the workers in America; these small businesses that are taxed as individuals.	1
ClaimBuster	869	What means something is: Do you have a plan?	0
ClaimBuster	870	I voted against it; Senator Obama voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	871	But let's at least focus...	0
ClaimBuster	872	Reductions of that kind will not permit the United States to be strong enough to deter aggression and maintain the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	873	But that does not mean that we will cease to protect the rights of the unborn.	0
ClaimBuster	874	India started from about the same place that China did.	0
ClaimBuster	875	And I want to honor that among his other achievements here.	0
ClaimBuster	876	Being haunted, a thousand points of light - I don't know what that means.	0
ClaimBuster	877	One of the overwhelming results that I've seen in the polls is that people feel that you can't plan anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	878	That's why we're losing -- we're losing -- we lose on everything.	0
ClaimBuster	879	I did the right decision.	0
ClaimBuster	880	And the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate.	1
ClaimBuster	881	What do you think they're going to do when the campaign's over?	0
ClaimBuster	882	And with the plan that -- that I have, that will do that.	0
ClaimBuster	883	This is supposed to be the year of the women in the Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	884	Now incidentally, I should point out here that Senator Kennedy has attacked our foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	885	The American people are up to here with debates.	0
ClaimBuster	886	Now, I know Donald Trump doesn't like to think of himself as small anything, but -- but that's how you define small businesses if you're getting business income.	0
ClaimBuster	887	For instance, some that have been forgotten; we need to have the reactor core - below ground level, the entire power plant that uses atomic uh - power tightly sealed and a heavy - heavy vacuum maintained.	0
ClaimBuster	888	Again Governor Carter is inaccurate.	0
ClaimBuster	889	If you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go to Congress, fight for it.	0
ClaimBuster	890	Senator Obama talks about voting for budgets.	1
ClaimBuster	891	He can't come here and tell you that he's left no child behind because he didn't fund no child left behind.	1
ClaimBuster	892	The reason Magic Johnson resigned from the AIDS Commission is because the statement you heard tonight from Mr. Bush is the longest and best statement he's made about it in public.	1
ClaimBuster	893	You can't stop all outsourcing, Charlie.	0
ClaimBuster	894	But we have to use our military wisely.	0
ClaimBuster	895	If laws need to be strengthened, like instant background checks, that's important.	0
ClaimBuster	896	As far as our other issues that he brought up are concerned, I know the veterans.	0
ClaimBuster	897	I met a young woman in -- in Philadelphia who's coming out of -- out of college, can't find work.	1
ClaimBuster	898	All of that would be lost if we followed Senator Obama's plan to have specific dates with withdrawal, regardless of conditions on the ground.	0
ClaimBuster	899	And it's a long list of specific items.	0
ClaimBuster	900	For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns.	1
ClaimBuster	901	And believe me, everybody on the factory floor all over this country knows it.	0
ClaimBuster	902	This debate tonight has made crystal clear a challenge that is as old as America -- the choice between hope and fear, change or more of the same, the courage to move into a new tomorrow or to listen to the crowd who says things could be worse.	0
ClaimBuster	903	Perhaps that oil abroad should be treated differently than the oil here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	904	And I understand that we have to say never again to a Holocaust and never again to Rwanda.	0
ClaimBuster	905	And I've got to tell you that vouchers, where they are requested and where they are agreed to, are a good and workable system.	0
ClaimBuster	906	You're going to have 120 to 150 new members of Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	907	That means those cars can be exported, 'cause that's the demand around the world, and it also means that it'll save money in your pocketbook.	1
ClaimBuster	908	I will bring back jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	909	That's going to help to create jobs here.	0
ClaimBuster	910	When I walked into the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion-dollar deficit greeting me.	1
ClaimBuster	911	Otherwise, the world won't be better off.	0
ClaimBuster	912	Or will we have a world of peace with the threat of atomic weapons eliminated, with full trade, with our people at work, inflation controlled, openness in government, our people proud once again, Congress, citizens, president, secretary of state working in harmony and unity toward a common future?	0
ClaimBuster	913	We're not going to go unilaterally.	0
ClaimBuster	914	I think most people know that I did not seek the presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	915	We have it on tape.	1
ClaimBuster	916	The integration of Central and Eastern European democracies into a new partnership with NATO.	1
ClaimBuster	917	We also are pursuing housing programs.	1
ClaimBuster	918	I -- I just have to correct the record here.	0
ClaimBuster	919	How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	920	"It's called ""Make America Great Again."""	1
ClaimBuster	921	And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	922	And this is known oil reserves, known supplies.	0
ClaimBuster	923	And it really is the cost, the escalating costs of health care that are inflicting such pain on working families and people across this country.	0
ClaimBuster	924	Meanwhile, we started the -- also in '93 to look into whether cigarettes were addictive enough for the Federal Food and Drug Administration to ban the ability of cigarette companies to advertise, market and distribute their products to our kids.	1
ClaimBuster	925	I served it uh - in the war.	1
ClaimBuster	926	I think it's interesting to point out that uh - in the uh - two years that I've been president I've vetoed fifty-six bills.	1
ClaimBuster	927	I'm going to change that.	0
ClaimBuster	928	You know, that's been stretched by the pro-abortion movement in America to mean almost anything.	0
ClaimBuster	929	I know you probably would oppose it, Mr. President, but I think we should have a fairer system and a flatter system, and we'll have a fairer and flatter system and we're going to make the economic package work.	0
ClaimBuster	930	The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.	0
ClaimBuster	931	And as a matter of principle -- and my situation is unique, and I understand it -- I would take absolutely no compensation; I go as their servant.	0
ClaimBuster	932	We had a guarantee -- and what happened?	0
ClaimBuster	933	Mr. Kraft, I believe that the American people, in the next four years under a Ford administration, will be called upon to make those necessary sacrifices to preserve the peace which we have.	0
ClaimBuster	934	One of my disagreements with the present Administration has been that I don't feel a real effort has been made an this very sensitive subject, not only of nuclear controls, but also of general disarmament.	1
ClaimBuster	935	So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation.	0
ClaimBuster	936	I have sat down with Democrats and Republicans at the beginning of my term.	1
ClaimBuster	937	Because has won the support of a great many people all over the state and I think it's a model for what I hope we can do across the country.	0
ClaimBuster	938	If people would say, well, he got elected to do this and then the Congress says, okay, I'm going to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	939	But this is an exciting time.	0
ClaimBuster	940	We're working through the international organizations.	0
ClaimBuster	941	We have to be willing to make good, sound judgments.	0
ClaimBuster	942	... no troops through whatsoever.	1
ClaimBuster	943	One, of course, is to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	944	And you go visit some of those kids in the hospitals today who were maimed because they don't have the armament.	0
ClaimBuster	945	Bill Clinton tried the approach that I'm talking about.	1
ClaimBuster	946	When I got involved, I didn't fail.	1
ClaimBuster	947	That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting.	1
ClaimBuster	948	And the president is moving to the creation of our own bunker- busting nuclear weapon.	1
ClaimBuster	949	We lost three thousand American lives.	1
ClaimBuster	950	The question, I think, should be enlarged.	0
ClaimBuster	951	I say that to both political parties.	0
ClaimBuster	952	We saw that message in the late 70s when heard a lot about change, and what happened, that misery index went right through the roof.	1
ClaimBuster	953	He's 70 years old, has high blood pressure, his wife has heart trouble.	1
ClaimBuster	954	He's also shown a weakness in yielding to pressure.	0
ClaimBuster	955	Well, it was not one of my ads, either, Governor.	1
ClaimBuster	956	So what one hand giveth, the other hand taketh away.	0
ClaimBuster	957	The proposal advanced by you and by Mr. Javits would have cost six hundred millions of dollars - Mr. Rockefeller rejected it in New York, said he didn't agree with the financing at all, said it ought to be on Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	958	Now, I will not allow somebody to come in and change Roe v. Wade.	0
ClaimBuster	959	Our international competitors that are cleaning our plate have an intelligent relationship between government and business, and a supportive relationship.	0
ClaimBuster	960	And I will cut taxes for middle-class families.	0
ClaimBuster	961	It is not a good deal for the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	962	And yet they were polled by the U.S.I.A.	1
ClaimBuster	963	But my experience -- my experience the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost.	0
ClaimBuster	964	So if the farmers' economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country.	0
ClaimBuster	965	I will say this -	0
ClaimBuster	966	So the problem is - it's not that the working is being taxed too little or the person working out - the woman working in some factory being taxed too little.	0
ClaimBuster	967	Now we tried to do this under President Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	968	I would not favor the uh - payment of uh - of a given fixed income to people unless they are not able to work.	0
ClaimBuster	969	My wife Tipper, who is here, actually went on a military plane with General Sholicatchvieli on one of those flights.	1
ClaimBuster	970	And that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds.	0
ClaimBuster	971	And when we haven't done it, as in North Korea -- let me just take one more example -- in North Korea, we cut off talks.	1
ClaimBuster	972	But to add one other feature, I don't control any of the tapes.	1
ClaimBuster	973	Let me say that this is one of the most important issues in the world to me.	0
ClaimBuster	974	Those are very clear differences.	0
ClaimBuster	975	Now, he says he's only going to tax the rich.	1
ClaimBuster	976	And that example that President Eisenhower has set we will continue to follow.	0
ClaimBuster	977	... a very clear fact that...	0
ClaimBuster	978	There are things we can do like the Kassebaum bill.	0
ClaimBuster	979	In San Diego where we had some defense cutbacks, we funded a project for the University of California San Diego to use airplane composite materials to build lighter, stronger bridges, a little project in a program that Senator Dole opposed.	1
ClaimBuster	980	We cannot let it happen.	0
ClaimBuster	981	We created partnerships throughout the region to deal with extremism in Somalia, in Yemen, in Pakistan.	1
ClaimBuster	982	This is a very important issue we're talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	983	Im- most importantly, consumer confidence as surveyed by the reputable organization at the University of Michigan is at the highest since 1972.	1
ClaimBuster	984	We've been remarkably successful, with the help of a Democratic Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	985	India under a free society has been making some progress.	1
ClaimBuster	986	And that is not reflected in the kind of budget that you're putting forward because it just doesn't work.	0
ClaimBuster	987	Go out and take a look at St. Louis at some of that effort.	0
ClaimBuster	988	When you're the president of the United States, you have a public trust and you have to keep that public trust, as George Washington, as Abraham Lincoln did.	0
ClaimBuster	989	For 38 years one party has controlled the House of Representatives, and the result, a sorry little post office that can't do anything right and a bank that has more overdrafts than all the Chase Bank and Citibank put together.	1
ClaimBuster	990	More than that, it was the first national security decision that we had to make.	1
ClaimBuster	991	And I believe that -- that we ought to recognize the value to our children and grandchildren of taking steps that preserve the environment in a way that's good for them.	0
ClaimBuster	992	I believe in freedom of choice.	0
ClaimBuster	993	And that was, we had adequate warning that there was a threat to our embassy, and we could have done what other embassies did - either strengthen our security there, or remove our personnel before the kidnap and the takeover took place.	1
ClaimBuster	994	You've got one more energy -- you've got one more question.	0
ClaimBuster	995	There ought to be a standardized design.	0
ClaimBuster	996	But -- and I say that about a lot of things.	0
ClaimBuster	997	And so I say in conclusion, keep America's faith strong.	0
ClaimBuster	998	Now, I've listed the things that I think have to be at the top of the list.	0
ClaimBuster	999	Number three, the pre - Vice President suggests that we should keep the Communists in doubt about whether we would fight on Quemoy and Matsu.	0
ClaimBuster	1000	We ought to appoint a commission, just as we did in Social Security in 1983, when we rescued Social Security, and I was proud to be on that commission, along with Claude Pepper, the champion of senior citizens from Florida.	1
ClaimBuster	1001	There are some changes that I would like to make.	0
ClaimBuster	1002	It's not Social Security plus, it's Social Security plus huge debt.	0
ClaimBuster	1003	Not only that, you named the day.	1
ClaimBuster	1004	But just take a look at the positions of the ACLU.	0
ClaimBuster	1005	Now, what's wrong with Star Wars?	0
ClaimBuster	1006	They have good people and they play constructive roles sometimes, but sometimes they get too much power.	0
ClaimBuster	1007	In fact, it was a Republican idea.	1
ClaimBuster	1008	If you create Saddam Hussein, over a 10-year period, using billions of dollars of US taxpayer money, step up to the plate and say it was a mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	1009	But the fact is that we need to absolutely not stand for the kind of things that have been going on.	0
ClaimBuster	1010	The best way to defend America in this world we live in is to stay on the offense.	0
ClaimBuster	1011	I would reach out to our allies in a way that this president hasn't.	0
ClaimBuster	1012	I have helped to balance the budget for the first time in 30 years, paid down the debt.	1
ClaimBuster	1013	...and $500 billion over the next five.	1
ClaimBuster	1014	There are guys that couldn't get a job third shift in a Dairy Queen driving BMWs and Mercedes selling drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	1015	I will not let that happen.	0
ClaimBuster	1016	Well, we have a comparison that we can make.	0
ClaimBuster	1017	I've been trying so hard not to.	0
ClaimBuster	1018	Those are the people who in the 1980s had their incomes go up while their taxes went down.	1
ClaimBuster	1019	But I'm very -- that's one of the real success stories here of the work we've done.	0
ClaimBuster	1020	And it was major -- a major factor in bringing about the end of the Cold War.	0
ClaimBuster	1021	He and his running-mate didn't show up to vote when they could have got it going in the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	1022	We're going to have regulatory -- we're gonna have litigation reform.	0
ClaimBuster	1023	The offshore drilling rights is a question that Governor Reagan raises often.	1
ClaimBuster	1024	Well, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.	1
ClaimBuster	1025	It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people.	0
ClaimBuster	1026	Met Mr. Shevardnadze and talked substance with him the other day.	1
ClaimBuster	1027	Fox the other day in New Hampshire, who's suffering from Parkinson's, and he wants us to do stem cell, embryonic stem cell.	1
ClaimBuster	1028	And I have a record -- and Somalia, I opposed that we should turn -- turn the force in Somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force, which they were not capable of.	1
ClaimBuster	1029	Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives.	0
ClaimBuster	1030	I've worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America.	1
ClaimBuster	1031	I've said that eight years ago they campaigned on prescription drugs for seniors.	1
ClaimBuster	1032	Oh, I'm a pretty calm guy.	0
ClaimBuster	1033	It's sort of ad hoc, just whatever comes up, we'll deal with it.	0
ClaimBuster	1034	And that is, I wouldn't join the International Criminal Court.	0
ClaimBuster	1035	And she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the United States?	0
ClaimBuster	1036	In terms of regional tensions, we have now gotten the attention of the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	1037	We've got Guards and Reserves who are doing double duties.	1
ClaimBuster	1038	Now, when JFK said we're going to the Moon in 10 years, nobody was sure how to do it, but we understood that, if the American people make a decision to do something, it gets done.	1
ClaimBuster	1039	When you've got seven and a half, eight million people out of work, and you've got three times as much inflation as you had during the last eight-year Democratic administration, when you have the highest deficits in history; when you have it uh - becoming increasingly difficult far a family to put a child through college or to own a home, there's a natural inclination to be turned off.	1
ClaimBuster	1040	I believe in its greatness.	0
ClaimBuster	1041	It was a bipartisan approach, but it's been rejected.	1
ClaimBuster	1042	Why I'll win is I think I have the best plan of the 3 of us up here to do something about it.	0
ClaimBuster	1043	It's good for small businesses, good for owners.	0
ClaimBuster	1044	And it isn't really higher prices, it's just, you are reducing the value of the money.	0
ClaimBuster	1045	The only involvement I've had with ACORN was I represented them alongside the U.S. Justice Department in making Illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people get registered at DMVs.	1
ClaimBuster	1046	She said a lot of things that were false.	1
ClaimBuster	1047	We can get into a war by letting events get out of hand, as they have in the last three and a half years under the foreign policies of this Administration of Mr. Carter's, until we're faced each time with a crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	1048	That if given a chance to be free, they will show up at the polls.	0
ClaimBuster	1049	Now I cannot, and would not, endorse the kind of program that uh - Governor Carter recommends.	0
ClaimBuster	1050	They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care.	1
ClaimBuster	1051	These constant suggestions that the basic Social Security System should be changed does call for concern and consternation among the aged of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	1052	I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief.	1
ClaimBuster	1053	And I believe that we can together do things that are within the grasp of Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	1054	Uh I call that the people amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	1055	He now says he's going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don't have to worry.	1
ClaimBuster	1056	Again I say, think of the Americans with Disabilities Act.	0
ClaimBuster	1057	Well let me make one thing clear.	0
ClaimBuster	1058	I think we still need affirmative action.	0
ClaimBuster	1059	Fifteen months ago, he was a cosigner and advocating the very tax cut that I am proposing, and said that that would be a forward step in fighting inflation, and that it would be beneficial to the working people of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	1060	That wasn't proven when Ronald Reagan said we would do SDI, which is missile defense.	1
ClaimBuster	1061	Strong families need a strong economy.	0
ClaimBuster	1062	We're going to have trade agreements that we enforce.	0
ClaimBuster	1063	Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	1064	In some of the discussions we've had about when it's appropriate for the U.S. to use force around the world, at times the standards that you've laid down have given me the impression that if it's something like a genocide taking place or what they called ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, that that alone would not be, that that wouldn't be the kind of situation that would cause you to think that the U.S. ought to get involved with troops.	0
ClaimBuster	1065	We did come forward with a program of students for the Congo of over three hundred which was more than the federal government had for all of Africa the previous year, so that I don't think that uh - we have moved at least in those two areas with sufficient vigor.	1
ClaimBuster	1066	It's a gateway to out-of-control spending and corruption.	0
ClaimBuster	1067	We want to make certain we protect those in the pipeline just as we did back in 1983 and we did it on a bipartisan basis.	0
ClaimBuster	1068	No, I'm saying our principal need now is to stabilize the tax base, which is the job base, and create a growing, dynamic base.	0
ClaimBuster	1069	And frankly, I think we have a lot more loving of our neighbor to do in this country and on this planet.	0
ClaimBuster	1070	I'm sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine, here -- here with me.	0
ClaimBuster	1071	I know what it's like to rely on others for support and courage and love in tough times.	0
ClaimBuster	1072	I've seen it authoritatively written twice, and if I've done him an injustice, and he didn't say it, I'm very, very sorry.	0
ClaimBuster	1073	Why don't we stop this madness now and draw a line and keep the heavens free from war?	0
ClaimBuster	1074	The war started in 2003, and at the time when the war started, you said it was going to be quick and easy.	1
ClaimBuster	1075	I do not intend to spend one minute of one day thinking about re-election.	0
ClaimBuster	1076	And therefore Congress passes the bill after our session in 1997 ended, we passed an enabling legislation in 1999.	1
ClaimBuster	1077	And I believe we're all children of the same God.	0
ClaimBuster	1078	And when it comes to our military and Chinese security, part of the reason that we were able to pivot to the Asia-Pacific region after having ended the war in Iraq and transitioning out of Afghanistan, is precisely because this is going to be a massive growth area in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	1079	And I think that's a private matter.	0
ClaimBuster	1080	As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we're talking about potentially a 30 -- a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time.	1
ClaimBuster	1081	And that's where there's been a great uh generation of despair, and ill health, and the lack of education, lack of purposefulness, and the lack of hope for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	1082	But that in and of itself was a good thing.	0
ClaimBuster	1083	And I think I'm more in touch with the mainstream of America.	0
ClaimBuster	1084	I was opposed to the war.	1
ClaimBuster	1085	I happen to believe that the Federal Government has usurped powers of autonomy and authority that belong back at the state and local level.	0
ClaimBuster	1086	... have a good time, folks.	0
ClaimBuster	1087	And I know these campaigns get knocked a lot, but I think I'd be a better President now for having had to travel to these communities and understand the family values and the importance of neighborhood.	0
ClaimBuster	1088	On the third time we sent welfare reform to the president he signed it but announced he would change it next year, and the vice president said they were going to do something else through the line item veto which I've never understood, but that's sort of inside baseball.	1
ClaimBuster	1089	That's having a government from the people.	0
ClaimBuster	1090	In athletics, we know it.	0
ClaimBuster	1091	And for all the rest of the parents in America who are wondering about their kids going to the school or anywhere else in the world, what kind of world they're going to grow up in, let me look you in the eye and say to you: I defended this country as a young man in war, and I will defend it as president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	1092	If you stop the drugs, nobody is going to use the drugs; so don't smoke, don't drink, don't use drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	1093	The education is a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	1094	Tax reform is relevant for old and young alike.	0
ClaimBuster	1095	With regard to a platform on the Supreme Court, I can only say one thing about that.	0
ClaimBuster	1096	But to have a situation, as you mentioned in our earlier comments, that the most expensive education in the world is in the United States of America also means that it cries out for reform, as well.	1
ClaimBuster	1097	That's not appropriate to do.	0
ClaimBuster	1098	But I don't think there's anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country and assisting our family farms and providing a good strong future for rural communities and for rural America and at the same time working on Third World debt.	0
ClaimBuster	1099	The farmers were the victims of the double-digit inflation and the 211/2-percent interest rates of the Carter-Mondale administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier.	1
ClaimBuster	1100	I don't see how you can lead this country in a time of war, in a time of uncertainty, if you change your mind because of politics.	0
ClaimBuster	1101	But I do think that Saddam Hussein is stronger than he was.	0
ClaimBuster	1102	One-third of the president's budget is at the president's discretion, or really the Congress, since they appropriate every dime and tell a president how to spend every dime.	1
ClaimBuster	1103	So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.	1
ClaimBuster	1104	The thing that separates my candidacy and makes it unique is that this came from millions of people in 50 states all over this country who wanted a candidate that worked and belonged to nobody but them.	0
ClaimBuster	1105	I'd also like to see the overtime laws change so that we could have some more flex time so that at the discretion of the worker, the worker, if you earn overtime, you could decide when you want that time to be taken, in cash or in time with your family if you've got a family problem.	0
ClaimBuster	1106	I would wind up -- I mean, it's the last question and I would mischaracterize it to try to make you happy.	0
ClaimBuster	1107	And she speaks English a lot better than I do.	0
ClaimBuster	1108	And we are making sure that those we help are those who will be friends of ours in the long term and friends of our allies in the region over the long term.	0
ClaimBuster	1109	When George Bush came into office, we had surpluses.	1
ClaimBuster	1110	So you, dear voters, are out there on the auction block, and these two candidates are bidding for your votes.	0
ClaimBuster	1111	But I want to go back to 1965.	0
ClaimBuster	1112	That's just flat wrong, and that's not what America is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	1113	... we can't -- we have not seen Republicans serious about this issue at all.	0
ClaimBuster	1114	I'm not going to appoint a judge to the Court who's going to undo a constitutional right, whether it's the First Amendment, or the Fifth Amendment, or some other right that's given under our courts today -- under the Constitution.	0
ClaimBuster	1115	I wasn't the one that said 5.4 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	1116	Four, in the votes at the U.N., particularly the vote dealing with Red China last Saturday, we received the support on the position that we had taken of only two African countries - one, Liberia, which had been tied to us for more than a century, and the other, Union of South Africa, which is not a popular country in Africa.	1
ClaimBuster	1117	This is a decision that the president of the United States must make.	0
ClaimBuster	1118	Question really is who do you want in the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	1119	And it's a big fight.	0
ClaimBuster	1120	That's what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.	0
ClaimBuster	1121	I submit to you that as you look at his programs, his program for example with regard to the Federal Reserve and uh - free money or loose money uh - high - low interest rates, his program in the economic field generally are the programs that were adopted and tried during the Truman Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	1122	This is the private market.	1
ClaimBuster	1123	What we need to do is go after...	0
ClaimBuster	1124	I think it's a triumph.	0
ClaimBuster	1125	So here's what we do.	0
ClaimBuster	1126	You know, some parents are worried about those filters, that you will have to ask your kids how to put them on there.	1
ClaimBuster	1127	You'll get your chance in a moment.	0
ClaimBuster	1128	And so, we made a proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	1129	For what purpose it was put in place, I can't imagine.	0
ClaimBuster	1130	There are all kinds of ways to create jobs in the inner city.	0
ClaimBuster	1131	Well I failed to mention North Korea and Cuba, a while ago.	1
ClaimBuster	1132	But when -- when Governor Romney says that he'll replace it with something, but can't detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isn't a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem.	1
ClaimBuster	1133	Since then, he has blamed the people for inflation, OPEC, he has blamed the Federal Reserve system, he has blamed the lack of productivity of the American people, he has then accused the people of living too well and that we must share in scarcity, we must sacrifice and get used to doing with less.	0
ClaimBuster	1134	Not only has an innocent person been executed, but the real perpetrator of the crime has not been held accountable for it.	1
ClaimBuster	1135	Nine out of 10 active-duty Army divisions are either in Iraq, going to Iraq or have come back from Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	1136	When youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a senior official in the federal government spending billions of dollars in taxpayerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s money and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a mature individual and you make a mistake, then that was on our ticket.	0
ClaimBuster	1137	I would not work hard to support any of those.	0
ClaimBuster	1138	But there are many people who I admire in this country today.	0
ClaimBuster	1139	Now, maybe we made a wrong turn with Kennedy, but I'll be proud of supporting him all of my life.	0
ClaimBuster	1140	Senator Dole has two or three times before tonight criticized me for working with the U.N. Now I'm being criticized for not working with the U.N.	1
ClaimBuster	1141	We're not making things anymore, relatively speaking.	0
ClaimBuster	1142	So it could end up having an adverse effect on everybody, and that's why we had to take action.	0
ClaimBuster	1143	That was the right thing to do.	0
ClaimBuster	1144	Number one, we can do this through the African Union, providing we give them the logistical support.	0
ClaimBuster	1145	I don't want to have our military involved in Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	1146	And so, we've got to introduce high technology into health care.	0
ClaimBuster	1147	And that means, of course, the best man that this nation can produce.	0
ClaimBuster	1148	And I think that something can be done from there, because a goal for all of us should be that one day, things will be done neither because of nor in spite of any of the differences between us - ethnic differences or racial differences, whatever they may be - that we will have total equal opportunity for all people.	0
ClaimBuster	1149	This election will also determine what kind of world we leave our children.	0
ClaimBuster	1150	I think that, if you look at the record and the impressions of the American people -- Bob, your network just did a poll, showing that two-thirds of the American people think that Senator McCain is running a negative campaign versus one-third of mine.	1
ClaimBuster	1151	That's why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians.	0
ClaimBuster	1152	We're talking about drugs made right here in the United States of America that have American brand names on them and American bottles.	0
ClaimBuster	1153	Well, Mr. Nixon hasn't discussed the two basic questions: what is going to be done and what will be his policy on implementing the Supreme Court decision of 1954?	0
ClaimBuster	1154	Fourthly, I believe we should not carry out a hard money, high interest rate policy which helped intensify certainly the recession of 1958, and I think helped bring the slow-down of 1960.	0
ClaimBuster	1155	I will make a commitment to bring health care coverage of high quality that is affordable to every single child in America within four years.	0
ClaimBuster	1156	With decent and affordable healthcare for all working families.	0
ClaimBuster	1157	But here's what I said.	0
ClaimBuster	1158	But we need to have leadership -- leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if -- if it's a Republican or a Democrat.	0
ClaimBuster	1159	When I became president I used the authority I had in this law to get out from certain federal rules to help states move people to work.	1
ClaimBuster	1160	When I'm President of the United States, we're going to use the National Guard and whatever sources we need to stop some of the drugs coming into America.	0
ClaimBuster	1161	And when it comes to this issue, when I say that we are going to find out exactly what happened, everybody will be held accountable.	0
ClaimBuster	1162	We have in -- in Egypt, a Muslim Brotherhood president.	1
ClaimBuster	1163	I voted for the Formosa resolution in 1955.	1
ClaimBuster	1164	And sound fiscal policy is the best answer, I think, to all the three problems you mentioned.	0
ClaimBuster	1165	I hope we can succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	1166	And he's got a lot of experience, but so do I.	1
ClaimBuster	1167	Women work for 76 cents on the dollar for the same work that men do.	1
ClaimBuster	1168	I agree with her on one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	1169	I am answering your questions.	0
ClaimBuster	1170	In the case of the Helsinki agreement - it may have been a good agreement at the beginning, but we have failed to enforce the so-called basket three part, which insures the right of people to migrate, to join their families, to be free, to speak out.	1
ClaimBuster	1171	And when it comes to South Korea, we've got a trade agreement up right now, they are sending hundreds of thousands of South Korean cars into the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	1172	The basic problem with it, it doesn't balance the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	1173	It's what leadership is based on.	0
ClaimBuster	1174	So I think what was wrong -- I give credit where credit is due -- but the responsibility was in coddling Saddam Hussein when there was no reason to do it and when people at high levels in our government knew he was trying to do things that were outrageous.	1
ClaimBuster	1175	Its growth rate is not what counts; it's whether it is catching up with us and it is not catching up with us.	0
ClaimBuster	1176	I think they'll choose it, because it's a net plus of $5 billion to them.	1
ClaimBuster	1177	The right to vote is basic.	0
ClaimBuster	1178	Sometimes they didn't come out with a clear regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	1179	But I want to be a president of the United States who makes sure that we never again do business with a drug-running Panamanian dictator, that we never again funnel aid to the contras through convicted drug dealers.	0
ClaimBuster	1180	How do we prevent attacks?	0
ClaimBuster	1181	So this -- this is not -- this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get America energy secure.	0
ClaimBuster	1182	Number two, seeing a -- a replacement government being responsible people is critical for us.	0
ClaimBuster	1183	He did not say that.	1
ClaimBuster	1184	Social Security is in surplus $70 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	1185	My definition of national strength is to make certain that a dollar spent buys us a dollar's worth of defense.	0
ClaimBuster	1186	A growing, expanding job base to generate the funds and the tax revenues to pay off the mess and rebuild America.	0
ClaimBuster	1187	We arm to parley, Winston Churchill said ten years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	1188	No longer do we give an image of vitality.	0
ClaimBuster	1189	We had the slowest growth, about 2.5 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	1190	Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	1191	We've lost in our foreign policy, the character of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	1192	In fact, he's done the opposite.	1
ClaimBuster	1193	Now, let me just go back with you very briefly.	0
ClaimBuster	1194	Now, when Senator McCain is proposing tax cuts that would give the average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts, that's not sharing a burden.	1
ClaimBuster	1195	And -- and so we -- we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet.	1
ClaimBuster	1196	He'd just said Jim Baker was going to be secretary of state and in the first debate he said no, now he's gonna be responsible for domestic economic policy.	1
ClaimBuster	1197	Senator Obama, I am not President Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	1198	When it comes to bridges, I want a bridge to the future.	0
ClaimBuster	1199	You take a look at all the programs you've advocated, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	1200	You can take a look at the op-ed...	0
ClaimBuster	1201	95% of all seniors would get no help whatsoever under my opponent's plan for the first four or five years.	1
ClaimBuster	1202	And we have to get the very most of uh - out uh - out of our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	1203	And our state cares a lot about our children.	0
ClaimBuster	1204	It had to do with the discussion we had had the previous day on the overall question of reducing the budget.	0
ClaimBuster	1205	But, Peter, so much of it is, gets into a whole other phase of things.	0
ClaimBuster	1206	Every 18-year-old can go to college.	0
ClaimBuster	1207	Last point I want to make, though.	0
ClaimBuster	1208	And she was in the hospital, and I went in to talk to her and tell her what I was thinking of doing.	1
ClaimBuster	1209	Our jobs are fleeing the country.	1
ClaimBuster	1210	We're not making those choices.	0
ClaimBuster	1211	Now, I have to tell you, I would do something different.	0
ClaimBuster	1212	So we can't ignore those lessons of history.	0
ClaimBuster	1213	I think under those circumstances they would refrain from pushing us to our knees as they did in 1973 with their previous oil embargo.	1
ClaimBuster	1214	I've chuckled a few times at some of their comments.	1
ClaimBuster	1215	We built more houses in the last seven years than in any Administration and thirty percent more than in the previous Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	1216	It'd be fine with me.	0
ClaimBuster	1217	First of all, it's a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution which President Clinton defeated.	1
ClaimBuster	1218	And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing.	1
ClaimBuster	1219	They've got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing.	0
ClaimBuster	1220	And I think that the Constitution has a right to privacy in it that shouldn't be subject to state referendum, any more than our First Amendment rights are subject to state referendum, any more than many of the other rights that we have should be subject to popular vote.	0
ClaimBuster	1221	And off-shore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge.	0
ClaimBuster	1222	I thought it would be better for the country than it was.	0
ClaimBuster	1223	I'm talking about the one that was proposed to deal --	0
ClaimBuster	1224	There are no nuclear missiles pointed at the children of the United States tonight and have not been in our administration for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age.	1
ClaimBuster	1225	But I am not for doing anything that would affect hunters or sportsmen, rifles, shotguns, existing handguns.	0
ClaimBuster	1226	I was against -- I was against the war in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	1227	And he defined that as someone who uses beans in place of meat.	1
ClaimBuster	1228	Thirdly, spread what's called health savings accounts.	0
ClaimBuster	1229	But generally I believe that a president has to be willing to do what he thinks is right.	0
ClaimBuster	1230	So, my formula says grow at the rate of inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	1231	We've got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	1232	Under the new bill, if I had signed it, a person like that could never have had any recovery.	1
ClaimBuster	1233	How does he avoid conflict?	0
ClaimBuster	1234	And when the phrase a strict constructionist is used and when the names of Scalia and Thomas are used as the benchmarks for who would be appointed, those are code words, and nobody should mistake this, for saying the governor would appoint people who would overturn Roe v. Wade.	1
ClaimBuster	1235	After 9/11, we had to recognize that when we saw a threat, we must take it seriously before it comes to hurt us.	0
ClaimBuster	1236	Inflation is robbing us, as we've already discussed, and the government bureaucracy is uh - just a horrible mess.	0
ClaimBuster	1237	You know, he always is looking for some conspiracy.	0
ClaimBuster	1238	And, as I say, we've had tough economic times, and it's exports that have saved us, exports that have built.	1
ClaimBuster	1239	Now with respect to a couple of things Senator McCain said, the notion that I voted for a tax increase for people making $42,000 a year has been disputed by everybody who has looked at this claim that Senator McCain keeps on making.	1
ClaimBuster	1240	That's one that I understand and certainly will carry out.	0
ClaimBuster	1241	The person who wants to use a gun for an illegal purpose can get it whether it's registered or outlawed.	0
ClaimBuster	1242	A president sets the strategy and relies upon good military people to execute that strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	1243	I have indicated to General Brown that uh - the words that he used in that interview, in that particular case and in several others, were very ill advised.	1
ClaimBuster	1244	I want to make more people like that woman, Lily Harden, so I've got a plan to do it, and it's just beginning.	0
ClaimBuster	1245	He said he did the right thing then, he knew it wouldn't work at the time.	1
ClaimBuster	1246	But if we're moving in the right direction and America is leading, we're better off.	0
ClaimBuster	1247	He also expressed the hope that there should be some understanding of the general situation in Berlin.	1
ClaimBuster	1248	But the best thing we can do now, Bob, given the circumstances with the company in England is for those of us who are younger and healthy, don't get a flu shot.	0
ClaimBuster	1249	We have a budget deficit in the federal government, but we also have an investment, a jobs, an income deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	1250	Allowing the new bill that was passed in the Congress made sense to allow for, you know, drugs that were sold overseas to come back and other countries to come back into the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	1251	But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA.	0
ClaimBuster	1252	It's a matter of being tough.	0
ClaimBuster	1253	And you're entitled to know where we would take this country if you decide to elect us.	0
ClaimBuster	1254	It's an enormous problem and corruption in official agencies, like militaries and police departments around the world, customs officials, that's one of the worst forms of it.	0
ClaimBuster	1255	He came in with a high growth rate, the 1990 budget agreement, which some, you know, didn't like, had some very tough cost controls, put a lot of pressure on Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	1256	I led the fight to put 100,000 cops on the streets of America.	1
ClaimBuster	1257	As a matter of fact, Mr. Bush was the Chairman of a task force on international terrorism which issued a report shortly before that decision was made and said, and rightly so, that we never ever can make concessions to terrorists and hostage takers.	1
ClaimBuster	1258	I think they're matters of very deep conviction, as far as many, many people in this country believe.	0
ClaimBuster	1259	Then you get what you want, and shouldn't you?	0
ClaimBuster	1260	So I just want to give a lot of things -- and just to respond.	0
ClaimBuster	1261	She has made bad judgment not only on taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	1262	And unfortunately again I regret this administration has not seized them and embraced them.	0
ClaimBuster	1263	We have the highest foreign debt in history.	1
ClaimBuster	1264	Let me tell you, if she's president of the United States, nothing's going to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	1265	And if it gets overturned, then we'll end up with marriage being defined by courts, and I don't think that's in our nation's interests.	1
ClaimBuster	1266	And that will lead to another five star migraine headache down the road.	0
ClaimBuster	1267	Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	1268	And we've probably got two and a half more million people who are not looking for jobs any more, because they've given up hope.	1
ClaimBuster	1269	There is a difference, though, as to what the economy has meant.	0
ClaimBuster	1270	Governor, the problem is, is that on a whole range of issues, whether it's the Middle East, whether it's Afghanistan, whether it's Iraq, whether it's now Iran, you've been all over the map.	0
ClaimBuster	1271	We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	1272	I'm caught in the middle on NAFTA.	1
ClaimBuster	1273	Again and again, on complex, difficult tasks, I have stayed the course.	0
ClaimBuster	1274	We have to have energy independence, so I've put forward a plan to make sure that, in 10 years' time, we have freed ourselves from dependence on Middle Eastern oil by increasing production at home, but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy, solar, wind, biodiesel, making sure that we're developing the fuel-efficient cars of the future right here in the United States, in Ohio and Michigan, instead of Japan and South Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	1275	We hadn't put al Qaeda to rest, and as a consequence, I thought that it was going to be a distraction.	0
ClaimBuster	1276	Let me tell you what your plan is.	0
ClaimBuster	1277	I argued that we should reverse that trend and take it back up.	1
ClaimBuster	1278	And we will do that.	0
ClaimBuster	1279	What he did in Moscow, that's fine.	0
ClaimBuster	1280	Ten years ago he served and I served on a school reform board that was funded by one of Ronald Reagan's former ambassadors and close friends, Mr. Annenberg.	1
ClaimBuster	1281	And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place.	1
ClaimBuster	1282	He's one of the wealthiest Americans, and he's our Vice President.	1
ClaimBuster	1283	I was just endorsed by ICE.	1
ClaimBuster	1284	So we ought to at least get the facts out here on the table so we can know where to go from here.	0
ClaimBuster	1285	I don't think the Fed ought to be put under the Executive Branch.	0
ClaimBuster	1286	I voted against that at the National Governors Association.	1
ClaimBuster	1287	He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	1288	We did try to bring Saddam Hussein into the family of nations; he did have the 4th largest army.	1
ClaimBuster	1289	Remains to be seen, however, whether or not there's going to be a political settlement in Kosovo, and I certainly hope there is one.	0
ClaimBuster	1290	Well, I think I did a much better job.	0
ClaimBuster	1291	We cannot do it any longer, Lester.	0
ClaimBuster	1292	And one last point I want to make about Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	1293	But now we have a chance.	0
ClaimBuster	1294	I've done a lot of them, and I'll continue to do them as president.	1
ClaimBuster	1295	And I need -- we need to have education and training programs for displaced workers that work, going to our community colleges.	0
ClaimBuster	1296	I don't believe in liberal activist judges.	0
ClaimBuster	1297	Small businessmen and businesswomen who paid 70 percent of your ninteen , your$265 billion tax increase, the largest tax increase in the history of America.	1
ClaimBuster	1298	I am going to help the inner cities.	0
ClaimBuster	1299	Wages and incomes have gone down.	1
ClaimBuster	1300	We still gave tax cuts to 15 million working Americans, and now I've got a plan that's been out there for two years, it could have been passed already, but instead the Republicans shut the government down to try to force their budget and their plan on me, and I couldn't take that.	1
ClaimBuster	1301	And Haitians have their problems, but we gave them a chance to restore democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	1302	The price of electricity is up.	1
ClaimBuster	1303	We've got to have a growing, expanding job base to give us a growing, expanding tax base.	0
ClaimBuster	1304	He's opposed every effort of every President to do so, and in the 4 years of his administration he's failed to do so.	1
ClaimBuster	1305	Veterans who've sacrificed for this country.	0
ClaimBuster	1306	You should know as much as possible about each of us.	0
ClaimBuster	1307	He'll tell you he's raised the money, and he has.	0
ClaimBuster	1308	But I will go out there and find men and women to interpret.	0
ClaimBuster	1309	They set a low standard of materialism.	0
ClaimBuster	1310	In the seven years before this Administration came into power in Washington, we found that six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain.	1
ClaimBuster	1311	And now what we have to do is to focus on those things we're real good at and make sure we're getting a fair deal.	0
ClaimBuster	1312	We've got to provide moral support to the Poles and Estonia and Latvia and all of the nations that were former Soviet satellites.	0
ClaimBuster	1313	Convert from 19th to 21st century capitalism.	0
ClaimBuster	1314	We have to make it the number one priority.	0
ClaimBuster	1315	Now what greater admission is there, 16 months afterwards.	0
ClaimBuster	1316	I think you know that these last four years haven't been so good as the president just described and that you don't feel like your confident that the next four years are going to be much better either.	0
ClaimBuster	1317	It really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have.	0
ClaimBuster	1318	My friends, we are not going to be able to provide the same benefit for present-day workers that we are going -- that present-day retirees have today.	0
ClaimBuster	1319	I give a new incentive for younger workers to save their own money and invest their own money, but not at the expense of Social Security, on top of Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	1320	And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or they'll be able to get a private plan.	0
ClaimBuster	1321	We can have enough clean energy to power every home.	1
ClaimBuster	1322	"They're not going to follow somebody who says, ""This is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time."""	0
ClaimBuster	1323	But before I answer further, let me thank you for moderating.	0
ClaimBuster	1324	It's like having a blueprint for a house you never built.	0
ClaimBuster	1325	We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty.	1
ClaimBuster	1326	Recognize -- I believe that Assad must go.	0
ClaimBuster	1327	What we need is good, strong leadership going in the next century.	0
ClaimBuster	1328	But let's sort of keep this out of politics because it's pretty dicey right now.	0
ClaimBuster	1329	223,000 kids in Arizona have no health insurance at all.	1
ClaimBuster	1330	And let's keep -- never forget the struggle that Americans are in today.	0
ClaimBuster	1331	But what I've also said is that now that you have a democratically elected government in Egypt, that they have to make sure that they take responsibility for protecting religious minorities.	1
ClaimBuster	1332	I wasn't happy when we found out there wasn't weapons, and we've got an intelligence group together to figure out why.	1
ClaimBuster	1333	But if they do -- if they do, it's easy to fix.	0
ClaimBuster	1334	And then in those nations, and on Arabic TV, you said that America had been dismissive and derisive.	1
ClaimBuster	1335	We both use similar language to reach an exactly opposite outcome.	0
ClaimBuster	1336	And if nothing else gets you excited about rebuilding our industrial base maybe that will because job one is to put our people back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	1337	You talk about women and women's rights?	0
ClaimBuster	1338	I have a plan to put America back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	1339	If we had a disaster today, could they handle it?	0
ClaimBuster	1340	And now we have half-a-trillion-dollar deficit annually.	1
ClaimBuster	1341	I haven't gotten a flu shot, and I don't intend to because I want to make sure those who are most vulnerable get treated.	1
ClaimBuster	1342	And many of the things the President talked about, he turned over to the United Nations.	0
ClaimBuster	1343	How is our credibility with the GCC countries on the Western side of the Gulf.	0
ClaimBuster	1344	Uh - We're using about fifty percent of our steel capacity today.	1
ClaimBuster	1345	Now, with respect to Darfur, yes, it is a genocide.	1
ClaimBuster	1346	If somebody came to you, Governor, with a plan that said, here, I want to spend $7 or $8 trillion, and then we're going to pay for it, but we can't tell you until maybe after the election how we're going to do it, you wouldn't take such a sketchy deal and neither should you, the American people, because the math doesn't add up.	0
ClaimBuster	1347	That's already offered in the private marketplace.	1
ClaimBuster	1348	I must remind him that we're at peace and during the period that he brags about unemployment being low, the United States was at war.	1
ClaimBuster	1349	We have got to stop sending jobs overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	1350	I'm not suggesting it will be done, but at least we ought to look at it.	0
ClaimBuster	1351	Well I would first say he should have been tackling it for the last seven years.	0
ClaimBuster	1352	I think we've got a lot more work to do.	0
ClaimBuster	1353	I did not say that.	1
ClaimBuster	1354	I said from the beginning that we ought to continue research into the strategic system at about the level that was added in 1983, that's about a billion dollars a year.	1
ClaimBuster	1355	"... extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, ""I can't do it."	0
ClaimBuster	1356	We do not have to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	1357	The defense budget today takes far less percentage of the gross national product than it did in President Kennedy's time, for example moved tremendously.	1
ClaimBuster	1358	It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.	0
ClaimBuster	1359	I've had the same test.	0
ClaimBuster	1360	We're going to have to develop clean coal technology and safe ways to store nuclear energy.	0
ClaimBuster	1361	You know, I fell off a platform out in California, Chico, a while back.	1
ClaimBuster	1362	But let me just say to all of America: if you hate people, I don't want your vote.	0
ClaimBuster	1363	No, no, no, but I could say, you know, that I ran a small grocery store on the corner, therefore I extrapolate that into the fact that I can run Wal-Mart.	1
ClaimBuster	1364	I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	1365	Somebody who understands that there're real Americans out there with real problems, whether soccer moms, or the single parents, the families or the seniors, or people with disabilities, whoever it may be.	0
ClaimBuster	1366	Look at the mess that we're in.	0
ClaimBuster	1367	How do you do it?	0
ClaimBuster	1368	Now, just back on this -- on this tax, you know, again, it's back to our first question here about rhetoric and record.	0
ClaimBuster	1369	It is -- it is a huge problem.	0
ClaimBuster	1370	You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	1371	Seventy-five percent of his people have been brought to justice.	1
ClaimBuster	1372	"They say, ""We feel like we're under attack from our own government."""	1
ClaimBuster	1373	I'm telling you, I will make it the -- I will make the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform bill the very first measure that I send to the Congress as president.	0
ClaimBuster	1374	These countries can't develop if young women are not given the kind of education that they need.	0
ClaimBuster	1375	Again, well it's, you are very selective, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	1376	The question is who makes the decision.	0
ClaimBuster	1377	And one of the areas, of course, is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil.	0
ClaimBuster	1378	We retained control as though we had sovereignty.	1
ClaimBuster	1379	We just had the election there.	1
ClaimBuster	1380	Because I was a senator with a Republican president.	1
ClaimBuster	1381	Barbara's sitting over here and I -- but what I have proposed, 10% cut, downsize the government, and we can get that done.	1
ClaimBuster	1382	And I'm sitting there and saying, well, who else could be around, you know?	0
ClaimBuster	1383	And that is, that we cannot look at this as simply a national problem.	0
ClaimBuster	1384	I am a graduate of the U.S.	1
ClaimBuster	1385	Bad health care at the most expensive price.	0
ClaimBuster	1386	It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.	0
ClaimBuster	1387	We need to expand our exports, and they're going very, very well, indeed.	0
ClaimBuster	1388	Before beginning my closing remarks, here, I would just like to remark a concern that I have that we have criticized the failures of the Carter policy here rather considerably, both of us this evening.	0
ClaimBuster	1389	In the same way that you say you would have ended the war in Iraq, but recently gave a speech saying that we should have 20,000 more folks in there.	1
ClaimBuster	1390	overlapping, aren't those the real costs?	0
ClaimBuster	1391	Let's take the example that the President cites.	0
ClaimBuster	1392	That's the enemy that was allowed to walk out of those mountains.	0
ClaimBuster	1393	The biggest complaint they have -- it's with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	1394	We have to stop the spending.	0
ClaimBuster	1395	And we're going to keep working to help Haiti...	0
ClaimBuster	1396	The control of these weapons is the single major responsibility of a President, and to cast out this commitment of all Presidents, because of some slight technicalities that can be corrected, is a very dangerous approach.	0
ClaimBuster	1397	I vetoed that bill because it cut more Medicare and and basically ran the risk of breaking up the system.	1
ClaimBuster	1398	I -- I don't know where John is getting his figures.	0
ClaimBuster	1399	Like the vice president, I call on Chairman Arafat to have his people pull back to make the peace.	1
ClaimBuster	1400	The first -- the first -- the first -- and we kept our schools number one in the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	1401	I understand in his last speech before the Steelworkers Union, that he changed that position and indicated that he felt that government seizure might be the best way to stop a strike which could not be settled by collective bargaining.	1
ClaimBuster	1402	Now, the final point I'll make on this whole issue of government intrusion and mandates -- it is absolutely true that I think it is important for government to crack down on insurance companies that are cheating their customers, that don't give you the fine print, so you end up thinking that you're paying for something and, when you finally get sick and you need it, you're not getting it.	0
ClaimBuster	1403	I think what it means to build consensus.	0
ClaimBuster	1404	And I think it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again.	0
ClaimBuster	1405	You know, this man has no credibility on the issue.	0
ClaimBuster	1406	You can't discriminate in the rights that you afford people.	0
ClaimBuster	1407	I can't protect an Arkansas company, you notice there, Governor.	0
ClaimBuster	1408	It denigrates an alliance to say we're going alone, to discount their sacrifices.	0
ClaimBuster	1409	And we'll find and we'll spend the money, research, to find the cause of autism.	0
ClaimBuster	1410	So we talk about all these new jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	1411	It would far surpass the numbers you mentioned.	1
ClaimBuster	1412	I'm saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs, and I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention.	0
ClaimBuster	1413	We have attempted to persuade Chiang Kai-shek as late as January of 1959 to reduce the number of troops he has on them.	1
ClaimBuster	1414	And most of the time, I learn it by asking her.	0
ClaimBuster	1415	The coal that the President mentioned - yes, we have it - and yet one-eighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at all right now.	1
ClaimBuster	1416	We're going to cut business taxes massively.	0
ClaimBuster	1417	So gun laws are important, no question about it, but so is loving children, and character education classes, and faith-based programs being a part of after-school programs.	0
ClaimBuster	1418	And using that base of strength, and using the idealism, the honesty, the predictability, the commitment, the integrity of our own country, that's where our strength lies.	0
ClaimBuster	1419	I'm absolutely convinced we can do it.	0
ClaimBuster	1420	I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under.	1
ClaimBuster	1421	And finally, number five, we've got to champion small business.	0
ClaimBuster	1422	We can't do it just in the schools.	0
ClaimBuster	1423	As for saving energy and conserving, the American people haven't been doing badly at that.	0
ClaimBuster	1424	Religion has been a huge part of my life.	0
ClaimBuster	1425	We're also going to have to have a farm more effective and comprehensive strategy to help move the world away from terror and Islamic extremism.	1
ClaimBuster	1426	But again, I did not hear a repudiation of Congressman...	0
ClaimBuster	1427	And I believe both a free Afghanistan and a free Iraq will serve as a powerful example for millions who plead in silence for liberty in the broader Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	1428	I have been a governor of a big state, I have made education my number one priority.	1
ClaimBuster	1429	And that's the way I've conducted myself as Governor of Texas and that's the way I'll conduct myself as President of the United States, should I be fortunate enough to earn your vote.	0
ClaimBuster	1430	Now, for three occasions, one after another, our Embassies were assaulted in the same way by a truck with demolitions.	1
ClaimBuster	1431	No, I don't believe it's going to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	1432	But then after the immediate action is taken, I believe the president has an obligation to tell the American people the truth and not wait eighteen months later for the report to be issued.	0
ClaimBuster	1433	It goes back to the founding of our country.	1
ClaimBuster	1434	How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county?	0
ClaimBuster	1435	We have the sources here.	0
ClaimBuster	1436	And you cannot keep both promises.	0
ClaimBuster	1437	You couldn't even have been a cardiologist because he had quotas.	0
ClaimBuster	1438	In the -- in the last women have lost 580,000 jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	1439	We will reform our military.	0
ClaimBuster	1440	Now, Joe, Senator Obama's plan, if you're a small business and you are able -- and your -- the guy that sells to you will not have his capital gains tax increase, which Senator Obama wants, if you're out there, my friend, and you've got employees, and you've got kids, if you don't get -- adopt the health care plan that Senator Obama mandates, he's going to fine you.	1
ClaimBuster	1441	The difference between where it is and 5.4 percent is 9 million Americans without work.	1
ClaimBuster	1442	So I'll get rid of that.	0
ClaimBuster	1443	As far as North Korea is concerned, our secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, went to North Korea.	1
ClaimBuster	1444	But any one that's here, we want to have more jobs here.	0
ClaimBuster	1445	But in any event, I understand the problems.	0
ClaimBuster	1446	And that is another way to help deal with the threats that we face in the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	1447	It means that the American buyer is getting a better bargain today because inflation is less.	1
ClaimBuster	1448	This is about American jobs and opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	1449	We will have secure borders, but we'll also have reform.	0
ClaimBuster	1450	I don't believe we ought to pay our bills through inflation, through a phony interest rate.	0
ClaimBuster	1451	For example, Germany will spend a trillion dollars building infrastructure over the next 10 years.	1
ClaimBuster	1452	And so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people.	1
ClaimBuster	1453	But the question is whether this other option proposed by the President should be pursued.	0
ClaimBuster	1454	Now, there's more work to do.	0
ClaimBuster	1455	That's been one of the hallmarks of my administration.	0
ClaimBuster	1456	I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and can't care for themselves are cared by -- by one another.	0
ClaimBuster	1457	And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth.	1
ClaimBuster	1458	Senator McCain's own campaign said publicly last week that, if we keep on talking about the economic crisis, we lose, so we need to change the subject.	1
ClaimBuster	1459	And when I'm president, we're going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond and we're going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in America for all corporations, 5 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	1460	Mine does not grow the government, it does not invest, have government invest.	0
ClaimBuster	1461	Let's give the money directly to students.	0
ClaimBuster	1462	What I'm saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws -- it's a great alternative to abortion -- continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs.	0
ClaimBuster	1463	Our funding for recovery is up, recovering the addicts.	1
ClaimBuster	1464	Let me tell you what I'm actually going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	1465	But the fact is that that's the situation that was left when I got there.	0
ClaimBuster	1466	But 2 former defense secretaries recently issued a report saying that 100,000 or slightly fewer troops would be enough, including President Reagan's former defense secretary, Mr. Carlucci.	1
ClaimBuster	1467	It's being used in 17 states right now.	1
ClaimBuster	1468	I also personally took responsibility tonight when Senator Dole asked me about the drug problem.	1
ClaimBuster	1469	I understand that both the - the uh - Department of State and the Defense Department have approved the accuracy of today's report, or yesterday's report, and also the National Security Agency.	1
ClaimBuster	1470	Now, maybe to some in this Bushnell Memorial that it's not a lot of money, but people watching tonight with a couple of kids, a working family, that's four or five months of day care, maybe a personal computer; it's may be three or four months of mortgage payments.	1
ClaimBuster	1471	And so one of the things that we've been doing is, is, for example, organizing entrepreneurship conferences with these Egyptians to give them a sense of how they can start rebuilding their economy in a way that's noncorrupt, that's transparent.	1
ClaimBuster	1472	And those are the stakes.	0
ClaimBuster	1473	For 30 years, you've been in a position to help, and if you say that I use steel or I use something else, I -- make it impossible for me to do that.	1
ClaimBuster	1474	They hired people -- they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.	1
ClaimBuster	1475	But I think what we want to avoid is falling back into this nationalized health care system that President Clinton wanted to give us in 1993.	1
ClaimBuster	1476	The American people asked me to get into it.	1
ClaimBuster	1477	And I ask for your support on November 8th.	0
ClaimBuster	1478	Your responsibility is to show up on November the 5th.	0
ClaimBuster	1479	Well, they sell us about this much stuff every year, and we sell them about this much stuff every year.	0
ClaimBuster	1480	If they did it by surprise...	0
ClaimBuster	1481	Found a boy -- excuse me, but this gives the flavor -- a boy in Houston kept a chicken in the bathtub in downtown Houston and missed 65 days going to livestock shows.	1
ClaimBuster	1482	In the Senate we passed the right of Americans to import drugs from Canada.	1
ClaimBuster	1483	Our priorities ought to be first of all to meet our own military needs, secondly to meet the needs of our allies and friends, and only then should we ship military equipment to foreign countries.	0
ClaimBuster	1484	My plan says that we want to raise marginal incomes on family incomes above $200,000 from 31 to 36 percent, that we want to ask foreign corporations simply to pay the same percentage of taxes on their income that American corporations play (sic) in America, that we want to use that money to provide over $100 billion in tax cuts for investment in new plant and equipment, for small business, for new technologies, and for middle class tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	1485	Uh - that would mean a cutback in the Soviet program; it would not interfere with our own program.	0
ClaimBuster	1486	I think it's the people's money.	0
ClaimBuster	1487	This is money out of that family's pocket.	0
ClaimBuster	1488	I - I'm strongly against a- abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	1489	I'm opposed to that, was opposed to it in October, 1958.	1
ClaimBuster	1490	It's put a lot of people out of business.	1
ClaimBuster	1491	By the way, I don't like to have the federal government start pushing its weight deeper and deeper into our schools.	0
ClaimBuster	1492	Senator Obama has never taken on his leaders of his party on a single issue.	1
ClaimBuster	1493	ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been opportunity to do so but this administration has failed to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	1494	"So let's have -- and let's have the American people say, ""Fix it for us."""	0
ClaimBuster	1495	China should go into North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	1496	When I took office, Haiti was governed by a dictator that had defied the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	1497	And all you hear about is how bad things are.	0
ClaimBuster	1498	They outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, who only a week earlier had been on the other side fighting against us, neither of whom trusted each other.	1
ClaimBuster	1499	And we have to change in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	1500	I see a man that took the leadership in the Job Training Partnership Act and that retrains people in this highly competitive changing society we're in, so if a person loses his hob he is retrained for a benefit-for a-work that will be productive and he won't have to go on one of these many programs that the liberal-talking about.	1
ClaimBuster	1501	In fact, the inspector general of the Justice Department found that John Ashcroft had twice applied it in ways that were inappropriate.	1
ClaimBuster	1502	As a nuclear engineer myself, I know the limitations and capabilities of atomic power.	0
ClaimBuster	1503	All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis.	0
ClaimBuster	1504	I'm going to close the loopholes that actually encourage companies to go overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	1505	There are forces there -- and that includes Syria, in my mind -- who don't want us to succeed, who don't want that kind of a peace with a dominant Lebanon, dominant over its own territory.	0
ClaimBuster	1506	And a free Iraq is going to make this world a more peaceful place.	0
ClaimBuster	1507	So when you look at the penalty that he paid, and when you analyze the requirements that I had - to spend all of my time working on the economy, which was in trouble, that I inherited; working on our problems in Southeast Asia - which were still plaguing us - it seemed to me that Mr. Nixon had been penalized enough by his resignation in disgrace and the need, and necessity for me to concentrate on the problems of the country fully justified the action that I took.	0
ClaimBuster	1508	I've admitted it when I make a mistake, but then I go on and help, try to solve the problems.	0
ClaimBuster	1509	But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	1510	I think that it's in better shape now than he generally does.	0
ClaimBuster	1511	I want to cut the size of the congressional staffs, but I think you're going to have too much influence there with people who were never elected, who have lots of expertise.	0
ClaimBuster	1512	And let's take the money that we've been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild America, roads, bridges schools.	0
ClaimBuster	1513	"So what's the message going to be: ""Please join us in Iraq."	0
ClaimBuster	1514	"He said, ""I don't know."	1
ClaimBuster	1515	Number 2, I think it would increase the influence of unelected staff members in the Congress who have too much influence already.	0
ClaimBuster	1516	But it's important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top.	0
ClaimBuster	1517	The other party gives them lip service.	0
ClaimBuster	1518	I believe in maintaining the strength of America's military.	0
ClaimBuster	1519	We're increasing defense reasonably -- not too much, but we are increasing defense some -- because we want to be prepared in case somebody here gets called up, Jason.	1
ClaimBuster	1520	But you know what we also need to do as Americans is never let the terrorists change the Constitution of the United States in a way that disadvantages our rights.	0
ClaimBuster	1521	We need to help people who are between jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	1522	Now, he talks about Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	1523	I care a lot about this.	0
ClaimBuster	1524	But I also promised that I'd fight every single day on behalf of the American people, the middle class, and all those who were striving to get into the middle class.	1
ClaimBuster	1525	The president always has the right, and always has had the right, for preemptive strike.	1
ClaimBuster	1526	Secondly, if you're a family of four making $50,000 in Massachusetts, you get a 50% tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	1527	I believe that the judges ought not to take the place of the legislative branch of government.	0
ClaimBuster	1528	It's going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.	0
ClaimBuster	1529	You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history.	1
ClaimBuster	1530	I will deal with them from day 1.	0
ClaimBuster	1531	He was the last communist party boss there and then he became a dictator that by some other label he was still essentially a communist dictator.	1
ClaimBuster	1532	But when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul.	1
ClaimBuster	1533	And you take a look at the people of Haiti.	0
ClaimBuster	1534	And the idea that my tax-cut proposal is inflationary: I would like to ask the President why is it inflationary to let the people keep more of their money and spend it the way that they like, and it isn't inflationary to let him take that money and spend it the way he wants?	0
ClaimBuster	1535	We're using the military more now in terms of interdiction.	1
ClaimBuster	1536	But if India does not succeed - with her four hundred and fifty million people, if she can't make freedom work - then people around the world are going to determine - particularly in the underdeveloped world - that the only way that they can develop their resources is through the Communist system.	0
ClaimBuster	1537	Respect the First Amendment, but I will do something to help you raise your kids without that garbage.	0
ClaimBuster	1538	I hear this talk about a blank check.	0
ClaimBuster	1539	And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq, because what our commanders have said is we don't have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	1540	Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we'll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is -- it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.	1
ClaimBuster	1541	Under my plan, if you make -- the top -- the wealthy people pay 62% of the taxes today.	1
ClaimBuster	1542	Now, those are the details as we have them.	0
ClaimBuster	1543	Oh, you didn't delete them?	0
ClaimBuster	1544	We can, with the participation of all Americans, work together and solve these problems together.	0
ClaimBuster	1545	Now, our real problem here is they both have plans that will not work.	0
ClaimBuster	1546	And it is unfortunate, it is a difficult area, no doubt about it.	0
ClaimBuster	1547	We became grandparents a year-and-a-half ago.	1
ClaimBuster	1548	And acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in World War II, we laid down the Marshall Plan, President Truman did.	1
ClaimBuster	1549	I know how to save billions.	0
ClaimBuster	1550	When you get 99.5 percent of the money, we don't know what happened to the other .5 percent, we're looking for it, somebody got it, but it all went to Democrats.	1
ClaimBuster	1551	The bankruptcies have gone up - uh in an extraordinary degree.	1
ClaimBuster	1552	I will do everything that I can to make sure that you have good jobs, with rising incomes, that your kids have good educations from preschool through college.	0
ClaimBuster	1553	The t- man who grows tomatoes - it costs less for those tomatoes than it does for the label on the can.	1
ClaimBuster	1554	Isn't providing housing for families of low and moderate income, isn't it making possible for young families, first time home buyers to own their own home some day something that's part of the American dream?	0
ClaimBuster	1555	Let's say, this isn't Democrat or Republican, and it isn't liberal or conservative.	0
ClaimBuster	1556	One important way of looking at this is to ask who are you going to fight for?	0
ClaimBuster	1557	So, we're trying to undo some of the things that your administration did.	0
ClaimBuster	1558	Well, I think they ought to look at us as a country that understands freedom where it doesn't matter who you are or how you're raised or where you're from, that you can succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	1559	Now I just want to make one last point because Senator McCain mentioned NAFTA and the issue of trade and that actually bears on this issue.	1
ClaimBuster	1560	This is a very important moment in the history of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	1561	We want people to be able to enjoy their lives and know they're going to have a bright and prosperous future, not be at war.	0
ClaimBuster	1562	But Senator Dole's plans are not good for the country.	0
ClaimBuster	1563	Uh - I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh - pay teachers' salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers' salaries - at least that's the way I read his remarks.	1
ClaimBuster	1564	As I say, I feel that we have a problem here to resolve.	0
ClaimBuster	1565	Thank you very, very much.	0
ClaimBuster	1566	It used to be the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	1567	I think it should stay in a lockbox, and I'll tell you this.	0
ClaimBuster	1568	So what I've said is, your first $250,000.00 worth of income, no change.	1
ClaimBuster	1569	And the way you get things done is bury yourselves in the room with one another, put together the best program, take it to the American people, use the electronic town hall, the kind of thing you're doing here tonight, build a consensus and then do it and then go on to the next one.	0
ClaimBuster	1570	I agree with the general statement Mr. Bush made.	0
ClaimBuster	1571	China is growing at 7 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	1572	I said I had no recollection whatsoever of talking with any of the White House legislative liaison people.	1
ClaimBuster	1573	To giving every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit and go out and get the health insurance you want rather than mandates and fines for small businesses, as Senator Obama's plan calls for.	1
ClaimBuster	1574	Our CHIPS program got a late start because our government meets only four months out of every two years, Mr. Vice President.	1
ClaimBuster	1575	It will probably have to be done by a commission.	0
ClaimBuster	1576	But I certainly would not impose any litmus test.	0
ClaimBuster	1577	And Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way.	0
ClaimBuster	1578	That's why we have the great migration.	0
ClaimBuster	1579	We now have 2500 hospices.	1
ClaimBuster	1580	That is all it says a simple guarantee of equality of opportunity which typifies the Democratic arty, and which is a very important commitment of mine, as contrasted with Governor Reagan's radical departure from the long-standing policy of his own party.	0
ClaimBuster	1581	There isn't any question but that we will defend Guantanamo if it's attacked.	0
ClaimBuster	1582	We need to have walk-in clinics.	0
ClaimBuster	1583	Someone called them something else.	0
ClaimBuster	1584	A lot of things happened which maybe shouldn't have happened.	0
ClaimBuster	1585	Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.	1
ClaimBuster	1586	If you don't want to take the offer of the plan that I want to put forward, you don't have do.	0
ClaimBuster	1587	And this is a safer country.	0
ClaimBuster	1588	So they don't have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000.	1
ClaimBuster	1589	But I will get back to the economic package because, again, I think this is very important.	0
ClaimBuster	1590	Because the 2% of the country that is involved in farming is important because the rest of us wouldn't eat except for them.	1
ClaimBuster	1591	And if we're asking for no revenue, then that means that we've got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff.	0
ClaimBuster	1592	My priority is going to be the health of our citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	1593	Mine for foreign affairs is democracy and freedom, and look at the dramatic changes around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	1594	You own this country but you have no voice in it the way it's organized now, and if you want to have a high risk experience, comparable to bungee jumping, go into Congress some time when they're working on this kind of legislation, when the lobbyists are running up and down the halls.	0
ClaimBuster	1595	In fact, this week we'll be carrying out the largest military exercise with Israel in history, this very week.	1
ClaimBuster	1596	We have huge difference between us on this question.	0
ClaimBuster	1597	The hardest decision a president makes is ever to use force.	0
ClaimBuster	1598	We had inflation of over 12 percent, we were on the brink of the worst recession in the last forty years, we were still deeply involved in the problems of Vietnam.	1
ClaimBuster	1599	Mr. Howe, Senator Kennedy, my fellow Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	1600	And then at that Democratic convention, they made a determination and they said there, ideology doesn't matter, just competence.	0
ClaimBuster	1601	But the reason for that is obvious.	0
ClaimBuster	1602	So there are some positive ways we can work on this.	0
ClaimBuster	1603	I repeat, within days after you made that pledge, you broke it; you said, well, maybe as a last resort we'll do it.	1
ClaimBuster	1604	It's a system that's got to be cleaned up.	0
ClaimBuster	1605	And today there's a memorial service for one of those that was lost in this tragedy.	1
ClaimBuster	1606	That's what we have here.	0
ClaimBuster	1607	I don't think that's the role of the president.	0
ClaimBuster	1608	I think the United States should have offered the opportunity to provide the nuclear fuel, test them, see whether or not they were actually looking for it for peaceful purposes.	0
ClaimBuster	1609	Now, if we're going to have another summit conference, there must be negotiations at the diplomatic level - the ambassadors, the Secretaries of State, and others at that level - prior to that time, which will delineate the issues and which will prepare the way for the heads of state to meet and make some progress.	0
ClaimBuster	1610	Now, keep in mind that our military spending has gone up every single year that I've been in office.	1
ClaimBuster	1611	It says that you can't gag a doctor, doctor can advise you.	0
ClaimBuster	1612	Governors like me and others have been trying to deal with the consequences.	0
ClaimBuster	1613	That means that we must continue to have a balanced budget here at home in every possible circumstance that we can; because the moment that we have loss of confidence in our own fiscal policies at home, it results in gold flowing out.	0
ClaimBuster	1614	But I will be a tolerant person.	0
ClaimBuster	1615	But we need much more than wind and solar.	0
ClaimBuster	1616	I'm sure every state in the union has got them.	1
ClaimBuster	1617	That -- that Detroit -- that Detroit answer...	0
ClaimBuster	1618	Compared to four years ago, we're clearly better off.	0
ClaimBuster	1619	And you know how you can trust me about that?	0
ClaimBuster	1620	We were able to drive our schools to be number one in the nation in my state.	1
ClaimBuster	1621	I was very interested to hear about Central America and our process down there, and I thought for a moment that instead of a debate I was going to find Mr. Mondale in complete agreement with what we're doing, because the plan that he has outlined is the one we've been following for quite some time, including diplomatic processes throughout Central America and working closely with the Contadora group.	1
ClaimBuster	1622	And, you know, there's always a reason for everything.	0
ClaimBuster	1623	But did I-did I sense a desire that maybe Lloyd Bentsen ought to be your running mate when you said there are three people on your ticket?	0
ClaimBuster	1624	There are only three left.	1
ClaimBuster	1625	Race remains a significant challenge in our country.	0
ClaimBuster	1626	And the -- the worst symptom on this disease is what my friend, Tom Coburn, calls earmarking as a gateway drug, because it's a gateway.	0
ClaimBuster	1627	He suggests that there are a number of other items in this whole depletion field that could be taken into account.	0
ClaimBuster	1628	It's not just that he has some of the best foreign policy credentials of anybody.	0
ClaimBuster	1629	Is there an equal time rule tonight?	0
ClaimBuster	1630	Ms. Golden, certainly the church has the right to take a position on moral issues.	0
ClaimBuster	1631	But the only uh - thing I uh - have pointed out was, what I've just said, and that there was a need to clarify the technicalities so that you couldn't be forced to release a person who was obviously guilty just because of a - of a small technicality in the law.	0
ClaimBuster	1632	It just takes good, strong leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	1633	That's kind of a pre-September 10th mentality, the hope that somehow resolutions and failed inspections would make this world a more peaceful place.	0
ClaimBuster	1634	And you hear all the bad stuff that's happened on my watch; I hope people will recognize that this is something pretty good for mankind.	0
ClaimBuster	1635	I agree with Mr. Bush that values are important.	0
ClaimBuster	1636	And that's going to be my job.	0
ClaimBuster	1637	Those are the kinds of priorities for national security and for foreign policy that I want to pursue Mr. Bush and I have major differences on these issues and I hope very much to be president and pursue them.	0
ClaimBuster	1638	Well, I think it's pretty liberal, I'll put that label on it.	0
ClaimBuster	1639	You tried it last time you ran.	1
ClaimBuster	1640	In this case when you murder somebody it's hate, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	1641	You have a raging debate about those plans.	0
ClaimBuster	1642	How strong are we going to be?	0
ClaimBuster	1643	We're also going to have our loan program, so that people are able to afford school.	0
ClaimBuster	1644	They don't like it when there's an unfair pounding and kind of hooting about people.	0
ClaimBuster	1645	The governor used the phrase phony numbers, but if you look at the plan and add the numbers up, these numbers are correct.	1
ClaimBuster	1646	But I would certainly not do first strike.	0
ClaimBuster	1647	And in 1985, he flew back from the West Coast to cut that COLA.	1
ClaimBuster	1648	There's a lot of pressures.	0
ClaimBuster	1649	Five hundred murders is a lot of murders.	0
ClaimBuster	1650	I'll lead you in an open and honest way, and I ask for your vote.	0
ClaimBuster	1651	Two-thirds of the country was a no-fly zone when we started this war.	1
ClaimBuster	1652	And I am also focussed on the fact that isn't it a paradox that we have the highest productivity in our workforce in the industrialized world and at the same time have the largest trade deficit, and at the same time rank behind 9 other nations in what we pay our most productive people in the world, and we're losing whole industries overseas.	1
ClaimBuster	1653	More countries in Asia voted against us on that question than voted with us.	1
ClaimBuster	1654	It's not going to be like the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	1655	Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks.	1
ClaimBuster	1656	Let me just say, Jim, you haven't heard the governor deny these numbers.	0
ClaimBuster	1657	I believe I know what this country ought to be.	0
ClaimBuster	1658	Let me begin by saying that my health-care plan is not what the president described.	0
ClaimBuster	1659	It's gone -- we have now presided over the largest increase in the size of government since the Great Society.	1
ClaimBuster	1660	I'm awfully glad you ge- got that question because as you know I got into it at the last of my other question and wasn't able to complete the argument.	0
ClaimBuster	1661	Governor Reagan is not responsible for what has happened over the last four years, nor am I.	0
ClaimBuster	1662	I've been a person that had been called a uniter, not a divider, because I accept other people's points of view.	0
ClaimBuster	1663	Would he have bombed Iran?	0
ClaimBuster	1664	One of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever.	1
ClaimBuster	1665	Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans' wages.	0
ClaimBuster	1666	But I would not want anyone to elect me uh - president of the United States - or vote for me - under the expectation that life would be easier if I were elected.	0
ClaimBuster	1667	Well, first of all, I admire Senator Kerry's service to our country.	0
ClaimBuster	1668	We cannot just say law and order.	0
ClaimBuster	1669	Why didn't she do something about it?	0
ClaimBuster	1670	He talks about the progress in the field of slum clearance and the like.	0
ClaimBuster	1671	So we can fight this war, and we can win this war.	0
ClaimBuster	1672	I think that there needs to be checks and balances in a democracy, and made that very clear that by consolidating power in the central government, he's sending a signal to the Western world and United States that perhaps he doesn't believe in checks and balances, and I told him that.	0
ClaimBuster	1673	You know, America's best days are ahead of us.	0
ClaimBuster	1674	But all I'm suggesting is let's not be naÃƒÂ¯ve in dealing with the Soviets and make a lot of unilateral cuts hoping against hope that they will match our bid.	0
ClaimBuster	1675	President Clinton did the same thing, because we have an obligation to protect you.	0
ClaimBuster	1676	So I say this is very simple.	0
ClaimBuster	1677	That's what it's meant to do.	0
ClaimBuster	1678	Sam Raybum had a great expression on this.	0
ClaimBuster	1679	And that's my biggest concern about my opponent.	0
ClaimBuster	1680	for a specific cause or a specific objective, come with such red tape, such priorities established by a bureaucracy in Washington, that the local government's hands are tied with regard to using that money as they feel could best be used, and for what they think might be the top priority.	0
ClaimBuster	1681	I believe we must meet our commitment to uh - Formosa.	0
ClaimBuster	1682	Again, that means not running big deficits here and not squandering our surplus.	0
ClaimBuster	1683	The best way to keep jobs here in America is, one, have an energy plan.	0
ClaimBuster	1684	So that's how I feel about it, and I think if we had the right kind of campaign reform, we'd get the changes you want.	0
ClaimBuster	1685	Just today I met with the presidents and the vice presidents of the Willow Run union here, near here.	1
ClaimBuster	1686	You're going to lose some deductions, and you can't buy the sales pitch.	0
ClaimBuster	1687	I'm convinced we'll do it.	0
ClaimBuster	1688	I suggest you pick a person who's successfully managed money.	0
ClaimBuster	1689	It's going to help those families, and it's going to create incentives to start growing jobs again in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	1690	Laos is moving in that direction.	1
ClaimBuster	1691	And these are the things you have to think through.	0
ClaimBuster	1692	We have increased oil production to the highest levels in 16 years.	1
ClaimBuster	1693	Those would all, could all be challenged by men.	0
ClaimBuster	1694	The President talks of Government programs, and they have their place.	0
ClaimBuster	1695	Well obviously my views are a little different.	0
ClaimBuster	1696	Now, on this issue of aiding Pakistan, if you're going to aim a gun at somebody, George Shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, you'd better be prepared to pull the trigger.	1
ClaimBuster	1697	And I grew up learning how to respect those views.	0
ClaimBuster	1698	I've had more people talk to me about their health care problems I guess than anything else, all across America -- you know, people who've lost their jobs, lost their businesses, had to give up their jobs because of sick children.	1
ClaimBuster	1699	And we want to encourage that.	0
ClaimBuster	1700	We have to turn around -- most schools are excellent, but we have to make sure that all of them are.	0
ClaimBuster	1701	And I don't hold it against him that he said grave threat.	0
ClaimBuster	1702	But I feel very strongly about that.	0
ClaimBuster	1703	And I believe I can.	0
ClaimBuster	1704	I want to double the dividend from $3,500 to $7,000 for every dependent child in America.	0
ClaimBuster	1705	I'm not going to cut her benefits or support any proposal that would.	0
ClaimBuster	1706	So there are differences but that's about the main area where I think we have a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	1707	But if our government itself is doing business with people who we know are engaged in drug profiteering and drug trafficking, if we don't understand that that sends out a very, very bad message to our young people, it's a little difficult for me to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that I talked about and to young people like her all over the country, and say to them we want to help you.	0
ClaimBuster	1708	And I want the states to meet their responsibilities.	0
ClaimBuster	1709	like a driver's license for new handguns and, you know, the Los Angeles --	0
ClaimBuster	1710	Could we do another round on it?	0
ClaimBuster	1711	I was joking with an old veteran friend, who joked with me, about Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	1712	So let's look at our record.	0
ClaimBuster	1713	He says, well, he's going to raise the taxes on the rich -- that's what he said -- the top two brackets.	1
ClaimBuster	1714	If you make bad investments, that's too bad.	0
ClaimBuster	1715	I talked to one of the leading former chiefs of Naval operations in my office a few weeks ago, who told me about 25,000 Chief Petty Officers being short.	1
ClaimBuster	1716	Doctors don't dare to deliver babies sometimes because they're afraid that somebody's going to sue them.	0
ClaimBuster	1717	One could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way.	0
ClaimBuster	1718	There's one for the people who have, and there's one for the people who don't have.	0
ClaimBuster	1719	I think this is the right strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	1720	But I will say as a Democrat, I was a real piker, Mr. President.	1
ClaimBuster	1721	A group of Arab scholars came together, organized by the U.N., to look at how we can help the -- the world reject these -- these terrorists.	1
ClaimBuster	1722	And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena.	1
ClaimBuster	1723	This is what the families of MIAs want.	0
ClaimBuster	1724	So we passed the Kassebaum-Kennedy, the Kennedy Kassebaum bill that will cover about 20 to 25 million people.	1
ClaimBuster	1725	It was turned over to the agency head of the CIA in Nicaragua to be printed.	1
ClaimBuster	1726	Under my tax plan that he continues to criticize, I set one-third.	1
ClaimBuster	1727	Under my plan it will be -- its solvency will be extended until you're 100.	0
ClaimBuster	1728	But the important thing is, if we suffer defeat in Iraq, which General Petraeus predicts we will, if we adopted Senator Obama's set date for withdrawal, then that will have a calamitous effect in Afghanistan and American national security interests in the region.	1
ClaimBuster	1729	And, finally, who would you give your pension fund and your savings account to manage?	0
ClaimBuster	1730	And the policy in Central America, regrettably, has failed because the Congress has been unwilling to support those who have been fighting for freedom.	1
ClaimBuster	1731	You've got to have the best intelligence in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	1732	So it seems to me instead of the anti-Washington feeling being aimed at everybody in Washington, it seems to me that the focus should be where the problem is, which is the Congress of the United States, and particularly the majority in the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	1733	I think we need to be more even-handed, as evidently 99 senators -- I think it was 99 senators supported that position.	1
ClaimBuster	1734	Our health program - the one that Senator Javits and other Republican Senators, as well as I supported - is one that provides for all people over sixty-five who want health insurance, the opportunity to have it if they want it.	1
ClaimBuster	1735	Democratic woman up there -- taking the lead in this.	0
ClaimBuster	1736	There is no way that the recovery is even across the country, just as in the depths of the recession, there were some parts of the country that were worse off, but some that didn't even feel the pain of the recession.	0
ClaimBuster	1737	That is the way it will stay.	0
ClaimBuster	1738	Let me just point out first of all this board that we're talking about can't make decisions about what treatments are given.	1
ClaimBuster	1739	Let me just tell you who the jury is.	0
ClaimBuster	1740	I've shown the American people I know how to lead.	0
ClaimBuster	1741	But I don't think we know the solution to global warming yet.	0
ClaimBuster	1742	Members of the clergy who have done the same.	0
ClaimBuster	1743	What I believe is we have to do, as the president mentioned towards the end of his remarks there, which is to make enormous efforts to enforce the gun laws that we have, and to change the culture of violence that we have.	0
ClaimBuster	1744	"You said, ""Look, I'm going to extend the tax policies that we have now; I'm not going to raise taxes on anyone, because when the economy is growing slow like this, when we're in recession, you shouldn't raise taxes on anyone."""	1
ClaimBuster	1745	I'm not discussing Whitewater now.	0
ClaimBuster	1746	Keep in mind that I and Americans took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able to, without putting troops on the ground at the cost of less than what we spent in two weeks in Iraq, liberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years.	1
ClaimBuster	1747	Right now, I meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college or if they're going to college, they are taking on $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $60,000 worth of debt, and it's very difficult for them to go into some fields, like basic research in science, for example, thinking to themselves that they're going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house.	1
ClaimBuster	1748	What things would I cut from spending?	0
ClaimBuster	1749	And yet the cash register's empty and it used to have our money, the taxpayers' money, in it, and we didn't get the results.	0
ClaimBuster	1750	I know a lot about that.	1
ClaimBuster	1751	Nikki, that's a question that's been raised by a lot of people around the country.	1
ClaimBuster	1752	And all of us are in this fight together, all of us care.	0
ClaimBuster	1753	One of the criteria that I think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved, if we can really make the difference with military forces.	0
ClaimBuster	1754	Now that's estimated to create 800,000 jobs, the problem is they won't be here, they'll be in places like China.	1
ClaimBuster	1755	I respect the sincerity which he m- which he makes that suggestion.	0
ClaimBuster	1756	But we'd like to have a Social Security fund that has about 70 years of life instead of about 30 years of life.	0
ClaimBuster	1757	Let me go back to the main point, Sandy.	0
ClaimBuster	1758	It has been blocked by a Senate in which there is a Democratic majority.	1
ClaimBuster	1759	So what is at test here is the credibility of the United States of America and how we lead the world.	0
ClaimBuster	1760	We're well ahead and we can stay ahead, provided we have confidence in America and don't run her down in order to build her up.	0
ClaimBuster	1761	He had two terms in the Senate, serving his second term.	1
ClaimBuster	1762	The entire press corps has looked at it.	1
ClaimBuster	1763	I will look at it at the time.	0
ClaimBuster	1764	There's a great young group, Lead or Leave, college students, young people, who don't want us to spend their money.	1
ClaimBuster	1765	And to do the job, you can't cut the money for it.	0
ClaimBuster	1766	That is absolutely not true.	0
ClaimBuster	1767	But what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision.	0
ClaimBuster	1768	He went to one meeting, and then we heard that he was stepping down.	1
ClaimBuster	1769	But Jesse Jackson is an independent person.	0
ClaimBuster	1770	We heard the same thing.	0
ClaimBuster	1771	I think people understand what she's saying.	0
ClaimBuster	1772	We ought to deal with each of these countries separately.	0
ClaimBuster	1773	I won't support judges like that.	0
ClaimBuster	1774	But I am uh - very glad to point out that since 1969, during a Republican administrations, we have had ten million people taken off of the tax rolls at the lower end of the taxpayer area.	1
ClaimBuster	1775	And I believe that we can bind our wounds.	0
ClaimBuster	1776	We did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems.	0
ClaimBuster	1777	You say that you're not interested in duplicating what happened in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	1778	But we're lawyers, I like lawyers.	1
ClaimBuster	1779	Costs will continue to spiral.	0
ClaimBuster	1780	The feelings are very strong.	0
ClaimBuster	1781	And eleven of 'em have been overridden.	1
ClaimBuster	1782	We can create millions of jobs in these new technologies- -more than we're going to lose in defense -- if we target it.	0
ClaimBuster	1783	And I know how to work with them.	0
ClaimBuster	1784	Now, I want to build the wall.	0
ClaimBuster	1785	But I'd like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I'm -- not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries.	1
ClaimBuster	1786	There are now over 2,000 more warheads pointed at us today than there were when he was sworn in, and that does not strengthen us.	1
ClaimBuster	1787	I know that Mr. Mondale, in the past, has made statements as if they were just people like ourselves, and if we were kind and good and did something nice, they would respond accordingly.	1
ClaimBuster	1788	About uh - late October of 1975, I asked the then Secretary of Defense, Mr. Schlesinger, to tell me what had to be done if we were going to reduce the defense budget by uh - three to five billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	1789	It also means we're helping them and small businesses to export all around the world to new markets.	1
ClaimBuster	1790	And the good thing about this is they'll be able to go across America.	0
ClaimBuster	1791	Well, it's pretty simple when they say: Are you for a ban on partial birth abortion?	0
ClaimBuster	1792	I will say this about Hillary.	0
ClaimBuster	1793	And therefore I've never suggested we should uh - be able to retire the debt substantially, or even at all in nineteen sixty-one or two.	1
ClaimBuster	1794	I will say this: that we will set as our goal a steady, gradual reduction of the deficit, which will require tough choices on spending; it will require a good strong rate of economic growth; it will require a plan that the president works out with the Congress doesn't blame them, works it out with them, which brings that deficit down; it will require us to go out and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren't being paid in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	1795	For a belief that law must be based on a higher law.	0
ClaimBuster	1796	And in this case I'm glad we did, because if we had let sanctions work and tried to build a consensus on that, Saddam Hussein today would be in Saudi Arabia controlling the world's oil supply, and he would be there maybe with a nuclear weapon.	0
ClaimBuster	1797	There's been too much finger pointing and too much name calling in Washington, D.C.	0
ClaimBuster	1798	You have a lot of it.	0
ClaimBuster	1799	And, last one, who would you ask to be the trustee of your estate and take care of your children if something happened to you?	0
ClaimBuster	1800	And, John, I -- you're absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say.	0
ClaimBuster	1801	I'd have confidence in him.	0
ClaimBuster	1802	I'm not aware of any program -- well, I'll just leave it at that.	0
ClaimBuster	1803	I don't think they'll look at us with envy.	0
ClaimBuster	1804	That's why I've focused on putting resources into solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal.	1
ClaimBuster	1805	You got a lot of women running for office.	0
ClaimBuster	1806	And we're struggling with that today.	0
ClaimBuster	1807	We cannot continue to afford -- she took that as saying nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	1808	Bear in mind that we have a lot of sanctions in force against Serbia right now.	1
ClaimBuster	1809	If you all want the enterprise zones, why don't we pass the dang thing and do it, right?	0
ClaimBuster	1810	And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	1811	Raise your hand if you're in managed care plan.	0
ClaimBuster	1812	All I'm going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it.	0
ClaimBuster	1813	But we had been digging our way out of policies that were misplaced and focused on the top doing very well and middle class folks not doing well.	1
ClaimBuster	1814	What's the net result of this?	0
ClaimBuster	1815	At the other extreme, uh - just 1 percent of the richest people in our country derive 25 percent of all the tax benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	1816	And I hope that will happen.	0
ClaimBuster	1817	But I believe that the next Administration should work for a balanced budget, and that would be my intention.	0
ClaimBuster	1818	If we don't have the best education system in the world, if we don't continue to put money into research and technology that will allow us to create great businesses here in the United States, that's how we lose the competition.	1
ClaimBuster	1819	When it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now.	0
ClaimBuster	1820	I immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable.	1
ClaimBuster	1821	There may be some moments when we use our troops as peacekeepers, but not often.	1
ClaimBuster	1822	And the reason that it's a problem to go shopping state by state, you know what insurance companies will do?	0
ClaimBuster	1823	And we kicked this man out of Kuwait.	1
ClaimBuster	1824	I don't want the American people to be confused.	0
ClaimBuster	1825	It was principled, and it was strategic.	0
ClaimBuster	1826	We're down 35,000 jobs in the private sector.	1
ClaimBuster	1827	And one of the consequences to allow parents to have different choices.	0
ClaimBuster	1828	Now, Senator McCain, the centerpiece of his economic proposal is to provide $200 billion in additional tax breaks to some of the wealthiest corporations in America.	1
ClaimBuster	1829	You've got stop-loss policies, so people can't get out when they were supposed to.	0
ClaimBuster	1830	Couple of service men here.	1
ClaimBuster	1831	Now the present Administration - the President - has said - never indicated what he thought of the 1954 decision.	1
ClaimBuster	1832	But what I would do first and foremost, is I would get in touch with the Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, to find out all the facts and all the circumstances.	0
ClaimBuster	1833	This goes on night and day.	0
ClaimBuster	1834	And I voted the same way that he did three months before in a national governors' conference.	1
ClaimBuster	1835	And I may have to make those tough decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	1836	But the best way to protect our citizens from guns is to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns.	0
ClaimBuster	1837	I guess the Vice President two or three times, said I was coming from the left.	1
ClaimBuster	1838	We have fought to try to raise the minimum wage in the last years.	1
ClaimBuster	1839	It's a great thing for the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	1840	The Congress is doing a better job of it.	0
ClaimBuster	1841	There is no question but that we cannot discuss our internal affairs in the United States without recognizing that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position.	0
ClaimBuster	1842	Because I believe it saves lives, Leo, I do.	0
ClaimBuster	1843	And that's what we've done.	0
ClaimBuster	1844	It's coming back now, so they can buy even more American products, and I think it will go down more.	0
ClaimBuster	1845	They would also know that we lived in a world with terrible weapons, nuclear weapons of terrible destructive power, aimed at each other, capable of crossing the ocean in a matter of minutes and destroying civilization as we knew it.	0
ClaimBuster	1846	It is a school full of so-called at-risk children.	1
ClaimBuster	1847	This kind of confusion and absence of leadership has let us drift now for two years with a constantly increasing threat of atomic weapons throughout the world.	0
ClaimBuster	1848	And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	1849	Well, I guess some may be better off.	0
ClaimBuster	1850	They will not let them see the written instructions given to Ambassador Glaspie.	0
ClaimBuster	1851	So, on the key issues that are of importance to American families, Joe Biden's always been on the right side, and I think he will make an outstanding president if, heaven forbid, something happened to me.	0
ClaimBuster	1852	But it is very important.	0
ClaimBuster	1853	"And he is also running on a platform that suggests a litmus test for the selection of judges - that only judges that hold a certain, quote, ""view,"" on the sanctity of family life, ought to be appointed to the Federal Judiciary, one of the three great independent branches of our Government."	1
ClaimBuster	1854	It's been growing about 12 percent per year over a long period of time.	1
ClaimBuster	1855	We may think that you deal with them in different ways.	0
ClaimBuster	1856	And then the Government of Lebanon asked us back in as a stabilizing force while they established a government and sought to get the foreign forces all the way out of Lebanon and that they could then take care of their own borders.	1
ClaimBuster	1857	Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.	1
ClaimBuster	1858	The neighborhood, the kind of environment people are growing up in, and that leads me to the programs I'm talking about in terms of education.	0
ClaimBuster	1859	I'm going to be able to balance the budget.	0
ClaimBuster	1860	So, I think we ought to do it in the Medicaid system.	0
ClaimBuster	1861	In giving our people better mental health care, we increased the number of employees.	1
ClaimBuster	1862	I'm going to do it in four years, and I'm going to immediately set out to have bilateral talks with North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	1863	When these Presidential Debates were held just four years ago, I remember the incumbent President, who was willing to debate, President Ford, telling the American people that they simply ought not to vote for somebody who promised more than they could deliver.	1
ClaimBuster	1864	We have a duty to protect our children and grandchildren.	0
ClaimBuster	1865	So if you've got $5,000 and it's going to cost you $12,000, that's a loss for you.	1
ClaimBuster	1866	And that means, yes, we still continue to open up new areas for drilling.	0
ClaimBuster	1867	And let's create jobs and let's get our economy going again.	0
ClaimBuster	1868	Health insurance premiums, up $2,500.	1
ClaimBuster	1869	You must have mandatory testing.	0
ClaimBuster	1870	All seniors are covered under prescription drugs in my plan.	1
ClaimBuster	1871	We all have tempers; I have one; I'm sure Senator Kennedy has one.	0
ClaimBuster	1872	There is a man here tonight named George McKinney from Milwaukee.	1
ClaimBuster	1873	I believe the people of this country can, and together, we can begin the world over again.	0
ClaimBuster	1874	Enforcement of law, and the federal government can help.	0
ClaimBuster	1875	The all- volunteer army works.	0
ClaimBuster	1876	It's either unfair for some or unfair for all.	0
ClaimBuster	1877	When the president had an opportunity to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, he took his focus off of them, outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, and Osama bin Laden escaped.	1
ClaimBuster	1878	The secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating.	1
ClaimBuster	1879	For instance, in the Transportation Department uh we had uh - we cut back about 25 percent of the total number of employees.	1
ClaimBuster	1880	Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit, and one of the things I'm sure we'll be discussing tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code?	0
ClaimBuster	1881	But part of it is also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these communities and making sure we catch violent impulses before they occur.	0
ClaimBuster	1882	There was one good thing that came out of that budget agreement, and that is we put a cap on discretionary spending.	1
ClaimBuster	1883	We've had enough of that, ladies and gentlemen.	0
ClaimBuster	1884	But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.	0
ClaimBuster	1885	And today, without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission, we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems.	1
ClaimBuster	1886	It's being fought primarily in Asia, in Africa, and in Latin America.	1
ClaimBuster	1887	But I believe -- we want to make sure that we have the relationships of friendship with the people that take his place, steps that in the years to come we see Syria as a -- as a friend, and Syria as a responsible party in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	1888	But I don't believe in these changing and revolutionary times this Administration has known that the world is changing - has identified itself with that change.	0
ClaimBuster	1889	So I think he's a bit taller than I am.	0
ClaimBuster	1890	I'm much more optimistic about this country than some.	0
ClaimBuster	1891	"We said, ""All right, if that's what you want to do.''"	0
ClaimBuster	1892	I don't want the government financing congressional elections.	0
ClaimBuster	1893	I've stood up and told the American people that I think it's a real problem, that it can destroy long-term economic growth, and I've told you what I think should be done.	0
ClaimBuster	1894	The economy is slowing down, so it's hard to anticipate right now what the budget is going to look like next year.	1
ClaimBuster	1895	No wonder you've been fighting -- no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.	1
ClaimBuster	1896	President Clinton opposes term limits, President Clinton opposes a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	1897	I think bipartisanship is a national asset.	0
ClaimBuster	1898	We could have gained if they did it by surprise.	0
ClaimBuster	1899	But we have got to reform government.	0
ClaimBuster	1900	And we spent some time, and we said a prayer and, remarkably, about two months later, this young man and his mom showed up, and he looked unbelievable, good as new.	1
ClaimBuster	1901	We've run up more debt in the last eight years than under all the presidents from George Washington to Jimmy Carter combined.	1
ClaimBuster	1902	It sounds like the vice presidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not right very many times tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	1903	He says on the one hand I am for it and on the other hand I may be against it.	1
ClaimBuster	1904	I've got a little ways to go before I start doing that.	0
ClaimBuster	1905	"And there was a huge poster of Vladimir Putin, and it said, ""Vladimir Putin, our president."""	1
ClaimBuster	1906	You have to gut it out, issue by issue by issue.	0
ClaimBuster	1907	But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform.	0
ClaimBuster	1908	And I'll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal.	1
ClaimBuster	1909	So I would send two to three additional brigades to Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	1910	These appointments are for life.	0
ClaimBuster	1911	You know my opinion on North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	1912	In the White House staff itself, when I became president, we had roughly five hundred and forty employees.	1
ClaimBuster	1913	The president wants to do well.	0
ClaimBuster	1914	We know better how to do it in California or Texas or wherever it is.	0
ClaimBuster	1915	I believe in strict constructionists.	0
ClaimBuster	1916	And you said we should ask Pakistan for permission.	0
ClaimBuster	1917	We need to make sure our seniors get the promise made.	0
ClaimBuster	1918	You all know me, and we've held it back a little.	0
ClaimBuster	1919	Number two, if you don't have health insurance, we're essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if you're out there trying to get insurance on the individual market.	1
ClaimBuster	1920	Because if we do not and SALT I expires on October three, 1977, you will unleash again an all-out nuclear arms race with the potential of a nuclear holocaust of unbelievable dimensions.	1
ClaimBuster	1921	We sort of seem to have a desire to try to stay over there and control it.	0
ClaimBuster	1922	The armed forces, the conventional forces of the United States have never been more ready.	0
ClaimBuster	1923	I think what is misleading is to say you can lead and succeed in Iraq if you keep changing your positions on this war.	0
ClaimBuster	1924	"And they looked me in the eye and said, ""Yes, sir, Mr."	1
ClaimBuster	1925	The auto emissions - uh - it was agreed by Leonard Woodcock, the head of the UAW, and by the uh - heads of all of the automobile industry, we had labor and management together saying that those auto emission standards had to be modified.	1
ClaimBuster	1926	But I have lived the American dream.	0
ClaimBuster	1927	And, by the way, this was a proposal made by Senator Clinton not too long ago.	1
ClaimBuster	1928	That's exactly what our budget does, and it also then allows us to reduce our deficit, which is a significant national security concern.	1
ClaimBuster	1929	It's the only reason to be for it.	0
ClaimBuster	1930	You're cutting back on maintenance and equipment.	0
ClaimBuster	1931	Their budget cut enforcement for the Environmental Protection Agency by a third.	1
ClaimBuster	1932	That meant immediately 46% of your people that were signing up had no reason for signing up.	1
ClaimBuster	1933	So we can make changes in the way our culture works to help bring people away from violence and give them opportunity, and bring them in the American system.	0
ClaimBuster	1934	The question before us is: which point of view and which party do we want to lead the United States?	0
ClaimBuster	1935	And there were a series of recommendations, as I recall, more than 40.	1
ClaimBuster	1936	Now, four years ago, when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families.	1
ClaimBuster	1937	Sometimes we - we get the opinion that in getting programs through the House or the Senate it's purely a question of legislative finagling and all that sort of thing.	0
ClaimBuster	1938	The wealthiest Americans have been taxed much less, even though their incomes have gone up.	1
ClaimBuster	1939	Mr. Edwards, I don't think it's a wise idea for presidential candidates to appoint the members of his cabinet prospectively, or to suggest four people - indicate that one of them surely will be appointed.	0
ClaimBuster	1940	Of course that's a charge that's always made against any governor who runs for the presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	1941	There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once.	1
ClaimBuster	1942	Now we can talk about Putin.	0
ClaimBuster	1943	We have devoted ourselves to our children and now our nearly one-and-a-half-year-old grandson.	1
ClaimBuster	1944	Devastated states like California and others.	0
ClaimBuster	1945	But as governor, when I was at that end of the line and receiving some of these grants for Government programs, I saw that so many of them were dead-end.	0
ClaimBuster	1946	I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home.	0
ClaimBuster	1947	And the fact that you're going to college is great, but I want everybody to get a great education and we've worked hard to make sure that student loans are available for folks like you, but I also want to make sure that community colleges are offering slots for workers to get retrained for the jobs that are out there right now and the jobs of the future.	1
ClaimBuster	1948	That was the right place.	0
ClaimBuster	1949	When the Republican platform says that from here on out, we're going to have a religious test for judges before they're selected for the Federal court, and then Jerry Falwell announces that that means they get at least two Justices of the Supreme Court, I think that's an abuse of faith in our country.	1
ClaimBuster	1950	I think we've seen a deterioration of values.	0
ClaimBuster	1951	And it's actually an accounting treatment, as you know, that's been in place for a hundred years.	1
ClaimBuster	1952	And if you do the math, those people who have employer-based health benefits, if you put the tax on it and you have what's left over and you add $5,000 that you're going to get as a refundable tax credit, do the math, 95 percent of the American people will have increased funds to go out and buy the insurance of their choice and to shop around and to get -- all of those people will be covered except for those who have these gold-plated Cadillac kinds of policies.	1
ClaimBuster	1953	And you can't say, because Saddam might have done it 10 years from now, that's a reason; that's an excuse.	0
ClaimBuster	1954	We've got two and a half million more Americans out of work now than we had when Mr. Ford took office.	1
ClaimBuster	1955	With all due respect to President Ford, I think he ought to be ashamed of mentioning that statement, because we have the highest unemployment rate now than we had at any time between the Great Depression caused by Herbert Hoover and the time President Ford took office.	1
ClaimBuster	1956	When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.	0
ClaimBuster	1957	Governor Clinton says $200,000 but he also says he wants to raise $150 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	1958	The first thing you did when you came into office was set up the stimulus package, said we've got a little pork we want to scatter around America, $16 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	1959	Pam, what the president didn't tell you is all his tax cuts expire the year 2000, but these increases go on forever.	1
ClaimBuster	1960	And they can look at my track record, whether it's Iran sanctions, whether it's dealing with counterterrorism, whether it's supporting democracy, whether it's supporting women's rights, whether it's supporting religious minorities.	0
ClaimBuster	1961	These are folks who've worked hard, like my grandmother, and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this.	0
ClaimBuster	1962	I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not -- who work full-time should not still be in poverty.	0
ClaimBuster	1963	We cannot send our people all over the world to solve every problem that comes up.	0
ClaimBuster	1964	We can know who the people are, that they're really the people they say they are when they cross the border.	0
ClaimBuster	1965	Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who's gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary.	1
ClaimBuster	1966	I believe that if we ask those questions that bear on our future, not just congratulate ourselves but challenge us to solve those problems, you'll see that we need new leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	1967	The matter of Somoza -- no, I never defended Somoza.	1
ClaimBuster	1968	The governor mentioned it earlier.	1
ClaimBuster	1969	And it's also unfair to dump these tremendous bills on our children.	0
ClaimBuster	1970	You were trying to defend your cut which was not a cut either, Reduction in the growth of spending.	0
ClaimBuster	1971	Listen, for 24 years I have never been afraid to take on the big drug companies.	1
ClaimBuster	1972	Some schools aren't even safe.	1
ClaimBuster	1973	Again, we've got plans lying all over the place in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	1974	Let me make my position cl ear.	0
ClaimBuster	1975	My grandmother died three days before I was elected president.	1
ClaimBuster	1976	I have a tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	1977	Well, Bob, you asked me a direct question.	1
ClaimBuster	1978	Maybe we will talk about some more before it's over.	0
ClaimBuster	1979	But we are there, and I think this insurance policy is necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	1980	I have no businesses there.	1
ClaimBuster	1981	In other words, in order to make sure we're secure, there must be a comprehensive plan.	0
ClaimBuster	1982	Well, they should look at our proposals and look at us as people and make up their own minds.	0
ClaimBuster	1983	But, of course, if you're a small business or a mom-and-pop business or a big business starting up here, you've got to pay even the reduced rate that Governor Romney's talking about.	1
ClaimBuster	1984	And they showed solidarity with them, but, also, they are very concerned about the Russian threats to regain their status of the old Russian to regain their status of the old Russian empire.	0
ClaimBuster	1985	I don't think we should have that kind of a program.	0
ClaimBuster	1986	And I look very, very much forward to doing it.	0
ClaimBuster	1987	You've got to go to the people.	0
ClaimBuster	1988	This is facts -- that would have given investment tax credits and other incentives to reinvest in our cities, in our country.	0
ClaimBuster	1989	I first want to say the President didn't quite give you all of the stuff on the quotas, because the Justice Department had what we called the Piscataway case up in New Jersey.	1
ClaimBuster	1990	And those two principles can now be applied to conventional forces, to strategic forces, provided	0
ClaimBuster	1991	I would like to have one in this race, come to think of it, but I don't get one.	0
ClaimBuster	1992	I think it's uh - also appropriate to point out that through our tax policies we have stimulated uhh - added employment throughout the country, the investment tax credit, the tax incentives for expansion and modernization of our industrial capacity.	0
ClaimBuster	1993	Somebody who sits in Washington, D.C., eighteen months after the Mayaguez incident, can be a very good grandstand quarterback.	0
ClaimBuster	1994	And I think it's so important -- one of the most important things we can do.	0
ClaimBuster	1995	Should they pay more for Social Security if they get more out of it than they paid in, they're upper income people?	0
ClaimBuster	1996	Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he's supporting for president.	0
ClaimBuster	1997	And Senator Obama, who after promising not to vote to cut off funds for the troops, did the incredible thing of voting to cut off the funds for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	1998	Why do we have to do it?	0
ClaimBuster	1999	I believe if we find poor children trapped in schools that won't teach, we need to free the parents.	0
ClaimBuster	2000	I don't believe we need a good judge of that kind of definition on either side.	0
ClaimBuster	2001	But I just know how this world works, and that in the councils of government, there must be certainty from the U.S. president.	0
ClaimBuster	2002	It can only be done in two ways: one, to conserve energy - to stop the waste of energy - and, secondly, to produce more American energy.	0
ClaimBuster	2003	I don't know, I'm not questioning anybody.	0
ClaimBuster	2004	And so I think that we're on the right track.	0
ClaimBuster	2005	Secondly, we need a guest-worker program, but if it's all we have, it's not going to solve the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	2006	And yes, we've got too many taxes on the American people and we're spending too much.	1
ClaimBuster	2007	But one thing I would say where diplomacy is concerned, Israel should feel absolutely secure about one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	2008	It doubles about every -- every five or so years.	1
ClaimBuster	2009	I'm not satisfied with it even if there were no Communism in the world, but particularly when we're in the kind of a race we're in, we have got to see that America grows just as fast as we can, provided we grow soundly.	0
ClaimBuster	2010	And Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that's OK, we can't force it into their country.	1
ClaimBuster	2011	So if we are going to be serious about this issue, we've got to have a president who is going to tackle it head-on.	0
ClaimBuster	2012	Now, what can I bring to that challenge?	0
ClaimBuster	2013	These are American citizens, we care deeply about them.	0
ClaimBuster	2014	We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored.	0
ClaimBuster	2015	I favor it not because I want to make a lot of oil men rich, but because I want to make America rich.	0
ClaimBuster	2016	When I made my decision to stop all trade with Iran as a result of the taking of our hostages, I announced then, and have consistently maintained since then, that if the hostages are released safely, we would make delivery on those items which Iran owns - which they have bought and paid for - also, that the frozen Iranian assets would be released.	1
ClaimBuster	2017	He's been traveling in some other country.	1
ClaimBuster	2018	What I said was the same thing that the audience here today heard me say, which is, if Pakistan is unable or unwilling to hunt down bin Laden and take him out, then we should.	1
ClaimBuster	2019	I will knock the hell out of ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	2020	Thirdly, on medical care for the aged, this is the same fight that's been going on for twenty-five years in Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	2021	Because under the last four years, they've been buried.	1
ClaimBuster	2022	It's not dirty campaigning because he's been talking about my record for a half a year here, 11 months here.	1
ClaimBuster	2023	I believe it my responsibility as the leader of the Democratic party in 1960 to try to warn the American people that in this crucial time we can no longer afford to stand still.	0
ClaimBuster	2024	No, I don't think there is.	0
ClaimBuster	2025	I believe that Ronald Reagan, John Kennedy, and the others did that more effectively, and I'm going to try to follow in their footsteps.	0
ClaimBuster	2026	His political opposition is being put in jail.	1
ClaimBuster	2027	These are places where people can get primary care.	1
ClaimBuster	2028	But I've got a better idea.	0
ClaimBuster	2029	And so the person you talked to, I say, here's some help, here's some trade adjustment assistance money for you to go a community college in your neighborhood, a community college which is providing the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	2030	But we also have to take demand seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	2031	And by working and coordinating our efforts together, not threatening to attack them, but working with them, and where necessary use force, but talk softly, but carry a big stick.	0
ClaimBuster	2032	And Governor Romney's says he's got a five-point plan?	0
ClaimBuster	2033	And there is no system.	0
ClaimBuster	2034	The recession that resulted this time was the briefest since the Second World War.	1
ClaimBuster	2035	We have to work more closely with our allies.	0
ClaimBuster	2036	Joe has always made sure that he is fighting on behalf of working families, and I think he shares my core values and my sense of where the country needs to go.	0
ClaimBuster	2037	Free trade with Colombia is something that's a no-brainer.	0
ClaimBuster	2038	And I was proud of that.	0
ClaimBuster	2039	I've reached the conclusion, too, based on the reports that have been made, that they may be cheating.	0
ClaimBuster	2040	We need to invest and grow, and that's what I want to do.	0
ClaimBuster	2041	They sell a lot of automobiles here, create a lot of jobs -- those who sell exports.	1
ClaimBuster	2042	And I said, well, I'll tell you.	0
ClaimBuster	2043	I think the American people are ready for action.	0
ClaimBuster	2044	I think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education -- on excellence in education.	1
ClaimBuster	2045	One way or the other, they're wrapped up in it.	0
ClaimBuster	2046	And when it comes to our economy here at home, I know what it takes to create 12 million new jobs and rising take-home pay.	0
ClaimBuster	2047	Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel.	1
ClaimBuster	2048	Charter schools, I doubled the number of charter schools in Illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions.	1
ClaimBuster	2049	You all just heard my plan.	1
ClaimBuster	2050	I do not, very frankly, take seriously the Congressional Budget Office projections, because they have been wrong on virtually all of them, including the fact that our recovery wasn't going to take place to begin with.	0
ClaimBuster	2051	In the old days we'd see a threat, and we could deal with it if we felt like it or not.	0
ClaimBuster	2052	We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her.	0
ClaimBuster	2053	War has been the constant companion of mankind, so to have these weapons disseminated around the world, I believe means that we're going to move through a period of hazard in the next few years.	0
ClaimBuster	2054	All of this can be cured and all of it can be solved.	0
ClaimBuster	2055	I like the fact that in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together.	1
ClaimBuster	2056	But here again, I don't know which George Bush I'm listening to.	0
ClaimBuster	2057	We do those things, not only is your future going to be bright but America's future is going to bright as well.	0
ClaimBuster	2058	And it will be fun if we all work together to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	2059	They have to make sure that they're cooperating with us when it comes to counterterrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	2060	We have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads right now on land, on sea and in the air, enough to blow up the Soviet Union forty times over.	1
ClaimBuster	2061	All those changes in our tax code would make a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	2062	That extends the life of Social Security for 55 years.	1
ClaimBuster	2063	One of the areas, and of course the most vulnerable area is - I have felt, has been Eastern Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	2064	I want to get to Medicare in a second.	0
ClaimBuster	2065	He claims it will be out of Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	2066	If I may take the bills, we did pass in the Senate a bill uh - to provide a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage.	1
ClaimBuster	2067	The breach on the agreement is highly enriched uranium.	1
ClaimBuster	2068	Number 3, if the people really have a mind to change, they can.	0
ClaimBuster	2069	I love the optimism in that painting, because that's how I feel about America.	0
ClaimBuster	2070	I want you to know I care passionately about this and I will fight until it becomes law.	0
ClaimBuster	2071	He hasn't had help from the administration, from the Congress, to carry this out.	1
ClaimBuster	2072	We're becoming more and more of a melting pot.	0
ClaimBuster	2073	Well, if it's in our vital national interests, and that means whether our territory is threatened or people could be harmed, whether or not the alliances are -- our defense alliances are threatened, whether or not our friends in the Middle East are threatened.	0
ClaimBuster	2074	Wages are goings up for the first time in a decade.	1
ClaimBuster	2075	My opponent just said something amazing.	0
ClaimBuster	2076	It runs a minimum of thirteen and two-tenths billions dollars a year more than we are presently spending to a maximum of eighteen billion dollars a year more than we're presently spending.	1
ClaimBuster	2077	Now it seems to me that uh - as we look at the recommendations of the budget committees and our own projections, there isn't going to be any $60 billion dividend.	1
ClaimBuster	2078	Now as far as President Eisenhower is concerned, I have often heard him discuss this question.	1
ClaimBuster	2079	They don't want to see protectionism.	0
ClaimBuster	2080	So it isn't worth the paper it's printed on.	0
ClaimBuster	2081	We've got to grow the economy by putting people first -- real people like you.	0
ClaimBuster	2082	I don't think the American people are getting their money's worth from the majority party that run this Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	2083	The Administration has vetoed that bill passed by the Congress twice.	1
ClaimBuster	2084	It means that the United States must have a strong diplomatic hand with our friends in NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	2085	I know we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America.	0
ClaimBuster	2086	And that's what I did, sir.	1
ClaimBuster	2087	I believe in building safe zones.	0
ClaimBuster	2088	He is for full public financing of Congressional elections.	1
ClaimBuster	2089	But, you see, my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible.	0
ClaimBuster	2090	We went into Russia, we said here is some IMF money, and it ended up in Viktor Chemomyrdin's pocket, and others, and yet we played like there was reform.	1
ClaimBuster	2091	I'm not running for the Presidency because I believe that I can solve the problems we've discussed tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	2092	Could I respond to that, Jim?	0
ClaimBuster	2093	Yes, we had grain credits for Iraq, and there isn't any evidence that those grain credits were diverted into weaponry -- none, none whatsoever.	1
ClaimBuster	2094	There are great public schools where there's public school choice, accountability and brilliant principals.	0
ClaimBuster	2095	Mostly that's just me opposing George Bush's wrong headed policies since I've been in Congress but I think it is that it is also important to recognize I worked with Tom Coburn, the most conservative, one of the most conservative Republicans who John already mentioned to set up what we call a Google for government saying we'll list every dollar of federal spending to make sure that the taxpayer can take a look and see who, in fact, is promoting some of these spending projects that John's been railing about.	1
ClaimBuster	2096	We're not going to touch Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	2097	Nobody wants gridlock anymore, and so let's get the program through.	0
ClaimBuster	2098	The key is whether or not we've got priorities that are working for you as opposed to those who have been dictating the policy in Washington lately, and that's mostly lobbyists and special interests.	1
ClaimBuster	2099	Now, the G-8 is one of those, but there are many others.	1
ClaimBuster	2100	And we paid down the debt of our nation for two years in a row, and we created 23 million new jobs at the same time.	1
ClaimBuster	2101	And he said the mark of a good judge, good justice, is that when you're reading their decision, their opinion, you can't tell if it's written by a man or woman, a liberal or a conservative, a Muslim, a Jew or a Christian.	0
ClaimBuster	2102	We need to put the responsibilities back on the cabinet members.	0
ClaimBuster	2103	They don't vote for war.	0
ClaimBuster	2104	Now, specifically, one, on Medicare, it is not true that everyone knows how to fix it.	0
ClaimBuster	2105	Let me do first on a personal level.	0
ClaimBuster	2106	Part of it is seeing if we can get automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.	0
ClaimBuster	2107	They analyzed the senator's plan.	1
ClaimBuster	2108	She understands that autism is on the rise, that we've got to find out what's causing it, and we've got to reach out to these families, and help them, and give them the help they need as they raise these very special needs children.	1
ClaimBuster	2109	Now when they talk about our record here, it is well that they recognize that they have to stand up for their record as well.	0
ClaimBuster	2110	The anti-Washington feeling, in my opinion, ought to be focused on the Congress of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	2111	Now, I hope people understand that Medicare today is important, but it doesn't keep up with the new medicines.	0
ClaimBuster	2112	Who has the experience that we trust?	0
ClaimBuster	2113	We've had 25 years of very good cooperation.	1
ClaimBuster	2114	Either they provide health insurance to their employees or somebody has to.	0
ClaimBuster	2115	Please don't get into the Washington Post.	0
ClaimBuster	2116	It's another to be certain and be right, or to be certain and be moving in the right direction, or be certain about a principle and then learn new facts and take those new facts and put them to use in order to change and get your policy right.	0
ClaimBuster	2117	That was a great doctrine throughout the Cold War.	0
ClaimBuster	2118	This affects human beings, and - and his insensitivity in providing those people a chance to work has made this a welfare administration, and not a work administration.	0
ClaimBuster	2119	The constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she had been raped or suffered from incest.	1
ClaimBuster	2120	Governor Clinton has to operate under a balanced budget amendment -- he has to do it, that is the law.	1
ClaimBuster	2121	And I will be a good president.	0
ClaimBuster	2122	The question now is: Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack - attack it has ever known?	0
ClaimBuster	2123	And I think the three of us have one view and the Governor has another view.	0
ClaimBuster	2124	The president wants it, but we can't get it because we sit here in gridlock because it's a campaign year.	0
ClaimBuster	2125	I'm not satisfied when I see men like Jimmy Hoffa - in charge of the largest union in the United States - still free.	1
ClaimBuster	2126	He would actually have to cut Government spending by at least $130 billion in order to balance the budget under this ridiculous proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	2127	I did give about six months before the effective date of the act before lawsuits can actually be filed, even though they're effective now, and can be legally binding, because I want to change Cuba.	1
ClaimBuster	2128	He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.	1
ClaimBuster	2129	Even though I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them.	1
ClaimBuster	2130	And with that thought, I realized what a job I had with that letter.	0
ClaimBuster	2131	We think that's pretty good progress.	0
ClaimBuster	2132	I will never send troops anywhere on a mission of that kind without telling them that if somebody shoots at them, they can darn well shoot back.	0
ClaimBuster	2133	I oppose it for the reasons that I mentioned.	0
ClaimBuster	2134	Right, thank you for that.	0
ClaimBuster	2135	I have laid out a different plan, because the president's plan is not working.	0
ClaimBuster	2136	And there are several there's a good political reason because it's just about this time of year that the Democrats start saying the Republicans are going to take away your Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	2137	They've got to turn off the TV set, put away the video games, and, finally, start instilling that thirst for knowledge that our students need.	0
ClaimBuster	2138	China has an interest that's very much like ours in one respect, and that is they want a stable world.	1
ClaimBuster	2139	Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank.	1
ClaimBuster	2140	That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	2141	I've a plan in my budget to recruit 100,000 new, highly qualified teachers and to help local school districts build new schools.	1
ClaimBuster	2142	I believe you can protect the environment and grow the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	2143	It was a new negotiation because, as I say, President Ford was within about 10% of having a solution that could be acceptable.	0
ClaimBuster	2144	And you're wondering, how's it going to affect me?	0
ClaimBuster	2145	(Laughter) You don't want us to mention appointees, but when you see the quality of people in our administration, see how Colin Powell performed -- I say administration --	0
ClaimBuster	2146	It has grown in the past seven years.	1
ClaimBuster	2147	Now we will probably need to increase that to same extent.	0
ClaimBuster	2148	"I know that the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody, and a lot of people might be interested in Senator Obama's definition of ""rich."""	0
ClaimBuster	2149	And the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we're going to be in a position to show that costs are going down.	0
ClaimBuster	2150	I was honored to be there.	0
ClaimBuster	2151	There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say it's completely wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	2152	We used to have 18.	1
ClaimBuster	2153	I think we've dramatically changed the world.	0
ClaimBuster	2154	The formal doctrine is very arcane, but I'm going to ask you to deal with it anyway.	0
ClaimBuster	2155	The farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	2156	You've got to reform Congress, they've got to be servants of the people again; you've got to reform the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	2157	And, you know, I've got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	2158	Credit card debt has never been higher.	1
ClaimBuster	2159	Not just to you, but to the entire nation.	0
ClaimBuster	2160	The fact remains almost 30% of his proposed tax cut goes to -- only to Americans that make more than $1 million per year.	1
ClaimBuster	2161	If you'd just tell us what you're going to do, then the American people could compare my plan for the future with your plan.	0
ClaimBuster	2162	Do we spend money on that weapon system in the billions and trillions, or is providing some decent and affordable housing for families of this country something that is at least as important and probably more so.	0
ClaimBuster	2163	Because it's the cornerstone of reform in the State of Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	2164	Soldiers must understand why we're going.	0
ClaimBuster	2165	But I have a plan to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	2166	And that's -- that's -- that's an unfortunate part.	0
ClaimBuster	2167	And therefore, the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care.	1
ClaimBuster	2168	Many inner-city kids just move through.	1
ClaimBuster	2169	Well, we do come from different places.	1
ClaimBuster	2170	And I don't think this Administration has shown the foresight, has shown the knowledge, has been identified with the great fight which these people are waging to be free, to get a better standard of living, to live better.	0
ClaimBuster	2171	Who would have 1200 airplanes worth 2 billion a year just to fly around in?	0
ClaimBuster	2172	Why shouldn't low income Americans and low middle income Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	2173	Here we have a situation which causes all of us concern - causes us concern because of the denial of the rights of people to the equality which we think belongs to everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	2174	And that has been a culture in Washington that has been taking place for too long.	0
ClaimBuster	2175	And as we move during the next four years, those will be the policies of this administration.	0
ClaimBuster	2176	The Constitution of the United States says we're all -- you know, it doesn't say that.	0
ClaimBuster	2177	If you don't have health insurance or you want to buy into a group plan, you will be able to buy into the plan that I just described.	0
ClaimBuster	2178	What I have proposed for a long time, and I've had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies, let's be clear and let's have some straight talk.	0
ClaimBuster	2179	We gave Ambassador Glaspie written instructions.	1
ClaimBuster	2180	Forty years ago, when I was 8 years old, he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group.	1
ClaimBuster	2181	We imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same date just a year ago.	1
ClaimBuster	2182	Middle-income people are going to get a tax break.	1
ClaimBuster	2183	Many say four and a half per cent.	0
ClaimBuster	2184	They're almost at the bottom on every single category.	1
ClaimBuster	2185	And as for why it happened, I'm no expert on the Texas procedures, but what my friends there tell me is that the governor opposed a measure put forward by Democrats in the legislature to expand the number of children that would be covered.	1
ClaimBuster	2186	And I think a critical component of success in Iraq is being able to convince the Iraqis and the Arab world that the United States doesn't have long-term designs on it.	0
ClaimBuster	2187	Some presidents have been strong in foreign policy; others have relied heavily on the secretary of state.	0
ClaimBuster	2188	I think it's important for NATO to be strong and confident.	0
ClaimBuster	2189	But they were not in accordance with international law.	1
ClaimBuster	2190	I am a free trader.	1
ClaimBuster	2191	I was in coal country.	1
ClaimBuster	2192	We have to have control over inflation, and we also have to have a favorable balance of trade.	0
ClaimBuster	2193	That's how you determine if children are progressing to excellence.	0
ClaimBuster	2194	We do more good things for more people in our communities, our neighborhoods, than anywhere that I know of.	0
ClaimBuster	2195	I said in 1992 he didn't extend that courtesy to President Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	2196	We have -- we have a president talking about someone's plan in a way that's completely foreign to what my real plan is.	0
ClaimBuster	2197	And they don't want them.	0
ClaimBuster	2198	Without any doubt, I have stood up and told the American people that that $263 billion deficit must come down.	1
ClaimBuster	2199	North Korea, first, I do.	0
ClaimBuster	2200	I'm watching Hillary go over facts.	0
ClaimBuster	2201	Mr. President, I'd like to head for the fence and try to catch that one before it goes over, but I'll go on to another question.	0
ClaimBuster	2202	But that doesn't mean that we don't have a long way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	2203	The national intelligence assessment that was given to the president in July said, best-case scenario, more of the same of what we see today; worst-case scenario, civil war.	1
ClaimBuster	2204	A mayor of a city like New York, for instance, needs to know uh - eighteen months or two years ahead of time what responsibility the city will have in administration and in financing - in things like housing, uh - pollution control, uh - crime control, education, welfare and health.	0
ClaimBuster	2205	He raises his right hand and takes an oath of office to take care to faithfully execute the laws of the land.	0
ClaimBuster	2206	But ultimately, we've got to pay for the core investments that make this economy strong and somebody's got to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	2207	But I think that we -- I think we have to start with better parenting.	0
ClaimBuster	2208	He still believes it's a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	2209	And if Obamacare is passed, or implemented -- it's already been passed -- if it's implemented fully, it'll be another $2,500 on top.	1
ClaimBuster	2210	Now, under my proposal, for every dollar that I propose in spending for things like education and health care, I will put another dollar into middle class tax cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	2211	This president didn't stand up for Boeing when Airbus was violating international rules and subsidies.	1
ClaimBuster	2212	And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.	0
ClaimBuster	2213	We've got a bumper crop this year.	1
ClaimBuster	2214	At the same time, if we can have a 4-percent recovery continue through that same period of time, that will mean -- without an increase in tax rates -- that will mean $400 billion more in government revenues.	1
ClaimBuster	2215	We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.	1
ClaimBuster	2216	Obviously it has a lot to do with interest rates --	0
ClaimBuster	2217	That's exactly where we find ourselves today.	0
ClaimBuster	2218	You will decide whether we're going to keep fighting crime with a Brady Bill, assault weapons and finish putting those 100,000 police.	0
ClaimBuster	2219	You talk about the surge.	0
ClaimBuster	2220	We've had the Central Accounting.	1
ClaimBuster	2221	We can work on nuclear power plants.	0
ClaimBuster	2222	That leaves all of you who live in the other 50 states without an education reform policy from Senator McCain.	1
ClaimBuster	2223	He has taken the position, when he first indicated in October of last year, that he would even favor compulsory arbitration as one of the weapons the president might have to stop a national emergency strike.	1
ClaimBuster	2224	That boo was excessively loud.	0
ClaimBuster	2225	And the last point I'll make, because we started on energy.	0
ClaimBuster	2226	And you know it, and they know it, and everybody knows it.	0
ClaimBuster	2227	And I mentioned one, and that's the Balkans.	0
ClaimBuster	2228	And I think it's this pattern that troubles me, more than the draft.	0
ClaimBuster	2229	Well, maybe someday, somebody can dream of that.	0
ClaimBuster	2230	Imagine if we had pulled out at that point.	0
ClaimBuster	2231	This is about bringing good jobs back for the middle class of America, and that's what I'm going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	2232	We've always had at least 7 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	2233	My call to our fellow Americans is if you're healthy, if you're younger, don't get a flu shot this year.	0
ClaimBuster	2234	Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan.	0
ClaimBuster	2235	And we did drive them to the negotiating table.	0
ClaimBuster	2236	I think it's much less than it was the day after 9/11.	0
ClaimBuster	2237	There was a lot at stake there, my friends.	0
ClaimBuster	2238	I would take the use of force very seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	2239	We have reduced the number of troops that are deployed and going to be deployed.	1
ClaimBuster	2240	Those are the questions to which the president must establish a moral tone and moral leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	2241	You know who voted for it?	0
ClaimBuster	2242	I hope I'm that person.	0
ClaimBuster	2243	And that's what America is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	2244	Anyway, let me quote the Lewin report.	0
ClaimBuster	2245	You, it's amazing to me, you are all for having more responsibility at the local level for everything except schools.	0
ClaimBuster	2246	So the price of oil has been way down.	1
ClaimBuster	2247	It may be necessary for us to begin testing again.	0
ClaimBuster	2248	If we invest in a serious energy policy, that will save in the amount of money we're borrowing from China to send to Saudi Arabia.	0
ClaimBuster	2249	Under no circumstances would I do anything other than to help this industry get on its feet.	0
ClaimBuster	2250	That's how strongly I feel about it.	0
ClaimBuster	2251	He knew these flights were going on long before and that wasn't the reason that he broke up the conference.	1
ClaimBuster	2252	I propose $2 billion worth.	0
ClaimBuster	2253	But in the last uh - twenty-four months we've turned the economy around and we've brought inflation down to under 6 percent, and we have reduced the uh - well, we have added employment of about four million in the last seventeen months to the point where we have eighty-eight million people working in America today - the most in the history of the country.	1
ClaimBuster	2254	I applaud the no-fly zone, and I know that he's going back to the United Nations to try to get authority to enforce it.	0
ClaimBuster	2255	Governor Romney doesn't have a five-point plan.	0
ClaimBuster	2256	You'll get an access to life-long learning and education, help with tuition if you want to get a new skill or training.	1
ClaimBuster	2257	A promise made will be a promise kept.	0
ClaimBuster	2258	I think the American people tonight have much to be grateful for -- an economic recovery that has become expansion, freedom and, most of all, we are at peace.	1
ClaimBuster	2259	And during that time, he voted 23 times against alternative fuels, 23 times.	1
ClaimBuster	2260	And that is, in fact, I was wrong when I said the president isn't proposing any changes for current retirees.	1
ClaimBuster	2261	I believe part of a hopeful society is one in which somebody owns something.	0
ClaimBuster	2262	That is a basic decision that has to be made so frequently, by every President who serves.	0
ClaimBuster	2263	We're talk about those two paths.	0
ClaimBuster	2264	Meg Whitman was CEO of a company that started with 12 people and is now 1.3 million people in America make their living off eBay.	1
ClaimBuster	2265	They're smart enough to know that's not a good trade.	0
ClaimBuster	2266	Well, I think the president of the United States last winter indicated that before he'd go to the summit in May he did last fall, he indicated that there should be some agenda, that there should be some prior agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	2267	It's a school of strong discipline and high standards.	0
ClaimBuster	2268	And so I believe that we've got to get the power in the hands of the teachers, not the teachers' union.	0
ClaimBuster	2269	And we'll continue to spend money on research and development, because I truly believe that's the way to get from how we live today to being able to live a standard of living that we're accustomed to and being able to protect our environment better, the use of technologies.	0
ClaimBuster	2270	When the president ran for office, he said if you build a coal plant, you can go ahead, but you'll go bankrupt.	1
ClaimBuster	2271	First of all, let's talk about this troop funding issue because John always brings this up.	1
ClaimBuster	2272	This kind of deterioration in our economic strength is bound to weaken us around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	2273	But not until they have given us the full accounting of our MIAs.	0
ClaimBuster	2274	That's not the way we should judge these nominees.	0
ClaimBuster	2275	I believe I'm going to win, because the American people know I know how to lead.	0
ClaimBuster	2276	I have met met uh - decisions over eight hundred times on matters which affect not only the domestic security of the United States, but as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.	1
ClaimBuster	2277	And I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake.	0
ClaimBuster	2278	My friend, Phyllis Hunter, is here.	1
ClaimBuster	2279	And I think the hug Tom Daschle gave him at that moment was about as genuine a sense of there being no Democrats, no Republicans, we were all just Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	2280	We've got some long-term challenges in this economy that have to be dealt with.	0
ClaimBuster	2281	We're going to have to have employers in the new economy, in the economy I'm going to bring to play, that are going to be so anxious to get good workers they're going to be anxious to hire women.	0
ClaimBuster	2282	Senator Kennedy has put a great deal of stress on the necessity for economic assistance.	0
ClaimBuster	2283	But there's a record, and that's what I hope people look at.	1
ClaimBuster	2284	We passed it out of the House of Representatives.	1
ClaimBuster	2285	I'll go one step further.	0
ClaimBuster	2286	They would know how we solved them, and whether our solution was beneficial to them down through the years or whether it hurt them.	0
ClaimBuster	2287	One final point: President Reagan, as Governor of California, signed a bill which is perhaps the most liberal proabortion bill of any State in the Union.	1
ClaimBuster	2288	And I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it.	0
ClaimBuster	2289	In the next four years, I want to focus on the following things.	0
ClaimBuster	2290	Do I have 1 minute?	0
ClaimBuster	2291	But let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods.	0
ClaimBuster	2292	And because we're going to move in sixty-one and two, partly because we have not maintained our strength with sufficient vigor in the last years, I believe that before we meet that crisis, that the next president of the United States should send a message to Congress asking for a revitalization of our military strength, because come spring or late in the winter we're going to be face to face with the most serious Berlin crisis since l949 or fifty.	0
ClaimBuster	2293	You're going to see a lot of people fall over it, because any time you're spending $199 billion dollars a year, somebody's getting it.	1
ClaimBuster	2294	And they've poisoned the mind of the voters.	0
ClaimBuster	2295	In fact, he said he wants to announce that he's going to attack Pakistan.	1
ClaimBuster	2296	And the last thing I'd like to say is this: This grain deal with the Soviet Union in '72 was terrible, and Mr. Ford made up for it with three embargoes, one against our own ally in Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	2297	I think it's accurate to say that Mr. Ford voted against the uh - Voting Rights Acts and the uh - Civil Rights Acts in their uh - debative stage I think once it was assured they were going to pass he finally voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	2298	That we're a nation under God.	0
ClaimBuster	2299	It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information -- in administrations...	1
ClaimBuster	2300	I saved the taxpayer $6.8 billion by fighting a deal for a couple of years, as you might recall, that was a sweetheart deal between an aircraft manufacturer, DOD, and people ended up in jail.	1
ClaimBuster	2301	How about Dr. Lou Sullivan?	0
ClaimBuster	2302	And we said, hey, we've got to unleash the Bush kids.	0
ClaimBuster	2303	All of them with little or no health insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	2304	With regard to the great progress that has been made with this Government spending, the rate of black unemployment in Detroit, Michigan, is 56%.	1
ClaimBuster	2305	I feel that the taxpayers are the ones that need the relief: I don't think we should add additional programs of the magnitude that Governor Carter talks about.	0
ClaimBuster	2306	And I understand they do include investments outside the United States, including in -- in Chinese companies.	1
ClaimBuster	2307	But nevertheless, I support my nominee for Vice President and he'll do an outstanding job.	0
ClaimBuster	2308	But actually limited government can work in the second largest state in the union.	0
ClaimBuster	2309	Sure, but the problem is, you get so many things included in a great big bill that you have to look at the overall good.	0
ClaimBuster	2310	I said we had too many slums.	0
ClaimBuster	2311	The right course for America is to have a true all-of-the-above policy.	0
ClaimBuster	2312	Ninety percent of the casualties are American.	1
ClaimBuster	2313	If we could stop, right now, the testing and the deployment of these space weapons -- and the President's proposals go clear beyond research; if it was just research we wouldn't have any argument, because maybe someday, somebody will think of something -- but to commit this nation to a buildup of antisatellite and space weapons at this time, in their crude state, would bring about an arms race that's very dangerous indeed.	0
ClaimBuster	2314	So I've got a history of reaching across the aisle.	1
ClaimBuster	2315	Under this administration that strength has not been realized.	0
ClaimBuster	2316	If you were going to pass something in the Congress, you had to show where you are going to pay for it and how.	0
ClaimBuster	2317	I owe everything to you, the people of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	2318	It's the only way that we're going to move ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	2319	We'd have that trouble all over America.	0
ClaimBuster	2320	But I want to answer as specifically as I can the question that you have just put to me.	0
ClaimBuster	2321	But the energy - uh policy of our nation is one that uh has not yet been established under this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	2322	Do you realize today in America, we spend $73 billion to help 10 million low- and middle-income families better afford college?	1
ClaimBuster	2323	We didn't put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they're going to receive.	1
ClaimBuster	2324	We have protected 25 million people through the passage of the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that says you can use your health insurance if you change jobs or someone in your family has been sick.	1
ClaimBuster	2325	I don't think my opponent has got the right view about the world to make us safe; I really don't.	0
ClaimBuster	2326	Secondly, the economic growth of the Soviet Union is greater than ours.	1
ClaimBuster	2327	If you want somebody who believes that we were better off eight years ago than we are now and that we ought to go back to the kind of policies that we had back then, emphasizing tax cuts mainly for the wealthy, here is your man.	0
ClaimBuster	2328	"But again, I want to come back to, notice every time Senator Obama says, ""We need to spend more, we need to spend more, that's the answer"" -- why do we always have to spend more?"	0
ClaimBuster	2329	"And then she said, ""But, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything -- promise me one thing, that you'll do everything in your power to make sure that my son's death was not in vain."""	1
ClaimBuster	2330	That's unacceptable for us, and it's essential for a president to show strength from the very beginning, to make it very clear what is acceptable and not acceptable.	0
ClaimBuster	2331	So -- and you launched your political campaign in Mr. Ayers' living room.	1
ClaimBuster	2332	Then he goes on to say that he's going to change the interest-rate situation and we're going to get some more money that way.	0
ClaimBuster	2333	As a matter of fact, today the shortages of non-commissioned officers that John mentioned are such that if we tried to have a draft today, we wouldn't have the non-commissioned officers to train the draftees.	1
ClaimBuster	2334	Secondly, that I think it's important to reach out to moderate Arab nations, like Jordan and Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.	0
ClaimBuster	2335	Those are decisions that the chief executive has to make.	0
ClaimBuster	2336	And I'd like each person to say did I jump to conclusions running down rumors that were so outrageous and so brutal.	0
ClaimBuster	2337	And I will tell you that I'm going to make our country safe.	0
ClaimBuster	2338	And it's because of my belief that if America is going to have the growth that he talks about and that I talk about and that we want, the thing to do is not to discourage individual enterprise, not to discourage people to go out and discover more oil and minerals, but to encourage them.	0
ClaimBuster	2339	And so, the plan that I have proposed - and contrary to what John says, my plan is for a phased-in tax cut over a three-year period, tax increase and depreciation allowances for business and industry to give them the capital to refurbish plant and equipment, research and development, improved technology - all of which we see our foreign competitors having, and we have the greatest percentage of outmoded industrial plant and equipment of any of the industrial nations - produce more, have stable money supply, and give the people of this country a greater share of their own savings.	0
ClaimBuster	2340	I will not do anything to affect the rights of hunters or sportsmen.	0
ClaimBuster	2341	I don't have any speechwriters.	1
ClaimBuster	2342	If you make more than $25,000 a year you don't get a penny of help under the Bush prescription drug proposal for at least four to five years, and then you're pushed into a Medicare -- into an HMO or insurance company plan, and there's no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the conditions.	1
ClaimBuster	2343	He also wants to continue the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	2344	I know they're all for education in science and training, which I strongly support.	0
ClaimBuster	2345	That is the growth that we are looking for; it is the growth that this Administration has supported and that its policies have stimulated.	0
ClaimBuster	2346	It is our greatest ally in the region.	1
ClaimBuster	2347	When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high.	1
ClaimBuster	2348	I don't think we can turn over these kinds of decisions of the collective defense to the United Nations or anything else.	0
ClaimBuster	2349	But it is things that people say.	0
ClaimBuster	2350	We have to be bold.	0
ClaimBuster	2351	But I wanted the American people to know I was willing to give up something.	0
ClaimBuster	2352	But this issue of certainty.	0
ClaimBuster	2353	Mr. Nixon suggests uh - that the United States should go to war if these two islands are attacked.	1
ClaimBuster	2354	We didn't have a lot of chance to talk about this in the last debate.	1
ClaimBuster	2355	Many people are predicting a recession.	0
ClaimBuster	2356	We can work with them on security matters, for example, but it's their call to make.	0
ClaimBuster	2357	And we are now in a position where we have met many of the objectives that got us there in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	2358	The United States of America took the initiative in southern Africa.	0
ClaimBuster	2359	Which our country should do, too.	0
ClaimBuster	2360	Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don't get.	1
ClaimBuster	2361	The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control.	0
ClaimBuster	2362	My opponent thinks the government -- the surplus is the government's money.	0
ClaimBuster	2363	Isn't it time to do it?	0
ClaimBuster	2364	So we're distributing in our State of Texas for free.	1
ClaimBuster	2365	But I'll tell you this.	0
ClaimBuster	2366	Well, in the uh - last two years, as I indicated before, we had a very tough time.	1
ClaimBuster	2367	We have got to have the courage to change.	0
ClaimBuster	2368	Not labels that we attach to each other, questions about each other's patriotism and loyalty.	0
ClaimBuster	2369	And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.	0
ClaimBuster	2370	Not because I am preaching to the people of the South because this isn't just a Southern problem; it's a Northern problem and a Western problem; it's a problem for all of us.	0
ClaimBuster	2371	We ought to help move a million people from welfare to work and we ought to create the finest education system in the world where every 18-year-old can go on to college and all of our younger children have great educational opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	2372	But we've got to get costs down.	0
ClaimBuster	2373	I think medical care should go with the person.	0
ClaimBuster	2374	But it was done three years ago and they're still putting pressure on us from the Arab countries to our discredit around the world.	1
ClaimBuster	2375	You don't negotiate with Mr. Brezhnev from weakness.	0
ClaimBuster	2376	And finally, we were a party to the convention -- to working with Germany, France and Great Britain to send their foreign ministers into Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	2377	It doesn't uh - make a determination as to how uh - that relationship should be achieved in relationship to our current uhh - diplomatic recognition and obligations to the Taiwanese Government.	0
ClaimBuster	2378	But this is another example where I think it is important to look at the record.	0
ClaimBuster	2379	Jim, we've got the capability of doing both.	0
ClaimBuster	2380	We'll take the proper action at the proper time.	0
ClaimBuster	2381	It's bigger than our respective parties.	0
ClaimBuster	2382	We're on the side of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	2383	Look, she's been proven to be a liar on so many different ways.	1
ClaimBuster	2384	And as a consequence, veterans' unemployment is actually now lower than general population.	1
ClaimBuster	2385	In the Oval Office, there's a painting by a friend of Laura and mine named -- by Tom Lee.	1
ClaimBuster	2386	And so I don't know the man well, but I've been disappointed about how he and his administration have conducted the fundraising affairs.	0
ClaimBuster	2387	But in -- oh, but I do.	0
ClaimBuster	2388	And I can tell you right now that Senator Obama would have brought our troops home in defeat.	0
ClaimBuster	2389	First, I think Mary Fisher was a great choice.	0
ClaimBuster	2390	So I'll look at every place where we're investing money.	0
ClaimBuster	2391	Mr. President, you measure it by whether you're getting the job done.	0
ClaimBuster	2392	... you may not be able to have insurance because you can't afford it.	0
ClaimBuster	2393	But we have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out.	0
ClaimBuster	2394	You've seen co-pays go up, deductibles go up.	1
ClaimBuster	2395	I'll tell you what I think has been the most outrageous thing in political dialog, both in this campaign and the one in '82.	0
ClaimBuster	2396	We have to provide leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	2397	In fact, I used to go home, my mother would tell me, Bob, all I've got is my Social Security and my Medicare, don't cut it.	1
ClaimBuster	2398	And we hope that their leadership takes the right decision, but the deal we'll accept is they end their nuclear program.	0
ClaimBuster	2399	I mean, I think in general, let's talk about these issues.	0
ClaimBuster	2400	Obviously some people are going to need help.	0
ClaimBuster	2401	And it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	2402	But most importantly, we're going to have to help ordinary families be able to stay in their homes, make sure that they can pay their bills, deal with critical issues like health care and energy, and we're going to have to change the culture in Washington so that lobbyists and special interests aren't driving the process and your voices aren't being drowned out.	0
ClaimBuster	2403	The President's record is quite different.	0
ClaimBuster	2404	He also promised America that he would go to war as a last resort.	1
ClaimBuster	2405	First of all, 30,000 people being killed by their government is a humanitarian disaster.	1
ClaimBuster	2406	All groups of people are growing.	1
ClaimBuster	2407	This seems to be a trend.	0
ClaimBuster	2408	I certainly didn't feel I should commit American troops to throw him out of where he had gone, and that was the only way to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	2409	And, yet, after sitting through meeting after meeting, he endorsed that decision, endorsed the sale of arms to the Ayatollah in exchange for hostages, one of the most tragic, one of the most mistaken foreign policy decisions we've ever made in this country and I dare say encouraged others to take hostages as we now know.	1
ClaimBuster	2410	Typical cost to you and me is $125,000.	1
ClaimBuster	2411	And they're starting to finally make progress.	0
ClaimBuster	2412	OK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied.	0
ClaimBuster	2413	And I'm paying for all that for those guys.	1
ClaimBuster	2414	With respect to partial-birth abortion, I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there's an exception for the mother's health and life, and this did not contain that exception.	1
ClaimBuster	2415	And we're going to build the strongest international network to prevent nuclear proliferation.	0
ClaimBuster	2416	He was borrowing $14 million from his father to start his businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	2417	You know who voted against it?	0
ClaimBuster	2418	I'd have made a better choice.	0
ClaimBuster	2419	And now the tax code is more fair.	0
ClaimBuster	2420	So that's not where we ought to go.	0
ClaimBuster	2421	Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy.	1
ClaimBuster	2422	And I ask for your support for 4 more years to finish this job.	0
ClaimBuster	2423	And we're making some progress, doing a little better on interdiction.	1
ClaimBuster	2424	I'm going to give you a tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	2425	And I can tell you right now the security of your young men and women who are serving in the military are my first priority right after our nation's security.	0
ClaimBuster	2426	Well, Chris, I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the Social Security Trust Fund.	1
ClaimBuster	2427	My biggest disappointment in Washington is how partisan the town is.	0
ClaimBuster	2428	But look, this has been going on for a year.	1
ClaimBuster	2429	We've got to take this in a new direction, that's what I propose as president.	0
ClaimBuster	2430	Governor Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that Al Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not Al Qaida; you said Russia, in the 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years.	1
ClaimBuster	2431	It's going to require somebody who can work across the partisan divide.	0
ClaimBuster	2432	That's the country that I'm going to fight for.	0
ClaimBuster	2433	I'm deeply concerned that judges are making those decisions and not the citizenry of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	2434	But why shouldn't everybody have that choice.	0
ClaimBuster	2435	I told you never would I do such a thing.	0
ClaimBuster	2436	When President Bush decided we're not going to talk to Iran, we're not going to talk to North Korea, you know what happened?	0
ClaimBuster	2437	And we are helping democracy, Ross.	0
ClaimBuster	2438	If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good.	0
ClaimBuster	2439	His experience has been different from mine.	0
ClaimBuster	2440	They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is.	0
ClaimBuster	2441	And -- and I know that we can reprocess the spent nuclear fuel.	0
ClaimBuster	2442	I hear there's rumors on the Internets (sic) that we're going to have a draft.	0
ClaimBuster	2443	I look around the world, I don't see our influence growing around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	2444	And as soon as we have an investigation and find out where any blame lies for the few that did not get excised or changed, we certainly are going to do something about that.	0
ClaimBuster	2445	... because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do, except even more so.	1
ClaimBuster	2446	It will be a growing and a closer relationship.	0
ClaimBuster	2447	And that's the kind of tough trade actions that are required.	0
ClaimBuster	2448	The government pays for Medicare and Medicaid, as you know, and that's very important.	1
ClaimBuster	2449	There are more people in poverty, one out of six people in poverty.	1
ClaimBuster	2450	I think we need to invest and save more.	0
ClaimBuster	2451	Take for example the marriage penalty.	0
ClaimBuster	2452	Well, we're on the right track.	0
ClaimBuster	2453	So our proposals are very sound and very carefully considered to stimulate jobs, to improve the industrial complex of this country, to create tools for American workers, and at the same time would be anti-inflationary in nature.	0
ClaimBuster	2454	And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions.	1
ClaimBuster	2455	Now, I can't say when this can come.	0
ClaimBuster	2456	It is going to take us to much better advantage in conventional forces.	0
ClaimBuster	2457	I don't think they're right to try to take the tax exemption away from the Catholic Church.	0
ClaimBuster	2458	I appointed a four-star general who led our efforts south of the border to keep drugs from coming into the country as our nation's drug czar.	1
ClaimBuster	2459	The great threat to our country is that these haters end up with weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	2460	And it works- -it works in Milwaukee.	1
ClaimBuster	2461	I took the pledge we'd cut it out.	0
ClaimBuster	2462	I don't agree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	2463	We have an opportunity to have real leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	2464	We also ought to convert more vehicles to compressed natural gas.	0
ClaimBuster	2465	But I don't think it's fair.	0
ClaimBuster	2466	When a factory closes, I know the people who ran it.	1
ClaimBuster	2467	I love the strong women around me.	0
ClaimBuster	2468	"I sit on the Veterans Affairs Committee, and we've got -- I meet veterans all across the country who are trying to figure out, ""How can I get disability payments?"	1
ClaimBuster	2469	That's why I am advocating, and will develop during the course of the next Administration - if, of course, I get the opportunity - a program in which we enlist more aid from these other countries on a concerted basis in the programs of economic development for Africa, Asia and Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	2470	This has not been done, unfortunately.	0
ClaimBuster	2471	Three, we have to consolidate the federal programs to free districts to free the schools and encourage innovators like Michael.	0
ClaimBuster	2472	My opponent had trouble, criticized us, on our policy in Angola.	1
ClaimBuster	2473	20 or 25 birds were killed and brought out a migratory bird act to go after them on a criminal basis.	1
ClaimBuster	2474	Proud that they voted hopefully for me.	0
ClaimBuster	2475	We expect to have a lower deficit in fiscal year 1978.	0
ClaimBuster	2476	I think Mr. Nixon is an effective leader of his party.	0
ClaimBuster	2477	When you have a report, as we did recently, that six out of 10 CONUS Divisions in this country - Continental United States Army Divisions - simply could not pass a readiness test: that two out of three divisions that were to be allocated to the so-called Rapid Deployment Force could not meet a readiness test.	1
ClaimBuster	2478	I object to that part of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill which I think is very unfair and would prove to be so.	0
ClaimBuster	2479	Let me give you an example.	0
ClaimBuster	2480	So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women.	0
ClaimBuster	2481	Just because the president says it can't be done, that you'd lose China, doesn't mean it can't be done.	1
ClaimBuster	2482	Mr. Ford has said, I believe, that it was accurate, and that the White House made no attempt to block the issuing of that report.	1
ClaimBuster	2483	Uh - Mr. Brezhnev and I met in Vladivostok in December of 1974 for the purpose of trying to take the initial step so we could have a SALT II agreement that would go to l985.	1
ClaimBuster	2484	People who are working hard every day, paying payroll tax, gas taxes, but don't make enough income.	0
ClaimBuster	2485	What do we have to do?	0
ClaimBuster	2486	The government has a role.	0
ClaimBuster	2487	I think credibility is going to be very important in the future in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	2488	But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters.	0
ClaimBuster	2489	No, the way to win this is to be steadfast and resolved and to follow through on the plan that I've just outlined.	0
ClaimBuster	2490	We passed family and medical leave.	1
ClaimBuster	2491	We've got to try to have talks, understanding that we're not taking military options off the table.	0
ClaimBuster	2492	And I support the air launch cruise missile, the ground launch cruise missile, the Pershing missile, the Trident submarine, the D - 5 submarine, Stealth technology, the Midgetman -- we have a whole range of technology.	1
ClaimBuster	2493	Doesn't your policy really imply that we're going to have a fairly high rate of unemployment over a fairly long time, that growth is gonna be fairly slow, and that we're not gonna be able to do much - very much in the next four or five years to meet the basic agenda of our national needs in the cities, in health, uh in transit and a whole lot of things like that.	0
ClaimBuster	2494	I want to make sure the equipment for our military is the best it can possibly be, of course.	0
ClaimBuster	2495	So we need to preserve the system.	0
ClaimBuster	2496	But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	2497	But this is a global conflict that requires firm resolve.	0
ClaimBuster	2498	If drugs were legal, I don't think he'd be alive today.	0
ClaimBuster	2499	You just can't promise something like that just to get elected if you know there's a good chance that circumstances may overtake you.	0
ClaimBuster	2500	My opponent was against that.	1
ClaimBuster	2501	Or did they occur while you were a senior official in the federal government?	0
ClaimBuster	2502	We will succeed and we will bring our troops home with honor and victory and not in defeat.	0
ClaimBuster	2503	And both Governor Romney and I agree actually that we should lower our corporate tax rate.	1
ClaimBuster	2504	But I think strength must also require wisdom and smarts in its exercise.	0
ClaimBuster	2505	This Administration and this country last year had the lowest rate of economic growth - which means jobs - of any major industrialized society in the world in 1959.	1
ClaimBuster	2506	I will make sure that we invest in our country and our families.	0
ClaimBuster	2507	You would even be proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	2508	And -- and the -- and the president's statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	2509	Where we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers -- give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system.	0
ClaimBuster	2510	We need fundamental change in this country, and that's what I'd like to bring.	0
ClaimBuster	2511	I happen to think it's double that.	0
ClaimBuster	2512	If you make more -- if you make less than a quarter million dollars a year, then you will not see your income tax go up, your capital gains tax go up, your payroll tax.	1
ClaimBuster	2513	But now let's talk about the pluses that came out this week.	0
ClaimBuster	2514	And the question, is it worth the cost, reminds me of my own thinking when I came back from fighting in that war.	0
ClaimBuster	2515	But I will tell you, I've been all over.	0
ClaimBuster	2516	This administration seems to run that every morning.	0
ClaimBuster	2517	I think we can save money through this whole very sophisticated concept, Andrea, that I know you do understand of competitive strategies.	0
ClaimBuster	2518	Mr. President, have you looked at your pension?	0
ClaimBuster	2519	That means keep government out of it.	0
ClaimBuster	2520	And the Vice President cast the deciding vote against federal aid for teachers' salaries in the Senate, which prevented that being added.	1
ClaimBuster	2521	That's why we've had 24 retired generals and admirals, hundreds of business people, many of them Republican, support this campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	2522	We've expanded Pell Grants by a million students.	1
ClaimBuster	2523	I'm the president that stood up and said, don't mess with Social Security, and I'm not going to and we haven't and we are not going to go after the Social Security recipient.	1
ClaimBuster	2524	And if we have to get tough with Iran, believe me, we will get tough.	0
ClaimBuster	2525	would agree with us as well.	0
ClaimBuster	2526	You might say that took a lot of hard work.	0
ClaimBuster	2527	And they're very fine and very highly qualified.	0
ClaimBuster	2528	I was born in Detroit.	1
ClaimBuster	2529	But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it.	0
ClaimBuster	2530	That's not just going after places where there's abuse.	0
ClaimBuster	2531	Now, there are some other issues that have a bearing on how women succeed in the workplace.	0
ClaimBuster	2532	A lot of uh - very high quality, low-carbon coal, uh - low-sulfur coal is there, it's where our employment is needed.	1
ClaimBuster	2533	And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters.	1
ClaimBuster	2534	And I saw a problem in the public education system in America.	0
ClaimBuster	2535	I think they understand my commitment to helping them in the neighborhoods.	0
ClaimBuster	2536	As I understand it, we're building some 14 military bases there now, and some people say they've got a rather permanent concept to them.	1
ClaimBuster	2537	My dad was head of a car company.	1
ClaimBuster	2538	You can invest in a company, bankrupt it, lay off the workers, strip away their pensions, and you still make money.	0
ClaimBuster	2539	And that's the reason why I set up a trade task force to go after cheaters when it came to international trade.	1
ClaimBuster	2540	And I think that would be a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	2541	And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it.	0
ClaimBuster	2542	Now, we can do better.	0
ClaimBuster	2543	That's why I tried to be so specific in this campaign to have a mandate, if elected, so that Congress will know what the American people have voted for.	0
ClaimBuster	2544	I have a much better -- she spent -- let me tell you -- she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising -- you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names -- oh, temperament, let's go after -- I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament.	1
ClaimBuster	2545	I think what Mr. Arafat wants us to do is to make sure that everybody honors the agreements they've already made.	0
ClaimBuster	2546	Reduce the capital gains rate.	0
ClaimBuster	2547	And one of those dreams is justice.	0
ClaimBuster	2548	Now we've got all thousands and thousands of refugees.	1
ClaimBuster	2549	I will give middle-class Americans tax cuts, meaningful ones.	0
ClaimBuster	2550	Communism is the enemy of all religions; and we who do believe in God must join together.	0
ClaimBuster	2551	"He said, ""Sarah and I live on the east side of the mountain."	0
ClaimBuster	2552	In 1935, when the Social Security Act was written, ninety-four out of ninety-five Republicans voted against it.	1
ClaimBuster	2553	And to countries like Georgia and the Ukraine, I think we have to insist that they are free to join NATO if they meet the requirements, and they should have a membership action plan immediately to start bringing them in.	1
ClaimBuster	2554	We would have to close twenty military bases in the United States immediately.	1
ClaimBuster	2555	A lot of kids are expressing their concerns.	0
ClaimBuster	2556	But Government has never reduced Government does not tax to get the money it needs.	1
ClaimBuster	2557	I'm going to give the President some credit.	0
ClaimBuster	2558	Yes, I think it is.	0
ClaimBuster	2559	We have deregulated the air industry, the rail industry, the trucking industry, financial institutions.	1
ClaimBuster	2560	We have had some luck with Nigeria, but in Sierra Leon, and now that Nigeria has become a democracy, and we hope it stays that way, then maybe we can build on that.	1
ClaimBuster	2561	ery high, we might channel specific uh targeted job - job - uh opportunities by paying part of the salary of unemployed people - uh and also sharing with uh - local governments the uh - payment of salaries which would uh - let us cut down the unemployment rate much lower, before we hit the inflationary level.	0
ClaimBuster	2562	I'm also a former law enforcement officer.	1
ClaimBuster	2563	But while the President is negotiating with the Soviet Union, I simply do not want to make these unilateral cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	2564	And they are the innocent bystanders here in what is the biggest financial crisis and challenge of our time.	1
ClaimBuster	2565	Well, for 18 months he's been running on this tax plan.	1
ClaimBuster	2566	So I think it would be a good thing for America if it happened.	0
ClaimBuster	2567	But if they ever did overthrow Assad, you might end up with -- as bad as Assad is, and he's a bad guy, but you may very well end up with worse than Assad.	0
ClaimBuster	2568	But let's talk about what the Ford administration has done in the field of environment.	0
ClaimBuster	2569	If I have anything in politics, it's my word.	0
ClaimBuster	2570	I think you've seen tonight in this debate that Governor Reagan and I have agreed on exactly one thing - we are both against the reimposition of a peacetime draft.	1
ClaimBuster	2571	And, unfortunately, when -- when -- when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	2572	I get wound up because I feel strongly --	0
ClaimBuster	2573	You're going to have a lot of new members of Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	2574	And you'd think, well, then why lower the rates?	0
ClaimBuster	2575	And the choices we've made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	2576	For two years, the president didn't even engage with North Korea, did nothing at all, while it was growing more dangerous, despite the warnings of former Secretary of Defense William Perry, who negotiated getting television cameras and inspectors into that reactor.	1
ClaimBuster	2577	But Pakistan is important to the region, to the world and to us, because Pakistan has 100 nuclear warheads and they're rushing to build a lot more.	1
ClaimBuster	2578	That's one thing I learned by forging that tremendous and greatly--highly successful coalition against Saddam Hussein, the dictator.	0
ClaimBuster	2579	You walk down the street, you get shot.	1
ClaimBuster	2580	And the reason he didn't is, he said -- he wrote in his book -- because there was no viable exit strategy.	1
ClaimBuster	2581	So yes, I think it should be expanded.	0
ClaimBuster	2582	And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality.	0
ClaimBuster	2583	That's like the family of medical-leave law; it just tries to set the rules of the game.	0
ClaimBuster	2584	You don't get a hand gun, you don't get a rifle, you don't get a shot gun, you get zippo.	0
ClaimBuster	2585	You see, in order to get something done on behalf of the people, you have to put partisanship aside, and that's what we did in my state.	1
ClaimBuster	2586	And so a Pakistan that falls apart, becomes a failed state, would be of extraordinary danger to Afghanistan and to us.	0
ClaimBuster	2587	I disapprove of the issue.	0
ClaimBuster	2588	Ronald Reagan got together with Tip O'Neill and Howard Baker, two Republicans and one Democrat.	1
ClaimBuster	2589	But as far as strength derived from commitment to principles, as far as strength derived from the unity within our country, as far as strength derived from the people, the Congress, the secretary of state, the president, sharing in the evolution and carrying-out of a foreign policy, as far as strength derived from the respect of our own allies and friends, their assurance that we will be staunch in our commitment, that we will not deviate and that we'll give them adequate attention, as far as - as strength derived from doing what's right - caring for the poor, providing food, becoming the breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world - in those respects, we're not strong.	0
ClaimBuster	2590	I have sustained it since then.	1
ClaimBuster	2591	Talking about this and this.	0
ClaimBuster	2592	You can't have 23 million people struggling to get a job.	0
ClaimBuster	2593	Some of it's said in entertainment.	0
ClaimBuster	2594	And we want a democracy in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	2595	And as we pursue the enemy wherever it exists, we'll also spread freedom and liberty.	0
ClaimBuster	2596	We were closing loopholes, we were going after big corporations.	1
ClaimBuster	2597	Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York.	1
ClaimBuster	2598	I supported giving parents a V-chip on their television so if they don't want their young kids to watch things they shouldn't watch, they wouldn't have to.	1
ClaimBuster	2599	The inclination that Governor Reagan has exemplified in many troubled times since he has been running for President - I think since 1968 - to inject American military forces in places like North Korea, to put a blockade around Cuba this year, or in some instances, to project American forces into a fishing dispute against the small nation of Ecuador on the west coast of South America.	1
ClaimBuster	2600	It had nothing to do with the debate on Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	2601	Think of this as their country.	0
ClaimBuster	2602	He gets the first --	0
ClaimBuster	2603	There's only 25 percent of the people in there.	1
ClaimBuster	2604	What we have to do is simply to make some adjustments to take account of the fact that the baby boomers, people like me, are bigger in number than the people that went just before us and the people that come just after us.	0
ClaimBuster	2605	Everybody cares if people aren't doing well.	0
ClaimBuster	2606	That's what happened in Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	2607	"And consequently, I don't think it's enough to go before Republican audiences - and I never do - and say, ""Look, vote for me because I'm a Republican."""	0
ClaimBuster	2608	101 in leadership is be accountable for what you do.	0
ClaimBuster	2609	The people of Serbia have acted very bravely in kicking this guy out of office.	0
ClaimBuster	2610	We're not doing as well amongst the people that get to be habitual drug-users.	0
ClaimBuster	2611	I support the President's position.	0
ClaimBuster	2612	Because even though we have maintained, as I pointed out in our first debate, the absolute gap over the Soviet Union; even though the growth in this Administration has been twice as much as it was in the Truman Administration; that isn't good enough.	1
ClaimBuster	2613	His some of his college presidents aren't exactly holier than thou.	0
ClaimBuster	2614	Now, if you're a business person, and you can locate any place in the world, then, obviously, if you go to the country where it's 11 percent tax versus 35 percent, you're going to be able to create jobs, increase your business, make more investment, et cetera.	0
ClaimBuster	2615	And I'll do a good job, because I am committed.	0
ClaimBuster	2616	And that's not the facts.	0
ClaimBuster	2617	We could be providing logistical support, setting up a no-fly zone at relatively little cost to us, but we can only do it if we can help mobilize the international community and lead.	0
ClaimBuster	2618	I personally don't think that's the right kind of future for America, and I think we ought to take a different tack.	0
ClaimBuster	2619	We've had a lot of other presidents who didn't wear their country's uniform who had to order our young soldiers into battle, including President Wilson and President Roosevelt.	1
ClaimBuster	2620	She said, reading is the new civil right.	1
ClaimBuster	2621	The main issue is whether or not the Roe v. Wade decision is going to be overturned.	0
ClaimBuster	2622	We have to find ways to reestablish it in foreign policy and national security policy.	0
ClaimBuster	2623	We are serving a million more families now.	1
ClaimBuster	2624	And I'm afraid that's what I think I'm hearing from Governor Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	2625	And as a result, our universities are now more diverse.	1
ClaimBuster	2626	If the laws are violated so much, but to suggest if somebody represents a foreign country on anything, that makes him corrupt or against the taxpayer, I don't agree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	2627	And the president said never, never, never would he raise taxes in New Jersey, and within a day Marlin Fitzwater, his spokesman, said now, that's not a promise.	1
ClaimBuster	2628	We've sort of distanced ourselves from our ally, South Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	2629	It is believed that probably 70% of the potential oil in the United States is probably hidden in those lands, and no one is allowed to even go and explore to find out if it is there.	1
ClaimBuster	2630	How do you do that?	0
ClaimBuster	2631	Under the present administration - Nixon's and Ford's - we've had three times the inflation rate that we experienced under President Johnson and President Kennedy.	1
ClaimBuster	2632	This isn't the beginning of the end of this crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	2633	Let the states and localities do that.	0
ClaimBuster	2634	And when we had Osama bin Laden cornered in the mountains of Tora Bora, 1,000 of his cohorts with him in those mountains.	1
ClaimBuster	2635	It had nothing to do with us.	1
ClaimBuster	2636	Well, as I've indicated, I think that it has a significant role to play.	0
ClaimBuster	2637	Look, this is the year -- this is in the aftermath of Columbine, and Paducah, and all the places in our country where the nation has been shocked by these weapons in the hands of the wrong people.	0
ClaimBuster	2638	And that is to get the support of the people.	0
ClaimBuster	2639	Secondly, I've said that I will not support the cuts in Social Security and Medicare and the rest that the President has proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	2640	It just shows a significant difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	2641	I don't believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding who's going to play tennis on the White House court.	0
ClaimBuster	2642	Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent.	1
ClaimBuster	2643	I was down in Texas taking care of business, tending to my family.	1
ClaimBuster	2644	They were not within the treaty area when the treaty was passed in fifty-five.	1
ClaimBuster	2645	I think the governor may not have heard what I said clearly.	0
ClaimBuster	2646	Now we cannot allow a second Holocaust.	0
ClaimBuster	2647	Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle.	1
ClaimBuster	2648	I don't know -- starting after 4 years.	0
ClaimBuster	2649	I see that as part of my job as president, and I'll make my best effort to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	2650	"The way my opponent talks, he said, ""We're going to spend the government's money."	1
ClaimBuster	2651	And that fact is just not right.	1
ClaimBuster	2652	I promised a new beginning.	0
ClaimBuster	2653	I would pass a hate crimes law, as I said, and I guess I had misunderstood the governor's previous position.	1
ClaimBuster	2654	That's what took us from surplus to deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	2655	Maybe we will have another debate on the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	2656	They're back away from a nuclear proliferation treaty that we had with them.	1
ClaimBuster	2657	When Harry Truman was president he was not afraid to have a strong secretary of defense.	0
ClaimBuster	2658	Most recently out in Aurora.	0
ClaimBuster	2659	And thanks to UNLV for hosting us.	0
ClaimBuster	2660	You've got a back-door draft right now.	0
ClaimBuster	2661	Well, that sounds very good, but it's very wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	2662	I think the basic difference is, and I have had some experience in this, I think the basic difference, I trust the people.	0
ClaimBuster	2663	You're for school uniforms and curfews and you're opposed to truancy.	0
ClaimBuster	2664	And we've got to give some trust and confidence back to America.	0
ClaimBuster	2665	I think you have to have a system of primary and preventive clinics in our inner cities and our rural areas so people can have access to health care.	0
ClaimBuster	2666	We see the Russians coming out of Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	2667	Now, let's look at priorities.	0
ClaimBuster	2668	I go into this race as their servant, and I belong to them.	0
ClaimBuster	2669	I -- I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals.	0
ClaimBuster	2670	It would go into the Social Security Trust Fund.	1
ClaimBuster	2671	She didn't answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens...	1
ClaimBuster	2672	But if you don't have the guts to control costs by changing the insurance system and taking on the bureaucracies and the regulation of health care in the private and public sector, you can't fix this problem.	0
ClaimBuster	2673	I want the line-item veto.	0
ClaimBuster	2674	And I would hope that one of the things I could do as president is to recognize them, to give them the kind of recognition that they need and deserve so that more and more young people can themselves become the heroes of tomorrow, can go into public service, can go into teaching, can go into drug counseling, can go into law enforcement, and be heroes themselves to generations yet to come.	0
ClaimBuster	2675	You could have done it, if you were an effective -- if you were an effective senator, you could have done it.	0
ClaimBuster	2676	We're low spending, low tax burden.	1
ClaimBuster	2677	I think the American people should take into account who we are as individuals, what our experience is, what our positions are on the issues and proposals are.	0
ClaimBuster	2678	We have a fundamental difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	2679	Let me just say to you, number one, don't throw the labels around.	0
ClaimBuster	2680	Let me tell you that I, first of all, oppose an election year tax cut, whether it is the 10% across-the-board tax cut promised to the taxpayers by my opponent in this debate tonight, or whether it is the $27.5 billion tax cut promised on the 20th of August by President Carter.	1
ClaimBuster	2681	There are 7 trillion dollars in assets locked up in America.	1
ClaimBuster	2682	So the question is, would you buy a used election promise from my opponent.	0
ClaimBuster	2683	It's the US that's taken the lead in humanitarian aid into Bosnia.	1
ClaimBuster	2684	We've got a great economic package which I hope we will discuss later.	0
ClaimBuster	2685	One thing I've noted as I've traveled around the country are the tremendous number of children who come out to see the presidential candidates.	1
ClaimBuster	2686	"It was a - a tremendous surge of patriotism, that ""I want to make a sacrifice for my country."""	0
ClaimBuster	2687	We've shipped millions of jobs overseas and we have a strange situation because we have a process in Washington where after you've served for a while you cash in, become a foreign lobbyist, make $30,000 a month, then take a leave, work on presidential campaigns, make sure you've got good contacts and then go back out.	1
ClaimBuster	2688	We have to work much more closely with the Pakistanis.	0
ClaimBuster	2689	So I hope and expect that I will be liked by the people of this country as president of the United States; I certainly hope I will be liked by them on the 8th of November.	0
ClaimBuster	2690	It was lies, and it was fiction.	0
ClaimBuster	2691	Can we start the clock over?	0
ClaimBuster	2692	It's a part of the Social Security system.	1
ClaimBuster	2693	I don't have time to tell you the stories.	0
ClaimBuster	2694	Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	2695	Look what happened to her.	0
ClaimBuster	2696	About a year ago he cut the Pentagon budget six point eight billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	2697	You've got to look at our records.	0
ClaimBuster	2698	And we can do it, too.	0
ClaimBuster	2699	I'm addressing him all evening as Mr. President.	1
ClaimBuster	2700	And there's no market forces involved with health care.	1
ClaimBuster	2701	Well, Mr. Ford is - is uh changing uh considerably his previous philosophy.	1
ClaimBuster	2702	So I consider that a compliment.	0
ClaimBuster	2703	I did think we ought to extend the assault weapons ban, and was told the fact that the bill was never going to move, because Republicans and Democrats were against the assault weapon ban, people of both parties.	1
ClaimBuster	2704	Its not the amount of time you spend in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	2705	And my word is good.	0
ClaimBuster	2706	They're not left or right.	0
ClaimBuster	2707	We have been moving much faster than we did in the Truman years.	0
ClaimBuster	2708	Ã‚ But I do have a lot of experience in getting things done.	0
ClaimBuster	2709	Our people wanna go back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	2710	All of these are programs that Senator Dole opposed that I supported, because I felt they were a legitimate effort to help people make the most of their own lives.	1
ClaimBuster	2711	And John has just made up some very interesting figures.	0
ClaimBuster	2712	My message to the troops is also: Thank you for what they're doing, but it's also help is on the way.	0
ClaimBuster	2713	We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding.	0
ClaimBuster	2714	When I have sent the fleet into the Taiwan straits.	0
ClaimBuster	2715	In businesses that can create the new energy economy of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	2716	We need to get the economy going.	0
ClaimBuster	2717	In the budget that I submitted to the Congress in January this year, I re- recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending.	1
ClaimBuster	2718	It is a serious problem, but I don't see it as the kind of terrible, terrible problem that the S&L problem was.	0
ClaimBuster	2719	After 9/11, we had to look at the world differently.	0
ClaimBuster	2720	Choose your doctor, choose your plan.	0
ClaimBuster	2721	The auto industry has come roaring back.	0
ClaimBuster	2722	When Senator Dole made that remark about all the elitists, all the young elitists in the administration, one of the young men who works for me who grew up in a house trailer looked at me and said, Mr. President, I know how you grew up, who is he talking about.	1
ClaimBuster	2723	We're going to have a strong border.	0
ClaimBuster	2724	And we all have ideas out there, and Mr. Bush has a record.	0
ClaimBuster	2725	I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	2726	Well, I think Senator McCain's absolutely right that we need more responsibility, but we need it not just when there's a crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	2727	It means that there will be increased employment.	0
ClaimBuster	2728	I decided the right action was in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	2729	And the President, Mr. Mondale, has called you whining and vacillating, among the more charitable phrases -- weak, I believe.	1
ClaimBuster	2730	In the first century of our nation's history our forefathers gave us the finest form of government in the history of mankind.	0
ClaimBuster	2731	The answer is very straightforward.	0
ClaimBuster	2732	If I say no, it ignores their behavior.	0
ClaimBuster	2733	More in July than June.	1
ClaimBuster	2734	So let me get this right.	0
ClaimBuster	2735	I am going to protect the American taxpayer against the spend and tax Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	2736	That's the one who is being aborted.	0
ClaimBuster	2737	People -- the 18- to 24-year-old high school graduates 10 years ago were making more than they are now.	1
ClaimBuster	2738	And when it gets overextended, morale drops.	0
ClaimBuster	2739	Not all wisdom is in Washington, D.C. on this issue.	0
ClaimBuster	2740	They seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the Truman Administration which preceded it.	1
ClaimBuster	2741	In other words, the next president, as he leads America and the free world, can be only as great as the American people are great.	0
ClaimBuster	2742	And this area on the border has not been governed since the days of Alexander the Great.	1
ClaimBuster	2743	But we have 2,478 specific recommendations from a commission of more than 2,000 business people in this country, through the Grace commission, that we're studying right now -- and we've already implemented 17 percent of them -- that are recommendations as to how to make government more efficient, more economic.	1
ClaimBuster	2744	Plus, I want them all voting for me.	0
ClaimBuster	2745	and the military that liked it better the way it used to be.	0
ClaimBuster	2746	I can give you hundreds of -- you can probably give me 200 cases where one vote made a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	2747	And if we have an across-the-board spending freeze, we're not going to be able to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	2748	And since that action, terrorist action against the United States citizens have gone down.	1
ClaimBuster	2749	But I also want to say to seniors, if you're happy with Medicare the way it is, fine, you can stay in the program.	0
ClaimBuster	2750	And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I'm so fortunate enough to become your president.	0
ClaimBuster	2751	That's the problem with our system.	0
ClaimBuster	2752	Quotas tend to pit one group of people against another.	0
ClaimBuster	2753	You see, I have a fundamental difference.	0
ClaimBuster	2754	That is the same Government that, in 1920, told us we only had enough oil left for 13 years, and 19 years later, told us we only had enough left for another 15 years.	1
ClaimBuster	2755	An African American was my chief cabinet officer.	1
ClaimBuster	2756	And my point has been, as opposed to politicizing an issue like Medicare, in other words, holding it up as an issue, hoping somebody bites it and try to clobber them over the head with it for political purposes, this year, in the year 2000, it's time to get it done once and for all.	0
ClaimBuster	2757	I know how to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	2758	First of all, I won't repeat the mistake that I regret enormously, and that is, after we were able to help the Afghan freedom fighters and drive the Russians out of Afghanistan, we basically washed our hands of the region.	1
ClaimBuster	2759	But we're going to have to invest in the American people again, in tax cuts for the middle class, in health care for all Americans, and college for every young person who wants to go.	0
ClaimBuster	2760	That wasn't the kind of call to service that I think the American people were looking for.	0
ClaimBuster	2761	It's the very few that create most of the crises, and we just have to find them and deal with them.	0
ClaimBuster	2762	Where I've been critical of the Administration's policy, and where I criticized Mr. Nixon, was because in his press conference in Havana in 1955, he praised the competence and stability of the bicta- bict- Batista dictatorship - that dictatorship had killed over twenty thousand Cubans in seven years.	1
ClaimBuster	2763	But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do.	1
ClaimBuster	2764	They retired General Shinseki for telling him that.	1
ClaimBuster	2765	We may not find that many this evening, so I wanted to emphasize.	0
ClaimBuster	2766	We are not dependent upon the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	2767	The President inherited a good economy, sure the S&L crisis then were selling assets.	1
ClaimBuster	2768	We're going to speed up the process, big league, because it's very inefficient.	0
ClaimBuster	2769	I've gotten to know so many -- I've developed so many friends over the last year.	0
ClaimBuster	2770	I'm interested in 240 million citizens in this country who share in the American dream, all of them in every part of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	2771	You can't stand there, Governor Clinton, and say, well, I think I'd have been -- I have supported the minority, let sanctions work or wish it would go away -- but I would have voted with the majority.	0
ClaimBuster	2772	In regard to the exchange of students and labor unions, I am chairman of the subcommittee on Africa and I think that one of the most unfortunate phases of our policy towards that country was the very minute number of exchanges that we had.	1
ClaimBuster	2773	They want us to talk about the problems of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	2774	I believe I offer tested, strong leadership that can calm the waters of the troubled world.	0
ClaimBuster	2775	... in many cases, ISIS-aligned, and we now have them in our country, and wait until you see -- this is going to be the great Trojan horse.	1
ClaimBuster	2776	She's done a terrible job for the African-Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	2777	The president can modify the uh - economic structure of a country by public statements and general attitudes in the budget that he proposes.	0
ClaimBuster	2778	She doesn't even know who the rebels are.	1
ClaimBuster	2779	They jumped on me yesterday for being a little optimistic about the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	2780	I'm appalled at the highest outrageous numbers of divorces -- it happens in families, it's happened in ours.	0
ClaimBuster	2781	Yes, I understand what it means to the commander in chief.	0
ClaimBuster	2782	The HMOs and the insurance companies support the other bill that's pending, the one that the Republican majority has put forward.	1
ClaimBuster	2783	I would simply say to her, look, take a look at what the president has proposed on job retraining.	0
ClaimBuster	2784	Governor Bush is in favor of vouchers which take taxpayer money away from public schools and give them to private schools that are not accountable for how the money is used and don't have to take all applicants.	1
ClaimBuster	2785	We have seen Afghanistan worsen, deteriorate.	1
ClaimBuster	2786	These kinds of things uh - ought to be done, uh they ought to be encouraged and supported, and even required uh by the government, yes.	0
ClaimBuster	2787	The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks.	0
ClaimBuster	2788	I oppose supply management and production controls.	0
ClaimBuster	2789	And we haven't done a very good job of that at the federal level recently.	0
ClaimBuster	2790	... where they're not paying us what we need.	0
ClaimBuster	2791	Other senators, other congressmen choose other programs.	0
ClaimBuster	2792	They would have won an appeal.	0
ClaimBuster	2793	I propose to spend 1.6 trillion dollars on defense between now and the year 2002 and there's less than 1 percent difference between my budget and the Republican budget on defense.	1
ClaimBuster	2794	Now, should people pay more for Medicare if they can?	0
ClaimBuster	2795	They've got sneak-and-peek searches that are allowed.	1
ClaimBuster	2796	I think we have to be very reticent about that.	0
ClaimBuster	2797	And he opposed even President Carter, when toward the end of his term President Carter wanted to increase the defense budget.	1
ClaimBuster	2798	I'd better correct the President.	0
ClaimBuster	2799	That's part -- that's part one.	0
ClaimBuster	2800	But what I think the American people recognize is after a decade of war it's time to do some nation building here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	2801	That will help reinforce the values that parents teach at home as well.	0
ClaimBuster	2802	Also, I want to thank the people of Cleveland and Ohio for being such hospitable hosts during these last few hours in my life.	0
ClaimBuster	2803	I know what our needs are.	0
ClaimBuster	2804	And all these things have contributed to us lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels in 16 years.	1
ClaimBuster	2805	I don't think that our record of human rights can be assailed.	0
ClaimBuster	2806	We're one of the first states that said you can sue an HMO for denying you proper coverage.	1
ClaimBuster	2807	Secondly, I think the question is uh - what are the programs that we advocate, what is the party record that we lead?	0
ClaimBuster	2808	And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people.	0
ClaimBuster	2809	I - I think it's accurate to say that Mr. Ford's position on gun control has changed.	1
ClaimBuster	2810	The people who have jobs and educations and opportunities that didn't have them 10 years ago don't think it's irrelevant at all; they think it's highly relevant and they wish the rest of the country had them.	0
ClaimBuster	2811	And I would do everything I could in my power to bring that about.	0
ClaimBuster	2812	What that means is that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade.	0
ClaimBuster	2813	And I said, let's fix this system.	0
ClaimBuster	2814	I made a proposal three months ago on this.	1
ClaimBuster	2815	That's another story that we're going to pay a big price for right after the election.	0
ClaimBuster	2816	Now this agenda should delineate those issues on which there is a possibility of some agreement or negotiation.	0
ClaimBuster	2817	We have an arms race underway instead.	0
ClaimBuster	2818	Very serious mistakes in judgment were made.	0
ClaimBuster	2819	It's going to have to be employed in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	2820	And it would be a tax paid by the consumers, and then we're asked to believe that some way, they would get this back to the consumers.	0
ClaimBuster	2821	You know, if they asked me to be part of some monitoring force -- as we are in the Sinai and have been since 1978 -- to monitor the peace between Egypt and Israel, frankly, I would have to think about it.	0
ClaimBuster	2822	I don't mind those enterprise zones; let's try them, but not as a substitute for the others.	0
ClaimBuster	2823	And it fits with his philosophy.	0
ClaimBuster	2824	So what would I have done?	0
ClaimBuster	2825	I trust women to make the decisions that affect their lives, their destinies and their bodies.	1
ClaimBuster	2826	The charter of the United Nations - its Preamble, Article I and Article II - also provide that there shall be no intervention by one nation in the internal affairs of another.	1
ClaimBuster	2827	We don't talk about it.	0
ClaimBuster	2828	Thirty-five to forty countries in the world had a greater capability of making weapons at the moment the president invaded than Saddam Hussein.	1
ClaimBuster	2829	Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation.	0
ClaimBuster	2830	But what I would do is appoint people to the Federal Bench that will not legislate from the Bench, who will interpret the Constitution.	0
ClaimBuster	2831	If you don't have trust in that, I do.	0
ClaimBuster	2832	They're the best -- they're most -- have best -- we're the best exporters.	0
ClaimBuster	2833	The president moved the troops, so he's got 10 times the number of troops in Iraq than he has in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is.	1
ClaimBuster	2834	As a matter of fact, I would like to take the issue a little further.	0
ClaimBuster	2835	I don't think the answer is to slow the economy down more, drive unemployment up more and undermine the health of the private sector.	0
ClaimBuster	2836	Because there's a huge pool, we can drop the costs.	0
ClaimBuster	2837	And for the most part I agree with Senator McCain on many of the steps that have to be taken.	0
ClaimBuster	2838	We have always been willing to go the extra mile to negotiate for disarmament or in any other area.	1
ClaimBuster	2839	Well, I-we obviously have a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	2840	Thank you very much, Jim, and I'll begin by answering your questions -- your last question.	0
ClaimBuster	2841	I mean, you know, it's tough to ask a teacher who's making $30,000 or $35,000 a year to tighten her belt when people who are making much more than her are living pretty high on the hog.	0
ClaimBuster	2842	We've got to do it now.	0
ClaimBuster	2843	Mr. Nixon has been part of that Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	2844	Right now our military is the strongest in the entire history of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	2845	It's a moral responsibility for us and the world.	0
ClaimBuster	2846	We simply cannot pull back.	0
ClaimBuster	2847	And if we are only thinking about tomorrow or the next day and not thinking about 10 years from now, we're not going to control our own economic future.	0
ClaimBuster	2848	Go back to Jimmy Carter, and interest rates were 21%, inflation was 15%.	1
ClaimBuster	2849	It includes telling the oil companies, that currently have 68 million acres that they're not using, that either you use them or you lose them.	1
ClaimBuster	2850	He endorses the Democratic uh - platform which, as I read it, calls for approximately sixty additional programs.	1
ClaimBuster	2851	I'm not exactly sure how you enhance the penalty any more than the death penalty.	0
ClaimBuster	2852	I'm not going to be the kind of president that says you get tax relief and you don't.	0
ClaimBuster	2853	We started from the day we got into office.	1
ClaimBuster	2854	I ask the American people to join me in this partnership.	0
ClaimBuster	2855	We have enormous trade imbalance with China, and it's worse this year than last year, and it's worse last year than the year before.	1
ClaimBuster	2856	And here is the simple difference.	0
ClaimBuster	2857	The first President out of thirty-eight that ever resigned from public office under pressure.	1
ClaimBuster	2858	He has one-third as much chance to get through college as a white student.	1
ClaimBuster	2859	We need to have a very effective leadership effort in Syria, making sure that the -- the insurgent there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed, are people who will be the responsible parties.	0
ClaimBuster	2860	We want freedom to gain.	0
ClaimBuster	2861	We're first in other areas of science but in space, which is the new science, we're not first.	1
ClaimBuster	2862	I've never heard Governor Clinton make a mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	2863	And I think that's the way it ought to be.	0
ClaimBuster	2864	You ought to put it in prudent, safe investments so that $1 trillion over the next ten years grows to be $3 trillion.	0
ClaimBuster	2865	The same old experience is not relevant.	0
ClaimBuster	2866	When the president took office, the price of gasoline here in Nassau County was about $1.86 a gallon.	1
ClaimBuster	2867	I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system.	0
ClaimBuster	2868	Now, I understand what the governor has said about asking the Russians to be involved, and under some circumstances that might be a good idea.	0
ClaimBuster	2869	And this is one of the reasons why one of the first -- the first bill I signed was something called the Lily Ledbetter bill.	1
ClaimBuster	2870	Number two, investigate exactly what happened, regardless of where the facts lead us, to make sure folks are held accountable and it doesn't happen again.	0
ClaimBuster	2871	The same thing will be done uh - at the federal government level.	0
ClaimBuster	2872	But that's not the point here.	0
ClaimBuster	2873	My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald's, assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it.	0
ClaimBuster	2874	On the question of the development of natural resources, I would pay as you go in the sense that they would be balanced and the power revenues would bring back sufficient money to finance the projects, in the same way as the Tennessee Valley.	0
ClaimBuster	2875	This is a fair plan.	0
ClaimBuster	2876	The most recent has been the one in Brighton.	1
ClaimBuster	2877	"I talked to a man just briefly there who asked me one simple question: ""Do I have reason to hope that I can someday take care of my family again?"	1
ClaimBuster	2878	You talk about eight years?	0
ClaimBuster	2879	We have to make sure that we make it easier for kids to afford college.	0
ClaimBuster	2880	I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.	0
ClaimBuster	2881	That's a 30 percent reduction in the portion that the federal government contributes to education in just eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	2882	He shouldn't have made that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	2883	Perhaps Mrs. Truman can, but I don't think I can.	0
ClaimBuster	2884	We have been successful in Portugal, where a year ago it looked like there was a very great possibility that the uh - Communists would take over in Portugal.	1
ClaimBuster	2885	"And, yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, and -- just like we went after bin Laden, while you were doing ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" and we brought him to justice."	1
ClaimBuster	2886	You couldn't have people opening up banks in their -- in their garage and making loans.	0
ClaimBuster	2887	Social Security was due to go bankrupt before 1983.	1
ClaimBuster	2888	He saw the wisdom -- until the Democrat primary came along and Howard Dean, the anti-war candidate, began to gain on him, and he changed positions.	1
ClaimBuster	2889	We're expanding veterans' health care throughout the country.	1
ClaimBuster	2890	And the Republicans in recent years - not only in the last twenty-five years, but in the last eight years - have opposed housing, opposed care for the aged, opposed federal aid to education, opposed minimum wage and I think that record tells something.	1
ClaimBuster	2891	Every day is earth day if you own the land.	0
ClaimBuster	2892	And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.	1
ClaimBuster	2893	We need a lot of things.	0
ClaimBuster	2894	But it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it.	0
ClaimBuster	2895	Under the windfall profits tax, we expect to spend about $43 billion in the next 10 years to rebuild the transportation systems of our country.	1
ClaimBuster	2896	I think I should also add that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, if he intends to carry out his platform - the one adopted in Los Angeles - it is just impossible for him to make good on those promises without raising taxes or without having a rise in t- prices or both.	0
ClaimBuster	2897	But you know, one of the real catalysts, really the match that lit this fire was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.	0
ClaimBuster	2898	Now, it's not the most efficient way to get people health care.	0
ClaimBuster	2899	And I was reminded of what that would mean if those were my kids.	0
ClaimBuster	2900	I was an altar boy.	1
ClaimBuster	2901	It's to make health care affordable and available this way.	0
ClaimBuster	2902	So we have to use our great people.	0
ClaimBuster	2903	Her donors took massive tax write-offs.	1
ClaimBuster	2904	When it comes to Social Security, as I said, you don't need a major structural change in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	2905	I know we can do better.	0
ClaimBuster	2906	And I'd love to be out of workers and have to import them, like some of our international competitors.	0
ClaimBuster	2907	I completely sustained the treaty.	1
ClaimBuster	2908	We ought to have rural enterprise zones.	0
ClaimBuster	2909	So they want the economy to work and the world to be free and open.	0
ClaimBuster	2910	And the fact that you're making an investment in higher education is critical.	1
ClaimBuster	2911	Now, just a few days ago a bipartisan commission of Republicans and Democrats -- more Republicans than Democrats -- said my plan will save the average family $1200 a year more than the Bush plan will by the year 2000, $2.2 trillion in the next 12 years, $400 billion a year by the end of this decade.	1
ClaimBuster	2912	But I think we've got to be very careful in balancing the ethics and the science.	0
ClaimBuster	2913	And, you know, I appreciate and it appears we've got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	2914	If we can get it done in the first year, you bet.	0
ClaimBuster	2915	Earlier this year, in the first quarter, we did have a very severe inflation pressure brought about by the OPEC price increase.	1
ClaimBuster	2916	Let's talk about civil rights.	0
ClaimBuster	2917	"Pick that person in November because believe me, as I've said before, ""The party's over and it's time for the clean-up crew."""	1
ClaimBuster	2918	We need a heritage trust program, similar to the one we had in Georgia, to set aside additional lands that have uh - geological and archeological importance, uh natural areas for enjoyment.	0
ClaimBuster	2919	I've picked a lot of people.	1
ClaimBuster	2920	And you can have the right kind of experience and the wrong kind of experience.	0
ClaimBuster	2921	I supported what we did in Kosovo.	1
ClaimBuster	2922	I consider myself in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of Presidents who served before me.	0
ClaimBuster	2923	And contrary to what the President says, I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful.	0
ClaimBuster	2924	We're ahead of all of the Western European country.	1
ClaimBuster	2925	But because I still believe that there is some discrimination and that not everybody has an opportunity to prove they're qualified, I favor the right kind of Affirmative Action.	0
ClaimBuster	2926	That's why I don't think we should give nearly half of it to the wealthiest 1%, because the other 99% have had an awful lot to do with building the surplus in our prosperity.	1
ClaimBuster	2927	George, Boston Harbor was polluted for 100 years.	1
ClaimBuster	2928	That's why I think it's important for us to get loan guarantees to the automakers, but we do have to hold them responsible as well to start producing the highly fuel-efficient cars of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	2929	That's not a grand coalition.	0
ClaimBuster	2930	That before we go into the summit, before we ever meet again, I think it's important that the United States build its strength; that it build its military strength as well as its own economic strength.	0
ClaimBuster	2931	But understand that there's a lot of cruelty around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	2932	And what I now want to do is to hire more teachers, especially in math and science, because we know that we've fallen behind when it comes to math and science.	0
ClaimBuster	2933	Let me mention something else the president said.	0
ClaimBuster	2934	We have 543 at present.	1
ClaimBuster	2935	And it is going to be operating at surpluses and I don't want the liberal Democratic Congress to spend out of that Social Security Trust Fund or go and take the money out for some other purpose.	0
ClaimBuster	2936	We have 100,000 to 200,000 embryos that are frozen in nitrogen today from fertility clinics.	1
ClaimBuster	2937	We're going to grow the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	2938	I believe that we have to do these things with a government that's smaller and less bureaucratic, but that we have to do them nonetheless.	0
ClaimBuster	2939	It's when you try to use that to undermine the integrity of private political -- or private religious faith and the use of the state is where -- for the most personal decisions in American life -- that's where I draw the line.	0
ClaimBuster	2940	It was the only one in the nation that furloughed murderers who had not served enough time to be eligible for parole.	1
ClaimBuster	2941	And that's why I've supported building up our capacity.	1
ClaimBuster	2942	If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if we're moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	2943	It's gotten a little nasty.	0
ClaimBuster	2944	In addition to that we've become fearful to compete with the Soviet Union on an equal basis.	0
ClaimBuster	2945	And let me just say that budget that you passed that I vetoed would have cut 50,000 kids out of Headstart.	1
ClaimBuster	2946	But that, too, will require some choices.	0
ClaimBuster	2947	We've cut it in half.	1
ClaimBuster	2948	That's what we ought to do at the federal level when it comes to grandfathered plants for utilities.	0
ClaimBuster	2949	He says he wants to give the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country a five-year $40 billion tax break, and we're going to pay for it.	1
ClaimBuster	2950	That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.	0
ClaimBuster	2951	If you have health insurance, then you don't have to do anything.	0
ClaimBuster	2952	President Reagan said no, peace through strength.	1
ClaimBuster	2953	I assume she was supportive of the decision on McDonnell Douglas, I assume she was supporting me on the decision to sell those airplanes.	0
ClaimBuster	2954	Is the person guilty of the crime?	0
ClaimBuster	2955	So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making sure that middle-class families are secure in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	2956	And if Americans trust me with the presidency, I can pledge to you, we will have the most significant effort, openly -- not secret meetings in the White House with special interests, not ideologically driven efforts to push people aside -- but a genuine effort to try to restore America's hope and possibilities by bringing people together.	0
ClaimBuster	2957	That is the best way.	0
ClaimBuster	2958	And they said no because they got a memo from one of their political advisers saying that instead they should characterize whatever we did as big government and make sure nothing was done to aid healthcare before the '94 elections so they could make that claim.	0
ClaimBuster	2959	The president's path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay.	1
ClaimBuster	2960	This is not just a women's issue, this is a family issue, this is a middle-class issue, and that's why we've got to fight for it.	0
ClaimBuster	2961	Every single country in Latin America, Central America and the Caribbean is a democracy tonight but Cuba.	1
ClaimBuster	2962	Yes, we have fundamental differences.	0
ClaimBuster	2963	I'm not going to go around the country saying he didn't tell the truth, when he looked at the same intelligence I did.	0
ClaimBuster	2964	He feels that we're moving ahead uh - in a - we're not going into a recession in this country, economically; he feels that our power and prestige is stronger than it ever was relative to that of the Communists, that we're moving ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	2965	We've had 12 years of trickle down economics.	1
ClaimBuster	2966	And we're going to make sure people get punished for the crime.	0
ClaimBuster	2967	That's the problem with it.	0
ClaimBuster	2968	The worst thing is, again, it's a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	2969	On the international financial crises that come up, my friend, Bob Rubin, the former Secretary of Treasury is here, he's a close advisor to me and great friend in all respects.	1
ClaimBuster	2970	I said that we would provide guarantees, and -- and that was what was able to allow these companies to go through bankruptcy, to come out of bankruptcy.	1
ClaimBuster	2971	I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey.	0
ClaimBuster	2972	We have them all day every day.	0
ClaimBuster	2973	I sat there watching ad after ad after ad, false ad.	0
ClaimBuster	2974	You know, the President said he was going to cut defense $60 billion, he cut defense $112 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	2975	The average uh American person can't do it.	0
ClaimBuster	2976	Because it's God's will, whatever happens.	0
ClaimBuster	2977	But I do think that you need to make an appeal every time you can to eliminate racial divisions and discrimination, and I'll keep on doing that and pointing to some legislative accomplishment to back it up.	0
ClaimBuster	2978	How's it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college?	0
ClaimBuster	2979	It looks like a bombed-out city - great, gaunt skeletons of buildings.	0
ClaimBuster	2980	I think you can work on all three at once, Tom.	0
ClaimBuster	2981	The fact is that the president had an opportunity to stand up and take on China for currency manipulation.	1
ClaimBuster	2982	But there is no doubt that we've been living beyond our means and we're going to have to make some adjustments.	0
ClaimBuster	2983	They are a new weapons system that has a great potential, both conventional and nuclear armed.	1
ClaimBuster	2984	If we could get agreement on that, maybe they could pass that in the final days of this Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	2985	That's not specific in terms of a program.	0
ClaimBuster	2986	... people, right, not for current retirees.	0
ClaimBuster	2987	And so I don't think that you make an exception based on medical knowledge at the time.	0
ClaimBuster	2988	I'm not un-proud of it, to be honest with you.	0
ClaimBuster	2989	I think they may be using the man's own words.	0
ClaimBuster	2990	So, there are a host of other figures that reveal that the grant programs are greater than they have ever been, taking care of more people than they ever have.	1
ClaimBuster	2991	The question is will it be the strongest in the years to come?	0
ClaimBuster	2992	We've got to get after the users more.	0
ClaimBuster	2993	We feel that with this improvement in the economy; we feel with more receipts and fewer disbursements we can in a moderate way increase, as I recommended, over the next ten years a new parks program that would cast a billion and a half dollars, doubling our national park system.	0
ClaimBuster	2994	I believe we can be better.	0
ClaimBuster	2995	"And she said to me, ""You know, by finally getting bin Laden, that brought some closure to me."""	1
ClaimBuster	2996	And they agree, that if we can do what I've said, we can get it down without going and socking the American taxpayer once again.	0
ClaimBuster	2997	What he's quoting is not the Senate Budget Commiitte, it is a partisan press release by the Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee that's not worth the government -- the taxpayer-paid paper that it's printed on.	1
ClaimBuster	2998	There's some question about their morality.	0
ClaimBuster	2999	You couldn't have chosen your own doctor and that would have been the end.	0
ClaimBuster	3000	I think it's true of Latin America also.	1
ClaimBuster	3001	Outsourcing is going to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	3002	When I was in the United States Congress, I worked with former President Reagan to modernize our strategic weaponry and to pursue arms control in a responsible way.	1
ClaimBuster	3003	Five million Americans have lost their health care; 620,000 Missourians have no health care at all; 96,000 Missourians have lost their health care under President Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	3004	But above all, pick a President who will fight to avoid the day when that God-awful decision ever needs to be made.	0
ClaimBuster	3005	And Pakistan is a very important element in this.	1
ClaimBuster	3006	In fact, I have written a book about it.	1
ClaimBuster	3007	So I'm going to ask the Congress to pass a teacher protection act.	0
ClaimBuster	3008	But at the same time, I had a responsibility, and so did the National Security Coun- Council, to meet the problem at hand.	0
ClaimBuster	3009	Here's the problem: There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	3010	You know, the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks.	0
ClaimBuster	3011	We owe China $500 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	3012	I don't have a tax cut of a scale that you're talking about.	1
ClaimBuster	3013	Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own.	0
ClaimBuster	3014	It's also a departure from tax-and- spend economics, because you can't tax and divide an economy that isn't growing.	0
ClaimBuster	3015	And I would like to see Mr. Ford convince the Polish-Americans and the Czech-Americans and the Hungarian-Americans in this country that those countries don't live under the domination and supervision of the Soviet Union behind the Iron - uh - Curtain.	0
ClaimBuster	3016	He says it's a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.	0
ClaimBuster	3017	Look at where we are today.	0
ClaimBuster	3018	And in the process the negatives began.	0
ClaimBuster	3019	"I really can't believe Mr. Bush is still trying to make trust an issue after ""read my lips"" and 15 million new jobs and embracing what he called voodoo economics and embracing an export enhancement program for farmers he threatened to veto and going all around the country giving out money in programs that he once opposed."	1
ClaimBuster	3020	I'd make sure that Ahmadinejad is indicted under the Genocide Convention.	1
ClaimBuster	3021	I mean we're just a few miles away from Ellis Island.	1
ClaimBuster	3022	And we signed an agreement with North Korea that my administration found out that was not being honored by the North Koreans.	1
ClaimBuster	3023	Key thing here, see, we all come up with images.	1
ClaimBuster	3024	In the past seven years, in President Eisenhower's Administration, this situation has been reversed.	1
ClaimBuster	3025	The bill introduced and erd- sponsored by Senator Douglas was far more effective in trying to stimulate the economy of those areas.	1
ClaimBuster	3026	They are making some progress, not enough for us.	0
ClaimBuster	3027	If you're taking care of an elderly parent, you get a $1,000 deduction.	1
ClaimBuster	3028	That'll help people who want to get off welfare.	0
ClaimBuster	3029	He has no record on reforming of health care.	1
ClaimBuster	3030	One of the key points in foreign policy and national security policy is the need to re-establish the old-fashioned principle that politics ought to stop at the water's edge.	0
ClaimBuster	3031	You know, there's a lot of talk about how to keep the economy growing.	0
ClaimBuster	3032	Trying to figure out who the questioner was.	0
ClaimBuster	3033	I am not going to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	3034	Well the que- the - Mr. Griffin, I believe, who is the head of the Klan, who lives in Tampa, Florida, indicated a - in a statement, I think, two or three weeks ago that he was not going to vote for me, and that he was going to vote for Mr. Nixon.	1
ClaimBuster	3035	I think the American people have only one - uh requirement - that the facts about Mayaguez be given to them accurately and completely.	0
ClaimBuster	3036	But governors are ready; mayors are ready.	0
ClaimBuster	3037	That's a big, big difference.	0
ClaimBuster	3038	And those are my four top priorities should I be the president, not to say we won't be engaged nor work hard to get other nations to come together to prevent atrocity.	0
ClaimBuster	3039	And if we go forward with the kinds of policies that the Vice President is suggesting tonight and has in the past, that debt is going to grow bigger and bigger and bigger.	0
ClaimBuster	3040	The president's reelected you'll see dramatic cuts to our military.	0
ClaimBuster	3041	I certainly don't disagree that we ought to get our troops home from places like the Balkans as soon as we can, as soon as the mission is complete.	0
ClaimBuster	3042	Senator Kennedy quotes the record, which he read from a moment ago, but what he forgets to point out is that the key vote - a uh - vote which I've referred to several times - where he was in the minority was one which rejected his position.	1
ClaimBuster	3043	No Child Left Behind Act, I voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	3044	Under Governor Bush's tax cut proposal, he would spend more money on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of the new spending that he proposes for education, health care, prescription drugs and national defense all combined.	1
ClaimBuster	3045	And it costs more to keep them in prison than it does to send them to Harvard.	1
ClaimBuster	3046	This whole thing has got a lot to do with Ukraine, Crimea, the base of the Russian fleet in Sevastopol.	0
ClaimBuster	3047	I've been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York.	1
ClaimBuster	3048	or we passed one bill, just a couple of weeks ago in the House of Representatives for $500 million - a half a billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	3049	I -- I have to respond to that.	0
ClaimBuster	3050	I know they've appointed a commission to take a look at managed care.	0
ClaimBuster	3051	I favor the particular constitutional amendment that would turn over to the states the uh - individual right to the voters in those states uh - the chance to make a decision by public referendum.	0
ClaimBuster	3052	Well, I guess the president and you and I are three examples of lucky people who married up.	0
ClaimBuster	3053	I think that answers itself.	0
ClaimBuster	3054	So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past?	1
ClaimBuster	3055	We have 35 million people without any insurance at all -- and I see them all the time.	1
ClaimBuster	3056	Part of it's because you can't -- you can't control the classroom.	0
ClaimBuster	3057	And as a consequence we'll have a better trained workforce and that will create jobs because companies want to locate in places where we've got a skilled workforce.	0
ClaimBuster	3058	That's what I've been doing for the last four years.	1
ClaimBuster	3059	I believe marriage is between a man and a woman.	0
ClaimBuster	3060	But it's now time for the next stage of welfare reform, and include fathers and not only mothers.	0
ClaimBuster	3061	But I just don't want to mandate it and risk putting this - setting the recovery back.	0
ClaimBuster	3062	I grew up in a family where my father was gone most of the time because he was at sea and doing our country's business.	1
ClaimBuster	3063	He wants to unravel the six- party talks, or the five-nation coalition that's sending him a clear message.	0
ClaimBuster	3064	And believe me: We're in a bubble right now.	0
ClaimBuster	3065	I will lower taxes on middle-income families.	0
ClaimBuster	3066	But I would fight for a line-item veto, and I would certainly veto every earmark pork-barrel bill.	0
ClaimBuster	3067	"Senator McCain, this is the guy who sang, ""Bomb, bomb, bomb Iran,"" who called for the annihilation of North Korea."	1
ClaimBuster	3068	I pay for it by changing the relationship with the banks.	0
ClaimBuster	3069	We call, first of all, for the creation of a $4 billion urban reinvestment trust fund to do exactly what you spoke about in your question - to rebuild the streets, to rebuild the cities, the leaking water mains.	0
ClaimBuster	3070	Well I might say first of all that I think in case of the Carter administration the sacrifices would be much less.	0
ClaimBuster	3071	My argument with the governor is, do we want this country to go that far left.	0
ClaimBuster	3072	Let me say very categorically you cannot maintain the security of the United States with the kind of defense budget cuts that Governor Carter has indicated.	0
ClaimBuster	3073	And they're not getting in many cases adequate shelter.	0
ClaimBuster	3074	This is the scale of what President Kennedy set out to do with the nuclear test ban treaty.	0
ClaimBuster	3075	More than you spend for food, clothing and shelter combined for taxes under this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	3076	Look, there's no question but the people recognize that we have not produced more (inaudible) on federal lands and in federal waters.	1
ClaimBuster	3077	Because an enemy realizes the stakes.	0
ClaimBuster	3078	You want jobs in the inner city?	0
ClaimBuster	3079	They know the Republican Party hasn't done it.	0
ClaimBuster	3080	But you know, they're the ones that, with the encouragement of Senator Obama and his cronies and his friends in Washington, that went out and made all these risky loans, gave them to people that could never afford to pay back.	1
ClaimBuster	3081	I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that I care very much about.	1
ClaimBuster	3082	This -- what we're seeing taking place in Syria is heartbreaking, and that's why we are going to do everything we can to make sure that we are helping the opposition.	0
ClaimBuster	3083	Nor is the question that all Americans want peace and security an issue in this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	3084	I'm not going to, because that would be pandering.	0
ClaimBuster	3085	We've got to have a president who is going to be advocating on behalf of American businesses and American workers and I make no apology for that.	0
ClaimBuster	3086	And those are the people that I will appoint.	0
ClaimBuster	3087	It's almost like going back to the Malthusian theory, when even then they were saying that everyone would starve with the limited population they had then.	0
ClaimBuster	3088	Then there was another bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the state of Illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, one of the late-term abortion, a really -- one of the bad procedures, a terrible.	1
ClaimBuster	3089	It would be an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to come in, to come into Latin America and to engage us in what would be a civil war, and possibly even worse than that.	0
ClaimBuster	3090	We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton's plan.	1
ClaimBuster	3091	The program which I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have put medical care for the aged in Social Security, and would have been paid for through the Social Security System and the Social Security tax.	1
ClaimBuster	3092	I have been in public service for 24 years, Jim.	1
ClaimBuster	3093	I don't agree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	3094	Every other ca- African country either abstained or voted against us.	1
ClaimBuster	3095	I came through small business.	1
ClaimBuster	3096	Every dollar that I've proposed, I've proposed an additional cut so that it matches.	1
ClaimBuster	3097	You know, I think it's -- that's going to be up to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	3098	Now, I think those are the wrong priorities.	0
ClaimBuster	3099	It has stood for progress; it has stood for concern for the people's welfare.	0
ClaimBuster	3100	And by the way, I've had that experience.	1
ClaimBuster	3101	I believe strongly in a teacher protection act like I mentioned.	0
ClaimBuster	3102	In fact, 1992 we had a bill come before us that all the states had to comply or they're going to lose certain money.	1
ClaimBuster	3103	And I think right now we got to go back.	0
ClaimBuster	3104	And we've got to give them a chance.	0
ClaimBuster	3105	This situation got so bad that I decided I'd better get into it.	0
ClaimBuster	3106	So the vast majority of small businesses would get a tax cut under my plan.	1
ClaimBuster	3107	And I know that I'm someone older than you.	1
ClaimBuster	3108	This has not been an ancient history story.	0
ClaimBuster	3109	And I said that at that time.	1
ClaimBuster	3110	It's his trustees, the President's trustees, not mine, who says it's going to go broke.	0
ClaimBuster	3111	It's also important that we look at the entire global situation.	0
ClaimBuster	3112	Our exports are dramatically up.	1
ClaimBuster	3113	And that's exactly what we're going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	3114	I think the record should show, Mr. Newman, that uh - the Bureau of Census - we checked it just yesterday - indicates that uh - in the four years that uh - Governor Carter was governor of the state of Georgia, uh - expenditures by the government went up over 50 percent Uh - employees of the government in Georgia during his term of office went up over 25 percent; and the figures also show that the uh, uh - bonded indebtedness of the state of Georgia during his governorship went up over 20 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	3115	I'm not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights.	0
ClaimBuster	3116	It's important for NATO to be strong and confident and to help keep the peace in Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	3117	But do we want a constitutional amendment adopted of the kind proposed by the President that gets the local politicians into the business of selecting prayers that our children must either recite in school or be embarrassed and asked to excuse themselves?	0
ClaimBuster	3118	President Obama was right, he said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years.	1
ClaimBuster	3119	And that will be my policy.	0
ClaimBuster	3120	So we're losing our good jobs, so many of them.	0
ClaimBuster	3121	Well, I want to do the same thing, but I've actually identified how we can do that.	0
ClaimBuster	3122	The reason why Prime Minister Allawi said they're coming across the border is because he recognizes that this is a central part of the war on terror.	1
ClaimBuster	3123	Uh - we'll have uh - a safety version built in with complete reorganization of the executive branch of government which I am pledged to do.	0
ClaimBuster	3124	No, I think -- I had five seconds before you interrupted me, was ...	1
ClaimBuster	3125	I've touched more people's lives and seen more heartbreak and hope, more pain and more promise, than anybody else who's run for president this year.	0
ClaimBuster	3126	And I'm fighting to let you get those drugs from Canada, and I'm fighting to let Medicare survive.	1
ClaimBuster	3127	And I've worked hard for a long time to make them better, 90 percent of our kids are there.	1
ClaimBuster	3128	But Russia has been expanding their -- they have a much newer capability than we do.	1
ClaimBuster	3129	Federal government has gone down, Texas's government has gone up.	1
ClaimBuster	3130	What we need to do is make certain we try to return people to work.	0
ClaimBuster	3131	Now the second point we have to understand is this, however.	0
ClaimBuster	3132	This is ridiculous and it ought to be changed.	0
ClaimBuster	3133	On November second all of you will make a very, very important decision.	1
ClaimBuster	3134	No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody.	0
ClaimBuster	3135	I want to have an education system that sets high standards, local control of schools and strong accountability.	0
ClaimBuster	3136	And we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so I know how to do this because I've been involved these issues for many, many years.	1
ClaimBuster	3137	We worked too hard to lower it.	0
ClaimBuster	3138	And so we're moving troops out of Europe and replacing it with more effective equipment.	1
ClaimBuster	3139	And the B - 1 is similarly to be opposed, because for 15 years the Soviet Union has been preparing to meet the B - 1.	1
ClaimBuster	3140	They ought to be engaged in breaking ground in other technologies, doing waste recycling, clean water technology and things of that kind.	0
ClaimBuster	3141	I'd like to create more millionaires than were created under Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan, but I don't want to have 4 years where we have no growth in the private sector, and that's what's happened in the last 4 years.	1
ClaimBuster	3142	And that requires us to make some important choices.	0
ClaimBuster	3143	You know, a generation of office seekers has tried to tell the American people that they could get something for nothing.	0
ClaimBuster	3144	I also think we ought to continue to have good adoption law as an alternative to abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	3145	I think it's very important that we protect marriage as an institution, between a man and a woman.	0
ClaimBuster	3146	But they know what's going on.	0
ClaimBuster	3147	They look at our -- our decision to -- to cut back on our military capabilities.	0
ClaimBuster	3148	I've been to these national parks.	1
ClaimBuster	3149	We never initiated any kind of action; we defended ourselves there.	1
ClaimBuster	3150	No one else believes that's the case.	0
ClaimBuster	3151	I'm really strongly committed to clean water and clean air, and cleaning up the new kinds of challenges like global warming.	0
ClaimBuster	3152	The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems.	0
ClaimBuster	3153	We're not giving this away for nothing.	0
ClaimBuster	3154	You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.	0
ClaimBuster	3155	And one of the things I've tried hardest to do is to tell the American people that we have to get beyond that, we have to understand that we're stronger when we unite around shared values instead of being divided by our differences.	0
ClaimBuster	3156	More Americans at work today than at any time in the history of the country, and a greater percentage of the work force.	1
ClaimBuster	3157	And what I'm afraid of is we've watched over the past year or so, first the president saying, well we'll let the U.N. deal with it.	0
ClaimBuster	3158	I respectfully submit that Senator Kennedy too often would rely too much on the federal government, on what it would do to solve our problems, to stimulate growth.	0
ClaimBuster	3159	But under Governor Romney's definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	3160	There are a million and a half people out there standing in line waiting to adopt children who can't have them any other way.	1
ClaimBuster	3161	If you have extraordinarily high cost, then they pay all over $4,000 out-of-pocket.	1
ClaimBuster	3162	And, again, Bernie Sanders, it's really bad judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	3163	I see jihadists continuing to spread, whether they're rising or just about the same level, hard to precisely measure, but it's clear they're there.	1
ClaimBuster	3164	I believe strongly in the defense of Formosa.	0
ClaimBuster	3165	They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history.	1
ClaimBuster	3166	And now we are putting up a defense of our own.	1
ClaimBuster	3167	But we have never been willing to do anything that, in effect, surrendered freedom any place in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	3168	You've been president four years.	1
ClaimBuster	3169	As you notice, he starts talking about government.	1
ClaimBuster	3170	If you care about it, why don't you veto it?	0
ClaimBuster	3171	It is about what's happening right now in America.	0
ClaimBuster	3172	The Bureau of Labor Statistics today said they made a mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	3173	They would know all about our problems.	0
ClaimBuster	3174	That bill did -- there was another bill that did die in committee.	1
ClaimBuster	3175	It's wonderful that Libya seems to be making some progress, despite this terrible tragedy.	0
ClaimBuster	3176	And, Senator, I remind you that a few years ago when I supported teacher testing while in my home state I was pretty well lambasted by the teachers association.	1
ClaimBuster	3177	We've turned it into a weakness.	0
ClaimBuster	3178	But under no circumstances must the United States ever make an agreement based on trust.	0
ClaimBuster	3179	I know it will require a different kind of leader to go to Washington to say to both Republicans and Democrats, let's come together.	0
ClaimBuster	3180	Yes, we have an increase in the defense budget.	1
ClaimBuster	3181	Mr. Ford has - has advocated since he's been in office over $5 billion in reductions for corporations, special interest groups, and the very, very wealthy who derive their income - not from labor - but from investments.	1
ClaimBuster	3182	He hasn't saved $9 billion with his vetoes.	1
ClaimBuster	3183	Now, in the short-term we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price from OPEC when they want to raise the price.	1
ClaimBuster	3184	I believe in our country.	0
ClaimBuster	3185	But the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have.	0
ClaimBuster	3186	I favor that because I believe that's the best way to aid our schools without running any risk whatever of the federal government telling our teachers what to teach.	0
ClaimBuster	3187	"""No, we're spending your money."	1
ClaimBuster	3188	It does what the GI Bill itself did when I came out of World War II.	0
ClaimBuster	3189	He put forward No Child Left Behind.	1
ClaimBuster	3190	But that's true throughout our whole governmental society.	0
ClaimBuster	3191	Well, it's awful easy when you're dealing with 90-90 hindsight.	0
ClaimBuster	3192	I'm sorry that we couldn't persuade the bringing in of the third candidate, so that he could have been seen also in these debates.	1
ClaimBuster	3193	And so, I would pick people that would be strict constructionists.	0
ClaimBuster	3194	And it's now the smallest number that we have had since the -- the smallest in size since John Kennedy's administration.	1
ClaimBuster	3195	But I was wrong because I thought the tax compromise, going along with 1 Democratic tax increase, would help the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	3196	- reducing the interest rate.	0
ClaimBuster	3197	You must always remember that a president can't stop anything unless he has the people behind him.	0
ClaimBuster	3198	And this was why the provisions that we had in with regard to sanctions, and so forth -- and I'm going to do everything I can, and all of us in the administration are, to join in again when Congress is back at it to get an immigration bill that will give us, once again, control of our borders.	0
ClaimBuster	3199	Well, I've got a plan to do something about that.	0
ClaimBuster	3200	The Nationalists have these two islands.	1
ClaimBuster	3201	I think of all the people I grew up with and went to school with and who I stay in touch with and who nerve let me forget how what we do in Washington affects all of you out there in America.	0
ClaimBuster	3202	They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan.	1
ClaimBuster	3203	And the people who have jobs --	0
ClaimBuster	3204	What's he say to Tony Blair?	0
ClaimBuster	3205	Free nations will answer the hopes and aspirations of their people.	0
ClaimBuster	3206	I don't think we've got a person to waste and I think I owe the American people a White House staff, a Cabinet and appointments that look like America but that meet high standards of excellence, and that's what I'll do.	0
ClaimBuster	3207	It - the next Congress will probably be the first billion-dollar Congress in the history of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	3208	And we start -- we don't do it exclusively -- but we start by rolling back George Bush's unaffordable tax cut for the wealthiest people, people earning more than $200,000 a year, and we pass, hopefully, the McCain-Kerry Commission which identified some $60 billion that we can get.	1
ClaimBuster	3209	I think we're making progress here.	0
ClaimBuster	3210	The stock market was declining six months prior to my arrival.	1
ClaimBuster	3211	As the record develops, I think it's going to become increasingly clear that what I am saying and where I want to take this country is exactly where the country wants to go, and the comparison of approaches is such that I think will lead to further strength.	0
ClaimBuster	3212	The Vice President mentioned my view of long-term for the military.	1
ClaimBuster	3213	And I am confident that Assad's days are numbered.	0
ClaimBuster	3214	Let's get on with it.	0
ClaimBuster	3215	If affirmative action means what I just described what I'm for, then I'm for it.	0
ClaimBuster	3216	Another one would be a number of subsidies for ethanol.	0
ClaimBuster	3217	And I'm very very proud of that choice.	0
ClaimBuster	3218	And of course, this debate also takes place at a time when the tragedy of the USS Cole is on our minds and hearts and insofar as the memorial service is tomorrow, I would like to also extend sympathy to the families of those who have died and those who are still missing, and the injured.	1
ClaimBuster	3219	And domestic sources that are cleaner and better.	0
ClaimBuster	3220	I want to add more free trade agreements so we'll have more trade.	0
ClaimBuster	3221	We haven't been doing enough of that.	0
ClaimBuster	3222	We welcome people coming to this country as immigrants.	1
ClaimBuster	3223	That's how we get growth and how we balance the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	3224	We're cutting taxes for the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	3225	That is what it is.	0
ClaimBuster	3226	Now, General Petraeus had a strategy, the same strategy -- very, very different, because of the conditions and the situation -- but the same fundamental strategy that succeeded in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	3227	And therefore, the term honest broker makes sense.	0
ClaimBuster	3228	Howard, I'm a Southerner, and I share the basic beliefs of my region that an excessive government intrusion into the private affairs of American citizens and also into the private affairs of the free enterprise system.	1
ClaimBuster	3229	That's been his philosophy in the private sector, that's been his philosophy as governor, that's been his philosophy as a presidential candidate.	0
ClaimBuster	3230	See, the first thing we have to do is get you a job.	0
ClaimBuster	3231	We might have to do it slowly.	0
ClaimBuster	3232	You bet there's things that government can do.	0
ClaimBuster	3233	One of the reasons, and I first would like to know which programs you're talking about, and then we could talk on the merits of the programs.	0
ClaimBuster	3234	And so, the plan he talks about simply won't work.	0
ClaimBuster	3235	That is absolutely not true.	0
ClaimBuster	3236	It's driven by, what are we going to need to keep the American people safe?	0
ClaimBuster	3237	Can you add five seconds, Bernie, out of fairness?	0
ClaimBuster	3238	Making sure we've got an army of reading volunteers, trained people to teach with parents and teachers so that our eight year olds can learn to read.	0
ClaimBuster	3239	I think the farm bill that he criticizes was good legislation, outstanding legislation.	0
ClaimBuster	3240	My opponent said this war is a matter of intelligence and law enforcement.	1
ClaimBuster	3241	Why do we have a depletion allowance?	0
ClaimBuster	3242	But we ought to have an aggressive effort to make sure people are educated, to make sure when they get out of high school there's Pell Grants available for them, which is what we've done.	0
ClaimBuster	3243	And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	3244	In order for the sanctions to be effective, we should have been working with the British, French and Germans and other countries.	0
ClaimBuster	3245	Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict.	0
ClaimBuster	3246	We have to press the Afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people.	0
ClaimBuster	3247	If you're re-elected, we'll get to a trillion-dollar debt.	1
ClaimBuster	3248	My -- my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	3249	See, I don't believe any other country can pick up the mantel.	0
ClaimBuster	3250	New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses.	0
ClaimBuster	3251	You can't have kids coming out of college, half of them can't find a job today, or a job that's commensurate with their college degree.	1
ClaimBuster	3252	To get it, to get $150 billion in new taxes, you got to go down to the guy that's making $36,600.	0
ClaimBuster	3253	But he's in the arena.	0
ClaimBuster	3254	I have number 1 and 1A.	1
ClaimBuster	3255	These uh - characteristics of our country have been endangered under Mr. Ford.	0
ClaimBuster	3256	Let's just talk about the CAFE standards -- that's the fuel efficiency standards.	1
ClaimBuster	3257	But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of.	0
ClaimBuster	3258	I think it's going to be difficult; but I'm confident that this country can meet its responsibilities.	0
ClaimBuster	3259	And some domestic programs as well, Andrea.	0
ClaimBuster	3260	Four thousand people a day are coming across the border.	1
ClaimBuster	3261	After all, a lot of the energy is produced from the Middle East, and so I appreciate what the administration is doing.	1
ClaimBuster	3262	I think if we had stuck by that position last winter, we would have been in a better position in May.	0
ClaimBuster	3263	The president says I've changed my mind.	1
ClaimBuster	3264	I don't see how you can lead troops if you say it's the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time.	0
ClaimBuster	3265	And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest.	1
ClaimBuster	3266	You cannot make concessions to terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	3267	Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	3268	But, as I said, we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	3269	Thirty years ago there were three police officers on the street for every crime; today there are three crimes for every police officer.	1
ClaimBuster	3270	What we need is people to stop talking and start doing.	0
ClaimBuster	3271	I mean, we can remember when President Kennedy in the Cuban missile crisis sent his secretary of state to Paris to meet with DeGaulle.	1
ClaimBuster	3272	And this is the first president in 72 years to preside over an economy in America that has lost jobs, 1.6 million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	3273	We weren't guaranteeing anything, anybody anything except the chance to prove they were qualified, the chance to prove that they could do it.	0
ClaimBuster	3274	I know what it's like to be in a hospital.	0
ClaimBuster	3275	Well, we finally passed the Kassebaum bill.	1
ClaimBuster	3276	It's sort of their golden oldie, you know.	0
ClaimBuster	3277	Let me tell you what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll do.	0
ClaimBuster	3278	In fact, they have got a commission right now in Congress, a bipartisan commission, looking at all the different options they will present to the next Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	3279	This is an essential that we get it right.	0
ClaimBuster	3280	It will probably happen in the year 2012 or 2015.	0
ClaimBuster	3281	"He said, ""The buck stops here.''"	1
ClaimBuster	3282	It's our job to fix the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	3283	I'm talking about our willingness to bear any burdens in order to maintain our own freedom and in order to meet our freedom around the globe.	0
ClaimBuster	3284	The other thing we have to do, though, is we've got to see around the corners.	0
ClaimBuster	3285	We have to persuade these other countries not to restrict our goods coming in, not to act as if there was a dollar gap; and third, we have to persuade them to assume some of the responsibilities that up till now we've maintained, to assist underdeveloped countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia make an economic breakthrough on their own.	0
ClaimBuster	3286	They get $25,000 a year income, that makes them ineligible.	1
ClaimBuster	3287	And then came some other program, and then came healthcare, and then came the tax increase and a lot of these things stopped in 1994 because then the Congress changed, and I think we've done a good job.	0
ClaimBuster	3288	We want to help pay for you to gain the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	3289	The code ought to encourage marriage, not discourage marriage.	0
ClaimBuster	3290	Have you looked at your pension?	0
ClaimBuster	3291	The interest rates have come down about 9 or 10 points and, we think, must come down further.	1
ClaimBuster	3292	The initial cost is about $54 billion, and then when you add in the additional costs - not only the construction of the system, the missiles and the personnel, and so on - when you add in the additional costs over the lifecycle of that system, over $100 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	3293	Pretty divided in the 2000 election.	0
ClaimBuster	3294	We also have seen Mr. Ford exclude himself from access to the public.	1
ClaimBuster	3295	We'll lose it when it's taken out of our paycheck before we even get it.	0
ClaimBuster	3296	But it was a tremendous shift from administrative jobs into the delivery of services.	1
ClaimBuster	3297	But the policies he's put in place from Obamacare to Dodd-Frank to his tax policies to his regulatory policies, these policies combined have not let this economy take off and grow like it could have.	1
ClaimBuster	3298	I think at the time, the mistake that was made was signing off on the deal late on Saturday night in the middle of the night.	0
ClaimBuster	3299	I want think they want somebody with common sense who can do what's best for the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	3300	They're always very loyal to us, and I appreciate that.	0
ClaimBuster	3301	We have elections so people can make decisions about this.	0
ClaimBuster	3302	If they just left the Clean Air Act all alone the way it is today, no change, the air would be cleaner than it is if you pass the Clear Skies act.	0
ClaimBuster	3303	The president of the US was told officially it was a $20-billion problem.	1
ClaimBuster	3304	And the main reason we'll succeed is because the Iraqis want to be free.	0
ClaimBuster	3305	Does it create jobs, raise incomes, and further our national security?	0
ClaimBuster	3306	We had a guarantee on the S&Ls, right?	0
ClaimBuster	3307	Well, now let's look at these bills that the Vice President suggests were too extreme.	0
ClaimBuster	3308	So that's just another one of those little fruit-loopy things they make up to try to, instead of facing issues, to try to redefine a person that's running against them.	0
ClaimBuster	3309	What you did -- and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	3310	The facts are, there - the Soviet Union relationship with Egypt is uh - at a low level.	1
ClaimBuster	3311	They were at 21.5% under Jimmy Carter, and inflation was 15.	1
ClaimBuster	3312	And I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there.	0
ClaimBuster	3313	The government was very much involved; so was the housing industry; so was the banking industry; so were housing advocates; so were non-profit agencies; so were governors and mayors and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing.	1
ClaimBuster	3314	He also said a moment ago that we would get more money to finance his programs by revising the tax laws, including depletion.	1
ClaimBuster	3315	That is the central issue of our time.	0
ClaimBuster	3316	Well, the difference is is that I can get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	3317	And it is a wonderful thing to see when you get out there among the people.	0
ClaimBuster	3318	The facts are -- I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated...	1
ClaimBuster	3319	And he's trying to make you believe it because he wants you to think I change my mind.	0
ClaimBuster	3320	That is the accepted procedure between nations; and my judgment is that we should follow the advice of Theodore Roosevelt: Be strong; maintain a strong position; but also speak softly.	0
ClaimBuster	3321	But I also believe that we've got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments.	0
ClaimBuster	3322	The Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it.	1
ClaimBuster	3323	So what does he do?	0
ClaimBuster	3324	Mr. Ford has had that same choice to make.	1
ClaimBuster	3325	You know, Elizabeth, I really respect your -- the feeling that's in your question.	0
ClaimBuster	3326	It is naive and dangerous to take a policy that he suggested the other day, which is to have bilateral relations with North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	3327	So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	3328	You've mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower.	1
ClaimBuster	3329	There are 900 sequestered in the White House.	1
ClaimBuster	3330	Capital gains rate, cut it in half, cut it 28 percent to 14 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	3331	...that's a -- I indicated...	0
ClaimBuster	3332	I think he said that Israel was a - a military burden on us and that Iran hoped to reestablish the Persian Empire.	1
ClaimBuster	3333	But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy.	1
ClaimBuster	3334	The rise of obesity amongst young Americans is one of the most alarming statistics that there is.	1
ClaimBuster	3335	We don't have free trade.	0
ClaimBuster	3336	We have seen increases in coal production and coal employment.	1
ClaimBuster	3337	We've added five hundred thousand jobs in the last two months.	1
ClaimBuster	3338	I'm no longer a public official.	1
ClaimBuster	3339	We got a big philosophical difference here tonight between one who thinks the government can do all these things through tax and spend, and one who thinks it ought to go the other way.	0
ClaimBuster	3340	They ought to have their voices heard, but they shouldn't have a big megaphone that drowns out the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	3341	Why, when you said you'd filed legislation in your first year didn't you do it?	1
ClaimBuster	3342	These people depend upon all of us for the little security that they have, and I'm not going to do it that way.	0
ClaimBuster	3343	In 1973 when there was an oil embargo, Iran did not participate.	1
ClaimBuster	3344	We cut taxes 19 times.	1
ClaimBuster	3345	"I have heard you say on one TV appearance, ""the media made me do it."""	1
ClaimBuster	3346	We discuss tonight domestic issues, but I would not want that to be any implication to be given that this does not involve directly our struggle with Mr. Khrushchev for survival.	0
ClaimBuster	3347	We're spending more money, but let's raise the standards and measure early and solve problems now, before it's too late.	0
ClaimBuster	3348	At the time, Mr. Gannon, that I made the recommendation for a $28 billion tax cut - three-quarters of it to go to individual taxpayers and 25 percent to American business.	1
ClaimBuster	3349	And when we're weak at home - weaker than all our allies - that weakness weakens the whole free world.	0
ClaimBuster	3350	We don't need to do that any more.	0
ClaimBuster	3351	We cannot afford to have a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	3352	Let me -- let me complete...	0
ClaimBuster	3353	I just don't believe we ought to be out there running down teachers and attacking them the way you did at the Republican convention.	0
ClaimBuster	3354	And at the end of that seven years we were engaged in a war in Korea which cost of thirty thousand American lives.	1
ClaimBuster	3355	I'm not some extremist out here.	0
ClaimBuster	3356	It may come as a shock for somebody who has been in Washington for so long.	0
ClaimBuster	3357	Well, first of all, I think that we are safer in some ways.	0
ClaimBuster	3358	To do that, we're taking back jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	3359	This is a very important country to us.	0
ClaimBuster	3360	I think there's a great difference between the Government of Iran threatening our diplomatic personnel, and there is a government that you can see and can put your hand on.	0
ClaimBuster	3361	The future of things that matter to you -- in terms of civil rights, what kind of Justice Department you'll have, whether we'll enforce the law.	0
ClaimBuster	3362	In Iraq, he had this cockamamie idea about dividing Iraq into three countries.	1
ClaimBuster	3363	So if you're starting a business, where would you rather start it?	0
ClaimBuster	3364	That's true of any family.	0
ClaimBuster	3365	That was a tax credit for the employer.	1
ClaimBuster	3366	As far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the -- we're defending other countries.	0
ClaimBuster	3367	And you know what they said to us?	0
ClaimBuster	3368	You're going to get a tax relief in my plan.	0
ClaimBuster	3369	That's the best way to get people back in the system.	0
ClaimBuster	3370	We've got to have no more trickle down.	0
ClaimBuster	3371	"You'll virtually -- it's virtually impossible given our regulations."""	0
ClaimBuster	3372	And what we've done when it comes to trade is not only sign three trade deals to open up new markets, but we've also set up a task force for trade that goes after anybody who is taking advantage of American workers or businesses and not creating a level playing field.	1
ClaimBuster	3373	But we have enormous differences.	0
ClaimBuster	3374	I might also add that there are decisions that are made in the Oval Office by every President which are profound in nature.	0
ClaimBuster	3375	Now, in pointing out the things that are wrong, I think we ought to emphasize America's strengths.	0
ClaimBuster	3376	And the way to make sure they understand that is by having, from the very beginning, the tightest sanctions possible.	0
ClaimBuster	3377	When he came home and he wanted to become a nurse, he had to start from scratch.	1
ClaimBuster	3378	So with all the talk about family values, I know about family values -- I wouldn't be here without them.	0
ClaimBuster	3379	Until we got a Republican Congress, we finally got action, I'm proud of my colleagues in the Republican Party for getting that done.	1
ClaimBuster	3380	I can think of nothing that will be a greater blow to the prestige of the United States among the free nations in Asia than for us to take Senator Kennedy's advan- advice to go - go against what a majority of the members of the Senate, both Democrat and Republican, did - said in 1955, and to say in advance we will surrender an area to the Communists.	1
ClaimBuster	3381	I notice that the Governor did not mention any testing.	1
ClaimBuster	3382	We've mobilized sanctions against that government.	1
ClaimBuster	3383	There were some of us -- there were some of us that stood up against it.	1
ClaimBuster	3384	But, George, that's no answer.	0
ClaimBuster	3385	I care about our kids.	0
ClaimBuster	3386	I don't believe, uh - Mr. Frankel that uh - the Yugoslavians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	3387	It was the most complete documentation by any president of any agreement signed by a president on behalf of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	3388	The truth of the matter is, we did cut the increase in spending in half.	1
ClaimBuster	3389	That's a classic example of a strategy that's embarrassed us, strengthened our opposition, and undermined the moral authority of our people and our country in the region.	0
ClaimBuster	3390	I think the first one was related to uh - the unwarranted influence of American Jews on the media and uh - in the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	3391	And you know this liberal charge, that's what their party always drags out when they get in a tight race.	0
ClaimBuster	3392	That's how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasn't advancing that cause.	1
ClaimBuster	3393	Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then?	0
ClaimBuster	3394	We convinced Libya to disarm.	1
ClaimBuster	3395	And so John likes -- John, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007.	0
ClaimBuster	3396	And I would just say that it seems to me that that's the way it ought to be.	0
ClaimBuster	3397	We cannot continue to tell the American people that we're going to build all of these systems, and at the same time, invest in important things here at home, and be serious about building a strong and good America.	0
ClaimBuster	3398	But I reserve the right, as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think it's going to keep America safe.	0
ClaimBuster	3399	She's worked on it longer than I have.	1
ClaimBuster	3400	I -- I want to invest in research.	0
ClaimBuster	3401	Well I think this Republican administration has been almost all style, and spectacular, and not substance.	0
ClaimBuster	3402	Barbara I think is doing a superb job in destroying the myth about AIDS.	0
ClaimBuster	3403	But unfortunately, in nowhere in the world is America's influence will grow.	0
ClaimBuster	3404	I started working on welfare reform in 1980 because I was sick of seeing people trapped in a system that was increasingly isolating them and making their kids more vulnerable to get in trouble.	1
ClaimBuster	3405	The fact is that this nation, in the eight years before I became President, had its own military strength decreased.	1
ClaimBuster	3406	I want to keep our neighborhoods much, much better in terms of anti-crime, and that's why I would appoint judges that have a little more sympathy for the victims of crime and a little less for the criminals.	0
ClaimBuster	3407	That happened before you came into office.	1
ClaimBuster	3408	I don't have any policy against hiring anyone; whether it's lifestyle or whatever, we don't have any policy of that kind, never have had in my office or will we have in the future.	1
ClaimBuster	3409	But I believe that we can now establish in the White House a good relationship with Congress, a good relationship with our people, set very high goals for our country.	0
ClaimBuster	3410	You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were.	1
ClaimBuster	3411	Parents are teaching their children right from wrong, and the message oftentimes gets undermined by the popular culture.	0
ClaimBuster	3412	When we took office, we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards, lack of safety features, that we stopped buying additional park land until we had rectified this with what was to be a 5-year program -- but it's just about finished already -- a billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	3413	Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate.	1
ClaimBuster	3414	Is this any reason for complacency?	0
ClaimBuster	3415	Welfare reform is one way to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	3416	It's ruled by a handful of tribes.	1
ClaimBuster	3417	I just have to respond very quickly, just to correct -- just to correct the record.	0
ClaimBuster	3418	In fact, his environmental enforcement chief air-quality person at the EPA resigned in protest over what they're doing to what they are calling the new source performance standards for air quality.	1
ClaimBuster	3419	The time line that I've set out -- and again, I want to correct the president, because he's misled again this evening on what I've said.	0
ClaimBuster	3420	I have talked to Negro mothers.	1
ClaimBuster	3421	That was certainly the case from the minute I got there.	0
ClaimBuster	3422	Now we're changing to one conflict.	1
ClaimBuster	3423	Am I allowed to respond to that?	0
ClaimBuster	3424	The United States is pursuing a new set of nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	3425	That's where the vast majority of people get their health care.	1
ClaimBuster	3426	Of course I -- I don't know Putin.	1
ClaimBuster	3427	If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails.	0
ClaimBuster	3428	I respect him for that.	0
ClaimBuster	3429	I think you can see that.	0
ClaimBuster	3430	She wants amnesty for everybody.	1
ClaimBuster	3431	So, we thought that it would be simpler to negotiate first with those.	0
ClaimBuster	3432	I do think the use of special forces, which we're using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just...	1
ClaimBuster	3433	Tipper and I have four children.	1
ClaimBuster	3434	It was wrong, and my plan for the future is better.	0
ClaimBuster	3435	Number two, with regards to Iraq, you and I agreed I believe that there should be a status of forces agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	3436	Now, the other superpowers need to do their part.	0
ClaimBuster	3437	And, above all, I want a nation that's strong.	0
ClaimBuster	3438	Our rate of uninsured, the percentage of uninsured in Texas has gone down, while the percentage of uninsured in America has gone up.	1
ClaimBuster	3439	We can lend money but we have to do it wisely.	0
ClaimBuster	3440	Now, what has been accomplished by the Helsinki agreement?	0
ClaimBuster	3441	We have to bring back respect to law enforcement.	0
ClaimBuster	3442	All across our country -- go to Ohio, 1.4 million Ohioans have no health insurance, 114,000 of them lost it under President Bush; Wisconsin, 82,000 Wisconsinites lost it under President Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	3443	I was in Kyoto, and I was part of that.	1
ClaimBuster	3444	The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business.	1
ClaimBuster	3445	The Chinese Communists have always had a large population.	1
ClaimBuster	3446	What we need is to try to seek individualized bilateral relationships with countries, regardless of their size, and to establish world-order politics, which means that we want to preserve peace through strength.	0
ClaimBuster	3447	We can't expect entrepreneurs and businesses large and small to take their life savings or their company's money and invest in America if they think we're headed to the road to Greece.	0
ClaimBuster	3448	I've had the best healthcare from government hospitals, Army hospitals and I know its importance, but we've got to fix it.	0
ClaimBuster	3449	What explains this administration cozying up to the Argentine dictators after they took over?	0
ClaimBuster	3450	We can only get 4,000 to 5,000 into South Korea.	1
ClaimBuster	3451	Is our strength and prestige rising?	0
ClaimBuster	3452	It broke my heart to go to the flood scene in Del Rio where a fellow and his family got completely uprooted.	1
ClaimBuster	3453	It doesn't work that way when you're president.	0
ClaimBuster	3454	And I know it's been going on a long time.	0
ClaimBuster	3455	He had a Democrat House, a Democrat Senate, super majority in both Houses.	1
ClaimBuster	3456	Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders.	1
ClaimBuster	3457	We've seen progress and gains in schools that were having a terrible time.	0
ClaimBuster	3458	You know, it's just not that simple.	0
ClaimBuster	3459	I've got no illusions about that.	0
ClaimBuster	3460	So my attitude coming into office was that we are going to insist that China plays by the same rules as everybody else.	0
ClaimBuster	3461	It was a tribute after President Carter's election to the National Education Association who send a lot of delegates to the Democratic convention, who gives 99.5 percent of their money, Democrat Democrats, and the President, and a lot of the teachers send their kids to private schools or better public schools.	1
ClaimBuster	3462	You have -- wait a minute.	0
ClaimBuster	3463	If he unbalances the budget, that means you have inflation, and that will be, of course, a very cruel blow to the very people - the older people - that we've been talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	3464	If you vote one way you will have an expansion of family leave.	0
ClaimBuster	3465	Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership.	1
ClaimBuster	3466	But he raised the question of my father and said, well, your father, Prescott Bush, was against McCarthy, you should be ashamed of yourself, McCarthyism.	1
ClaimBuster	3467	On the domestic side, what we must do is have change that empowers people -- not change for the sake of change, tax and spend.	0
ClaimBuster	3468	The people I talked to their spirits were high.	0
ClaimBuster	3469	One is Governor Avell- Averell Harriman, who visited the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and the other is James Schlesinger, whom I think you accompanied to uh - China.	1
ClaimBuster	3470	Well, always in the past we've had an ability to have a strong defense and also have - to have a strong uh - domestic economy, and also to be strong in our reputation and influence within the community of nations.	0
ClaimBuster	3471	And my daughters and my wife are people who just are filled with that sense of what's right, what's wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	3472	I'm absolutely, adamently opposed to that.	0
ClaimBuster	3473	And when they have a --they a --deals that are good for us, as China started to do--the changes in China since Barbara and I lived there is absolutely amazing, in terms of incentive, in partnership and things of this nature.	0
ClaimBuster	3474	It's a terrible problems in terms of flexibility on private insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	3475	Of course he's not, but he's not gonna be better off if we grow the government, if we invest, as Governor Clinton says, invest in more government.	0
ClaimBuster	3476	Now, if you break it, you made a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	3477	The president's path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay.	1
ClaimBuster	3478	The use of diplomacy in this situation has already, well, it goes hour-by-hour and day-by-day now.	0
ClaimBuster	3479	Well, we'll include it in that.	0
ClaimBuster	3480	So I don't believe that the fact you've got that long resume or had that experience is the real question.	0
ClaimBuster	3481	And the reason, one of the major reasons why we're in the difficulties we are in today is because spending got out of control.	0
ClaimBuster	3482	It's naive and dangerous to say that.	0
ClaimBuster	3483	And in return, get one-fifth of the benefits, because most of the tax reductions go to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.	1
ClaimBuster	3484	And we've got uh - the highest unemployment we've had uh - under Mr. Ford's administration, since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	3485	Different people with different views fight with each other.	0
ClaimBuster	3486	What he's asking me is, will I have a litmus test for my judges?	1
ClaimBuster	3487	They haven't said what's going to happen, whether they're going to have it declared addictive.	1
ClaimBuster	3488	You learn a lot from financial disclosure.	0
ClaimBuster	3489	One of the things I think that really frustrates people is that so often political campaigns seem to be more about the politicians that are running than the people.	0
ClaimBuster	3490	Civilians get onto aircraft, and their luggage is X-rayed, but the cargo hold is not X- rayed.	1
ClaimBuster	3491	I think that we ought to make all schools gun free.	0
ClaimBuster	3492	I've said that I agree with the Administration policy.	1
ClaimBuster	3493	How do we pay for it?	0
ClaimBuster	3494	I think I'm a reasonably likable guy.	0
ClaimBuster	3495	And our country has no idea.	0
ClaimBuster	3496	I think it's always a tragic situation.	0
ClaimBuster	3497	I agree with some of what Mr. Bush said, but it's nowhere near enough.	0
ClaimBuster	3498	And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated.	0
ClaimBuster	3499	If we could develop a principle that would say both sides could fire all their missiles and no one would get hurt, I suppose it's a good idea.	0
ClaimBuster	3500	Here we have Cuba 90 miles from our shores, and what have we done, we passed the law that gave people a right to sue and the President postponed it for six months.	1
ClaimBuster	3501	I've appointed over 130, so I have a record.	1
ClaimBuster	3502	In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you're already getting a rebate.	1
ClaimBuster	3503	In both cases where they've done so, there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford administration.	1
ClaimBuster	3504	What I cared about is could we work together.	0
ClaimBuster	3505	Now, I've outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement at home and abroad, doubling the number of drug enforcement agents, having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th of January when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together.	1
ClaimBuster	3506	Keep the trust with the older men and women of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	3507	How in the world the president said no to that pipeline?	0
ClaimBuster	3508	These two islands are in the area of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	3509	So, it isn't that we're taking too little - from taxpayer - we're spending too much still.	0
ClaimBuster	3510	That is wholly wrong, wholly in error, and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	3511	This should continue and it can be stepped up to give them hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that I can testify they have so deeply within them.	0
ClaimBuster	3512	And therefore I think that was a sound proposal and that is why I supported it and I regret that it did not pass.	1
ClaimBuster	3513	His chief education adviser is in jail He's in jail because he betrayed the public trust.	1
ClaimBuster	3514	We have a good housing program, uh - that uh - will result in cutting uh - the down payments by 50 percent and uh - having mortgage payments uh lower at the beginning of any mortgage period.	0
ClaimBuster	3515	One of the best in advancing all kinds of benefits for children to grow up healthy and strong.	1
ClaimBuster	3516	It's absolutely the right thing to do, to have crippling sanctions.	0
ClaimBuster	3517	We don't know who the rebels are.	0
ClaimBuster	3518	I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country.	0
ClaimBuster	3519	What's involved here is the question of leadership for the whole free world.	0
ClaimBuster	3520	We are the one that worked out the prison labor deal.	1
ClaimBuster	3521	That's the kind of leadership that we need to show.	0
ClaimBuster	3522	But, the Dorgan Task Force, the bipartisan task force estimated that we could collect about $35 billion in the fifth year, $105 billion over five years, the other study even more than that	1
ClaimBuster	3523	And I want to tell you what I tell them.	0
ClaimBuster	3524	We talk about the unemployment lines.	0
ClaimBuster	3525	Because if it's just us that are imposing sanctions -- we've had sanctions in place a long time.	1
ClaimBuster	3526	I want to say, since this is the last time I'll be on a platform with my opponents, that even though I disagree with Mr. Perot on how fast we can reduce the deficit and how much we can increase taxes on the middle class, I really respect what he's done in this campaign to bring the issue of deficit reduction to our attention.	0
ClaimBuster	3527	Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down, and we will as we come up with a good, solid plan with the Congress for bringing that deficit down.	0
ClaimBuster	3528	And Social Security is not enough for a lot of people to live on, or at least is not enough for them to maintain anything like their previous lifestyle.	1
ClaimBuster	3529	But the first and most important thing is to start creating jobs in America.	0
ClaimBuster	3530	All paid for by your friends on Wall Street that gave so much money because they know you're going to protect them.	0
ClaimBuster	3531	In New Hampshire Senator Kerrey said you ought to level, you ought to tell the truth about it.	1
ClaimBuster	3532	You know, it's hard work to try to love her as best as I can, knowing full well that the decision I made caused her loved one to be in harm's way.	0
ClaimBuster	3533	If you make it as a young man, time passes.	0
ClaimBuster	3534	I don't think he would have fallen had we not used the force.	0
ClaimBuster	3535	And if we don't, we will be spending our children's money.	0
ClaimBuster	3536	And I noted that nobody was really benefitting except a very small group at the top.	0
ClaimBuster	3537	We should sustain uh - the Department of Justice in its efforts and the F.B.I., and we should be continually alert.	0
ClaimBuster	3538	Because there are millions of seniors who are living almost hand to mouth.	0
ClaimBuster	3539	We have an opportunity working together to build that future, to build a better America, to build a best America, because the best America doesn't hide.	0
ClaimBuster	3540	Because the fact is, almost everything she's done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it's been a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	3541	And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are.	0
ClaimBuster	3542	It's terrible what's going on in Chicago.	0
ClaimBuster	3543	The rest of the Western world, we are told, may see its consumption increase from 51 million barrels to about 66 million.	1
ClaimBuster	3544	We have lost over 4,000 lives.	1
ClaimBuster	3545	I don't see how you can lead this country to succeed in Iraq if you say wrong war, wrong time, wrong place.	0
ClaimBuster	3546	You need small schools, not big schools.	0
ClaimBuster	3547	"I remember sitting in the White House looking at those generals, saying, ""Do you have what you need in this war?"	0
ClaimBuster	3548	Now, with respect to immigration reform, the president broke his promise on immigration reform.	1
ClaimBuster	3549	Well, my rebuttal is I've heard the national debt blamed for a lot of things, but not for illegal immigration across our border -- [laughter] -- and it has nothing to do with it.	0
ClaimBuster	3550	Right now the president is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to research bunker-busting nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	3551	If you're a single mother making $22,000 a year and you have two children, under this tax code, for every additional dollar you make, you pay a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone making more than $200,000 a year, and that is not right.	1
ClaimBuster	3552	I mean, look at it, and that's what we're asking America to have?	0
ClaimBuster	3553	Can any American looking at the situation in Latin America feel contented with what's happening today, when a candidate for the presidency of Brazil feels it necessary to call - not on Washington during the campaign - but on Castro in Havana, in order to pick up the support of the Castro supporters in Brazil?	0
ClaimBuster	3554	That's how you create jobs and become competitive.	0
ClaimBuster	3555	I believe that to be accurate, I had 49 percent; President Ford, 39 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	3556	"Now, Mr. President, you said, ""There you go again,'' right?"	0
ClaimBuster	3557	I also support modernization of our strategic and tactical weaponry.	0
ClaimBuster	3558	That's not what I believe.	0
ClaimBuster	3559	So we always had a rule, we divided by six.	1
ClaimBuster	3560	America can help that happen.	0
ClaimBuster	3561	How do you miss $6 billion?	0
ClaimBuster	3562	Incomes are rising for the first time in a decade, the crime rates, the welfare rolls are falling, we're putting , 100,000 more police on the street.	1
ClaimBuster	3563	In the case of Helsinki, thirty-five nations signed an agreement, including the secretary of state for the Vatican - I can't under any circumstances believe that the - His Holiness, the Pope would agree by signing that agreement that the thirty-five nations have turned over to the Warsaw Pact nations the domination of the - Eastern Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	3564	And there was some very interesting testimony given by Governor Carter's successor, Governor Busby, before a Senate committee a few uh - months ago on how he found the Medicaid program when he came into office following Governor Carter.	0
ClaimBuster	3565	You said that there was no history of violence between Shia and Sunni.	1
ClaimBuster	3566	It is, though, trying to understand the heartbeat of the country.	0
ClaimBuster	3567	It's sort of like what Senator Dole did when he sponsored the Americans with Disabilities Act and said to certain stores, okay, you have to make it accessible to people in wheelchairs.	1
ClaimBuster	3568	Then have another task force on crime because, next to jobs, our people are concerned about their safety.	0
ClaimBuster	3569	The major effort we must put forward is to put our people back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	3570	Now in the last Congress - the special session of the Congress - there was a bill: one by the President, one by Senator Kennedy and members of his party.	1
ClaimBuster	3571	Uh - the polls uh - are good indications of fluctuations, but they vary widely one from another.	1
ClaimBuster	3572	But the next President of the United States will have to make some tough and difficult decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	3573	And so you saw ten grandchildren there jumping all over their grandfather at the convention.	1
ClaimBuster	3574	I think it's a cynicism in Washington and it doesn't have to be that way.	0
ClaimBuster	3575	We can eliminate our dependence on foreign oil by building 45 new nuclear plants, power plants, right away.	0
ClaimBuster	3576	But we're providing health care for our people.	1
ClaimBuster	3577	It keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have guns.	1
ClaimBuster	3578	He said I misled on Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	3579	I differ with the 2 here on that.	1
ClaimBuster	3580	And it wasn't just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldn't get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees.	1
ClaimBuster	3581	There is a connection between interest rates and inflation, but I would call to your attention that in 1981 while we were operating still on the Carter-Mondale budget that we inherited -- that the interest rates came down from 211/2, down toward the 12 or 13 figure.	1
ClaimBuster	3582	We're exhausted in terms of nuclear.	0
ClaimBuster	3583	And I recommended that to the Congress with a budget ceiling of three hundred and ninety-five billion dollars, and that would have permitted us to have a $25 billion tax reduction.	1
ClaimBuster	3584	I think they're different because they're based on prejudice and hatred, which gives rise to crimes that have not just a single victim, but they're intended to stigmatize and dehumanize a whole group of people.	0
ClaimBuster	3585	You called it the gold standard.	1
ClaimBuster	3586	I would like a balanced budget amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	3587	We're doing this all around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	3588	You know, we won that conflict in Kosovo without losing a single human life in combat, a single American life in combat.	1
ClaimBuster	3589	Well, I'll just say that the question is of experience and the question also is uh - what our judgment is of the future, and what our goals are for the United States, and what ability we have to implement those goals.	0
ClaimBuster	3590	But the last point I want to make is this.	0
ClaimBuster	3591	I am for the right, as the governor says- -I'm a sportsman and I don't think you ought to eliminate all kinds of weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	3592	And I believe on this great moral issue he should speak out and give his views clearly.	0
ClaimBuster	3593	That's been displayed again and again in a very tangible way.	1
ClaimBuster	3594	Particularly some of the smaller producers.	0
ClaimBuster	3595	I was talking about the things that have been accomplished, and that was referring to the revival of patriotism and optimism, the new spirit that we're finding all over America.	0
ClaimBuster	3596	And it wasn't very detailed.	0
ClaimBuster	3597	What is a President charged with doing when he takes his oath of office?	0
ClaimBuster	3598	You know, there have been times, Governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign, where it sounded like you thought that you'd do the same things we did, but you'd say them louder and somehow that -- that would make a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	3599	Shortly after I became president in uh - December of 1974, I met with uh - General Secretary Brezhnev in Vladivostok and we agreed to a mutual cap on the ballistic missile launchers at a ceiling of twenty-four hundred - which means that the Soviet Union, if that becomes a permanent agreement, will have to make a reduction in their launchers that they now have or plan to have.	1
ClaimBuster	3600	"I knew it wouldn't work."""	0
ClaimBuster	3601	We didn't do it faster than that because we didn't want to disrupt the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	3602	And three of those checks were my grandparents'.	1
ClaimBuster	3603	And it's not an easy problem to solve.	0
ClaimBuster	3604	I know that some churches do.	0
ClaimBuster	3605	The United States is trusted by other elements in southern Africa.	0
ClaimBuster	3606	Now looking at Senator Kennedy's credentials: he is suggesting that he will move America faster and further than I will.	0
ClaimBuster	3607	But to say that there's only one focus on the war on terror doesn't really understand the nature of the war on terror.	0
ClaimBuster	3608	What I wanna do is not to raise taxes, but to eliminate loopholes.	0
ClaimBuster	3609	And finally, whether or not there was an exit strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	3610	Let me uh - speak out very strongly.	0
ClaimBuster	3611	And so, yeah, sometimes I agree with some of these groups in Washington and sometimes I don't.	0
ClaimBuster	3612	Would we be better off building that bridge to the future together so we can all walk across it or saying you can get across yourself?	0
ClaimBuster	3613	I don't think they do, enough.	0
ClaimBuster	3614	I can understand, after the vice presidential debate, why Mr. Bush would want no more debates.	0
ClaimBuster	3615	We know that the path we're taking is not working.	0
ClaimBuster	3616	When the audit's complete, I'll do it.	0
ClaimBuster	3617	And I'll bring that pipeline in from Canada.	0
ClaimBuster	3618	The US is doing better than a lot.	1
ClaimBuster	3619	If we can stand up for our economics, we ought to be able to preserve the democratic interests of the people of China.	0
ClaimBuster	3620	The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about.	0
ClaimBuster	3621	And it's got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman who's facing this terribly difficult decision.	0
ClaimBuster	3622	It was a terrorist attack and it took a long time for that to be told to the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	3623	Why didn't she do something about it?	0
ClaimBuster	3624	We need a $2,000 credit, rebate for people, working people that don't have insurance, they can get in the marketplace and start purchasing insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	3625	It is on the ballot in this election, make no mistake about it.	1
ClaimBuster	3626	Some of them had been there before.	1
ClaimBuster	3627	I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America; to see how we're doing things; to wonder what the resident of the United States is doing; and not to look at Khrushchev, or look at the Chinese Communists.	0
ClaimBuster	3628	And he's doing a very effective job of that, in his way.	0
ClaimBuster	3629	People out there listening know what I believe.	0
ClaimBuster	3630	In the last debate,1 (FOOTNOTE) the Vice President of the United States said that I said the marines had died shamefully and died in shame in Lebanon.	1
ClaimBuster	3631	This administration has taken a meat cleaver out, in terms of Federal-assisted housing, and the record is there.	0
ClaimBuster	3632	And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership.	1
ClaimBuster	3633	Ours is a nation of refugees, a nation of immigrants.	1
ClaimBuster	3634	And thirdly, we need an earned-legalization program for people who have been here for a long time, stayed out of trouble, got a job, paid their taxes, and their kids are American.	0
ClaimBuster	3635	And if we can get this law changed, everybody should make the extraordinary effort to take these kids that are unwanted and sometimes aborted, take the - let them come to birth, and then put them in a family where they will be loved.	0
ClaimBuster	3636	Let's give low income parents the same right that people of power and prestige have in America and let them go to better schools.	0
ClaimBuster	3637	The first thing I'd do is, during political campaigns, I would urge everybody to stop trying to split this country into fragments and appeal to the differences between us and then wonder why the melting pot is all broken to pieces after November the 3rd.	0
ClaimBuster	3638	A $25 billion giveaway to the biggest corporations in America, including a $254 million refund check to Enron.	1
ClaimBuster	3639	It's a totally different point of view.	0
ClaimBuster	3640	The problem is that because the voucher wouldn't necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	3641	So the new world order to me means freedom and democracy, keep engaged, do not pull back into isolation.	0
ClaimBuster	3642	Because again this showed a lack of understanding of dictators, a lack of understanding particularly of Communists, because every time you make such a concession it does not lead to peace; it only encourages them to blackmail you.	0
ClaimBuster	3643	They've cut the Pell Grants and the Perkins loans to help kids be able to go to college.	1
ClaimBuster	3644	... about a potential nuclear -- nuclear competition in Asia, you said, you know, go ahead, enjoy yourselves, folks.	1
ClaimBuster	3645	Clearly, the president wants to leave in ambivalence or intends to undo it.	1
ClaimBuster	3646	The policies of the last eight years and -- and Washington's unwillingness to tackle the tough problems for decades has left us in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	3647	We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands, to the game refuges.	1
ClaimBuster	3648	I'm optimistic that we'll win the war on terror, but I understand it requires firm resolve and clear purpose.	0
ClaimBuster	3649	So racial profiling isn't just an issue at local police forces.	0
ClaimBuster	3650	But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.	1
ClaimBuster	3651	We've been strong, but we haven't been trigger-happy.	0
ClaimBuster	3652	Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing.	0
ClaimBuster	3653	The Patriot Act is vital -- is vital that the Congress renew the Patriot Act which enables our law enforcement to disrupt terror cells.	0
ClaimBuster	3654	But I'm going to be respectful for people, I'll tolerate people, and I support equal rights but not special rights for people.	0
ClaimBuster	3655	National security, economic strength, democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	3656	They don't want to go into a drug bust and be facing an AK-47.	0
ClaimBuster	3657	A guy named Michael runs the school.	1
ClaimBuster	3658	You heard what I was for.	0
ClaimBuster	3659	Now under my plan we'll balance the budget every year.	0
ClaimBuster	3660	But let's take an example that we know is going to make a difference in the 21st century and that's our education policy.	0
ClaimBuster	3661	Over 60 nations involved with disrupting the trans-shipment of information and/or weapons of mass destruction materials.	0
ClaimBuster	3662	And are you prepared to repudiate him now?	0
ClaimBuster	3663	That's just not true, John.	0
ClaimBuster	3664	What is more moral than for the United States under the Ford administration to take the lead in southern Africa, in the Middle East?	0
ClaimBuster	3665	They viewed their service as an opportunity to serve their country.	0
ClaimBuster	3666	We do not want to be the lowest of the low.	0
ClaimBuster	3667	I know nothing about Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	3668	I have never suggested a test where we turn over our security to any nation.	1
ClaimBuster	3669	Now, my old buddy, Joe, Joe the plumber, is out there.	0
ClaimBuster	3670	I guess my answer to that is the man is running on Medi-scare.	0
ClaimBuster	3671	I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it.	1
ClaimBuster	3672	Now, typically, what's happened is that there's been a debate between more money or reform, and I think we need both.	0
ClaimBuster	3673	And I wouldn't join it.	0
ClaimBuster	3674	But we can't do it if we are not willing to give Iraq back its country.	0
ClaimBuster	3675	And when it comes to education what I've said is we've got to reform schools that are not working.	1
ClaimBuster	3676	I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.	0
ClaimBuster	3677	I think it's very important that our cities know that they have a partner in the federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	3678	There are some really interesting technologies.	0
ClaimBuster	3679	Whether it's 6 or 5, but it looks like it's 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice.	1
ClaimBuster	3680	And we will help them with respect to developing their own economy, because ultimately what's going to make the Egyptian revolution successful for the people of Egypt, but also for the world, is if those young people who gathered there are seeing opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	3681	And they have said that they want to see Israel wiped off the map.	1
ClaimBuster	3682	And that's what people are seeing now is happening in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	3683	I know how to save billions of dollars in defense spending.	0
ClaimBuster	3684	What the Western allies did decide to do is to stop all air flights - commercial air flights - to any nation involved in terrorism or the hijacking of air planes, or the harboring of hijackers.	1
ClaimBuster	3685	And all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis.	0
ClaimBuster	3686	And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.	0
ClaimBuster	3687	Now, it's fine to say that sometimes you have to hit base camps, but when the president saw this state sponsored-fingerprints of Muammar Khadaffi on the loss of American life, he hit Libya.	1
ClaimBuster	3688	The platform suggests that it can be done through economic growth; that it can be done, in effect, with mirrors.	1
ClaimBuster	3689	It is also true that this has been a situation on our borders back through a number of administrations.	0
ClaimBuster	3690	And we're going to get the job of containing all of that nuclear material in Russia done in four years.	0
ClaimBuster	3691	That's how we make sure that everybody is willing to make a few sacrifices.	0
ClaimBuster	3692	Now we have a chance.	0
ClaimBuster	3693	And I'm blessed, as I think the president is blessed, as I said last time.	0
ClaimBuster	3694	That's part of what I'm fighting for as president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	3695	I believe that we have to eliminate the earmarks.	0
ClaimBuster	3696	His targeted tax cut is so detailed, so much fine print that it is going to require numerous IRS agents.	0
ClaimBuster	3697	Let's look at it as graded by the National Taxpayers Union and the Citizens Against Government Waste and the other watchdog organizations.	0
ClaimBuster	3698	The Soviet Union is making great gains.	0
ClaimBuster	3699	But let's not go back and keep assailing a farm bill that passed with overwhelming Democrat and Republican support.	1
ClaimBuster	3700	That was the second time.	1
ClaimBuster	3701	Jim, when I came home from prison, I saw our veterans being very badly treated, and it made me sad.	1
ClaimBuster	3702	I wrote to Secretary Paulson, I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, and told them this is something we have to deal with, and nobody did anything about it.	1
ClaimBuster	3703	I felt that if I could just get the parties together to say let's stop the violence, start talking, commit to the negotiations, that would be a plus.	0
ClaimBuster	3704	And so, not once, but twice - in 1971 - I voted on the floor of the House of Representatives against a Constitutional amendment that tried to bring prayer back into the public schools.	1
ClaimBuster	3705	Russia has decided that it's all in, in Syria.	1
ClaimBuster	3706	Our Navy is old -- excuse me, our Navy is smaller now than at any time since 1917.	1
ClaimBuster	3707	My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	3708	The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which generally doesn't support a lot of Democrats, said that this plan could lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system.	1
ClaimBuster	3709	And he was given a chance to vote, and he voted no.	1
ClaimBuster	3710	The Arabs have put pressure on Mr. Ford, and he's yielded, and has permitted a boycott by the Arab countries of American businesses who trade with Israel, or who have American Jews owning or taking part in the management of American - companies.	1
ClaimBuster	3711	Admit it, that Arkansas is doing very, very badly against any standard -- environment, support for police officers, whatever it is.	1
ClaimBuster	3712	And I will hunt down and kill the terrorists, wherever they are.	0
ClaimBuster	3713	But the Americans with Disabilities Act, speaking about sound and sensible civil rights legislation, was the most foremost piece of legislation passed in modern times, and so we do have something more than a technical problem.	0
ClaimBuster	3714	There are 9 countries that spend more than we do on public education.	1
ClaimBuster	3715	I'll get people back to work with 12 million new jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	3716	"The same front outfit organization that your campaign gave $832,000 for ""lighting and site selection."""	1
ClaimBuster	3717	We need to move on.	0
ClaimBuster	3718	And that's what we're going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	3719	You don't have good community relations in Chicago.	0
ClaimBuster	3720	I'm a Catholic, raised a Catholic.	1
ClaimBuster	3721	We want to end those conflicts to the extent humanly possible.	0
ClaimBuster	3722	"This is the person who, after we had -- we hadn't even finished Afghanistan, where he said, ""Next up, Baghdad."""	1
ClaimBuster	3723	Mr. Morgan, no matter how well we're doing in the cold war, we're not doing as well as we should.	0
ClaimBuster	3724	Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her -- took massive deductions.	1
ClaimBuster	3725	These are the weaknesses that I see, and I believe it's not just a matter of idealism.	0
ClaimBuster	3726	That's why when I became President I was determined to kind of move beyond this whole stale debate that had gone on in Washington for too long to get this country moving again.	0
ClaimBuster	3727	China can be our partner, but -- but that doesn't mean they can just roll all over us and steal our jobs on an unfair basis.	0
ClaimBuster	3728	In other words, trading with other countries.	0
ClaimBuster	3729	But I think they're going to see through it.	0
ClaimBuster	3730	He came to see me.	1
ClaimBuster	3731	And so, what I'm telling you is, is that sometimes in this world you make unpopular decisions because you think they're right.	0
ClaimBuster	3732	I have a feeling how they came.	0
ClaimBuster	3733	I regret to say that the president who called himself a uniter, not a divider, is now presiding over the most divided America in the recent memory of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	3734	Paul Tsongas, a liberal senator from Massachusetts said the dumbest thing I did was to oppose the capital gains cut.	1
ClaimBuster	3735	Well, I have much better judgment than she does.	0
ClaimBuster	3736	I've seen the strength of my nation, and I've seen the crises it approached in a tentative way.	0
ClaimBuster	3737	And we've got to maintain that pressure.	0
ClaimBuster	3738	Capital gains, one more point on that, please let's learn from history.	0
ClaimBuster	3739	But I was not for the bill that he was talking about because it was not tough enough on the criminal.	1
ClaimBuster	3740	The President answers that it didn't happen or, if it did, it was resolved later in a commission.	1
ClaimBuster	3741	The good news is, and I think it's true in Richmond, teenage use is down of cocaine, substantially, 60% in the last couple of years.	1
ClaimBuster	3742	Ladies and gentlemen, that's just not true what he said.	1
ClaimBuster	3743	I think the IMF has got a role in the world, but I don't want to see the IMF out there as a way to say to world bankers, if you make a bad loan, we'll bail you out.	0
ClaimBuster	3744	It hasn't worked, and we need fundamental change.	0
ClaimBuster	3745	In mine, I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society -- that they, not government, are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible, with an orderly society.	0
ClaimBuster	3746	Senator Obama, as a member of the Illinois State Senate, voted in the Judiciary Committee against a law that would provide immediate medical attention to a child born of a failed abortion.	1
ClaimBuster	3747	We are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people.	0
ClaimBuster	3748	We just heard the President's answer for the problems at the barracks in Lebanon, where 241 marines were killed.	1
ClaimBuster	3749	At home, we'll do everything we can to protect the homeland.	0
ClaimBuster	3750	Look -- look, it's not that hard to fix Social Security, Tom.	0
ClaimBuster	3751	And then I think of the older people who are retired.	0
ClaimBuster	3752	The president got $84 from a timber company that owns, and he's counted as a small business.	1
ClaimBuster	3753	You know, I am grateful to all of you for giving me the opportunity to serve you for these 4 years, and I seek reelection because I want more than anything else to try to complete the new beginning that we charted 4 years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	3754	It was the largest stock market correction -- one of the largest in history, which foretold a recession.	1
ClaimBuster	3755	They fought and won World War II.	1
ClaimBuster	3756	They have to remove themselves from South Ossetia and Abkhazia.	0
ClaimBuster	3757	We have to start treating teachers like the professionals that they are, and give them the respect and the kind of quality of life that will draw more people into teaching because we need a lot more teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	3758	I'll get America and North America energy independent.	0
ClaimBuster	3759	We have to let them know that we want to help them, not because we're simply trying to save our own skins, not because we're simply trying to fight Communism; but because we care for them, because we stand for freedom, because if there were no Communism in the world, we would still fight poverty and misery and disease and tyranny.	0
ClaimBuster	3760	But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.	0
ClaimBuster	3761	I think our generation of Americans has the same rendezvous.	0
ClaimBuster	3762	But the Russians must understand that these kinds of actions and activities are not acceptable and hopefully we will use the leverage, economic, diplomatic and others united with our allies, with our allies and friends in Europe who are equally disturbed as we are about their recent behaviors.	0
ClaimBuster	3763	And number three, we need to be a force for freedom and democracy and we need to use our unique position to support freedom, whether it's in Haiti or in China or in any other place, wherever the seeds of freedom are sprouting.	0
ClaimBuster	3764	There was a recent investigation of the number in Texas who got -- who were given concealed weapons permits in spite of the fact that they had records.	1
ClaimBuster	3765	You've got to look at our record.	0
ClaimBuster	3766	Well, listen, you ought to be in the White House for a day and hear what I hear and see what I see and read the mail I read and touch the people that I touch from time to time.	0
ClaimBuster	3767	You know, Mr. Bush was very grateful when I was among the Democrats who said he ought to have the authority to negotiate an agreement with Mexico.	1
ClaimBuster	3768	I don't know about -- we'll talk about that a little with Ross here in a bit.	0
ClaimBuster	3769	It's the route for them to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon, which threatens, of course, our ally, Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	3770	What happened was one of the Turkish, one of the Kurdish leaders invited him to go up north, but we felt since the whole world community had told him not to do it, that once he did it we had to do something.	1
ClaimBuster	3771	We cannot have it in our hearts.	0
ClaimBuster	3772	I'm not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid, or when our children go to school part-time shifts.	0
ClaimBuster	3773	The answer to your question is very simple about why I don't go to church.	0
ClaimBuster	3774	And the one thing that I'm absolutely clear about is that after a decade in which we saw drift, jobs being shipped overseas, nobody championing American workers and American businesses, we've now begun to make some real progress.	1
ClaimBuster	3775	We did not say to Saddam Hussein, Ross, you can take the northern part of Kuwait.	1
ClaimBuster	3776	I've watched him with the first lady, who I admire a great deal, and his daughters.	1
ClaimBuster	3777	My point is, is that my plan not only trusts seniors with options, my plan sets aside $3.4 trillion for Medicare over the next ten years.	1
ClaimBuster	3778	And for the next decade, she was haunted by that conversation.	0
ClaimBuster	3779	You can't have voluntary testing.	0
ClaimBuster	3780	Ones that can support a family.	0
ClaimBuster	3781	We've negotiated over 200 separate trade agreements.	1
ClaimBuster	3782	Why can't we have transparency, accountability, reform of these agencies of government?	0
ClaimBuster	3783	Anybody that's ever built a successful business will tell you you optimize, optimize, optimize after you've put something into effect.	0
ClaimBuster	3784	He raised the 30 years of experience, so let me just talk briefly about that.	1
ClaimBuster	3785	That's the enemy that attacked us.	1
ClaimBuster	3786	And we have a certain disproportionate responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	3787	That's why I object to the covert action in Nicaragua.	0
ClaimBuster	3788	That's what I want to focus on.	0
ClaimBuster	3789	I will defend Planned Parenthood.	0
ClaimBuster	3790	Didn't bring in enough nation.	0
ClaimBuster	3791	He forgets that in this same debate on the Formosa resolution, which he said he voted for - which he did - that he voted against an amendment, or was recorded against an amendment - and on this particular - or for an amendment, I should say - which passed the Senate overwhelmingly, seventy to twelve.	1
ClaimBuster	3792	First, as a legislative leader.	0
ClaimBuster	3793	So there's some bad things going on.	0
ClaimBuster	3794	Last report on new purchases, it's the lowest since 1982.	1
ClaimBuster	3795	Which system, Communism or freedom, will triumph in the next five or ten years?	0
ClaimBuster	3796	These high interest rates -- real rates that have doubled under this administration -- have had the same effect on Mexico and so on, and the cost of repaying those debts is so enormous that it results in massive unemployment, hardship, and heartache.	1
ClaimBuster	3797	You can't have an economy that over the last three years keeps slowing down its growth rate.	0
ClaimBuster	3798	I just happen to believe that free enterprise can do a better job of producing the things that people need than government can.	0
ClaimBuster	3799	My opponent calls it a mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	3800	Sure, you can do that with Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	3801	Did you say you're unemployed?	0
ClaimBuster	3802	Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and he's absolutely right.	0
ClaimBuster	3803	We've been successful in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	3804	We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege.	0
ClaimBuster	3805	Maybe the Vice President has an answer.	0
ClaimBuster	3806	Katie, it's a terrific question and we have a difficult situation in Pakistan.	0
ClaimBuster	3807	This is a group of killers who will not only kill here, but kill children in Russia, that'll attack unmercifully in Iraq, hoping to shake our will.	0
ClaimBuster	3808	I wrote about that in...	0
ClaimBuster	3809	Well, I'm a little confused here, because I don't see how you can grow the deficit down by raising people's taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	3810	And then fourthly, as a moral leader.	0
ClaimBuster	3811	I think anybody would have a hard time explaining that clearly in a way that makes sense to the average person.	0
ClaimBuster	3812	Obviously, I'm hoping to earn your vote, I'm hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.	0
ClaimBuster	3813	... who initiated -- actually, supports charters.	0
ClaimBuster	3814	He says that he voted for the resolution.	1
ClaimBuster	3815	It was a smart thing to do.	0
ClaimBuster	3816	Now, a lot of the trial lawyers didn't want me to sign any bill at all, but I had thought we ought to do what we could to cut frivolous lawsuits, but they wouldn't make some of the changes that I thought should be made.	0
ClaimBuster	3817	It is important for NATO to have it work.	0
ClaimBuster	3818	I choose education and health care, the environment and retirement security, and I ask for your support.	0
ClaimBuster	3819	We never should go back to that.	0
ClaimBuster	3820	I notice that Mr. Ford didn't comment on the uh - prisons in Chile.	0
ClaimBuster	3821	But I want to repeat, if you have a state that fully supports the law like we do in Texas, we're going to go after all crime.	0
ClaimBuster	3822	Well, Joe Biden, I think, is one of the finest public servants that has served in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	3823	Those are two hypo-rhetorical questions.	0
ClaimBuster	3824	But I also want to be sure that we don't leave people behind.	0
ClaimBuster	3825	He just brought up the tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	3826	What I have talked about, however, the kind of programs that I've talked about, in my judgment, are uh - fiscally sound.	0
ClaimBuster	3827	But we cannot continue to live on a credit card.	0
ClaimBuster	3828	I believe we can, for all intents and purposes, eliminate our dependence on Middle Eastern oil and Venezuelan oil.	0
ClaimBuster	3829	You know, I -- I don't look at my pension.	0
ClaimBuster	3830	Now you judge for yourselves whether or not that's fair.	0
ClaimBuster	3831	And the interest savings I would put right back into Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	3832	We also had to make sure that Moammar Gadhafi didn't stay there.	0
ClaimBuster	3833	Massachusetts doesn't have an enormous defense budget, but nevertheless, the governor raised taxes five different times.	1
ClaimBuster	3834	And when we sought to assault Social Security and Medicare, as the record shows we did, I think that was mean-spirited.	0
ClaimBuster	3835	John McCain is for me for president because he understands I have the right view in winning the war on terror and that my plan will succeed in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	3836	I didn't get to make a comment on this.	1
ClaimBuster	3837	As you hear from intelligence sources even today, the -- the insurgents are highly disparate.	0
ClaimBuster	3838	That's where we ought to go, and those are the programs we ought to review first.	0
ClaimBuster	3839	In fact, Senator McCain's campaign chairman's firm was a lobbyist on behalf of Fannie Mae, not me.	1
ClaimBuster	3840	I went to Yad Beshef (ph), the Holocaust museum there, to remind myself the nature of evil and why our bond with Israel will be unbreakable.	1
ClaimBuster	3841	She doesn't get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	3842	Well, some people look up figures, and some people make up figures.	0
ClaimBuster	3843	On non - nu- oh - uh - nonproliferation, in May of l975, I called for a conference of uh - nuclear suppliers.	1
ClaimBuster	3844	Let me say, if Senator Dole mentioned this, I just signed a bill that we got through Congress to increase the amount of pay increase we could give for military personnel and to make sure the pay increase this year was above the rate of inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	3845	But the point is that we have got to give people choice in America and not mandate things on them and give them the ability.	0
ClaimBuster	3846	He should have answered the first question.	0
ClaimBuster	3847	You know, he talks to the workers.	1
ClaimBuster	3848	Now we've been hurt in recent years in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	3849	We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations.	1
ClaimBuster	3850	And I can only tell him that we reduced, in proportion of other states, the per capita spending, the per capita size of Government - we only increased the size of Government one-twelfth what it had increased in the preceding eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	3851	And that means strong oversight, making sure that investors, taxpayers are getting their money back and treated as investors.	0
ClaimBuster	3852	That's one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank.	1
ClaimBuster	3853	And we've got a wide array of differences on those.	0
ClaimBuster	3854	So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country.	1
ClaimBuster	3855	We need a strong economy.	0
ClaimBuster	3856	Some people who say the word reform actually mean cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	3857	If you take the tax cut that the president of the United States has given -- President Bush gave to Americans in the top 1 percent of America -- just that tax cut that went to the top 1 percent of America would have saved Social Security until the year 2075.	1
ClaimBuster	3858	I made that clear when I came into office.	1
ClaimBuster	3859	Mosul is a Sunni city.	1
ClaimBuster	3860	But I don't know of any reputable scientist who believed that this system, at least as originally conceived could possibly work, this notion of some kind of astrodome over ourselves that could protect us from enemy attack.	1
ClaimBuster	3861	But let me go a step further.	0
ClaimBuster	3862	But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad, and by the way -- and by Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	3863	He has never supported any of those arms control agreements - the limited test ban, SALT I, nor the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford - and now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the Soviet Union, negotiated over a seven-year period, by myself and my two Republican predecessors.	1
ClaimBuster	3864	They're putting people out of business, men and women.	0
ClaimBuster	3865	Now with respect to what we've done with China already, U.S. exports have doubled since I came into office, to China and actually currencies are at their most advantageous point for U.S. exporters since 1993.	1
ClaimBuster	3866	We cannot solve this problem all on our own.	0
ClaimBuster	3867	So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.	1
ClaimBuster	3868	I believe we could have done better.	0
ClaimBuster	3869	And in fact, employers are looking for skilled workers.	0
ClaimBuster	3870	But in order to be able to fulfill our role in the world, America must be strong.	0
ClaimBuster	3871	And that's what my campaign is about and I'm not going to raise taxes the way Senator Obama wants to raise taxes in a tough economy.	0
ClaimBuster	3872	One, could our family endure all this business.	0
ClaimBuster	3873	Not just a state problem.	0
ClaimBuster	3874	And I make that point because that's the kind of clarity of leadership, and those decisions are not always popular.	1
ClaimBuster	3875	The governor also talks about morality in foreign policy.	1
ClaimBuster	3876	I believe that the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries because those businesses trade with Israel or because they have American Jews who are owners or directors in the company is an absolute disgrace.	0
ClaimBuster	3877	I promised that we would reduce taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	3878	Forty-seven million Americans are without health insurance in America today.	1
ClaimBuster	3879	I have no idea what you're talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	3880	I choose Blue Cross/Blue Shield.	1
ClaimBuster	3881	In Egypt we stood on the side of democracy.	1
ClaimBuster	3882	They really don't - they're not able to control their market very well.	0
ClaimBuster	3883	In addition, I'm going to double the number of Special Forces so that we can fight a more effective war on terror, with less pressure on the National Guard and Reserve.	0
ClaimBuster	3884	But I know more about this, I think, than anybody else up here because I have a brother who's a recovering drug addict.	1
ClaimBuster	3885	I will fight for middle-class families and working men and women and I will never let you down.	0
ClaimBuster	3886	I talked in our first debate about the possibilities of helping millions and millions of welfare families to get off of welfare, and I'm proud to say that we finally have a welfare reform bill And the Ruby Samsons and Dan Lawsons, hundreds of thousands of welfare mothers in this country and in my state and across the country who today are working and earning are examples of what can happen when you provide training to those welfare mothers, some daycare for their children so that those mothers can go into a training program and get a decent job.	1
ClaimBuster	3887	For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.	1
ClaimBuster	3888	So I would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on federal spending.	0
ClaimBuster	3889	He has already weighed in and helped stabilize some of the difficulties in the markets and with companies and corporations, institutions today.	1
ClaimBuster	3890	I think they saw weakness where they had expected to find American strength.	0
ClaimBuster	3891	If we build our economy the way we should, we can afford to do these things and we must do it.	0
ClaimBuster	3892	You also have investments in Chinese companies.	1
ClaimBuster	3893	If we fail then we must meet our responsibilities to ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	3894	Andrea, I don't know which George Bush I'm listening to.	0
ClaimBuster	3895	We agreed to train and arm the Muslims so they could defend themselves, the policy you had when you ran in 1992.	1
ClaimBuster	3896	"I was chairman of ""Minnesotans for Kennedy;'' President Reagan was chairman of a thing called ""Democrats for Nixon.''"	1
ClaimBuster	3897	And secondly, like my opponent, I don't agree we ought to have quotas.	0
ClaimBuster	3898	So we want to end discrimination.	0
ClaimBuster	3899	They're not taken care of.	0
ClaimBuster	3900	And it is a threat not only in this region but around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	3901	If President Brezhnev said, we will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American Presidents over a seven-year period of time, we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations, and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations, it's obvious that I, as President, and all Americans, would reject such a proposition.	0
ClaimBuster	3902	He said it would hurt the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	3903	My fellow Americans, as you heard from Bob Schieffer a moment ago, America is being tested by division.	1
ClaimBuster	3904	I would be guarded in my approach.	0
ClaimBuster	3905	Go back to the time he was, what, Texas director for George McGovern.	1
ClaimBuster	3906	I support it for the middle class, not that part of it that goes to people earning more than $200,000 a year.	0
ClaimBuster	3907	We have to have wind, tide, solar, natural gas, flex fuel cars and all that but we also have to have offshore drilling and we also have to have nuclear power.	0
ClaimBuster	3908	And the nuclear capability has been searched by the United Nations, and there hasn't been one single scintilla of evidence that there's any US technology involved in it.	1
ClaimBuster	3909	And Iran is killing ISIS.	1
ClaimBuster	3910	I would have hoped that it would have been possible to use marshals to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	3911	I am opposed to it.	0
ClaimBuster	3912	It's one of these deals where, in order to be popular in the halls of Europe, you sign a treaty.	0
ClaimBuster	3913	It's a big mistake to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	3914	You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	3915	I looked the other night.	0
ClaimBuster	3916	I have my own plan.	0
ClaimBuster	3917	So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.	1
ClaimBuster	3918	He is the one who has gotten us that first arms control agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	3919	I've already taken the pledge on cutting the deficit in half.	1
ClaimBuster	3920	And now you've got a choice.	0
ClaimBuster	3921	Now, we have just heard two or three times from the vice president: he's not going to raise taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	3922	"Take a look at the ""start up"" that they signed."	0
ClaimBuster	3923	Maybe to Senator Obama it's not a lot of money.	0
ClaimBuster	3924	And let's talk about people we do control.	0
ClaimBuster	3925	As a matter of fact, Latin America's economy is almost as big as the economy of China.	1
ClaimBuster	3926	This is an issue that -- look, it divides us.	0
ClaimBuster	3927	He made a mistake in invading Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	3928	Now we have a majority and we get a president.	1
ClaimBuster	3929	It's a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	3930	If you want me to be your president, we're going to face our problems.	0
ClaimBuster	3931	I mean, we agree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	3932	The so-called negotiation that you said I walked out on was the so-called walk in the woods between one of our representatives and one of the Soviet Union, and it wasn't me that turned it down, the Soviet Union disavowed it.	1
ClaimBuster	3933	It's not as big as yours so it doesn't take as long.	0
ClaimBuster	3934	If they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center.	0
ClaimBuster	3935	Last week, as you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report.	1
ClaimBuster	3936	We can do better in our public schools.	0
ClaimBuster	3937	They -- they say, if a patient's coming in, let's get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests.	1
ClaimBuster	3938	I would never single out food as a trade embargo item.	0
ClaimBuster	3939	We have the biggest drop in the number of people in poverty in 27 years.	1
ClaimBuster	3940	If you want to purchase health insurance, you will get help with that.	0
ClaimBuster	3941	This is indeed a very important issue.	0
ClaimBuster	3942	And, believe me, anybody that knows me understands I have a very low tolerance for non-performance also.	0
ClaimBuster	3943	They told you at the tax and budget summit that if you agreed to a tax increase, we could balance the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	3944	Many of the military experts whom I consulted on this agreed.	1
ClaimBuster	3945	Senator Obama refuses to acknowledge that we are winning in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	3946	I'm not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	3947	I know what it takes to balance budgets.	0
ClaimBuster	3948	The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	3949	I went and I volunteered, and I went to Vietnam.	1
ClaimBuster	3950	I never said any such thing.	1
ClaimBuster	3951	The European countries have a stake in not having total disorder on their doorstep.	0
ClaimBuster	3952	She doesn't do anything about anything other than talk.	0
ClaimBuster	3953	Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis.	1
ClaimBuster	3954	So I think it's worth a shot.	0
ClaimBuster	3955	I want to give small business employers a tax credit, 25%, to encourage the providing of health insurance for the employees in small businesses.	0
ClaimBuster	3956	That's what we will do.	0
ClaimBuster	3957	I think our seniors deserve a modern medical system.	0
ClaimBuster	3958	We can further the cause of equality in our nation.	0
ClaimBuster	3959	Well, thank you very much, Bob, Governor Romney, and to Lynn University.	0
ClaimBuster	3960	You just give me a job.	0
ClaimBuster	3961	That's why I think we shouldn't do it that quickly.	0
ClaimBuster	3962	The fact of the matter is...	0
ClaimBuster	3963	We have too much polling and focus groups going on in Washington today.	0
ClaimBuster	3964	We're not talking about third-world drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	3965	In the second quarter, we had dropped it down to about 13%.	1
ClaimBuster	3966	Everything is a gift from the Almighty.	0
ClaimBuster	3967	In other words, we were down to 18% of them were making -- 18- to 24-year- olds were making less than $12,000.	1
ClaimBuster	3968	I've stood up against it as secretary of state.	1
ClaimBuster	3969	We've got a society that says hey, the status quo is fine, just move them through.	0
ClaimBuster	3970	And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	3971	At that time, uh - 25 or 30 percent of the Reagan supporters said that they would not support President Ford.	1
ClaimBuster	3972	I've been waiting for years.	0
ClaimBuster	3973	And I don't intend ever to express regrets to Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else if I'm doing something that has the support of the Congress and that is right for the purpose of protecting the security of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	3974	I would hate to be running for president and think that the only way I could win would be to convince everybody how horrible things are.	0
ClaimBuster	3975	Uh - I would also suggest that insofar as his statement is concerned, that I think it would be improper for the President of the United States to disclose uh - the instances in which members of his official family had made recommendations, as I have made them through the years to him, which he has accepted or rejected.	0
ClaimBuster	3976	"And we'll get you home as soon as the mission's done, because this is a vital mission."""	0
ClaimBuster	3977	But I do think we ought to have a cohesive economic policy with at - at least the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and the president's terms being uh - the same and letting the Congress, of course, be the third uh - entity with uh - with independence subject only to the president's veto.	0
ClaimBuster	3978	The fact is that the president is driving the largest deficits in American history.	1
ClaimBuster	3979	My grandmother, she started off as a secretary in a bank.	1
ClaimBuster	3980	But we're also going to have to look at, how is it that we shredded so many regulations?	0
ClaimBuster	3981	They would have gone through a...	0
ClaimBuster	3982	The other point that I would make with regard to economic assistance and technical assistance is that the United States must not rest its case here alone.	0
ClaimBuster	3983	And the test is not whether you're spending more money.	0
ClaimBuster	3984	And it's not my money.	0
ClaimBuster	3985	I apologize, Mr. Vice President.	0
ClaimBuster	3986	We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.	0
ClaimBuster	3987	I have had it in every single proposal I've sent to the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	3988	There are limits to this nation's ability to finance these weapons systems.	0
ClaimBuster	3989	So we want to promote those principles around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	3990	You've got every rich Middle Eastern country over there trying to buy nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	3991	And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	3992	And an Iranian nuclear program is not acceptable to us.	0
ClaimBuster	3993	And it's really a shame.	0
ClaimBuster	3994	Look what's happening in Syria, in Egypt, now in Libya.	0
ClaimBuster	3995	Look, I look at what's happening around the world, and i see Iran four years closer to a bomb.	0
ClaimBuster	3996	Well, anybody that thinks about it cares a great deal.	0
ClaimBuster	3997	That's what worries me --	0
ClaimBuster	3998	And we are winning in Iraq, and we will come home.	0
ClaimBuster	3999	I don't believe it is.	0
ClaimBuster	4000	So that's one reason I don't want it.	0
ClaimBuster	4001	And that's one of the reasons I've said before, and I'll pledge here tonight, if I'm president, the very first bill that Joe Lieberman and I will send to the United States Congress is the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill.	0
ClaimBuster	4002	I think after three debates the good people of this country understand there is a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	4003	That would be my position.	0
ClaimBuster	4004	But when there's uh - a very narrow decision - which quite often there's one that reaches the Supreme Court - I think the choice should be with human rights.	0
ClaimBuster	4005	For example, we have reduced the size of the Federal government to its smallest size in 30 years.	1
ClaimBuster	4006	And what we have in Lebanon is something that the American people have seen.	0
ClaimBuster	4007	That was, of course, out-of-bounds by the Democrats.	0
ClaimBuster	4008	And I've had to deal with those crises as best I could.	0
ClaimBuster	4009	Now, having that, I think also that in leadership -- well, I believe that you find people, positions such as I'm in who have the talent and ability to do the things that are needed in the various departments of government.	0
ClaimBuster	4010	I think if the United States is maintaining a strong society here in the United States, I think that we can meet any internal threat.	0
ClaimBuster	4011	OK, what -- what would I cut?	0
ClaimBuster	4012	On Iran, I hope we can do the same thing, continue to work with the world to convince the Iranian mullahs to abandon their nuclear ambitions.	0
ClaimBuster	4013	I've got a plan to increase the wetlands by 3 million.	0
ClaimBuster	4014	And to make health care more affordable, allow business associations like the National Federal of Independent Business or the Chamber of Commerce or the National Restaurant Association to write association plans across jurisdictional lines so that small businesses have got the capacity to have national pooling to drive the cost of insurance down.	1
ClaimBuster	4015	This is the administration that fought the balanced budget amendment and vetoed a balanced budget and vetoed welfare reform twice, and the list goes on and on and on, that's what I had in mind.	1
ClaimBuster	4016	It must be a test of a man.	0
ClaimBuster	4017	His leading advisor on this plan actually said that would be okay, because then the Social Security Trust Fund could start borrowing.	1
ClaimBuster	4018	That's how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	4019	There was two or three commission reports, recommendations by the CIA, the State Department, and the others, and the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves.	1
ClaimBuster	4020	And it was so far back, it was considered so odd, and even though we were a tiny, little company at the time, it made all the national magazines.	1
ClaimBuster	4021	The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	4022	The third thing we have to do is we've got to make sure that we're competing in education.	0
ClaimBuster	4023	I know what a hate crime statute pending at the national level is all about in the aftermath of James Byrd's death.	1
ClaimBuster	4024	And a young man is out there on a $1 billion carrier in charge of the maintenance of a $20 million aircraft, working 100 hours a week at times, and he's earning less for himself and his family, while he's away from his family, than he could earn if he were in one of the most menial jobs, working 40 hours a week here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	4025	Anybody else can run the middle class down and run the economy in a ditch.	0
ClaimBuster	4026	You know, nobody likes who shot John, but I think the first negative campaign run in this election was by Governor Clinton, and I'm not going to sit there and be a punching bag; I'm going to stand up and say, hey, listen, here's my side of it.	0
ClaimBuster	4027	It's been a very tough campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	4028	And we need to strengthen the American family.	0
ClaimBuster	4029	And let me say this.	0
ClaimBuster	4030	What are low paying jobs?	0
ClaimBuster	4031	So, I can say there are a great many interests.	0
ClaimBuster	4032	I also want to thank the University of Mississippi for hosting us tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	4033	I see a day in the United States of America where all of our public schools are considered excellent, world class.	0
ClaimBuster	4034	Now, I'm going to reverse that.	0
ClaimBuster	4035	The president's policies have been exercised over the last four years and they haven't put Americans back to work.	1
ClaimBuster	4036	He even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he -- you know, he wasn't sure whether they were aligned with us.	1
ClaimBuster	4037	In my opinion they're going to be de- be greater.	0
ClaimBuster	4038	And a lot of them, as you say, Candy, have been out of work for a long, long, long time.	0
ClaimBuster	4039	Well, 88 percent of the people -- the President claims 11 million are already covered and only 5 percent -- keep in mind only 5 percent of the employers are affected by the Family Leave Act.	1
ClaimBuster	4040	Number two, we've got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years.	1
ClaimBuster	4041	does, which is bulk purchase drugs so that you can lower the price and get them out to you lower.	0
ClaimBuster	4042	And by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	4043	I think our relationships with China are important and I don't want to isolate China, but I think it is a mistake for us to do what this Administration did when all those kids went out there carrying the Statue of Liberty in Tiananmen Square.	0
ClaimBuster	4044	The fact is that there have been markets shut to us that we haven't stood up and fought for.	1
ClaimBuster	4045	It was a nation building mission, and it was not very successful.	1
ClaimBuster	4046	Well, I'm really encouraged to know of your renewed friendship with Al D'Amato, and I know he appreciates it.	0
ClaimBuster	4047	-- me, or your own eyes?''	0
ClaimBuster	4048	I'm lowering taxes actually, because I think it's so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving -- massive corporations and little ones, little ones can't form.	1
ClaimBuster	4049	Unfortunately, they left the money behind for No Child Left Behind.	0
ClaimBuster	4050	We have to move into those areas with programs so that we make adequate use of the resources of those areas.	0
ClaimBuster	4051	I'd like to be that leader with your support.	0
ClaimBuster	4052	I do not favor abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	4053	Senator Obama wants government to do the job.	0
ClaimBuster	4054	So I ask you to look at that.	0
ClaimBuster	4055	Well, it's the civil rights issue of the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	4056	And a senator from Connecticut stood up to him named Prescott Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	4057	That's another reason to get the deficit down.	0
ClaimBuster	4058	I deal with them all the time.	1
ClaimBuster	4059	I thought that was a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	4060	Well, on campaign reform itself, we're going to get it when we have a bipartisan commission, take it out of politics.	0
ClaimBuster	4061	It comes out of a general fund, but something should be done about it.	1
ClaimBuster	4062	And I am disappointed that Secretary Paulson and others have not made that their first priority.	0
ClaimBuster	4063	Mr. Movers, President Carter was not right a few weeks ago when he said that the American people were confronted with only two choices, with only two men, and with only two parties.	0
ClaimBuster	4064	And that's why it's so critical, that we make America once again the most attractive place in the world to start businesses, to build jobs, to grow the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	4065	The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level.	1
ClaimBuster	4066	And I said, well, how does it stop being disruptive?	0
ClaimBuster	4067	Two points I think are important to think about when it comes to Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	4068	We've got people watching tonight and listening tonight trying to find the truth.	0
ClaimBuster	4069	"So, for example, on wind energy, when Governor Romney says ""these are imaginary jobs."""	0
ClaimBuster	4070	And now I suggest that maybe you go to some of these organizations that are the watchdogs of what we do, like the Citizens Against Government Waste or the National Taxpayers Union or these other organizations that watch us all the time.	1
ClaimBuster	4071	As to the drug itself, I mentioned I was disappointed.	0
ClaimBuster	4072	I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work.	0
ClaimBuster	4073	And I've been given a lot -- a lot of credit for it.	1
ClaimBuster	4074	The George Bush who was the charter member of the environmental wrecking crew that went to Washington in the early '80s and did a job on the EPA, or the one we've been seeing and listening to the past two or three months.	1
ClaimBuster	4075	I hope as president that I've earned your trust.	0
ClaimBuster	4076	And I know that we did give back authority and autonomy to the people.	0
ClaimBuster	4077	We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in Medicare and Medicaid... 	0
ClaimBuster	4078	And that is something that I would welcome.	0
ClaimBuster	4079	There is a huge difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	4080	He can buy insurance cheaper than Mom and Pop's store on the corner.	1
ClaimBuster	4081	I happen to support that.	1
ClaimBuster	4082	And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going.	0
ClaimBuster	4083	And we can do it.	0
ClaimBuster	4084	Japan will be hosting a summit.	1
ClaimBuster	4085	And those principles include human rights, human dignity, free enterprise, freedom of expression, elections.	1
ClaimBuster	4086	I understand the importance of time but see, here's how we get to this mess we're in.	0
ClaimBuster	4087	I believe, when an international body speaks, it must mean what it says.	0
ClaimBuster	4088	And I beat back the Congress on that, and then we passed a decent civil rights bill that offers guarantees against discrimination in employment.	1
ClaimBuster	4089	I like those ratings systems.	0
ClaimBuster	4090	Because the president cut in half the number of licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands, and in federal waters.	1
ClaimBuster	4091	The proof of that is we've gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps.	1
ClaimBuster	4092	Now there's a record: Ten and a half million more jobs, rising incomes, falling crime rates and welfare rolls, a strong America at peace.	1
ClaimBuster	4093	That is my position on SDI and it's never wavered a bit.	1
ClaimBuster	4094	I want people all over the world to look to the United States again, to feel that we're on the move, to feel that our high noon is in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	4095	They're using text books that are 10 years old.	1
ClaimBuster	4096	Yes, I want to reduce our deficit by cutting spending that we don't need but also by asking the wealthy to do a little bit more so that we can invest in things like research and technology that are the key to a 21st century economy.	0
ClaimBuster	4097	He also reads all kinds of things into my tax plan and into my Medicare plan.	0
ClaimBuster	4098	And I think that those men and women in those agencies are doing a great job.	0
ClaimBuster	4099	But we've got to get help from the Congress in order to do this.	0
ClaimBuster	4100	I think we've got to have fiscal restraint.	0
ClaimBuster	4101	They were told: Don't even bother; we're not going to listen to it.	0
ClaimBuster	4102	One of the major errors they made was the one that led to the Korean War.	1
ClaimBuster	4103	They need to be tightened.	0
ClaimBuster	4104	Why did the President feel this was wrong and why was the President right and his critics wrong?	0
ClaimBuster	4105	The President just said that his government is shrinking.	1
ClaimBuster	4106	And you have to do that by beginning to not back off of the Fallujahs and other places, and send the wrong message to the terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	4107	And also the private sector ought to be encouraged to - to bring forward to the public the benefits from efficiency.	0
ClaimBuster	4108	And back then, we intercepted a suitcase in a Middle Eastern country with nuclear materials in it.	1
ClaimBuster	4109	And I think that we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way that allows us to get some additional oil.	0
ClaimBuster	4110	And it's named after this amazing woman who had been doing the same job as a man for years, found out that she was getting paid less, and the Supreme Court said that she couldn't bring suit because she should have found about it earlier, whereas she had no way of finding out about it.	1
ClaimBuster	4111	Because China has an interest in the outcome, too.	0
ClaimBuster	4112	A President must know these things.	0
ClaimBuster	4113	Mr. Carter, I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families.	0
ClaimBuster	4114	Like it or not, we are now -- the United States is now the natural leader of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	4115	And I remember you gave a very good answer to New Hampshire about the White Mountains, about how it was important to keep that collaborative effort in place.	1
ClaimBuster	4116	Absolutely, because that was a fight that needed to be had.	0
ClaimBuster	4117	This is a Main Street tax cut, 15 percent across -- let's take a family making $30,000 a year, that's $1261.	1
ClaimBuster	4118	It was ignored in that case and it was a very very serious mistake in judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	4119	Because we're able to draw on the wisdom and experience from different parts of the society that hadn't been tapped in the same way before.	0
ClaimBuster	4120	I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less.	1
ClaimBuster	4121	We invented the auto industry and the fact that we have fallen so far behind is something that we have to work on.	1
ClaimBuster	4122	They used those weapons against -- against their own citizens and killed Americans with them.	1
ClaimBuster	4123	Charlie, thank you, and thank our panelists.	0
ClaimBuster	4124	And that's what we ought to do for all people in America.	0
ClaimBuster	4125	Similarly, in Central America: What we're doing in Nicaragua with this covert war -- which the Congress, including many Republicans, have tried to stop -- is finally end up with a public definition of American power that hurts us, where we get associated with political assassins and the rest.	0
ClaimBuster	4126	The thing that I am in this race for is to tap the American people on the shoulder and to say to every single one of you, fix it while we're still relatively strong.	0
ClaimBuster	4127	And it wasn't until former Secretary of State Jim Baker and General Scowcroft and others pushed publicly and said you've got to go to the U.N., that the president finally changed his mind -- his campaign has a word for that -- and went to the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	4128	We saw the same thing in Lebanon, where we spent a good deal of America's assets.	1
ClaimBuster	4129	I think that's been proven.	1
ClaimBuster	4130	Thank you very much, Chris.	0
ClaimBuster	4131	Under Governor Bush's plan, they would get not one penny for four to five years and then they would be forced to go into an HMO or to an insurance company and ask them for coverage, but there would be no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the terms and conditions.	1
ClaimBuster	4132	What I've said is I won't put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	4133	He went over to say we must make the very changes they're making now.	0
ClaimBuster	4134	Now, my opponent says he's going to try to change the dynamics on the ground.	1
ClaimBuster	4135	The bad news is we lost.	0
ClaimBuster	4136	Between the World Trade Center bombing in, what was it, 1993 or so, and the next time was five years, seven years.	1
ClaimBuster	4137	"So I think even he has learned that you can't say ""read my lips"" because you can't know what emergencies might come up."	0
ClaimBuster	4138	If we tried everything else, if we have allies.	0
ClaimBuster	4139	I want this nation to protect its air, its water, its land, and its public health.	0
ClaimBuster	4140	He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war.	1
ClaimBuster	4141	Ross gave a good answer but I've got to respond directly to Mr. Bush.	0
ClaimBuster	4142	I don't favor equal results, but I do favor making sure everybody has a chance to prove they're competent.	0
ClaimBuster	4143	You know, we have to be right 100 percent of the time.	0
ClaimBuster	4144	And she was forced to apologize.	1
ClaimBuster	4145	Barbara, you've asked that question twice.	1
ClaimBuster	4146	I don't ever want to see another generation of young Americans bleed their lives into sandy beachheads in the Pacific, or rice paddies and jungles in the in Asia or the muddy battlefields of Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	4147	If we cut the capital gains rate, I'm told everyday, I had a letter from a former constituent in Kansas saying I want to sell property in California, put it in my business in Kansas, I can't, because the capital gains rate's too high.	1
ClaimBuster	4148	Now remember, Social Security revenue exceeds expenses up until 2015.	1
ClaimBuster	4149	We are spending now 37 percent more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980.	1
ClaimBuster	4150	I don't think this nation is composed of people who care only for themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	4151	So I get the last question -- last answer --	0
ClaimBuster	4152	Step one, the American people send me up there, the day after election, I'll get with congressional--we won't even wait till inauguration, and I'll ask the president to help me and I'll ask his staff to help me.	0
ClaimBuster	4153	I disagree with the tax-and-spend philosophy.	0
ClaimBuster	4154	We are cutting off the significant items that the Cuban regime needs in order to survive.	0
ClaimBuster	4155	You need about, according to Congressional committees on this, you need about $10 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	4156	It's as good as any private school in the country.	0
ClaimBuster	4157	You have to close the borders.	0
ClaimBuster	4158	Nuclear power: There were 36 power plants planned in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	4159	We need a good strong economic package, let the private sector creates the jobs and they can do it.	0
ClaimBuster	4160	Uh - I remember when uh - Herbert Hoover was against uh - jobs for people.	1
ClaimBuster	4161	But it seems to me the president shouldn't have any comment at all.	0
ClaimBuster	4162	Where possible, I want to give power back to the states and back to the people.	0
ClaimBuster	4163	We ought to cut the growth to twice the rate of inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	4164	We're on the hunt after Osama bin Laden.	1
ClaimBuster	4165	Why haven't they done it in seven years?	0
ClaimBuster	4166	We're not going to rest and not going to be happy until every person in this country who wants a job can have one, until the recovery is complete across the country.	0
ClaimBuster	4167	And I don't believe -- I believe, I should say, as Lincoln once said, that I could not -- I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others.	0
ClaimBuster	4168	I think that, with respect to housing, when we are consuming, even though our per capita income today is about the same as that of the Federal Republic of Germany, we are consuming about, by a factor of two, the amount of energy that they consume in that country.	1
ClaimBuster	4169	The three men who murdered James Byrd, guess what's going to happen to them?	0
ClaimBuster	4170	Let me answer what he just said, about around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	4171	Embryonic stem-cell research requires the destruction of life to create a stem cell.	1
ClaimBuster	4172	Yes, I've got scars to show for being around education reform.	0
ClaimBuster	4173	And while they were coming down, the deficits had started their great increase.	0
ClaimBuster	4174	I want to cut spending.	0
ClaimBuster	4175	My proposal gives $10,000 hiring bonuses for those teachers who are -- who get certified to teach in the areas where they're most needed.	1
ClaimBuster	4176	When we re-engaged -- because, again, the Bush administration reversed course on this -- then we have at least made some progress, although right now, because of the problems in North Korea, we are seeing it on shaky ground.	1
ClaimBuster	4177	No, it's going to totally help you.	0
ClaimBuster	4178	He said Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq as an excuse to spread hatred for America.	1
ClaimBuster	4179	Well, let me just say quickly that I've had an extraordinary experience of watching up close and personal that transition in Russia, because I was there right after the transformation.	1
ClaimBuster	4180	Iran is taking over Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	4181	We are mobilizing humanitarian support, and support for the opposition.	1
ClaimBuster	4182	My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you're willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community.	0
ClaimBuster	4183	Now this does not include uh - any uh - uh extra control over uh unnecessary spending, the weeding out of obsolete or obsolescent programs.	0
ClaimBuster	4184	It's going to help people across the country that are unemployed right now.	0
ClaimBuster	4185	There are some very fundamental differences in this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	4186	We can't have the industries of tomorrow unless we have the best educated workforce.	0
ClaimBuster	4187	And right now, they're in 32 countries.	1
ClaimBuster	4188	You say, how can I get Congress to do that?	0
ClaimBuster	4189	But it's going to take a president who's committed to housing, who's had experience in building and rehabilitating housing who understands that affordable housing for families of low and moderate income, for young families, first time home buyers, is an essential part of the American dream.	0
ClaimBuster	4190	We had a recession in fifty-eight.	1
ClaimBuster	4191	And hopefully tonight when we conclude this debate you will have a better understanding and the viewing and listening audience will have a better understanding.	0
ClaimBuster	4192	And, finally, Medicaid to states?	0
ClaimBuster	4193	They tried it with Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and John Kennedy.	1
ClaimBuster	4194	But if you calculated that unemployment rate, taking back the people who dropped out of the workforce, it would be 10.7 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	4195	I am part of an administration that has the finest record on diversity.	1
ClaimBuster	4196	And why don't we offer incentives for business and industry to start up in those zones?	0
ClaimBuster	4197	Sure, absolutely, so long as they're based upon science and they're reasonable.	0
ClaimBuster	4198	How about the growth of the economy?	0
ClaimBuster	4199	And the next president has to make sure that the next Treasury secretary is thinking about how to strengthen you as a home buyer, you as a homeowner, and not simply think about bailing out banks on Wall Street.	0
ClaimBuster	4200	It calls for more of the same.	0
ClaimBuster	4201	I have a plan to have a summit with all of the allies, something this president has not yet achieved, not yet been able to do to bring people to the table.	1
ClaimBuster	4202	And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are.	0
ClaimBuster	4203	It's important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest.	0
ClaimBuster	4204	I've named four supreme court justices in the State of Texas and would ask the people to check out their qualifications, their deliberations.	1
ClaimBuster	4205	Secondly the difference is we need to explore at home.	0
ClaimBuster	4206	If I knew of three new weapons systems that I thought were purely waste and weren't protected by the Congress, they wouldn't be in the budget.	0
ClaimBuster	4207	The first thing we did was to streamline the legal immigration system, to reduce the backlog, make it easier, simpler and cheaper for people who are waiting in line, obeying the law to make sure that they can come here and contribute to our country and that's good for our economic growth.	1
ClaimBuster	4208	So more debt and less jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	4209	Cutting 500,000 kids from after-school programs, cutting 365,000 kids from health care, running up the biggest deficits in American history.	1
ClaimBuster	4210	And here we have a very strong program going forward in the Department of Commerce.	1
ClaimBuster	4211	Because I think you see, I am one who I get kidded by being a little old fashioned on these things, but I do believe in public service.	0
ClaimBuster	4212	We must not build up the hopes of the world and then dash them as was the case in Paris.	0
ClaimBuster	4213	We're now spending 42 percent of our economy on government.	1
ClaimBuster	4214	On July twelfth of this year, we gave full permission for the release of that report.	1
ClaimBuster	4215	The Soviet Union, to our surprise -- and not just mine -- made it plain when we brought this up that they placed, they thought, a greater reliance on the land-based missiles and, therefore, they wanted to take up all three.	1
ClaimBuster	4216	And he rushed the war in Iraq without a plan to win the peace.	1
ClaimBuster	4217	So these are people that push gays off business -- off buildings.	1
ClaimBuster	4218	Now, if you want to go to the core problem that faces everybody in manufacturing in this country, it's that agreement that's about to be put into practice.	0
ClaimBuster	4219	Hey, I'll answer the question.	0
ClaimBuster	4220	I want to talk about your responsibility, and your responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	4221	We're going to protect Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	4222	So you really owe him an apology.	0
ClaimBuster	4223	I'd like to see it expanded in two ways.	0
ClaimBuster	4224	Jim, Jim, this is a big...	0
ClaimBuster	4225	At the rate that the president is currently securing it, it'll take 13 years to get it.	0
ClaimBuster	4226	I offer a new direction.	0
ClaimBuster	4227	It's just a tragedy in a nation so prosperous as ours, that the last four years have been so hard.	0
ClaimBuster	4228	But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true.	1
ClaimBuster	4229	And you knew that if the Russians themselves were trying to obtain some of these territories or push back against Georgia, that that was not a stable situation.	0
ClaimBuster	4230	And if it won't come down, the economy's going to slow down, maybe go into a recession.	0
ClaimBuster	4231	You obviously studied up on -- on my plan.	0
ClaimBuster	4232	He said we cut Pell Grants.	1
ClaimBuster	4233	We washed our hands of Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	4234	I do not want to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	4235	So there's no economist that can say Mitt Romney's tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan.	0
ClaimBuster	4236	The administration, seems like we're having a great love fest tonight, but the administration made the right decision on training Nigerian troops for situations just such as this in Rwanda, and so I thought they made the right decision not to send U.S. troops into Rwanda.	0
ClaimBuster	4237	I really don't have -- haven't picked anybody yet.	0
ClaimBuster	4238	But let me talk about what's really important for the worker you're referring to.	0
ClaimBuster	4239	She used the power of her office to make a lot of money.	1
ClaimBuster	4240	And I also agree that most police officers, of course, are doing a good job and hate this practice also.	0
ClaimBuster	4241	Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money.	1
ClaimBuster	4242	We are going to have to deal with energy because we can't keep on borrowing from the Chinese and sending money to Saudi Arabia.	0
ClaimBuster	4243	We let families save in an IRA, withdraw tax free to pay for the cost of education and it's all paid for.	1
ClaimBuster	4244	I think that's an example of a judge allowing personal opinion to enter into the decision-making process as opposed to a strict interpretation of the Constitution.	0
ClaimBuster	4245	I decided to go there myself.	0
ClaimBuster	4246	I remember being in a high school in my own state as we were organizing something we call the Governor's Alliance Against Drugs, and a young 16 year old girl coming up to me, desperate, addicted, dependent, saying, Governor, I need help.	1
ClaimBuster	4247	I can't go into detail about them here.	0
ClaimBuster	4248	And I'd have taken it out to the country and I'd have had every law enforcement officer in the country visit those congressmen.	1
ClaimBuster	4249	Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever.	1
ClaimBuster	4250	In addition we uh - in the federal government make available to uh - cities about uh - three billion three hundred million dollars in what we call community development.	1
ClaimBuster	4251	Over $60 million at least will go into this campaign to leave the American dream to you and your children, to get this country straightened out, because if anybody owes it to you, I do.	1
ClaimBuster	4252	Under Vice President Gore's plan, he is going to grow the federal government in the largest increase since Lyndon Baines Johnson in 1965.	1
ClaimBuster	4253	If that child were here today, and I was told the same thing, my granddaughter, Noel for example that child could stay alive for ten or fifteen years, or maybe for the rest of her life.	0
ClaimBuster	4254	I know how to make that happen.	0
ClaimBuster	4255	They know what it's like not to have family leave or childcare.	1
ClaimBuster	4256	There is no doubt about it.	0
ClaimBuster	4257	I think you have to have greater oil and gas production, more coal production, more nuclear production, and in addition you have to have energy conservation.	0
ClaimBuster	4258	This -- we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	4259	We've been very successful in both cases.	0
ClaimBuster	4260	"[Laughter and applause] If I still have time, I might add, Mr. Trewhitt, I might add that it was Seneca or it was Cicero, I don't know which, that said, ""If it was not for the elders correcting the mistakes of the young, there would be no state.''"	1
ClaimBuster	4261	Send us some people that will pass the idea.	0
ClaimBuster	4262	Yes, and thousands, maybe millions of Americans were turned off because of the uh - problems that came out of our involvement in Vietnam.	1
ClaimBuster	4263	They live all across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	4264	We spent $3.1 billion for fire and police, $3.1 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	4265	It is essential that we extend freedom, extend it to all the world.	0
ClaimBuster	4266	And it's the largest number ever this year and they'll break the record next year and every year for ten years running.	1
ClaimBuster	4267	The individuals that would then get jobs - give them a break that encourages them to leave the social welfare programs and go to work.	0
ClaimBuster	4268	And spending, I know, can be brought under control because I have fought against excessive spending my entire career.	1
ClaimBuster	4269	He'll claim credit now for crime going down, but it happens because mayors and governors and others have brought crime down.	1
ClaimBuster	4270	But like Nancy Reagan, and so many other people -- you know, I was at a forum with Michael J.	1
ClaimBuster	4271	There is more work to be done.	0
ClaimBuster	4272	There's a difference between preconditions and preparation.	1
ClaimBuster	4273	I still have a couple of minutes left.	1
ClaimBuster	4274	It seemed to me that most of the arguments were partisan, Republican, Democrat, left, right, liberal, conservative.	0
ClaimBuster	4275	If we take the leadership role and build the new technologies, like the new kinds of cars and trucks that Detroit is itching to build, then we can create millions of good new jobs by being first into the market with these new kinds of cars and trucks and other kinds of technologies.	0
ClaimBuster	4276	Well, they've got a point.	0
ClaimBuster	4277	But the best way to protect this homeland is to stay on the offense.	0
ClaimBuster	4278	But it has taken place.	1
ClaimBuster	4279	He's been in some other country.	1
ClaimBuster	4280	And I don't think most Americans could do that.	0
ClaimBuster	4281	But if somebody wanted to be a cardiologist, ten years from now, you'd have to be certain you complied with some of the rules in this extreme medical plan the government was going to take over for all Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	4282	First, after each of my foreign trips I have made recommendations that have been adopted.	1
ClaimBuster	4283	What we're talking about is a combination of a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent.	0
ClaimBuster	4284	I won't put in place magnets for people coming here illegally.	0
ClaimBuster	4285	Here are a couple of differences, though, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	4286	First of all, we all know that in his state of the union message, he told Congress about nuclear materials that didn't exist.	1
ClaimBuster	4287	Now, John Podesta said you have terrible instincts.	1
ClaimBuster	4288	We've been discouraged too long.	0
ClaimBuster	4289	But one of the problems we have in the military is we're in a lot of places around the world.	1
ClaimBuster	4290	Chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with e-mails and so many other things.	0
ClaimBuster	4291	I remember in the period immediately before the Korean War, South Korea was supposed to be indefensible as well.	0
ClaimBuster	4292	You're the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb.	1
ClaimBuster	4293	What are we going to tell our children?	0
ClaimBuster	4294	Our position happened to be at the airport.	1
ClaimBuster	4295	You ought to be glad you quit, Oscar, 30 years.	0
ClaimBuster	4296	I don't believe, like the vice president does, in huge government.	0
ClaimBuster	4297	I didn't hear, John, exactly where he was going to cut and what he was going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	4298	That's why I'm for instant background checks at gun shows, I'm for trigger locks, I think that makes sense.	0
ClaimBuster	4299	It's our vision of America.	0
ClaimBuster	4300	I mean, we can have a debate back and forth about the merits of each other's campaigns.	0
ClaimBuster	4301	I don't want to jump in.	0
ClaimBuster	4302	I keep my word, and you will have a tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	4303	I think our faith tells us, instructs us, about the moral life that we should lead.	0
ClaimBuster	4304	Ladies and gentlemen, it's his tax plan.	0
ClaimBuster	4305	But what he has said is that, even knowing there were no weapons of mass destruction, even knowing there was no imminent threat, even knowing there was no connection with Al Qaida, he would still have done everything the same way.	1
ClaimBuster	4306	The major purpose of an election for president is to choose a leader.	1
ClaimBuster	4307	And the truth is, there is a lot wrong with America.	0
ClaimBuster	4308	Uh Mr. Kraft, uh - I think the record can be put in this uh - in this way, which uh - is the way that I think satisfies most Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	4309	I'd like to just talk about issues, and so --	0
ClaimBuster	4310	We shut the loophole which has American workers actually subsidizing the loss of their own job.	1
ClaimBuster	4311	And our cancer rate is uh - higher than any country in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	4312	And so what I want to do is keep this expansion going.	0
ClaimBuster	4313	Well, tonight we've had a chance to talk a lot about the past.	1
ClaimBuster	4314	And I oppose it, and I'm going to stand up and continue to oppose it.	0
ClaimBuster	4315	If we can reduce our energy consumption, that reduces the amount of petro dollars that they have to make mischief around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	4316	That's what Admiral Mullen said.	1
ClaimBuster	4317	It - my view is the same as his.	0
ClaimBuster	4318	It's the right thing for the consumers.	0
ClaimBuster	4319	We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen per cent over seven years.	1
ClaimBuster	4320	The only two times when an unbalanced budget is warranted would be during a serious recession - and we had that in fifty-eight in an unbalanced budget of twelve billion dollars - or a national emergency where there should be large expenditures for national defense, which we had in World War II and uh - during part of the Korean War.	1
ClaimBuster	4321	I gotta get it in perspective.	0
ClaimBuster	4322	It would have been increase in sectarian violence.	0
ClaimBuster	4323	I think that Joe Biden is qualified in many respects.	0
ClaimBuster	4324	Once we break out -- once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come...	0
ClaimBuster	4325	Wherever possible the -- the benefit of having two parents in the home, and that's not always possible.	0
ClaimBuster	4326	They recruit them, leaving the older, sicker seniors in Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	4327	And the president has a regular opportunity to label them as a currency manipulator, but refuses to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	4328	We have, during his regime, during President Obama's regime, we've doubled our national debt.	1
ClaimBuster	4329	In analyzing the figures we will find that our unemployment exists among the older citizens; it exists also among those who are inadequately trained; that is, those who do not have an adequate opportunity for education.	1
ClaimBuster	4330	Because I support the Second Amendment doesn't mean that I want people who shouldn't have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family.	0
ClaimBuster	4331	And Secretary Acheson made a very famous speech at the Press Club, early in the year that k- Korean War started, indicating in effect that South Korea was beyond the defense zone of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	4332	From the standpoint of MR, KENNEDY: Well let me say that I think that the president operates in a number of different areas.	0
ClaimBuster	4333	If they know that they will be helping to make decisions and won't be excluded from being an involved party to the national purpose.	0
ClaimBuster	4334	I've worked with those leaders the president talks about, I've worked with them for 20 years, for longer than this president.	1
ClaimBuster	4335	In terms of the Third World, I support the Baker plan.	0
ClaimBuster	4336	The other stuff -- all the other stuff I mentioned -- costs much less than that.	1
ClaimBuster	4337	And for Mr. Carter to suggest that I want to do away with the safety laws and with the laws that pertain to clean water and clean air, and so forth.	0
ClaimBuster	4338	Every one of these items that I have mentioned he's been wrong - dead wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	4339	And the only reason the unemployment rate seems a little lower today is because of all the people that have dropped out of the workforce.	1
ClaimBuster	4340	They showed up in Afghanistan when they were there, because they tried to beat us and they didn't.	1
ClaimBuster	4341	But not just jobs, good paying jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	4342	This was a proliferator out of Pakistan that was selling secrets to places like North Korea and Libya.	1
ClaimBuster	4343	And so the question is: Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street?	0
ClaimBuster	4344	As President, I would press for long-term, vigorous economic growth.	0
ClaimBuster	4345	They lost about a million people in the war, the Korean War, the forgotten war.	1
ClaimBuster	4346	You get shot walking to the store.	1
ClaimBuster	4347	That's not the position you took, however.	0
ClaimBuster	4348	They have not only 15,000 nuclear warheads, but they've got enough to make another 40,000, and some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of Al Qaida.	1
ClaimBuster	4349	Because what I have proposed...	0
ClaimBuster	4350	Our competitors don't do that.	1
ClaimBuster	4351	There ought to be a full-time uh - atomic energy specialist, independent of the power company in the control room, full time, twenty-four hours a day, to shut down a plant if an abnormality develops.	0
ClaimBuster	4352	So let me just give you one other thing.	0
ClaimBuster	4353	Someone who can analyze the depths of feeling in our country to set a standard for our people to follow, to inspire our people to reach for greatness, to correct our defects, to answer difficult questions, to bind ourselves together in a spirit of unity.	0
ClaimBuster	4354	They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it.	0
ClaimBuster	4355	We have a great many people, hundreds of thousands of people living on public assistance in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	4356	But it's one of the great tragedies related to violence in our society which has occurred during this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	4357	We're talking about 2 weeks from now you've gotta decide who's gonna be president.	1
ClaimBuster	4358	And I think it's going down.	0
ClaimBuster	4359	The question really is: which candidate and which party can meet the problems that the United States is going to face in the sixties?	0
ClaimBuster	4360	And I want to come back to something I said before.	0
ClaimBuster	4361	Now that we have these surpluses, it's our responsibility to indemnify the farmer during that period that we get rid of the farmer uh - the surpluses.	0
ClaimBuster	4362	I have fought to reduce the earmarks and eliminate them.	1
ClaimBuster	4363	Somewhere out there there's an extraterrestrial that's doing this to us, I guess.	0
ClaimBuster	4364	The CBO said very clearly that if you were to adopt the president's plan, there would be a $2 trillion hole in Social Security, because today's workers pay in to the system for today's retirees.	1
ClaimBuster	4365	But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax.	1
ClaimBuster	4366	"Then he called her ""Miss Housekeeping,"" because she was Latina."	1
ClaimBuster	4367	You know, remember the question, are you better off?	0
ClaimBuster	4368	They also kick me around.	0
ClaimBuster	4369	But I certainly would have consulted with governors and elected officials before I would have acted unilaterally.	0
ClaimBuster	4370	And unless we are holding ourselves accountable day in, day out, not just when there's a crisis for folks who have power and influence and can hire lobbyists, but for the nurse, the teacher, the police officer, who, frankly, at the end of each month, they've got a little financial crisis going on.	0
ClaimBuster	4371	So we've got to do something for them.	0
ClaimBuster	4372	But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue.	1
ClaimBuster	4373	They were pressing it very hard.	1
ClaimBuster	4374	And yet some of our finest presidents, some of our strongest international leaders were governors-Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt.	1
ClaimBuster	4375	Those on Social Security today will have their promise made, but also to give younger workers the option at their choice of being able to manage some of their own money in the private sector to make sure there's a Social Security system around tomorrow.	1
ClaimBuster	4376	So I'm putting in more than -- by the time it's finished, I'll have more than $100 million invested.	1
ClaimBuster	4377	Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people -- he's willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him.	1
ClaimBuster	4378	Those arms could be used to hurt us down the road.	0
ClaimBuster	4379	But this deal that we're doing with BAC and US Air and KLM and Northwest, guess who's on the president's campaign big time: a guy from Northwest.	1
ClaimBuster	4380	You've got a mature workforce.	0
ClaimBuster	4381	"Now as far as his figures are concerned here tonight, he again is engaging in this, what I would call, mirror game of ""here-it-is-and-here-it-isn't."""	0
ClaimBuster	4382	The Ford administration does have a very comprehensive program to help uh - our major metropolitan areas.	0
ClaimBuster	4383	And the key to great schools, great teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	4384	Looking then to this problem of how the United States should move ahead and where the United States is moving, I think it is well that we take the advice of a very famous campaigner: Let's look at the record.	0
ClaimBuster	4385	We need to expand education savings accounts.	0
ClaimBuster	4386	The tensions will be ratcheted up.	0
ClaimBuster	4387	People who fly on airplanes today, the cargo hold is not X-rayed, but the baggage is.	1
ClaimBuster	4388	Why didn't you do it?	0
ClaimBuster	4389	When you come out in 2014, I presume I'm going to be president.	0
ClaimBuster	4390	I don't think it's a question of eliminating.	0
ClaimBuster	4391	Look, I mean, Senator McCain keeps on using this example that suddenly the president would just meet with somebody without doing any preparation, without having low-level talks.	1
ClaimBuster	4392	I said, if we do the things that I've set out and we are successful, we could begin to draw the troops down in six months.	0
ClaimBuster	4393	And we are the US, and we have a responsibility to lead and to guarantee the security.	0
ClaimBuster	4394	There's no doubt that the system needs reform and there are a lot of screwy things that we end up spending money on, and they need to be eliminated.	0
ClaimBuster	4395	And what I think needs to happen in order to encourage the young to become involved is to shoot straight, is to set aside the partisan differences, and set an agenda that will make sense.	0
ClaimBuster	4396	As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens.	0
ClaimBuster	4397	I appreciate wind jobs in Iowa and across our country.	0
ClaimBuster	4398	I don't know why -- I've never understood quite why Mr. Perot was so upset it, because one of the guys he used to have working for him, I believe, had foreign accounts.	1
ClaimBuster	4399	After the United States took the initiative in working with Israel and with Egypt and achieving the Sinai II agreement - and I'm proud to say that not a single Egyptian or Israeli soldier has lost his life since the signing of the Sinai agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	4400	My targeted tax cut is for child-rearing, buying a first-time home, paying for health care costs.	0
ClaimBuster	4401	I think the government can do better.	0
ClaimBuster	4402	I have seen us ignore Africa.	0
ClaimBuster	4403	Well, Mr. Ford acts like he's uh - running for president for the first time.	0
ClaimBuster	4404	And I have been a consistent reformer.	1
ClaimBuster	4405	You know, one of the responsibilities of growing older, it seems to me, is being able to tell people something they may not want to hear just because it's true.	0
ClaimBuster	4406	It wasn't created that is it was created as a whole retirement or supplement to retirement program.	1
ClaimBuster	4407	Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment.	1
ClaimBuster	4408	"Now furthermore, I am not gonna tell you ""read my lips"" on anything because I cannot foresee what emergencies might develop in this country."	0
ClaimBuster	4409	George Bush didn't propose turning Medicare into a voucher.	1
ClaimBuster	4410	It was very clear, the Russian intentions towards Georgia.	0
ClaimBuster	4411	Those are some brief remarks about the failures of this administration.	0
ClaimBuster	4412	It's important to be friends with people when you don't need each other so that when you do there's a strong bond of friendship.	0
ClaimBuster	4413	I saw it done with our -- our wonderful Ronald Reagan, a conservative from California, and the liberal Democrat Tip O'Neill from Massachusetts.	1
ClaimBuster	4414	Senator Dole voted against student loans, against Headstart, against creating the Department of Education.	1
ClaimBuster	4415	He's proposed $2.2 trillion of new spending, and yet the so-called tax on the rich, which is also a tax on many small-business owners in America, raises $600 million by our account -- billion, $800 billion by his account.	1
ClaimBuster	4416	I see a young man that was elected to the Senate twice, to the House of Representatives twice.	1
ClaimBuster	4417	It empowers people, it trusts people, it makes -- and it's a practical way to encourage people to purchase health care insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	4418	A lot of these people in industries can be converted to the industries of tomorrow, and that's where the high-paying jobs are.	0
ClaimBuster	4419	They are providing the kind of competitions that have upgraded both schools -- types of schools.	1
ClaimBuster	4420	It had its flaws, it had its problems, the first time we had looked at the issue of education in America from a nationwide perspective.	0
ClaimBuster	4421	But my plan is a departure from trickle-down economics, just cutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans and getting out of the way.	0
ClaimBuster	4422	I'm asking for your vote, and God bless.	0
ClaimBuster	4423	I also want a bridge to the truth.	0
ClaimBuster	4424	They do stand for something.	0
ClaimBuster	4425	And the enemy only has to be right once to hurt us.	0
ClaimBuster	4426	Now, I wonder if the -- it's been blocked by the opponents in the majority in the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	4427	I wouldn't single out just food.	0
ClaimBuster	4428	I think the press can play a huge roll in making sure that the backgrounds are clearly presented in an objective way.	0
ClaimBuster	4429	But maybe there ought to be more debates.	0
ClaimBuster	4430	"That's the kind of mindset that said, ""Let's keep it at the United Nations and hope things go well."""	0
ClaimBuster	4431	Well, that is not what happens in these cases.	0
ClaimBuster	4432	We need this kind of strength because we're the guardians of the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	4433	I'm so glad that I have the chance to knock that down.	0
ClaimBuster	4434	Bring them back into the mainstream of public life.	0
ClaimBuster	4435	They're on the front lines.	0
ClaimBuster	4436	We've tried to buy success from our enemies, and at the same time we've excluded from the process the normal friendship of our allies.	0
ClaimBuster	4437	But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us.	0
ClaimBuster	4438	But if you're talking about protecting the taxpayer against his friends in the US Congress, go back to what it was like when you had a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	4439	We know what the problems are, my friends, and we know what the fixes are.	0
ClaimBuster	4440	A commitment to continuing step-by-step healthcare reform with the next step helping people who are between jobs to access healthcare and not lose it just because they are out of work for a while.	0
ClaimBuster	4441	And they brought him down.	1
ClaimBuster	4442	Who will dominate Asia in the next five or ten years?	0
ClaimBuster	4443	What Michael says, don't put all these rules on us, just let us teach and hold us accountable for every grade.	0
ClaimBuster	4444	And just this year, Mr. Bush vetoed a tax increase on the wealthy that gave middle class tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	4445	We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.	0
ClaimBuster	4446	We found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	4447	No, I mean, he clarified what he meant.	1
ClaimBuster	4448	All schools, all school districts, students themselves, and required teacher testing, which goes a step farther than Governor Bush has been willing to go.	0
ClaimBuster	4449	This is the worst trade year in American history by far.	1
ClaimBuster	4450	"Well number one on Indochina, Mr. Nixon talked in - before the newspaper editors in the spring of 1954 about putting, and I quote him, ""American boys into Indochina."""	1
ClaimBuster	4451	And, you know, in 2006 seniors are going to get prescription drug coverage for the first time in Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	4452	What we have done is to hold the lid on spending in an effort to reduce the rate of inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	4453	The question is our future.	0
ClaimBuster	4454	We've also stood up to the new threats of terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	4455	We go back to Washington and very difficult to get it through the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	4456	Everybody knows how to fix them.	0
ClaimBuster	4457	I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in.	0
ClaimBuster	4458	In uh - December of uh - 1975 he vetoed the roughly 18 to 20 billion dollar uh tax-reduction bill that had been passed by the Congress, and then he came back later on in January of this year and he did advocate a $10 billion tax reduction, but it would be offset by a $6 billion increase this coming January in deductions for Social Security payments and for unemployment compensation.	1
ClaimBuster	4459	And from those five, I always chose the first one or second one.	1
ClaimBuster	4460	The agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis was signed at the White House and the agreement -- the peace treaty with Jordan, I was -- I went to Jordan to sign that -- to be there.	1
ClaimBuster	4461	"His first statement was, ""Both sides ought to show restraint."""	1
ClaimBuster	4462	If you like that, you'll love Canada and England.	0
ClaimBuster	4463	You need a better community, you know, relation.	0
ClaimBuster	4464	Actually, Mr. Vice President, it's not true.	0
ClaimBuster	4465	Thank you, Arizona State, for welcoming us.	0
ClaimBuster	4466	You asked me a question.	1
ClaimBuster	4467	We have made available to the Israelis over 45 percent of the total economic and military aid since the establishment of Israel twenty-seven years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	4468	I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it.	0
ClaimBuster	4469	I am very oriented toward the future.	0
ClaimBuster	4470	So I believe in flexibility, I believe in a national reading initiative for local districts to access with K through 2 diagnostic testing, curriculum that works, phonics works, by the way, it needs to be a part of our curriculum.	0
ClaimBuster	4471	Jim, I don't think that's a fair shot.	0
ClaimBuster	4472	Nobody is suggesting that we unilaterally disarm or somehow reduce our strength, of course not.	0
ClaimBuster	4473	That makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support.	1
ClaimBuster	4474	We don't think that those people should be allowed to continue operating free.	0
ClaimBuster	4475	We've got to have somebody who is fighting for patients and making sure that you get decent, affordable health care.	0
ClaimBuster	4476	Took it three steps, twice we sent welfare reform to the president and he vetoed it.	1
ClaimBuster	4477	And I went there hoping that, once and for all, the free world would act in concert to get Saddam Hussein to listen to our demands.	0
ClaimBuster	4478	Yeah, but wouldn't that suggest to the American people, then, here's a quality person, if he decided that he could automatically get the nomination of either party?	0
ClaimBuster	4479	It should be a helping hand, and tax relief and the proposals I just described should be a good helping hand.	1
ClaimBuster	4480	It needs to be in our vital interest, the mission needs to be clear, and the extra strategy obvious.	0
ClaimBuster	4481	You can't have a consequence for somebody without fear of getting sued under federal law.	1
ClaimBuster	4482	To do that you need a system of managed competition where all of us are covered in big groups and we can choose our doctors and our hospitals, a wide range, but there is an incentive to control costs.	0
ClaimBuster	4483	Mr. Nixon uh - shows himself i- misinformed.	0
ClaimBuster	4484	This administration may say they have a plan, but the truth is they have not even released all the money, the paltry sum of money, that Congress appropriated.	1
ClaimBuster	4485	Von Fremd, it would be completely irresponsible for a candidate for the presidency, or for a president himself, to indicate the course of action and the weapons he would use in the event of such an attack.	0
ClaimBuster	4486	The laws protect the American taxpayer in this regard.	1
ClaimBuster	4487	And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding.	0
ClaimBuster	4488	So I'm not prepared to threaten it, as Senator Obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan.	1
ClaimBuster	4489	I just don't believe that would stimulate any kind of growth at all.	0
ClaimBuster	4490	I don't think there's any question about that, and I resent it.	0
ClaimBuster	4491	Three times since World War II, the Vice President has had to suddenly become the President and commander in chief.	1
ClaimBuster	4492	And I'd like to thank those of you who are watching.	0
ClaimBuster	4493	I see a man who is young and I am putting my confidence in a whole generation of people that are in their 30Ãâ‚¬s and 40Ãâ‚¬s.	0
ClaimBuster	4494	Uh - another system is where uhh - a dentist can invest money in say, raising cattle and uh - can put in a hundred thousand dollars of his own money, borrow nine hundred thousand dollars - nine hundred mi- thousand dollars - that makes a million - and mark off a great amount of uh - of loss uh - through that procedure.	1
ClaimBuster	4495	Well, let me translate that, if I can, Chris, because...	0
ClaimBuster	4496	In order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from the ground; we have to improve our utilization of coal - make it more efficient, make it cleaner.	0
ClaimBuster	4497	But we also need to look at some options, whether or not we -- depending on what the options are.	0
ClaimBuster	4498	Now, the Governor has also played a little fast and loose with the facts about vetoes.	0
ClaimBuster	4499	And yet think about where we are: Added 1.9 million new jobs over the past 13 months.	1
ClaimBuster	4500	And what he is saying, if I understand him correctly, is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this choice.	0
ClaimBuster	4501	I'm just not going to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	4502	What I have been advocating is, why don't we start with the Federal Government turning back tax sources to states and local governments, as well as the responsibilities for those programs?	0
ClaimBuster	4503	In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed.	1
ClaimBuster	4504	On the other things that you've just said about the terrorists, I'm tempted to ask you what you would do.	0
ClaimBuster	4505	Guinea and Ghana have both moved within the Soviet sphere of influence in foreign policy; so has Cuba.	1
ClaimBuster	4506	And you guys have been having a hard time, and I want to fight for you.	0
ClaimBuster	4507	I'd like to change that.	0
ClaimBuster	4508	Number one, we spend at least $60 billion a year on insurance, administrative cost, bureaucracy, and government regulation that wouldn't be spent in any other nation.	1
ClaimBuster	4509	Term limits for members of the US Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	4510	In 1974, we had the worst recession, the deepest and most penetrating recession since the Second World War.	1
ClaimBuster	4511	It's not government investments that makes businesses grow and hire people.	1
ClaimBuster	4512	It's going to help everything.	0
ClaimBuster	4513	Secondly, I think we have a rich uh - country.	0
ClaimBuster	4514	They've had their chance to deliver a tax cut to you.	0
ClaimBuster	4515	Make an effort to put a ramp up there so someone in a wheelchair can get up.	0
ClaimBuster	4516	But Senator Dole has consistently opposed Federal help to education.	1
ClaimBuster	4517	And we ought to have to limit -- we ought to have a much longer period of time, about 5 years, between the time when people can leave executive branch offices and then go out and start lobbying for foreign interests.	0
ClaimBuster	4518	The president inherited growth of over 5 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	4519	That's not what happens in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	4520	I blame the president for the things the president could do that has an impact on it.	0
ClaimBuster	4521	We have the strongest military, and I'll do whatever is necessary, if I'm president, to make sure that it stays that way.	1
ClaimBuster	4522	Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children's Health Insurance Program.	1
ClaimBuster	4523	"My opponent says help is on the way, but what kind of message does it say to our troops in harm's way, ""wrong war, wrong place, wrong time""?"	1
ClaimBuster	4524	Number two, by stealing our intellectual property; our designs, our patents, our technology.	0
ClaimBuster	4525	So I agree that we have to speak responsibly and we have to act responsibly.	0
ClaimBuster	4526	If you put 50 tons of TNT in each one of railroad cars, you would have a carload of TNT - a trainload of TNT stretching across this nation.	1
ClaimBuster	4527	But I also laid out a very strict series of things we needed to do in order to proceed from a position of strength.	1
ClaimBuster	4528	I would say that a president will be able to lead - a president will be able to get his program through - to the effect that he has the support of the country, the support of the people.	0
ClaimBuster	4529	I remember being in a high school in my own state as we were organizing something we call the Governor's Alliance Against Drugs, and a young 16 year old girl coming up to me, desperate, addicted, dependent, saying, Governor, I need help.	1
ClaimBuster	4530	But second, in addition to that, if we do get into a recessionary period we should move on that part of the economy which is represented by the private sector, and I mean stimulate that part of the economy that can create jobs - the private sector of the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	4531	But it was a surprise to us, because they outnumbered us 64 to 36 in submarines and 20 percent more bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles than we had.	1
ClaimBuster	4532	And today, we have about five hundred Georgians at their own expense - just working people who believe in me - spread around the country uh - involved in the political campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	4533	With our modern technology, yes, we can burn our coal within the limits of the Clean Air Act.	1
ClaimBuster	4534	You're judged by the whole record.	0
ClaimBuster	4535	On any program, and this includes crime, you'll find we have all kinds of great plans lying around that never get enacted into law and implemented.	1
ClaimBuster	4536	A few things that can be done: we have now a deferral system so that the multinational corporations who invest overseas - if they make a million dollars in profits overseas - they don't have to pay any of their taxes unless they bring their money back into this country.	1
ClaimBuster	4537	I think what he should have done is gone before the American people on the front end and said listen, I made a commitment and it was wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	4538	And the result is that you've been bombarded with advertisements suggesting that I've changed a position on this or that or the other.	1
ClaimBuster	4539	Everybody who's looked at it, 500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say it's bad for the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	4540	By the third grade many times children who were in the Head Start program aren't any better off than the others.	1
ClaimBuster	4541	Well, the uh - the assumption that - that you uh - have described as different is in the rate of growth of our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	4542	He's the first president in 72 years to lose jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	4543	Of course, we change tactics when need to, but we never change our beliefs, the strategic beliefs that are necessary to protect this country in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	4544	"So we had a policy called ""Mend it, don't end it."	1
ClaimBuster	4545	And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee.	1
ClaimBuster	4546	And we want to shrink those groups and those networks and we can do that.	0
ClaimBuster	4547	The money goes 100 percent -- 100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military.	1
ClaimBuster	4548	And I don't agree with them.	0
ClaimBuster	4549	We have got to become more concerned about people who play by the rules and get the balance we require.	0
ClaimBuster	4550	Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them.	0
ClaimBuster	4551	It's going to be a hard fight.	0
ClaimBuster	4552	Jason, I appreciate that very much, being a former military man myself.	1
ClaimBuster	4553	We need to think differently about the issue.	0
ClaimBuster	4554	As a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	4555	Yet at the same time, he was very -- we were very unpopular in Europe because of the decisions he made.	1
ClaimBuster	4556	I thought it was in our strategic interests to keep Milosevic in check because of our relations in NATO, and that's why I took the position I took.	0
ClaimBuster	4557	Saddam Hussein was a risk to our country, ma'am.	0
ClaimBuster	4558	As a result of that wonderful experience all over the United States, there is a new spirit in America.	0
ClaimBuster	4559	Government -- he says invest government, grow government.	1
ClaimBuster	4560	We also ought to make it very clear that the Russians are in violation of their cease-fire agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	4561	I mean, this guy, this is too much.	0
ClaimBuster	4562	If I should ever decide in the future to discuss my - my deep Christian beliefs and uh - condemnation and sinfulness, I'll use another forum besides Playboy.	0
ClaimBuster	4563	After he left the senate, we abandoned that.	1
ClaimBuster	4564	We have a strong charter school movement that I signed the legislation to get started in the State of Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	4565	Oh, I just thought about one.	0
ClaimBuster	4566	At his pace, it's going to take 13 years to reduce and get ahold of all the loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	4567	And simple things weren't done.	0
ClaimBuster	4568	If we do those things, then I believe that we can create a better school system.	0
ClaimBuster	4569	We cannot allow Iran to get a nuclear weapon.	0
ClaimBuster	4570	The only way to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore at home.	0
ClaimBuster	4571	And let me tell you, you're absolutely right about part of that, which is I want to bring the rates down, I want to simplify the tax code, and I want to get middle- income taxpayers to have lower taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	4572	That's why it's so important for us to be able to work in concert with our allies.	0
ClaimBuster	4573	As I said, almost 30% of it goes to Americans that make more than $1 million per year.	1
ClaimBuster	4574	I don't think he misled you when he said that, you know, anyone who doubted whether the world was better off without Saddam Hussein in power didn't have the judgment to be president.	0
ClaimBuster	4575	They've got so many loopholes they don't have to pay much in taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	4576	I agree with the governor.	0
ClaimBuster	4577	You take a look at Mosul.	0
ClaimBuster	4578	They left -- fired 1,400 people.	1
ClaimBuster	4579	It's one America, one nation.	0
ClaimBuster	4580	And, in this connection, I think that uh - we must look to the future having in mind the fact that we fight Communism at home not only by our laws to deal with Communists uh - the few who do become Communists and the few who do become tra- fellow travelers, but we also fight Communism at home by moving against those various injustices which exist in our society which the Communists feed upon.	0
ClaimBuster	4581	If the uh - list was, uh - in my opinion, fairly uniform, if there was no outstanding person, then I would undoubtedly choose someone who would most accurately reflect my own basic politi- political philosophy as best I could determine it.	0
ClaimBuster	4582	There's a pattern here of appealing to the auto workers and then trying to appeal to the spotted owl crowds or the extremes in the environmental movement.	0
ClaimBuster	4583	Is it true that this Administration, as Senator Kennedy has charged, has been an Administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation?	0
ClaimBuster	4584	Sometimes we cannot let other countries have a veto on our foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	4585	It is -- our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster.	1
ClaimBuster	4586	Now, the president has presided over an economy where we've lost 1.6 million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	4587	Now let's keep going by finishing the work of putting the police on the street and tackling juvenile gangs.	0
ClaimBuster	4588	I will make them famous.	0
ClaimBuster	4589	So I think that the idea of humility is an important one.	0
ClaimBuster	4590	I know our allies, and I can work much more closely with them.	0
ClaimBuster	4591	I just don't know how the president could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the -- at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	4592	I don't want to try to put our troops in all places at all times.	0
ClaimBuster	4593	In some cases, we are going to have to invest.	0
ClaimBuster	4594	I think this should be indicative of the kind of leaders I would choose to help me if I am elected.	0
ClaimBuster	4595	So I've proposed four specific things that I think can help.	1
ClaimBuster	4596	It's your understanding of the forces of change that are sweeping the world, and whether or not you're in a position to provide leadership to make those forces of change work for us and not against us.	0
ClaimBuster	4597	And we need to win that future.	0
ClaimBuster	4598	"Yes, my rebuttal, once again, is that this invention that has just been created here of how I would go about rolling over for the Soviet Union -- no, Mr. Mondale, my idea would be with that defensive weapon that we would sit down with them and then say, ""Now, are you willing to join us?"	0
ClaimBuster	4599	And we support the U.N. efforts there.	1
ClaimBuster	4600	You can ship jobs overseas and get tax breaks for it.	1
ClaimBuster	4601	Those words really have to mean something.	0
ClaimBuster	4602	I want to correct, the all these things I voted against, they were probably part of some big package that had a lot of pork in it or a lot of things that we shouldn't have had and we probably voted no.	1
ClaimBuster	4603	That's why I support instant background checks at gun shows.	1
ClaimBuster	4604	And the insurance companies say it won't work and they won't offer these plans.	1
ClaimBuster	4605	And that's why it is essential we not leave.	0
ClaimBuster	4606	And the governor may not want to answer that question, he may want to call it a high school debating trick, but let me tell you this.	0
ClaimBuster	4607	Let's get him working on Syria, their client state, and see if we can't get them to join Israel and other Arab nations, if at all possible, and Arab leaders, in finally bringing peace to that troubled region.	0
ClaimBuster	4608	Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt.	1
ClaimBuster	4609	We don't have a comprehensive understandable foreign policy that deals with world problems or even regional problems.	1
ClaimBuster	4610	The big drug companies support Governor Bush's prescription drug proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	4611	And the world is better off without him in power.	0
ClaimBuster	4612	Well, but he gets the first word of that segment.	0
ClaimBuster	4613	We, in addition, see that uh - in the last uh - four years the number of employees hired by the Congress has gone up substantial- uh much more than uh - the gross national product, much more than any other increase throughout our society.	1
ClaimBuster	4614	It was a bipartisan commission, a study by two respected economists, which indicated that we could collect some 40, 45, 50 billion dollars of those funds.	1
ClaimBuster	4615	Now this may seem like a rigid, inflexible position.	0
ClaimBuster	4616	Iran is one of their biggest trading partners.	1
ClaimBuster	4617	New York -- New York has done an excellent job.	0
ClaimBuster	4618	There is a lot of evidence about the very good work...	0
ClaimBuster	4619	Lock your wallet because he's coming right after you just like Jimmy Carter did and just like you're going to get -- you're going to end up with interest rates at 21%, and you're going to have inflation going through the roof.	1
ClaimBuster	4620	But there's no doubt that we have to continue building up readiness and military strength.	0
ClaimBuster	4621	That ammo is now being used against our kids.	0
ClaimBuster	4622	Well yes, I question the figure about the decline in defense spending under the two previous Administrations in the preceding eight years to this Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	4623	If you've been on television about it, you think you did it.	0
ClaimBuster	4624	And that's what I've done administratively.	0
ClaimBuster	4625	The mayor of New York, Mayor Bloomberg, just imposed an across- the-board spending freeze on New York City.	1
ClaimBuster	4626	say, he is our hero.	0
ClaimBuster	4627	Mr. Nixon misstates my figures constantly, which uh - is of course his right, but the fact of the matter is: here is where I stand and I just want to have it on the public record.	0
ClaimBuster	4628	people get so tired of politics.	0
ClaimBuster	4629	It's all about the Constitution of -- of -- and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be.	0
ClaimBuster	4630	It's the kind of priority that will be at the top of our list beginning in January of 1989.	0
ClaimBuster	4631	And I would hope to never have to use force.	0
ClaimBuster	4632	They are often on the front line of catastrophic situations.	0
ClaimBuster	4633	He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful.	1
ClaimBuster	4634	We shouldn't be dwelling on the past, or even the present.	0
ClaimBuster	4635	It says if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got a complaint with your insurance company, you can take your complaint to an objective body.	1
ClaimBuster	4636	I had a person in the Oval Office who lost a child in a school bus accident where a drunk driver caused the accident directly, but there were problems with the school bus.	1
ClaimBuster	4637	There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money.	1
ClaimBuster	4638	We'll stay on the hunt on Al Qaida.	0
ClaimBuster	4639	Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing.	1
ClaimBuster	4640	We ought to help protect our kids from drugs and guns and gangs and tobacco.	0
ClaimBuster	4641	If you don't get a two-thirds, then your resolution doesn't pass.	1
ClaimBuster	4642	I'm saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs, and I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention.	0
ClaimBuster	4643	My position has always been that the job of the United States was to minimize the risks of peace.	0
ClaimBuster	4644	That made no sense whatsoever.	0
ClaimBuster	4645	We don't want him fishing in troubled waters in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	4646	Take a look at Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	4647	It means that the teacher that I met in Las Vegas, a wonderful young lady, who describes to me -- she's got 42 kids in her class.	1
ClaimBuster	4648	Because a couple of times the governor has said that I am for a bigger government.	1
ClaimBuster	4649	Had gone to school here, pledged allegiance to the flag.	0
ClaimBuster	4650	But I believe that my plan might offer an opportunity for that, if we would move into those areas and let, encourage - with the tax incentive - the private sector, to develop and to create the jobs for the people.	0
ClaimBuster	4651	I think that judgment could be made after election, if I'm successful.	0
ClaimBuster	4652	This is the end of the beginning, if we come out with a package that will keep these institutions stable.	0
ClaimBuster	4653	I'm going to have a special prosecutor.	0
ClaimBuster	4654	And so, again, look at the record, particularly the energy bill.	0
ClaimBuster	4655	I obviously repudiate the Klan; I repudiate anybody who uses the religious issue; I will not tolerate it, I have ordered all of my people to have nothing to do with it and I say - say to this great audience, whoever may be listening, remember, if you believe in America, if you want America to set the right example to the world, that we cannot have religious or racial prejudice.	0
ClaimBuster	4656	If they can't make payroll, then they may end up having to shut their doors and lay people off.	0
ClaimBuster	4657	You - Mr. Truman came to office in nineteen uh - forty-four and at the end of the war, and uh - difficulties that were facing the United States during that period of transition - 1946 when price controls were lifted - so it's rather difficult to use an overall figure taking those seven and a half years and comparing them to the last eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	4658	We've raised about $10 million.	1
ClaimBuster	4659	Candy, there are some jobs that are not going to come back.	0
ClaimBuster	4660	You may not be one of them, you're just not one of the right people.	0
ClaimBuster	4661	I expect to have the opportunity to do so myself.	0
ClaimBuster	4662	But you're investing in companies doesn't do that.	0
ClaimBuster	4663	The problem with a spending freeze is you're using a hatchet where you need a scalpel.	0
ClaimBuster	4664	As a matter fact, in - sin- since the late sixties when Mr. Nixon took office, we've had a reduction in uh - in the percentage of taxes paid by corporations from 30 percent down to about 20 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	4665	I am convinced that, until we reverse this continued decline in home ownership and put a floor under it, and so that people have not only the hope and belief they can stay in their homes and realize the American dream, but that value will come up.	0
ClaimBuster	4666	I think we need to get serious about this energy crisis, both in the Congress and in the White House, and if you entrust me with the presidency, I will tackle this problem and focus on new technologies that will make us less dependent on big oil or foreign oil.	0
ClaimBuster	4667	I have brought into the top level, top levels of government, into the White House, into administrative offices of the Executive branch, into the judicial system, highly qualified black and Spanish citizens and women who in the past had been excluded.	1
ClaimBuster	4668	I want bilateral talks which put all of the issues, from the armistice of 1952, the economic issues, the human rights issues, the artillery disposal issues, the DMZ issues and the nuclear issues on the table.	0
ClaimBuster	4669	But as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don't know Putin.	1
ClaimBuster	4670	The uh - description just made of this administration's record is hard to uh - recognize.	0
ClaimBuster	4671	What I would not have had done was left 10,000 troops in Iraq that would tie us down.	1
ClaimBuster	4672	Let's talk about corporate taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	4673	We should give a tax cut, targeted to child rearing and education, to buying a first home and paying for health care.	0
ClaimBuster	4674	You're going to get a repeat of the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	4675	On day one, I will label China a currency manipulator, which will allow me as president to be able to put in place, if necessary, tariffs where I believe that they are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers.	0
ClaimBuster	4676	I mean, what do you need, a signed document?	0
ClaimBuster	4677	The president's terms are limited to 2, a total of 8 years.	1
ClaimBuster	4678	He gets to decide what he wants to talk about.	0
ClaimBuster	4679	And -- and so the strength that we have shown in Iran is shown by the fact that we've been able to mobilize the world.	0
ClaimBuster	4680	They have no idea where they come from.	1
ClaimBuster	4681	Yes, I would like to add my words of thanks, too, to the ladies of the League of Women Voters for making these debates possible.	0
ClaimBuster	4682	When they tried to reduce taxes, he voted against that 127 times.	1
ClaimBuster	4683	One is to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	4684	You were very much involved in every aspect of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	4685	I think the record shows otherwise.	0
ClaimBuster	4686	Governor, we have actually produced more oil --	1
ClaimBuster	4687	The administration says they support the instant check.	1
ClaimBuster	4688	And so I'm very proud of the way that came about and I think it's a very, very good beginning.	0
ClaimBuster	4689	I think that's the essence of leadership, rather than cutting deals in dark rooms in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	4690	But then of course we had a Democratic Congress and they didn't want to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	4691	And that is just absolutely unfair to the vast majority of Americans who pay their taxes and pay them on time.	0
ClaimBuster	4692	We went in to Somalia as a peacemaking organization, we ended up trying to be -- excuse me, as a peacekeeping organization, we ended up trying to be peacemakers and we ended up having to withdraw in humiliation.	1
ClaimBuster	4693	This, I believe, has assured that our interests will be protected in the Persian Gulf region, as we have done in the Middle East and throughout the world.	0
ClaimBuster	4694	And when we talk about deficits, if we're adding to our deficit for tax cuts for folks who don't need them, and we're cutting investments in research and science that will create the next Apple, create the next new innovation that will sell products around the world, we will lose that race.	0
ClaimBuster	4695	Everybody got tax relief, so that they get out of the recession.	1
ClaimBuster	4696	Now, I have thought for a long time that too many of our churches have been too reluctant to speak up in behalf of what they believe is proper in Government, and they have been too too lax in interfering, in recent years, with Government's invasion of the family itself, putting itself between parent and child.	0
ClaimBuster	4697	I'm not looking to cut taxes for wealthy people.	0
ClaimBuster	4698	I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China.	0
ClaimBuster	4699	She gets a small pension, but in order to pay for her prescription drug benefits, she has to go out seven days a week several hours a day picking up cans.	1
ClaimBuster	4700	"You know, I saw a movie - ""Crocodile Dundee."""	1
ClaimBuster	4701	And we are bleeding arterially.	0
ClaimBuster	4702	It's what are our capabilities.	0
ClaimBuster	4703	And I never made that statement; never would.	1
ClaimBuster	4704	Senator Bentsen said, as you recall at the debate with Senator Quayle, that if you give any of us $200 billion worth of hot checks a year, we can create an illusion of prosperity.	1
ClaimBuster	4705	Well, I'm just quoting you when you were asked...	0
ClaimBuster	4706	And the strains that have been placed on our alliances around the world and the respect that's been diminished over the last eight years has constrained us being able to act on something like the genocide in Darfur, because we don't have the resources or the allies to do everything that we should be doing.	1
ClaimBuster	4707	I can't take anything off the table.	0
ClaimBuster	4708	I use that term with all respect, by the way.	0
ClaimBuster	4709	The - the check on the quality of health care is in a different one.	0
ClaimBuster	4710	Our relationship with Israel, my relationship with the prime minister of Israel is such that we would not get a call saying our bombers are on the way, or their fighters are on the way.	0
ClaimBuster	4711	Well, I'm not gonna name my cabinet before I get elected.	0
ClaimBuster	4712	It's not going to be all done by legislation.	0
ClaimBuster	4713	But I can counsel people.	1
ClaimBuster	4714	You ain't seen nothing yet.	0
ClaimBuster	4715	All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much.	0
ClaimBuster	4716	Because you are so interested in a poll that might have been coming out, or because somebody had said something nasty about somebody else.	0
ClaimBuster	4717	I believe that Governor Carter doesn't realize the need and necessity for arms sales to Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	4718	First of all, I don't think he can succeed in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	4719	And we have a duty to our country and to future generations of America to achieve a free Iraq, a free Afghanistan, and to rid the world of weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	4720	Look, I love to -- I love teachers, and I'm happy to have states and communities that want to hire teachers do that.	0
ClaimBuster	4721	So all of these things need to be examined, of course.	0
ClaimBuster	4722	Let's see how they do.	0
ClaimBuster	4723	He more than doubled state spending while he was Governor - 122% increase - and had between a 20% and 30% increase in the number of employees	1
ClaimBuster	4724	We have to stand for our principles, stand for our allies, stand for a strong military and stand for a stronger economy.	0
ClaimBuster	4725	I think that we're showing the proper compassion and concern.	0
ClaimBuster	4726	But I want to -- on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good.	0
ClaimBuster	4727	But tell her it's not all that gloomy; we're the US, we faced tough problems before.	0
ClaimBuster	4728	I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that's, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve.	0
ClaimBuster	4729	Next year they're going to go up over 100 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	4730	But that having been said, I believe that -- well, first of all, let me say that the governor and I agree on some things where this subject is concerned.	0
ClaimBuster	4731	Anybody who says America's been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling around America.	0
ClaimBuster	4732	But it takes more than that.	0
ClaimBuster	4733	I don't want to rip families apart.	0
ClaimBuster	4734	You can't disallow someone the right to visit their partner in a hospital.	0
ClaimBuster	4735	You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better.	0
ClaimBuster	4736	But I also believe that when he said behind closed doors that 47 percent of the country considered themselves victims who refuse personal responsibility, think about who he was talking about.	1
ClaimBuster	4737	Where we're not making the progress, Sander, is in -- we're making it in teenagers, and thank God, because I thought what Ross said was most appropriate about these families and these children.	0
ClaimBuster	4738	And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries.	1
ClaimBuster	4739	And I think, my gosh, wouldn't it be wonderful if every child had that love and support.	0
ClaimBuster	4740	The vice president keeps saying I'm against things.	1
ClaimBuster	4741	We need to concentrate our research and development effort on uh coal burning and extraction, with safer mines, but also it's clean burning.	0
ClaimBuster	4742	I have clear eyes on this.	0
ClaimBuster	4743	They stand for a whole different approach to the problems facing this country at home and abroad.	0
ClaimBuster	4744	She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o'clock in the morning?	1
ClaimBuster	4745	The problem is, you talk, but you don't get anything done, Hillary.	0
ClaimBuster	4746	That's what a leader does.	0
ClaimBuster	4747	And what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about what's most pressing to them: the economic crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	4748	It's very unlike World War II, when FDR's sons flew missions.	1
ClaimBuster	4749	Twelve percent of our gross national product goes to health care.	1
ClaimBuster	4750	We're the envy of the world in terms of our economy, despite the difficulties we're having.	0
ClaimBuster	4751	... with the Russians and other foreign powers.	0
ClaimBuster	4752	Not to the schools but to -- you know, 46% of the teachers in Chicago, public school teachers, send their kids to private school.	1
ClaimBuster	4753	Karl Marx was the grandfather of Communism.	1
ClaimBuster	4754	NATO, for example, has kept the peace for many, many years, and I want to see us keep fully staffed in NATO so we'll continue to guarantee the peace in Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	4755	But the President that I quoted had made a promise, a Democratic promise, and I quoted him because it was never kept.	0
ClaimBuster	4756	And that is the continued discussion and claim that somehow I am the villain who is going to pull the Social Security checks out from those people who are dependent on them.	0
ClaimBuster	4757	And I'm, you know -- there would be special rights for different groups in America.	0
ClaimBuster	4758	And if we're strong in each of those things, American influence will grow.	0
ClaimBuster	4759	I didn't say we had the worst education in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	4760	What was he referring to?	0
ClaimBuster	4761	Fewer water complaints since I've been the president.	1
ClaimBuster	4762	We're the reform party, and we're going to make things better, and one of the things we're going to do is stop exporting jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	4763	This was an attack by terrorists.	1
ClaimBuster	4764	We have had for many years, understandably, a system of restraints on high technology because the Soviets are behind us.	0
ClaimBuster	4765	I don't think the surplus is the government's money.	0
ClaimBuster	4766	Mr. President, the voluntary thing that I suggested many years ago was that with a young man orphaned and raised by an aunt who died, his aunt was ineligible for Social Security insurance because she was not his mother.	1
ClaimBuster	4767	But I don't see where it is inflationary to have people keep more of their earnings and spend it, and it isn't inflationary for government to take that money away from them and spend it on the things it wants to spend it on.	0
ClaimBuster	4768	We'll spend $25 trillion -- we'll collect $25 trillion in revenue in the next 10 years and spend $21 trillion.	0
ClaimBuster	4769	They feel as if they had finally an administration who was going to take this issue seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	4770	Do they want to follow United States leadership?	0
ClaimBuster	4771	And it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren.	0
ClaimBuster	4772	On that question the Vice President and I disagreed.	1
ClaimBuster	4773	My friends, some of this $700 billion ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.	1
ClaimBuster	4774	We're going to make sure that insurance companies can't discriminate on the basis of pre-existing conditions.	0
ClaimBuster	4775	And that -- don't take my word for it, take the executives at GM and Chrysler, some of whom are Republicans, may even support Governor Romney.	1
ClaimBuster	4776	He can have another ten seconds if he wants, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	4777	Ours is a big state, a fast-growing state.	1
ClaimBuster	4778	Then you didn't read it.	0
ClaimBuster	4779	There, Mr. Khrushchev came to that conference determined to break it up.	1
ClaimBuster	4780	No, because I'm pledged to that, and yes, some taxes have gone up.	1
ClaimBuster	4781	Only the last few days with the election approaching, has Mr. Ford taken any interest in a nonproliferation movement.	0
ClaimBuster	4782	And, absolutely, we need earmark reform.	0
ClaimBuster	4783	"Maybe an 18th resolution would work,"" he would have been stronger and tougher, and the world would have been a lot worse off."	0
ClaimBuster	4784	These islands are a few miles - five or six miles - off the coast of Red China, within a general harbor area and more than a hundred miles from Formosa.	1
ClaimBuster	4785	But the key that we're going to have to pursue is a -- is a pathway to get the Muslim world to be able to reject extremism on its own.	0
ClaimBuster	4786	I was against the war.	1
ClaimBuster	4787	In many cases they are people in the community who are examples, and are role models.	0
ClaimBuster	4788	And there are a bunch of things we can do to make sure your future is bright.	0
ClaimBuster	4789	There is no litmus test on any issue.	0
ClaimBuster	4790	And yet, interestingly enough, we have the most religious freedom of any country in the world, including the freedom not to believe.	1
ClaimBuster	4791	The American people are bright, intelligent, caring, loving people who want a great country for their children and grandchildren.	0
ClaimBuster	4792	I agree with Mr. Bush that values are important.	0
ClaimBuster	4793	And that's what I want to talk about.	0
ClaimBuster	4794	But have no doubt, but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	4795	But we've also got to continue to figure out how we have efficiency energy, because ultimately that's how we're going to reduce demand and that's what's going to keep gas prices lower.	0
ClaimBuster	4796	It's kind of easy to do if you only have to pick up a $30-billion tab to defend your country.	0
ClaimBuster	4797	And we've watched this president actually turn away from some of the treaties that were on the table.	1
ClaimBuster	4798	That is why Senator wh- President Eisenhower was also correct in his policy in the Formosa Straits, where he declined, and refused to follow the recommendations - recommendations which Senator Kennedy voted for in 1955; again made in 1959; again repeated in his debates that you have heard - recommendations with regard to - again - slicing off a piece of free territory, and abandoning it, if - in effect, to the Communists.	1
ClaimBuster	4799	-- and we don't need more of them in the Senate or more of them in the House.	0
ClaimBuster	4800	Could I just respond to this, please?	0
ClaimBuster	4801	Our country has sold out to foreign lobbyists.	1
ClaimBuster	4802	I was with one company that makes valves and -- and process industries and they said, look, we were -- we were having some valves coming in that -- that were broken and we had to repair them under warranty and we looked them and -- and they had our serial number on them.	1
ClaimBuster	4803	And we find bad teachers another line of work.	0
ClaimBuster	4804	I did not say that the Arizona law was a model for the nation in that aspect.	1
ClaimBuster	4805	And now suddenly you're a big champion of coal.	0
ClaimBuster	4806	I've appointed prosecutors, I've appointed defenders.	1
ClaimBuster	4807	Now, for the people earning more than $200,000 a year, you're going to see a rollback to the level we were at with Bill Clinton, when people made a lot of money.	0
ClaimBuster	4808	They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance.	1
ClaimBuster	4809	We don't want to go back to that.	0
ClaimBuster	4810	Well, the -- John, 10 days ago, you said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.	1
ClaimBuster	4811	Well, thank you very much, Jim, for this opportunity.	0
ClaimBuster	4812	I believe that the more dependent we become on foreign oil, the less our national security is enhanced.	0
ClaimBuster	4813	First of all, let me say that I've spent more of my time and life on this in the last 12 years than any other issue.	1
ClaimBuster	4814	I think that would be a - a very serious mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	4815	And I promise you that that will happen.	0
ClaimBuster	4816	What we're going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology.	0
ClaimBuster	4817	I'm for free trade philosophically, but I have studied these trade agreements till the world has gone flat, and we don't have good trade agreements across the world.	0
ClaimBuster	4818	But we are protecting both of them.	0
ClaimBuster	4819	I think of people in the law enforcement community who are taking their lives in their hands everyday, when they go up to one of those doors and kick it down and try to stop this flow of drugs into our communities and into our kids.	0
ClaimBuster	4820	And the reason is crack babies being born, babies in the hospital 42 days.	1
ClaimBuster	4821	They are the best workers in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	4822	So I am convinced that together, we can, with the French, with the British, with the Germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect Iranian behavior.	0
ClaimBuster	4823	But keep in mind we are spending 30% more on health care than any country in the world, any country, and yet we have 35 million people uninsured, we have no preventing and primary care.	1
ClaimBuster	4824	I've talked with a number of them.	1
ClaimBuster	4825	In Africa - these countries that have newly joined the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	4826	I don't think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self-defense tradition.	0
ClaimBuster	4827	But as long as they have an economy that leaves so many people in dire poverty and unemployment, they are going to seek that employment across our borders.	1
ClaimBuster	4828	You see it in the church burnings.	0
ClaimBuster	4829	I'm going to do it in four years.	0
ClaimBuster	4830	Mr. Perot, with all respect, I think it is highly relevant, and I think that a 4-billion dollar budget of state and federal funds is not all that small, and I think the fact that I took a state that was one of the poorest states in the country and had been for 153 years and tried my best to modernize its economy and to make the kind of changes that have generated support from people like the presidents of Apple Computer and Hewlett-Packard and some of the biggest companies in this country, 24 retired generals and admirals and hundreds of business executives, are highly relevant.	1
ClaimBuster	4831	And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads.	1
ClaimBuster	4832	With regard to the freedom of the individual for choice with regard to abortion, there's one individual who's not being considered at all.	0
ClaimBuster	4833	If we'd listened to them, we would never have had a treaty.	0
ClaimBuster	4834	Well, in fact we saved 1,000 jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	4835	And we were -- we were opposed by the administration, another area where I differed with this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	4836	When we do that, instead of shutting the government down over a partisan fight over the budget, we're a better country and that's why we're making progress now.	0
ClaimBuster	4837	I presume the Vice President supported it when the President signed that bill and supports it now.	0
ClaimBuster	4838	Another one is how to address troubled areas of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	4839	Certainly I think all of us agree that when anybody has a government contract, certainly the money that is spent under that contract ought to be disbursed equally without regard to the race or creed or color of the individual who is to be employed.	0
ClaimBuster	4840	It called for uh - conservation measures so that we would save the energy that we have.	0
ClaimBuster	4841	I want to keep taxes low.	0
ClaimBuster	4842	I look around the world and I don't feel that you see North Korea, continuing to export their nuclear technology, Russia said they're not going to follow Nunn-Lugar any more.	1
ClaimBuster	4843	I'm going to stand by Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	4844	It will be a world of peace because we're going to have a clear sight of foreign policy based upon a strong military and a mission that stands by our friends.	0
ClaimBuster	4845	I commend you for supporting that.	0
ClaimBuster	4846	There's an interesting issue up in the northwest as well.	0
ClaimBuster	4847	Well, what they will say about us 100 years from now depends on how we keep our rendezvous with destiny.	0
ClaimBuster	4848	They are great scholars in all cases, and they're people of tremendous respect.	0
ClaimBuster	4849	And what are his health programs?	0
ClaimBuster	4850	The American people are beginning to vote across racial lines, and I hope it will happen more and more.	1
ClaimBuster	4851	You did -- suffered through that?	0
ClaimBuster	4852	All seniors will be covered, all poor seniors will have their prescription drugs paid for, and in the meantime, we'll have a plan to help poor seniors and in the meantime it could be one year or two years.	0
ClaimBuster	4853	I would propose to save the taxpayers of this country from that kind of costly boondoggle.	0
ClaimBuster	4854	I think the moment that you give to the union, on the one side, and to management, on the other side, the escape hatch of eventually going to government to get it settled, that most of these great strikes will end up being settled by government, and that will be a - be in the end, in my opinion, wage control; it would mean price control - all the things that we do not want.	0
ClaimBuster	4855	I think first of all, let me -- let me repeat -- let me repeat what I said.	0
ClaimBuster	4856	It's important, it's their future.	0
ClaimBuster	4857	Now, that's the kind of leadership that I want to provide as president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	4858	We need to reform these programs.	0
ClaimBuster	4859	We were very much involved at the U.N. on the sanction policy of the Bashir government in the Sudan.	1
ClaimBuster	4860	It's a strategy that we've been working on for a couple of years.	1
ClaimBuster	4861	I am against- an across-the-board pardon of draft evaders or military deserters.	0
ClaimBuster	4862	The government doesn't require you to do anything.	1
ClaimBuster	4863	At the same time, we put a limitation of thirteen hundred and twenty on MIRVs.	1
ClaimBuster	4864	And yet, because of the hard work of the American people and good policies, this economy is growing.	1
ClaimBuster	4865	And it won't help us grow.	0
ClaimBuster	4866	And my campaign is about getting this economy back on track, about creating jobs, about a brighter future for America.	0
ClaimBuster	4867	And I think a woman's right to choose ought to be protected and defended.	0
ClaimBuster	4868	We spend now 700 percent more on unemployment compensation than we did eight years ago when the Republicans took over the White House.	1
ClaimBuster	4869	Whether it's Syria, you name it.	0
ClaimBuster	4870	I think he's a good person.	0
ClaimBuster	4871	I'll probably get into a fight in this room with some but I happen to think that we need stronger death penalties for those that kill police officers.	0
ClaimBuster	4872	I know we can do a better job of clean coal technologies.	0
ClaimBuster	4873	Part of American leadership is making sure that we're doing nation building here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	4874	Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country.	0
ClaimBuster	4875	Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	4876	But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law.	1
ClaimBuster	4877	And if we find success we'll praise it.	0
ClaimBuster	4878	You cannot lead the world if you do not honor the contributions of those who are with us.	0
ClaimBuster	4879	And then it gets down to a question of values.	0
ClaimBuster	4880	And I suggested that if this is an insurance program, certainly the person who is paying in should be able to name his own beneficiary.	1
ClaimBuster	4881	In other words, we're going to take Joe's money, give it to Senator Obama, and let him spread the wealth around.	0
ClaimBuster	4882	Right now, the credit markets are frozen up and what that means, as a practical matter, is that small businesses and some large businesses just can't get loans.	1
ClaimBuster	4883	And I'm very proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	4884	In nuclear power we have increased the research and development, uh - under the Energy Research and Development Agency uh - very substantially, to insure that our ener- uh - nuclear power plants are safer, that they are more efficient, and that we have adequate safeguards.	1
ClaimBuster	4885	So we need to do a lot of things, but we ought to start with a better safety net.	0
ClaimBuster	4886	That's why tough choices will be required, choices I am prepared to make, Mr. Bush is not prepared to make.	0
ClaimBuster	4887	And they know this debt must come down as well, because it's unfair to our children.	0
ClaimBuster	4888	So we're now going to take Mosul.	0
ClaimBuster	4889	Our bonds with Israel are larger than agreements or disagreements on some details of diplomatic initiatives.	0
ClaimBuster	4890	Now are we going to have that when it isn't going to help the farmers?	0
ClaimBuster	4891	If I can answer the question.	0
ClaimBuster	4892	You're going to have plans that are so good, because we're going to have so much competition in the insurance industry.	0
ClaimBuster	4893	And these grain sales to the Soviet Union have helped us tremendously in meeting the costs of the additional oil and - the oil that we have bought from overseas.	1
ClaimBuster	4894	You know, every time we take rebels, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else, we're arming people.	1
ClaimBuster	4895	It would've been inconceivable ten - fifteen years ago, for us to be brought to our knees with an Arab oil embargo.	0
ClaimBuster	4896	And I've put ours together in something called the Agenda for American Renewal, and it makes sense, it's sensible, it creates jobs, it gets to the base of the kind of jobs we need.	0
ClaimBuster	4897	And in that there are some Medicaid provisions that will be very helpful to the very kind of people we're talking about here.	0
ClaimBuster	4898	Now, Senator Obama, you wanted to know one of the differences.	0
ClaimBuster	4899	If you're paying less than you paid a year or two ago, why, then, the strategy is working.	1
ClaimBuster	4900	Renee Proval (ph) is probably better off than he was four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	4901	And I'm against price controls.	1
ClaimBuster	4902	The measurement is: Are we as safe as we ought to be?	0
ClaimBuster	4903	Under this administration we've also had an inclination to keep separate the European countries, thinking that if they are separate, then we can dominate them and proceed with our secret, Lone Ranger-type diplomatic efforts.	0
ClaimBuster	4904	I believe that the uh - American people have been turned off in this election, uh - Mr. Maynard, for a variety of reasons.	0
ClaimBuster	4905	It's not like you want to close the loopholes.	0
ClaimBuster	4906	I get audited by the IRS.	1
ClaimBuster	4907	We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it's so dangerous.	1
ClaimBuster	4908	People who will strictly interpret the Constitution and not use the bench to write social policy.	0
ClaimBuster	4909	He said it was a mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	4910	So let's be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it.	0
ClaimBuster	4911	We've got to have a different energy plan.	0
ClaimBuster	4912	And if we - and the - actually this year Congress is doing a little better in controlling the growth of spending.	0
ClaimBuster	4913	Thirdly, whether or not we were prepared and trained to win.	0
ClaimBuster	4914	600,000 of whom, and maybe some of those have since gotten it, but as of a year ago 600,000 of them were actually eligible for it but they couldn't sign up for it because of the barriers that they had set up.	1
ClaimBuster	4915	We'll be resolute, we'll be strong, and we'll wage a comprehensive war against the terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	4916	But if we keep the lid on federal spending, which I think we can - with the help of the Congress, we can justify fully a $28 billion tax reduction.	0
ClaimBuster	4917	"He went on to say, ""Look at her."	1
ClaimBuster	4918	When Governor Reagan has been asked about that, he makes the very disturbing comment that non-proliferation, or the control of the spread of nuclear weapons, is none of our business.	1
ClaimBuster	4919	But the way -- if you look at what's happening, much tougher than they thought.	0
ClaimBuster	4920	I do support the other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill that strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen other ways of dealing with undocumented workers in this difficult area and dealing with the problem of settling people who have lived here for many, many years and do not have an established status.	0
ClaimBuster	4921	I wish he would join me, as a matter of fact, in appealing to the American people for the balanced budget amendment for the federal government and for the line-item veto.	0
ClaimBuster	4922	Uh - Mr. Ford has vetoed, as I said earlier, four times as many bills per year as Mr. Nixon.	1
ClaimBuster	4923	And I'm sure you'll try to do it again.	0
ClaimBuster	4924	We made uh - diplomatic uh - protests to the Cambodian government through the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	4925	The tax issue, because I think it's very important.	0
ClaimBuster	4926	I don't want to be sending parents away from children.	0
ClaimBuster	4927	Let us move now to the future.	0
ClaimBuster	4928	Take a look at the migration.	0
ClaimBuster	4929	I think of a teacher right here, largely Hispanic school, Jaime Escalante, teaching calculus to young kids, 80 percent of them going on to college.	1
ClaimBuster	4930	And the equal rights amendment only says that equality of rights shall not be abridged for omen b the Federal Government or by he state governments.	1
ClaimBuster	4931	John, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important.	0
ClaimBuster	4932	Our energy policies are a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	4933	Civil rights - uh has been confirmed by the Burger Court, hasn't been uh - reversed, and I don't think there's any inclination to reverse those basic decisions.	1
ClaimBuster	4934	We were peaceful when Mr. Ford went into office.	0
ClaimBuster	4935	I can't say for sure that we would have fewer federal employees when I go out of office than when I come in.	0
ClaimBuster	4936	With half of college kids graduating this year without a college -- excuse me, without a job.	1
ClaimBuster	4937	Well, first, I love great schools.	0
ClaimBuster	4938	And we will come home with victory and with honor.	0
ClaimBuster	4939	We need to shift from oil to coal.	0
ClaimBuster	4940	So we're now fighting for Mosul, that we had.	1
ClaimBuster	4941	Not a single young American is fighting or dying on any foreign soil tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	4942	Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989.	0
ClaimBuster	4943	I want to keep this expansion going.	0
ClaimBuster	4944	So, it's conceivable that Governor Romney could bring down gas prices because with his policies, we might be back in that same mess.	0
ClaimBuster	4945	We need a new approach.	0
ClaimBuster	4946	But look at that deal.	0
ClaimBuster	4947	And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	4948	And with each one of those decisions that affect the future of my country, I have learned in the process.	0
ClaimBuster	4949	We've set up the levels of funding and when it is deployable, I will deploy it.	0
ClaimBuster	4950	But I don't think these labels mean a thing and I would hope that tonight in the course of the rest of this campaign, we can have good solid disagreements on issues.	0
ClaimBuster	4951	And I believe it's a good idea, has strong bipartisan support.	0
ClaimBuster	4952	If you make less than $30,000 a year and you put $500 in a savings account, the federal government will match it with $1500.	1
ClaimBuster	4953	And I'd like to remind you, also, as a result of those recommendations, we've probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the Defense Department.	1
ClaimBuster	4954	They're stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology, hacking into our computers, counterfeiting our goods.	1
ClaimBuster	4955	I could run this string out a long time, but remember this, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	4956	And the right time was Tora Bora, when we had him cornered in the mountains.	0
ClaimBuster	4957	I wonder if the Governor would lend his support to that law.	0
ClaimBuster	4958	I hope you don't think that.	0
ClaimBuster	4959	I was not out there when that stock market dropped wringing my hands and saying this was the end of the world as some political leaders were, because it isn't the end of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	4960	But it takes presidential leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	4961	And it is silly putty, folks, and the American people have had enough of it.	0
ClaimBuster	4962	This -- the administration -- the administration indicated this was a reaction to a video and was a spontaneous reaction.	1
ClaimBuster	4963	Federal government doesn't do that.	1
ClaimBuster	4964	Our country now has no comprehensive energy program or policy.	1
ClaimBuster	4965	But those are the choices the next president of the United States is going to have to make.	0
ClaimBuster	4966	We have more people who qualify.	1
ClaimBuster	4967	I think the Congress should have uh - added another $10 billion reduction in personal income taxes, including the increase of personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars.	0
ClaimBuster	4968	I strongly believe in local control of schools.	0
ClaimBuster	4969	But I won't take them lightly.	0
ClaimBuster	4970	They can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and a United States president, me, who said we're not going to take any options off the table.	1
ClaimBuster	4971	Instead our aid continued to Batista, which was ineffective; we never were on the side of freedom; we never used our influence when we could have used it most effectively - and today Cuba is lost for freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	4972	And that's the kind of judge that I want.	0
ClaimBuster	4973	It's their route to the sea.	1
ClaimBuster	4974	Some of the states that have the toughest anti-gun laws have the highest levels of crime.	1
ClaimBuster	4975	And I'm not the one that compared the President of the United States rotting from like a dead fish from the head down.	0
ClaimBuster	4976	And we'll continue to do so over the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	4977	I do not say that.	1
ClaimBuster	4978	We continue to make it a priority for us to go after natural gas.	1
ClaimBuster	4979	And I think we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information.	0
ClaimBuster	4980	My answer to you is in the short-term we need to get after it here in America.	0
ClaimBuster	4981	You're not for school choice, you can't be for school choice, because this is that special interest money again.	0
ClaimBuster	4982	And you have to vote for somebody with a plan.	0
ClaimBuster	4983	And we've made it clear that working with our allies and others, that we are prepared to address any foreseeable eventuality which might interrupt commerce with that crucial area of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	4984	That's what governors ought to do.	0
ClaimBuster	4985	And that can only be done through governmental action.	0
ClaimBuster	4986	These are just ideas of what I would think of if I were in that position and had access to the information, and which I would know all the options that were open to me.	0
ClaimBuster	4987	The fact that we have the strongest economy in history today is not good enough.	0
ClaimBuster	4988	It's not just Donald Trump you're taxing.	0
ClaimBuster	4989	Yes, we should make a great effort.	0
ClaimBuster	4990	And he now completes this term with no progress toward arms control at all, but with a very dangerous arms race underway instead.	1
ClaimBuster	4991	So there will be different ratios in the House, as well as in the Senate, and as president I will be able to uh - work with that Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	4992	But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it?	0
ClaimBuster	4993	Because a lot of young women in this country take this right for granted and it could be lost.	0
ClaimBuster	4994	But it's -- the full faith and credit of the US, in spite of our difficulties, is still pretty good.	0
ClaimBuster	4995	"""So I said all right."	1
ClaimBuster	4996	I want to work for universal free school because we know from all the studies that the youngsters learn, kids learn more in the first few years of life than any where else.	1
ClaimBuster	4997	Let's talk about housing which the question was.	0
ClaimBuster	4998	And the president's been very busy running around the country using what I just described to you as a reason to say I'm wishy-washy, that I'm a flip-flopper.	0
ClaimBuster	4999	We are going to, as I say, we're busy trying to find the centers where these operations stem from, and retaliation will be taken.	0
ClaimBuster	5000	You treated him with terrible disrespect.	0
ClaimBuster	5001	So we're still in the fight.	0
ClaimBuster	5002	But I also believe strongly that we need to enforce laws on the books that the best way to make sure that we keep our society safe and secure is to hold people accountable for breaking the law.	0
ClaimBuster	5003	But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television.	1
ClaimBuster	5004	You see, I'd have found a way to sign that bill.	0
ClaimBuster	5005	Every American should be aware of the seriousness of the step.	0
ClaimBuster	5006	Colin Powell, our secretary of state, announced one day that we were going to continue the dialog of working with the North Koreans.	1
ClaimBuster	5007	That we must share in an ever-increasing scarcity.	0
ClaimBuster	5008	Do you know that Senator Obama has voted for -- is proposing $860 billion of new spending now?	1
ClaimBuster	5009	Now, I think that it's a matter of fundamental right that if we raise the minimum wage, 15 million Americans would be positively affected.	0
ClaimBuster	5010	And I want to express my appreciation to the League of Women Voters for adopting a course with which I believe the great majority of Americans are in agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	5011	It will be a huge down payment for a pretty darn good system.	0
ClaimBuster	5012	First of all is to recognize a tremendous economic strength in this country and to set the putting to - back to work of our people as a top priority.	0
ClaimBuster	5013	We did the right thing.	0
ClaimBuster	5014	There were hunting opportunities, for instance, that haven't previously been available and so forth, so it was a mutually agreed- upon piece of legislation.	1
ClaimBuster	5015	But as a president, I have to represent all the people in the nation.	0
ClaimBuster	5016	And -- and that kind of top -- top-down economics, where folks at the top are doing well, so the average person making $3 million is getting a $250,000 tax break, while middle-class families are burdened further, that's not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth.	1
ClaimBuster	5017	I have fought against spending.	1
ClaimBuster	5018	Everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state.	0
ClaimBuster	5019	It's a sick art form.	0
ClaimBuster	5020	The Head Start program full funding would cost about 5 billion more.	1
ClaimBuster	5021	The president and I have always agreed on that.	1
ClaimBuster	5022	I also believe that we should offer college scholarships to people who will agree to work them off as police officers, and I think, as we reduce our military forces, we should let people earn military retirement by coming out and working as police officers.	0
ClaimBuster	5023	I was sworn to uphold the laws of my state.	1
ClaimBuster	5024	Somebody hit me and said Barry Goldwater said you ought to talk on issues more.	1
ClaimBuster	5025	We differ on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, as I have said.	1
ClaimBuster	5026	We've also got uh - a comparison between himself and Mr. Nixon.	0
ClaimBuster	5027	And the president's right in terms of the additional oil production, but none of it came on federal land.	1
ClaimBuster	5028	But it would require what is known as secondary or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground.	0
ClaimBuster	5029	I want the next president to have fast track negotiating authority to open up markets around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	5030	Four hundred billion, approximately, is a result of what individuals do.	1
ClaimBuster	5031	To the extent humanly possible, we get that out.	0
ClaimBuster	5032	We are going to invest in information technology to eliminate bureaucracy and make the system more efficient.	0
ClaimBuster	5033	So I've been working on it when I was a governor for a long time.	1
ClaimBuster	5034	The disagreement I have with Governor Romney is that, during the course of this campaign, he's often talked as if we should take premature military action.	1
ClaimBuster	5035	The way I see it, the world is getting much closer together.	0
ClaimBuster	5036	We cannot move to the extreme.	0
ClaimBuster	5037	I remember when the stories first came out about the stops in New Jersey by the highway patrol there.	0
ClaimBuster	5038	They're growing at 8 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	5039	So what we've got to do is control it, let it grow for inflation, let it grow for the amount of new people added, population, and then hold the line.	0
ClaimBuster	5040	Then I'm going to have a top down review at the Pentagon, not a bottom up review.	0
ClaimBuster	5041	And like John McCain, I have learned from experience, and it's not a new position for me.	0
ClaimBuster	5042	I have a clear record of reaching across the aisle, whether it be Joe Lieberman or Russ Feingold or Ted Kennedy or others.	1
ClaimBuster	5043	And the kind of defense program that Mr. Carter wants will mean a weaker defense and a poor negotiating position.	0
ClaimBuster	5044	The president said by now we'd be a 5.4 percent unemployment.	1
ClaimBuster	5045	I want to make sure take-home pay turns around and starts to grow.	0
ClaimBuster	5046	I want to be the best president I can be for every American.	0
ClaimBuster	5047	So I'd like to ask you right now, why don't you give back the money that you've taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly?	0
ClaimBuster	5048	They're going to start hiring people.	0
ClaimBuster	5049	And actually -- well, that was very interesting.	0
ClaimBuster	5050	Mr. Ford has vetoed four times as many bills as Mr. Nixon - per year.	1
ClaimBuster	5051	You had loan officers were -- that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn't have been given, because the folks didn't qualify.	1
ClaimBuster	5052	That's pennies on the dollar compared to renewing the cold war.	0
ClaimBuster	5053	We're moving into a new competitive age, and we need that kind of thing.	0
ClaimBuster	5054	We still have trillion-dollar deficits.	1
ClaimBuster	5055	And there are a host of options that this president had available to him, like making sure that at all our ports in America containers are inspected.	0
ClaimBuster	5056	To go into a Catholic mass in a beautiful cathedral in New York under the cause of helping in AIDS and start throwing condoms around in the mass, I'm sorry, I think it sets back the cause.	0
ClaimBuster	5057	You're not going to go without food and you're not going to go without medical care.	0
ClaimBuster	5058	These women -- the woman on the plane, the -- I think they want either fame or her campaign did it.	0
ClaimBuster	5059	A great big company can buy -- Ross has got a good-sized company, been very successful.	1
ClaimBuster	5060	Georgia in particular is now on the brink of enormous economic challenges.	0
ClaimBuster	5061	Jim, there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer.	0
ClaimBuster	5062	That's what he said the other day, and that's simply not the case.	1
ClaimBuster	5063	And you need to know the record here.	0
ClaimBuster	5064	I'm thinking of Ross Perot's running mate sitting in the jail.	0
ClaimBuster	5065	Look, when we think about immigration, we have to understand there are folks all around the world who still see America as the land of promise.	0
ClaimBuster	5066	Maybe I am, but I just don't think that's right.	0
ClaimBuster	5067	I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people.	1
ClaimBuster	5068	Give them a tax moratorium for a period if they build and develop there.	0
ClaimBuster	5069	Former chief of the -- Joint Chiefs of Staff said that -- Admiral Mullen said that our debt is the biggest national security threat we face.	1
ClaimBuster	5070	But that's as far as I would go with it.	0
ClaimBuster	5071	What were her written instructions?	0
ClaimBuster	5072	In spite of the economic problems, we're the most respected economy around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	5073	That, to me, is the key.	0
ClaimBuster	5074	But I feel strongly that marriage should be between a man and a woman.	0
ClaimBuster	5075	I have a plan for that.	0
ClaimBuster	5076	That is not free trade.	0
ClaimBuster	5077	And I want seniors to have additional choices when it comes to choosing their health care plans.	0
ClaimBuster	5078	Whenever a weapon is tested we count the number of warheads on it, and whenever that warhead is used we count that number of warheads, whether they have that number or less on it, or not.	1
ClaimBuster	5079	And I think that's shocking; it's shameful.	0
ClaimBuster	5080	You need to test every year.	0
ClaimBuster	5081	Now, it's our turn to take that torch.	0
ClaimBuster	5082	That's the kind of leadership that we'll continue to show.	0
ClaimBuster	5083	His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information.	1
ClaimBuster	5084	I disagree with much of what she's fighting for.	0
ClaimBuster	5085	I mean, he's also a strong ally in the war on terror.	0
ClaimBuster	5086	We have the greatest businesspeople in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	5087	I have cut defense spending.	1
ClaimBuster	5088	In my own state, we did it.	1
ClaimBuster	5089	But I do not believe that that line in case of war should be drawn on those islands but instead on the island of Formosa.	0
ClaimBuster	5090	And I saw families there who showed me there where missiles had come down near their children's bedrooms.	1
ClaimBuster	5091	And I wonder if it's our fault, the candidates' fault.	0
ClaimBuster	5092	It doesn't mean that you invite them over for tea one day.	0
ClaimBuster	5093	Well, Jim, first of all, I would like to thank the sponsors of this debate and the people of Boston for hosting the debate.	0
ClaimBuster	5094	Ambassador, anybody on my team would play politics or mislead when we've lost four of our own, governor, is offensive.	0
ClaimBuster	5095	I think it's important to promote a culture of life.	0
ClaimBuster	5096	In eight years they haven't gotten anything done on Medicare, on Social Security, a patient's bill of rights.	0
ClaimBuster	5097	We don't need across-the-board tax cuts for the wealthy for nothing.	0
ClaimBuster	5098	And the last point I wanna make is this: Mr. Ford, Mr. Kissinger have uh - continued on with the policies and failures of Richard Nixon.	0
ClaimBuster	5099	I know Americans had seen jobs being shipped overseas; businesses and workers not getting a level playing field when it came to trade.	1
ClaimBuster	5100	-- because if the American people send me there, we'll get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	5101	But now we've got the lines too carefully drawn here.	0
ClaimBuster	5102	I refer, for example, to distressed areas.	0
ClaimBuster	5103	It wasn't me that was there at that convention.	1
ClaimBuster	5104	The governor is the chief executive officer.	1
ClaimBuster	5105	Over the last 15, over the last 20 years.	0
ClaimBuster	5106	This is an issue that divides America, but certainly reasonable people can agree on how to reduce abortions in America.	0
ClaimBuster	5107	In this particular situation, no.	0
ClaimBuster	5108	You know, I've been privileged to see the presidency up close.	1
ClaimBuster	5109	Now, I have talked to the chairmen of the committees that want this.	1
ClaimBuster	5110	So what I'm trying to do is just talk the truth to the American people and to the world.	0
ClaimBuster	5111	This is a -- this is an important election and I'm concerned about America.	0
ClaimBuster	5112	There are some things that I think have to be done.	0
ClaimBuster	5113	You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.	1
ClaimBuster	5114	But I can take it.	0
ClaimBuster	5115	You have a differential in wages right now.	1
ClaimBuster	5116	When he talks about getting tough on China, keep in mind that Governor Romney invested in companies that were pioneers of outsourcing to China, and is currently investing in countries -- in companies that are building surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks.	1
ClaimBuster	5117	He always talks about Arkansas having a balanced budget and they do, but he has a balanced budget amendment.	1
ClaimBuster	5118	But on the other hand, I found on July fourth of this year, a new spirit born in America.	0
ClaimBuster	5119	I'm very glad to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	5120	And I'm convinced now, more than I was when I got the nomination, that Walter Mondale was the right choice, And I believe this is a good indication of the kind of people I would choose in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	5121	Well, I've heard -- I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country.	0
ClaimBuster	5122	It will not be a re-ignition of the Cold War, but Russia is a challenge.	0
ClaimBuster	5123	We found the people who could least afford it - people on retired incomes uh - people on fixed incomes - we found them unable to meet their bills at the end of the month.	1
ClaimBuster	5124	Well, everything you've heard just now from Donald is not true.	1
ClaimBuster	5125	And that's why it's going to be so important for us to work with homeowners to make sure that they can stay in their homes.	0
ClaimBuster	5126	You've had a number of occasions to see in detail what the plan is, and at least you'll understand it.	1
ClaimBuster	5127	He wanted that said -- 4 years.	1
ClaimBuster	5128	And I'm happy to talk to you, Joe, too, if you're out there.	0
ClaimBuster	5129	And we face -- this deficit could crush the future generations.	0
ClaimBuster	5130	What I think we need, however, is not just that but to move forward, not just congratulating ourselves but challenging ourselves to get on with the business of dealing with America's problems.	0
ClaimBuster	5131	"We're also going to have to work with the Karzai government, and when I met with President Karzai, I was very clear that, ""You are going to have to do better by your people in order for us to gain the popular support that's necessary."""	1
ClaimBuster	5132	They just wouldn't do it, and everybody now knows the terrible price they're paying by waiting until it's obvious to the brain-dead that they have problems.	0
ClaimBuster	5133	And if they can't do it, if the Congress can't do it, let them then have to do it across the board.	0
ClaimBuster	5134	Well among my other experiences in the past, I've - I've been a nuclear engineer, and did graduate work in this field.	1
ClaimBuster	5135	If my recollection is correct he indicated that uh - General Brown was not qualified to be a sewer commissioner.	0
ClaimBuster	5136	We were together at a humorous event a little earlier, and it's nice to maybe funny this time, not on purpose.	1
ClaimBuster	5137	I believe we need some fairness.	0
ClaimBuster	5138	I would like to stand here and promise the American people a tax cut, as Governor Reagan has done.	0
ClaimBuster	5139	Of course we're worried about Osama bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	5140	They've never seen anything happen in that town.	0
ClaimBuster	5141	They're all nice people, they're just in a bad system.	0
ClaimBuster	5142	Let me s- look also at what I did.	0
ClaimBuster	5143	And in the term that I've been president - some two years - we have reduced federal employment by eleven thousand.	1
ClaimBuster	5144	That is not a recipe for growth.	0
ClaimBuster	5145	Every time I had a vacancy on the Georgia Supreme Court - and I filled five of those vacancies out of seven total and about half the court of appeals judges, about 35 percent of the trial judges - I was given from an objective panel the five most highly qualified persons in Georgia.	1
ClaimBuster	5146	I think we can do that in a way that represents what America is all about, which is equal opportunity and an opportunity for people to realize their potential.	0
ClaimBuster	5147	I want workers to have their own assets.	0
ClaimBuster	5148	There are several things that can be done specifically that are not now being done.	0
ClaimBuster	5149	I ask you for your trust.	0
ClaimBuster	5150	Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle, and before he did it, he said, watch my choice for vice president, it will tell all And it sure did.	1
ClaimBuster	5151	You need somebody working for you and you've got to have somebody in Washington who is thinking about the middle class and not just those who can afford to hire lobbyists.	0
ClaimBuster	5152	You know, Moammar Gadhafi had more American blood on his hands than any individual other than Osama bin Laden.	1
ClaimBuster	5153	And so if you believe the same thing, you just don't want to raise taxes on people.	0
ClaimBuster	5154	I think that we have to return -- particularly in defense spending, which is the largest part of our appropriations -- we have to do away with cost-plus contracts.	0
ClaimBuster	5155	It's going to be a test of our strength.	0
ClaimBuster	5156	The United States foreign policy under this administration has been one of progress and success.	0
ClaimBuster	5157	You stay around this long enough, you think about -- if you talk about it in Washington, you think you did it.	0
ClaimBuster	5158	The bill originally covered employers of 25 and more, but because of opposition, we went up to 50.	1
ClaimBuster	5159	It's a remarkable thing in a country like ours, a man who grew up in Russell, Kansas, and one who was born to a widowed mother in Hope, Arkansas, could wind up running for president.	0
ClaimBuster	5160	And you supported legislation this year that's involved tax increases not once, but twice.	1
ClaimBuster	5161	"I knew we'd have somebody out there yelling ""read my lips"", and I did it because I thought it was right."	0
ClaimBuster	5162	The history of our relationship with Iran goes back to the days of President Truman when he decided that it was vitally necessary for our own security as well as that of Iran, that we should help that country, and Iran has been a good ally.	1
ClaimBuster	5163	Now when Governor Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt.	0
ClaimBuster	5164	And we'll have time to deal with the long-term problems of the baby boomers.	0
ClaimBuster	5165	No, I don't happen to share that goal.	0
ClaimBuster	5166	We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake.	0
ClaimBuster	5167	According to one study that was published a short time ago - the Harvard Business School study - indicated that just in the commercial sector alone of the economy, we could save between 30% and 40% of the energy that we consume in this country today.	1
ClaimBuster	5168	Because people shouldn't be taxed twice on their assets.	0
ClaimBuster	5169	We're encouraging it and working with the industry.	1
ClaimBuster	5170	And that's a big, big factor.	0
ClaimBuster	5171	And we will have a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent.	0
ClaimBuster	5172	So what I don't know is what the unexpected will be.	0
ClaimBuster	5173	That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	5174	Working together, we can do wonderful things for the United States and the Free World.	0
ClaimBuster	5175	I don't know what the differences might be, because I don't know what Mr. Carter's policies are.	0
ClaimBuster	5176	The federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy.	1
ClaimBuster	5177	If you don't agree, if you don't think that this course that we've been on for the last four years is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have.	0
ClaimBuster	5178	And yet she didn't know the word -- the letter C on a document.	1
ClaimBuster	5179	And you know, afterwards, we spent a lot of time with them.	1
ClaimBuster	5180	"Faith without works is dead. """	0
ClaimBuster	5181	Well, we have a tradition of local control of the schools and that's a tradition that has served us well.	1
ClaimBuster	5182	And the rest of my minute, I want to make a very brief comment here in terms of Saddam Hussein.	0
ClaimBuster	5183	People care a lot about their land and care about their environment.	0
ClaimBuster	5184	And if it's rape, how do you draw moral judgments on that?	0
ClaimBuster	5185	Khan network has been brought to justice.	1
ClaimBuster	5186	I see our influence receding, in part because of the failure of the president to deal with our economic challenges at home; in part because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military in the way I think it ought to be; in part because of the -- the -- the turmoil with Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	5187	Part of that is because we've stood still here at home, because we haven't met our problems in the United States, because we haven't had a moving economy.	0
ClaimBuster	5188	So, that was the only place that that was used.	1
ClaimBuster	5189	I went to college in this great city, and most of my peers felt against the war as I did.	1
ClaimBuster	5190	So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages.	1
ClaimBuster	5191	Because this is the stimulation, the incentive for companies to go out and explore for oil, to develop it.	0
ClaimBuster	5192	Anything that would preserve, or help us use less energy, that would be fine, and I'm for it.	0
ClaimBuster	5193	And the difference between Arkansas and the US is that we're going in the right direction and this country's going in the wrong direction.	0
ClaimBuster	5194	Now it's lower than the nine-point-point-two percent growth in the first quarter, and it's lower than the uh 5 percent growth in the second quarter.	1
ClaimBuster	5195	There is a considerable anti-Washington feeling throughout the country.	0
ClaimBuster	5196	Not because we coddled them, but because the Administration was pushed into doing something about it.	0
ClaimBuster	5197	When you stop and think that we are only drilling on 2%.	1
ClaimBuster	5198	Is Iran talking to Iraq about peace?	0
ClaimBuster	5199	Prime Minister Allawi believes they want to.	0
ClaimBuster	5200	We like free enterprise, but you got to play by the rules.	0
ClaimBuster	5201	And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case.	1
ClaimBuster	5202	But there have been too many instances during the course of my presidency, where I've had to comfort families who have lost somebody.	1
ClaimBuster	5203	But this president didn't try to fix it.	1
ClaimBuster	5204	What we got to do is keep working, as the Labor Dept is doing a first-class job on, to break down discrimination, to break down the glass ceiling.	1
ClaimBuster	5205	He was furious because he told me that it was the action of me, President Ford, that saved the lives of the crew of the Mayaguez.	1
ClaimBuster	5206	So did Governor Thompson, so did Governor Rowland.	1
ClaimBuster	5207	I'm sure I'll do it before it's over.	0
ClaimBuster	5208	Those stem- cells lines already existed.	1
ClaimBuster	5209	But if you're going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be determined by states in localities where they're raising and spending most of the money.	0
ClaimBuster	5210	And you've confirmed once again the fundamental decency and generosity of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	5211	I also want to go to Washington to get some positive things done.	0
ClaimBuster	5212	I supported him on NAFTA and GATT.	1
ClaimBuster	5213	The Vice President's plan does not have annual accountability, third grade, fourth grade, fifth grade.	1
ClaimBuster	5214	And I've got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party.	0
ClaimBuster	5215	I could have gone on forever.	0
ClaimBuster	5216	Believe me, people with AIDS are more than willing to take that risk.	0
ClaimBuster	5217	And that kind of credibility is precisely why we've been able to show leadership on a wide range of issues facing the world right now.	0
ClaimBuster	5218	I -- I think the tension that existed between Israel and the United States was very unfortunate.	0
ClaimBuster	5219	I think we have to do is invest in American jobs, American education, control American health care costs and bring the American people together again.	0
ClaimBuster	5220	Certainly we can find a coffeepot that costs something less than $7,000.	1
ClaimBuster	5221	But personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that.	0
ClaimBuster	5222	We now have one extreme for instance, of some welfare recipients, who by taking advantage of the welfare laws, the housing laws, the uh - Medicaid uh - laws, and the uh - food stamp laws, make over $10 thousand a year and uh - they don't have to pay any taxes on it.	1
ClaimBuster	5223	Now, in contrast, Senator McCain wants to give a $300 billion tax cut, $200 billion of it to the largest corporations and a hundred thousand of it -- a hundred billion of it going to people like CEOs on Wall Street.	1
ClaimBuster	5224	And number three, we are going to find out who did this and we're going to hunt them down, because one of the things that I've said throughout my presidency is when folks mess with Americans, we go after them.	0
ClaimBuster	5225	And as far as the absolute gap is concerned, we find that the United States is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	5226	We've got a - a sharp distinction drawn between white collar crime - the - the - the big shots who are rich, who are influential uh very seldom go to jail; those who are poor and - and who have uh no influence - uh quite often are the ones who are punished.	0
ClaimBuster	5227	I do hope you will read our plans.	0
ClaimBuster	5228	And the confidence that those countries recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops there.	0
ClaimBuster	5229	And as the governor of Massachusetts knows, there was no evidence that governor - that Mr. Noriega was involved in drugs, no hard evidence until we indicted him.	1
ClaimBuster	5230	One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12.	1
ClaimBuster	5231	I do not believe in cutting our military.	0
ClaimBuster	5232	And, unfortunately, Governor Romney's budget and his proposals would not allow us to make those investments.	0
ClaimBuster	5233	But by itself, that to me can bring into play a fundamental American strategic interest because I think it's based on our values.	0
ClaimBuster	5234	By 1965 or 1970, will there be other Cubas in Latin America?	0
ClaimBuster	5235	We just have a big difference on where this country should be led, and in what direction it ought to go.	0
ClaimBuster	5236	I - I have to say that my campaign has been an open one.	0
ClaimBuster	5237	When a drug comes in from Canada, I want to make sure it cures you and doesn't kill you.	0
ClaimBuster	5238	But it's not a statement about his heart.	0
ClaimBuster	5239	But it was a calculated risk that paid off.	0
ClaimBuster	5240	But I also believe that everybody should have a fair shot and everybody should do their fair share and everybody should play by the same rules, because that's how our economy's grown.	0
ClaimBuster	5241	He refers to one tax increase.	1
ClaimBuster	5242	Well, the president and his experts have told America that it's not a question of if; it's a question of when.	1
ClaimBuster	5243	We're not going to allow Iran to perpetually engage in negotiations that lead nowhere.	0
ClaimBuster	5244	And I've never discussed Whitewater, as I've told you personally.	1
ClaimBuster	5245	If someday, somebody comes along with an answer, that's something else.	0
ClaimBuster	5246	And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who's her friend and not a good guy, by the way.	1
ClaimBuster	5247	I've heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible.	0
ClaimBuster	5248	And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities.	0
ClaimBuster	5249	But even more importantly, you worry about the future and will they have the same opportunities that you and I have had.	0
ClaimBuster	5250	We both made promises in this campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	5251	The one major decision that I have made since acquiring the nomination, and I share this with President Ford, is the choice of a vice president.	0
ClaimBuster	5252	And they don't want this deadly new effort to bring weapons into the heavens.	0
ClaimBuster	5253	They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants.	0
ClaimBuster	5254	And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments.	1
ClaimBuster	5255	I gave you back some of that time.	0
ClaimBuster	5256	We were threatened by a veto if we passed a dollar and a quarter - it's extremely difficult with the great power that the president does to pass any bill when the president is opposed to it.	1
ClaimBuster	5257	I consider myself in the mainstream of my party.	0
ClaimBuster	5258	I want to move forward, I want this nation to move forward.	0
ClaimBuster	5259	This man has been disparaging my plan with all this Washington fuzzy math.	0
ClaimBuster	5260	Every President who has served in the Oval Office since Harry Truman has been dedicated to the proposition of controlling nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	5261	So you've got to create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	5262	Let's get to their questions.	0
ClaimBuster	5263	And I think there may be a couple of reasons.	0
ClaimBuster	5264	You can be on welfare.	0
ClaimBuster	5265	People will be able to take their HMO insurance company to court.	0
ClaimBuster	5266	You should not in the process penalize the legitimate handgun owner.	0
ClaimBuster	5267	We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess.	1
ClaimBuster	5268	They're doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.	0
ClaimBuster	5269	Now, she can say that her husband did well, but, boy, did they suffer as NAFTA kicked in, because it didn't really kick in very much, but it kicked in after they left.	0
ClaimBuster	5270	It's a difference between government making decisions for you and you getting more of your money to make decisions for yourself.	1
ClaimBuster	5271	And, Candy, we haven't had a chance to talk about education much, but I think it is very important to understand that the reforms we've put in place, working with 46 governors around the country, are seeing schools that are some of the ones that are the toughest for kids starting to succeed.	1
ClaimBuster	5272	First, I've suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we don't need and we can't afford.	0
ClaimBuster	5273	The other thing is that we have only leased out - begun to explore - 2% of our outer continental shelf for oil, where it is believed, by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy, that there are vast supplies yet to be found.	1
ClaimBuster	5274	And my opponent's plans lead me to conclude that Saddam Hussein would still be in power, and the world would be more dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	5275	I wanna see our nation - return to a posture and an image and a standard to make us proud once again.	0
ClaimBuster	5276	And then we had a recession and we got attacked, which cost us 1 million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	5277	And the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they aren't making seniors any healthier.	1
ClaimBuster	5278	It hasn't worked out that way.	0
ClaimBuster	5279	Senator Obama is the chairperson of a committee that oversights NATO that's in Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	5280	My opponent thought there was weapons there.	0
ClaimBuster	5281	A half a million manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last four years.	1
ClaimBuster	5282	I believe that I can't legislate or transfer to another American citizen my article of faith.	0
ClaimBuster	5283	It contains twenty-five percent of all the members of the General Assembly.	1
ClaimBuster	5284	And that is why, in this field, I have made recommendations which I am confident will move the American economy ahead - move it firmly and soundly so that there will never be a time when the Soviet Union will be able to challenge our superiority in this field.	0
ClaimBuster	5285	I think we -- I think we should make it the number one priority to make our schools the best in the world, all of them.	0
ClaimBuster	5286	Because someone didn't meet exactly our standards of human rights, even though they were an ally of ours, instead of trying patiently to persuade them to change their ways, we have, in a number of instances, aided a revolutionary overthrow which results in complete totalitarianism, instead, for those people.	1
ClaimBuster	5287	I think this is a very important moment for our country.	0
ClaimBuster	5288	One of the major issues in this campaign is trust.	0
ClaimBuster	5289	And if we don't act today, the problem will be valued in the trillions.	0
ClaimBuster	5290	If you're poor, they pay all of it.	1
ClaimBuster	5291	I did it as a security measure to be sure, because I would rather see us reduce the consumption of imported oil than have to send American boys to fight in the Persian Gulf.	0
ClaimBuster	5292	We have reduced the military manpower by a million four hundred thousand.	1
ClaimBuster	5293	I know how to get him.	0
ClaimBuster	5294	Senator Obama has $800 billion in new spending programs.	1
ClaimBuster	5295	We better get it right now.	0
ClaimBuster	5296	Senator Obama wants to set up health care bureaucracies, take over the health care of America through -- as he said, his object is a single payer system.	1
ClaimBuster	5297	Now, remember, folks, even Senator Dole's campaign co-chair here, Senator D'Amato, says he's got to cut Medicare to pay for this.	1
ClaimBuster	5298	conservative projections out for the next five years, that indicates that this plan would, by 1983, result in a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	5299	They had thirty of them; we had seven of them.	1
ClaimBuster	5300	He's 3 years into this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	5301	If you throw another 50,000 kids on the street because of cutting recklessly in troop levels, you're going to put a lot more out of work.	0
ClaimBuster	5302	But I think it's unconscionable, Ann, that we should be talking or thinking about imposing new taxes on average Americans when there are billions out there, over $100 billion, in taxes owed that aren't being paid.	1
ClaimBuster	5303	And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	5304	Thank you for your question.	0
ClaimBuster	5305	Look, 95 percent of our containers coming into this country are not inspected today.	1
ClaimBuster	5306	Freedom is on the march.	0
ClaimBuster	5307	That's Washington in a nutshell right there.	0
ClaimBuster	5308	Now, our relations with Pakistan are critical, because the border areas are being used as safe havens by the Taliban and Al Qaida and other extremist organizations, and we have to get their support.	1
ClaimBuster	5309	It caused me to disrupt my private life and my business to get involved in this activity.	0
ClaimBuster	5310	The key is making sure that the next treasury secretary understands that it's not enough just to help those at the top.	0
ClaimBuster	5311	I think that's a big mistake, because I think we have to stay at the cutting edge.	0
ClaimBuster	5312	First, we've had Muslims in America since George Washington.	1
ClaimBuster	5313	And to take a chance uh - now be - and not make every effort that we could make to provide for some control over these weapons, I think would be a great mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	5314	And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting.	0
ClaimBuster	5315	And I am convinced that my record, going back to my opposition from sending the Marines to Lebanon, to supporting our efforts in Kosovo and Bosnia and the first Gulf War, and my judgment, I think, is something that I'm -- a record that I'm willing to stand on.	1
ClaimBuster	5316	He better not be or there's going to be a consequence should I be the president.	0
ClaimBuster	5317	And then you've got to fix it and do something with it.	0
ClaimBuster	5318	The report following the explosion of the barracks disclosed that we had not taken any of the steps that we should have taken.	1
ClaimBuster	5319	And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from.	1
ClaimBuster	5320	We'll continue to reach out.	0
ClaimBuster	5321	And that's just a fact.	1
ClaimBuster	5322	But let me simply say for the record, I did not vote to cut COLAs.	1
ClaimBuster	5323	He called the Arizona law a model for the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	5324	But she's lied about a lot of things.	1
ClaimBuster	5325	I want to be very serious.	0
ClaimBuster	5326	On the other hand, uh when you have a bill of that magnitude, with - tho- those many provisions, a president has to sit and decide if there's more good than bad.	0
ClaimBuster	5327	And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.	0
ClaimBuster	5328	It was the Reagan-Bush administration that brought this man to justice.	1
ClaimBuster	5329	But over time, what they can do is regain credibility.	0
ClaimBuster	5330	We can, in other words, negotiate many of these items of difference between us without going to the summit.	0
ClaimBuster	5331	And the sooner they start, the sooner they'll finish.	0
ClaimBuster	5332	The Arab boycott action was first taken in 1952.	1
ClaimBuster	5333	I want to say just a couple of things.	0
ClaimBuster	5334	We're spending about $7 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	5335	He had the capability of making weapons, and he would have made weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	5336	One of his bills that was overridden - he only got one vote in the Senate and seven votes in the House, from Republicans.	1
ClaimBuster	5337	The secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating.	1
ClaimBuster	5338	We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.	1
ClaimBuster	5339	And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.	0
ClaimBuster	5340	And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do...	0
ClaimBuster	5341	But certainly we're not going to have peace by giving in and indicating in advance that we are not going to defend what has become a symbol of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	5342	And we pushed our allies aside.	0
ClaimBuster	5343	We need to sit down and reauthorize it.	0
ClaimBuster	5344	We didn't even have a Bureau of African Affairs until 1957.	1
ClaimBuster	5345	But instead, we've seen in nation after nation, a number of disturbing events.	0
ClaimBuster	5346	But I think there is also a national responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	5347	I -- I'm -- I feel very deeply sympathetic for the families of those who lost loved ones.	0
ClaimBuster	5348	But you isolate China and turn them inward, and then we've made a tremendous mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	5349	That's the only way you can bring real economic pressure on the Castro regime - and also the countries of Western Europe, Canada, Japan and the others.	0
ClaimBuster	5350	Whether it's two parents working because one has to pay the taxes and one has to provide for the family, whether it's a single parent who just barely pays the pressing bills or whether you're worried about an education for your children going to the best schools, or whether you're worried about safe playgrounds, drug-free schools, crime-free schools.	0
ClaimBuster	5351	Because the deficit now has been building up for 12 years.	1
ClaimBuster	5352	It's much less than that.	1
ClaimBuster	5353	And I try to do a lot of things that I think might be helpful to people.	0
ClaimBuster	5354	And if they don't, they wind up in prison.	0
ClaimBuster	5355	And we can do so in an environmentally friendly way.	0
ClaimBuster	5356	So there are a lot of good things in this bill we should have done instead of trying this massive, massive takeover by the Federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	5357	Senator Obama voted against Justice Breyer and Justice Roberts on the grounds that they didn't meet his ideological standards.	1
ClaimBuster	5358	We have this incredible prosperity, but a lot of people have been left behind.	1
ClaimBuster	5359	If I could respond, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	5360	I don't want to kill jobs in this environment.	0
ClaimBuster	5361	And may God continue to bless our great land.	0
ClaimBuster	5362	We've had a chance to spell out our differences on the Pledge of Allegiance here tonight and on tough sentencing of drug king pins and this kind of thing.	0
ClaimBuster	5363	But we were far stronger relative to the Communists five years ago, and what is of great concern is that the balance of power is in danger of moving with them.	1
ClaimBuster	5364	You can pull it off of the Internet.	0
ClaimBuster	5365	If you want to help somebody, don't run the costs up by making doctors have to have 5 or 6 tests where one would do for fear of being sued, or have somebody along the highway not stop to pick up a guy and help him because he's afraid a trial lawyer will come along and sue him.	0
ClaimBuster	5366	I just told you the criteria on which I'll appoint judges.	1
ClaimBuster	5367	Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I -- if I'm fortunate...	0
ClaimBuster	5368	More people are working harder for less, 100,000 people a month losing their health insurance, unemployment going up, our economy slowing down.	1
ClaimBuster	5369	Well, the primary responsibility for education is -- is, of course, at the state and local level.	0
ClaimBuster	5370	The United States must be a nation strong; the United States must be a nation secure.	0
ClaimBuster	5371	There is no way you can be strong militarily and have those kind of reductions in our military uh - appropriation.	0
ClaimBuster	5372	We can't afford that in the next eight years and Senator Obama, with the Democrats in charge of Congress, things have gotten worse.	0
ClaimBuster	5373	For the first time in history, you pay about 40 percent of what you earn.	1
ClaimBuster	5374	Got a Republican Congress cutting spending finally and he said it's the best four years ever.	1
ClaimBuster	5375	We'll do exactly what we did in the 1990s.	0
ClaimBuster	5376	Now as far as the balance of the world is concerned, I of course don't have as much time as Senator Kennedy had.	0
ClaimBuster	5377	"And I said, ""How many uh - adults here are out of work?"""	1
ClaimBuster	5378	I just disagree with Mr. Perot.	0
ClaimBuster	5379	I want to give people permanent incentives on investment tax credit, like President Kennedy and the Congress inaugurated in the early '60s to get industry moving again; a research and development tax credit; a low-income housing tax credit; a long-term capital gains proposal for new business and business expansions.	1
ClaimBuster	5380	The uh - fact is that secrecy has surrounded the decisions made by the Ford administration.	0
ClaimBuster	5381	And it's just predicated on very modest, but I think accurate, projections of employment increases and uh - a growth in our national economy equal to what was experienced under Kennedy, Johnson, before the Vietnam War.	0
ClaimBuster	5382	But if we snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and adopt Senator Obama's plan, then we will have a wider war and it will make things more complicated throughout the region, including in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	5383	Governor Reagan, again, typically is against such a proposal.	0
ClaimBuster	5384	But I can guarantee it will not come if Gerald Ford is reelected and this present policy is continued; it will come if I'm elected.	0
ClaimBuster	5385	And let me make another observation.	0
ClaimBuster	5386	But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	5387	That's the decision of the next president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	5388	"Six months after he said Osama bin Laden must be caught dead or alive, this president was asked, ""Where is Osama bin Laden? """	1
ClaimBuster	5389	"What Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that if without precondition you sit down across the table from someone who has called Israel a ""stinking corpse,"" and wants to destroy that country and wipe it off the map, you legitimize those comments."	0
ClaimBuster	5390	One of the problems, I think, at the time of South Korea was the question of whether the United States would defend it if it were attacked.	0
ClaimBuster	5391	A lot of decent, honorable people felt as he did on the draft.	1
ClaimBuster	5392	Like you, I'm concerned about the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	5393	And in our country we have evolved to a point where we've put millions of innocent people in jail because you go to the poor neighborhoods and they've put bars on their windows and bars on their doors and put themselves in jail to protect the things that they acquired legitimately.	0
ClaimBuster	5394	Now, two-thirds of the people in this country who receive Social Security checks live entirely on that check; they have no other income.	1
ClaimBuster	5395	It's going to help jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	5396	Now I didn't make most of the statements that you said I made.	0
ClaimBuster	5397	So we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	5398	And I saw the cocaine scene treated with humor, as though this was a humorous little incident.	1
ClaimBuster	5399	The Democratic party in this century has stood for something.	0
ClaimBuster	5400	So I'm pledged to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	5401	They discover great new cures and that's great.	1
ClaimBuster	5402	Well it, after World War I, we had, you know, a policy of disengagement.	1
ClaimBuster	5403	You also have investments through a Cayman's trust.	1
ClaimBuster	5404	Our nation is involved in two wars, and we are going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	5405	No, but let me just stay to the American people in 2 and a half weeks we're going to choose who should sit in this Oval Office, who to lead the economic recovery, who to be the leader of the free world, who to get the deficit down.	1
ClaimBuster	5406	They hack into our computers.	1
ClaimBuster	5407	The criminal is not going to show up and say hey, give me my I.D.	0
ClaimBuster	5408	And it's the president's fiscal policies that have driven up the biggest deficits in American history.	1
ClaimBuster	5409	General Ridgway has said the same thing.	1
ClaimBuster	5410	But we've got to enforce the laws, which is what we are doing, and we've also got to make sure that in every walk of life we do not tolerate discrimination.	0
ClaimBuster	5411	That is a very strong incentive that we've given them to do the right thing.	0
ClaimBuster	5412	He and I used to have arguments about the war.	1
ClaimBuster	5413	It's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.	0
ClaimBuster	5414	Number three, we're going to have to have training programs that work for our workers and schools that finally put the parents and the teachers and the kids first, and the teachers' unions going to have to go behind.	0
ClaimBuster	5415	It's not in our national interest to use force in this case.	0
ClaimBuster	5416	Now let me come directly to your question.	0
ClaimBuster	5417	Well, you establish respect for differences.	0
ClaimBuster	5418	Look, we are sending $700 billion a year overseas to countries that don't like us very much.	1
ClaimBuster	5419	National security and human rights must go together.	0
ClaimBuster	5420	And if we do that, if we do what I'm planning on doing, which is getting us energy independent, North America energy independence within eight years, you're going to see manufacturing jobs come back.	0
ClaimBuster	5421	And never forget, they've got Airbus over there, and it's a government-owned, privately owned, consortium across Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	5422	At that time, nobody thought I had a chance to win.	0
ClaimBuster	5423	And so I don't know what the answer is.	0
ClaimBuster	5424	And inflation went down below the national average in California when we returned the money to the people and reduced Government spending.	1
ClaimBuster	5425	We tried to build a little ship called the Littoral Combat Ship that was supposed to cost $140 million, ended up costing $400 million, and we still haven't done it.	1
ClaimBuster	5426	We have a gentleman down in Nicaragua who is on contract to the CIA, advising -- supposedly on military tactics -- the contras.	1
ClaimBuster	5427	Now, that's not my analysis.	0
ClaimBuster	5428	Try and get a mortgage these days.	0
ClaimBuster	5429	We're also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip.	1
ClaimBuster	5430	I'll just give you one quick example.	0
ClaimBuster	5431	It could also be lots of other people.	0
ClaimBuster	5432	And I think that this is what we should concentrate on, is trying -- I know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee, there were medical authorities, there were religious -- there were clerics there -- everyone talking about this matter of prolife.	0
ClaimBuster	5433	You see all these ads?	0
ClaimBuster	5434	17 new taxes, price controls, 50 new bureaucracies.	1
ClaimBuster	5435	I work with Director Mueller of the FBI; comes in my office when I'm in Washington every morning, talking about how to protect us.	1
ClaimBuster	5436	Now there are three crimes for every policeman.	1
ClaimBuster	5437	And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.	0
ClaimBuster	5438	We need to have as well a strong military.	0
ClaimBuster	5439	If I ever decided to impose an embargo because of a crisis in international relationships, it would include all shipments of all equipment.	0
ClaimBuster	5440	I'm fighting for the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	5441	I mean, you've got to care.	0
ClaimBuster	5442	To the millions of fine decent people who did the unthinkable and took their country back in their own hands and put me on the ballot, let me pledge to you that tonight is just the beginning.	0
ClaimBuster	5443	And I've had conversations with him.	1
ClaimBuster	5444	But I just have to...	0
ClaimBuster	5445	And I am going to do it in a way that's fiscally sound.	0
ClaimBuster	5446	Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?	0
ClaimBuster	5447	If you have a child, you got tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	5448	I want to empower the people.	0
ClaimBuster	5449	Second, in the field of schools, we believe that there should be provisions whereby the federal government would give assistance to those districts who do want to integrate their schools.	0
ClaimBuster	5450	As a matter of fact, Mexico, itself, is one of our biggest agricultural customers, so in the sense that we can work to help Mexico rebuild and expand and deal with these very serious economic problems we help our farmers at the same time.	1
ClaimBuster	5451	It's one of the major priorities of my administration.	0
ClaimBuster	5452	This one concerned uh - Great Britain.	0
ClaimBuster	5453	Make sure that you are getting a good paying job, making sure that Medicare and Social Security... (CROSSTALK)	0
ClaimBuster	5454	What happened to the FBI, I don't know.	0
ClaimBuster	5455	Look at that horrible -- these are radical Islamic terrorists.	1
ClaimBuster	5456	At the present time we're spending roughly three billion five hundred million dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	5457	So I just left some high representatives of India.	1
ClaimBuster	5458	We all agreed it would be a pretty dull place.	0
ClaimBuster	5459	Most people are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	5460	We either have -- and by the way...	0
ClaimBuster	5461	Look, we can attack health care and energy at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	5462	"I went to a number of women's groups and said, ""Can you help us find folks,"" and they brought us whole binders full of women."	1
ClaimBuster	5463	That was a tragic mistake that we made, a mistake that Mr. Bush made and others made and it should never ever be made again.	0
ClaimBuster	5464	You've gone up 64 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	5465	It's gone up by $2,500 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	5466	And yes, I think it's something that people need to consider.	0
ClaimBuster	5467	Another example would be the Dred Scott case, which is where judges, years ago, said that the Constitution allowed slavery because of personal property rights.	1
ClaimBuster	5468	I would say the only way -- because those stories are all totally false, I have to say that.	0
ClaimBuster	5469	I don't believe we're going to go back to the Cold War.	0
ClaimBuster	5470	And that state we controlled spending.	1
ClaimBuster	5471	And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division.	1
ClaimBuster	5472	And I would say to the Soviet Union, we will sit and negotiate with you as long as it takes, to have not only legitimate arms limitation, but to have a reduction of these nuclear weapons to the point that neither one of us represents a threat to the other.	0
ClaimBuster	5473	I don't want to see the Federal Government licensing grandmothers.	0
ClaimBuster	5474	And only the US could do this.	0
ClaimBuster	5475	She said she thought nuclear weaponry - and the control of nuclear arms.	1
ClaimBuster	5476	82,000 Arizonians lost their health insurance under President Bush's watch.	1
ClaimBuster	5477	President Bush recently sent a senior ambassador, Bill Burns, to participate in talks with the Europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	5478	At the same time, regulation can become excessive.	0
ClaimBuster	5479	Sure we want family leave.	0
ClaimBuster	5480	He puts his money in the outyears, and even if he were re-elected, he'd be gone before anything would happen, and nothing is going to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	5481	Mr. President, if I heard you correctly, you said that these deficits don't have anything to do with interest rates.	1
ClaimBuster	5482	That's where he was breaking the agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	5483	Well, Mr. Ford doesn't seem to put into perspective the fact that when - when uh five hundred thousand more people are out of work than there were three months ago, while we have two and a half million more people out of work than were when he took office, that this touches human beings.	1
ClaimBuster	5484	So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	5485	And we've been in - on the whole, uninterested.	0
ClaimBuster	5486	They are now engaged in a debate over whether war is the means of Communizing the world or whether they should use subversion, infiltration, economic struggles and all the rest.	1
ClaimBuster	5487	... right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP.	1
ClaimBuster	5488	You bet I want to open up a small part of Alaska.	0
ClaimBuster	5489	I have a manufacturing jobs credit.	1
ClaimBuster	5490	Under my plan, if a school is failing, we work with the states to give them the authority and the resources to close down that school and reopen it right away with a new principal, a new faculty, a turn-around team of specialists who know what they're doing.	0
ClaimBuster	5491	And I think he made a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	5492	I believe that the free Iraq is in this nation's interests.	0
ClaimBuster	5493	It's about your family; it's about your business, and in this case it's about a firmer policy with Cuba.	0
ClaimBuster	5494	And we've gotten some real progress in the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	5495	This is a government that says younger workers can't possibly have their own assets.	0
ClaimBuster	5496	We cleaned up more brown fields than any other administration in my state's history, 450 of them.	1
ClaimBuster	5497	I don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent crime-ridden society in the industrialized world.	0
ClaimBuster	5498	But spending money without a strategic plan can oftentimes be wasted.	0
ClaimBuster	5499	I am going to stand by and use the moral persuasion of the US to get satisfaction in terms of prison camps, and we're making some progress there, and in terms of getting humanitarian relief in there.	1
ClaimBuster	5500	I notice that Governor Reagan recently mentioned the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	5501	Our hearts and -- and minds go out to them.	0
ClaimBuster	5502	So the choice for America is, you can have a plan that I've laid out in four points, each of which I can tell you more about or you can go to johnkerry.com and see more of it; or you have the president's plan, which is four words: more of the same.	0
ClaimBuster	5503	I wish you would have done this.	0
ClaimBuster	5504	And may God bless the US of America.	0
ClaimBuster	5505	You won't pay a fine, because...	0
ClaimBuster	5506	The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States?	0
ClaimBuster	5507	Who -- why would you want to increase anybody's taxes right now?	0
ClaimBuster	5508	Sometimes the United States has to act alone or at least has to act first.	0
ClaimBuster	5509	But I am not going to slam the door on women and children.	0
ClaimBuster	5510	Our water is cleaner now.	1
ClaimBuster	5511	I would rather not critique the 2 candidates.	0
ClaimBuster	5512	When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy.	0
ClaimBuster	5513	Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn't built.	0
ClaimBuster	5514	When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of.	1
ClaimBuster	5515	It's a lot more than $18 billion in pork-barrel spending.	1
ClaimBuster	5516	There is going to be the need for each and every one of us to start thinking about how we use energy.	0
ClaimBuster	5517	I came from very modest background.	1
ClaimBuster	5518	The World Bank I think is generally doing a better job, but I think one of the big issues here that doesn't get nearly enough attention is the issue of corruption.	0
ClaimBuster	5519	After all, it isn't paid for by my money, it isn't paid for by his, but by the people's money.	1
ClaimBuster	5520	People need to know that over the next ten years it is going to be $25 trillion of revenue that comes into our treasurey and we anticipate spending $21 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	5521	I want a great relationship with China.	0
ClaimBuster	5522	That's why I say again to all of you out there who have to deal with your household budgets and know how difficult it is that the next President has to do the same.	0
ClaimBuster	5523	The American people are moving again, and moving in the right direction.	0
ClaimBuster	5524	A little child before they're 18 months learns to think well of himself or herself or poorly.	1
ClaimBuster	5525	And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	5526	This is not the America that we've known in the past.	0
ClaimBuster	5527	Well, first of all, the president's figures of $2.2 trillion just aren't accurate.	1
ClaimBuster	5528	And now with this risky $550 billion tax scheme of Senator Dole's, even his own friends, his campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says that they can't possibly pay for it without cutting Medicare more and cutting Social Security as well, according to him.	1
ClaimBuster	5529	their Social Security tax payments by 50%.	1
ClaimBuster	5530	Now they have -- he has aligned with Russia and with Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	5531	I'm happy to have a longer conversation --	0
ClaimBuster	5532	And we -- we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	5533	And now we're going back to budgeting for additional lands for our parks.	0
ClaimBuster	5534	If we can get that across to the people of these countries, in this decade of the sixties, the struggle for freedom will be won.	0
ClaimBuster	5535	We have to change the culture of America.	0
ClaimBuster	5536	Take a look at upstate New York.	0
ClaimBuster	5537	We went from deficit to surplus.	1
ClaimBuster	5538	But it's locker room talk, and it's one of those things.	0
ClaimBuster	5539	But with regard to whether Mr. Mondale would be strong, as he said he would be, I know that he has a commercial out where he's appearing on the deck of the Nimitz and watching the F - 14's take off.	1
ClaimBuster	5540	And I don't assail him on that issue, or others on that issue.	0
ClaimBuster	5541	But let's look at it.	0
ClaimBuster	5542	The only thing consistent about my opponent's position is that he's been inconsistent.	0
ClaimBuster	5543	Could have a chance to serve as president.	0
ClaimBuster	5544	He's 10 years old now.	1
ClaimBuster	5545	Now let's just see what this means.	0
ClaimBuster	5546	I know what it's like to have your comrades reach out to you and your neighbors and your fellow citizens and pick you up and put you back in the fight.	0
ClaimBuster	5547	I'm not going to talk about a difference of character.	0
ClaimBuster	5548	That's something that all of us have to be involved with and that requires some leadership from Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	5549	You got a 265 billion dollar tax increase.	1
ClaimBuster	5550	My opponent says J. Danforth Quayle.	1
ClaimBuster	5551	And members of Senator Dole's own party in the Senate killed it.	1
ClaimBuster	5552	It's a $550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments, college loans, and small business loans.	1
ClaimBuster	5553	And secondly, we've had enough fighting.	1
ClaimBuster	5554	In '17, it implodes by itself.	1
ClaimBuster	5555	This economic package is about families but it's a six-point package.	1
ClaimBuster	5556	And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that they're setting up their training programs...	0
ClaimBuster	5557	We've got to have a - a firm way to handle the energy question.	0
ClaimBuster	5558	Well, let me just say that, with regard to that same missile system, I happen to support and believe in the missile, itself.	0
ClaimBuster	5559	And I don't want to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	5560	Just a fact clarification real quickly.	0
ClaimBuster	5561	This is one of your own advisers.	1
ClaimBuster	5562	It's time to bring folks together to say that all seniors will get prescription drug coverage.	0
ClaimBuster	5563	What we can do to help young women and women of all ages is to have a strong economy, so strong that employers that are looking to find good employees and bringing them into their workforce and adapting to a flexible work schedule that gives women opportunities that they would otherwise not be able to afford.	1
ClaimBuster	5564	We take program after program that we don't absolutely have to have, and we get rid of them.	0
ClaimBuster	5565	I do believe it's wrong to use a litmus test.	0
ClaimBuster	5566	I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say.	0
ClaimBuster	5567	Something that the vice presidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s running mate supports.	0
ClaimBuster	5568	I think good will on both parts, hard bargaining by both parties and a reasonable compromise will be in the best interests of all parties.	0
ClaimBuster	5569	I don't just talk about it.	0
ClaimBuster	5570	And I was embarrassed by it.	0
ClaimBuster	5571	We've uh - ignored or excluded the American people and the Congress from participation in the shaping of our foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	5572	And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	5573	And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has...	0
ClaimBuster	5574	Was -- Lorranna -- Lorraine -- we are a nation of immigrants.	0
ClaimBuster	5575	But we will have a very poor nation and a very unsound economy if we follow that path.	0
ClaimBuster	5576	We had a tire case in which they were flooding us with cheap domestic tires -- or -- or cheap Chinese tires.	1
ClaimBuster	5577	What I've also said is if we're going to go after folks who are here illegally, we should do it smartly and go after folks who are criminals, gang bangers, people who are hurting the community, not after students, not after folks who are here just because they're trying to figure out how to feed their families.	0
ClaimBuster	5578	I think it's going to be critically important for us to recruit a generation of new teachers, an army of new teachers, especially in math and science, give them higher pay, give them more professional development and support in exchange for higher standards and accountability.	0
ClaimBuster	5579	... reduce this -- I can -- we can do it with this kind of job creation of energy independence.	0
ClaimBuster	5580	You picked up a $500-billion bill because of the dumb way the federal government deregulated it.	1
ClaimBuster	5581	Because in industry today, we're producing more, over the last several years, and at 12% less use of energy than we were back in about 1973.	1
ClaimBuster	5582	Secondly, we've set up what's called the -- well, first of all, I agree with my opponent that the biggest threat facing this country is weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a terrorist network.	0
ClaimBuster	5583	I readily admit I'm not going to grow the size of the federal government like he is.	0
ClaimBuster	5584	Mr. Ford has shown an absence of leadership, and an absence of a grasp of what this country is and what it ought to be.	0
ClaimBuster	5585	And if we throw away that ability to serve as an honest broker, then we have thrown -- we will have thrown away a strategic asset that's important not only to us but also to Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	5586	So when I talk about how we're going to pay for education, how we're going to invest in infrastructure, how we're going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I've made it very clear we are going where the money is.	0
ClaimBuster	5587	We do need to make sure that they don't have arms that get into the -- the wrong hands.	0
ClaimBuster	5588	The electric decontrol bill that I fought for and signed in Texas has mandatory emission standards, Mr. Vice President.	1
ClaimBuster	5589	The present tax structure is a disgrace to this country; it's just a welfare program for the rich.	0
ClaimBuster	5590	I would never do anything that would increase the taxes for those who work for a living, or who are presently required to list all their income.	0
ClaimBuster	5591	These people are hurting in the inner cities.	0
ClaimBuster	5592	They had built covert facilities.	1
ClaimBuster	5593	Probably a lot of kids here disagree with me.	0
ClaimBuster	5594	Because if there's a two parent family, the prospect of living in poverty goes down dramatically.	1
ClaimBuster	5595	Do we remove dams that produce hydroelectric energy?	0
ClaimBuster	5596	On the 2nd debate, I offered, since both sides want the enterprise zones and we can't get together, I said I'll take a few days off and go to Washington and hold hands with you and we'll get it done.	1
ClaimBuster	5597	I vetoed a number of bills of that kind myself, when I was in California.	1
ClaimBuster	5598	I would appoint people that have a philosophy that I think would have it quite likely they would uphold Roe v. Wade.	0
ClaimBuster	5599	We can't simply stick our heads in the sands in terms of testing.	0
ClaimBuster	5600	It's going to help Jeremy get a job when he comes out of school.	0
ClaimBuster	5601	We've got chemical warfare being conducted against our children on the streets in this country all day every day, and we don't have the will to stamp it out.	0
ClaimBuster	5602	And you have to have cost controls, yes.	0
ClaimBuster	5603	Let her release the e-mails.	0
ClaimBuster	5604	I will have a unique mandate.	0
ClaimBuster	5605	If there's one thing Africa needs it's technical assistance.	0
ClaimBuster	5606	And I believe that if we can tap the tremendous untapped reservoir of innate strength in this country, that we can once again have a government as good as our people, and let the world know what we still know and hope for - that we still live in the greatest and the strongest and the best country on earth.	0
ClaimBuster	5607	And I think that the environmental benefits that come from sound management of the land ought to represent a new way for farmers to get some income that will enable them -- enable you to make sensible choices in crop rotation, and when you leave the land fallow and the rest.	0
ClaimBuster	5608	I'll give you one, that HMET, that heavy truck, that's cost what is it $850 million and the Pentagon didn't request it and, yet, a member of Congress, a very powerful one, put it in the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	5609	I don't believe I've used those words.	0
ClaimBuster	5610	That's where government should not be.	0
ClaimBuster	5611	First contact should be with the money when she's pregnant.	0
ClaimBuster	5612	We're going to do a lot of things for college tuition.	0
ClaimBuster	5613	I think it's a good decision--took a little heat for it, but I think it was the correct decision to do.	0
ClaimBuster	5614	I happened to favor the other piece of legislation and thought that it would be better for the senior citizens and provide better care than the one that was finally passed.	0
ClaimBuster	5615	Let's look at the reaction eh - reaction to Khrushchev and Eisenhower at the last U.N. session.	0
ClaimBuster	5616	It seems to me that a moment's reflection tells you why the United States Senate turned that amendment down, because it will undermine the practice of honest faith in our country by politicizing it.	0
ClaimBuster	5617	I opposed the grain embargo in my administration.	1
ClaimBuster	5618	I think you're right that the polls show that the majority of Hispanics want that bill, so I'm not doing it for political reasons.	1
ClaimBuster	5619	I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true.	0
ClaimBuster	5620	The President's favorite question is: Are you better off?	0
ClaimBuster	5621	I don't think we ought to be giving welfare payments to illegal immigrants.	0
ClaimBuster	5622	The fact is that he's cut job-training money.	1
ClaimBuster	5623	The tax burden on them has not gone down.	1
ClaimBuster	5624	We've created a mess, don't have much to show for it and we have got to fix it.	0
ClaimBuster	5625	(LAUGHTER) Just add up all the numbers.	0
ClaimBuster	5626	But, again, I want to return.	0
ClaimBuster	5627	As I said, we have made sure that millions of young people are able to get an education that they weren't able to get before.	1
ClaimBuster	5628	I have been a strong force for reform.	0
ClaimBuster	5629	Give me a chance to create these kind of jobs in America.	0
ClaimBuster	5630	That's what he's done when it comes to, for example, passing the landmark 1994 crime bill, the Violence Against Women's Act.	1
ClaimBuster	5631	the question, to sort of get a new military, get the best in the world, we got it, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re keeping the peace, and they're respected around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	5632	It was my very first bill, and I'm very proud of it because it symbolizes what I think we ought to be doing.	1
ClaimBuster	5633	We reduced the welfare rolls by 2 million already.	1
ClaimBuster	5634	The Natl Science Foundation did a study which said it would be difficult for us to reach fuel efficiency standards in excess of 37 miles per gallon by the year 2000.	1
ClaimBuster	5635	There are indications, because of new inventions, that ten, fifteen, or twenty nations will have a nuclear capacity - including Red China - by the end of the presidential office in 1964.	0
ClaimBuster	5636	We have to trust people to make decisions with their lives.	0
ClaimBuster	5637	Earmarks account for 0.5 percent of the total federal budget.	1
ClaimBuster	5638	Number one, I want to cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	5639	how well it could be done.	0
ClaimBuster	5640	Uhh - I believe also that uh - there is some merit to a - an amendment that uh - uh - Senator Everett Dirksen uh - proposed very frequently, an amendment that would uh - change the court decision as far as voluntary prayer in public schools.	0
ClaimBuster	5641	He is denigrating -- he's talking down our democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	5642	Well, the president's own CIA director says Saddam is stronger now than he was.	1
ClaimBuster	5643	We need to give the police a fighting chance in our urban areas where the gangs are building up.	0
ClaimBuster	5644	And uh - these projections have been very carefully made.	0
ClaimBuster	5645	I hope we can do it.	0
ClaimBuster	5646	He has learned the date of the expiration of SALT I, apparently.	1
ClaimBuster	5647	The big oil companies are against the measures to get more energy independence and renewable fuel.	1
ClaimBuster	5648	This is a town where the White House says, Congress did it; Congress says, the White House did it.	0
ClaimBuster	5649	The -- look, I think anybody out there can check the record.	0
ClaimBuster	5650	That of course was rejected as was the government contracts provision by the special session of the Congress to - in which Mr. Kennedy was quite active.	1
ClaimBuster	5651	Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	5652	I just don't believe that's the answer.	0
ClaimBuster	5653	They want these young people to have a chance to get jobs and the rest.	0
ClaimBuster	5654	That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.	1
ClaimBuster	5655	I'm going to ask the Congress for $2 billion to make sure we have the cleanest coal technologies in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	5656	"But what it does say is that ""insurers, you've got to take everybody."""	0
ClaimBuster	5657	We absolutely have to make more progress and that's why we're going to keep on pressing.	0
ClaimBuster	5658	And it's important, Jim, not only -- not just because of Texas, but because this mirrors the national controversy.	0
ClaimBuster	5659	I think we ought to do it by full enforcement of the catastrophic health insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	5660	But that progress is only the beginning.	0
ClaimBuster	5661	In the private sector, Governor Romney's company invested in what were called pioneers of outsourcing.	1
ClaimBuster	5662	Barry, I think a lot of this campaign, maybe over the last four years, has been devoted to this nation that I think government creates jobs, that that somehow is the answer.	0
ClaimBuster	5663	I think that the way to grow this economy is to keep taxes low, is have an energy plan, is to have litigation reform.	0
ClaimBuster	5664	When the action in Kosovo was dragging on and we were searching for a solution to the problem, our country had defeated the adversary on the battlefield without a single American life being lost in combat.	1
ClaimBuster	5665	That might be the explanation, if you tell me the program.	0
ClaimBuster	5666	I will let the American people decide that.	0
ClaimBuster	5667	My view is we want to find jobs and opportunities and education.	0
ClaimBuster	5668	We said you've got -- banks, you've got to raise your capital requirements.	1
ClaimBuster	5669	I said that our economic plan would produce eight million jobs, we have ten and a half million new jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	5670	We also need to provide an adequate supply of enriched uranium.	0
ClaimBuster	5671	Look at Lynn Martin, who's fighting against this glass ceiling and doing a first-class job on it.	1
ClaimBuster	5672	We came here loving this nation, serving it, and it has served all of our most bountiful dreams.	0
ClaimBuster	5673	I voted for border security in the United States Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	5674	In fact I said, is that the last jobs report before the election?	1
ClaimBuster	5675	We think that's very important because a lot of people take care of their parents.	1
ClaimBuster	5676	That has been reinforced by direct commitments of the president of the United States; it's been reinforced by a number of other nations under NATO.	1
ClaimBuster	5677	He didn't do any of those things.	0
ClaimBuster	5678	There's no doubt that we have achieved equal access to schools in America after a long and difficult and terrible struggle.	0
ClaimBuster	5679	Those are basic American values.	0
ClaimBuster	5680	This is an idea that's been around a long time, which is saying, hey, let's see if we can't get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality.	0
ClaimBuster	5681	Be strict and firm about it.	0
ClaimBuster	5682	Let's make sure that we're providing preventive care so we're catching the onset of something like diabetes.	0
ClaimBuster	5683	And she never will change.	0
ClaimBuster	5684	We're increasing the border security of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	5685	Here's the only problem: Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that you're getting from your employer.	1
ClaimBuster	5686	We have the most expensive health care system in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	5687	[Laughter] The fact of it is: The President's budget sought to cut Social Security by 25 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	5688	But that's only step one.	1
ClaimBuster	5689	And then, of course, the - the final thing is that I have signed and approved of more scenic rivers, more wilderness areas, since I've been president than any other president in the history of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	5690	I think human life is very, very precious.	0
ClaimBuster	5691	And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.	0
ClaimBuster	5692	I don't believe we should go to a summit conference unless we have such an agenda, unless we have some reasonable insur- assurance from Mr. Khrushchev that he intends seriously to negotiate on those points.	0
ClaimBuster	5693	Now, if you just want to get down to brass tacks, first thing you ought to do is get all these folks who've got these 1-way trade agreements that we've negotiated over the years and say fellas, we'll take the same deal we gave you.	1
ClaimBuster	5694	Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others.	1
ClaimBuster	5695	He had 16 other resolutions and nothing took place.	1
ClaimBuster	5696	They're from a fertility clinic.	1
ClaimBuster	5697	The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her.	0
ClaimBuster	5698	But I believe that this Agenda for American renewal I have is the answer to do it, and I believe we can get it done now, whereas we didn't in the past, because you're going to have a whole brand new bunch of people in the Congress that are going to have to listen to the same American people I'm listening to.	0
ClaimBuster	5699	General Shinsheki, the Army chief of staff, said you're going to need several hundred thousand troops.	1
ClaimBuster	5700	But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd- Frank, roll it back.	1
ClaimBuster	5701	But I want all the children -- I want these young people up here to be able to start with nothing but an idea like I did and build a business.	0
ClaimBuster	5702	They didn't volunteer the information.	1
ClaimBuster	5703	If you made 25,000 as the original proposal, you got your Social Security taxes increased.	1
ClaimBuster	5704	But as we look at the decisions that the next president of the United States is going to have to make, I just don't believe the place you go first is those programs, those so-called entitlements, which provide a basic floor of income and a modest amount of medical care for the elderly, the disabled, for people who can't make their way on their own, and in many cases, have given a great deal to this country.	0
ClaimBuster	5705	And it would be very difficult for me to answer that in any short period of time.	0
ClaimBuster	5706	If you're in your mid-40's under the governor's plan, Social Security will be bankrupt by the time you retire, if he takes it out of the Social Security Trust Fund.	1
ClaimBuster	5707	You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all.	1
ClaimBuster	5708	Let me say first of all, I'm all for students having more choices.	0
ClaimBuster	5709	He talks about middle-class tax cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	5710	People are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago, 2- 3rds of our people--a $1600 drop in average income in just the last 2 years.	1
ClaimBuster	5711	I hope we'll have a chance to get into that tonight, because I can get right to the center of the bull's-eye and tell you why we're losing whole industries in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	5712	But if you have a situation like that right in our backyard with chaos about to break out and flotillas forming to come across the water, and all kinds of violence there, right in one of our neighboring countries there, then I think that we did the right thing there.	0
ClaimBuster	5713	And they look at our country and they see what's going on.	0
ClaimBuster	5714	We had a great time.	0
ClaimBuster	5715	Number three, I'll make government more efficient and to cut back the number of employees, combine some agencies and departments.	0
ClaimBuster	5716	And what you're assuming is that that makes the recipient of the lobbying corrupt or the lobbyist himself corrupt.	0
ClaimBuster	5717	Now the next president of the United States in his first year is going to be confronted with a very serious question on our defense of Berlin, our commitment to Berlin.	0
ClaimBuster	5718	Appreciate the sacrifices their families make.	0
ClaimBuster	5719	One of the people who's here with me today met a woman in the airport saying her son, Jess was able to be present at the birth of her child because of the Family Leave Law.	1
ClaimBuster	5720	Number one, we've got to make sure that we've got oversight over this whole process; $700 billion, potentially, is a lot of money.	0
ClaimBuster	5721	I simply think it's wrong to take money away from programs that are helping build basic skills for kids, 90 percent of them are in the public schools; to take money away from programs that are helping fund the school lunch program, that are helping to fund the other programs, that are helping our schools to improve their standards.	1
ClaimBuster	5722	He spends more money for tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of his new spending proposals for health care, prescription drugs, education and national defense all combined.	1
ClaimBuster	5723	No, no, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.	0
ClaimBuster	5724	Where there are no failing schools, where the classrooms are small enough in size, number of students, so that the teacher can spend enough one-on-one time with each student.	0
ClaimBuster	5725	So these are the ways that you help families, you help youngsters to live better lives, and more decent lives.	0
ClaimBuster	5726	In partnership with the American Health Association...	0
ClaimBuster	5727	Why take it in the first place if you're going to give it back?	0
ClaimBuster	5728	If I think it's in our nation's strategic interest I'll commit troops.	0
ClaimBuster	5729	And one of the ways we're going to do it is, I'm going to work with my friend, John McCain, to further campaign finance reform so we get these incredible amounts of money out of the system and open it up to average people, so America is really represented by the people who make up America.	0
ClaimBuster	5730	You wonder, Nikki, why it is that people don't like us in some parts of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	5731	We are going to have to resort to van pooling, to car pooling.	0
ClaimBuster	5732	Will Guinea and Ghana, which have now voted with the Communists frequently as newly independent countries of Africa - will there be others?	1
ClaimBuster	5733	They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration.	1
ClaimBuster	5734	Now we're fighting again to get Mosul.	1
ClaimBuster	5735	In America no one will go without healthcare, no one will go without food.	0
ClaimBuster	5736	You know, I think his liberal vision is a thing of the past.	0
ClaimBuster	5737	And by that I want to have child care where the families, the parents, have control.	0
ClaimBuster	5738	On the other hand, women heads of household -- single women heads of household have -- for the first time there's been a turndown in the rate of poverty for them.	1
ClaimBuster	5739	We cut the cost - the increased cost of government - in half over the eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	5740	The economy is starting downhill with housing failure -- --	1
ClaimBuster	5741	"That's the extreme pro-abortion position, quote, ""health."""	0
ClaimBuster	5742	I have nothing but respect for the British, Tony Blair, and for what they've been willing to do.	0
ClaimBuster	5743	How can Barry Goldwater sitting in Arizona know whether I'm talking on the issues or not when we put out position paper after position paper, he puts out position paper after position paper; and we see this much about it, because everyone else is fascinated with polls and who's up or down today and who's going to be up or down tomorrow.	0
ClaimBuster	5744	We need to demand on results.	0
ClaimBuster	5745	It's like if you looked at the -- it's the equivalent of the buggy and horse days, compared to other industries here in America.	0
ClaimBuster	5746	Uh - Also, so that we can get the uh - opportunity for the questioners to question me, it will be before the next television debate.	0
ClaimBuster	5747	We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...	0
ClaimBuster	5748	It is a question of leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	5749	First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts.	0
ClaimBuster	5750	And it goes on and on.	0
ClaimBuster	5751	And that's one of the reasons why I believe I can get this job done, because I am determined for those soldiers and for those families, for those kids who put their lives on the line.	0
ClaimBuster	5752	The Byrd family may have a misunderstanding of it in Texas also.	0
ClaimBuster	5753	Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country, said, what's been the effect of Obamacare on your hiring plans?	1
ClaimBuster	5754	Do I think that I bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of our children still don't understand drugs are wrong, drugs can kill you.	0
ClaimBuster	5755	We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country.	1
ClaimBuster	5756	We must not be divided on this issue.	0
ClaimBuster	5757	Do you really think that 8 million Americans being out of work and the 50% unemployment among the youth of our country are acceptable?	1
ClaimBuster	5758	We have to have a streamlined NATO command structure.	0
ClaimBuster	5759	I have been for the taxpayer bill of rights all along.	1
ClaimBuster	5760	Because by far the vast majority of the help goes to people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.	1
ClaimBuster	5761	Our technicians have been working since that time in Geneva, trying to put into technical language a - an agreement that can be verified by both parties.	1
ClaimBuster	5762	It's what I look forward to doing and I know what it takes to make an economy work, and I know what a working economy looks like.	0
ClaimBuster	5763	Listen, the No Child Left Behind Act is really a jobs act when you think about it.	0
ClaimBuster	5764	I'm excited about our prospects as a nation.	0
ClaimBuster	5765	Obviously, we've poured billions of dollars into airport security.	1
ClaimBuster	5766	We're not going to spend billions on MX's on railroad cars, which is a weapons system we don't need, can't afford and won't help our defense posture at all.	1
ClaimBuster	5767	He didn't take that position on Budapest.	1
ClaimBuster	5768	The foreign policy of the United States meets the highest standards of morality.	0
ClaimBuster	5769	It will be determined to the extent that we represent the deepest ideals, the highest feelings and faith of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	5770	I have a long record of reform and fighting through on the floor of the United States Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	5771	You know, as governor, one of the things you have to deal with is catastrophe.	1
ClaimBuster	5772	We have a back-up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures.	1
ClaimBuster	5773	If they do give us a bona fide, complete uh - accounting of the eight hundred MIA's, then I believe that the United States should begin negotiations for the uh - admission of Vietnam to the United Nations.	0
ClaimBuster	5774	That's what I've tried to do and that's what I will continue to do as president.	0
ClaimBuster	5775	Third, I believe we should step up the use of our surplus foods in these areas until we're able to get the people back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	5776	In fact, it would be deflationary; it would cause great unemployment; it would cause a real slowdown in our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	5777	I think if you're going to have tax relief, everybody benefits.	0
ClaimBuster	5778	Candy, what Governor Romney said just isn't true.	0
ClaimBuster	5779	When I graduated from college, there were plenty of fancy ways to get out of going and being a part of that.	1
ClaimBuster	5780	We've got a good, common-sense policy.	0
ClaimBuster	5781	In any event, we saved the taxpayers $16 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	5782	And I wish Governor Bush would join me this evening in endorsing the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform Bill.	0
ClaimBuster	5783	There are seniors who pay more for their prescriptions than a lot of other people, more than their pets, sometimes.	1
ClaimBuster	5784	Small business is where jobs come from.	1
ClaimBuster	5785	In the last 21 months, more than 6 million people have gotten jobs -- there have been created new jobs for those people to where there are now 105 million civilians working, where there were only 99 million before; 107, if you count the military.	1
ClaimBuster	5786	Is it really the view of the American people, however you feel on the question of abortion, that government ought to be reaching into your livingrooms and making choices like this?	0
ClaimBuster	5787	I think the American people would appreciate that.	0
ClaimBuster	5788	The figures that the President has just used about California is a distortion of the situation there, because while I was Governor of California, our spending in California increased less per capita than the spending in Georgia while Mr. Carter was Governor of Georgia in the same four years.	1
ClaimBuster	5789	Now, here is how that connects with all the rest of what we've been talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	5790	We've increased money for ammunition and weapons and pay and homeland security.	1
ClaimBuster	5791	Under the governor's plan, if you kept the same fee for service that you have now under Medicare, your premiums would go up by between 18% and 47%, and that is the study of the Congressional plan that he's modeled his proposal on by the Medicare actuaries.	1
ClaimBuster	5792	But this administration time and time again has lost its way in this field.	0
ClaimBuster	5793	"And the answer is, ""Absolutely not."""	0
ClaimBuster	5794	The secretary already has the power to do that in the rescue package, but it hasn't been exercised yet.	1
ClaimBuster	5795	We needed to go to the U.N.	0
ClaimBuster	5796	We have to have modernization, especially if we achieve the 50 percent reduction in strategic weapons that our President is taking the leadership to attain.	1
ClaimBuster	5797	And that was before the war started.	1
ClaimBuster	5798	I have to pay the administration a compliment.	0
ClaimBuster	5799	But we have some work to do.	0
ClaimBuster	5800	That is the same old argument that's gotten us into trouble on the deficit side.	0
ClaimBuster	5801	So I think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force, and I will not, as president, in order to keep the American people safe.	0
ClaimBuster	5802	If we pull back in some isolation and say we don't have to do our share, or more than our share, anymore, I believe you are going to just ask for conflagration that we'll get involved in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	5803	Well, that's a great question.	0
ClaimBuster	5804	He says we have to move from one area of the world to another.	1
ClaimBuster	5805	So I hope that we can begin to move those resources.	0
ClaimBuster	5806	You know that home values of retirees continues to decline and people are no longer able to afford their mortgage payments.	1
ClaimBuster	5807	Now, how do we achieve it is the most critical component of it.	0
ClaimBuster	5808	Who's going -- the famous thing, we're going to answer our call at 3 o'clock in the morning.	0
ClaimBuster	5809	No, it was -- we put up the American flag.	1
ClaimBuster	5810	I'll make some news in the 3rd debate.	0
ClaimBuster	5811	We provided more money for daycare in the bill that passed the senate, was vetoed, then it came back and the president signed pretty much the same bill.	1
ClaimBuster	5812	I didn't win Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	5813	You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen.	1
ClaimBuster	5814	And so we're matching them up.	0
ClaimBuster	5815	I have fought to cut spending.	1
ClaimBuster	5816	Tom -- or John mentioned me being wildly liberal.	1
ClaimBuster	5817	And the American taxpayer ought to be glad they have a president to stand up to a spending Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	5818	Today it is up to about $38,000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	5819	The way we're going to create jobs here is not just to change our tax code, but also to double our exports.	0
ClaimBuster	5820	She had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go.	0
ClaimBuster	5821	I think that Senator Kennedy's policies and recommendations for the handling of the Castro regime are probably the most dangers- dangerously irresponsible recommendations that he's made during the course of this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	5822	And he has my full confidence and he'll have the confidence of people that are in their 30Ãâ‚¬s and 40Ãâ‚¬s and more.	0
ClaimBuster	5823	But this law can be used as leverage to get other countries to help us to move Cuba to democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	5824	So, there can be no concessions under any circumstances, because if we do it's an open invitation to others to do the same.	0
ClaimBuster	5825	I headed the task force when I was a member of the Congress way back in the late '60s on these kinds of things, on the Republican side.	1
ClaimBuster	5826	When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it's one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports.	1
ClaimBuster	5827	I don't believe it is fair to slap a 50-cent-a-gallon tax over whatever many years on the people that have to drive for a living, people that go long distances.	0
ClaimBuster	5828	So that is my answer to this question.	0
ClaimBuster	5829	And we just have a big disagreement about this.	0
ClaimBuster	5830	That's why I want another 4 years.	0
ClaimBuster	5831	You can decide which of us you think are right.	0
ClaimBuster	5832	It wasn't thought through properly.	0
ClaimBuster	5833	But here you cut the drug czar's office 83 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	5834	It would have eliminated the AmeriCorps plan and it would have cut back on student loans and scholarships.	1
ClaimBuster	5835	I agree with that, and that's why I was a principal sponsor of a liberal adoption law, so that more of these children could come to term, so that the young mothers were educated, so we found an option, an alternative.	1
ClaimBuster	5836	There are whole or this area there are whole blocks of land that are left bare, just bulldozed down flat.	1
ClaimBuster	5837	And -- as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released.	0
ClaimBuster	5838	We're going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s.	0
ClaimBuster	5839	No, it can become out of date.	0
ClaimBuster	5840	Those things deserve to be dealt with from day one.	0
ClaimBuster	5841	I would have brought our allies to our side.	0
ClaimBuster	5842	I believe we can all work together to make the individuals in the future have more and all of us working together can build a better America.	0
ClaimBuster	5843	But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma.	0
ClaimBuster	5844	That's why I'm going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history.	0
ClaimBuster	5845	I have opposed the president on spending, on climate change, on torture of prisoner, on - on Guantanamo Bay.	1
ClaimBuster	5846	Now in the case of Mr. Nixon, the reason the - the pardon was given, was that, when I took office this country was in a very, very divided condition.	1
ClaimBuster	5847	I met a lady in Colorado Springs about seven weeks ago now.	1
ClaimBuster	5848	Why pursue a strategy that would delegate to computers the question of starting a war?	0
ClaimBuster	5849	I have got a comprehensive strategy to not only chase down the Al Qaida, wherever it exists -- and we're making progress; three-quarters of Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justice -- but to make sure that countries that harbor terrorists are held to account.	1
ClaimBuster	5850	I grew up in the segregated South, thankfully raised by a grandfather with almost no formal education but with a heart of gold who taught me early that all people were equal in the eyes of God.	1
ClaimBuster	5851	And I respect the Second Amendment and I will not tamper with the Second Amendment.	1
ClaimBuster	5852	But that's the time when you're tested not only -- it's the time to test your mettle, a time to test your heart when you see people whose lives have been turned upside down.	0
ClaimBuster	5853	The first lady has done great work with an organization called Joining Forces putting our veterans back to work.	1
ClaimBuster	5854	We've got to do that in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	5855	These are sophisticated people watching tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	5856	And we're beginning with drug education and prevention beginning in the early elementary grades in every elementary school in our state, and that's the kind of effort we need in every elementary school in the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	5857	You will find that some of the worst school systems in America get the most money per student.	1
ClaimBuster	5858	You've got to understand that it is only the United States that can stand for freedom and democracy around the world and we can't turn it over to the United Nations or other multilateral organizations.	0
ClaimBuster	5859	I was going to say something...	0
ClaimBuster	5860	The amount of money that has to be raised in taxes for middle-class families to make up for completely eliminating that on the very wealthiest, the billionaires, that would be an extra heavy burden on middle-class families.	0
ClaimBuster	5861	I don't think any of us can say that our standing in the world now, the way children around the world look at the United States, is the same.	0
ClaimBuster	5862	Our people feel that we've lost something precious.	0
ClaimBuster	5863	That would break the auto industry and throw a lot of people out of work.	0
ClaimBuster	5864	And she always will be.	0
ClaimBuster	5865	I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted.	1
ClaimBuster	5866	They gave it a great deal of conscience and a great deal of work.	0
ClaimBuster	5867	When I was in the United States Senate I worked with former President Bush, your father.	1
ClaimBuster	5868	They're against the American way.	0
ClaimBuster	5869	I will accept and have accepted the recommendations of 2 proven leaders, General Colin Powell and Secretary Dick Cheney.	1
ClaimBuster	5870	And it's a strain on your family budget, but it's also bad for our national security, because countries like Russia and Venezuela and, you know, in some cases, countries like Iran, are benefiting from higher oil prices.	1
ClaimBuster	5871	That's how you gain legitimacy with your own countrypeople, and that's how you gain legitimacy in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	5872	Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground.	1
ClaimBuster	5873	So one more effort should be made.	0
ClaimBuster	5874	I propose more than twice as much because I think it's needed.	0
ClaimBuster	5875	When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it's in business and trade, where we're doing so badly.	1
ClaimBuster	5876	And that's how we're going to be more competitive, by making sure our kids are graduating from school and college.	0
ClaimBuster	5877	And I know how hard it is for that -- for an Army and a military to recover from that.	0
ClaimBuster	5878	It was not a spontaneous demonstration, is that what you're saying?	0
ClaimBuster	5879	The question before you comes down to this: Do you want to see America return to the policies of weakness of the last 4 years?	0
ClaimBuster	5880	Senator Dole just said we had the worst economy in the century.	1
ClaimBuster	5881	And I don't have any foreign money in my campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	5882	I think we've never had a situation so bad in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	5883	You just know you're reading a good judicial decision.	0
ClaimBuster	5884	And businesses did very well.	0
ClaimBuster	5885	And I'll bring new competition to bring the price down.	0
ClaimBuster	5886	While I was governor of Georgia, although I'm not a lawyer, we had complete reform of the Georgia court system.	1
ClaimBuster	5887	That is just a downpayment, in my opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	5888	That's because we believe in investing in education and in jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	5889	We've got to lead the world now to crack down on proliferation as a whole.	0
ClaimBuster	5890	So we have -- as we said, if you want to keep doing business and selling your products over here, you're going to have to quit pirating our CDs, and they agreed to do things and verify that they had done it, which will make the problem much better.	1
ClaimBuster	5891	That would be a time to seriously consider the use of force.	0
ClaimBuster	5892	The revenues exceed the expenses in Social Security until the year 2015 which means all retirees are going to get the promises made.	1
ClaimBuster	5893	And the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	5894	There are two distinguished authors on arms control in this country -- there are many others, but two that I want to cite tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	5895	So I talk about the corrupt media.	0
ClaimBuster	5896	And we're going to keep it out of the hands of terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	5897	It means making more progress in civil rights than we have so that we can be a splendid example for all the world to see - a democracy in action at its best.	0
ClaimBuster	5898	Just think in your own business, if you had all of your long term problems financed short term.	0
ClaimBuster	5899	So we're going to get a special prosecutor, and we're going to look into it, because you know what?	0
ClaimBuster	5900	I mean, that's been done.	1
ClaimBuster	5901	I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership.	0
ClaimBuster	5902	You put your thumb on a button and somebody blows up 20 minutes later.	0
ClaimBuster	5903	Where, then, do we disagree?	0
ClaimBuster	5904	That's why I'm such a strong believer in medical liability reform.	0
ClaimBuster	5905	And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	5906	Even in Iran they have had an election that began to bring about some change.	1
ClaimBuster	5907	Let's put it in perspective.	0
ClaimBuster	5908	And that law has died in committee also because of the same kind of opposition.	1
ClaimBuster	5909	I just described the coalition.	1
ClaimBuster	5910	Also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them.	0
ClaimBuster	5911	I served as governor and showed I could get them done.	1
ClaimBuster	5912	And people -- not everybody agrees with some of the decisions I've made.	0
ClaimBuster	5913	They had a cease-fire three weeks ago.	1
ClaimBuster	5914	We have freed other nations from dictators.	1
ClaimBuster	5915	I've met with a lot of them, and I've heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that's what I want to see.	1
ClaimBuster	5916	And it's not just because I worked with George W. Bush after 9/11, and I was very proud that when I told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said you've got it, and he never wavered.	1
ClaimBuster	5917	You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures.	1
ClaimBuster	5918	We live in a global economy, not a national economy.	0
ClaimBuster	5919	The Duelfer report confirmed that decision today, because what Saddam Hussein was doing was trying to get rid of sanctions so he could reconstitute a weapons program.	1
ClaimBuster	5920	North Korea quadrupled its nuclear capability.	1
ClaimBuster	5921	And I've made it very plain to them, we seek no superiority.	0
ClaimBuster	5922	I think the US has to still have the Statue of Liberty as a symbol, caring for others.	0
ClaimBuster	5923	They have stationed additional troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.	1
ClaimBuster	5924	The uh - right of indigent or very poor accused persons to uh - legal counsel.	0
ClaimBuster	5925	I also think we should have frankly restrictions on assault weapons whose only purpose is to kill.	0
ClaimBuster	5926	I have fought against it my career.	1
ClaimBuster	5927	But with regard to these high interest rates, too, at least give us the recognition of the fact that when you left office, Mr. Mondale, they were 211/2 -- the prime rate.	1
ClaimBuster	5928	But I do believe that with my record in Congress, having led the new Congressmen to a code of ethics through major main emphasis on it in full disclosure, that I've got a good record.	0
ClaimBuster	5929	But for us to be able to promote those principles of peace requires us to be strong.	0
ClaimBuster	5930	I believe on the record that this administration has been more responsive and we have carried out the law to the letter, and I'm proud of the record.	0
ClaimBuster	5931	During the years between World War I and World War II, a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	5932	Number one, we have an agreement where they notify us and we notify them of any uh - military maneuvers that are to be be undertaken.	1
ClaimBuster	5933	We'll continue to build strong coalitions.	0
ClaimBuster	5934	General Twining said they were still doing it in 1959.	1
ClaimBuster	5935	I'll be very proud to.	0
ClaimBuster	5936	They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration.	1
ClaimBuster	5937	The problem is we still have a archaic, 20th-century regulatory system for 21st-century financial markets.	1
ClaimBuster	5938	And what I want to do, is build on the five million jobs that we've created over the last 30 months in the private sector alone.	1
ClaimBuster	5939	When Mr. Nixon made his famous uh speech on Operation Independence we were importing about 35 percent of our oil.	1
ClaimBuster	5940	We've gotten the Americans for Disabilities Act, which I think is one of the foremost pieces of civil rights legislation.	0
ClaimBuster	5941	ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a long line of McCains that have served our country for a long time in war and in peace, it's been the great honor of my life, and I've been proud to serve.	1
ClaimBuster	5942	That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	5943	And likewise you've got more and more debt on your back.	0
ClaimBuster	5944	We won a majority, we didn't win the two-thirds that was necessary nor to pass that resolution, George.	1
ClaimBuster	5945	There are a good many able men who could be secretary of state.	0
ClaimBuster	5946	And, as a consequence, his consistent pattern throughout his career is to fight for the little guy.	0
ClaimBuster	5947	Now, the difference in our plans is I want that $2,000 to go to you, and the vice president would like to be spending the $2,000 on your behalf.	1
ClaimBuster	5948	So we have to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	5949	And the reason I've had to do that is that he ran on the left in the Democratic primary, ran firmly and ran with conviction and ran on his record.	1
ClaimBuster	5950	The president hasn't balanced a budget yet.	1
ClaimBuster	5951	Mr. Bush said once again I was going to have $150 billion tax increase.	1
ClaimBuster	5952	And I -- and I honestly don't believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas, including his initial reaction to Russian invasion -- aggression in Georgia, to his -- you know, we've seen this stubbornness before in this administration to cling to a belief that somehow the surge has not succeeded and failing to acknowledge that he was wrong about the surge is -- shows to me that we -- that -- that we need more flexibility in a president of the United States than that.	0
ClaimBuster	5953	So I don't intend to see it undone.	0
ClaimBuster	5954	"I decided I was dumb and didn't understand it so I called a ""Who's Who"" of the folks that have been around it, and I said why won't everybody go south; they said it will be disruptive; I said for how long."	0
ClaimBuster	5955	I want us to invest in you.	0
ClaimBuster	5956	NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	5957	So, for the viewers who are watching, I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan.	0
ClaimBuster	5958	They can't pay for their prescription drugs and so they're some of the ones that go to Canada regularly in order to get their prescription drugs.	1
ClaimBuster	5959	And what is important is making sure that we disagree without being disagreeable.	0
ClaimBuster	5960	That is the kind of thing we have to do, give people like you and our families the power to give those values to our children.	0
ClaimBuster	5961	And let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down, because as a chief executive that's balanced ten budgets in a row, I've had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices.	1
ClaimBuster	5962	They said, let us win.	1
ClaimBuster	5963	Pretty simple, folks -- if you're paying more and you don't have the best, if all else fails go copy the people who have the best who spend less, right?	0
ClaimBuster	5964	Tell me how it's affected you again.	0
ClaimBuster	5965	Neither of them have health insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	5966	I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania.	1
ClaimBuster	5967	And I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she's being who she was, she's being who she was born as.	1
ClaimBuster	5968	And if we could run our country the way I've run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of.	0
ClaimBuster	5969	This is an historic time.	0
ClaimBuster	5970	As I said before, Jim, there are going to be things that end up having to be ...	0
ClaimBuster	5971	We don't need a constitutional amendment for kids to pray, and what I did was to have the justice department and the education department for the first time ever issue a set of guidelines that we gave to every school in America, saying that children could not be interfered with in religious advocacy when they were praying, when they were doing whatever they could do under the constitution, just because they were on a public school ground, and I think anyone who's experienced this will tell you that our administration has done more than any in years to clarify the freedom of religion in the public square, including in the public schools.	1
ClaimBuster	5972	They talk, they don't get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	5973	In other words, I believe that doctors should not be able to be kicked out of managed care plans just because they tell the patients what they need and what more expensive care options might be.	0
ClaimBuster	5974	I think it needs to be moved out of the budget and protected.	0
ClaimBuster	5975	What I want to do is to send flexibility and authority to the local folks so you can choose what to do with the money.	0
ClaimBuster	5976	We'll honor our commitment to our seniors.	0
ClaimBuster	5977	It's been there for 20 years.	1
ClaimBuster	5978	It is a plan that will have 200 new programs -- expanded programs and creates 20,000 new bureaucrats.	1
ClaimBuster	5979	You bet we want to allow younger workers to take some of their own money.	0
ClaimBuster	5980	He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree.	0
ClaimBuster	5981	I oppose it because I want us to have more oil exploration and not less.	0
ClaimBuster	5982	Senator, no one's playing with your votes.	0
ClaimBuster	5983	Aren't you sick of being treated like an unprogrammed robot?	0
ClaimBuster	5984	It sort of brought home the transition to democracy that Russia was trying to make.	0
ClaimBuster	5985	Now, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication.	1
ClaimBuster	5986	We don't have a person to waste in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	5987	I don't believe that -- did we hear the size of the fine?	0
ClaimBuster	5988	Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system.	0
ClaimBuster	5989	I'm not sure what kind of view he's describing to me.	0
ClaimBuster	5990	Now, Senator McCain and I do agree, this is the greatest nation on earth.	0
ClaimBuster	5991	So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health.	0
ClaimBuster	5992	Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave.	0
ClaimBuster	5993	We're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism.	1
ClaimBuster	5994	But there's one last ingredient that I just want to mention, and that's parents.	0
ClaimBuster	5995	The embryo had already been destroyed prior to my decision.	1
ClaimBuster	5996	Well, could I just finish -- I think I...	0
ClaimBuster	5997	A lot of initials from a guy who's not from Washington, isn't it?	0
ClaimBuster	5998	And the compounding rate of interest effect will make it more likely that the Social Security system is solvent for our children and our grandchildren.	0
ClaimBuster	5999	And Prime Minister Koizumi is going to call countries to account, to get them to contribute.	0
ClaimBuster	6000	I'd go crazy sitting up there slow dancing that one.	0
ClaimBuster	6001	I appreciate his efforts and I wish him well.	0
ClaimBuster	6002	... and reduce our violence.	0
ClaimBuster	6003	We've done that by executive order.	1
ClaimBuster	6004	But your rate comes down and the burden also comes down on you for one more reason, and that is every middle-income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends or capital gains.	1
ClaimBuster	6005	So I think the appeal is yes, we care.	0
ClaimBuster	6006	But if everyone here in this audience was dead on in the middle of the middle-class, then the tax cuts for every single one of you all added up would be less than the tax cut his plan would give to just one member of that top wealthiest 1%.	1
ClaimBuster	6007	And you don't care about anything but making money.	0
ClaimBuster	6008	Mine is I want to empower people in their own lives.	0
ClaimBuster	6009	Well, first of all, Bob, thank you for moderating tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	6010	But let me -- let me come back -- we can come back.	0
ClaimBuster	6011	I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here even though sometime back they may have entered illegally.	0
ClaimBuster	6012	I think we're going to have to work to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	6013	And that's why I think it's important for the president to set a tone that says all of us are going to contribute, all of us are going to make sacrifices, and it means that, yes, we may have to cut some spending, although I disagree with Senator McCain about an across-the- board freeze.	0
ClaimBuster	6014	Well, let me just correct something very quickly.	0
ClaimBuster	6015	You don't tell countries you're going to unilaterally renegotiate agreements with them.	0
ClaimBuster	6016	You get a plan that will include prescription drugs, a plan that will give you options.	0
ClaimBuster	6017	One percent of America got $89 billion last year in a tax cut, but people working hard, playing by the rules, trying to take care of their kids, family values, that we're supposed to value so much in America -- I'm tired of politicians who talk about family values and don't value families.	1
ClaimBuster	6018	The difference is I want to bring it to 100% and he wants to bring it to 5%.	0
ClaimBuster	6019	And you pull all of it at once and read it and I did, and it's pretty clear what she and Kelly and the other key guys around that thing thought they were doing.	0
ClaimBuster	6020	And China's a got a lot of influence over North Korea, some ways more than we do.	1
ClaimBuster	6021	It presents a threat not only to our friends but ultimately a threat to us to have Iran have nuclear material, nuclear weapons that could be used against us or used to be threatening to us.	0
ClaimBuster	6022	Another very important - uh aspect of our - uh economy would be to increase production in every way possible, uh to hold down - uh taxes on individuals, and to uh shift the tax burdens onto those who have avoided paying taxes in the past.	0
ClaimBuster	6023	It was a horrible situation, no one liked to see it on our TV screens, but it's a case where we need to make sure we have an early warning system in place in places where there could be ethnic cleansing and genocide the way we saw it there in Rwanda.	1
ClaimBuster	6024	I would make sure that key members of Congress were called in to discuss the gravity of the situation.	0
ClaimBuster	6025	The three priorities were health...	0
ClaimBuster	6026	People who want to build on their dreams and make sure their kids have an even bigger dreams than they have.	0
ClaimBuster	6027	Under President Bush, the middle class has seen their tax burden go up and the wealthiest's tax burden has gone down.	1
ClaimBuster	6028	They're coming here to work.	0
ClaimBuster	6029	This man has outspent me and the special interests are outspending me.	1
ClaimBuster	6030	At one of the recent economic summit conferences between myself and the other leaders of the western world, we committed ourselves to take strong action against terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	6031	There may be testing in outer space.	0
ClaimBuster	6032	As a matter of fact, uh - 25 percent of the total tax deductions, go for only 1 percent of the richest people in this country, and over 50 percent of the tax uh credits go for the 14 percent of the richest people in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	6033	I also would like to point out that Republican presidents in those years, faced with a Democratic majority in both houses of the Congress, found that their requests for defense budgets were very often cut.	1
ClaimBuster	6034	And our military, we've got to strengthen our military long-term.	0
ClaimBuster	6035	There is a crime bill which would put more police on the street, which was killed for this session by a filibuster in the Senate, mostly be Republican senators, and I think it's a shame it didn't pass, I think it should be made the law -- but it had the Brady bill in it, the waiting period.	1
ClaimBuster	6036	And the only way to do it is to pass strong legislation so that once apprehended, indicted, convicted, they'll be in jail and off the streets and not using guns in the commission of a crime.	0
ClaimBuster	6037	To stand up straight and not scowl.	0
ClaimBuster	6038	I don't think that is in our interest, and I don't think that would be smart to do.	0
ClaimBuster	6039	We've got to create the products of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	6040	You can't tell me that any one who uses beans instead of meat in the United States - and there are twenty-five million of them according to Mr. Benson - is well fed or adequately fed.	1
ClaimBuster	6041	Now I'm very surprised that Senator Kennedy, who is on the Foreign Relations Committee, would have made such a statement as this kind.	0
ClaimBuster	6042	I think you've got to look at how one has handled responsibility in office.	0
ClaimBuster	6043	I believe strongly we should do so in Berlin.	0
ClaimBuster	6044	Bernard, this was the first presidential decision that we as nominees were called upon to make.	1
ClaimBuster	6045	He hasn't even made a proposal on either one.	1
ClaimBuster	6046	25th of December, Mr. Vice President.	0
ClaimBuster	6047	Now, Mr. Herter in 1958, when he was Under Secretary of State, said they were strategically undefensible.	1
ClaimBuster	6048	She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code.	1
ClaimBuster	6049	Now that's up to 40%.	1
ClaimBuster	6050	I would never normalize relationships with Vietnam, nor permit them to join the United Nations until they've taken this action.	0
ClaimBuster	6051	He wants your kids to pay for it.	0
ClaimBuster	6052	The program that was put forward this summer, after we broke off the sugar quota with Cuba, really was done because we wanted to get through the O.A.S.	1
ClaimBuster	6053	The banking system in this country is fundamentally sound with some weak banks.	1
ClaimBuster	6054	It would be rather difficult to cover them in eight and- in two and a half minutes.	0
ClaimBuster	6055	Since the depths of the recession, we have added four million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	6056	The horse is up here now.	1
ClaimBuster	6057	Let me just tell you...	0
ClaimBuster	6058	But -- but the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case.	0
ClaimBuster	6059	Our Guard and reserves have been turned into almost active duty.	1
ClaimBuster	6060	So we have to be intelligent in the way we go about it.	0
ClaimBuster	6061	It's not the right thing to do.	0
ClaimBuster	6062	That, I don't think, is the kind of change that we need.	0
ClaimBuster	6063	You'll have a shot at me in 4 years and you can vote me right out if you think I've done a lousy job and I would welcome you to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	6064	We are going to make America strong again, and we are going to make America great again, and it has to start now.	0
ClaimBuster	6065	We've had free and fair elections.	1
ClaimBuster	6066	It is not and I just described it...	0
ClaimBuster	6067	We've now reduced the importing of foreign oil in the last year alone by one-third.	1
ClaimBuster	6068	But that doesn't mean it wasn't a mistake of judgment to go there and take the focus off of Osama bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	6069	But the fact is, America is the greatest force for good in the history of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	6070	You know, he started off with his dad as a millionaire...	1
ClaimBuster	6071	I can't handle that in a minute, but I hope we can get back into it later.	0
ClaimBuster	6072	It underscores what I had to say in the Hartford debate, that there is really no foreign policy in this administration.	0
ClaimBuster	6073	But I think we're all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools.	0
ClaimBuster	6074	First of all, I'd like to thank the League of Women Voters for making this debate possible.	0
ClaimBuster	6075	possibility for oil of the continental shelf around the United States; when you stop to think that the government has taken over 100 million acres of land out of circulation in Alaska, alone, that is believed by geologists to contain much in the line of minerals and energy sources, then I think it is the Government, and the Government with its own restrictions and regulations, that is creating the energy crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	6076	What I want to find, if I am privileged to have the opportunity to do it -- and the Supreme Court of the United States is at stake in this race, ladies and gentlemen.	0
ClaimBuster	6077	No, there wasn't check out a sex tape.	1
ClaimBuster	6078	It gives you the choice.	0
ClaimBuster	6079	And the decisions we make will have enormous practical consequences.	0
ClaimBuster	6080	I want to help young people have an education, just as I had an education after World War II with the GI bill of Rights.	1
ClaimBuster	6081	Where our natural resources development - which I also support, incidentally, however - whenever you uh - uh - in - in - uh - appropriates money for one of these projects, you have to pay now and appropriate the money and the eh- while they eventually do pay out, it doesn't mean that you - the government doesn't have to put out the money this year.	0
ClaimBuster	6082	We need a president who can go in - who derives his strength from the people.	0
ClaimBuster	6083	The Freedom Support Act is something I got through the Congress, and it's a very good thing, because it does exactly what you say, and I think you agree with that, to help Russian democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	6084	I'm opposed to that, too.	0
ClaimBuster	6085	And I ask you for the privilege of leading our nation to be stronger at home and respected again in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	6086	It has a population less than Chicago or Los Angeles, about the size of Dallas and Forth Worth combined.	1
ClaimBuster	6087	We collect 35 cents, and we don't have it to spend.	1
ClaimBuster	6088	This is a mischaracterization of my position.	0
ClaimBuster	6089	I have proposed a managed competition plan for health care.	1
ClaimBuster	6090	The president can't order Congress around.	0
ClaimBuster	6091	This is uh - something, though, that I think uh - is indicative of the need among the American people to know how its commander-in-chief, the president, feels and - and - and I think the only criticism that I would have uh - on - of Mr. Ford is that uh - immediately when the statement was re - re - revealed, uh - perhaps a - a statement from the president would have been a clarifying and a very beneficial thing.	0
ClaimBuster	6092	And I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you've never seen.	1
ClaimBuster	6093	We've stopped that practice now by measuring early.	1
ClaimBuster	6094	Now, let's balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	6095	Now, I want to build on that.	0
ClaimBuster	6096	There are 357, 000 good jobs -- manufacturing jobs, which are lost.	1
ClaimBuster	6097	He doesn't adequately fund it.	0
ClaimBuster	6098	Nor was I misleading on the day that the president decided to go to war when I said that he had made a mistake in not building strong alliances and that I would have preferred that he did more diplomacy.	1
ClaimBuster	6099	You've said publicly that it's now three times the rate of inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	6100	And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy.	0
ClaimBuster	6101	I'll talk about that a little bit later, but the changes are mind-boggling for world peace.	0
ClaimBuster	6102	I want to make sure our timekeepers are working here.	0
ClaimBuster	6103	And I had 5 small children, and my family and I decided we would stay the course, and we lived with that problem for 3 years.	1
ClaimBuster	6104	I think that this is uh - an instance of uh - deliberate distortion, and this has occurred also in the question about defense.	0
ClaimBuster	6105	I'll sit down with them, Democrats and Republicans alike, and work for my agenda for American renewal, which represents real change.	0
ClaimBuster	6106	I haven't given lots of thought to NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	6107	They know it better than anybody.	0
ClaimBuster	6108	But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.	0
ClaimBuster	6109	All right, the war's over; we know he's dropping mustard gas on his own people, we know he's threatened to incinerate half of Israel.	1
ClaimBuster	6110	We find four times as many projects undertaken and completed in this Administration than in the previous one.	1
ClaimBuster	6111	Governor Romney, you did not...	0
ClaimBuster	6112	So we have put all chips in, right there, and nobody is talking about losing this war.	1
ClaimBuster	6113	I've been speaking out since day 1.	1
ClaimBuster	6114	I agree, we shouldn't have quotas.	0
ClaimBuster	6115	Why wouldn't we want to eliminate that?	0
ClaimBuster	6116	And, number three, we've got to deal with education so that our young people are competitive in a global economy.	0
ClaimBuster	6117	Some of the hardest moments since I've been the governor of the State of Texas is to deal with those cases.	0
ClaimBuster	6118	They just passed an electoral...	1
ClaimBuster	6119	And when Iraq if free, America will be more secure.	0
ClaimBuster	6120	The kids of those that came here illegally, those kids, I think, should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the United States and military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident.	0
ClaimBuster	6121	That is just factually incorrect.	1
ClaimBuster	6122	... if you'll let me, Bob, just about education...	0
ClaimBuster	6123	Here's the record: We cut deficit four years in a row for the first time before the Civil War -- I mean, before World War II, and maybe before the Civil War, too.	1
ClaimBuster	6124	Now, it is a sin if you're taking a human life.	0
ClaimBuster	6125	And we've had great success at revenue enforcement.	0
ClaimBuster	6126	And Donald never tells you what he would do.	0
ClaimBuster	6127	You don't even know who the rebels are.	0
ClaimBuster	6128	First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is.	0
ClaimBuster	6129	There is nothing more prejudiced than not educating a child.	0
ClaimBuster	6130	And as for this idea of nation building, the phrase sounds grandiose.	0
ClaimBuster	6131	Therein is the best answer to her.	0
ClaimBuster	6132	I think you'll find the difference reflected in our budgets.	0
ClaimBuster	6133	That's what elections are all about.	0
ClaimBuster	6134	If we cannot succeed, then we must strengthen ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	6135	And I agree with a lot of the other things that the governor has said.	0
ClaimBuster	6136	I want to make America great again.	0
ClaimBuster	6137	I mentioned 31/2 million women, more now in poverty than four years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	6138	We have, as I said, cut the taxes, but we have reduced inflation, and for 2 years now it has stayed down there, not at double digit, but in the range of 4 or below.	1
ClaimBuster	6139	Those are the questions we need answered.	0
ClaimBuster	6140	So I reject the idea that I don't believe in great teachers or more teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	6141	I believe that your health care is just as important as any politician in Washington, D. C.	0
ClaimBuster	6142	It would change the basic tone and commitment that our nation has experienced ever since the Second World War, with al Presidents, Democratic and Republican.	0
ClaimBuster	6143	Well, actually it's -- it's -- it's a lengthy description.	1
ClaimBuster	6144	I noticed that Governor Reagan said that when he was a young man that there was no knowledge of a racial problem in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	6145	This is the kind of change that would be made.	0
ClaimBuster	6146	His opponent, Kostunica, has won the election.	1
ClaimBuster	6147	And, you know, one of the biggest problems we have with China is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets.	1
ClaimBuster	6148	Ah, well, now you've added a hypothetical there at the end, Mr. Kalb, about where we would send troops in to fight.	0
ClaimBuster	6149	It's very hard to get other countries to give up their weapons when you're busy developing a new one.	0
ClaimBuster	6150	He pushed them away time and again, pushed them away at the U.N., pushed them away individually.	1
ClaimBuster	6151	Number 3, on the pension funds, I don't know as much about it, but I will say this.	0
ClaimBuster	6152	So this is, that's a good start.	0
ClaimBuster	6153	And I believe our troops need other allies helping.	0
ClaimBuster	6154	He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan.	1
ClaimBuster	6155	There's never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.	0
ClaimBuster	6156	Everybody would have been forced into managed care.	0
ClaimBuster	6157	If we raise the minimum wage, which I will do over several years to $7 an hour, 9.2 million women who are trying to raise their families would earn another $3,800 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	6158	Now, you asked what mistakes.	0
ClaimBuster	6159	It doesn't seem to me that it's needed or necessary to have legislation in this particular regard.	0
ClaimBuster	6160	And I made a good selection.	0
ClaimBuster	6161	And he has a record of weakness with regard to our national defense that is second to none.	0
ClaimBuster	6162	Four years later he is now promising another plan.	1
ClaimBuster	6163	They're making some progress; they need to make more.	0
ClaimBuster	6164	I want to be the one to banish chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth.	0
ClaimBuster	6165	Doesn't make me popular with environmentalists.	0
ClaimBuster	6166	Virtually every economic analysis that I've heard of, including the distinguished Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by, I think, almost everyone, says that even with historically high levels of economic growth, we will suffer a $263 billion deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	6167	But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing.	0
ClaimBuster	6168	Then you have the military and then you have the civilian government.	0
ClaimBuster	6169	Doesn't work any better through the private insurers.	0
ClaimBuster	6170	It's so heavy they'd give you a broken back.	0
ClaimBuster	6171	It shows a lack of leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	6172	And he was not out there urging them to vote for the McCain-Feingold bill.	1
ClaimBuster	6173	If he or representatives of the administration are either with or involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy, or don't pursue that connection in a way that makes it possible for us to cut it off and to be an example to our kids all over the country.	0
ClaimBuster	6174	So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald's not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies...	1
ClaimBuster	6175	Same thing with oil, same thing with natural gas.	1
ClaimBuster	6176	I don't think I need any on-the-job training.	0
ClaimBuster	6177	So he can throw all the kinds of numbers around.	0
ClaimBuster	6178	The President told you in '92 he would cut it 67 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	6179	But you were not an effective senator.	0
ClaimBuster	6180	We're even shipping 3,000 Kurds to Guam.	1
ClaimBuster	6181	Why aren't the NATO questioned -- why aren't they paying?	0
ClaimBuster	6182	I think that to do everything we can to find, as I say, something that would destroy weapons and not humans is a great step forward in human rights.	0
ClaimBuster	6183	In order to defend ourselves, we'd have to get international approval.	0
ClaimBuster	6184	She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter's wedding, number one, and a yoga class.	1
ClaimBuster	6185	... of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	6186	So you add it up.	0
ClaimBuster	6187	This is what we have to do.	0
ClaimBuster	6188	As a matter of fact, we're importing today about one-third less oil from overseas than we did just a year ago.	1
ClaimBuster	6189	I do not say that I have made the decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	6190	"But even after we gave in and said, ""All right, let's discuss it all,'' they walked away from the table."	1
ClaimBuster	6191	As Governor of California, I took charge of passing the strictest air pollution laws in the United States - the strictest air quality law that has even been adopted in the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	6192	A President has to lead his government or it won't be done.	0
ClaimBuster	6193	I want a nation of fairness, where no one is denied the fullness of life or discriminated against, and we deal compassionately with those in our midst who are in trouble.	0
ClaimBuster	6194	According to his own numbers.	0
ClaimBuster	6195	We're funding them ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ I wish there was more money -- but we're funding them far more than any time in the past, and we're going to keep on doing that.	1
ClaimBuster	6196	And we need that $10 billion a month here in the United States to put people back to work, to do all these wonderful things that Senator McCain suggested we should be doing, but has not yet explained how he would pay for.	1
ClaimBuster	6197	Well, now, I have to start with a smile, since his kind words to me.	0
ClaimBuster	6198	Secondly, we've added a million more children to the ranks of the insured through the Medicaid program.	1
ClaimBuster	6199	And we've got a strong family.	0
ClaimBuster	6200	She got it from the United States Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	6201	You'll never balance the budget by raising taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	6202	They don't enforce these kinds of things.	0
ClaimBuster	6203	But she is raising everybody's taxes massively.	1
ClaimBuster	6204	That's the war against terror.	0
ClaimBuster	6205	They raised the same thing with me on the Pledge of Allegiance.	1
ClaimBuster	6206	We've got to open up the possibilities of this research.	0
ClaimBuster	6207	I think that's a good investment.	0
ClaimBuster	6208	Why would they be saying -- they're not staying there anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	6209	Cutting our education budget, that's not a smart choice.	0
ClaimBuster	6210	And that's why I've tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president.	0
ClaimBuster	6211	Just go to her website.	0
ClaimBuster	6212	We've got to eliminate programs that don't work, and we've got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less.	0
ClaimBuster	6213	They would establish a base in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	6214	They're the ones who have the challenges and they are people out there making predictions that it's not going to be the same.	0
ClaimBuster	6215	So merit selection of judges is the most important single criterion.	0
ClaimBuster	6216	And so we've got to prioritize both our spending side and our tax policies to make sure that they're working for you.	0
ClaimBuster	6217	And Senator Fulbright, Senator Humphrey and I tried to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	6218	I've uh - been one who's loved my nation as many Americans do, and I believe that there's no limit placed on what we can be in the future, if we can harness the tremendous resources - militarily, economically, and the stature of our people, the meaning of the Constitution, in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	6219	Again, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve supported the President on Bosnia, and I think we were told the troops would be out in a year.	1
ClaimBuster	6220	First of all, I don't have a $5 trillion tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	6221	Now last week I guess it was Donna Shalala said well we'll cut Medicare a hundred billion and appoint a commission.	1
ClaimBuster	6222	He's a very fine research, top doctor, at the National Institute of Health, working hard doing something about research on this disease of AIDS.	1
ClaimBuster	6223	I would very much like to get our troops out of there.	0
ClaimBuster	6224	At the same time, however, I have not believed that prayer should be introduced into an election or be a part of a political campaign -- or religion a part of that campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	6225	But as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together.	0
ClaimBuster	6226	I see it all the time when people come up to me and say, I don't want you to let me down again.	0
ClaimBuster	6227	I think that's what leadership is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	6228	They have not done it.	1
ClaimBuster	6229	Well, with regard to this being a personal choice, isn't that what a murderer is insisting on, his or her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that?	0
ClaimBuster	6230	Why do you spend a billion dollars on something you think is a fantasy and a fraud?	0
ClaimBuster	6231	Secretary of State Kissinger has done a superb job in working with the black African nations, the so-called front-line nations.	1
ClaimBuster	6232	And, you know, Governor Romney, I'm glad that you agree that we have been successful in going after Al Qaida, but I have to tell you that, you know, your strategy previously has been one that has been all over the map and is not designed to keep Americans safe or to build on the opportunities that exist in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	6233	Much, much less, but at least we fixed it for some time and 37 to 40 million people get their checks on time.	1
ClaimBuster	6234	We've got to continue everything we can at the federal and the local level.	0
ClaimBuster	6235	It's still the most respected credit.	0
ClaimBuster	6236	That's where I get my name.	1
ClaimBuster	6237	Now the reason they don't have, The reason the President can't support this is pretty obvious.	0
ClaimBuster	6238	The goal here is to take back Mosul.	0
ClaimBuster	6239	And so, the whole matter of what to do with Social Security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation, and it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century.	1
ClaimBuster	6240	And they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like Syria.	1
ClaimBuster	6241	Giving them access to higher education.	1
ClaimBuster	6242	And the only poll I've ever followed is the one that uh - you know, is taken on election day.	0
ClaimBuster	6243	I agree with that, and I did support that law.	1
ClaimBuster	6244	And until we can begin to recreate the basic infrastructure of the great cities of America, particularly in the upper Midwest and in the Northeast, they simply are not going to provide the kind of economic climate that will enable them to retain industry, enable them to retain the kind of solid industrial base that they need, so that they can provide jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	6245	Senator Kennedy has suggested that he believes he knows the way.	1
ClaimBuster	6246	The second fact is that the housing unit for senior citizens that the President dedicated in Buffalo was only made possible through a Federal assistance program for senior citizens that the President's budget sought to terminate.	1
ClaimBuster	6247	You may want to focus on scandal.	0
ClaimBuster	6248	I felt very strongly about it, and I didn't want to go at the time.	0
ClaimBuster	6249	So when Senator McCain proposes a $300 billion tax cut, a continuation not only of the Bush tax cuts, but an additional $200 billion that he's going to give to big corporations, including big oil companies, $4 billion worth, that's money out of the system.	1
ClaimBuster	6250	Well, I fundamentally disagree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	6251	You resisted the appointment of a drug czar there because you thought it might interfere with treatment.	1
ClaimBuster	6252	And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror.	1
ClaimBuster	6253	Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it.	0
ClaimBuster	6254	I've done that with moderation, with care, with thoughtfulness; sometimes consulting experts.	0
ClaimBuster	6255	It's very simple for him to clear it up.	0
ClaimBuster	6256	Well, Martha, first, let me say -- and I've said before, but I'll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it -- that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account.	1
ClaimBuster	6257	But with tax incentives for the low-income groups we could build up their uh - income levels uh - above the poverty level and not uh make welfare more uh - profitable than - than work.	0
ClaimBuster	6258	It's not improving our health care system.	0
ClaimBuster	6259	I would like to see their elimination.	0
ClaimBuster	6260	I think that speaks for itself.	0
ClaimBuster	6261	Now, I have a little time left so let me just say that I get attacked so many times on these questions; it's hard to answer these things.	0
ClaimBuster	6262	A difference between big exploding federal government that wants to think on your behalf and a plan that meets priorities and liberates working people to be able to make decisions on your own.	0
ClaimBuster	6263	I saw a high school that is military.	1
ClaimBuster	6264	I had a discussion with my daughter, Amy, the other day, before I came here, to ask her what the most important issue was.	1
ClaimBuster	6265	We're doing everything we can to protect our borders and ports.	0
ClaimBuster	6266	But the top 1% will end up paying one-third of the taxes in America and they get one-fifth of the benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	6267	This one's kind of old.	1
ClaimBuster	6268	Well, Jim, under my plan all seniors will get prescription drugs under Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	6269	And I've done my best tonight to lay out my plans for going forward to an even better future in the next century.	0
ClaimBuster	6270	I think it's a responsibility, in this respect, in that we should have available and affordable health care to every American citizen, to every family member.	0
ClaimBuster	6271	... the fact is, he's going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we've ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration.	1
ClaimBuster	6272	"""Fortunately, she didn't hold me to that deal."	0
ClaimBuster	6273	And that's why I support that.	0
ClaimBuster	6274	I believe we should not go to the summit until there is some reason to believe that a meeting of minds can be obtained on either Berlin, outer space, or general disarmament - including nuclear testing.	0
ClaimBuster	6275	I have a deep religious faith.	1
ClaimBuster	6276	Sooner or later you get 11 more boys that can run like the devil that weigh 250 pounds and they might win district.	0
ClaimBuster	6277	Now, I have not blocked the SALT II treaty, as Mr. Carter and Mr. Mondale suggest I have.	1
ClaimBuster	6278	I think the major reason for a decrease in participation that we have experienced ever since 1960 has been the deep discouragement of the American people about the performance of public officials.	1
ClaimBuster	6279	Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it's been debunked numerous times.	1
ClaimBuster	6280	I have devoted 24 years of my life to public service and I've said this before and I'll say it again, if you entrust me with the presidency, I may not be the most exciting politician, but I will work hard for you every day.	0
ClaimBuster	6281	But there are a lot of refugees, women and children -- think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he'd been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces.	1
ClaimBuster	6282	Production on government land of oil is down 14 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	6283	As a matter of fact,.	0
ClaimBuster	6284	The American people are ready to make sacrifices if they are part of the process.	0
ClaimBuster	6285	We sit on a conspicuous stage.	0
ClaimBuster	6286	We've had a uh - higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years.	1
ClaimBuster	6287	You're going to be examining our proposals tonight and in the future, and energy independence is a way to do that, is one of them.	0
ClaimBuster	6288	three ways to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	6289	I live in a state where manufacturing job growth has far outpaced the nation in the last few years, where we have created more private sector jobs since Mr. Bush has been president than have been created in the entire rest of the country, where Mr. Bush's labor secretary said job growth has been enormous.	1
ClaimBuster	6290	Now, many here who are not involved in farming don't -- won't follow this, so just forgive me.	0
ClaimBuster	6291	I think those are pretty important priorities.	0
ClaimBuster	6292	When President Bush came into office, we had a budget surplus and the national debt was a little over $5 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	6293	Yes, I've been very specific about those, John.	0
ClaimBuster	6294	But I think uh - uh - a balanced approach, with everybody being part of it and a striving for unselfishness, could help as it did in 1973 to let people sacrifice for their own country.	0
ClaimBuster	6295	And we have to be very strong.	0
ClaimBuster	6296	I mean, you can like it or not like it.	0
ClaimBuster	6297	I don't think you do think that.	0
ClaimBuster	6298	You can't let public persuasion sway you, because the job is to enforce the law.	0
ClaimBuster	6299	When you've got thousands of people right now in Iowa, right now in Colorado, who are working, creating wind power with good-paying manufacturing jobs, and the Republican senator in that -- in Iowa is all for it, providing tax breaks (ph) to help this work and Governor Romney says I'm opposed.	1
ClaimBuster	6300	(Laughter) But I also think it's important to be somebody who is willing to make those tough choices.	0
ClaimBuster	6301	I think we should support the people of Serbia and Yugoslavia, as they call the Serbia plus Montenegro, and put pressure in every way possible to recognize the lawful outcome of the election.	0
ClaimBuster	6302	Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.	1
ClaimBuster	6303	But we have to have a president who is clear that you don't deal with Russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul.	0
ClaimBuster	6304	I'd like to thank the computer executives and the electronics executives in Silicon Valley, two-thirds of whom are Republicans who said they wanted to sign on to a change in America.	1
ClaimBuster	6305	We're facing a group of folks who have such hatred in their heart, they'll strike anywhere, with any means.	0
ClaimBuster	6306	You can't tell me that a surplus food distribution of five cents po- per person - and that n- nearly six million Americans receiving that - is adequate.	1
ClaimBuster	6307	Japan spends a little over 6% of its gross national product.	1
ClaimBuster	6308	It's who you trust, government or people.	0
ClaimBuster	6309	We need to step up exchange; we need to step up technical assistance so that trained people in these newly developing countries can operate the economies.	0
ClaimBuster	6310	The one thing I have done is lay it squarely on the table in front of the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	6311	Under my leadership we're going to win this war in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	6312	We talked about the economy is more important.	1
ClaimBuster	6313	Then you go to your own pharmacy.	0
ClaimBuster	6314	But I am happy, in fact I'm thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation, because it is a world-renowned charity and I am so proud of the work that it does.	0
ClaimBuster	6315	We're talking about some difference.	0
ClaimBuster	6316	But when these huge deficits went in place in 1981, what's called the real interest rates -- the spread between inflation and what a loan costs you doubled -- and that's still the case today.	1
ClaimBuster	6317	They don't want just Quemoy and Matsu; they don't want just Formosa; they want the world.	0
ClaimBuster	6318	But whether I agree or disagree with some individual, or what he may say, or how he may say it, I don't think there's any way that we can suggest that because people believe in God and go to church, that they should not want reflected in those people and those causes they support, their own belief in morality, and in the high traditions and principles which we've abandoned so much in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	6319	As you all know, I've been buying 30-minute segments to talk about issues.	1
ClaimBuster	6320	Free trade between ourselves and Colombia, I just recited to you the benefits of concluding that agreement, a billion dollars of American dollars that could have gone to creating jobs and businesses in the United States, opening up those markets.	1
ClaimBuster	6321	And that's the testimony of uh - General Twining and the Assistant Secretary of State in fifty-eight.	1
ClaimBuster	6322	And it's a West Texas painting, a painting of a mountain scene.	1
ClaimBuster	6323	But, again, I want to tell the American people, we're doing everything we can at home, but you better have a president who chases these terrorists down and bring them to justice before they hurt us again.	0
ClaimBuster	6324	Ronald Reagan was the last president...	1
ClaimBuster	6325	But I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are -- she doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking.	1
ClaimBuster	6326	And you know the only time it's ever been invoked?	0
ClaimBuster	6327	Most of all, I'd like to thank all of you who have touched me in some way over this last year, all the thousands of you whom I've seen.	0
ClaimBuster	6328	Now, as far as running away from my party is concerned, Senator Kennedy has said that we have no compassion for the poor, that we are against progress - the enemies of progress, is the term that he's used, and the like.	1
ClaimBuster	6329	They said even if we are the strongest if we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do something if we don't have a clear vision of the military, if we don't stop extending our troops all around the world and nation building missions, then we're going to have a serious problem coming down the road, and I'm going to prevent that.	0
ClaimBuster	6330	We've got to strengthen the family.	0
ClaimBuster	6331	If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess.	0
ClaimBuster	6332	Well, I think Governor Clinton is committed.	0
ClaimBuster	6333	I think it also is a strength.	0
ClaimBuster	6334	A President must know right then.	0
ClaimBuster	6335	The when I can't tell you.	0
ClaimBuster	6336	And it seemed to me if you want to send a signal, you've got to send a signal, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	6337	Our nation in the last eight years has been divided as never before.	0
ClaimBuster	6338	"Several months ago the Vietnam government said, ""We are ready to sit down and negotiate for release of information on MIAs."	1
ClaimBuster	6339	And I'm glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy.	0
ClaimBuster	6340	And if you end up losing your health care from your employer, you've got to go out on the open market and try to buy it.	0
ClaimBuster	6341	And therefore, I've made some proposals to strengthen the domestic oil industry by more incentive going in to look for, and find, and produce oil; made some incentives in terms of secondary and tertiary production.	1
ClaimBuster	6342	If you were an effective senator, you could have done it.	0
ClaimBuster	6343	Of course the president will take credit for that.	0
ClaimBuster	6344	With respect to Iran, the British, French, and Germans were the ones who initiated an effort without the United States, regrettably, to begin to try to move to curb the nuclear possibilities in Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	6345	It's not only what's your philosophy and what's your position on issues, but can you get things done?	0
ClaimBuster	6346	There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.	0
ClaimBuster	6347	The Governor talks about limits, what we can't do, opposes these two modernization systems, talks now about well, we'll develop some new kind of a missile.	0
ClaimBuster	6348	And that's why early in my administration I called the attorney general and the U. S. attorneys and said: Put together a task force all around the country to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns.	1
ClaimBuster	6349	They produce the most jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	6350	In addition to that, jobs programs to re-employ the youth in our cities would be very high on my priority list, both the Youth Opportunities Act of 1980 and a billion-dollar program that I would recommend to put youth to work in energy projects, in conservation projects, in projects that would carry out some of the great national goals of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	6351	I'm totally focussed on the fact that we still could have enterprise zones, according to both parties, but we don't.	1
ClaimBuster	6352	And you look at a who's who in these campaigns around the 2 candidates.	0
ClaimBuster	6353	Our relations with Japan have never been better.	0
ClaimBuster	6354	Now I don't know all the answers.	0
ClaimBuster	6355	We're up to $20 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	6356	We talk about fiscal matters.	0
ClaimBuster	6357	I've spent my entire life in the service of this nation and putting my country first.	1
ClaimBuster	6358	When we're talking about math that doesn't add up, how about $4 trillion of deficits over the last four years, $5 trillion?	1
ClaimBuster	6359	There's too much special interests and too many lobbyists working there.	0
ClaimBuster	6360	We're going to train troops, and we are.	0
ClaimBuster	6361	It is the bipartisan bill that is now pending in the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	6362	The great contest for the presidency is about the future, who can lead, who can get things done.	0
ClaimBuster	6363	We're now working on the communications industry.	1
ClaimBuster	6364	We only have ten divisions now.	1
ClaimBuster	6365	It is something that Congress has proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	6366	But no matter what it takes in the future to keep Social Security sound, it must be kept that way.	0
ClaimBuster	6367	Number two, we've got to make sure that we have the best education system in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	6368	This is not mud slinging.	0
ClaimBuster	6369	Well, we always, with the normal growth in our country and increase in population, increase the number of jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	6370	And he said that the reason he changed his mind was, in part, because he was seeking the endorsement of the National Rifle Association.	1
ClaimBuster	6371	But we also have every right to expect the Russians to behave in a fashion and keeping with a -- with a -- with a country who respects international boundaries and the norms of international behavior.	0
ClaimBuster	6372	He has every right to exercise his passion, as what he said, a strong, progressive liberal.	0
ClaimBuster	6373	It was a glorious day.	0
ClaimBuster	6374	I believe experience counts, but it's not everything.	0
ClaimBuster	6375	I've seen the family values of my people in Arkansas.	0
ClaimBuster	6376	He said that many of these countries equate space developments with scientific productivity and scientific advancement.	1
ClaimBuster	6377	What I do believe is that we can find good, common ground on issues of parental consent or parental notification.	0
ClaimBuster	6378	And I attempted, as many have in the past, of including that so that it is constitutional.	1
ClaimBuster	6379	It starts with a billion dollar pay raise for the men and women who wear the uniform.	1
ClaimBuster	6380	We have to change that.	0
ClaimBuster	6381	But I also believe we need an agricultural policy which doesn't cost us 15 to 20 to 25 billion dollars a year that it's been costing us over the course of the past three or four years under this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	6382	I will keep us strong, but you'll not do that unless you command that budget and make certain we get the strength that we need.	0
ClaimBuster	6383	And so we took the right action and didn't allow contaminated medicine into our country.	1
ClaimBuster	6384	And if I'm elected president that's gonna be a top priority of mine to completely revise the structure of the federal government, to make it economical, efficient, purposeful and manageable for a change.	0
ClaimBuster	6385	"It's the side to see the day that is coming, not to see the day that is gone. """	0
ClaimBuster	6386	Over the last eight years, we've seen that dream diminish.	0
ClaimBuster	6387	But I don't want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them.	1
ClaimBuster	6388	And Donald knows a lot about this.	0
ClaimBuster	6389	Which is a worse decision?	0
ClaimBuster	6390	But let's talk about the question you asked, Lester.	0
ClaimBuster	6391	I look forward to the final weeks of this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	6392	We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them.	0
ClaimBuster	6393	I'll do it by more drilling, more permits and licenses.	0
ClaimBuster	6394	We can't say we're going to do things and then not explain in concrete terms how we're going to pay for it.	0
ClaimBuster	6395	When I get to Washington, coming in as an outsider, one of the major responsibilities that - that I will have on my shoulder is a complete reorganization of the - of the executive branch of government.	0
ClaimBuster	6396	That's how in banking it works.	0
ClaimBuster	6397	Let's vow to work together to do something about it.	0
ClaimBuster	6398	Natural gas production is the highest it's been in decades.	1
ClaimBuster	6399	Look, the world's temperature is going up, weather patterns are changing, storms are getting more violent and unpredictable.	1
ClaimBuster	6400	I'm just trying to keep up with John.	0
ClaimBuster	6401	But when it comes to our military, what we have to think about is not, you know just budgets, we've got to think about capabilities.	0
ClaimBuster	6402	I had a single mom and my grandparents raised me and it was because of the help of scholarships and my grandmother scrimping on things that she might have wanted to purchase and my mom, at one point, getting food stamps in order for us to put food on the table.	1
ClaimBuster	6403	He was a fantastic governor of Missouri.	0
ClaimBuster	6404	And one of the reasons that's important is that Israel cannot have direct dialogue with some of the people on the other side of conflicts, especially during times of tension, unless that dialogue comes through us.	0
ClaimBuster	6405	One of the 2 groups has raised it to an art form.	1
ClaimBuster	6406	If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government.	0
ClaimBuster	6407	I raise the child-care credit by $1,000 for families to help them be able to take care of their kids.	1
ClaimBuster	6408	I don't uh - look at the picture as bleakly as you have indicated in your question, Mr. Trewhitt.	0
ClaimBuster	6409	We changed many provisions I authored, cover preexisting conditions, portability, and there are other things we can do.	1
ClaimBuster	6410	We also need to have a great reduction in agencies and programs.	0
ClaimBuster	6411	And inflation hits everybody: those who are working and those who are on welfare.	1
ClaimBuster	6412	-- all of these wonderful folks are going to have a chance to get some of their questions answered.	0
ClaimBuster	6413	And one last point I want to make.	0
ClaimBuster	6414	So we're going to make sure that people we trade with around the world play by the rules.	0
ClaimBuster	6415	I think these crimes are different.	0
ClaimBuster	6416	When it comes to going after Osama bin Laden, you said, well, any president would make that call.	1
ClaimBuster	6417	That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders, OK?	1
ClaimBuster	6418	Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently.	1
ClaimBuster	6419	As a matter of fact, Mr. Ford has made a political football out of the defense budget.	1
ClaimBuster	6420	I salute those who participate in the political process.	0
ClaimBuster	6421	And I think it was Justice Black who talked about great nations, like great men, must keep their word.	0
ClaimBuster	6422	It's not taking anything away from schools, it's new money.	0
ClaimBuster	6423	And the significance of prestige, really, is because we're so identified with the cause of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	6424	That's why we have, as I said, people under federal indictment and charges.	0
ClaimBuster	6425	Will we use the prosperity to enrich all of our families and not just a few?	0
ClaimBuster	6426	And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling.	0
ClaimBuster	6427	And -- and -- we should not have wasted these four years to the extent they -- they continue to be able to spin these centrifuges and get that much closer.	0
ClaimBuster	6428	That's why everything I'll do is designed to help small businesses grow and add jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	6429	One, we need more community health centers.	0
ClaimBuster	6430	But you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didn't even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable.	0
ClaimBuster	6431	We're doing a little better in interdiction.	0
ClaimBuster	6432	I don't think top-down works in America.	0
ClaimBuster	6433	We need to stand for human rights.	0
ClaimBuster	6434	Well, just listen to what you heard.	0
ClaimBuster	6435	So whether it's diabetes or cancer, they come to hospitals later and it costs America more.	1
ClaimBuster	6436	I favor strict controls on how much you can spend running for Congress, strict limits on political action committees, requirements that people running for Congress appear in open public debates like we're doing now.	0
ClaimBuster	6437	We know freedom is a powerful, powerful, powerful force, much bigger than the United States of America, as we saw recently in the Balkans.	0
ClaimBuster	6438	I have a $4,000 tuition tax credit that goes to parents -- and kids, if they're earning for themselves -- to be able to pay for college.	1
ClaimBuster	6439	In the terrorist situation, there are terrorist factions all over.	0
ClaimBuster	6440	Overall in America cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last four years, casual drug use down 13 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	6441	If you'd pass that message on to him.	0
ClaimBuster	6442	Number two is for people coming along that are young, what I do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan.	0
ClaimBuster	6443	I would like to make a change in the regulation that discriminates against a wife who works and finds that she then is faced with a choice between her father's or her husband's benefits, if he dies first, or what she has paid in; but it does not recognize that she has also been paying in herself, and she is entitled to more than she presently can get.	0
ClaimBuster	6444	It will not be our ambition that will determine it, because greatness is not something that is written on a campaign poster.	0
ClaimBuster	6445	There was only four of us there.	1
ClaimBuster	6446	A family involves at least one parent, whether natural or adoptive or foster, and children.	1
ClaimBuster	6447	And in 12 years as governor I guess I've taken on every interest group there was in my state at one time or another to fight for change.	1
ClaimBuster	6448	He is for registration of guns.	1
ClaimBuster	6449	And now we're fighting them now.	1
ClaimBuster	6450	Labels don't fit, ladies and gentlemen.	0
ClaimBuster	6451	People are going to get paid.	0
ClaimBuster	6452	Now, accountability, we basically agree on accountability.	0
ClaimBuster	6453	We wanted to preserve human dignity in southern Africa.	0
ClaimBuster	6454	See, if I say anything it's going to be misconstrued.	0
ClaimBuster	6455	I don't have any plan to cut education funding and -- and grants that go to people going to college.	0
ClaimBuster	6456	We ought to be shutting those down.	0
ClaimBuster	6457	Who gave it that name?	0
ClaimBuster	6458	It's not going to work if we open up a dialogue with Kim Jong Il.	0
ClaimBuster	6459	Well, I think you're overlooking that we have had major accomplishments in the first term.	1
ClaimBuster	6460	Well, I think the fact that they're facing these repeated call-ups, some of them two and three deployments, and there's a stop- loss policy that prevents people from being able to get out when their time was up, is a reflection of the bad judgment this president exercised in how he has engaged in the world and deployed our forces.	1
ClaimBuster	6461	The Vice President talks about a thousand points of light.	1
ClaimBuster	6462	If a president doesn't reach out and bring people in and be inclusive, then how are we going to get over those barriers?	0
ClaimBuster	6463	A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in Wisconsin and Minnesota, he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so.	0
ClaimBuster	6464	I think there was a good opportunity to bring Republicans and Democrats together to reform the Social Security system so seniors will never go without.	0
ClaimBuster	6465	In the last two years, I have made policy decisions involving - long-range difficulties and policies and made day-to-day judgments not only as president of the United States but as the leader of the free world What is the result of that leadership?	1
ClaimBuster	6466	And that's because we're doing exactly what we should be doing to try to promote a moderate Syrian leadership and a -- an effective transition so that we get Assad out.	0
ClaimBuster	6467	But this is a very liberal administration.	0
ClaimBuster	6468	You know the Japanese are breathing down our necks on this.	0
ClaimBuster	6469	The president's policies throughout the Middle East began with an apology tour and -- and -- and pursue a strategy of leading from behind, and this strategy is unraveling before our very eyes.	0
ClaimBuster	6470	We ought to do that, then we can have a commission.	0
ClaimBuster	6471	"You chose not to because you were afraid of the appointment of, quote, ""conservative judges."""	0
ClaimBuster	6472	And this weakened our relationships with Israel a great deal and put a cloud on the total commitment that our people feel toward the Israelis.	0
ClaimBuster	6473	It had several tax increases phased in over a period of time -- there are two more yet to come between now and 1989.	1
ClaimBuster	6474	You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have -- and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times.	1
ClaimBuster	6475	Do people want to be identified with us?	0
ClaimBuster	6476	I don't claim to know his heart.	1
ClaimBuster	6477	What I will do is I'll put in place an employment verification system and make sure that employers that hire people who have come here illegally are sanctioned for doing so.	0
ClaimBuster	6478	I have traveled to forty-eight of the fifty states and in my travels I have learned what the people of the United States are thinking about.	1
ClaimBuster	6479	Governor -- here -- here's -- here's one thing...	0
ClaimBuster	6480	"They went to him 5 days before they were killed and said, ""Please, take them out of there.''"	1
ClaimBuster	6481	Let me, Jason, come back to you a minute because there is a big difference in the defense budget.	0
ClaimBuster	6482	And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe.	0
ClaimBuster	6483	I'd never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we're going to really make lives better for people.	0
ClaimBuster	6484	In addition to that, we have to move on other areas that are holding back growth.	0
ClaimBuster	6485	But he's an incumbent, and we've got to look at all the facts.	1
ClaimBuster	6486	Words matter when you run for president.	0
ClaimBuster	6487	And I believe it incumbent upon us to be the defenders of the United States and the defenders of freedom; and to do that, we must give this country leadership and we must get America moving again.	0
ClaimBuster	6488	People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more.	1
ClaimBuster	6489	And I think now we've got a problem.	0
ClaimBuster	6490	Let me just point out, just today in the Los Angeles Times Clyde Prestowitz, who was one of President Reagan's leading trade advisers and a life-long conservative Republican, endorsed my candidacy because he knows that I'll have a free and fair trade policy, a hard-headed, realistic policy, and not get caught up in rubber-stamping everything the Bush administration did.	1
ClaimBuster	6491	And I would like to see us a little more free, as we once were.	0
ClaimBuster	6492	We've been uh - having a very clear decision in the last eight years.	0
ClaimBuster	6493	I think the matter is settled once and for all.	0
ClaimBuster	6494	And I've been very clear to them.	0
ClaimBuster	6495	"My message to our troops is, ""Thank you for what you're doing."	0
ClaimBuster	6496	I've never depended on powerful political figures to put me in office.	0
ClaimBuster	6497	... because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I'm not surprised.	1
ClaimBuster	6498	Well, mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	6499	And that record shows he just hasn't been able to cut the deficit, to put in place reforms for Medicare and Social Security to preserve them, to get us the rising incomes we need.	1
ClaimBuster	6500	I vetoed 993 measures without having a veto overturned.	1
ClaimBuster	6501	I don't think the American people believe that.	0
ClaimBuster	6502	Does this show that Communism has the bigger pull, or freedom has the bigger pull?	0
ClaimBuster	6503	So she talks about taking them out.	0
ClaimBuster	6504	The question is, will we be better off four years from now than we are today?	0
ClaimBuster	6505	But I have -- thanks to my mother, God rest her soul -- the firmest possible belief and faith in God.	0
ClaimBuster	6506	And when people vote, I think you're going to see a very strong verdict by the American people that they favor the approach that I'm talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	6507	I want to make sure prescription drugs are available for all seniors.	0
ClaimBuster	6508	And secondly, in terms of the cutting of the Coast Guard, the Democratic controlled Congress, so please help us with that, who cut $70 million from the Coast Guard out of the interdiction effort on narcotics.	1
ClaimBuster	6509	I believe in being strong and resolute and determined.	0
ClaimBuster	6510	He says that he's going to give you a $5,000 tax credit.	1
ClaimBuster	6511	But you want to know the truth?	0
ClaimBuster	6512	And in a way, I should be complaining.	0
ClaimBuster	6513	We have met your sons and daughters.	1
ClaimBuster	6514	And I don't think a lot of people are going to want to keep what they have today.	0
ClaimBuster	6515	Are we going to double on top-down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says America does best when the middle class does best?	0
ClaimBuster	6516	Now, to go back to your question, Nikki, we're not getting the best cooperation in the world today.	0
ClaimBuster	6517	Now, Governor Romney has taken a different approach throughout this campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	6518	This is basically a problem that is a primary concern to the European Community.	0
ClaimBuster	6519	Nobody running can promise that, there's too much change in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	6520	It's been very well studied.	1
ClaimBuster	6521	And we don't want to waste taxpayer money.	0
ClaimBuster	6522	We sent it over to the House, that you could import drugs.	1
ClaimBuster	6523	They tried to have a national health care plan.	1
ClaimBuster	6524	And that's why this election is so terribly important.	0
ClaimBuster	6525	And I suspect one of us will have a pick at the end of next year -- the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	6526	Now, I know the criticism of this.	0
ClaimBuster	6527	I'll tell the American people, but this man said I'll get you a million dollars a day in pro bono advertising, something that's very hard for the government to do.	1
ClaimBuster	6528	Let me tell you who I associate with.	0
ClaimBuster	6529	Our home initiative -- our home ownership initiative -- HOPE -- that passed the Congress is a good start for having people own their own homes instead of living in these deadly tenements.	1
ClaimBuster	6530	Part of my tax package which is paid for in my balanced budget plan would exempt up to half a million dollars in gains from people when they sell their homes, which I think is the biggest capital gains benefit we could give to most ordinary Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	6531	So one of the things that I think we have to recognize is pursuing the same kinds of policies that we pursued over the last eight years is not going to bring down the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	6532	We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China.	0
ClaimBuster	6533	I don't have a response.	1
ClaimBuster	6534	And we need a fresh start, a new credibility, a president who can bring allies to our side.	0
ClaimBuster	6535	Governor, the people in Detroit don't forget.	0
ClaimBuster	6536	And there's just not going to be enough money.	0
ClaimBuster	6537	We can't impose it, but we need to nourish it and that's the kind of thing that I would do as president -- follow those three commitments into the future.	0
ClaimBuster	6538	So I'm not planning on making changes there.	0
ClaimBuster	6539	The FDA has made its decision.	1
ClaimBuster	6540	And so the question is how to get them going again.	0
ClaimBuster	6541	And Mr. Ford hasn't done anything about it.	1
ClaimBuster	6542	That's the way I would do it.	0
ClaimBuster	6543	The point is, they'll get to decide what to think.	0
ClaimBuster	6544	The fact is for the last few years in the Congress, we've faced a lot of opposition to them.	0
ClaimBuster	6545	I don't believe that's the way to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	6546	We -- we need to have -- we need to have employers reward employees who join health clubs and practice wellness and fitness.	0
ClaimBuster	6547	The fact is that the Kyoto treaty was flawed.	0
ClaimBuster	6548	It is essential that a man who's president of this country certainly stand for every program that will mean for growth.	0
ClaimBuster	6549	And, you know, we can't be -- we can't allow ourselves to get overextended.	0
ClaimBuster	6550	Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community.	1
ClaimBuster	6551	Part of the problem here is that for many of you, wages and incomes have flat-lined.	0
ClaimBuster	6552	And we have former members of Congress now residing in federal prison because of the evils of this earmarking and pork-barrel spending.	1
ClaimBuster	6553	Sixty to seventy percent of our colored children do not finish high school.	1
ClaimBuster	6554	But she is absolutely right.	0
ClaimBuster	6555	Number two, we take some programs that we are doing to keep, like Medicaid, which is a program for the poor; we'll take that healthcare program for the poor and we give it to the states to run because states run these programs more efficiently.	1
ClaimBuster	6556	It was very easy to do.	0
ClaimBuster	6557	And what we can now do is free up some resources, to, for example, put Americans back to work, especially our veterans, rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our schools, making sure that, you know, our veterans are getting the care that they need when it comes to post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, making sure that the certifications that they need for good jobs of the future are in place.	0
ClaimBuster	6558	None of them uh are responsible for health care itself.	0
ClaimBuster	6559	You take the raw product you produce, I presume you're a farmer, off your farm, and you convert it.	0
ClaimBuster	6560	Our Government has, in the last year or so, taken out of multiple use millions of acres of public lands that once were - well, they were public lands subject to multiple use - exploration for minerals and so forth.	1
ClaimBuster	6561	President Obama -- Anderson, excuse me.	0
ClaimBuster	6562	And I, for one, am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position.	1
ClaimBuster	6563	And maybe it's hardly doable.	0
ClaimBuster	6564	Look, the cost of lowering rates for everybody across the board, 20 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	6565	Whether we're going to give our children a world-class education.	0
ClaimBuster	6566	That means he'll either have to raise your taxes by $900 billion or go into the Social Security surplus for $900 billion.	0
ClaimBuster	6567	I have just signed legislation to add to our ability to deal, along with our allies, with this terrorist problem.	1
ClaimBuster	6568	Well, we've gone through a tough four years.	0
ClaimBuster	6569	Now, what he doesn't tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	6570	Now Senator McCain and I agree with your idea that we've got to help homeowners.	0
ClaimBuster	6571	I am going to renegotiate NAFTA.	0
ClaimBuster	6572	We can do much, much better, but we ought not try to convince the American people that America is a country that's coming apart at the seams.	0
ClaimBuster	6573	We've never let the Congress and the Foreign Relations, Senate Intelligence Committees see them.	1
ClaimBuster	6574	I ran one of the largest district attorney's offices in America, one of the ten largest.	1
ClaimBuster	6575	You haven't seen the commercial?	0
ClaimBuster	6576	That's not what the Constitution says.	0
ClaimBuster	6577	He talked about the reconstruction efforts that are beginning to take hold.	1
ClaimBuster	6578	Number five, champion small business.	0
ClaimBuster	6579	Some of it was excised, but the part dealing with political terrorism was continued.	0
ClaimBuster	6580	And I'm going to make it a priority.	0
ClaimBuster	6581	My uncle was a victim of poisonous gas there.	1
ClaimBuster	6582	Let me address it but also talk about the weapons the president just talked about, because every part of the president's answer just now promises you more of the same over the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	6583	And so, the answer to your question is: When our general is on the ground and Ambassador Negroponte tells me that Iraq is ready to defend herself from these terrorists, that elections will have been held by then, that their stability and that they're on their way to, you know, a nation that's free; that's when.	0
ClaimBuster	6584	We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt.	1
ClaimBuster	6585	And now we have all these people just up the road in Los Angeles County, we have people from 150 different racial and ethnic groups and tons of different religions, but the fundamental tenets of virtually every religion are the same, and what I try to do is to support policies that would respect religion and then help parents inculcate those values to their children.	1
ClaimBuster	6586	Four years ago, right here in this forum, he was asked the same question: Can't people be able to import drugs from Canada?	1
ClaimBuster	6587	If it says tilt, you don't get any gun.	0
ClaimBuster	6588	Before Senator Dole left the Senate, he and Mr. Gingrich also were recommending that we pass these tax cuts only insofar as we could pay for them.	1
ClaimBuster	6589	As far as Berlin is concerned, there isn't any question about the necessity of defending Berlin; the rights of people there to be free; and there isn't any question about what the united American people - Republicans and Democrats alike - would do in the event there were an attempt by the Communists to take over Berlin.	0
ClaimBuster	6590	All I know is that we have firm government credit to guarantee the pensions.	1
ClaimBuster	6591	We had the highest fatalities among U.S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002.	1
ClaimBuster	6592	We're number one in autos again, record numbers of new small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	6593	Jack Kemp is my running mate, doing an outstanding job.	1
ClaimBuster	6594	And if you just add the numbers up, he still hasn't denied it, he spends more money on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1% than all his new proposals for prescription drugs, healthcare, education, and national defense combined.	1
ClaimBuster	6595	We can do better than that.	0
ClaimBuster	6596	And I know that they know that I'll take care of them.	0
ClaimBuster	6597	That's going to help Jeremy get a job.	0
ClaimBuster	6598	I believe we ought to give seniors more options.	0
ClaimBuster	6599	Let me say something about Columbine.	0
ClaimBuster	6600	Well, I have no idea.	0
ClaimBuster	6601	Somebody that can come to Washington and say let's forget all the finger pointing and get positive things done on Medicare, prescription drugs, Social Security, and so I take him for his word.	0
ClaimBuster	6602	I come out of the Democratic party, which in this century has produced Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, and which supported and sustained these programs which I've discussed tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	6603	I think I've addressed it.	0
ClaimBuster	6604	We have not maintained our position and our prestige.	0
ClaimBuster	6605	I'm all for oil production.	0
ClaimBuster	6606	I mean, there needs to be a wholesale effort against racial profiling, which is illiterate children.	0
ClaimBuster	6607	And we built up uh - an awareness among the uh - voters of this country, particularly those in whose primaries I entered - thirty of them, nobody's ever done that before - about who I was and what I stood for.	0
ClaimBuster	6608	The worst inflation since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	6609	And so we -- we -- we've got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump -- and, you know, winter's coming and home heating oil -- as it is our national security and the issue of climate change that's so important.	0
ClaimBuster	6610	This is a four-star general.	1
ClaimBuster	6611	And when she said deplorables, she meant it.	0
ClaimBuster	6612	And that begins with a strong economy here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	6613	It's been one of secrecy and exclusion.	0
ClaimBuster	6614	"And if he had been in power, in other words, if we would have said, ""Let the inspectors work, or let's, you know, hope to talk him out."	0
ClaimBuster	6615	He has voted in the United States Senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42,000 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	6616	You worry about the quality and the safety of your children, and the quality of education.	0
ClaimBuster	6617	I think we have to revita1ize our society.	0
ClaimBuster	6618	I would work with our allies in Asia, in Europe, in the Middle East, and elsewhere.	0
ClaimBuster	6619	I would have uh - done it opposite.	0
ClaimBuster	6620	Yes, you can lick inflation by increasing productivity and by decreasing the cost of government to the place that we have balanced budgets, and are no longer grinding out printing press money, flooding the market with it because the Government is spending more than it takes in.	0
ClaimBuster	6621	I wrote about that in my book...	1
ClaimBuster	6622	There won't be 10 millionaires and 14 lawyers in the cabinet.	0
ClaimBuster	6623	Why should they insure somebody when the government's going to insure it for them?	0
ClaimBuster	6624	The Department of Energy has a multi-billion-dollar budget in excess of $10 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	6625	I would never and have never in all the years I've been there imposed a litmus test on any nominee to the court.	1
ClaimBuster	6626	We have done things to help small businesses, agriculture, and so much else.	1
ClaimBuster	6627	"He said, back in 2006, ""Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money."""	1
ClaimBuster	6628	It's your money, it's a part of your retirement benefit.	1
ClaimBuster	6629	I understand the limited role of the federal government, but it could be a constructive role when it comes to reform, by insisting that there be a strong accountability systems.	0
ClaimBuster	6630	"One is Strobe Talbott in his classic book, ""Deadly Gambits.''"	0
ClaimBuster	6631	And they want this country to go in a new direction.	0
ClaimBuster	6632	My friends, we have gone to all four corners of the Earth and shed American blood in defense, usually, of somebody else's freedom and our own.	1
ClaimBuster	6633	Saddam Hussein now sits in a prison cell.	1
ClaimBuster	6634	Two days ago we ate lunch at a restaurant.	1
ClaimBuster	6635	Again, see, I didn't create this problem.	1
ClaimBuster	6636	Look, I respect his children.	0
ClaimBuster	6637	He said that these missiles were less dangerous than ballistic missiles because you could fire them, and you could recall them if you decided there'd been a miscalculation.	1
ClaimBuster	6638	She talks about health care.	1
ClaimBuster	6639	And I share them with him.	0
ClaimBuster	6640	We've spent $4.7 billion a year in the State of Texas for uninsured people.	1
ClaimBuster	6641	One of my concerns, though, is I don't want to federalize the local police forces.	0
ClaimBuster	6642	I don't have to worry in the near term about the Federal Reserve.	0
ClaimBuster	6643	And I honor their sacrifices.	0
ClaimBuster	6644	A charter school run by some people from Teach For America.	1
ClaimBuster	6645	So, yes, I told the American Legion National!	0
ClaimBuster	6646	And then we'll fill other gaps by covering the parents of those children when the family is poor or up to two and a half times the poverty rate.	0
ClaimBuster	6647	We have -- as I said, we've let government get completely out of control.	0
ClaimBuster	6648	... 600 -- wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times.	0
ClaimBuster	6649	To destroy life to save life is -- it's one of the real ethical dilemmas that we face.	0
ClaimBuster	6650	It doesn't set a times schedule.	0
ClaimBuster	6651	What is more moral than peace, and the United States is at peace today?	0
ClaimBuster	6652	I think it would be a great gesture.	0
ClaimBuster	6653	She doesn't have the look.	0
ClaimBuster	6654	And the magnitude of the tax cuts that you're talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow.	0
ClaimBuster	6655	He apparently wants to spend billions on the MX on railroad cars, a weapons system we don't need and can't afford.	0
ClaimBuster	6656	As the politics change, his positions change.	0
ClaimBuster	6657	He wants you to believe that because he can't come here and tell you that he's created new jobs for America.	0
ClaimBuster	6658	the tone we've just heard might just be the tone we have for the rest of the campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	6659	We've always been a nation which was ambitious for America and we move forward.	0
ClaimBuster	6660	But what did we learn with DNC?	0
ClaimBuster	6661	The important point here is, though, the American people have become so cynical about our politics, because all they see is a tit- for-tat and back-and-forth.	0
ClaimBuster	6662	"And I think if we get rid of the labels--and I'm not keeping count, but I think Mr. Bush has used the label ""liberal"" at least ten times if I had a dollar, George, for every time you used that label, I'd qualify for one of those tax breaks for the rich that you want to give away."	0
ClaimBuster	6663	And 95 percent of working families, 95 percent of you out there, will get a tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	6664	I don't think that anybody can say that Johnson and Kennedy neglected the poor and the destitute people in this country or around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	6665	The trial lawyers and I don't -- you know, my wife's a lawyer.	1
ClaimBuster	6666	They want those civil rights laws enforced.	0
ClaimBuster	6667	It is not midnight in America, Senator.	1
ClaimBuster	6668	This is a place where my opponent and I have strong disagreement.	1
ClaimBuster	6669	I think that that's an important part of being a parent.	0
ClaimBuster	6670	They want the equal rights amendment ratified.	0
ClaimBuster	6671	Number two, on the question of the U-2 flights.	0
ClaimBuster	6672	You know, mine doesn't work that way.	0
ClaimBuster	6673	Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism.	1
ClaimBuster	6674	In some ways this is just a new label for something that has been going on for years.	1
ClaimBuster	6675	It would only give us a few months' worth of oil and the oil wouldn't start flowing for many years into the future.	0
ClaimBuster	6676	That's twice the amount of rate of return than the current Social Security Trust.	1
ClaimBuster	6677	That wasn't best for me and I knew it in the very beginning.	0
ClaimBuster	6678	Because when you do not tax, and tax enough to pay for your outgo, you pay it many times over in higher prices and inflation; and I simply will not do that.	0
ClaimBuster	6679	We got Kuwait back to the emir but he's still not his nuclear, his chemical, his bacteriological and he's still over there, right?	0
ClaimBuster	6680	That means you can take a line and cut out some of the pork out of a meaningful bill.	0
ClaimBuster	6681	He's extending the Administration's commitment.	1
ClaimBuster	6682	And it permits - economists on the East Coast and West think it's good - it permits the president to sort out the priorities, and we continue to grow because I will not raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	6683	And months ago, many of us were pressing for action.	1
ClaimBuster	6684	Has an 11 year old son and can't let that son compete in sports and Little League, because he's afraid he's going to get hurt and he won't be able to provide health insurance to pay those bills.	1
ClaimBuster	6685	So more trade but on fair terms -- and favor investment in America.	0
ClaimBuster	6686	Well, I think one thing that distinguishes is experience.	0
ClaimBuster	6687	What I am trying to indicate is that the tide of history's on our side, and that we can keep it on our side, because we're on the right side.	0
ClaimBuster	6688	One is by ex- the programs such as aid to education.	0
ClaimBuster	6689	What your plan does is to duplicate what's already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can't deny you if you've -- if it's been under 90 days.	1
ClaimBuster	6690	No, Mr. Kraft, we're spending very significant amounts of money now, some $200 billion a year, almost 50 percent of our total federal expenditure uh - by the federal government at the present time for human needs.	1
ClaimBuster	6691	I said it was a mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	6692	When we compare these two records in the areas that Senator Kennedy has - has discussed tonight, I think we find that America has been moving ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	6693	Five cents a day - that's what the food package averages per person.	1
ClaimBuster	6694	So that would be priority number one.	0
ClaimBuster	6695	Mr. Greenberg, I think my opponent in this debate tonight is overlooking one other very important fact.	0
ClaimBuster	6696	America is not temporary; we're forever.	0
ClaimBuster	6697	They put in $30 thousand of their own money and got a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in tax savings.	1
ClaimBuster	6698	I would like our farmers feeding the world.	0
ClaimBuster	6699	That is the part that requires employers to determine the citizenship of an employee before they're hired.	1
ClaimBuster	6700	I just think I can do that far more effectively, because the most important weapon in doing that is intelligence.	0
ClaimBuster	6701	We've got to reform health care to help you and your budget.	0
ClaimBuster	6702	"And now, five weeks before the election, he's saying that his big, bold idea is, ""Never mind."""	1
ClaimBuster	6703	And I think I got a good plan to help fix those problems at home.	0
ClaimBuster	6704	"But in the case of missile defense, Senator Obama said it had to be, quote, ""proven."""	1
ClaimBuster	6705	That's one of the centerpieces of his campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	6706	There are a number of things that sound good, but frankly, we just can't afford them.	0
ClaimBuster	6707	And we handled it responsibly and I think Captain Miller's testimony to that effect is the best evidence.	0
ClaimBuster	6708	Mr. Reagan, after the election, is going to have to propose a tax increase, and you will have to compare what he proposes.	0
ClaimBuster	6709	A deep commitment to making welfare reform work with incentives to the private sector to move people from welfare to work.	0
ClaimBuster	6710	I will hunt them down, and we'll kill them, we'll capture them.	0
ClaimBuster	6711	He favors this supply maintenance or production controls.	0
ClaimBuster	6712	We knew he'd been -- invaded other countries.	1
ClaimBuster	6713	If I say yes, then that means that we're reigniting the old Cold War.	0
ClaimBuster	6714	Well, Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why I suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up.	1
ClaimBuster	6715	Uh - I might make a correction uh - of what uh - Governor Carter said, uh speaking of uh - uh - gun control, uh - yes, it is true, I believe that the sale of uh - Saturday Night S- Specials should be cut out, but he wants the registration of handguns.	1
ClaimBuster	6716	But he and Mr. Kissinger and others tried to start a new Vietnam in Angola, and it was only the outcry of the American people and the Congress when their secret deal was discovered that prevented our involvement in that conflagration which was taking place there.	1
ClaimBuster	6717	Let me go back to Texas, for example, for a minute.	0
ClaimBuster	6718	But what is the advantage in a low income area of sending a child to a failed school and that being your only choice?	0
ClaimBuster	6719	Vaccine manufacturers are worried about getting sued, and therefore they have backed off from providing this kind of vaccine.	1
ClaimBuster	6720	Join me in the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place.	0
ClaimBuster	6721	I believe what you need to do is some of what Ross is talking about: control the growth of mandatory spending and get taxes down.	0
ClaimBuster	6722	Keep in mind a factory worker has nothing to do with anything except putting it together on the factory floor.	1
ClaimBuster	6723	But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers' salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee.	0
ClaimBuster	6724	Their idea was to have the poorest seniors in the country pay $270 more this year.	1
ClaimBuster	6725	It was under our administration that Mrs. Aquino came in.	1
ClaimBuster	6726	I think one of the problems today with the cities is Federal aid.	0
ClaimBuster	6727	It's the challenges that you don't that end up consuming most of your time.	0
ClaimBuster	6728	And that's exactly what I did.	1
ClaimBuster	6729	That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.	1
ClaimBuster	6730	It's far better for a person sitting in the White House uh - who has a number of options to make certain that the uh - other side, so to speak, doesn't know precisely what you're going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	6731	And the reason Pakistan -- the popular opinion of America had diminished in Pakistan was because we were supporting a dictator, Musharraf, had given him $10 billion over seven years, and he had suspended civil liberties.	1
ClaimBuster	6732	I talk to Silvio Berlusconi.	1
ClaimBuster	6733	I suppose it was hoped when he made that speech that we wouldn't get into a war.	0
ClaimBuster	6734	We have 17 -- 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election.	1
ClaimBuster	6735	I work every day with people.	1
ClaimBuster	6736	I see mothers holding their babies up, so that they can see a man who might be president of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	6737	And I've gotten good people, like former Secretary of the Treasury Bob Rubin, for instance, who showed how to balance budgets and give you a good economy, to help me crunch these numbers and make them work.	1
ClaimBuster	6738	But they lead in very different directions.	0
ClaimBuster	6739	I've called for a 25% reduction in congressional staffs and expenditures.	1
ClaimBuster	6740	In his last litany of misstatements.	0
ClaimBuster	6741	As a matter of fact, I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mr. Mondale's running mate said I wasn't a good Christian.	1
ClaimBuster	6742	I'd rather answer her question first and then I'll be glad to.	0
ClaimBuster	6743	The best poverty program is a job with dignity in the private sector.	0
ClaimBuster	6744	Governor Thompson of Illinois did.	1
ClaimBuster	6745	We'll give you all the equipment you need.	0
ClaimBuster	6746	So let me get to that.	0
ClaimBuster	6747	Now, forget all this talk about a draft.	0
ClaimBuster	6748	School choice -- public, private or religious.	0
ClaimBuster	6749	But I do believe that no one in this country should be denied the right to express themselves, or to even try to persuade others to follow their leader.	0
ClaimBuster	6750	We have a very different outlook.	0
ClaimBuster	6751	That's why I will never stop at anything to hunt down and kill the terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	6752	They create warheads, and we can't.	1
ClaimBuster	6753	Secondly, we need an active exploration program in America.	0
ClaimBuster	6754	We're not going to have a draft, period.	0
ClaimBuster	6755	My attitude is you take preemptive action in order to protect the American people, that you act in order to make this country secure.	0
ClaimBuster	6756	We have to remember, when we talk a tax cut, we're only talking about reducing a tax increase, because this Administration has left us with a built-in tax increase that will amount to $86 billion next year.	1
ClaimBuster	6757	The mission is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	6758	And so the best indication about when we can bring our troops home -- which I really want to do, but I don't want to do so for the sake of bringing them home; I want to do so because we've achieved an objective -- is to see the Iraqis perform and to see the Iraqis step up and take responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	6759	That's the most noble thing that anybody can do.	0
ClaimBuster	6760	We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	6761	Because he will not withdraw, because he's committed to these islands, because we've been unable to persuade him to withdraw, we are in a very difficult position.	0
ClaimBuster	6762	Now, my defense secretary is going to have a lot to do with those decisions, but it's going to be the President who's going to have to ultimately decide before that budget goes to the Congress what weapons systems are going to go and what are going to stay.	0
ClaimBuster	6763	Governor Carter again is talking in broad generalities.	1
ClaimBuster	6764	Mr. Carter had also promised that he would not use unemployment as a tool to fight against inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	6765	So seventy percent of our debt is five years or less.	1
ClaimBuster	6766	They may - are not my style.	0
ClaimBuster	6767	My friends, what we have to do with Medicare is have a commission, have the smartest people in America come together, come up with recommendations, and then, like the base-closing commission idea we had, then we should have Congress vote up or down.	0
ClaimBuster	6768	I don't know how you can govern in this country when you look at New York City and you see that 50 percent of the black males there are unemployed, when you see 40 percent of Hispanic children -- of black children in some cities -- dropping out of high school.	1
ClaimBuster	6769	That is what I have tried to do successfully by keeping our country at peace.	0
ClaimBuster	6770	And why do I want to bring rates down, and at the same time lower exemptions and deductions, particularly for people at the high end?	0
ClaimBuster	6771	And it's all covered in my budget from -- the plans that I've laid out -- from raising taxes on families with incomes above $200,000 and asking foreign corporations to pay the same tax that American corporations do on the same income, from $140 billion in budget cuts, including what I think are very prudent cuts in the defense budget.	1
ClaimBuster	6772	And that is because they wanted to choose the school that they thought was best for their children.	0
ClaimBuster	6773	Instead of ballooning the debt and multiplying it four times over, we have seen the debt actually begun to be paid down.	1
ClaimBuster	6774	Thank you, Mr. President, also for being part of this -- this debate.	0
ClaimBuster	6775	That's what a president does.	0
ClaimBuster	6776	Let me talk about North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	6777	Two weeks ago, there was a meeting of the North Atlantic Council, which is the political arm of NATO.	1
ClaimBuster	6778	I will tell you this.	0
ClaimBuster	6779	Now, I like green energy as well, but that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and gas receives.	1
ClaimBuster	6780	Whether it be the establishment of the 9/11 Commission.	0
ClaimBuster	6781	So I want to tell you, we will run a truthful campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	6782	I think it ought to be a top priority.	0
ClaimBuster	6783	Energy we have to deal with today, because you're paying $3.80 here in Nashville for gasoline, and it could go up.	1
ClaimBuster	6784	And there ought to be a consequence when you do carry a gun into a school.	0
ClaimBuster	6785	So I, we're going to do better, and we'll do better still, but this is a commitment I think that all Americans share without regard to party.	0
ClaimBuster	6786	They want to get our edge back in science, and they want a policy headed by the President that helps close this gap that's widening between the United States and Europe and Japan.	0
ClaimBuster	6787	The president hasn't put one nickel, not one nickel into the effort to fix some of our tunnels and bridges and most exposed subway systems.	1
ClaimBuster	6788	Who's the person who has believed that the best thing for America is -- is to have a tax system that is fundamentally fair?	0
ClaimBuster	6789	Bob, I think it's going to be important to just -- I'll respond to these two particular allegations that Senator McCain has made and that have gotten a lot of attention.	0
ClaimBuster	6790	And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.	0
ClaimBuster	6791	Let's take 300 of that billion and go in and buy those home loan mortgages and negotiate with those people in their homes, 11 million homes or more, so that they can afford to pay the mortgage, stay in their home.	0
ClaimBuster	6792	First of all, I accept President Reagan's affirmation of faith.	0
ClaimBuster	6793	I don't think he has to be a dictator.	0
ClaimBuster	6794	And that's about all I can say in a minute.	0
ClaimBuster	6795	And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have.	0
ClaimBuster	6796	The financial system had frozen up.	1
ClaimBuster	6797	Now look, he says Arkansas's a poor state.	1
ClaimBuster	6798	And that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy, because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things that are helping America grow.	0
ClaimBuster	6799	But that can't hide the fact that there are eight million men and women out of work in America today, and two million of those lost their jobs in just the last few months.	1
ClaimBuster	6800	Jim, let me just make a point.	0
ClaimBuster	6801	And I think that perhaps we established a little better understanding.	0
ClaimBuster	6802	My request for this year was $4.9 billion for AIDS -- ten times as much per AIDS victim as per cancer victim.	1
ClaimBuster	6803	When I make a mistake I say I'm sorry.	1
ClaimBuster	6804	We've got declining crime rates, two million fewer people on welfare rolls before welfare reform passed, and a 50 percent increase in child support and a crime bill with 60 death penalties and 100,000 police and the assault weapons ban.	1
ClaimBuster	6805	Well, first of all, I think the first answer this evening suggests exactly what I'm saying.	0
ClaimBuster	6806	In the 1980s, I was working to reform the schools in Arkansas.	1
ClaimBuster	6807	I will balance the budget every year.	0
ClaimBuster	6808	Mr. Nixon comes out of the Republican party.	1
ClaimBuster	6809	Senator McCain mentioned looking at our records.	1
ClaimBuster	6810	Senator McCain, as recently as March, bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator.	1
ClaimBuster	6811	Because when you measure you can ask the question, do they know?	0
ClaimBuster	6812	She knows how to create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	6813	Some of the things that can be done about this is a change in the rate structure of electric power companies.	0
ClaimBuster	6814	Governor Romney says, we should replace it, I'm just going to repeal it, but -- but we can replace it with something.	1
ClaimBuster	6815	Listen, we'll do everything we can to protect the homeland.	0
ClaimBuster	6816	First of all, the sequester is not something that I've proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	6817	And I think we have a lot of earning back to do.	0
ClaimBuster	6818	We look to Europe uh - to Asia because the struggle is in the underdeveloped world.	0
ClaimBuster	6819	I don't want the talents of any American to go to waste.	0
ClaimBuster	6820	Recognize the legitimacy of those kids that were carrying the Statue of Liberty.	0
ClaimBuster	6821	They pulled out of the nonproliferation agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	6822	I maybe need to get a new accountant.	0
ClaimBuster	6823	Loves his family, cares about his faith.	0
ClaimBuster	6824	I think a great many of them have come out today.	0
ClaimBuster	6825	Indeed, he was on that side virtually throughout all his years in the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	6826	No -- in fact, watching shows, they're reading the papers.	0
ClaimBuster	6827	So I want to do something about that.	0
ClaimBuster	6828	We eliminated two hundred and seventy-eight of them.	1
ClaimBuster	6829	But just tell me now; don't bury until after the election twice.	0
ClaimBuster	6830	It's a question of priorities and values.	0
ClaimBuster	6831	I made some mistakes in appointing people, but I'm not going to name them.	0
ClaimBuster	6832	I would be willing to have another debate this year.	0
ClaimBuster	6833	I've been -- but I'll nevertheless tell you that I think he has not been candid with the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	6834	You look at the poor people who still live in Cuba.	0
ClaimBuster	6835	But with respect to China, China is both an adversary, but also a potential partner in the international community if it's following the rules.	0
ClaimBuster	6836	I think I know the - the uh capabilities and limitations of atomic power.	0
ClaimBuster	6837	But if you take it in numbers of dollars instead of percentage, yes, you could say, well, that person got 10 times as much as this other person.	1
ClaimBuster	6838	I think the matter is settled once and for all.	0
ClaimBuster	6839	And I can see why you feel that cynicism and mistrust, because the system in Washington is broken.	0
ClaimBuster	6840	China's been cheating over the years.	1
ClaimBuster	6841	About two percent of our population of white people are - is illiterate, ten per cent of our colored population.	1
ClaimBuster	6842	Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS?	0
ClaimBuster	6843	Here is one place where I think that our program does a better job than his.	0
ClaimBuster	6844	I said before, watch Ukraine.	1
ClaimBuster	6845	You know, my father came from Kenya.	1
ClaimBuster	6846	That's not in my value system, and certainly not so that the wealthiest people in America can walk away with another tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	6847	And yet this man, the governor, equated the President to a rotting fish.	0
ClaimBuster	6848	I do not suggest that Chiang Kai-shek - and this Administration has been attempting since 1955 to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to lessen his troop commitments.	0
ClaimBuster	6849	Those terrorists had been violating their northern border consistently, and Israel chased them all the way to there.	1
ClaimBuster	6850	We also have capital gains now for people that invest in new small businesses and hold the investment for five years.	1
ClaimBuster	6851	That's the point I made.	0
ClaimBuster	6852	So this is a show me state.	0
ClaimBuster	6853	And I am not at all convinced that he was that far out of line with his people or that they wanted that to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	6854	She is -- she took on a governor who was a member of her own party when she ran for governor.	1
ClaimBuster	6855	We never would have got there if we had gone for the nuclear freeze crowd; we never would have got there if we had listened to those that wanted to cut defense spending.	0
ClaimBuster	6856	They're much better protected today than they were when I was the governor of Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	6857	That's something that the next treasury secretary is going to have to work on.	0
ClaimBuster	6858	Well, first of all, you know, he made that remark about Senator D'Amato.	1
ClaimBuster	6859	And good management in preserving the peace requires that we control the events and try to intercept before they become a crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	6860	And we have General Flynn.	1
ClaimBuster	6861	That's why Senator Hagel, Republican, says, you know: beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing, in the zone of dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	6862	We shouldn't be doing any favors for North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	6863	And so we're going to have to remain helpful in encouraging Pakistan to move towards a more stable government and rebuild the relationship with us.	0
ClaimBuster	6864	I think that has to be a part of a candidate for president or being president.	0
ClaimBuster	6865	"And ironically, if you repeal Obamacare, and I have become fond of this term, ""Obamacare,"" if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care."	1
ClaimBuster	6866	That's why we've got to make sure that we've got the best science and research in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	6867	I have kept the faith.	0
ClaimBuster	6868	The world is changing dramatically in how we work and how we live, how we relate to each other, huge changes.	0
ClaimBuster	6869	And in so doing, at the same time, we built a new breed of human called an American - a proud, an independent., and a most compassionate individual, for the most part.	0
ClaimBuster	6870	For those of you making up your mind, I would be honored to have your support.	0
ClaimBuster	6871	Now, as far as my position then is concerned, it is exactly opposite to the Senator's.	0
ClaimBuster	6872	And FEMA has been a major flagship project of our reinventing government efforts.	1
ClaimBuster	6873	Warren Buffett took a massive deduction.	1
ClaimBuster	6874	But we also want our education to be free of federal control.	0
ClaimBuster	6875	And that's why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button.	1
ClaimBuster	6876	Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.	1
ClaimBuster	6877	I think if we act effectively, if we stabilize the housing market -- which I believe we can, if we go out and buy up these bad loans, so that people can have a new mortgage at the new value of their home -- I think if we get rid of the cronyism and special interest influence in Washington so we can act more effectively.	0
ClaimBuster	6878	We have a delicate, tight-wire walk that we must go through at the present time to make sure that we do not cozy up to tyrants, to make sure that they don't get the impression that they can suppress their people.	0
ClaimBuster	6879	Well, again, I'm running on the record.	0
ClaimBuster	6880	Her tax plan is a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	6881	So we just have a different theory.	0
ClaimBuster	6882	You'll help prevent unwanted children, unwanted pregnancies.	0
ClaimBuster	6883	Did our administration push for the total training of Iraq?	0
ClaimBuster	6884	You were promised that Medicare would be reformed, and that Social Security would be reformed.	1
ClaimBuster	6885	And I would agree that integrity is not a Republican or a Democratic issue; it's an American issue.	0
ClaimBuster	6886	Nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	6887	Secondly, he said -- my opponent said where he worked to put sanctions on Iran -- we've already sanctioned Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	6888	But I believe that my plan is better than Senator Dole's ill-advised $550 billion scheme which I'll say again will blow a hole in the deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	6889	There isn't any doubt about that, number one.	0
ClaimBuster	6890	We are killing -- absolutely killing our energy business in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	6891	In Northern Ireland, in the Middle East we are better off than we were four years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	6892	Those listening to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	6893	I believe we ought to have foreign aid, but I don't think we ought to just have foreign aid for the sake of foreign aid.	0
ClaimBuster	6894	The governor will not put Medicare in a lockbox.	0
ClaimBuster	6895	And an economy with 7.8 percent unemployment is not a real strong economy.	0
ClaimBuster	6896	Despite all that, I was able to go to the best schools on earth and I was able to succeed in a way that I could not have succeeded anywhere else in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	6897	First of all, he made the misjudgment of saying to America that he was going to build a true alliance, that he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through the inspections.	1
ClaimBuster	6898	But the important -- I'd like to tell you, two Fourths of July ago I was in Baghdad.	1
ClaimBuster	6899	But there's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms.	0
ClaimBuster	6900	The American people want this environment protected.	0
ClaimBuster	6901	And that's hopeful, and that's positive.	0
ClaimBuster	6902	We're beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	6903	And we don't have enough troops there.	0
ClaimBuster	6904	Right this very minute we're sending supplies in to help these little starving kids in Somalia.	1
ClaimBuster	6905	And hard-pressed states right now can't all do that.	0
ClaimBuster	6906	It also is with respect to women, it's with respect to other efforts to try to reach out and be inclusive in our country.	0
ClaimBuster	6907	And there's no question but that Obamacare has been an extraordinary deterrent to enterprises of all kinds hiring people.	0
ClaimBuster	6908	And as president, I am committed to changing that.	0
ClaimBuster	6909	"There's a great passage of the Bible that says, ""What does it mean, my brother, to say you have faith if there are no deeds?"	1
ClaimBuster	6910	But to try, as occurred in the case that you mentioned - that specific case - to try to tell the parishioners of any church, of any denomination, how they should vote, or for whom they should vote, I think violates the principle of separation of church and state.	0
ClaimBuster	6911	Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that's really what's going to be -- that will happen.	0
ClaimBuster	6912	But because the leadership of this government did not pursue wise policies, we have been humiliated, and our opponents are stronger.	0
ClaimBuster	6913	We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	6914	I think I should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website.	0
ClaimBuster	6915	And now the federal government has become the world's greatest slum landlord.	0
ClaimBuster	6916	And we've put unprecedented trade pressure on China.	0
ClaimBuster	6917	But there are a lot of parents who feel like everything is going well in their child's school, and all of a sudden they wake up and realize that wait a minute, standards aren't being met.	0
ClaimBuster	6918	I've been talking about getting a capital gains cut forever, and his friends in Congress have been telling me that's a tax break for the rich.	0
ClaimBuster	6919	I'm not looking at anything now.	1
ClaimBuster	6920	Mr. Herter has said these islands are indefensible.	1
ClaimBuster	6921	We received the support first of the Administration and then not, and we were defeated by one vote in the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	6922	The bill finally came out at the end of the 1999 session.	1
ClaimBuster	6923	They were completely beyond the pale of the law, and I signed the Helms-Burton legislation.	1
ClaimBuster	6924	Mr. Mondale, could I ask you to address the question of nuclear strategy then?	0
ClaimBuster	6925	I didn't in the first debate, and I'm going to try not to in this debate, because I'd like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.	0
ClaimBuster	6926	I think I'm right because I believe that we must have a consistent foreign policy, a strong America, and a strong economy.	0
ClaimBuster	6927	And I do have a sad note tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	6928	And if Israel is attacked, America will stand with Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	6929	One's got a good job, one's studying to be a doctor.	0
ClaimBuster	6930	The next president of the United States is not going to have to address the issue as to whether we went into Iraq or not.	0
ClaimBuster	6931	He says he's learned how to match unemployment with inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	6932	As a matter of fact, I believe every one of those standards is essential to the exercise of power by this country.	0
ClaimBuster	6933	Both parties have foreign lobbyists on leaves in key roles in their campaigns.	1
ClaimBuster	6934	A lot of people ought to deserve credit, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	6935	I want to be the commander in chief of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	6936	When they don't pay their taxes, the average American pays the taxes for them.	0
ClaimBuster	6937	We've got the highest inflation we've had in twenty-five years right now, except under this administration, and that was fifty years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	6938	There is a ravenous demand for them overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	6939	Let me remind you it was a Democratic tax increase, and I didn't want to do it and I went along with it.	1
ClaimBuster	6940	And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama.	1
ClaimBuster	6941	Lloyd Bentsen and I are optimists, and so are the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	6942	And the CBO said -- that's the Congressional Budget Office; it's bipartisan -- they said that there would have to be a cut in benefits of 25 percent to 40 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	6943	I know you talked about it on the Jim, with Jim Lehrer on the PBS show.	1
ClaimBuster	6944	The bottom line is, we went in there alone.	1
ClaimBuster	6945	I think also what you need to think about is not the immediate, but what about Medicare?	0
ClaimBuster	6946	We have a commission on campaign finance reform.	1
ClaimBuster	6947	I believe the way to get the deficit down is to control the growth of mandatory spending programs, and not raise taxes on the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	6948	So long as people have input.	0
ClaimBuster	6949	Values begin at the top, in the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	6950	But I have also worked hard to give people a chance to prove that they are qualified.	0
ClaimBuster	6951	In uh - January of 1975 he asked for a tax change: a $5.6 billion increase on low-and-middle-income private individuals, a six and a half billion dollar decrease on the corporations and the special interests.	1
ClaimBuster	6952	Senator Dole led the opposition to it.	1
ClaimBuster	6953	And I don't see any improvement in the performance of the Congress under the present leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	6954	And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.	1
ClaimBuster	6955	It's going to cost more money, and growth will help us to win that battle.	0
ClaimBuster	6956	There is no way of anticipating what may happen.	0
ClaimBuster	6957	I went into the Olympics that was out of balance, and we got it on balance, and made a success there.	1
ClaimBuster	6958	I want you to hear a problem weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got here in the USA.	0
ClaimBuster	6959	I am concerned about what that does to our future.	0
ClaimBuster	6960	People didn't want to touch it for fear of getting hurt politically.	0
ClaimBuster	6961	The net result is this administration, and during my time as the president for the next four years, we will continue to move for normalization of relations in the traditional sense, and we will insist that the disputes between Taiwan and the People's Republic be settled peacefully, as was agreed in the Shanghai Communique, of 1972.	0
ClaimBuster	6962	A President must not only assure that we're tough, but we must also be wise and smart in the exercise of that power.	0
ClaimBuster	6963	That's the discipline we need, and I'm working for that -- to protect the American taxpayer against the big spenders.	1
ClaimBuster	6964	And the average citizen out here is just working hard every day.	0
ClaimBuster	6965	Now, my balanced budget plan adds ten years to the life of the Medicare trust fund, ten years.	1
ClaimBuster	6966	As president of the United States, I want to assure you, I've got a pen.	0
ClaimBuster	6967	But I could give you a list of banks, I would -- if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks.	0
ClaimBuster	6968	But it has fallen from the -- from any standpoint.	0
ClaimBuster	6969	I believe it does meet the test.	0
ClaimBuster	6970	I want to use a scalpel so that people who need help are getting help and those of us, like myself and Senator McCain, who don't need help, aren't getting it.	0
ClaimBuster	6971	Well of course they add up.	0
ClaimBuster	6972	All over this country, they cannot even buy medicine.	0
ClaimBuster	6973	Now, I voted the way I voted because I saw that he had the policy wrong and I wanted accountability.	0
ClaimBuster	6974	Where we don't have very much money at the Federal level to spend on education, we ought to spend it helping the 90 percent of the kids that we can help.	0
ClaimBuster	6975	Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I've laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.	1
ClaimBuster	6976	I don't want to use food as a diplomatic weapon from this point forward.	0
ClaimBuster	6977	But this is a way to make sure people are actually involved with the decision-making process on health care.	1
ClaimBuster	6978	"Mr. Lodge, on ""Meet the Press"" a month ago, said if there was ever a case when we did not have law an our side it was in the U-2 incident."	1
ClaimBuster	6979	And so I would say that in all of these proposals Senator Kennedy has made, they will result in one of two things: either he has to raise taxes or he has to unbalance the budget.	0
ClaimBuster	6980	But I do think there are flexible ways to solve some of the pressing problems, particularly that affect our children.	0
ClaimBuster	6981	In 1980, President Reagan called you a liberal for voting for Federal gun control.	1
ClaimBuster	6982	But if you're a younger worker, if you're younger, you better hope this country thinks differently, otherwise you're gonna be faced with huge payroll taxes or reduced benefits.	0
ClaimBuster	6983	The Patriot Act is vital, by the way.	0
ClaimBuster	6984	There was a right way to disarm him and a wrong way.	0
ClaimBuster	6985	We cannot be strong militarily when we're teeter-tottering on top of a mountain of debt which has been created in the past eight years.	0
ClaimBuster	6986	Of course we're after Saddam Hussein -- I mean bin Laden.	1
ClaimBuster	6987	The time -- the time...	0
ClaimBuster	6988	But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	6989	Look at the INF treaty.	0
ClaimBuster	6990	I think the Wall Street Journal uh reported not too long ago they have a hundred and twelve public relations experts working for the Federal Energy Agency to try to justify to the American people its own existence.	1
ClaimBuster	6991	Now, we've got to make sure that we do it in a smart way and a comprehensive way, and we make the legal system better.	0
ClaimBuster	6992	They say, what do we need this for?	0
ClaimBuster	6993	But I think that now is the time to heal our country after the Vietnam War and I think that what the people are concerned about is not the - uh pardon or the amnesty of uh - those who evaded the draft, but - but whether or not our crime system is - is fair.	0
ClaimBuster	6994	Then his budget that he passed along with Speaker Gingrich cut Medicare $270 billion, more than was necessary to repair the Medicare trust fund.	1
ClaimBuster	6995	I've known him for 35 years.	1
ClaimBuster	6996	Number two, let's look at history.	0
ClaimBuster	6997	It's not an accurate one.	0
ClaimBuster	6998	And I embarked on an effort to resolve the POW-MIA issue, which we did in a bipartisan fashion, and then I worked on normalization of relations between our two countries so that our veterans could come all the way home.	1
ClaimBuster	6999	People tell me that when the health-care field is fully integrated with information technology, it'll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system.	0
ClaimBuster	7000	He's been the head of the Committee on Government Contracts that's carried out two cases, both in the District of Columbia.	1
ClaimBuster	7001	This is uh - not compatible with the purpose of our nation.	0
ClaimBuster	7002	The road to war is always paved with good intentions.	0
ClaimBuster	7003	Are we doing better in anti-terrorism?	0
ClaimBuster	7004	Let me talk about tax cuts one more time.	0
ClaimBuster	7005	They're not going to follow somebody whose core convictions keep changing because of politics in America.	0
ClaimBuster	7006	We have to decline, for the first time in modern history, jurisdiction in the World Court because they'll find us guilty of illegal actions.	0
ClaimBuster	7007	We're not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don't make our product anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	7008	A lot of these election-year conversions, the President talks about the drug money, and all the other things, all this antismoking campaign all happened in 1996.	1
ClaimBuster	7009	Anybody that says America has been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling in America.	0
ClaimBuster	7010	I haven't heard a big difference in the last few exchanges.	0
ClaimBuster	7011	Maybe we can work that out.	0
ClaimBuster	7012	Uh - I began campaigning uh - twenty-two months ago.	1
ClaimBuster	7013	We passed two very forward-looking civil rights bills.	1
ClaimBuster	7014	You have ancient ethnic rivalries that have cropped up as Yugoslavia's dissolved or getting dissolved, and it isn't going to be solved by sending in the 82nd Airborne, and I'm not going to do that as commander-in-chief.	0
ClaimBuster	7015	I've had a record of bringing people from all walks of life into my administration, and my administration is better off for it in Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	7016	I believe we ought to make the system work better.	0
ClaimBuster	7017	Oh, yeah, they're making -- I mean, they are outsmarting -- look, you're not there, you might be involved in that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	7018	You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami.	0
ClaimBuster	7019	Well, Theresa (ph), thank you.	0
ClaimBuster	7020	And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want.	0
ClaimBuster	7021	Ultimately, we're going to have to make some decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	7022	And the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies.	0
ClaimBuster	7023	It's because I care about education for all of our kids.	0
ClaimBuster	7024	The middle-class has been crushed over the last four years, and jobs have been too scarce.	1
ClaimBuster	7025	And that's something I want to lead, something we haven't had over the course of the past many years, even though the Vice President has been at least allegedly in charge of that war.	0
ClaimBuster	7026	Believe me, he's not a happy camper.	0
ClaimBuster	7027	I think that one of the problems that we have faced in the world is that we are so much more powerful than any single nation has been in relationship to the rest of the world than at any time in history, that I know about, anyway.	0
ClaimBuster	7028	So the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs.	0
ClaimBuster	7029	If you are part of the -- of the bottom 20% or so of wage earners, then you will get an expanded earned income tax credit.	1
ClaimBuster	7030	49th for women with health care, and 50th for families with health care.	1
ClaimBuster	7031	This goes to our survival.	0
ClaimBuster	7032	I think there ought to be parental notification laws.	0
ClaimBuster	7033	I will do more for African-Americans and Latinos than she can ever do in 10 lifetimes.	0
ClaimBuster	7034	I want to hold the line on taxes, and keep this the longest expansion in modern history going until everybody in America benefits.	0
ClaimBuster	7035	...I indicated that you failed to put in place a status...	1
ClaimBuster	7036	Well, this has been a tough campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	7037	And I consider that to be a very good trait.	0
ClaimBuster	7038	Well, where do you want me to begin?	0
ClaimBuster	7039	There's a lot of really good people working hard to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	7040	Well, Andrea, we've just had another example of why the Vice President's mathematics just don't add up.	0
ClaimBuster	7041	I want to change the character of the presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	7042	And we have to recognize that the way they've been behaving lately demands a sharp response from the international community and our allies.	0
ClaimBuster	7043	Abraham Lincoln was a great president of all the people; but he was selected by his party at a key time in history because his party stood for something.	0
ClaimBuster	7044	The president's path means 20 million people out of work struggling for a good job.	1
ClaimBuster	7045	Whether there was some misleading, or instead whether we just didn't know what happened, you have to ask yourself why didn't we know five days later when the ambassador to the United Nations went on TV to say that this was a demonstration.	0
ClaimBuster	7046	There were a number of things in there that weakened that bill.	0
ClaimBuster	7047	Actually what I've said, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	7048	But our country is innately very strong.	0
ClaimBuster	7049	It costs California taxpayers 3 billion dollars a year.	1
ClaimBuster	7050	Opening up more trade, particularly in Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	7051	Tonight, as Americans, you have a choice.	0
ClaimBuster	7052	And Mr. President, it's good to be with you again.	0
ClaimBuster	7053	And I think you get a certain arrogance, bureaucratic arrogance, if people stay there too long.	0
ClaimBuster	7054	I was in Houston on Tuesday meeting with a group of good citizens, working citizens.	1
ClaimBuster	7055	First, there's some who should be buying health care who choose not to.	0
ClaimBuster	7056	Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our allies.	0
ClaimBuster	7057	And the answer is I don't believe people think that's the case --	0
ClaimBuster	7058	But the Republican leadership of the House and Senate won't even let us have a vote on it.	0
ClaimBuster	7059	I've worked hard to create good jobs and to educate people.	0
ClaimBuster	7060	I've got an obligation to make sure our government does everything we can to protect you.	0
ClaimBuster	7061	He was nominated by it.	1
ClaimBuster	7062	And this idea of unleashing a whole bunch-an army, a conventional force army, of IRS agents into everybody's kitchen I mean, he's against most defense matters, and now he wants to get an army of JRS auditors going out there.	0
ClaimBuster	7063	I want to restore a meaningful safety net.	0
ClaimBuster	7064	Yes, I have seen figures that indicate that perhaps as of September, 1980 - this very month - that there is a shortage of about 104,000 in the ranks between E-4 and E-9.	1
ClaimBuster	7065	I know what it takes to bring them back, and I'm going to do that, and make sure that when you graduate -- when do you graduate?	0
ClaimBuster	7066	I have met with the legislative leaders.	1
ClaimBuster	7067	As a result, we have saved over $9 billion in federal expenditures.	1
ClaimBuster	7068	It's a tall order, but I've been running against the odds for a long time and, again, I'm honored to be here this evening.	0
ClaimBuster	7069	Well, here's the problem with it: It sounds very good, but there's a reason that 500 economists, including seven Nobel prize winners and business periodicals like Business Week, and even Senator Dole's friends, Senator Warren Rudman, former Republican senator from New Hampshire, says it's not a practical program.	1
ClaimBuster	7070	Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts.	1
ClaimBuster	7071	I've learned not to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	7072	And so I'll make the appeal on a wide array of issues.	0
ClaimBuster	7073	I think the reason to support the death penalty is because it saves other people's lives.	0
ClaimBuster	7074	It stripped us of manufacturing jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	7075	In Iraq, no doubt about it, it's tough.	0
ClaimBuster	7076	But now I think there have been a couple of instances where the Burger Court has made technical rulings where an obviously guilty person was later found to be guilty.	1
ClaimBuster	7077	Having a hemisphere that is free for trade and peaceful is in our nation's interests.	0
ClaimBuster	7078	We are not going to spend the billions and trillions that Mr. Bush wants to spend on Star Wars.	0
ClaimBuster	7079	There is very little difference in the budget that I proposed and the Republican budget over the next six-year period.	1
ClaimBuster	7080	I think as you make the case, the American people will increasingly come to our cause.	0
ClaimBuster	7081	We're backing up at every way we possibly can.	0
ClaimBuster	7082	We have done a lot more, and I hope we get a chance to talk about it.	0
ClaimBuster	7083	I want to get America's economy going again.	0
ClaimBuster	7084	I don't think it should be used as a piggy bank for other programs.	0
ClaimBuster	7085	I have a plan to lower the cost of health care for you.	0
ClaimBuster	7086	When FDR established Social Security, they didn't call them IOUs, they called it the full faith and credit of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	7087	And they cry when they see what's happened.	0
ClaimBuster	7088	Many people are coming to this country for economic reasons.	1
ClaimBuster	7089	They were just shuffling too many kids through the system, year after year, grade after grade, without learning the basics.	0
ClaimBuster	7090	That's not what we want.	0
ClaimBuster	7091	I simply think that when we are confronting a budget deficit this year - and this fiscal year will end in about 10 days, and we are confronted with the possibility of a deficit of $60 billion, perhaps as much as $63 billion - that that simply would be irresponsible.	1
ClaimBuster	7092	It has some very elderly leaders that will not be around too much longer.	0
ClaimBuster	7093	And I have a responsibility to correct him every time he misstates the case; and I intend to continue to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	7094	But as we respect someone's rights, and as we profess tolerance, we shouldn't change -- or have to change -- our basic views on the sanctity of marriage.	0
ClaimBuster	7095	I think the lessons of Iraq are very clear that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict.	0
ClaimBuster	7096	Donald wants to tear up our alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	7097	I believe that when we examine the Democratic platform, when we examine the proposals that he has discussed tonight, when we compare them with the proposals that I have made, that these proposals that he makes would not result in greater growth for this country than would be the case if we followed the programs that I have advocated.	0
ClaimBuster	7098	Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989.	0
ClaimBuster	7099	There's no way to get the answer to a question.	0
ClaimBuster	7100	If it ever becomes necessary, and is wise economically and essential to our security, I would have no hesitancy in suggesting a tax increase or any other policy which would defend the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	7101	No, but he's for weakening it.	0
ClaimBuster	7102	Or you can cut his allowance and achieve the same end much quicker.	0
ClaimBuster	7103	Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, he is the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said over his dead body before it gets renewed without being thoroughly rechecked.	1
ClaimBuster	7104	In a lot of places, our police are outgunned.	1
ClaimBuster	7105	I spent a lot of time talking to military families as well as military members all over the world and in bases all across the United States, and I became convinced after talking to the families and the personnel in uniform that we needed to not only have the pay raise but we needed to invest more in child care, housing, and other things to support families, especially when there are longer deployments because of the downsizing of the military.	1
ClaimBuster	7106	"Now, Governor Romney just said, you know he wants to help those young people too, but during the Republican primary, he said, ""I will veto the DREAM Act"", that would allow these young people to have access."""	1
ClaimBuster	7107	It would have been a wider war, which the United States of America might have had to come back.	0
ClaimBuster	7108	Already just today the members of his political party said that they were going to ignore the orders of the new president of Serbia, and that they question his legitimacy, and he's still going to try to be actively involved.	1
ClaimBuster	7109	I found it to be an issue in trying to defend my tax relief package.	0
ClaimBuster	7110	In fact, he first didn't even want to do that.	1
ClaimBuster	7111	You can see it in this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	7112	Let's not raise anybody's taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	7113	Uh - First of all, we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference.	0
ClaimBuster	7114	Child safety trigger locks on a mandatory basis, and others.	0
ClaimBuster	7115	You can't do it as president: you can't have a pattern of one side of the issue one day and another the next.	0
ClaimBuster	7116	Why have there been these safety violations?	0
ClaimBuster	7117	He says, Ã¢â€°Â¥Well, let's concede that the administration has been doing business with Noriega.	1
ClaimBuster	7118	Now, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work.	1
ClaimBuster	7119	We have no growth in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	7120	I believe we have to get ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	7121	And I say that because from the very beginning, the president in his campaign four years ago, said he would meet with all the world's worst actors in his first year, he'd sit down with Chavez and Kim Jong-il, with Castro and President Ahmadinejad of Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	7122	Well, thank you, Terry (ph).	0
ClaimBuster	7123	The Office of Small Business, under Mr. Kobelinski, has a very massive program trying to help the black community.	1
ClaimBuster	7124	I have advocated and taken on the special interests, whether they be the big money people by reaching across the aisle and working with Senator Feingold on campaign finance reform, whether it being a variety of other issues, working with Senator Lieberman on trying to address climate change.	1
ClaimBuster	7125	If I'm entrusted with the presidency, I will help parents and strengthen families because, you know, if we have prosperity that grows and grows, we still won't be successful unless we strengthen families by, for example, ensuring that children can always go to schools that are safe.	0
ClaimBuster	7126	But they'll tell you his prescription wasn't going to work.	0
ClaimBuster	7127	And I think it's important for us to make college affordable.	0
ClaimBuster	7128	It's a big human problem and a devastating economic problem for America, and I'm going to send a plan to do this within the first 100 days of my presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	7129	We're working right now in trying to be of help in southern Africa with regard to the independence of Namibia and the removal of the Cuban surrogates, the thousands of them, from Angola.	1
ClaimBuster	7130	I've argued that we should fully funded it.	1
ClaimBuster	7131	Minority ownership of businesses are up, because we created an environment for the entrepreneurial spirit to be strong.	1
ClaimBuster	7132	But I also believe that for far too long, certainly during the course of the Bush administration with the support of Senator McCain, the attitude has been that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	7133	And in conference -- we stayed with them in conference all the way to where even Senator Simpson did not want the bill in the manner in which it would come out of the conference committee.	1
ClaimBuster	7134	I've worked on that long and hard.	1
ClaimBuster	7135	So I believe that this election has become in part so -- so conflict-oriented, so intense because there's a lot at stake.	0
ClaimBuster	7136	Mr. Howe, Mr. Vice President.	0
ClaimBuster	7137	I'm going to be a president who believes in science.	0
ClaimBuster	7138	It will come from the pockets of the people who are living in those very areas.	0
ClaimBuster	7139	In February he said we had the best economy in Ã‚ 30 years, just February.	1
ClaimBuster	7140	I am in favor of leaving the tax rates alone and reducing the tax burden on middle-income Americans by doubling your tax exemption for every child from $3,500 to $7,000.	0
ClaimBuster	7141	My friends, the last president to raise taxes during tough economic times was Herbert Hoover, and he practiced protectionism as well, which I'm sure we'll get to at some point.	1
ClaimBuster	7142	Now I think as far as Quemoy and Matsu are concerned, that the question is not these two little pieces of real estate - they are unimportant.	0
ClaimBuster	7143	We have a government that doesn't work.	0
ClaimBuster	7144	As I said earlier, they don't have any ideas.	0
ClaimBuster	7145	And on that basis and that basis alone, we make a decision on every issue.	0
ClaimBuster	7146	I intend to do the same thing if I'm elected president.	0
ClaimBuster	7147	That's why what I have put forward doesn't add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher-paying jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	7148	But we also have to develop clean energy technologies that will allow us to cut our exports in half by 2020.	0
ClaimBuster	7149	I think that afterschool money ought to be available for faith-based programs and charitable programs that exist because somebody has heard the call to love a neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself.	0
ClaimBuster	7150	We're not going to eliminate everybody who is mentally disturbed and we have got to make sure they don't get weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	7151	I won't, I never repeat what I've talked to the President about.	0
ClaimBuster	7152	There is a crime bill that, lamentably, was blocked from passage once again, mostly by Republicans in the US Senate, which would have addressed some of these problems.	1
ClaimBuster	7153	The Cold War is over.	1
ClaimBuster	7154	We used to -- you know, we have a goal there for minority set-aside programs, to try to encourage ownership in the country.	1
ClaimBuster	7155	And I believe the federal government must say that if you receive any money, any money from the federal government for disadvantaged children, for example, you must show us whether or not the children are learning.	0
ClaimBuster	7156	And I want to keep it alive in child care and in other entitlements.	0
ClaimBuster	7157	Not the one we've been on, not the one the president describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich.	0
ClaimBuster	7158	If you look at the cost of not keeping the peace in Europe, it would be exorbitant.	0
ClaimBuster	7159	That's why we need to be firm and resolved in bringing them to justice.	0
ClaimBuster	7160	What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote.	1
ClaimBuster	7161	Look, Governor Bush, you have attacked my character and credibility and I am not going to respond in kind.	0
ClaimBuster	7162	I think the contracting business in government can help.	0
ClaimBuster	7163	And that's exactly the kind of top-down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy that's striving for everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	7164	If wind, water or fire destroyed them, we built them again.	0
ClaimBuster	7165	Here we have our own secretary of state who has had to apologize to the world for the presentation he made to the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	7166	The Republican party has produced McKinley and Harding, Coolidge, Dewey, and Landon.	1
ClaimBuster	7167	The people, some way, have always understood that at a particular time a certain man was the one the country needed.	0
ClaimBuster	7168	We have a fundamental difference, approach on agriculture.	0
ClaimBuster	7169	So there's no doubt that we have a long way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	7170	So we've got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	7171	I don't have any foreign lobbyists on leave in my campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	7172	If he, that's what he said, he's not right about that.	1
ClaimBuster	7173	After all, when you amend the Constitution, state legislatures must participate in the ratification of the Constitution.	1
ClaimBuster	7174	I mean, we've got big economic problems, but we are not coming apart at the seams; we're ready for a recovery.	0
ClaimBuster	7175	I notice that his task force that is working for his future plans had some of their ideas revealed in The Wall Street Journal this week.	1
ClaimBuster	7176	If you vote the other way, you will be lucky to save it.	0
ClaimBuster	7177	Throughout my career in public service, I have fought for the working men and women of this country, middle-class families.	1
ClaimBuster	7178	And so that's what I will do.	0
ClaimBuster	7179	Now, the three things they try to say I've changed position on are the Patriot Act; I haven't.	1
ClaimBuster	7180	And, Tom, if -- if we're going to go back and forth, I then -- I'd like to have equal time to go -- to respond to...	0
ClaimBuster	7181	And we have maintained the sanctions.	1
ClaimBuster	7182	But there's also the issue of responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	7183	And that's very important to the economy, but I think we want to make certain.	0
ClaimBuster	7184	And the notion that we would sit with Ahmadinejad and not say anything while he's spewing his nonsense and his vile comments is ridiculous.	0
ClaimBuster	7185	The president said he was going to build a true coalition, exhaust the remedies of the U.N. and go to war as a last resort.	1
ClaimBuster	7186	What is needed is a study that I have proposed by a task force of experts to look into this entire problem as to how it can be reformed and made actuarially sound, but with the premise that no one presently dependent on Social Security is going to have the rug pulled out from under them and not get their check.	0
ClaimBuster	7187	The deficit is the result of excessive government spending.	1
ClaimBuster	7188	I hope that they put the troops on the ground so that we can withdraw our troops and focus our military on fighting and winning war.	0
ClaimBuster	7189	My plan would give students a dollar-for-dollar reduction for the cost of a typical community college tuition.	0
ClaimBuster	7190	So he would have been alive today.	0
ClaimBuster	7191	Attacking me is not talking about how we're going to deal with the challenges that exist in the Middle East, and take advantage of the opportunity there, and stem the tide of this violence.	0
ClaimBuster	7192	This is part of the choice in this election.	0
ClaimBuster	7193	I believe that we need to educate better and retrain better.	0
ClaimBuster	7194	The federal government has been reduced in size by more than 300,000 people.	1
ClaimBuster	7195	Are your children getting a better education.	0
ClaimBuster	7196	The president's got another proposal to require them to pay $400 a year more for the next 5 years.	1
ClaimBuster	7197	Sure, there's more work to do.	0
ClaimBuster	7198	Yes, we can be safe and secure, if we stay on the offense against the terrorists and if we spread freedom and liberty around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	7199	In the last month, we've had a net loss of one hundred and sixty-three thousand jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	7200	We've got 20 million names on a computer in Washington, D.C. of people who should not have guns.	1
ClaimBuster	7201	Yes, it was announced that the uh - GNP real growth in the third quarter was at 4 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	7202	"And when I hear Governor Romney say he's a big coal guy, I mean, keep in mind, when -- Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts, you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, ""This plant kills,"" and took great pride in shutting it down."	1
ClaimBuster	7203	But I suggest that we understand that those are going to be additional costs on senior citizens across this country.	0
ClaimBuster	7204	Those 209 Americans last Thursday night in Richmond told us they wanted us to stop talking about each other and start talking about Americans and their problems and their promise, and I think we ought to get back to that.	1
ClaimBuster	7205	I should point out that as far as depletion allowances are concerned, the oil depletion allowance is one that provides eighty percent of all of those involved in depletion, so you're not going to get much from revenue insofar as depletion allowances are concerned, unless you move in the area that he indicated.	1
ClaimBuster	7206	And that's a good thing.	0
ClaimBuster	7207	Let's make it a strength, not a weakness.	0
ClaimBuster	7208	Well, I mentioned Third World debt.	1
ClaimBuster	7209	We're in the serious stages of negotiation with the Soviet Union on the strategic arms control talks.	1
ClaimBuster	7210	If we're going to talk about trips that we've taken -- when I was a candidate for office, first trip I took was to visit our troops.	1
ClaimBuster	7211	One is we've got to have the money to be able to pay for defense, and we've got to manufacture here.	0
ClaimBuster	7212	Nuclear power is safe, and it's clean, and it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	7213	This is a tough campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	7214	Well, one of the very serious things that's happened in our government in recent years, and has continued up until now, is a breakdown in the trust among our people in the [twenty-seven-minute delay]	0
ClaimBuster	7215	Now, my plan for the future, I see a time when we have smaller, smarter government where you don't have to wait in line because you can get services online cheaper, better, faster.	0
ClaimBuster	7216	I am the one that said let's keep the M.F.N.	1
ClaimBuster	7217	"And you know, Senator McCain, I think the ""Straight Talk Express"" lost a wheel on that one."	0
ClaimBuster	7218	But Russia has to make the decision.	0
ClaimBuster	7219	"I can't begin to pay back my student loans."""	0
ClaimBuster	7220	I don't believe in the registration of handguns or the registration of the handgun owner.	0
ClaimBuster	7221	It's the toughest job on Earth, and you must master the facts and insist that things that must be done are done.	0
ClaimBuster	7222	Spending money is one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	7223	That's an area where we're going to have to work with Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	7224	I respect him for showing tonight - for appearing here, and I thank the League of Women Voters for the opportunity that they have given me.	0
ClaimBuster	7225	Let me call your attention to the key word there.	0
ClaimBuster	7226	Well, I definitely think there are differences.	0
ClaimBuster	7227	But nevertheless, they're out there.	0
ClaimBuster	7228	This nation is the most religious nation on Earth -- more people go to church and synagogues than any other nation on Earth -- and it's because we kept the politicians and the state out of the personal exercise of our faith.	1
ClaimBuster	7229	We'll never have a balanced budget, we'll never meet the needs of our people, we'll never control the inflationary spiral, as long as we have seven and a half or eight million people out of work, who are looking for jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	7230	But I don't -- I think you got to look at the integrity and the honor of the people that are being lobbied and those that are lobbyists.	0
ClaimBuster	7231	I think that's part of it.	0
ClaimBuster	7232	To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.	0
ClaimBuster	7233	But the point is, what about his error in voting for the amendment, which was not adopted, and then persisting in it in fifty-nine, persisting in it in the debate.	1
ClaimBuster	7234	And whether this House and Senate, in the next session is Democratic or Republican, if the country will have voted for the candidate for the presidency and for the proposals that he has made, I believe that you will find that the president, if it were a Republican, as it would be in my case, would be able to get his program through that Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	7235	I don't want the federal government paying teachers' salaries directly.	0
ClaimBuster	7236	And the idea that has been suggested that I would liquidate the industry, of course not.	0
ClaimBuster	7237	We don't know what the future's going to bring.	0
ClaimBuster	7238	He voted to violate the budget cap 277 times.	1
ClaimBuster	7239	And the birther lie was a very hurtful one.	0
ClaimBuster	7240	I just want to mention if I could --	0
ClaimBuster	7241	And we not only have uh problems at home but we export those problems overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	7242	I -- of course there's a lot -- look, global warming needs to be taken very seriously, and I take it seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	7243	When you are proud and confident of your strength, you do not get down to the level of Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues.	0
ClaimBuster	7244	And we have got to put our nation back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	7245	Ross, that's a great speech, but it's not quite that simple.	0
ClaimBuster	7246	This is just another lie.	0
ClaimBuster	7247	Japan is going to have a summit for the donors; $14 billion pledged.	1
ClaimBuster	7248	I sit down with the world leaders frequently and talk to them on the phone frequently.	1
ClaimBuster	7249	Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	7250	On a -- on the way that the Iraq War was conducted.	0
ClaimBuster	7251	What matters is something in this person's head says there is not going to be a consequence.	0
ClaimBuster	7252	Number two, we do have to deal with our border so we put more border patrol on the -- any time in history and the flow of undocumented works across the border is actually lower than it's been in 40 years.	1
ClaimBuster	7253	We'll be implementing a missile-defense system relatively quickly.	0
ClaimBuster	7254	We didn't go in until right before the election, similar to what was taking place in 1972, when Mr. Kissinger announced peace is at hand just before the election at that time.	1
ClaimBuster	7255	"We will go with our allies."""	0
ClaimBuster	7256	He's going to tax everybody here to fund his programs.	0
ClaimBuster	7257	Now, all these fellows with thousand-dollar suits and alligator shoes running up and down the halls of Congress that make policy now -- the lobbyists, the PAC guys, the foreign lobbyists, and what-have-you, they'll be over there in the Smithsonian, you know --	0
ClaimBuster	7258	And then we noticed that there was more than one with that same serial number.	1
ClaimBuster	7259	We have a disciplined reduction in the deficit of 50 % over the next 4 years, but first get incentives to invest in this economy, put the American people back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	7260	And, yes, he would have been stronger had we not dealt with him.	0
ClaimBuster	7261	And I do believe that we didn't gain a great deal in the Mideast by bringing three of the four leaders, one refused to come, to Washington D.C.	1
ClaimBuster	7262	By and large it should be local -- the more local, the better.	0
ClaimBuster	7263	The question is the means.	0
ClaimBuster	7264	You can check 10% of that if you want to, in the 1 box, and that 10%, $100, or if you're paying $10,000, whatever it is, $1000, check it off and make the government, make it lower the deficit by that amount.	1
ClaimBuster	7265	But he didn't put in what he promised, and that makes a difference in the lives of our children.	0
ClaimBuster	7266	Neither I nor anybody else, as far a I know, agreed to give him our proxy to say that whatever he did was fine for the workers of this country and for the interests of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	7267	But I do think we need to find out where racial profiling occurs and do something about it and say to the local folks, get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	7268	I am grateful for the chance to reaffirm my commitment to reduce nuclear weapons and, one day, to eliminate them entirely.	0
ClaimBuster	7269	The automobile industry is the number one market for steel.	1
ClaimBuster	7270	So it's not one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	7271	But I hope tonight you will get a better feel of who Bob Dole is and what he's all about.	0
ClaimBuster	7272	If you're a small business, it's a crushing burden.	0
ClaimBuster	7273	It's estimated that 8 million people will go from private insurance to government insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	7274	If you did that you could take away the incumbents' advantage because challengers like me would have a chance to run against incumbents like him for House races and Senate races, and then the voters could make up their own mind without being subject to an unfair fight.	0
ClaimBuster	7275	Every possible diplomatic means was utilized.	0
ClaimBuster	7276	So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly.	1
ClaimBuster	7277	I am -- you know it's really interesting.	0
ClaimBuster	7278	The reason Social Security -- he says it gets 2%.	1
ClaimBuster	7279	Amnesty means that - that you uh - that what you did was right.	0
ClaimBuster	7280	It -- when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that we've created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall?	0
ClaimBuster	7281	We need law and order, but we need justice, too.	0
ClaimBuster	7282	We can't stand pat for the reason that we're in a race, as I've indicated.	0
ClaimBuster	7283	For those of you for me, thanks for your help.	0
ClaimBuster	7284	It's $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public.	0
ClaimBuster	7285	I know exactly what we need to do in Iraq, and my position has been consistent: Saddam Hussein is a threat.	0
ClaimBuster	7286	Israel could not be blamed for that.	0
ClaimBuster	7287	I would say that the people now have the opportunity to evaluate his as against mine and I think both he and I are going to abide by whatever the people decide.	0
ClaimBuster	7288	The point of all this is, this is a struggle in which we're engaged.	0
ClaimBuster	7289	The thing I don't understand about Mr. Bush's approach to this is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do.	0
ClaimBuster	7290	The other day, I just - I'll hasten - I just saw one example.	0
ClaimBuster	7291	Well, I think there are many uh - tests, Mr. Drummond, of prestige.	0
ClaimBuster	7292	We should be playing the leadership role there, not on the ground with military.	0
ClaimBuster	7293	Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact...	0
ClaimBuster	7294	The Shanghai Communique, does say that the differences between the People's Republic on the one hand and Taiwan on the other shall be settled by peaceful means.	1
ClaimBuster	7295	And they are active in countries like -- in regions like Latin America, and Asia, and Africa.	1
ClaimBuster	7296	Well again, if you're somebody thinking about the future, I think it's fair to say that it'll be -- we'll work it out.	0
ClaimBuster	7297	I want to say, everything I ever learned about leadership I learned from a chief petty officer.	1
ClaimBuster	7298	But we have not had the kind of leadership we should have had.	0
ClaimBuster	7299	This is a president who hasn't met with the Black Congressional Caucus.	1
ClaimBuster	7300	And right now I have to tell you I don't think there is any excuse for the interest rates being as high as they are because we have brought inflation down so low.	0
ClaimBuster	7301	We've got five hundred thousand more Americans out of jobs today than were out of work three months ago and since Mr. Ford's been in office two years, we've had a 50 percent increase in unemployment from five million people out of work to two and a half million more people out of work and a total of seven and a half million.	1
ClaimBuster	7302	And we'll care for these young children.	0
ClaimBuster	7303	The best people in a small town will serve on the school board; you get into big cities, it's political patronage, stepping stones -- you get the job, give your relatives a janitor's job at $57,000 a year, more than the teachers make, and with luck they clean the cafeteria once a week.	0
ClaimBuster	7304	How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers?	0
ClaimBuster	7305	We can bridge the gap between imported oil, which is a national security issue, as well as any other, and it will reduce the price of a barrel of oil, because when people know there's a greater supply, then the cost of that will go down.	0
ClaimBuster	7306	I strongly believe we need to have a military presence in the Korean peninsula, not only to keep the peace in the peninsula, but to keep regional stability.	0
ClaimBuster	7307	That kind of thing is not the way to rein in runaway spending in Washington, D.C. That's one of the fundamental differences that Senator Obama and I have.	0
ClaimBuster	7308	The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	7309	And quite often this has been in the very poor people and neighborhoods in the downtown urban centers.	0
ClaimBuster	7310	And we have to vote it up or down, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	7311	I have not spent the last quarter century in pursuit of personal wealth.	1
ClaimBuster	7312	I believe we have to make the right and responsible choices.	0
ClaimBuster	7313	But why start an arms race now?	0
ClaimBuster	7314	Well the conditions I laid out in one of our previous television debates, and it's rather difficult to be much more specific than that.	1
ClaimBuster	7315	Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business.	1
ClaimBuster	7316	Listen, we've got gun laws.	1
ClaimBuster	7317	And the first word you need to say in every city and state, and just draw a line in the sand, is public schools exist for the benefit of the children.	0
ClaimBuster	7318	Although they have been moving faster in growth than we have, we find, for example, today that their total gross national product is only forty-four per cent of our total gross national product.	1
ClaimBuster	7319	There is no greater return to an economy or to a society than an educational system second to none.	0
ClaimBuster	7320	I mean, I sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street known as Trump...	1
ClaimBuster	7321	We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you.	0
ClaimBuster	7322	There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth.	0
ClaimBuster	7323	I take that very seriously, because I do think it's one of the issues we've got to come to grips with.	0
ClaimBuster	7324	We've got 100,000 trained now, 125,000 by the end of this year, 200,000 by the end of next year.	1
ClaimBuster	7325	And my whole concept was to make America great again.	0
ClaimBuster	7326	All of the problems -- the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border.	1
ClaimBuster	7327	I think it's fitting that we're on the campus of a university tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	7328	You've got 99 other senators to correct that mistake, if it is a mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	7329	I'd rather have some jobs left here than just see everything head south, see?	0
ClaimBuster	7330	It's got to be on the timetable of the people that we're trying to bring to the peace table.	0
ClaimBuster	7331	I spend a lot of time in hospitals.	1
ClaimBuster	7332	You know, one of the challenges over the last decade is we've done experiments in nation building in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and we've neglected, for example, developing our own economy, our own energy sectors, our own education system.	1
ClaimBuster	7333	Because you got a big tax increase.	1
ClaimBuster	7334	I want to build on our strengths.	0
ClaimBuster	7335	But it's bad, bad experience.	0
ClaimBuster	7336	And we will start putting together teams to put together--to take all the plans that exist and do something with them.	0
ClaimBuster	7337	We're not moving ahead in education the way we should.	0
ClaimBuster	7338	And so budgets reflect choices.	0
ClaimBuster	7339	I'm not going to, because I think that all of you -- or not everyone, those people that are in those pockets of poverty and haven't caught up, they couldn't answer the way I would want them to -- but I think that most of the people in this country would say, yes, they are better off than they were 4 years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	7340	Remember, there was a trillion dollars in debt before we got here.	1
ClaimBuster	7341	We had to go in there to get Osama bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	7342	I've been a hunter since I was a kid, 12, 13 years old.	1
ClaimBuster	7343	But the fact of it is we're so far away from research that even comes close to that, that the Director of Engineering Research at the Defense Department said to get there we would have to solve eight problems, each of which are more difficult than the atomic bomb and the Manhattan project.	1
ClaimBuster	7344	Now, I said earlier that we are the strongest military, but we need to continue improving readiness and making sure that our military personnel are adequately paid and that the combination of their pay and their benefits and their retirement as veterans is comparable to the stiff competition that's coming in this strong economy from the private sector.	1
ClaimBuster	7345	For every one of you who stood up here and asked a question tonight, I promise you there's a 100,000 Americans who said I wish I could have asked that question.	0
ClaimBuster	7346	We gave them $1.7 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	7347	This is the history of dealing with dictators.	0
ClaimBuster	7348	And there is this pattern that has plagued him in the primaries and now about trying to have it both ways on all these issues.	0
ClaimBuster	7349	We have to make health care affordable and available.	0
ClaimBuster	7350	And the mantle of leadership for the -- promoting the principles of peace has fallen to America.	0
ClaimBuster	7351	And I've been a careful steward of your tax dollars.	0
ClaimBuster	7352	But the people are going to have to make up their mind on this issue.	0
ClaimBuster	7353	And I think it's important to understand what happened here.	0
ClaimBuster	7354	We can meet our destiny - and that destiny to build a land here that will be, for all mankind, a shining city on a hill.	0
ClaimBuster	7355	You know what he did?	0
ClaimBuster	7356	If the wrong guy is put to death, then that's a double tragedy.	0
ClaimBuster	7357	She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler.	1
ClaimBuster	7358	I know the threats that are made against me.	0
ClaimBuster	7359	But if our national security is at stake, if we have allies, if we've tried every other course, if we're sure military action will succeed, and if the costs are proportionate to the benefits, we should get involved.	0
ClaimBuster	7360	It's going to be hard to punish them any worse after they get put to death.	0
ClaimBuster	7361	And that's why I'm introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship.	0
ClaimBuster	7362	I certainly hope it won't.	0
ClaimBuster	7363	And so the fundamental question of this campaign is: Who's going to keep the economy growing so people can work?	0
ClaimBuster	7364	And you know what happens?	0
ClaimBuster	7365	It either gets passed along as increased prices or it gets passed along by people being put out of work so the business can continue to compete.	0
ClaimBuster	7366	Coming out of World War II it made sense.	0
ClaimBuster	7367	Because we've seen this throughout the campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	7368	And then I asked for a bipartisan commission, which I'd asked for from the beginning, to sit down and work out a solution.	1
ClaimBuster	7369	I'm the president that said hey, don't mess with Social Security, and we haven't.	0
ClaimBuster	7370	I will get America working again and see rising take-home pay again, and I'll do it with five simple steps.	0
ClaimBuster	7371	Now, Governor Romney, when you were asked by teachers whether or not this would help the economy grow, you said this isn't going to help the economy grow.	1
ClaimBuster	7372	The catalyst for this housing crisis was the Fannie and Freddie Mae that caused subprime lending situation that now caused the housing market in America to collapse.	1
ClaimBuster	7373	Employment ought to be restored to our people.	0
ClaimBuster	7374	If it is uh true that there will be a $60 billion surplus by fiscal year 1981, rather than spend that money for all the new programs that Governor Carter recommends and endorses, and which are included in the Democratic platform, I think the American taxpayer ought to get an additional tax break - a tax reduction of that magnitude.	0
ClaimBuster	7375	And I'm going to get our allies back to the table.	0
ClaimBuster	7376	I want to see market economies spring up all around the world and to the degree they do, we are succeeding.	0
ClaimBuster	7377	My balanced budget covers mammograms for ladies, women on Medicare and also gives respite care to the million-plus families who have someone with AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s.	1
ClaimBuster	7378	The people that work in Washington, D.C. for the U.S. Congress or the United States senate.	0
ClaimBuster	7379	In Texas you could have unlimited absences to go to livestock shows.	1
ClaimBuster	7380	And that's why the failure of this administration to deal in an effective and a good-faith way with Mexico, with Costa Rica, with the other nations in trying to find a peaceful settlement to the dispute in Central America has undermined our capacity to effectively deal diplomatically in this area as well.	1
ClaimBuster	7381	We're going to see unemployment going down, more jobs available, and the rate of inflation going down.	0
ClaimBuster	7382	In Iraq, we saw a threat, and we realized that after September the 11th, we must take threats seriously, before they fully materialize.	1
ClaimBuster	7383	I'm not questioning his patriotism.	0
ClaimBuster	7384	They're going backwards on the definition for wetlands.	0
ClaimBuster	7385	"Both said that this administration turned down the ""walk in the woods'' agreement first, and that would have been a perfect agreement from the standpoint of the United States in Europe and our security."	1
ClaimBuster	7386	My philosophy on taxes has been simple.	0
ClaimBuster	7387	This is one of the most important issues in this election.	0
ClaimBuster	7388	"And he called this woman ""Miss Piggy."""	1
ClaimBuster	7389	There was a chance to get this done.	0
ClaimBuster	7390	The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state.	0
ClaimBuster	7391	The Brady Bill has kept at least 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers from getting hand guns.	1
ClaimBuster	7392	If you graduated in the top quarter of your airlines, we gave you a John and Abigail Adams scholarship, four years tuition free in the college of your choice in Massachusetts, it's a public institution.	1
ClaimBuster	7393	And then a few days later, I was there greeting the caskets coming into Andrews Air Force Base and grieving with the families.	1
ClaimBuster	7394	We have not made the progress we need to make to put people back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	7395	Now, you point out, well, we're putting some back.	0
ClaimBuster	7396	It didn't hurt the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	7397	To extend it to all the world because the Communist aim is not to hold their own but to extend Communism.	0
ClaimBuster	7398	And at the beginning of the year I had about 2 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	7399	I have a better plan for homeland security.	0
ClaimBuster	7400	Let me first answer that question about the 1982 tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	7401	That's total over the last four years.	1
ClaimBuster	7402	But I can say this, uh - I'm doing the best I can to get away from that, and during the next ten days, the American people will not see the Carter campaign running uh - television advertisements and newspaper advertisements based on a personal attack on President Ford's character.	0
ClaimBuster	7403	In the interim, there has been the development on our part primarily, the cruise missiles; cruise missiles that could be launched from land-based mobile installations; cruise missiles that could be launched - launched from high-performance aircraft, like the B-52s or the B-1s, which I hope we proceed with; cruise missiles which could be launched from either surface or submarine uh - naval vessels.	1
ClaimBuster	7404	There's going to be a new Congress because the old one -- I don't want to get this man made at me -- but there was a post office scandal and a bank scandal.	1
ClaimBuster	7405	Let me comment on that.	0
ClaimBuster	7406	90% of our kids go to public schools.	1
ClaimBuster	7407	You have to put the money into it and the funding and the leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	7408	You know, we have five percent of the world's population in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	7409	Tipper and I have been married for 30 years.	1
ClaimBuster	7410	This president rushed to war, pushed our allies aside.	0
ClaimBuster	7411	You don't have to have the government mandate that for that to occur.	0
ClaimBuster	7412	I don't think anyone really believes that you're a person who's going to be pushing for oil and gas and coal.	0
ClaimBuster	7413	They're trying to defeat us.	0
ClaimBuster	7414	And if we didn't tell him that, why won't we even let the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee see the written instructions for Ambassador Glaspie?	0
ClaimBuster	7415	The most important thing is, I believe we've got the right ideas for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	7416	Some people have a mistaken view of it in America.	0
ClaimBuster	7417	We're going to bring back law and order.	0
ClaimBuster	7418	If you pay taxes, you ought to get tax relief.	0
ClaimBuster	7419	The president -- 95 percent of the containers that come into the ports, right here in Florida, are not inspected.	1
ClaimBuster	7420	Because look at the mess that we're in.	0
ClaimBuster	7421	Two days ago in the Oval Office, I met with the finance minister from Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	7422	Hillary Clinton -- and it's extremely complex -- Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people.	1
ClaimBuster	7423	What I want to do is to create an economy that is strong, and at the same time produce energy.	0
ClaimBuster	7424	We've gone from first to twelfth in the world in wages.	1
ClaimBuster	7425	"Now, understand what this means ""without preconditions."""	0
ClaimBuster	7426	I'd be delighted to, because you can't do it the old way.	0
ClaimBuster	7427	And so is Senator Kennedy a friend of yours.	1
ClaimBuster	7428	And the Illinois Medical Society, the organization of doctors in Illinois, voted against it.	1
ClaimBuster	7429	Senator McCain continues to repeat this.	1
ClaimBuster	7430	Well, I can't say that I have roundtabled that and sat down with the Chiefs of Staff, but I have said that it seems to me that this could be a logical step in what is my ultimate goal, my ultimate dream, and that is the elimination of nuclear weapons in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	7431	The number of uninsured has now gone up for the past seven years.	1
ClaimBuster	7432	Well, I come from the computer business, and everybody knows the women are more talented than the men.	1
ClaimBuster	7433	I understand how hard it is.	0
ClaimBuster	7434	This is the kind of leadership that we've had in this administration on the most deadly issue of our times.	0
ClaimBuster	7435	And I have been given great credit for what I did.	0
ClaimBuster	7436	He complains about secrecy and yet he is quoted as saying that in the attempt to find a solution in the Middle East that he would hold unpublicized meetings with the Soviet Union - I presume for the purpose of an - imposing a settlement on Israel and the Arab nations.	1
ClaimBuster	7437	Let's go to work and end this fiasco in Central America, a failed policy which has actually increased Cuban and Soviet influence.	0
ClaimBuster	7438	Under this administration we've had a continuation of the so-called balance of power politics, where everything is looked on as a struggle between us on the one side, the Soviet Union on the other.	0
ClaimBuster	7439	Let me tell you what I tried to do about it.	0
ClaimBuster	7440	I find that just astonishing.	0
ClaimBuster	7441	I said I would cut taxes for small businesses, who are the drivers and engines of growth.	1
ClaimBuster	7442	He said he just discovered that most Soviet missiles are on land, and that's why his proposal didn't work.	1
ClaimBuster	7443	I would not meet Mr. Khrushchev unless there were some agreements at the secondary level - foreign ministers or ambassadors - which would indicate that the meeting would have some hope of success, or a useful exchange of ideas.	0
ClaimBuster	7444	I do believe Saddam Hussein was a threat.	0
ClaimBuster	7445	That's what's been squeezing middle class families.	1
ClaimBuster	7446	And it's a plan that lowers cost for everybody, covers all children.	1
ClaimBuster	7447	That's the reason I decided to run for president, and I'm hopeful that all of you are prepared to continue this extraordinary journey that we call America.	0
ClaimBuster	7448	I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year -- and that's the vast majority of Americans as you know -- will have their taxes raised, because I think we've got to go where the money is.	1
ClaimBuster	7449	We will maintain our position of neutrality in the Iran and Iraq war.	0
ClaimBuster	7450	I will do everything I can, if I get up there, to make dirty tricks a thing of the past.	0
ClaimBuster	7451	Osama bin Laden and General Petraeus have one thing in common that I know of, they both said that Iraq is the central battleground.	1
ClaimBuster	7452	I could have rationalized it.	0
ClaimBuster	7453	That's explicitly prohibited in the law.	1
ClaimBuster	7454	Well, I -- I do think...	0
ClaimBuster	7455	So I think we can all share, with respect, in the fact that maybe the message is not getting out.	0
ClaimBuster	7456	I believe all of those should be gone over in detail to make sure that no one is getting a tax break; to make sure that no one is getting away from paying the taxes he ought to pay.	0
ClaimBuster	7457	Well, the record in Arkansas.	0
ClaimBuster	7458	And he wanted to buy the business but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	7459	Now, if we get our tax policies right so that they're good for the middle class, if we reverse the policies of the last eight years that got us into this fix in the first place and that Senator McCain supported, then we are going to be in a position to deal with Social Security and deal with Medicare, because we will have a health care plan that actually works for you, reduces spending and costs over the long term, and Social Security that is stable and solvent for all Americans and not just some.	0
ClaimBuster	7460	And of course, I've been talking about the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	7461	And it would not cover several million people who are not covered by Social Security at all.	1
ClaimBuster	7462	So, look, nobody likes taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	7463	It's very important to me.	0
ClaimBuster	7464	With Mali now having North Mali taken over by Al Qaida; with Syria having Assad continuing to -- to kill, to murder his own people, this is a region in tumult.	1
ClaimBuster	7465	And yet he condemns the vetoes that I have made that has - that have saved the taxpayer $9 billion and could have saved an additional $13 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	7466	Once and for all, I want to do something about Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	7467	Understand themselves as Americans in every way except having papers.	0
ClaimBuster	7468	But Syria is no longer Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	7469	I have a different experience.	0
ClaimBuster	7470	They know the Democratic party won't do it.	0
ClaimBuster	7471	First, we've got to improve our education system and we've made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools.	1
ClaimBuster	7472	We're protecting people, they have to pay up.	0
ClaimBuster	7473	Nuclear power is not only important as far as eliminating our dependence on foreign oil but it's also responsibility as far as climate change is concerned.	0
ClaimBuster	7474	And, in fact, afterwards, Congressman Lewis put out a similar statement, saying that he had probably gone over the line.	1
ClaimBuster	7475	And we should be able to do that for our country.	0
ClaimBuster	7476	We may be able to get satisfactory assurances.	0
ClaimBuster	7477	And here he says he's going to be a fiscal conservative, all of a sudden.	1
ClaimBuster	7478	Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems.	0
ClaimBuster	7479	And I think this will work.	0
ClaimBuster	7480	And they were graphically demonstrated again today.	0
ClaimBuster	7481	And in the first few years they either learn how to learn or don't learn how to learn.	0
ClaimBuster	7482	It's not going to be quick.	0
ClaimBuster	7483	First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which...	1
ClaimBuster	7484	And I think that in that case uh - some of the more liberal uh - members of the uh - so-called Warren Court agreed with those decisions.	1
ClaimBuster	7485	We still have no comprehensive energy policy in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	7486	They're setting new records this year.	0
ClaimBuster	7487	Now, that also means that you've got more customers.	0
ClaimBuster	7488	There are some limited places where that was appropriate.	0
ClaimBuster	7489	Mr. Morgan, I suggested that if the United States felt that it could save the summit conference that it would have been proper for us to have expressed regrets.	1
ClaimBuster	7490	So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication.	0
ClaimBuster	7491	You yourself said, Mr. Vice President, a month ago, that if we had provided the kind of economic aid five years ago that we are now providing we might never have had Castro.	1
ClaimBuster	7492	We estimate that those programs would add a hundred billion dollars minimum and probably two hundred billion dollars - uhh maximum each year to the federal budget.	1
ClaimBuster	7493	And we'll continue to promote freedom around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	7494	Barbara, reluctant as I am to say anything critical about Governor Reagan, I will try to answer your question.	0
ClaimBuster	7495	May I ask for an exception because I think we owe Carole Simpson -- anybody who can stand in between these three characters here and get the job done -- we owe her a round of applause.	0
ClaimBuster	7496	The Soviet Union, for instance, put pressure on Mr. Ford and he refused to see a symbol of human freedom recognized around the world, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.	1
ClaimBuster	7497	We've got some agreement on the nuclear, but we don't have those things put away yet.	0
ClaimBuster	7498	And, among other things, I would say, okay, over here in this Senate committee to the chairman who is anxious to get this bill passed, the president who is anxious, I'd say rather than just yelling at one another, why don't we find out where we're apart, try to get together, get the bill passed and give the people the benefits and not play party politics right now.	0
ClaimBuster	7499	And in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world.	1
ClaimBuster	7500	Well over a million and a quarter Americans are HIV-positive.	1
ClaimBuster	7501	You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job.	0
ClaimBuster	7502	"I mean, look, if we want to talk about Congressman Lewis, who is an American hero, he, unprompted by my campaign, without my campaign's awareness, made a statement that he was troubled with what he was hearing at some of the rallies that your running mate was holding, in which all the Republican reports indicated were shouting, when my name came up, things like ""terrorist"" and ""kill him,"" and that you're running mate didn't mention, didn't stop, didn't say ""Hold on a second, that's kind of out of line."""	1
ClaimBuster	7503	"He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn't be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, ""Mexican."""	1
ClaimBuster	7504	The international community, the international world said this is the right thing to do, but when it came time to authorize the use of force on the Senate floor, my opponent voted against the use of force.	1
ClaimBuster	7505	I have increased, as president, by over 60 percent the funding for water treatment plants in the United States, the federal contribution.	1
ClaimBuster	7506	I think that holding onto the old ways and the old argument that the environment and the economy are in conflict is really outdated.	0
ClaimBuster	7507	It would be the largest increase in government health care ever.	0
ClaimBuster	7508	Look, we've sailed Navy ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them.	1
ClaimBuster	7509	The vice president has a long resume.	1
ClaimBuster	7510	Senator Dole remembers well that we actually offered not to even put in a healthcare bill in 1994, uh '93, but instead to work with the Senate Republicans and write a joint bill.	1
ClaimBuster	7511	In my program for energy independence we have increased, for example, solar energy research from about $84 million a year to about a hundred and twenty million dollars a year.	1
ClaimBuster	7512	So I don't want the implication to be that somehow everything we say is just cooked up and put in our head by somebody else.	0
ClaimBuster	7513	It's not that Dodd-Frank always was wrong with too much regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	7514	And this is why a tax reform is so important.	0
ClaimBuster	7515	Another thing is a system called DISC which was originally designed, proposed by Mr. Nixon, to encourage exports.	1
ClaimBuster	7516	I said I looked into his eyes and saw three letters, a K, a G and a B.	0
ClaimBuster	7517	General Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, told him he was going to need several hundred thousand.	1
ClaimBuster	7518	It's their ingenuity, I agree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	7519	If we catch somebody illegally selling a gun, there needs to be a consequence.	0
ClaimBuster	7520	It's completely out of control.	0
ClaimBuster	7521	It wasn't a government takeover of health care.	1
ClaimBuster	7522	Well, I want to make sure we're not handing the health care system over to the federal government which is basically what would ultimately happen with Senator Obama's health care plan.	0
ClaimBuster	7523	And it's free trade, fair trade that needs to be our hallmark, and we need more free trade agreements, not fewer.	0
ClaimBuster	7524	And yet that very committee of which I am chairman has been handicapped by the fact that we have not had adequate funds; we have not had adequate powers; we haven't had an adequate staff.	0
ClaimBuster	7525	I'm proud of the fact that America is stronger and more prosperous and more secure than we were four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	7526	I want the government to pinch pennies for a change instead of the American families.	0
ClaimBuster	7527	Think about that father down there in Houston who has to tell his youngster that he can't play little league ball that he can't go out on the ball field because he's afraid he's going to get hurt.	0
ClaimBuster	7528	I've spent my whole adult life very close to the military.	1
ClaimBuster	7529	Where a child can walk in and have their heart turned dark as a result of being on the Internet and walk in and decide to take somebody else's life?	0
ClaimBuster	7530	But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.	1
ClaimBuster	7531	I want to make small businesses grow and thrive.	0
ClaimBuster	7532	But I think marriage is a sacred institution.	0
ClaimBuster	7533	They want to look good.	0
ClaimBuster	7534	Well, I've been kind of a hard-liner on this issue for more than eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	7535	I'm not proud of any record.	0
ClaimBuster	7536	There are American jobs that are being lost.	0
ClaimBuster	7537	Plus the fact, that the special prosecutor, on his own initiation, and the attorney general on his initiation, the highest law enforcement official in this country, all of them have given me a clean bill of health.	1
ClaimBuster	7538	I'd just note that I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not.	0
ClaimBuster	7539	As I've studied the record between myself and Governor Reagan, I've been impressed with the stark differences that exist between us.	0
ClaimBuster	7540	But it seems to me the record is clear.	0
ClaimBuster	7541	So military security and economic security go hand in hand.	0
ClaimBuster	7542	We, I think, are the only developed nation in the world that has no comprehensive energy policy, to permit us to plan in an orderly way how to shift from increasing the scarce uh - energy uh - forms: oil, and have research and development concentrated on the increased use of coal, which I strongly favor.	0
ClaimBuster	7543	I owe the special interests nothing.	0
ClaimBuster	7544	It's more difficult to defend this nation.	0
ClaimBuster	7545	Let -- let me just finish their point, because you're looking for contrast.	0
ClaimBuster	7546	This has been an extraordinary 18 months for Kitty and me and for our family.	0
ClaimBuster	7547	We're going to have to try to provide closer ties, to associate ourselves with the great desire of these people for a better life if we're going to prevent Castro's influence from spreading throughout all of Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	7548	It's based on the plan of Governor Jim Hunt in North Carolina, and it works great.	1
ClaimBuster	7549	I want to give seniors who are, well, the near elderly, I don't like that term because I am just about in that category, but those 55 to 65 ought to be able to buy into Medicare for premiums that are reasonable and fair and significantly below what they have to get now.	0
ClaimBuster	7550	I'll see you tomorrow night -- (Laughter) on NBC -- 10:30 to 11:00 Eastern Time.	1
ClaimBuster	7551	And you can't just go up and say I'm going to fix it.	0
ClaimBuster	7552	That's something I know how to do.	0
ClaimBuster	7553	Now, you're -- and the way it would happen is that under his plan, if a school was designated as failing, the kids would be trapped there for another three years and then some of them would get federal vouchers and the state would be forced to match those, that money.	1
ClaimBuster	7554	I think you have heavy obligations which affect our security, which we're going to have to meet.	0
ClaimBuster	7555	That's the kind of leadership we've shown.	0
ClaimBuster	7556	But I think math, common sense, and our history shows us that's not a recipe for job growth.	0
ClaimBuster	7557	There was a big story I think in U.S.A. Today of the millions of people who have now registered because of it.	1
ClaimBuster	7558	Well, let -- let me say, Bob, thank you.	0
ClaimBuster	7559	The difficulty now is the president's course is quite limited.	0
ClaimBuster	7560	And the -- the central question at this point is going to be: Who is going to be credible to all parties involved?	0
ClaimBuster	7561	Now, I must say what Mr. Nixon wants to do is commit us - as I understand him, so that we can be clear if there's a disagreement - he wants us to be committed to the defense of these islands merely as the defense of these islands as free territory, not as part of the defense of Formosa.	0
ClaimBuster	7562	Five million jobs doesn't even keep up with our population growth.	1
ClaimBuster	7563	I guarantee you, as president of the United States, I know how to heal the wounds of war, I know how to deal with our adversaries, and I know how to deal with our friends.	0
ClaimBuster	7564	We relied in the Middle East on the Baghdad Pact, and yet when the Iraqi Government was changed, the Baghdad Pact broke down.	1
ClaimBuster	7565	And I would love to see the next three weeks devoted to talking about the economy, devoted to talking about health care, devoted to talking about energy, and figuring out how the American people can send their kids to college.	0
ClaimBuster	7566	So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing.	0
ClaimBuster	7567	We're going to have to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	7568	I think once a decision has been made, it's been made unless it's proven to be unsafe to women.	0
ClaimBuster	7569	It was taken away from her.	1
ClaimBuster	7570	He -- he doesn't answer that question.	1
ClaimBuster	7571	No nation will ever have a veto over us.	0
ClaimBuster	7572	They're going to see their own doctor when Bob Dole is president.	0
ClaimBuster	7573	The connection that's been made again between the deficit and the interest rates -- there is no connection between them.	1
ClaimBuster	7574	The American people see this debt, and they know it's got to come down.	0
ClaimBuster	7575	Well, I think it should be a right for every American.	0
ClaimBuster	7576	I favor the present depletion allowance.	0
ClaimBuster	7577	And if we want to talk about oil company profits, under your tax plan, John -- this is undeniable -- oil companies would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks.	1
ClaimBuster	7578	But look, Jim, the world is changing so rapidly.	0
ClaimBuster	7579	But just a few years ago you said that's something you'd never do.	1
ClaimBuster	7580	Soldiers know over there that this isn't being done right yet.	0
ClaimBuster	7581	As a matter of fact, I wouldn't support it if I thought that.	0
ClaimBuster	7582	This is an administration that gave you the big tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	7583	Now, this economic package, Tim, I'm glad you asked, because you look like the type that might be able to benefit from a 15 percent across- the-board tax cut and $500-per-child tax credit, or -- you know, estate tax relief which you're not interested in right now, but capital gains rate reduction.	0
ClaimBuster	7584	Your husband disagrees with you.	1
ClaimBuster	7585	But our training programs right now, we've got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies.	1
ClaimBuster	7586	We don't have to settle for what we're going through.	0
ClaimBuster	7587	So I think, yes, we will have to change in a very appreciable way, some of the lifestyles that we now enjoy.	0
ClaimBuster	7588	But there were some problems, some unintended consequences.	0
ClaimBuster	7589	And institutions are beginning to function.	1
ClaimBuster	7590	I do want to make sure that -- I do want to make sure that we just understand something.	0
ClaimBuster	7591	I got a- a complete report back from those countries from these two distinguished - uh - gentlemen.	1
ClaimBuster	7592	And four years ago they campaigned on getting prescription drugs for seniors.	1
ClaimBuster	7593	And not one thing did I see, with respect, on your network about my views on agriculture, and not one did I read in any newspaper.	0
ClaimBuster	7594	I want to focus on results.	0
ClaimBuster	7595	I don't know what time it is, but it's probably getting late.	0
ClaimBuster	7596	We are today subsidizing housing for more than 10 million people, and we're going to continue along that line.	1
ClaimBuster	7597	I am going to make a major speech on this whole subject next week before the next debate, and I will have an opportunity then to answer any other questions that may arise with regard to my position on it.	0
ClaimBuster	7598	Well, we still are the envy of the world in terms of our military.	0
ClaimBuster	7599	We need campaign finance reform and we need to shoot straight with young and old alike and tell them what the real choices are.	0
ClaimBuster	7600	I get audited almost every year.	1
ClaimBuster	7601	How are we going to do it?	0
ClaimBuster	7602	You heard what I was for, and that's what I support.	1
ClaimBuster	7603	But in my view, the president should have grabbed it.	0
ClaimBuster	7604	Well, my last word is again to say this: We were talking about this very simple amendment and women's rights.	0
ClaimBuster	7605	Well, I don't have time in 30 seconds, or whatever -- a minute -- to talk about our health care reform plan.	0
ClaimBuster	7606	States like Arizona, Rhode Island have taken these -- these Medicaid dollars; have shown they can run these programs more cost-effectively.	1
ClaimBuster	7607	I think the presidency of the United States is a very serious office, and I think we have to address these issues in a very serious way.	0
ClaimBuster	7608	Saddam is probably about as strong as he ever was.	0
ClaimBuster	7609	Saddam Hussein is probably better off than he was four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	7610	You know, we looked at the same intelligence and came to the same conclusion: that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat.	1
ClaimBuster	7611	I don't think that's extreme at all; and yet nearly two-thirds to three-fourths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against that proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	7612	Well, let me say that I think that we might ought to review the terms, the way it works.	0
ClaimBuster	7613	When it comes to making college affordable, whether it's two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed.	1
ClaimBuster	7614	But it certainly ought to be the long-term goal of all Americans and I think it is.	0
ClaimBuster	7615	So for instance, I would not give driver's licenses to those that have come here illegally as the president would.	1
ClaimBuster	7616	I think America's best days are still ahead, but we've got to build the right bridge.	0
ClaimBuster	7617	And once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies.	0
ClaimBuster	7618	The same is true for Michelle and I'm sure the same is true for a lot of you.	0
ClaimBuster	7619	But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they've gone wild with their nuclear program.	0
ClaimBuster	7620	And what I have said, because the free trade -- the trade agreement itself does have labor and environmental protections, but we have to stand for human rights and we have to make sure that violence isn't being perpetrated against workers who are just trying to organize for their rights, which is why, for example, I supported the Peruvian Free Trade Agreement which was a well-structured agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	7621	I talk to the Republican leaders and they want it.	1
ClaimBuster	7622	Look, the right course for America's government, we were talking about the role of government, is not to become the economic player, picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	7623	And he put a trial lawyer on the ticket.	1
ClaimBuster	7624	Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country?	0
ClaimBuster	7625	They want to judge it on the record itself.	0
ClaimBuster	7626	I think everyone's paying too much, but I think this idea that you can go out and -- then he hits me for vetoing a tax bill.	0
ClaimBuster	7627	I believe the role of government is to stand side by side with our citizens to help them realize their dreams, not tell citizens how to live their lives.	0
ClaimBuster	7628	Because they wanted to have the same choice that you and I and Cindy and your wife have had.	0
ClaimBuster	7629	And that's the kind of presidency I want to lead.	0
ClaimBuster	7630	I want to see us finalize that START agreement and I want it to be the one to finally lead the world to banishing chemical and biological weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	7631	That's what the election was about.	0
ClaimBuster	7632	But it seemed to me there's got to be some end to the frivolous lawsuits and there's got to be some cap on punitive damage.	0
ClaimBuster	7633	And production on gas --	0
ClaimBuster	7634	I have maintained from the very beginning of my campaign, and this was a standard answer that I made in response to the Yugoslavian question, that I would never uh - go to war or become militarily involved, in the internal affairs of another country unless our own security was direc- rectly threatened.	0
ClaimBuster	7635	Now, I could get rid of it in 4 years in theory on the books now, but to do it you'd have to raise taxes too much and cut benefits too much to people who need them and it would even make the economy worse.	0
ClaimBuster	7636	I'm not as confident as he is that we will be the strongest military power by 1963.	0
ClaimBuster	7637	And right now, as you know, the US took the lead in a no-fly operation up there in-- no- fly order up in the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	7638	Well, I would say that one meeting that made a profound impression on me was when the mayors of the big cities, including the mayor of Los Angeles, a Democrat, came to see me, and they unanimously said the decline in urban America stems from the decline in the American family.	1
ClaimBuster	7639	Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	7640	You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials.	1
ClaimBuster	7641	I've stood up to Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	7642	But we're investing a much smaller percentage of our income in the things you just asked about than all of our major competitors, and our wealth growth is going down as a result of it.	1
ClaimBuster	7643	They were choking on the sanctions.	0
ClaimBuster	7644	The bottom line is this: I think the American people, thought he'd recite all these bills and all these things, they want to know what's going to happen to them.	0
ClaimBuster	7645	I've acknowledged that in union halls across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	7646	And perhaps the biggest is world peace.	0
ClaimBuster	7647	No, but I'm glad you asked that question, because I know it's on many peoples' minds.	0
ClaimBuster	7648	We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets.	1
ClaimBuster	7649	So I've thought long and hard about the honor of being the President of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	7650	The point was made by Mr. Nixon that the Soviet production is only forty-four percent of ours.	1
ClaimBuster	7651	We balanced the budget in the '90s.	1
ClaimBuster	7652	The facts are though -- the facts are -- the American people are hurting.	0
ClaimBuster	7653	Bob, let me -- let me respond.	0
ClaimBuster	7654	If you don't mind, I'd like to use the balance of the time to respond to one of the comments that Senator Kennedy made on the previous question.	0
ClaimBuster	7655	It gets larger even with growth.	0
ClaimBuster	7656	For instance, we now have uh - in the health area three hundred and two different programs administered by eleven major departments and agencies, sixty other advisory commissions responsible for this.	1
ClaimBuster	7657	Recognize that we have a voluntary military.	0
ClaimBuster	7658	But don't just sit here slow dancing for 4 years doing nothing.	0
ClaimBuster	7659	We wanted to have majority rule with the full protection of the rights of the minority.	0
ClaimBuster	7660	We've opened up public lands.	1
ClaimBuster	7661	He forgot to tell you he voted to tax Social Security benefits more than one time.	1
ClaimBuster	7662	I'm not gonna raise taxes on middle class Americans to pay for the programs I've recommended.	0
ClaimBuster	7663	They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life.	0
ClaimBuster	7664	I see the Middle East with a rising tide of violence, chaos, tumult.	0
ClaimBuster	7665	You're running ads that misportray completely my position on immigration.	0
ClaimBuster	7666	He fails to point out that uh - in the 1950s we were engaged in the war in Vietnam.	1
ClaimBuster	7667	And you voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	7668	You're going to see health premiums go up by some $2,500 per family.	0
ClaimBuster	7669	China has been a currency manipulator for years and years and years.	1
ClaimBuster	7670	Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money.	0
ClaimBuster	7671	Middle-class people, defined as people with incomes of $52,000 and down, had their incomes go down while their taxes went up in the Reagan-Bush years because of 6 increases in the payroll taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	7672	When I was a young man, when I got out of the Navy I had multiple job offers.	1
ClaimBuster	7673	Along with what he also wants to do in terms of eliminating the estate tax, along what he wants to do in terms of corporates, changes in the tax code, it costs about $5 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	7674	You know, we went on the Libyan raid -- do you remember that one?	1
ClaimBuster	7675	And she's been talking about the inner cities for 25 years.	1
ClaimBuster	7676	And what did you do right after the election?	0
ClaimBuster	7677	If you want somebody who is willing to fight for you, I am asking for your support and your vote and, yes, your confidence and your willingness to believe that we can do the right thing in America, and be the better for it.	0
ClaimBuster	7678	We returned $5.7 billion in tax rebates, credits and cuts to our people.	1
ClaimBuster	7679	Number two is to cut spending.	0
ClaimBuster	7680	And as a matter of fact, when the president ran for office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2,500 a family.	1
ClaimBuster	7681	22 million new jobs, very low unemployment nationally.	1
ClaimBuster	7682	The federal government can get local and -- and state schools to do a better job.	0
ClaimBuster	7683	I think the principal that separates me is that 5 and a half million people came together on their own and put me on the ballot.	1
ClaimBuster	7684	You don't take America to war unless have the plan to win the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	7685	We've got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America.	0
ClaimBuster	7686	We have a very divided nation.	1
ClaimBuster	7687	I said well, this is simple.	1
ClaimBuster	7688	If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed.	1
ClaimBuster	7689	So why pass a law that won't fix it?	0
ClaimBuster	7690	No insult ever cleaned up a toxic waste dump or helped an elderly person.	1
ClaimBuster	7691	Of course, we have to do some things tactically, some of which Senator Obama is correct on.	0
ClaimBuster	7692	It is the kind of change that can open up a whole new world of opportunities to America as we enter the last decade of this century and move towards the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	7693	All that his advisers do is to give counsel when he asks for it.	0
ClaimBuster	7694	I'm not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	7695	We need to have more community health centers.	0
ClaimBuster	7696	Pay $1 an hour for your labor, have no health care -- that's the most expensive single element in making the car.	1
ClaimBuster	7697	I cannot let this go by, the old-style Washington politics, of we're going to scare you in the voting booth.	0
ClaimBuster	7698	That is a very important objective -- to make certain that we continue to look forward to progress toward greater independence by these nations and work with each of them separately.	0
ClaimBuster	7699	And I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn't have a place in Donald Trump's America.	1
ClaimBuster	7700	I think we need to put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox.	0
ClaimBuster	7701	And if you make a mistake, say you made a mistake and go on about your business, trying to serve the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	7702	"He went so far as to call it ""brutal economics."""	1
ClaimBuster	7703	The Office of Minority Business in the Department of Commerce has made available more money in trying to help uh - black businessmen or other minority businessmen than any other administration since the office was established.	1
ClaimBuster	7704	There are some other things that have been said here -- back, and you said that I might be able to dredge them up.	0
ClaimBuster	7705	And we know that, if we drill off-shore and exploit a lot of these reserves, it will help, at temporarily, relieve our energy requirements.	0
ClaimBuster	7706	I would not let the Soviet Union get their hands on it at all.	0
ClaimBuster	7707	We can debate methods, we can debate one decision or another, but there are two uh things which cannot be debated - experience and results.	0
ClaimBuster	7708	It was a trial lawyer's dream.	0
ClaimBuster	7709	I don't appoint people I think are liberal or people who think - who I think are conservative.	0
ClaimBuster	7710	And in my view, the Constitution ought to be interpreted as a document that grows with our country and our history.	0
ClaimBuster	7711	I think the reason that we're not saying send American troops in at this point is severalfold.	0
ClaimBuster	7712	Governor Carter in his acceptance speech called for more and more programs, which means more and more government.	0
ClaimBuster	7713	What I've said is we're going to encourage democracy in Pakistan, expand our nonmilitary aid to Pakistan so that they have more of a stake in working with us, but insisting that they go after these militants.	1
ClaimBuster	7714	And you know what you'll find?	0
ClaimBuster	7715	And now with the financial crisis, car dealerships are closing and people can't get car loans.	1
ClaimBuster	7716	The trillion dollars comes out of the surplus so that you can invest some of your own money.	1
ClaimBuster	7717	Now this just wasn't true.	1
ClaimBuster	7718	And I'll tell you this, I will fight for a clean environment in ways that strengthen our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	7719	And the promise of the revolution was democracy, human rights, free labor unions, free press.	1
ClaimBuster	7720	We have a program for a gradual reduction of Government spending based on these theories, and I have a task force now that has been working on where those cuts could be made.	0
ClaimBuster	7721	I said she doesn't have the stamina.	1
ClaimBuster	7722	And when Senator McCain says that he wants to provide children health care, what he doesn't mention is he voted against the expansion of the Children's Health Insurance Program that is responsible for making sure that so many children who didn't have previously health insurance have it now.	1
ClaimBuster	7723	We in effect tried to make Israel the scapegoat for the problems in the Middle East.	1
ClaimBuster	7724	That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business.	0
ClaimBuster	7725	His plan is three times larger than President Clinton's proposed plan eight years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	7726	And we worked together with Democrats to relieve the tax burden on the middle class and all who pay taxes in order to make sure this economy continues to grow.	1
ClaimBuster	7727	I say the one thing you have over me is experience, but it's bad experience, because what you've done has turned out badly.	0
ClaimBuster	7728	So I think the American people, including the Perot supporters, know that I have had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform, and I will continue to have.	1
ClaimBuster	7729	Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad.	0
ClaimBuster	7730	I'd like to respond to that.	0
ClaimBuster	7731	Now, the reason I think that it's important to just get these facts out is because the allegation that Senator McCain has continually made is that somehow my associations are troubling.	0
ClaimBuster	7732	You can't get there from here and the fact is that we can create 700,000 jobs by building constructing 45 new nuclear power plants by the year 2030.	0
ClaimBuster	7733	Well, let me -- let me start by saying, words matter.	0
ClaimBuster	7734	I disagree with the proposal that maybe only when oil supplies are at stake that our national security is at risk.	0
ClaimBuster	7735	And, so, I'm encouraged with what I see when I talk to Mr. -- what I hear when I talk to Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadze, but can they pull it off.	0
ClaimBuster	7736	And everybody's getting a fair shot.	0
ClaimBuster	7737	In other words, there is a growing public confidence in the strength of this economy.	1
ClaimBuster	7738	I thought it was a good program.	0
ClaimBuster	7739	Candy, I don't have a policy of stopping wind jobs in Iowa and that -- they're not phantom jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	7740	Osama bin Laden isn't going to determine how we defend ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	7741	Because they understand that our military is overextended under the president.	0
ClaimBuster	7742	That's where growth will come from.	0
ClaimBuster	7743	The governor said that he doesn't think this problem is necessarily caused by people.	1
ClaimBuster	7744	I support clean coal technology.	0
ClaimBuster	7745	And we have stood on the side of democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	7746	We're living in an interconnected world.	1
ClaimBuster	7747	And I ask you to embark on that journey with me.	0
ClaimBuster	7748	That's why I fight against poverty.	0
ClaimBuster	7749	We can be once again.	0
ClaimBuster	7750	I think that in the aftermath of the Cold War, it's time for us to do something very similar, to step up to the plate, to provide the leadership on the environment, leadership to make sure the world economy keeps moving in the right direction.	0
ClaimBuster	7751	Because she has been a disaster as a senator.	0
ClaimBuster	7752	We were succeeding, and that was why the terrorist acts began.	0
ClaimBuster	7753	I want to take one-half of the surplus and dedicate it to Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	7754	I think if the president is responsible, if he consults with those involved, if he makes it clear that the Supreme Court decision is going to be carried out in a way that the Supreme Court planned - with deliberate speed - then in my judgment, providing he's behind action, I believe we can make uh - progress.	0
ClaimBuster	7755	And they know who appropriates the money.	0
ClaimBuster	7756	But I would like to use my remaining time on this exchange, Jim, to respond to an exchange that took place just a moment ago.	0
ClaimBuster	7757	Cutting taxes on the wealthy, we've tried that.	1
ClaimBuster	7758	Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine.	1
ClaimBuster	7759	We were celebrating our Bicentennial; and I find that uh - there is a - a movement as I travel around the country of greater interest in this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	7760	And that's why it's essential that we have strong alliances, and we do.	0
ClaimBuster	7761	I've got an agenda that I want to get done for the country.	0
ClaimBuster	7762	I believe the ideal world is one in which every child is protected in law and welcomed to life.	0
ClaimBuster	7763	Hillary Clinton has been after this for years.	1
ClaimBuster	7764	It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one Republican to join, at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House - not one Republican - and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it.	1
ClaimBuster	7765	It had bipartisan support; it should have had bipartisan support.	1
ClaimBuster	7766	We've got them all out there.	1
ClaimBuster	7767	And I've said this to President Karzai.	1
ClaimBuster	7768	... but those other charges, as she knows, are false.	1
ClaimBuster	7769	Well, my first job as commander in chief, Bob, is to keep the American people safe.	0
ClaimBuster	7770	I am optimistic and I believe we can keep this longest expansion going.	0
ClaimBuster	7771	And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad.	0
ClaimBuster	7772	If we're $4 trillion down, we should have everything perfect, but we don't.	1
ClaimBuster	7773	They see scandals almost on a daily basis.	0
ClaimBuster	7774	"I don't know how you vote ""present"" on some of that."	0
ClaimBuster	7775	Of course, he voted for the resolution - it was virtually unanimous.	1
ClaimBuster	7776	Actually, you'd have to have some amendments to the Constitution because of the way the Constitution reads.	0
ClaimBuster	7777	Take, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	7778	Well, some of those facts and figures just don't stand up.	0
ClaimBuster	7779	Yes, I think we should look at the punitive and we should have some limitations.	0
ClaimBuster	7780	One thing I think Americans should be proud of, when Tunisians began to protest, this nation -- me, my administration -- stood with them earlier than just about any country.	1
ClaimBuster	7781	I'm optimistic about the future.	0
ClaimBuster	7782	And education is my number one priority, because I think that it's the most important big major change that we can bring in our country.	0
ClaimBuster	7783	He doesn't take that position that I've seen so far in Laos.	0
ClaimBuster	7784	Now, I think we should be reluctant to get involved in someplace in a foreign country.	0
ClaimBuster	7785	You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change.	0
ClaimBuster	7786	Then the multilateral force withdrew for only one reason: We withdrew because we were no longer able to carry out the mission for which we had been sent in.	1
ClaimBuster	7787	We were the first ones to put sanctions on.	1
ClaimBuster	7788	I think Mr. Benson's program has failed.	0
ClaimBuster	7789	You know, give you a little tax cut, give you a couple of years, then make the tax increases go on forever.	0
ClaimBuster	7790	The CBO says we'll have a trillion-dollar deficit each of the next four years.	1
ClaimBuster	7791	I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited.	1
ClaimBuster	7792	I might say this in closing, and that is that as far as foreign policy goes, Mr. Kissinger has been the president of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	7793	No, Morton, I don't agree to all of those things.	0
ClaimBuster	7794	Gas is a clean fuel that we can burn to -- we need to make sure that if we decontrol our plants that there's mandatory -- that the plants must conform to clean air standards, the grandfathered plants, that's what we did in Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	7795	Well, the President can define himself in any way he wants, but I think we have to look at the record.	0
ClaimBuster	7796	Governor Bush is for vouchers, and in his plan he proposes to drain more money, more taxpayer money out of the public schools for private school vouchers than all of the money that he proposes in his entire budget for public schools themselves.	1
ClaimBuster	7797	And also domestic exploration yes, but not in the environmental treasures of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	7798	I've tried to find the common ground, because that's what makes us strong as Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	7799	No litmus test except for how they interpret the Constitution.	0
ClaimBuster	7800	And if you enter bilateral talks, they'll be happy to walk away from the table.	0
ClaimBuster	7801	There's no easy way to do this when you're dealing with an economy that's traditionally been more closed than one that's traditionally been more open.	0
ClaimBuster	7802	Mr. Bush's Bureau of Labor Statistics says that Arkansas ranks first in the country in the growth of new jobs this year, first.	1
ClaimBuster	7803	And the final judgment about the future of the nation - war, peace, involvement, reticence, thoughtfulness, care, consideration, concern - has to be made by the man in the Oval Office.	0
ClaimBuster	7804	And if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney's proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere.	0
ClaimBuster	7805	My economic plan, my trade position, Bosnia, Haiti, taking on the NRA for the first time, taking on the tobacco companies for the first time.	1
ClaimBuster	7806	We deliberately took figures that we, ourselves, believed were too conservative.	0
ClaimBuster	7807	And we made good progress early on.	0
ClaimBuster	7808	As a matter of fact - now- I don't advocate amnesty; I advocate pardon.	0
ClaimBuster	7809	I mention the last debate --	1
ClaimBuster	7810	That's one of the big disagreements that we have with the President -- that they have not pursued the diplomatic opportunities either within El Salvador or as between the countries and have lost time during which we might have been able to achieve a peace	1
ClaimBuster	7811	We may have different approaches.	0
ClaimBuster	7812	And, America, this is one of those issues that separates the president and myself.	0
ClaimBuster	7813	I signed the partial-birth -- the ban on partial-birth abortion.	1
ClaimBuster	7814	And we're bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero.	1
ClaimBuster	7815	We keep the good faith and credit of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	7816	And he went on to cite three issues that their platforms totally ignore: atomic warfare, Presidential Directive 59 notwithstanding.	1
ClaimBuster	7817	We are in a very difficult time.	0
ClaimBuster	7818	As long as there is a Democratic President in the White House, we will have a strong and viable Social Security System, free of the threat of bankruptcy.	0
ClaimBuster	7819	That, however, is raising taxes for those who pay Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	7820	It's going to be one of the themes you hear tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	7821	We've got to begin to get back to the business of building and rehabilitating housing for families of low and moderate income in this country; housing for young families that they can look forward some day to buy.	0
ClaimBuster	7822	"In answer to your question about Iraq and sending people into Iraq, he just said, ""The enemy attacked us."""	1
ClaimBuster	7823	He voted to increase taxes 98 times.	1
ClaimBuster	7824	Maybe that's part of the answer.	0
ClaimBuster	7825	You're not going to be targeted in or targeted out.	0
ClaimBuster	7826	I certainly agree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	7827	I served at the UN.	1
ClaimBuster	7828	I would just point out, on the point Mr. Perot made, I agree that we need to cut spending in Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	7829	And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid -- the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that's going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	7830	Now Governor Romney had a very different response.	1
ClaimBuster	7831	And other Americans have been singled out because of their race or ethnicity.	1
ClaimBuster	7832	This was just a few weeks ago that you indicated that we should still have troops in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	7833	It means also helping local school districts that sometimes find the parents of school age children outvoted on bond issues, to give them some help with interest-free bonding authority so that we can build new schools and modernize the classrooms.	0
ClaimBuster	7834	"You said it when President Carter said that you were going to cut Medicare, and you said, ""Oh, no, there you go again, Mr."	1
ClaimBuster	7835	I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really...	0
ClaimBuster	7836	One of the reasons I was successful as the governor of Texas is because I didn't try to be all things to all people.	0
ClaimBuster	7837	Now, I could probably give you some other examples of decisions over the last 24 years.	0
ClaimBuster	7838	In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt said in his inaugural that this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny.	1
ClaimBuster	7839	And I've been out here for 13 months meeting in meetings just like this ever since October, with people like you all over America, people that have lost their jobs, lost their livelihood, lost their health insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	7840	Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy.	1
ClaimBuster	7841	Everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief.	0
ClaimBuster	7842	I would challenge Mr. Gorbachev to join with us in limiting in eliminating regional conflict in the Middle East, in Central America.	0
ClaimBuster	7843	And in the meantime, they weren't going after Al Qaida, and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	7844	By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o'clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi.	0
ClaimBuster	7845	We're way behind, which means Americans can't come home.	0
ClaimBuster	7846	I don't think that is a smart strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	7847	Well, let me give you some advice.	0
ClaimBuster	7848	And if you're modest income, you're worse off.	0
ClaimBuster	7849	Now, Senator McCain is also right that it's difficult.	0
ClaimBuster	7850	In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor -- signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder.	1
ClaimBuster	7851	We'll keep the lid on some of these programs that we can hold down as we have a little extra money to spend for those quality-of-life programs which I think are needed and necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	7852	Now, I believe that in an election when we are trying to determine who should lead the free world - not just America - perhaps, as Senator Kennedy has already indicated, the most important election in our history - it isn't the label that he wears or that I wear that counts.	1
ClaimBuster	7853	We're gonna run out of oil.	0
ClaimBuster	7854	I've had one position, one consistent position, that Saddam Hussein was a threat.	1
ClaimBuster	7855	Just recently, President Rabin said that our relations were never better.	1
ClaimBuster	7856	But everybody knew what we were doing and I've opposed that.	0
ClaimBuster	7857	This is about getting the economy moving again.	0
ClaimBuster	7858	And I think you will.	0
ClaimBuster	7859	And talk to any head of any of those key committees in the Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	7860	Now, what it really boils down to is can you live -- we become so preoccupied with the rights of the criminal that we've forgotten the rights of the innocent.	0
ClaimBuster	7861	Right next to the last.	0
ClaimBuster	7862	So the fact is, let's look at our records, Senator Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	7863	Congress can't order the president around.	1
ClaimBuster	7864	And you see, I think we're facing a real opportunity for world peace.	0
ClaimBuster	7865	They're not able to do it and our future depends upon it.	1
ClaimBuster	7866	But the president's been slow to do that, even in Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	7867	Margaret, once again, I don't know which George Bush I'm talking about here or looking at.	0
ClaimBuster	7868	In the same way that you initially opposed a timetable in Afghanistan, now you're for it, although it depends.	1
ClaimBuster	7869	Now, my point is this: Senator Kennedy has got to be consistent here.	0
ClaimBuster	7870	If you're happy with the system you can stay in it.	0
ClaimBuster	7871	We use something called Race to the Top.	1
ClaimBuster	7872	I will keep Social Security in a lockbox and that pays down the national debt.	0
ClaimBuster	7873	Now that is the difference.	0
ClaimBuster	7874	He talks about a grand idea: Let's have a summit; we're going to solve the problem in Iraq by holding a summit.	1
ClaimBuster	7875	I don't really think about him very much.	0
ClaimBuster	7876	We obviously have to stop this spending spree that's going on in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	7877	There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this.	1
ClaimBuster	7878	They put about, you know, 60% of the strings where you have to fill out the paperwork.	1
ClaimBuster	7879	The United Nations was not effective at removing Saddam Hussein.	0
ClaimBuster	7880	But let's look at where I think the real mistake was made.	0
ClaimBuster	7881	[Laughter] And people will remember that you signed the biggest tax increase in the history of California and the biggest tax increase in the history of the United States, and what are you going to do?	1
ClaimBuster	7882	This uh - administration's record on environment is very bad.	0
ClaimBuster	7883	It's how we unfortunately label certain children.	1
ClaimBuster	7884	Let me tell you my position.	0
ClaimBuster	7885	And I will tell you: No, I have not.	0
ClaimBuster	7886	It becomes a tool, a corrective tool.	0
ClaimBuster	7887	We can build that bridge to the 21st Century.	0
ClaimBuster	7888	Senator McCain and I actually agree on two things that he just mentioned.	1
ClaimBuster	7889	I asked for and received the same briefing.	1
ClaimBuster	7890	Well, we have in our economic pack, -- individual retirement accounts where we think it will encourage savings.	0
ClaimBuster	7891	He said he was optimistic when he came here, then he turned on the TV and listened to the political rhetoric and all of a sudden he was pessimistic.	0
ClaimBuster	7892	And we got weapons of mass destruction crossing the border every single day, and they're blowing people up.	1
ClaimBuster	7893	The President doesn't have any ideas so he's out trashing ours.	0
ClaimBuster	7894	They will move her forward faster, and they will move her more surely than in his program.	0
ClaimBuster	7895	And Senator McCain voted for four out of five of those George Bush budgets.	1
ClaimBuster	7896	We've got battling green eye shades.	0
ClaimBuster	7897	And what I did was work with our joint chiefs of staff to think about, what are we going to need in the future to make sure that we are safe?	0
ClaimBuster	7898	We won the Olympics, in part, because we've had civil rights laws and the laws that prohibit discrimination against women.	0
ClaimBuster	7899	It has stood for a strong foreign policy and a strong national defense, and as a result, produced Wilson, President Roosevelt, and President Truman.	1
ClaimBuster	7900	I had one opportunity to nominate uh - an individual to the Supreme Court and I selected the Circuit Court of Appeals judge from Illinois, uh - John Paul Stevens.	1
ClaimBuster	7901	That has not been debunked.	1
ClaimBuster	7902	That's the only way we're going to be able to keep the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	7903	I get it down to a level below 2 percent of gross national product with a policy that's fair.	1
ClaimBuster	7904	And if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, I'll do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her.	0
ClaimBuster	7905	We have record numbers of new small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	7906	He never apologizes or says he's sorry for anything.	1
ClaimBuster	7907	Boy, to listen to that -- the president, I don't think, is living in a world of reality with respect to the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	7908	We don't have to settle for gasoline at four bucks.	0
ClaimBuster	7909	That's an example of, I think, the kind of use of the scalpel that we want to make sure that we're funding some of those programs.	0
ClaimBuster	7910	I think the experience of the twenties has shown what a free market could do to agriculture.	1
ClaimBuster	7911	.... women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.	0
ClaimBuster	7912	On the other hand, two years ago, I said that we've got a sub-prime lending crisis that has to be dealt with.	1
ClaimBuster	7913	Every parent should know what's going on there.	0
ClaimBuster	7914	He would rather spend the family's $1800 and I would rather the Strunks spend their own money.	0
ClaimBuster	7915	And I regret some of the negative aspects of both campaigns.	0
ClaimBuster	7916	It's important for our future uhh - economic security that that job be nonpolitical and uh - separate from the executive and the Legislative branches.	0
ClaimBuster	7917	Look, you have to build a consensus, but in some things -- Ross mentioned Saddam Hussein.	1
ClaimBuster	7918	We're going to make elections.	0
ClaimBuster	7919	The Governor has to balance the budget in his state he is required to by law.	1
ClaimBuster	7920	That's saying we're cutting the rates.	1
ClaimBuster	7921	We may have different approaches.	0
ClaimBuster	7922	You may have said that, too.	0
ClaimBuster	7923	I am a son of a Methodist minister.	1
ClaimBuster	7924	We can make it move.	0
ClaimBuster	7925	Because America must be able to grow enough not only to take care of our needs at home for better education and housing and health - all these things we want.	0
ClaimBuster	7926	He said a while back that the big problem with energy is that for 30 years, politicians in Washington haven't done anything.	1
ClaimBuster	7927	And finally in that 90- day period before the inauguration, put together the framework for the town hall and give the American people a Christmas present.	0
ClaimBuster	7928	This is 1980 and not 1966.	1
ClaimBuster	7929	Now, just for the record, I don't have any spin doctors.	1
ClaimBuster	7930	Your definition of national strength is to throw money at the Defense Department.	0
ClaimBuster	7931	That's what we've done, made some adjustments to it, and we're putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan...	1
ClaimBuster	7932	We have presided over the largest increase in government since the Great Society.	1
ClaimBuster	7933	Stand in the South Bronx as I did, in the spot where Jimmy Carter made his promise that he was going to, with multi-billion dollar programs, refurbish that area that looks like bombed-out London in World War II.	1
ClaimBuster	7934	I remember the night before I became Vice President.	0
ClaimBuster	7935	It has been a good, lively exchange.	0
ClaimBuster	7936	I've developed -- put out money in my budget to expand community health centers all around the country.	1
ClaimBuster	7937	That means not only military strength and our values, it also means keeping our economy strong.	0
ClaimBuster	7938	And just inevitably, they're going to be reluctant to hire Hispanics or people with a different accent.	0
ClaimBuster	7939	And frankly we have to consider what the risks are to our young men and women in uniform.	0
ClaimBuster	7940	What is an article of faith for me is not something that I can legislate on somebody who doesn't share that article of faith.	0
ClaimBuster	7941	And abroad, we're at war.	1
ClaimBuster	7942	Absolutely we've got to make sure they get educated.	0
ClaimBuster	7943	We've got plenty of lawmakers in Washington, D.C.	0
ClaimBuster	7944	But for us to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested would bring results which I know he would not want, and certainly which the American people would not want.	0
ClaimBuster	7945	And in the budget that I recommended we cut it in half - a growth rate of 5 to 5 and one-half percent.	1
ClaimBuster	7946	Chris Reeve exercises every single day to keep those muscles alive for the day when he believes he can walk again, and I want him to walk again.	1
ClaimBuster	7947	But all this by itself is not enough.	0
ClaimBuster	7948	China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	7949	I want to do something about Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	7950	We suggested -- I think it has been over a year ago now -- we do the same with Medicare, and the White House called it a gimmick.	1
ClaimBuster	7951	I've worked hard in the State of Texas to make sure our institutions reflect the state with good, smart policy.	0
ClaimBuster	7952	But I've supported Medicare ever since.	1
ClaimBuster	7953	America owes you a debt of gratitude.	0
ClaimBuster	7954	You can go around the world - and let me take Israel for example.	0
ClaimBuster	7955	I urged the president to support this air cover, and he did--and I applaud that.	1
ClaimBuster	7956	Well, first I have to say one thing, very important.	0
ClaimBuster	7957	The matter has been thoroughly looked into.	0
ClaimBuster	7958	That's been a consistent policy, one I intend to carry out.	0
ClaimBuster	7959	He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings.	1
ClaimBuster	7960	They're a member of the axis of evil.	0
ClaimBuster	7961	And I want to make sure the outcome honors that nobility.	0
ClaimBuster	7962	I know that the CIA is already going forward with one.	1
ClaimBuster	7963	It would ruin the quality of health care in America.	0
ClaimBuster	7964	It ought to be a quiet strength based on the integrity of our people, the vision of the Constitution, an in- innate strong will and purpose that God's given us in the greatest nation on earth - the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	7965	"First thing I'm going to do,"" despite the fact that it's the same health care plan that he passed in Massachusetts and is working well."	1
ClaimBuster	7966	And I will invest in education, health care, protecting the environment and retirement security.	0
ClaimBuster	7967	General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we're doing in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	7968	The consequences of defeat would have been increased Iranian influence.	0
ClaimBuster	7969	I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	7970	Four years in a row, Democrats and Republicans came together to balance the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	7971	We have achieved a five and three quarter year uh - sale of a minimum six million metric tons, which means that they have already bought about four million metric tons this year and are bound to buy another two million metric tons to take the grain and corn and wheat that the American farmers have produced in order to uh - have full production.	1
ClaimBuster	7972	Maybe that explains why Medicare patients are complaining about being pushed off of Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	7973	We're going to make it affordable and accessible.	0
ClaimBuster	7974	They don't want us to control it, very candidly.	0
ClaimBuster	7975	Maybe someone would call it a character trait, maybe somebody wouldn't.	0
ClaimBuster	7976	And I will do everything that's required to prevent it.	0
ClaimBuster	7977	And we've got to get the financial package working much quicker than it has been working.	0
ClaimBuster	7978	And I wish I had been wrong for the sake of the country and they had been right, but that's not the case.	0
ClaimBuster	7979	I know how to win.	0
ClaimBuster	7980	By the way, my friend, Dr. Kissinger, who's been my friend for 35 years, would be interested to hear this conversation and Senator Obama's depiction of his -- of his positions on the issue.	1
ClaimBuster	7981	Number three, we've got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes.	0
ClaimBuster	7982	Well, of course I don't concur with what the president said about my own record and the things that I've said.	0
ClaimBuster	7983	I believe the United States is at peace tonight in part because of the disciplined, careful, effective deployment of our military resources.	0
ClaimBuster	7984	We have inflation because the Government is living too well.	0
ClaimBuster	7985	The Russians have a lot of sway in that part of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	7986	I'd like to mention one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	7987	We've got to put an end to that.	0
ClaimBuster	7988	"I don't think it's enough for Senator Kennedy to go before the audiences on the Democratic side and say, ""Vote for me because I'm a Democrat."""	0
ClaimBuster	7989	But you know why the Pell Grants have gone up in their numbers?	0
ClaimBuster	7990	The question of Communism within the United States has been one that has worried us in the past.	0
ClaimBuster	7991	(APPLAUSE) And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women.	0
ClaimBuster	7992	My word is my bond.	0
ClaimBuster	7993	Because our energy is low cost, that are already beginning to come back because of our abundant energy.	1
ClaimBuster	7994	And I think the figures that he has given are simply not going to stand up.	0
ClaimBuster	7995	I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.	0
ClaimBuster	7996	And he will not advise me in the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	7997	I've done more to eliminate Affirmative Action programs I didn't think were fair and tighten others up than my predecessors have, since affirmative action's been around.	1
ClaimBuster	7998	You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators.	1
ClaimBuster	7999	And now I listen how she's going to get rid of ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	8000	We also need to hold on to equal pay.	0
ClaimBuster	8001	They are -- the conspicuousness of their presence is only matched by our absence, because we've been focused on Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	8002	I want to give every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit.	0
ClaimBuster	8003	You've been through the roughest weeks anybody could imagine.	0
ClaimBuster	8004	I think my programs are far less inflationary than those of Governor Reagan.	0
ClaimBuster	8005	If you reduce the out-go of Social Security, that money would not go into the general fund to reduce a deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	8006	But let me just tell you my position on guns in general, sir, if you don't mind.	0
ClaimBuster	8007	Look at all these women Senate candidates we have here.	0
ClaimBuster	8008	But I've always said trickle-down government is bad.	1
ClaimBuster	8009	My priority is putting people back to work in America.	0
ClaimBuster	8010	And that's what's happening in Afghanistan and Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	8011	During the Depression era, we had a thing called the home ownership loan corporation.	1
ClaimBuster	8012	I don't believe Mr. Perot feels this way, but I know Governor Clinton did because I want to accurately quote him.	0
ClaimBuster	8013	We haven't got 12 days, folks.	0
ClaimBuster	8014	And that's why the FDA and that's why the surgeon general are looking very carefully to make sure it can be done in a safe way.	1
ClaimBuster	8015	Then we went in with the multinational force to help remove, and did remove, more than 13,000 of those terrorists from Lebanon.	1
ClaimBuster	8016	"When Senator Obama was first asked, he said, ""Any place, any time,"" the way Barry Goldwater and Jack Kennedy agreed to do, before the intervention of the tragedy at Dallas."	1
ClaimBuster	8017	And what that's going to do is a disaster for the country.	0
ClaimBuster	8018	And, you know, I was raised by a single mom who had to put herself through school while looking after two kids.	1
ClaimBuster	8019	Well, if you're wealthy, you're better off.	0
ClaimBuster	8020	This is an - a typical example, maybe of many others, where this administration overthrew an elected government and helped to establish a military dictatorship.	1
ClaimBuster	8021	Put a head fake on us.	0
ClaimBuster	8022	We - I mean in Korea - we had uh - three million five hundred thousand young men uh - in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines.	1
ClaimBuster	8023	It happened because I could work with people -- Republicans and Democrats.	1
ClaimBuster	8024	Again, if you're not rich, you're not a superpower.	0
ClaimBuster	8025	The President has always maintained and very properly so that he is entitled to get what advice he wants from his cabinet and from his other advisers without disclosing that to anybody - including as a matter of fact the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	8026	You see, I want the families to have the choice.	0
ClaimBuster	8027	We have written agreements and we have some missiles that have been destroyed, but we have a huge number of intercontinental ballistic missiles that are still in place in Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	8028	Can we say, really say that we will be better off when we pull away from sort of that basic American instinct of decency and fairness?	0
ClaimBuster	8029	President Truman vetoed on the average, while he was president, about thirty-eight bills a year.	1
ClaimBuster	8030	Secondly, we passed a federal aid to education bill in the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	8031	And we've got too much government and too much spending and the government is -- the size of government has grown by 40 percent in the last eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	8032	This is a race between the Vice President and myself for the presidency of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	8033	But younger workers, in order to make sure the system exists tomorrow, younger workers ought to be able to take some of your own money and invest it in safe securities to get a better rate of return on that money.	0
ClaimBuster	8034	And then we made it plain, a second phase, take up the submarine-launched or the airborne missiles.	1
ClaimBuster	8035	We are sitting on a ticking time bomb folks, because we have totally mismanaged our country, and we had better get it back under control.	0
ClaimBuster	8036	So what that means is that we can't simply drill our way out of the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	8037	I believe that many of the things they have done are evil in any concept of morality that we have.	0
ClaimBuster	8038	"It isn't enough for him to say ""I support the President's position, that I voted for the resolution."""	0
ClaimBuster	8039	And let me add the word safety; it must be done with the utmost of safety.	0
ClaimBuster	8040	Everybody who pays taxes ought to get some relief.	0
ClaimBuster	8041	I think we ought to be looking at modernization, I think we ought to be exploring less expensive ways to get it on land, and we ought to make sure that we have an effective and strong and credible nuclear deterrent.	0
ClaimBuster	8042	I've been involved myself in negotiating and helping to move along the negotiations with the Internet service providers to get a parents' protection page every time 95% of the pages come up.	1
ClaimBuster	8043	We've got seven and a half million people out of jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	8044	And believe me, this country thinks it's -- really thinks it's disgraceful, also.	0
ClaimBuster	8045	And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	8046	All I say is this.	0
ClaimBuster	8047	Bill and that allowed him to go to college, that wasn't a handout.	1
ClaimBuster	8048	Morton, I did criticize the President because of our undercutting of what was a stalwart ally -- the Shah of Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	8049	I would pick somebody who would not allow their personal opinion to get in the way of the law.	0
ClaimBuster	8050	I am not going to commit US forces until I know what the mission is, till the military tell me that it can be completed, and till I know how they can come out.	0
ClaimBuster	8051	And Iran now is more dangerous, and so is North Korea, with nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	8052	And there are folks out there who've been struggling before this crisis took place.	1
ClaimBuster	8053	People look to the President of the United States more than any other person in America.	0
ClaimBuster	8054	Now looking to what we ought to do in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	8055	I think this is the wrong direction.	0
ClaimBuster	8056	We've got to do it in a responsible way by cutting out spending we don't need, but also asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more.	0
ClaimBuster	8057	So that is where my income limit would trigger.	0
ClaimBuster	8058	But we can't kill our way out of this mess.	0
ClaimBuster	8059	And we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have.	0
ClaimBuster	8060	Look, Dr. Kissinger did not say that he would approve of face-to- face meetings between the president of the United States and the president -- and Ahmadinejad.	1
ClaimBuster	8061	And then, as we build up our national security, to restore our margin of safety, we at the same time try to restrain the Soviet build-up, which has been going forward at a rapid pace, and for quite some time.	1
ClaimBuster	8062	So, you know, she shouldn't be talking about that.	0
ClaimBuster	8063	He's got four times the size of the deficits that Mr. Nixon even had himself.	1
ClaimBuster	8064	I don't think it's a good thing.	0
ClaimBuster	8065	Now, that runs counter to what the United States of America is all about at our core.	0
ClaimBuster	8066	What we did in a legislature 87 percent Democrat, we worked together; 200 legislators in my legislature, only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished.	1
ClaimBuster	8067	And that's why the plan that I've put forward for manufacturing and education, and reducing our deficit in a sensible way, using the savings from ending wars, to rebuild America and putting people back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	8068	She didn't even know what that word -- what that letter meant.	0
ClaimBuster	8069	I never thought I'd ever be involved in anything like this.	0
ClaimBuster	8070	You're judged by the entire record.	0
ClaimBuster	8071	I don't like to see the country's principles violated.	0
ClaimBuster	8072	And this is the greatest country on Earth.	0
ClaimBuster	8073	But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he's offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there's no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who's got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	8074	And I want to go through the federal budget line by line, page by page, programs that don't work, we should cut.	0
ClaimBuster	8075	Well, thank you for the question.	0
ClaimBuster	8076	There isn't a single American diplomatic representative in any of those six.	1
ClaimBuster	8077	I think she's a terrific person...	0
ClaimBuster	8078	You went out and tried to cut $20 billion out of Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	8079	This is because younger people might be able to get health insurance for $5,000, young and healthy folks.	1
ClaimBuster	8080	What I don't accept is demonstrating and organizing demonstrations in a foreign country when your country's at war.	0
ClaimBuster	8081	By the way, when I'm subcommittee chairman, we take up the issues under my subcommittee.	0
ClaimBuster	8082	... that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race.	1
ClaimBuster	8083	(Laughter) And so our America 2000 program also says this.	0
ClaimBuster	8084	He has been watching ads of Senator McCain's.	1
ClaimBuster	8085	We don't have to be an adversary in any way, shape or form.	0
ClaimBuster	8086	The third thing I would say -- it doesn't bear directly on gun control, but it's very important -- we need more police on the street.	0
ClaimBuster	8087	We were on one side; they were on the other side.	1
ClaimBuster	8088	Their families care deeply about them, want them back and understandably so and we want to do everything we can to bring them back.	0
ClaimBuster	8089	I think it shows the difference between the two parties.	0
ClaimBuster	8090	And I won't do one other thing that he's had to do: took $29 million out of his state pension fund that's equivalent at the federal level of taking out of the Social Security trust fund.	1
ClaimBuster	8091	Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries.	0
ClaimBuster	8092	We opened a great opportunity in l972, which has pretty well been frittered - frit- frittered away under Mr. Ford, that ought to be a constant uh - inclination toward - uh - toward friendship.	0
ClaimBuster	8093	My plan is to bring down rates, but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people working.	0
ClaimBuster	8094	That's how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	8095	And we're of course going to have to consider the costs.	0
ClaimBuster	8096	But I do think this, that the next president, even within a relatively stable budget and that's what we are going to have for the foreseeable future will have to make those tough choices that I was talking about and that Mr. Bush doesn't seem to want to make.	0
ClaimBuster	8097	The future will be the greatest time in this country's history if we can beat this division that is bedeviling the whole rest of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	8098	Well, I hope I made my answer clear.	0
ClaimBuster	8099	And that would permit us to deal with the developing nations in a position of strength.	0
ClaimBuster	8100	I propose a real prescription drug benefit under Medicare for all seniors, all seniors, and here's how it works.	0
ClaimBuster	8101	So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested -- a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago, suggested that we appoint a commission.	1
ClaimBuster	8102	You don't measure it by a percentage increase.	0
ClaimBuster	8103	Same with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	8104	There is more oil now, in the wells that have been drilled, than has been taken out in 121 years that they've been drilled.	1
ClaimBuster	8105	I do know what he has said about mine.	1
ClaimBuster	8106	There will be a job-sucking sound going south.	0
ClaimBuster	8107	We rank first in the country in job growth, we got the lowest spending, state and local, in the country, and the 2nd lowest tax burden.	1
ClaimBuster	8108	There's not a more important issue.	0
ClaimBuster	8109	And three-quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people.	1
ClaimBuster	8110	Well, let me just say -- let me just say.	0
ClaimBuster	8111	And they've done a wonderful job, and they've been wonderful, wonderful kids.	0
ClaimBuster	8112	I want to change those provisions.	0
ClaimBuster	8113	There is social, economic progress, and a strategy, a strategy of going into an area, clearing and holding, and the people of the country then become allied with you.	0
ClaimBuster	8114	We agree on a couple of things on education.	1
ClaimBuster	8115	And the president chose the wrong way.	0
ClaimBuster	8116	We need a hundred thousand more police on the street.	0
ClaimBuster	8117	And that would relieve an enormous amount of pressure.	0
ClaimBuster	8118	First of all, although we are today, as Senator Kennedy has admitted, the strongest nation in the world militarily, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have - if the should launch a surprise attack - we will be able to destroy their war-making capability.	1
ClaimBuster	8119	Let me go back a minute to racial divisiveness.	0
ClaimBuster	8120	There is a difference with what the president did in Kosovo which I supported and this.	1
ClaimBuster	8121	In the last five pres- vice presidential uh - nominees, uh - incumbents, three of them have become president.	1
ClaimBuster	8122	They'll never be the same.	0
ClaimBuster	8123	Now with regard to Cuba, let me make one thing clear.	0
ClaimBuster	8124	We've got to join with the British and the French, with the Germans, who've been involved, in their initiative.	1
ClaimBuster	8125	The Vice President is right, by the way.	0
ClaimBuster	8126	Now those are the wrong priorities.	0
ClaimBuster	8127	I would hope that as we move to one area of the world from another - and the United States must not spread itself too thinly - that was one of the problems that helped to create the circumstances in Vietnam - but as we as a nation find that we are asked by the various parties, either one nation against another or individuals within a nation, that the United States will take the leadership and try to resolve the differences.	0
ClaimBuster	8128	And I believe that instead of talking about Soviet progress, we can talk about American successes.	0
ClaimBuster	8129	Actually, I understand it pretty well.	0
ClaimBuster	8130	I was the floor manager.	1
ClaimBuster	8131	Surely we can send 5% back to you that pay the bills.	0
ClaimBuster	8132	If you pay any tax at all, you got tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	8133	That is an outrageous claim.	0
ClaimBuster	8134	Every debate I bring this up, and nobody ever addresses it.	1
ClaimBuster	8135	If we had that many more people in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and Marines, our unemployment figure would be considerably less.	0
ClaimBuster	8136	As a matter of fact, I brought Republicans and Democrats together to do just that in the State of Texas to get a patient's bill of rights through.	1
ClaimBuster	8137	One I don't have a list yet.	0
ClaimBuster	8138	And I'm going to spend what it takes to win the war, more than just $120 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	8139	It's called the automated check or the instant check.	1
ClaimBuster	8140	No HMO or insurance company can take those choices away from you.	0
ClaimBuster	8141	And if you think I was proud of it, I think you misread me, I do.	0
ClaimBuster	8142	First of all, we hear that our prestige is at an all-time low.	0
ClaimBuster	8143	Now, Social Security has never done that.	1
ClaimBuster	8144	We want -- we want to make sure that we're seeing progress throughout the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	8145	First, we ought to prevent more of this on the street.	0
ClaimBuster	8146	We find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	8147	Governor Carter uh - apparently doesn't realize that since I've been president we have sold to the Israelis over $4 billion in military hardware.	1
ClaimBuster	8148	But I think that it's important to recognize that there are things that can be done short of that, and that we do have interests there.	0
ClaimBuster	8149	We're spending $1 billion to come up with the technologies to do that.	1
ClaimBuster	8150	And they're showing up in Iraq for the same reason.	0
ClaimBuster	8151	Well, I try to articulate my positions as clearly as possible, tell people what I stand for and let them decide whether they're going to support me or not.	0
ClaimBuster	8152	But let's look at the facts here.	0
ClaimBuster	8153	From 50,000 down, those people paid two-thirds of the taxes, and those people got two-thirds of the tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	8154	We need to deal with managed care.	0
ClaimBuster	8155	It would be catastrophic if the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board became the tool of the political uh - party that was in power.	0
ClaimBuster	8156	We need to know the full extent of Senator Obama's relationship with ACORN, who is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy.	1
ClaimBuster	8157	And so does Michael Feinberg.	0
ClaimBuster	8158	It helped lead me through a war, leads me today.	0
ClaimBuster	8159	Drug counselors out there in the street who are providing help to youngsters who come up to me and others who ask for help and want help, are doing the hard work, the heroic work, which it takes to provide that kind of leadership, that kind of counseling, that kind of support.	1
ClaimBuster	8160	What's he say to Alexander Kwasniewski of Poland?	0
ClaimBuster	8161	We need to restore the faith and the trust of the American people in their own government.	0
ClaimBuster	8162	And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow.	0
ClaimBuster	8163	"I -- well, maybe they say, ""Well, it was a youthful indiscretion."""	0
ClaimBuster	8164	She never got a college education, even though she was smart as a whip.	1
ClaimBuster	8165	You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country.	1
ClaimBuster	8166	What we do in this country, the kind of society that we build, that will tell whether freedom will be sustained around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	8167	I'm just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election, but that's how Donald thinks.	0
ClaimBuster	8168	We don't have to settle for, how many months, 43 months with unemployment above 8 percent, 23 million Americans struggling to find a good job right now.	1
ClaimBuster	8169	Yes, and I'm certain many, many Americans were turned off by the revelations of Watergate, a very, very uh - bad period of time in American political history.	0
ClaimBuster	8170	So we're making dramatic progress.	0
ClaimBuster	8171	You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good.	0
ClaimBuster	8172	Ultimately, the most serious terrorist threat is if one of those radical nations, who believe in terrorism as a policy, should have atomic weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	8173	That's what this race is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	8174	If we do those things, we can build that bridge to the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	8175	I think our Cabinet members are key people.	0
ClaimBuster	8176	She won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name.	0
ClaimBuster	8177	I think the essential strategy of the United States ought not accept any Soviet control over Eastern Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	8178	"I don't want to see the kiddie pornographic laws repealed; I don't want to see ""under God"" come out from our currency."	0
ClaimBuster	8179	If you've got health care already, and probably the majority of you do, then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it.	0
ClaimBuster	8180	Incomes went up for everybody.	1
ClaimBuster	8181	We need to rebuild our alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	8182	He had bilateral talks with the North Koreans.	1
ClaimBuster	8183	Let's go back in terms of accepting responsibility for your actions.	0
ClaimBuster	8184	It was wrong for the country and calling it conservative won't make it right.	0
ClaimBuster	8185	Don't talk about growth, because even though we need growth, that's not helping.	0
ClaimBuster	8186	Because the problem in America today to a large extent, Tom, is that we don't have trust and confidence in our institutions because of the corruption on Wall Street and the greed and excess and the cronyism in Washington, D.C.	1
ClaimBuster	8187	I signed a bill to stop these drive-by deliveries when insurance companies can force people out of the hospital after 24 hours and I vetoed Senator Dole's Medicare plan that would have forced a lot of seniors into managed care and taken a lot more money out of their pockets and led to Medicare withering on the vine.	1
ClaimBuster	8188	I few have experience and now how to handle it, but please do not go back to the days when the military was as weak as they could be, when the morale was down, and when we were the laughing stock around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	8189	It is time to have a new commander in chief who will rebuild the military, pay our men and women more, make sure they're housed better and have a focused mission for our military.	0
ClaimBuster	8190	Because we cut taxes on everybody -- remember, we ran up the child credit by $1,000, we reduced the marriage penalty, we created a 10 percent bracket, everybody who pays taxes got relief -- the recession was one of the shortest in our nation's history.	1
ClaimBuster	8191	And I didn't wilt and I didn't quit.	1
ClaimBuster	8192	And here I believe basically that what we have to do is to stimulate that sector of America, the private enterprise sector of the economy, in which there is the greatest possibility for expansion.	0
ClaimBuster	8193	He said, no, she has leukemia, acute leukemia, a few weeks to live.	1
ClaimBuster	8194	And the reason is, because I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well.	0
ClaimBuster	8195	Or do you just keep lunging in at will?	0
ClaimBuster	8196	We don't want to overreact, as the federal regulators have in my judgment, on good banks so that they've created credit crunches, that is, they have made our recession worse in the last couple of years -- but we do want to act prudently with the banks that are in trouble.	1
ClaimBuster	8197	As I said the other night, I hope a lot of them lose because they're liberal Democrats --	0
ClaimBuster	8198	In my opinion this is the same kind of woolly thinking that led to disaster for America in Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	8199	Vladimir is going to have to make some hard choices.	0
ClaimBuster	8200	He said I want to take it from the rich, raise $150 billion from the rich.	1
ClaimBuster	8201	Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims.	0
ClaimBuster	8202	The 50 governors of this nation have proposed to the Congress that we help those families to get off of welfare, help those youngsters, help their mothers to become independent and self-sufficient.	1
ClaimBuster	8203	He has vetoed bills passed by Congress within the congressional budget guidelines job opportunities for two million Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	8204	But let me tell you, you know, this business about bombing Iran and all that, let me tell you my record.	0
ClaimBuster	8205	Now whether or not he'll do that again I've heard some of the people say, well, that's the model we ought to use and if he's reelected maybe he will come back and try it again.	0
ClaimBuster	8206	We had family leave in our office, I'm certain.	1
ClaimBuster	8207	Now, I've outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement at home and abroad, doubling the number of drug enforcement agents, having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th of January when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together.	1
ClaimBuster	8208	You said that we should still have troops in Iraq to this day.	1
ClaimBuster	8209	And let me explain why.	0
ClaimBuster	8210	So to answer your question, I support, I guess the way to put it, is affirmative access.	0
ClaimBuster	8211	I had something very nice to say in there.	0
ClaimBuster	8212	Let me see where to start here.	0
ClaimBuster	8213	I think something this big, this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis.	0
ClaimBuster	8214	Very early in my administration I proposed -- and I think something that had never been proposed by any previous administration -- I proposed a total elimination of intermediate-range missiles, where the Soviets had better than a 10 -- and still have -- better than a 10-to-1 advantage over the allies in Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	8215	Houston has just become the smoggiest city in the country.	1
ClaimBuster	8216	Our initial military success, we went in to Baghdad and everybody celebrated.	0
ClaimBuster	8217	Well, that vote wasn't exactly -- a lot of the supporters of the Kyoto Treaty actually ended up voting for that because the way it was worded.	1
ClaimBuster	8218	And I'm certainly not going to say to him, I'll give you more flexibility after the election.	0
ClaimBuster	8219	We need to cut the business tax rate in America.	0
ClaimBuster	8220	Syria is Russia and it's Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly.	0
ClaimBuster	8221	Well, keep in mind our strategy wasn't just going after bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	8222	Because -- because this is important.	0
ClaimBuster	8223	Of course it's on the table.	0
ClaimBuster	8224	There has never been a country on Earth that saw its economy decline and yet maintained its military superiority.	1
ClaimBuster	8225	"Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is ""Make America Great Again,"" I wonder when he thought America was great."	1
ClaimBuster	8226	And as for the surest way to threaten our prosperity, having a $1.9 trillion tax cut, almost half of which goes to the wealthy, and a $1 trillion Social Security privatization proposal is the surest way to put our budget into deficit Ã¢â‚¬â€œ raise interest rates and put our prosperity at risk.	1
ClaimBuster	8227	Expediting drugs through the FDA makes sense, of course.	0
ClaimBuster	8228	On the north they have North Korea with five hundred thousand well-trained, well-equipped troops - they are supported by the People's Republic of China; they are supported by the Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	8229	There is a problem for our youngsters, a real problem.	0
ClaimBuster	8230	One of the major responsibilities on the shoulders of uh - New York City is to - is to finance welfare.	1
ClaimBuster	8231	These are people that kill women and treat women horribly.	1
ClaimBuster	8232	And we must do whatever we can to prevent genocide, whatever we can to prevent these terrible calamities that we have said never again.	0
ClaimBuster	8233	And uh - it would be of - of tremendous benefit in long-range planning, in tight budgeting, uh saving the taxpayers' money, making the government more efficient, cutting down on bureaucratic waste, having a clear delineation of authority and responsibility of employees, and giving our people a better chance to understand and control their government.	0
ClaimBuster	8234	We are a government by the people, and when we move, it should be for very severe and extreme reasons that serve our national interests and end up with a stronger country behind us.	0
ClaimBuster	8235	We, of course, don't want to have automatic weapons, and that's already illegal in this country to have automatic weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	8236	But we're always also going to have to maintain vigilance when it comes to terrorist activities.	0
ClaimBuster	8237	I wouldn't have supported either.	0
ClaimBuster	8238	Syria -- Syria's not just a tragedy of 30,000 civilians being killed by a military, but also a strategic -- strategically significant player for America.	1
ClaimBuster	8239	We've come through a recession, a stock market decline, an attack on our country.	1
ClaimBuster	8240	We don't have to settle for 50 percent of kids coming out of college not able to get work.	1
ClaimBuster	8241	I wouldn't relish doing it but I wouldn't shrink from it.	0
ClaimBuster	8242	I've also advocated that we stop the sale by Germany and France of - processing plants for Pakistan and Brazil.	1
ClaimBuster	8243	Well, Jim, the FDA took 12 years, and I do support that decision.	1
ClaimBuster	8244	Going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today.	0
ClaimBuster	8245	Surely we can work together to create a cultural life so some of these youngsters who feel like they can take a neighbor's life with a gun will understand that that's not the way America is meant to be.	0
ClaimBuster	8246	See, I think you can be realistic and optimistic at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	8247	I'm for an investment tax allowance; I'm for a tax break for first- time homebuyers.	0
ClaimBuster	8248	I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience.	0
ClaimBuster	8249	I mean, women know what's it like to be paid an unequal amount for equal work.	0
ClaimBuster	8250	And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they're doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business.	0
ClaimBuster	8251	He voted for the energy bill that was full of goodies for the oil companies that I opposed.	1
ClaimBuster	8252	I'd be honored and humbled.	0
ClaimBuster	8253	Well, I have to respond.	0
ClaimBuster	8254	And I know the president will join me in welcoming all of Florida to this debate.	0
ClaimBuster	8255	I thought the Oregon plan should at least have been allowed to be tried because at least the people in Oregon were trying to do something.	0
ClaimBuster	8256	The second, you've got your big companies that are in trouble, including the defense industries--have another one on that.	0
ClaimBuster	8257	You've set up a Strategic Defense Initiative, an agency, you're beginning to test, you're talking about deploying, you're asking for a budget of some $30 billion for this purpose.	1
ClaimBuster	8258	And so, look, I'm going to -- what you need to know about me is I will uphold the law, I'm going to have an attorney general that enforces the law.	0
ClaimBuster	8259	We need to help the Pakistani government go into Waziristan, where I visited, a very rough country, and -- and get the support of the people, and get them to work with us and turn against the cruel Taliban and others.	1
ClaimBuster	8260	I don't think it's possible for Mr. Nixon to state the record in distortion of the facts with more precision than he just did.	0
ClaimBuster	8261	A President must know the essential facts essential to command.	0
ClaimBuster	8262	There is going to be hundreds of experiments off the 22 lines that now exist that are active, and hopefully we find a cure.	1
ClaimBuster	8263	That's called business, by the way.	0
ClaimBuster	8264	They're not going to be solved overnight.	0
ClaimBuster	8265	He's been in the United States Senate for 20 years and he hasn't addressed it.	1
ClaimBuster	8266	I believe that the opposite is true with President Ford's campaign, and uh - I hope that we can leave those issues in this next ten days about personalities and mistakes of the past - we've both made some mistakes - and talk about unemployment, inflation, housing, education, taxation, government organization, stripping away of secrecy, and the things that are crucial to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	8267	A little experience, a little age, a little intelligence.	0
ClaimBuster	8268	We'll have an opportunity to see the two of them in action in a friendly forum, wonderful friendly fashion like this.	0
ClaimBuster	8269	Now so that we get it absolutely clear: Senator Kennedy must as a candidate - as I as a candidate in fifty-two - criticize us when we're wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	8270	Is the behavior you're using prone to cause AIDS?	0
ClaimBuster	8271	26 days from today you and millions of Americans will choose two people to lead us into the future as president and vice president of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	8272	It could reduce Saddam Hussein's abilities to threaten Kuwait and his other neighbors again.	0
ClaimBuster	8273	People are pouring into our country, and they're coming in from the Middle East and other places.	1
ClaimBuster	8274	And when you look at what you are proposing...	0
ClaimBuster	8275	Bob, let me just respond.	0
ClaimBuster	8276	Now, just a comment on Senator Kennedy's last answer.	0
ClaimBuster	8277	In order to make sure people have jobs for the 21st century, we've got to get it right in the education system, and we're beginning to close a minority achievement gap now.	0
ClaimBuster	8278	It's not going to happen on its own.	0
ClaimBuster	8279	We're going to ask you to show us whether or not -- we ask you to post the results on the Internet.	0
ClaimBuster	8280	If you take it out of the surplus in the trust fund, that means the trust fund goes bankrupt in this generation within 20 years.	1
ClaimBuster	8281	We have considered inflation in our figures.	1
ClaimBuster	8282	The measurement is not: Are we safer?	0
ClaimBuster	8283	I'm going to let him keep his wealth.	0
ClaimBuster	8284	And I've heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there's been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims.	1
ClaimBuster	8285	Now on the question of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, I must say that I feel that another effort should be made by a new Administration in January of 1961, to renew negotiations with the Soviet Union and see whether it's possible to come to some conclusion which will lessen the chances of contamination of the atmosphere, and also lessen the chances that other powers will begin to possess a nuclear capacity.	0
ClaimBuster	8286	"I was in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm and she said, ""I've been out of work since May."	1
ClaimBuster	8287	Has made him a part of our foreign policy and has been funneling aid to Contras through convicted drug dealers.Ã¢â€°Â¤	1
ClaimBuster	8288	I strongly support local control, so does Governor Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	8289	But for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring.	0
ClaimBuster	8290	In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself.	0
ClaimBuster	8291	Am I wrong about that?	0
ClaimBuster	8292	I'm really excited about getting it done, too.	0
ClaimBuster	8293	And the way we're going to get it done is we're going to have a brand new Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	8294	We have to bet on the future and move beyond the current technologies to have a whole new generation of more efficient, cleaner, energy technology.	0
ClaimBuster	8295	When the original treaty was signed back in the early 1900s, when Theodore Roosevelt was president, Panama retained sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone.	1
ClaimBuster	8296	... to -- to -- to...	0
ClaimBuster	8297	That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	8298	Again and again and again, the mother disappears in 3 days, and the child becomes a ward of the state because he's permanently and genetically damaged.	0
ClaimBuster	8299	We'll deny sanctuary to these terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	8300	One of the biggest problems today is that the countries to our south are so desperately poor that these people who will almost lose their lives if they don't come north, come north despite all the risks.	0
ClaimBuster	8301	He also indicates as far as his agricultural program is concerned that he feels it will cost less than ours.	1
ClaimBuster	8302	And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years I've been in public service.	1
ClaimBuster	8303	There will be no unilateral disarmament under my administration.	0
ClaimBuster	8304	I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	8305	And I've never seen a presidential campaign where the presidential nominee runs against my vice presidential nominee; never seen one before.	0
ClaimBuster	8306	I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession.	0
ClaimBuster	8307	Now, I have a basic disagreement with Senator Kennedy, though, on this point.	0
ClaimBuster	8308	I'm using the same words that your advisers use.	0
ClaimBuster	8309	But, you know, it's gotten to be about $122 difference.	1
ClaimBuster	8310	There are 200,000 people unemployed in California alone because we have cut defense without planning to retrain them and to reinvest in the technologies of the future here at home.	1
ClaimBuster	8311	Now, just because we don't want to get involved everywhere doesn't mean we should back off anywhere it comes up.	0
ClaimBuster	8312	Those things would revolutionize American education and take us to the top economically.	0
ClaimBuster	8313	Because the trillion dollars that has been promised to young people has also been promised to older people.	1
ClaimBuster	8314	You talk about the Brady Bill.	0
ClaimBuster	8315	And I -- I don't blame the administration for the fact that the relationship with Pakistan is strained.	1
ClaimBuster	8316	There's only one way out of this, and that is to stop the deterioration of our job base, to have a growing, expanding job base, to give us the tax base -- see, balancing the budget is not nearly as difficult as paying off the $4 trillion debt and leaving our children the American dream intact.	0
ClaimBuster	8317	Well, It seems to me that uh - we have a chance - the Republicans - to get a majority in the House of Representatives.	0
ClaimBuster	8318	Because that's the way we elect a president in this country, and it's the way we should.	0
ClaimBuster	8319	Because I understand the stakes of this war on terror.	0
ClaimBuster	8320	They look at the fact that we owe 'em a trillion dollars and owe other people $16 trillion in total, including that.	1
ClaimBuster	8321	I talked to an African-American police officer in Springfield, Massachusetts not long ago who raised this question and said that in his opinion one of the biggest solutions is in the training.	1
ClaimBuster	8322	He believes, like I believe, that the Iraqis are ready to fight for their own freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	8323	Let me give you the example of Mexico.	0
ClaimBuster	8324	Small businesses are not going to have a mandate.	0
ClaimBuster	8325	So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	8326	Secondly, I think that the Burger Court has fairly well confirmed the major and - and most far-reaching and most controversial decisions of the Warren Court.	0
ClaimBuster	8327	In other words, we've had a huge increase of about $.50 a gallon since that time, and all of that increase has gone out of this country - or much of it - into the pockets of OPEC oil producers.	1
ClaimBuster	8328	That will help us maintain the kind of American leadership that we need.	0
ClaimBuster	8329	And this particular bill, it allows patients to choose a doctor, their own doctor if they want to.	1
ClaimBuster	8330	And when it comes to tightening sanctions, look, as I said before, we've put in the toughest, most crippling sanctions ever.	1
ClaimBuster	8331	I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be allowed to protect themselves and their families.	0
ClaimBuster	8332	I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion in a deal for an Air Force tanker that was done in a corrupt fashion.	1
ClaimBuster	8333	I want to keep this economic recovery going.	0
ClaimBuster	8334	We're going to be able to.	0
ClaimBuster	8335	So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS.	1
ClaimBuster	8336	Now, I can only say this.	0
ClaimBuster	8337	Quotas are bad for America.	0
ClaimBuster	8338	How much for my family?	0
ClaimBuster	8339	But I've got confidence in my country.	0
ClaimBuster	8340	I wanted to make it more effective and efficient.	0
ClaimBuster	8341	And I think there has to be -- I think Mr. Perot and I agree on this, there has to be a national commission of health care providers and health care consumers that set ceilings to keep health costs in line with inflation, plus population growth.	0
ClaimBuster	8342	Now that isn't the test of whether America moves.	0
ClaimBuster	8343	I will not agree to another debate.	0
ClaimBuster	8344	I think if you really believe that the people of a state ought to make a decision on a matter of this kind that uh - we ought to have a federal constitutional amendment that would permit each one of the fifty states to make the choice.	0
ClaimBuster	8345	And Mr. Bush is right - the two go hand in hand.	0
ClaimBuster	8346	"The Communists say, ""Come with us; look what we've done."""	1
ClaimBuster	8347	And this is your plan, John.	0
ClaimBuster	8348	And, in fact, we just found out that AIG, a company that got a bailout, just a week after they got help went on a $400,000 junket.	1
ClaimBuster	8349	And I -- and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan, he's -- some ideas he's put forward on Race to the Top, not all of them, but some of them I agree with and -- and congratulate him for pursuing that.	0
ClaimBuster	8350	It's your strength, it's your values, it's the quality of the people you pick.	0
ClaimBuster	8351	He declared the need for a new tax cut for the oil companies in Texas an emergency need, and so the money was taken away from the CHIP program.	1
ClaimBuster	8352	I think there're several reasons.	0
ClaimBuster	8353	But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	8354	For years, she had been getting paid less than a man had been paid for doing the exact same job.	1
ClaimBuster	8355	We still have them on, on some things.	1
ClaimBuster	8356	But I don't think the IMF ought to be a stop loss for people who ought to be able to evaluate risks themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	8357	Airplane hijacking was one of the elements of that commitment.	1
ClaimBuster	8358	We provide for managed competition, not government models, in every states.	0
ClaimBuster	8359	We -- we make decisions today in the military that -- that will confront challenges we can't imagine.	0
ClaimBuster	8360	We're going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital.	0
ClaimBuster	8361	Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries.	1
ClaimBuster	8362	About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they're going to attack Mosul.	1
ClaimBuster	8363	Benefits were not affected at all.	1
ClaimBuster	8364	And uh - the Playboy thing has been of great - very great concern to me.	0
ClaimBuster	8365	We went to the UN, we made historic resolutions up there, the whole world was united, our Congress was dragging its feet.	1
ClaimBuster	8366	We passed 100,000 police, the assault weapons ban, the Brady Bill.	1
ClaimBuster	8367	I know my own view is I'd rather have a private plan.	0
ClaimBuster	8368	Well, we, the living Americans, have gone through four wars.	1
ClaimBuster	8369	We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag.	1
ClaimBuster	8370	Let me tell you a little what it's like to be president.	0
ClaimBuster	8371	Well, here we go again.	0
ClaimBuster	8372	And we're now in a position where we can transition out, because there's no reason why Americans should die when Afghans are perfectly capable of defending their own country.	1
ClaimBuster	8373	I have a little foundation for the disabled called the Dole Foundation.	1
ClaimBuster	8374	In Longview, Texas the other day, I met a woman who was almost in tears because she had been able to keep her job while spending time with her husband who had cancer.	1
ClaimBuster	8375	He talks about economic growth as a great indicator of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	8376	And you can't convert from potato chips to airplanes in an emergency.	0
ClaimBuster	8377	Now, you don't do that.	0
ClaimBuster	8378	What happens in those forests, because of lousy federal policy, is they grow to be -- they are not -- they're not harvested.	1
ClaimBuster	8379	It's putting a hair-trigger on nuclear war.	0
ClaimBuster	8380	I didn't hear any plan to fix Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	8381	I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years.	1
ClaimBuster	8382	Can we become a breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world?	0
ClaimBuster	8383	But suppose we came up with that?	0
ClaimBuster	8384	Whether or not our forces were of high morale and high standing and well-equipped.	0
ClaimBuster	8385	But I'm most concerned about the whole problem of the spread of atomic weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	8386	I'm sure there are hundreds of others.	0
ClaimBuster	8387	But it's because I see this -- we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth.	0
ClaimBuster	8388	We're talking about six percentage points over six years, and with that money you give it back to the working people.	1
ClaimBuster	8389	Boy, great question and important question, because you're absolutely right.	0
ClaimBuster	8390	You know, in the last, or two decades ago, it was routine for leaders of foreign countries to come over here and say you guys have got to do something about these horrendous deficits because it's causing tremendous problems for the rest of the world, and we were lectured to all the time.	1
ClaimBuster	8391	Strong relations in Europe is in our nation's interest.	0
ClaimBuster	8392	And what they want is the ability to just focus on some really big challenges that we face right now, and that's what I have been trying to focus on this entire campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	8393	But there are always going to be elements in these countries that potentially threaten the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	8394	Now, either he's going to break all these wonderful promises he's told you about or he's going to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	8395	And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can't bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so bad.	1
ClaimBuster	8396	"It would be the highest honor for me to have your support on November second and for you to say, ""Jerry Ford, you've done a good job, keep on doing it."""	0
ClaimBuster	8397	But now we've got a very good concept called competitive strategies.	0
ClaimBuster	8398	Kids go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war.	0
ClaimBuster	8399	First time they've ever endorsed a candidate.	1
ClaimBuster	8400	I don't think it provides effective governmental controls.	0
ClaimBuster	8401	Because we are first in the world in space, as I've indicated; we are first in science; we are first in education, and we're going to move even further ahead with the kind of leadership that we can provide in these years ahead.	1
ClaimBuster	8402	But I'll tell you something, I'm proud that people who are 30 years old and 40 years old now have someone in their generation that is going to be vice president of the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	8403	You've been all over the country repeating something that, I will admit, the press has also been repeating -- that I believed that nuclear missiles could be fired and then called back.	1
ClaimBuster	8404	A shameless plug there, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	8405	I did to because I too hope that we'll discover cures from the stem cells and from the research derived.	0
ClaimBuster	8406	When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax.	1
ClaimBuster	8407	But I think anybody who wears a uniform is a great American.	0
ClaimBuster	8408	Somebody who would come to me if somebody came up with a crazy idea that we ought to trade arms to the Ayatollah for hostages and say, Ã¢â€°Â¥Mr.	0
ClaimBuster	8409	Let's do a lot of things to impose efficiencies.	0
ClaimBuster	8410	What I do think should be done, once they are safely here with their families, and that tragedy is over - we've endured this humiliation for just lacking one week of a year now - then, I think, it is time for us to have a complete investigation as to the diplomatic efforts that were made in the beginning, why they have been there so long, and when they came home, what did we have to do in order to bring that about - what arrangements were made?	0
ClaimBuster	8411	And I hear from my farmers and friends all the time.	1
ClaimBuster	8412	I think if you're going to have tax relief, everybody ought to get it.	0
ClaimBuster	8413	I think you know better.	0
ClaimBuster	8414	Where did you find this?	0
ClaimBuster	8415	Why should they be rifling through your files?	0
ClaimBuster	8416	The trial lawyers, big supporters of the president.	1
ClaimBuster	8417	But if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn't be so bad.	0
ClaimBuster	8418	I wanted to hitchhike a ride home in his tank with him.	0
ClaimBuster	8419	I think we ought to restore the three-day waiting period under the Brady Law.	0
ClaimBuster	8420	Millions and millions of people at work.	1
ClaimBuster	8421	A lot of questions are first impression, and these questions that have been seen many times come up in a new context and so -- but, you know, this is a very important issue.	0
ClaimBuster	8422	Let's have community health centers.	0
ClaimBuster	8423	So the net tax increase in his plan's somewhere between 60 and 80 billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	8424	Maybe we can work it out.	0
ClaimBuster	8425	I would support an effort to ban corporate soft money and labor union soft money so long as there was dues check-off.	0
ClaimBuster	8426	You should have changed the law.	0
ClaimBuster	8427	It's not my term, it's the president's own secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating.	1
ClaimBuster	8428	In addition to that, the money that I raise from upper-income people and from asking foreign corporations just to pay the same income on their income earned in America that American corporations do will be used to give incentives back to upper-income people.	0
ClaimBuster	8429	Let me help the governor.	0
ClaimBuster	8430	public reports not long ago about ships that could not leave American ports because of a lack of crews.	1
ClaimBuster	8431	"Windows smashed out, painted on one of them ""Unkept promises;"" on another, ""Despair."""	1
ClaimBuster	8432	To get the interest rates down.	0
ClaimBuster	8433	Number three, the Vice President - on May fifteenth after the U-2 flight - indicated that the flights were going on, even though the Administration and the President had canceled the flights on May twelfth.	1
ClaimBuster	8434	Of course, and that again -- no, I think that that was ill-considered.	0
ClaimBuster	8435	That's-at least that's what I read.	0
ClaimBuster	8436	If I'm interested in figuring out my foreign policy, I associate myself with my running mate, Joe Biden or with Dick Lugar, the Republican ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, or General Jim Jones, the former supreme allied commander of NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	8437	We wish you a lot of luck.	0
ClaimBuster	8438	They just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days: $43 billion of giveaways, including favors to the oil and gas industry and the people importing ceiling fans from China.	1
ClaimBuster	8439	It's a nation that's not like -- like others and it does not have a civilian leadership that is calling the shots there.	1
ClaimBuster	8440	You know, like hair transplants, I might need one of those myself.	0
ClaimBuster	8441	That's a test of prestige.	0
ClaimBuster	8442	I'd say, several hundred of them.	1
ClaimBuster	8443	In 1957 I was in Havana.	1
ClaimBuster	8444	Senator Obama has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	8445	And I believe that's very, very important.	0
ClaimBuster	8446	One party is ready to move in these programs.	0
ClaimBuster	8447	As the result in the last uh - two years uh - we have had a responsible monetary policy.	0
ClaimBuster	8448	I'm going to stand up and fight for the American worker.	0
ClaimBuster	8449	I costed out the cost of the Democratic platform.	0
ClaimBuster	8450	China had a space launch and a space walk.	1
ClaimBuster	8451	President Clinton ran for governor in 1990 and said he's going to fill out his term, but he didn't.	1
ClaimBuster	8452	All right, I'm not going to cut education funding.	0
ClaimBuster	8453	Otherwise, with a steady rate of economic growth - and Mr. Nixon and Mr. Rockefeller, in their meeting, said a five per cent economic growth would bring by 1962 ten billion dollars extra in tax revenues.	1
ClaimBuster	8454	And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you.	0
ClaimBuster	8455	But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program.	0
ClaimBuster	8456	And -- and they're throughout many nations in the Middle East.	1
ClaimBuster	8457	It has - uh left out some that I have recommended, unfortunately.	1
ClaimBuster	8458	Well I welcome this opportunity to join Senator Kennedy completely on that statement and to say before this largest television audience in history something that I have been saying in the past and want to - will always say in the future.	1
ClaimBuster	8459	So I want to keep the quality of health care.	0
ClaimBuster	8460	It's kind of one of those exaggerations.	0
ClaimBuster	8461	You said that they could get it in the private marketplace.	1
ClaimBuster	8462	But let's get back to the core issue here.	0
ClaimBuster	8463	We got great faith in the ability of liberty to transform societies, to convert a hostile world to a peaceful world.	0
ClaimBuster	8464	And that amendment put the Senate of the United States on record with a majority of the Senator's own party voting for it, as well as the majority of Republicans - put them on record - against the very position that the Senator takes now of surrendering, of indicating in advance, that the United States will not defend the offshore islands.	1
ClaimBuster	8465	We'll continue to try to get things that we didn't get in a program that has already brought the rate of spending of government down from 17 percent to 6.1 percent, a program of returning authority and autonomy to the local and State governments that has been unjustly seized by the Federal Government.	1
ClaimBuster	8466	As a matter of fact, we have a vast range of technology and weaponry right now that provides all the bargaining chips that we need.	0
ClaimBuster	8467	But that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.	0
ClaimBuster	8468	I talk to Tony Blair all the time.	1
ClaimBuster	8469	You've got some pretty strong-willed guys up there that argue with you.	0
ClaimBuster	8470	And that tax, there are no deductions, so a person making anywhere from 10, 15, 20 -- they're paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money.	1
ClaimBuster	8471	Mr. Ayers is not involved in my campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	8472	He, himself, has said, and rightly so, that he'll be a strong Vice President.	1
ClaimBuster	8473	In the election of 1960, and with the world around us, the question is whether the world will exist half-slave or half-free, whether it will move in the direction of freedom, in the direction of the road that we are taking, or whether it will move in the direction of slavery.	0
ClaimBuster	8474	The fact that you have an agreement is one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	8475	At least we have low interest rates that the Fed can control.	0
ClaimBuster	8476	Republicans have cut 53 billion dollars in spending, that's why the budget looked good.	1
ClaimBuster	8477	It's the sunrise side, not the sunset side.	0
ClaimBuster	8478	I know it's not popular, and I understand the nature of your question.	0
ClaimBuster	8479	It hasn't been undone since I was there.	1
ClaimBuster	8480	But I think there are personal differences.	0
ClaimBuster	8481	I think the governor's instinct is not necessarily bad because we have worked with the Russians in a constructive way in Kosovo, for example, to end the conflict there.	0
ClaimBuster	8482	I do not add a penny to the national debt.	1
ClaimBuster	8483	I'd like to just respond, if I might.	0
ClaimBuster	8484	He supported it at the National Governors Conference and I supported it in breaking a tie in a major compromise package and we got assailed by the Democrats in the election over that.	1
ClaimBuster	8485	So that's one of the things that I think makes a big difference between us.	0
ClaimBuster	8486	And this was a -- this was a program of the government.	1
ClaimBuster	8487	Surely we can find common ground to reduce the number of abortions in America.	0
ClaimBuster	8488	We've seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter.	1
ClaimBuster	8489	I think that we have observed, ourselves, and have done our best to see that human rights are extended throughout the world.	0
ClaimBuster	8490	I supported it because ethnic cleansing and genocide was taking place there.	1
ClaimBuster	8491	That's what he's done when it comes to economic policies that will help working families get a leg up.	1
ClaimBuster	8492	My concerns about the senator is that, in the course of this campaign, I've been listening very carefully to what he says, and he changes positions on the war in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	8493	You said you'd cut the deficit in half.	1
ClaimBuster	8494	The question was about the Supreme Court.	1
ClaimBuster	8495	They're not going to follow somebody who says this is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time.	0
ClaimBuster	8496	In every one of these instances, the Ford administration has failed, and I hope tonight that I and Mr. Ford will have a chance to discuss the reasons for those failures.	0
ClaimBuster	8497	And manufacturers here in the U.S. making the same products can't compete.	1
ClaimBuster	8498	That the best is over.	0
ClaimBuster	8499	Some of that money ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.	1
ClaimBuster	8500	And he said at that time, in a quote, and this is a paraphrase, a freeze, that's easy.	1
ClaimBuster	8501	Why did we suddenly offer Congo three hundred students last June when they had the tremendous revolt?	0
ClaimBuster	8502	You're going to have plans...	0
ClaimBuster	8503	We've got potentially 600,000 jobs and 100 years worth of energy right beneath our feet with natural gas.	1
ClaimBuster	8504	That bill pays for these urban enterprise zones by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more.	1
ClaimBuster	8505	We've got to be tough on international terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	8506	They didn't do the planning.	0
ClaimBuster	8507	Wouldn't it be nice to be perfect?	0
ClaimBuster	8508	A lot of great single moms, single dads.	0
ClaimBuster	8509	We've also got to look to the future.	0
ClaimBuster	8510	That doesn't cost any more money.	0
ClaimBuster	8511	And I have devoted a major portion of this campaign to going across this country and looking for opportunities to go to white groups and African American groups and Latino groups and Asian American groups and say the same thing.	0
ClaimBuster	8512	The Chinese Communists expressed regrets to us over a plane incident in 1956.	1
ClaimBuster	8513	That legislation uh allegedly would help our unemployment, but uh - we all know that it would've controlled our economy, it would've added uh - ten to thirty billion dollars each year in additional expenditures by the Federal Government.	1
ClaimBuster	8514	Raise some more money, spend the money on tax incentives to have growth in the private sector, take the money from the defense cuts and reinvest it in new transportation and communications and environmental clean-up systems.	0
ClaimBuster	8515	We'll even give it to you.	0
ClaimBuster	8516	I think that the president has to be prepared to use the power of the nation when our vital interests are threatened, when our treaty commitments are at stake, when we know that something has to be done that is in the national interest, and that is a part of being president.	0
ClaimBuster	8517	Instead of a high unemployment, we have the lowest African-American and Latin American unemployment rates in history and 22 million new jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	8518	I believe there are certain principles we must find in dealing with him and his colleagues - principles, if followed, that will keep the peace and that also can extend freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	8519	Every place I go I talk about it, and I think they want it done.	0
ClaimBuster	8520	That little child needs to be loved and hugged and nurtured and made to feel special, like your children were.	0
ClaimBuster	8521	And the reason President Eisenhower's vetoes have been sustained - the reason the Congress does not send up bills to him which they think will be vetoed - is because the people and the Congress, the majority of them, know the country is behind the President.	0
ClaimBuster	8522	This is a body based in The Hague where unaccountable judges and prosecutors can pull our troops or diplomats up for trial.	1
ClaimBuster	8523	We've got to sit down together across the table.	0
ClaimBuster	8524	I worry about federalizing education if I were you.	0
ClaimBuster	8525	I felt that -- I wish we'd have had a better vision of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	8526	And their aggression in Georgia is not acceptable behavior.	0
ClaimBuster	8527	But for our children and our grandchildren, we need to have a different strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	8528	I remember one day on the floor I said now, gentlemen, let me tax your memories, and Kennedy jumped up and said, why haven't we thought of that before.	1
ClaimBuster	8529	I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida.	1
ClaimBuster	8530	Well, I think it's terrible.	0
ClaimBuster	8531	They both said they were Vietnam veterans supporting me because I had an economic program to put them back to work.	1
ClaimBuster	8532	Well, I think it's true that we shouldn't apply a strict litmus test and the most important thing in any judge is their capacity to provide fairness and justice to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	8533	A lot of us saw this train wreck coming.	0
ClaimBuster	8534	I can't tell you how lucky I am.	0
ClaimBuster	8535	He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.	1
ClaimBuster	8536	We've got to do more to get the whole economy moving, and that's what I believe I will be able to do.	0
ClaimBuster	8537	In other words, there are practical things we can do.	0
ClaimBuster	8538	Ten days before I took the oath of office as president they were 21 and a half percent.	1
ClaimBuster	8539	We've spent, so far, close to $700 billion and if we continue on the path that we're on, as Senator McCain is suggesting, it's going to go well over $1 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	8540	We've got to reduce the class size so that the student who walks in has more one-on-one time with the teacher.	0
ClaimBuster	8541	Yes, we have to succeed, and I have a better plan to help us do it.	0
ClaimBuster	8542	The people want economic reform.	0
ClaimBuster	8543	If we continue under Mr. Ford's policy by 1985 or '90 we'll have twenty nations that have the capability of exploding atomic weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	8544	Now that means recruiting new teachers for the public schools.	0
ClaimBuster	8545	One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code.	0
ClaimBuster	8546	Over time we have developed a government that comes at the people, that comes from the top down, where the people are more or less treated as objects to be programmed during the campaign with commercials and media events and fear messages and personal attacks and things of that nature.	0
ClaimBuster	8547	And because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, we've begun to fight our way back.	0
ClaimBuster	8548	Our allies - the smaller countries get trampled in the rush.	0
ClaimBuster	8549	It's not to increase the scope of the federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	8550	I think it is respecting life to do it in an ethical way.	0
ClaimBuster	8551	Not only do 98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000, but I also want to give them additional tax breaks, because they are the drivers of the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	8552	That's going to change when I'm president, but we can't change it unless we fundamentally change Senator McCain's and George Bush's foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	8553	One percent of America, the highest one percent of income earners in America, got $89 billion of tax cut last year.	1
ClaimBuster	8554	But I think it makes sense, I think most Americans in their guts know, that we ought to pass a sort of truth standard.	0
ClaimBuster	8555	We've been dealing with him; he's been dealing drugs to our kids.	1
ClaimBuster	8556	That's why most experts say that this tax scheme will blow a huge hole in the deficit, raise interest rates and weaken the economy and that will take away all the benefits of the tax cut with a weaker economy.	1
ClaimBuster	8557	And our challenge right now is the Iranians continue on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons, and it's a great threat.	1
ClaimBuster	8558	And I don't want historians, ten years from now, to say, these were the years when the tide ran out for the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	8559	We are all in this together.	0
ClaimBuster	8560	But when we look at the growth of G.N.P.	0
ClaimBuster	8561	She's been doing this for 30 years.	1
ClaimBuster	8562	I think I'm a much wiser and more experienced man than I was when I debated four years ago against President Ford.	0
ClaimBuster	8563	And I believe that in cases of India and Africa and Latin America that this is where our emphasis should be.	0
ClaimBuster	8564	This brings up the whole question of what Presidential leadership is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	8565	See, the subjective thing is when does President Bush react?	0
ClaimBuster	8566	We expressed regrets for a flight over Eastern Germany under this Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	8567	And we won the nomination by going out into the streets - barbershops, beauty parlors, restaurants, stores, in factory shift lines also in farmers' markets and livestock sale barns - and we talked a lot and we listened a lot and we learned from the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	8568	They want to get into our market.	1
ClaimBuster	8569	I have one difference with Mr. Perot on that because I don't think we need to touch Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	8570	I want to build more pipelines to move natural gas throughout this hemisphere.	0
ClaimBuster	8571	The one in the field of health is worth mentioning.	0
ClaimBuster	8572	I wanted us to pay for it, since we're at war.	0
ClaimBuster	8573	If we didn't have a depletion allowance of certainly, I believe, the present amount, we would have our oil exploration cut substantially in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	8574	We're going to block grant into Medicaid into the states...	0
ClaimBuster	8575	It's very important to us that this be done with the full involvement of minority citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	8576	I think the American people will draw their own conclusions.	0
ClaimBuster	8577	Now, let me say that there was a time a few years ago when the United States Senate was about to blow up.	1
ClaimBuster	8578	No, Cuba is not lost, and I don't think this kind of defeatist talk by Senator Kennedy helps the situation one bit.	0
ClaimBuster	8579	And I think we can do that.	0
ClaimBuster	8580	I went to New York.	1
ClaimBuster	8581	And yet even though Ambassador Smith and Ambassador Gardner, both Republican Ambassadors, both warned of Castro, the Marxist influences around Castro, the Communist influences around Castro, both of them have testified in the last six weeks, that in spite of their warnings to the American government, nothing was done.	1
ClaimBuster	8582	But I want to get our private sector growing and I know how to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	8583	Look, this, in my view, is the highest responsibility of the President of the United States, which is to maintain the safety of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	8584	And the plans that I talked about will create even more.	0
ClaimBuster	8585	My record on world affairs is pretty well known because I've been president for 4 years, so I feel I've been talking issues.	1
ClaimBuster	8586	And the only criterion I ever put forward in my own mind was who among the several million people in this country would be the best person qualified to be president, if something should happen to me and to join me in being vice president if I should serve out my term.	0
ClaimBuster	8587	And it is important that we don't provide veto power to the United Nations or anyone else in acting in our interests.	0
ClaimBuster	8588	There's no doubt, I think, about that.	0
ClaimBuster	8589	We get nothing for it.	0
ClaimBuster	8590	It is certainly small-business people and others, and they understand that responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	8591	They're just barely enough to pay for my food and pay for an apartment.	1
ClaimBuster	8592	I don't believe the present administration has done that.	0
ClaimBuster	8593	They're looking to us for leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	8594	Secondly, I think one thing that if I were sent to do the job, I would sit down with FDA, look at exactly where we are.	0
ClaimBuster	8595	But I also know how to lead those alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	8596	Right now, you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas.	1
ClaimBuster	8597	The fact is that we now have people from the Middle East, allegedly, coming across the border.	1
ClaimBuster	8598	But I salute him for his passion.	0
ClaimBuster	8599	I would like to unite this country to get an agenda done that will speak to the hopes and aspirations of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	8600	But at least it took that burden away from them.	0
ClaimBuster	8601	I think we're going to have to do better.	0
ClaimBuster	8602	And so I don't support censorship.	0
ClaimBuster	8603	We have made remarkable success.	0
ClaimBuster	8604	A war that I was in, where we had an Army, that it wasn't through any fault of their own, but they were defeated.	1
ClaimBuster	8605	Well, as a matter of fact there is.	0
ClaimBuster	8606	This is a government that thinks a 2% rate of return on your money is satisfactory.	0
ClaimBuster	8607	So, I have never seriously warned and said we must plan according to Armageddon.	1
ClaimBuster	8608	He served this nation with great, great skill and courage and bravery for thirty-five years.	1
ClaimBuster	8609	We held to account a terrorist regime in Saddam Hussein.	0
ClaimBuster	8610	I support it; the president opposes it.	0
ClaimBuster	8611	What we do have right now is a setting where I'd like to bring money from overseas back to this country.	0
ClaimBuster	8612	I am for reform in this area, for tough enforcement at the border, and for many other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, but all my life I've fought for a fair nation.	0
ClaimBuster	8613	Because it was an opportunity for us to demonstrate what we were looking for in a running mate.	0
ClaimBuster	8614	And right now, Osama bin Laden might be in jail or dead.	0
ClaimBuster	8615	Thank the people of Hartford, the Commission, and all those out here who may be listening or watching.	0
ClaimBuster	8616	Just going to make a point.	0
ClaimBuster	8617	The fact is, that in today's oil wells, there is more oil still there than we have so far taken out and used.	1
ClaimBuster	8618	That's my difference with the President.	0
ClaimBuster	8619	Now, private schools play a great role in our society.	0
ClaimBuster	8620	I think Mr. Perot has confronted this deficit issue, but I think it's important to point out that we really have 2 deficits in America, not one.	1
ClaimBuster	8621	He was trying to get rid of sanctions for a reason: He wanted to restart his weapons programs.	1
ClaimBuster	8622	We simply are going to provide a deterrent so that it will be too costly for them if they are nursing any ideas of aggression against us.	0
ClaimBuster	8623	A child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they can't do it because it's school property.	0
ClaimBuster	8624	I will pick judges who will interpret the Constitution, but I'll have no litmus test.	0
ClaimBuster	8625	I'll remind mothers and dads the best weapon is the off/on button, and paying attention to your children, and eating dinner with them and being -- I'm sorry.	0
ClaimBuster	8626	Almost every step of the way, our troops have been left on these extraordinarily difficult missions.	0
ClaimBuster	8627	And I think that anyone that's seeking this position, as well as other people, probably, have thought to themselves, what about this, what about that?	0
ClaimBuster	8628	What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help.	0
ClaimBuster	8629	And I would also point out that Senator Kennedy left out a part of the cost of that program - a twenty-five percent rise in food prices that the people would have to pay.	1
ClaimBuster	8630	The next president of the United States is going to have to decide how we leave, when we leave, and what we leave behind.	0
ClaimBuster	8631	This current campaign financing system has not reflected credit on anybody in either party.	1
ClaimBuster	8632	They would not be in the budget, but you want one now?	0
ClaimBuster	8633	And it isn't a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal problem.	0
ClaimBuster	8634	I visited some of those kids with no limbs today, because they didn't have the armor on those vehicles.	1
ClaimBuster	8635	You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don't believe that Hillary has the stamina.	0
ClaimBuster	8636	I made a mistake in the way I talk about it.	1
ClaimBuster	8637	Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids.	1
ClaimBuster	8638	I think we should stiffen the embargo on the Belgrade government, and I think we have to consider whether or not we should lift the arms embargo now on the Bosnians, since they are in no way in a fair fight with a heavily armed opponent bent on ethnic cleansing.	1
ClaimBuster	8639	Senator McCain likes to talk about earmarks a lot.	1
ClaimBuster	8640	The members of Congress, Arthur Vandenberg, Walter George, were part of the process, and before our nation made a secret agreement, or before we made a bluffing statement, we were sure that we had the backing not only of the president and the secretary of state, but also of the Congress and the people.	1
ClaimBuster	8641	So it's not that we always disagree.	0
ClaimBuster	8642	That shows a lack of understanding.	0
ClaimBuster	8643	Because in this critical year - period of the sixties we've got to move forward, all Americans must move forward together, and we have to get the greatest cooperation possible between labor and management.	0
ClaimBuster	8644	And Governor Romney wants to take us back to those policies, a foreign policy that's wrong and reckless, economic policies that won't create jobs, won't reduce our deficit, but will make sure that folks at the very top don't have to play by the same rules that you do.	0
ClaimBuster	8645	Everybody -- every economist, every businessman -- believes that.	0
ClaimBuster	8646	Taxes are going up when you run up the top two brackets.	1
ClaimBuster	8647	Let's look at the situation with regard to economic growth as it really is.	0
ClaimBuster	8648	Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	8649	And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork-barrel spending projects.	1
ClaimBuster	8650	And important topic, and one which I learned a great deal about, particularly as I was serving as governor of my state, because I had the chance to pull together a cabinet and all the applicants seemed to be men.	1
ClaimBuster	8651	It's in this way, by making wise choices, that we're stronger, we enhance the chances of arms control.	0
ClaimBuster	8652	It's one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had.	0
ClaimBuster	8653	I don't want the federal government making decisions for consumers or for providers.	0
ClaimBuster	8654	That in itself is a big difference.	0
ClaimBuster	8655	But I'm not going to make decisions that I think are wrong for America.	0
ClaimBuster	8656	And the -- the challenge we have -- I know you haven't been in a position to actually execute foreign policy -- but every time you've offered an opinion, you've been wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	8657	"Unless the president speaks, then of course uh - the country doesn't speak, and Franklin Roosevelt said: ""The pre - uh - the presidency of the United States is above all a place of moral leadership."""	1
ClaimBuster	8658	And we have a responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	8659	Now, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws.	1
ClaimBuster	8660	He appointed three people, I appointed three people to get campaign finance reform.	1
ClaimBuster	8661	I would like to tell you a quick story.	0
ClaimBuster	8662	And the reason they do is because they do some smart things.	0
ClaimBuster	8663	And I read in the bulletin about teenage pregnancies, about the difficulties that families are having to make ends meet.	0
ClaimBuster	8664	I thought it was interesting that on the two minutes he spent about a million-and-a-half on my plan, which means he doesn't want you to know what he's doing is loading up IOUs for future generations.	1
ClaimBuster	8665	And there are a long list of thing.	0
ClaimBuster	8666	And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others.	1
ClaimBuster	8667	And we're going to keep on doing that.	0
ClaimBuster	8668	The Senator mentioned the trial lawyers.	1
ClaimBuster	8669	There were eleven dictators when we came into power in 1953 in Latin America.	1
ClaimBuster	8670	And that is when their jobs come up from a dollar an hour to $6 an hour, and ours go down to $6 an hour; then it's leveled again, but in the meantime you've wrecked the country with these kind of deals.	1
ClaimBuster	8671	I can only point out that if we are going to judge the Administrations in terms of our attitude toward dictators, we're glad to have a comparison with the previous administration.	0
ClaimBuster	8672	We had navy vessels that couldn't leave harbor because of lack of crew or, again, lack of spare parts.	1
ClaimBuster	8673	I know Senator Kennedy sees them, too.	1
ClaimBuster	8674	It's invest and grow, put our people first, control health care costs and provide basic health care to all Americans, have an education system 2nd to none and revitalize the private economy.	0
ClaimBuster	8675	I'm also against the pipeline embargo, which you folks attempted to impose.	1
ClaimBuster	8676	There is one issue that stands out above all the rest, one in which every American is concerned, regardless of what group he may be a member and regardless of where he may live.	0
ClaimBuster	8677	I served for eight years in the House of Representatives and I served on the Intelligence Committee, specialized in looking at arms control.	1
ClaimBuster	8678	That's got to be paid by our children and grandchildren, too, if we don't do it.	0
ClaimBuster	8679	Let's just make that very clear.	0
ClaimBuster	8680	We haven't adequately funded veterans' care.	1
ClaimBuster	8681	Uhh - and I think uh - we've tightened it up; we've uh - straightened out their problems that developed over the last few years.	0
ClaimBuster	8682	Whenever you do that, inevitably the dictator is encouraged to try it again.	0
ClaimBuster	8683	And we ought not to crowd these people ahead of them in line.	0
ClaimBuster	8684	I think that's an important part of leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	8685	Certainly we care about the people, we care about the children, we care about the tragedy.	0
ClaimBuster	8686	Remember, he's the person who's accusing me of not acting multilaterally.	1
ClaimBuster	8687	But I think that we also have to have a sense of mission in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	8688	I don't have time in 30 seconds to respond to fix all that.	0
ClaimBuster	8689	Bringing down our deficit by adding $7 trillion of tax cuts and military spending that our military is not asking for, before we even get to the debt that we currently have, that is not going to make us more competitive.	1
ClaimBuster	8690	We tried this with Hitler.	1
ClaimBuster	8691	It immediately was put to use.	1
ClaimBuster	8692	My own background is different from his.	1
ClaimBuster	8693	And in most cases, that failure to meet the test was because of a lack of manning requirements, an inability to fill many of the slots in those divisions.	1
ClaimBuster	8694	Only a few percent of small businesses make more than $250,000 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	8695	I want to finally get something done on Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	8696	But the price of coal is down worldwide.	1
ClaimBuster	8697	I'm in public service because I love this country.	1
ClaimBuster	8698	I served as a pastor in my congregation for about 10 years.	1
ClaimBuster	8699	What we do need to do, though, is control the growth of these mandatory programs.	0
ClaimBuster	8700	I believe instead of doing that, we should concentrate our aid in long-term loans which these people can pay back either in hard money or in local currency.	0
ClaimBuster	8701	That's not the way we're going to create jobs here.	0
ClaimBuster	8702	We also wanna revert back to the stature and the respect that our country had in previous administrations.	0
ClaimBuster	8703	Some of these other countries, particularly in the developing world, their pollution is much worse than anywhere else and their people want higher standards of living.	1
ClaimBuster	8704	I know there are all kinds of circumstances and explanations.	0
ClaimBuster	8705	She's going to get rid of nobody.	0
ClaimBuster	8706	Why can't they do it quietly?	0
ClaimBuster	8707	Now, the Vice President will probably tell you that it's going to take an army of IRS collectors again.	0
ClaimBuster	8708	I am proud of what we did at the Democratic Convention, putting 2 HIV-positive people on the platform, and I am proud of the leadership that I'm going to bring to this country in dealing with the AIDS crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	8709	And what we've said is let's change those certifications.	0
ClaimBuster	8710	I don't think there are any villains, but, boy, is the system rotten.	0
ClaimBuster	8711	And therefore, I think you ought to consider doing something about it, and voting for an Independent in 1980.	0
ClaimBuster	8712	"I was in Pennsylvania with someone who had just graduated -- this was in Philadelphia -- and she said, ""I've got my degree."	1
ClaimBuster	8713	But frankly, I don't think that's the problem today.	0
ClaimBuster	8714	She should not be allowed to run.	0
ClaimBuster	8715	And so the fundamental answer to your question, who can lead and who's shown the ability to get things done?	0
ClaimBuster	8716	It's the largest increase in federal government health care ever.	1
ClaimBuster	8717	My campaign chairman, Secretary Jim Baker's wife.	1
ClaimBuster	8718	We see in -- in Libya, an attack apparently by, I think we know now, by terrorists of some kind against -- against our people there, four people dead.	1
ClaimBuster	8719	I'm simply not going to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	8720	What I've said is I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of working Americans, 95 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	8721	But, when my figures are challenged, as the President himself challenged them after I made them, I think it should be called to the attention of John and the others here that my figures are the figures of the Department of Energy, which has not been overly optimistic in recent years as to how much supply we have left.	0
ClaimBuster	8722	Your premiums are going up.	1
ClaimBuster	8723	He had to be subpoenaed.	0
ClaimBuster	8724	My opponent says we didn't have any allies in this war.	1
ClaimBuster	8725	And that's how best it is to keep the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	8726	I was disappointed in the ruling because I think abortions ought to be more rare in America, and I'm worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions.	0
ClaimBuster	8727	He chose a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans over getting that equipment out into the homeland as fast as possible.	1
ClaimBuster	8728	So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times.	1
ClaimBuster	8729	Well, I want to thank Senator McCain and Bob for moderating.	0
ClaimBuster	8730	Marijuana use is up 141percent.	1
ClaimBuster	8731	We need to be smarter about now we wage a war on terror.	0
ClaimBuster	8732	My opponent was against it.	1
ClaimBuster	8733	I am -- I have a proposal for a tax cut for all people earning less than the $200,000.	0
ClaimBuster	8734	So -- so the question, I think, that we've got to ask ourselves is, yes, we've got to solve this problem short term.	0
ClaimBuster	8735	They were already having a tough time because of high gas prices.	1
ClaimBuster	8736	And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn't say it.	1
ClaimBuster	8737	We've seen uh - in the past the destruction of elected governments, like in Chile, and the strong support of military dictatorship there.	1
ClaimBuster	8738	We paid down the debt for two years.	1
ClaimBuster	8739	But I'm concerned that that will get overturned.	0
ClaimBuster	8740	We don't have modernization now.	1
ClaimBuster	8741	As I said a couple of months ago, I stand here as my own man and I want you to see me for who I really am.	0
ClaimBuster	8742	Senator Obama opposes both storing and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.	1
ClaimBuster	8743	Secondly, I didn't say we had the worst slums in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	8744	We have had less man-hours lost by strikes in these last seven years than we had in the previous seven years, by a great deal.	1
ClaimBuster	8745	Even the administration has admitted they haven't done the training, because they came back to Congress a few weeks ago and asked for a complete reprogramming of the money.	1
ClaimBuster	8746	I think that some common sense gun safety measures are certainly needed with the flood of cheap handguns that have sometimes been working their way into the hands of the wrong people.	0
ClaimBuster	8747	There's some 600-plus tons of unsecured material still in the former Soviet Union and Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	8748	I'll have an administration that will make you proud.	0
ClaimBuster	8749	It's the single most important public health crisis, single most important public health emergency we've had in our lifetimes and I think there are a number of things we have to do including supporting legislation which is now moving through the Congress, which will commit this nation to the resources to find a cure which will provide broad education and prevention, which will provide sensitive and caring treatment for the victims of AIDS.	1
ClaimBuster	8750	Because I went to Washington to fix problems.	1
ClaimBuster	8751	This isn't the kind of Administration we need.	0
ClaimBuster	8752	I believe that -- and when I became Governor of California, I started this, and I continue it in this office -- that any issue that comes before me, I have instructed Cabinet members and staff they are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue.	0
ClaimBuster	8753	And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the world's oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.	1
ClaimBuster	8754	We need all the talent we can get.	0
ClaimBuster	8755	Incidentally, I know the value of making sure our troops have the latest technology.	0
ClaimBuster	8756	And that means tax cuts for the middle-class.	0
ClaimBuster	8757	In our first debate he proposed America pass a global test.	1
ClaimBuster	8758	Give our farm families a decent income with spending $20to $25 billion a year on farm subsidies, and I'm sure we can do that.	0
ClaimBuster	8759	And the president just walks on by this problem.	0
ClaimBuster	8760	I want our legal system to work better.	0
ClaimBuster	8761	That's why I think it's important.	0
ClaimBuster	8762	What you're interested in is trying to figure out, how is this going to impact you?	0
ClaimBuster	8763	I also thought the wealthiest people in America ought to pay for it, ladies and gentlemen.	0
ClaimBuster	8764	In addition, uh - the Department of Justice is fully enforcing, and enforcing effectively, the Voting Rights Act, the legislation that involves jobs, housing for minorities, not only blacks but all others.	1
ClaimBuster	8765	And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies.	0
ClaimBuster	8766	It's stuck in the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	8767	Should I be fortunate enough to earn your confidence, the mission of the United States military will be to be prepared and ready to fight and win war.	0
ClaimBuster	8768	But the point is that -- you see, I hear this all the time.	0
ClaimBuster	8769	Let me just mention three things very quickly.	0
ClaimBuster	8770	The way to make sure that we succeed is to send consistent, sound messages to the Iraqi people that when we give our word, we will keep our word, that we stand with you, that we believe you want to be free.	0
ClaimBuster	8771	I was a school board member, and a library board member.	1
ClaimBuster	8772	Actually, in constant dollars, in the domestic side of the budget, there has been no spending increase in the 4 years that we have been here.	1
ClaimBuster	8773	One reason people are skeptical is because people don't answer the questions they've been asked.	0
ClaimBuster	8774	And so now we've got to take some decisive action.	0
ClaimBuster	8775	You're not going to worry about it anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	8776	The fact is, we haven't done what we need to do to toughen up our borders, and I will.	0
ClaimBuster	8777	We'll start working on Day 1 in the Dole- Kemp administration.	0
ClaimBuster	8778	The top 5 percent of taxpayers will continue to pay 60 percent of the income tax the nation collects.	1
ClaimBuster	8779	The president said he would.	1
ClaimBuster	8780	I'm asking you to see me for who I really am.	0
ClaimBuster	8781	And we have been the safety valve, whether we wanted to or not, with the illegal entry here, in Mexico, where their population is increasing and they don't have an economy that can absorb them and provide the jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	8782	So point one, at the highest priority we must get a bill for depressed areas through the next Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	8783	And that's why people are so concerned.	0
ClaimBuster	8784	And if John wants to disagree with this, he can let me know, that, if the United States has Al Qaida, bin Laden, top-level lieutenants in our sights, and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out.	0
ClaimBuster	8785	I believe we're overextended in too many places.	0
ClaimBuster	8786	We had an $800 billion deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	8787	You've got people doing two and three rotations.	1
ClaimBuster	8788	Number four, we do have to develop their economic -- their economic capabilities.	0
ClaimBuster	8789	I really don't think your rights are being watered down.	0
ClaimBuster	8790	So I don't think we can judge on, the stock market has been strong.	0
ClaimBuster	8791	And nobody will be excluded for pre-existing conditions, which is a huge problem.	0
ClaimBuster	8792	When uh - the Vice President quotes me in January, sixty, I do not believe the federal government should pay directly teachers' salaries, but that was not the issue before the Senate in February.	1
ClaimBuster	8793	I want them to say these were the years when the tide came in; these were the years when the United States started to move again.	0
ClaimBuster	8794	Now, what do we do about it?	0
ClaimBuster	8795	But because of our leadership, because we didn't listen to the freeze -- the nuclear-freeze group, do you remember -- freeze it, back in the late 70s -- freeze, don't touch it; we're going to lock it in now or else we'll have war.	0
ClaimBuster	8796	I think when you measure and post results on the Internet or in the town newspapers, most parents say wait a minute, my child's school isn't doing what I want it to do and, therefore, become involved in education.	0
ClaimBuster	8797	It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.	0
ClaimBuster	8798	It finally gets to 50 cents at the end of the 5th year.	1
ClaimBuster	8799	The Democratic platform and others say five per cent.	1
ClaimBuster	8800	And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.	0
ClaimBuster	8801	And so I don't think our troops ought to be used for what's called nation-building.	0
ClaimBuster	8802	I'm looking at our economic plan because I'm concerned about the future for young people.	0
ClaimBuster	8803	But by doing all the others' favors, she's doing me favors.	0
ClaimBuster	8804	The last thing we want to do is commit more forces anywhere.	0
ClaimBuster	8805	And we both want to cut taxes, the difference is who we want to cut taxes for.	1
ClaimBuster	8806	I offer a new approach.	0
ClaimBuster	8807	Let me say first of all to you that I believe so strongly in the question you asked that I suggested this format tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	8808	Again and again and again, in the middle of the night, at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, my government has called me to take extraordinary steps for Americans in distress, and again and again and again I have responded.	1
ClaimBuster	8809	You know, I've heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years.	0
ClaimBuster	8810	They're going to expand their companies.	0
ClaimBuster	8811	I've said it's going to take some work.	1
ClaimBuster	8812	I wish that, looking back at the beginning of the president's term and even further back than that, that we'd have recognized that there was a growing energy and passion for freedom in that part of the world, and that we would have worked more aggressively with our friend and with other friends in the region to have them make the transition towards a more representative form of government, such that it didn't explode in the way that it did.	0
ClaimBuster	8813	Next Tuesday all of you will go to the polls, will stand there in the polling place and make a decision.	0
ClaimBuster	8814	But we certainly cannot have it in a presidential campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	8815	But it's good that we have them.	0
ClaimBuster	8816	But he wants to raise taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	8817	But my background, my experience, my knowledge of the people of this country, my commitment to our principles that don't change - those are the best bases to correct the horrible mistakes of this administration and restore our own country to a position of leadership in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	8818	It's very hard to get into the Japan market, as everybody knows.	0
ClaimBuster	8819	Now, Governor Reagan is running on a platform that calls for a Constitutional amendment banning abortion.	1
ClaimBuster	8820	The Vice President talks about national security.	1
ClaimBuster	8821	Katherine, I just want to point out that when Governor Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it?	1
ClaimBuster	8822	I would say that ships that carry Iranian oil, can't come into our ports.	0
ClaimBuster	8823	And secondly, only a liberal senator from Massachusetts would say that a 49 percent increase in funding for education was not enough.	1
ClaimBuster	8824	This president just -- I don't know if he sees what's really happened over there.	0
ClaimBuster	8825	And actually, you said it back in 2010.	1
ClaimBuster	8826	What he's proposing after over a trillion in new debt which has been added in the Federal debt in the course of the past eight years, an IOU our children and grandchildren will be paying for years, is a tax cut for the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country, an average of about $30,000 that we're going to give to people making $200,000 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	8827	Because she takes a tremendous amount of money.	1
ClaimBuster	8828	But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	8829	It is America that's in the lead in helping with humanitarian relief for Somalia.	1
ClaimBuster	8830	Well, let me say, first of all, I'd be happy to have a commission deal with this and I appreciate what Senator Dole did on the '83 Social Security commission.	0
ClaimBuster	8831	Russia does continue to battle us in the U.N. time and time again.	1
ClaimBuster	8832	I am for clean water.	0
ClaimBuster	8833	When you come to Washington to try to - as a governor - to try to begin a new program for your people, like uh the treatment of drug addicts, I found there were thirteen different federal agencies that I had to go to, to manage the uh drug treatment program.	1
ClaimBuster	8834	Let -- let -- let me say that we obviously would not wait for the United Nations Security Council.	0
ClaimBuster	8835	George Bush, who I think is one of the finest Vice Presidents this country has ever had -- George Bush and I have crisscrossed the country, and we've had, in these last few months, a wonderful experience.	1
ClaimBuster	8836	But once it exploded, I felt the same as the president did, which is these freedom voices and the streets of Egypt, where the people who were speaking of our principles and the President Mubarak had done things which were unimaginable and the idea of him crushing his people was not something that we could possibly support.	0
ClaimBuster	8837	He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.	0
ClaimBuster	8838	And I have proposed that.	1
ClaimBuster	8839	I said at the time that we had to hold the lid an federal spending, that for every dollar of a tax reduction we had to have an equal reduction in federal expenditures - a one-for-one proposition.	1
ClaimBuster	8840	That is what I want to do.	0
ClaimBuster	8841	But if we sit around blowing all this energy out the window on racial strife and hatred, we are stuck with a sure loser because we have been a melting pot.	0
ClaimBuster	8842	When a man and a women do the same amount of work, a man gets paid $1.00, a women only gets paid 59 cents.	1
ClaimBuster	8843	If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun.	0
ClaimBuster	8844	Mr. Mondale has recently announced a plan of his to get the democracies together and to work with the whole world to turn to democracy.	1
ClaimBuster	8845	That's how the United States began to prepare for its great actions in World War II and in the post-war period.	0
ClaimBuster	8846	President Lincoln opposed the war and there were people who said maybe he shouldn't be president, but I think he made us a pretty good president in wartime.	1
ClaimBuster	8847	I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.	1
ClaimBuster	8848	It came out of the committee of which I was the chairman - the labor subcommittee - in fifty-five.	1
ClaimBuster	8849	For example, as I have said, we have added some four million jobs in the last seventeen months.	1
ClaimBuster	8850	There's a lot of young folks saying, you know, why do I want to be involved with this mess?	0
ClaimBuster	8851	I think they noticed that as well.	0
ClaimBuster	8852	So, I think we are proving that we can go forward with conservation and benefit from that.	0
ClaimBuster	8853	Now, if you believe The Washington Post and you believe this extensive study that's been done -- and I'm reading it -- right after election day this year they're going to hit us with a hundred banks, it will be a $100-billion problem.	1
ClaimBuster	8854	But let me say this, because he spent millions and millions of dollars of advertising on the subject of Boston Harbor.	1
ClaimBuster	8855	We want to be sure it's fair and equitable.	0
ClaimBuster	8856	No, let me tell you something about that.	0
ClaimBuster	8857	This is a real important election.	0
ClaimBuster	8858	Mr. Putin now controls all the television stations.	1
ClaimBuster	8859	Sarah Palin knows about that better than most.	0
ClaimBuster	8860	I believe when we're strongest when we reach out and lead the world and build strong alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	8861	We should never forget that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have.	0
ClaimBuster	8862	It takes eight years, ten years, to do that.	1
ClaimBuster	8863	So to stand here and after eight years and say that you're going to lead on controlling spending and, you know, balancing our tax cuts so that they help middle class families when over the last eight years that hasn't happened I think just is, you know, kind of hard to swallow.	1
ClaimBuster	8864	We have a coal supply that is equal to 50% of the world's coal supply, good for centuries, in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	8865	Even though they had to find out they had 5,000 troops coming, they didn't even understand that.	0
ClaimBuster	8866	We've signed up over 110,000 children to the CHIPS program.	1
ClaimBuster	8867	The presidents would -- president would prefer raising taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	8868	He talks about being a fiscal conservative, or fiscally sound, but he voted over -- he voted 277 times to waive the budget caps, which would have cost the taxpayers $4.2 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	8869	I want new incentives for savings and investment for the young couples who are working hard so they can save and invest on their own on top of Social Security, not at the expense of Social Security, as the governor proposes.	0
ClaimBuster	8870	And I can't tell how proud I am of her and her family.	0
ClaimBuster	8871	And what I said was we should include those and make them enforceable.	1
ClaimBuster	8872	Now, I've told you what the intelligence briefing he received said about that.	1
ClaimBuster	8873	When we went in to Libya, and we were able to immediately stop the massacre there, because of the unique circumstances and the coalition that we had helped to organize.	1
ClaimBuster	8874	That's totally false for him to stand up here and say that.	0
ClaimBuster	8875	So, there is no ratio between taxing and balancing a budget.	1
ClaimBuster	8876	I would do the opposite in every respect.	0
ClaimBuster	8877	It's time to have somebody to step up and say look, let's let younger workers take some of their own money and under certain guidelines invest it in the private markets.	0
ClaimBuster	8878	That could protect 3 million families, 700,000 kids.	1
ClaimBuster	8879	Virginia's in the lead in this, as Governor Clinton properly said, on this identification system for firearms.	1
ClaimBuster	8880	Is America as respected throughout the world as it was?	0
ClaimBuster	8881	But they're now back in helping with elections.	1
ClaimBuster	8882	Well, he didn't include the defensive practice of medicine that costs the federal government some $28 billion a year and costs our society between $60 billion and $100 billion a year.	1
ClaimBuster	8883	There's going to be 125,000 trained by the end of this year.	1
ClaimBuster	8884	We've expanded the Brady Bill to cover people who beat up their spouses and their kids.	1
ClaimBuster	8885	It's never quite as simple as the president wants you to believe.	0
ClaimBuster	8886	And you can be part of our America and you can walk across that bridge to the 21st century with us.	0
ClaimBuster	8887	Now, the reason the Eisenhower Administration has moved, the reason that we've had the funds, for example, locally to build the schools, and the hospitals, and the highways, to make the progress that we have, is because this Administration has encouraged individual enterprise; and it has resulted in the greatest expansion of the private sector of the economy that has ever been witnessed in an eight-year period.	1
ClaimBuster	8888	You said we should have gone into Iraq, despite that fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction.	1
ClaimBuster	8889	And there's going to be an Arab summit, of the neighborhood countries.	1
ClaimBuster	8890	So I complain about that.	0
ClaimBuster	8891	WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got abundant supplies of energy here in America and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d better get after it, we better start exploring it or otherwise we'll be in deep trouble in the future because of our dependency upon foreign sources of crude.	1
ClaimBuster	8892	Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider.	1
ClaimBuster	8893	I came from a tiny town, as you know, Plains, and didn't hold public office, didn't have very much money.	1
ClaimBuster	8894	If you make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year, you will not see a single dime of your taxes go up.	1
ClaimBuster	8895	But I tell you, if you talk to teachers, they will tell you it does make a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	8896	When he took office, 32 million people were on food stamps.	1
ClaimBuster	8897	They talk about family income being up.	0
ClaimBuster	8898	Well, Mr. Carter has uh indicated that uh - he would give a blanket pardon to all uh - draft evaders.	1
ClaimBuster	8899	And nobody really knows, with the latest increase in the Wholesale Price Index - that's about 18% on an annualized basis - what it's going to be.	1
ClaimBuster	8900	No other state programs do that.	1
ClaimBuster	8901	And we have to keep our military strong.	0
ClaimBuster	8902	I think it's important to elect a president who is committed to getting this economy going again, and who realizes we have to abandon trickle-down economics and put the American people first again, and who will send programs to the Congress in the first hundred days to deal with the critical issues that America is crying out for leadership on -- jobs, incomes, the health care crisis, the need to control the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	8903	I'm offering you my own vision, my own experience, my own proposals.	0
ClaimBuster	8904	Invest in American jobs, American education, control health care costs, bring this country together again.	0
ClaimBuster	8905	I have a plan to provide for our schools so we keep the standards but we help our teachers teach and elevate our schools by funding No Child Left Behind.	0
ClaimBuster	8906	And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here.	0
ClaimBuster	8907	He said that he'd cut in half the deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	8908	And sometimes those projects, not -- not the overhead projector that Senator Obama asked for, but some of them that are really good projects, will have -- will have to be eliminated, as well.	0
ClaimBuster	8909	I don't want to say anything critical of Senator Dole, but I've never heard Mr. Ford say that that was his prim- primary consideration - Who is the best person I could choose in this country to be president of the United States?	0
ClaimBuster	8910	Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt.	1
ClaimBuster	8911	And so what I've tried to do as president is to apply those same principles.	0
ClaimBuster	8912	And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage.	1
ClaimBuster	8913	The intelligence I looked at was the same intelligence my opponent looked at, the very same intelligence.	0
ClaimBuster	8914	"We have - may have made more shots but the size of their rocket thrust and all the rest - you yourself said to Khrushchev, ""You may be ahead of us in rocket thrust but we're ahead of you in color television"" in your famous discussion in the kitchen."	1
ClaimBuster	8915	Those children will all go to college.	0
ClaimBuster	8916	Tragically, I was right: Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks.	1
ClaimBuster	8917	We've lost credibility around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	8918	Today it will take 12 generations.	0
ClaimBuster	8919	We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game.	1
ClaimBuster	8920	I saw the agreement that Prime Minister Rabin and Yassir Arafat signed on the West Bank.	1
ClaimBuster	8921	Sometimes we've been embarrassed and sometimes we've been ashamed.	0
ClaimBuster	8922	Nobody called for the invasion of Pakistan.	0
ClaimBuster	8923	Yes, we want change but we are the change.	0
ClaimBuster	8924	Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over.	0
ClaimBuster	8925	And if you have a -- if you have an elderly parent or grandparent who needs long-term care, then you will get help with that.	0
ClaimBuster	8926	Maybe somebody here has done a little business with them.	0
ClaimBuster	8927	Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them.	0
ClaimBuster	8928	"I looked into Mr. Putin's eyes, and I saw three letters, a ""K,"" a ""G,"" and a ""B."""	0
ClaimBuster	8929	Number one, if you've got health insurance, it doesn't mean a government takeover.	0
ClaimBuster	8930	The next four years we will continue to strengthen our homeland defenses.	0
ClaimBuster	8931	we had an aid - 46% of the people who enlisted in the voluntary military up until 1977 said they did so for one particular reason, the G.I.	1
ClaimBuster	8932	In terms of this one on taxes spells out the biggest difference between us.	0
ClaimBuster	8933	We have not been firm and strong.	0
ClaimBuster	8934	-- because we were worried to death that Gaddafi might be building up chemical weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	8935	You've shared your stories with me.	1
ClaimBuster	8936	But I have no loans with Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	8937	Thi- Certainly we have been speaking, I know, of whether we should have retreat or defeat.	0
ClaimBuster	8938	I also want to make sure that we get this economy going.	0
ClaimBuster	8939	I propose a detailed budget, Bob.	0
ClaimBuster	8940	Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.	1
ClaimBuster	8941	It certainly wasn't the attitude that took place out west, however.	0
ClaimBuster	8942	And as for singling people out because of race, you know, James Byrd was singled out because of his race in Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	8943	Now, my fellow Americans, that's an invitation to disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	8944	We now have about four hundred and eighty-five employees, so we've made a rather significant reduction in the number of employees on the White House staff working for the president.	1
ClaimBuster	8945	If we can just tap the intelligence and ability, the sound common sense and the good judgment of the American people, we can once again have a foreign policy to make us proud instead of ashamed.	0
ClaimBuster	8946	It's been my great honor to serve it for many, many years.	1
ClaimBuster	8947	And in the meantime, we have to be strong enough to make certain that the Soviet Union never tempts us.	0
ClaimBuster	8948	I think states should do that for new handguns, because too many criminals are getting guns.	0
ClaimBuster	8949	Our economic future depends upon whether or not our children are going to get the kind of education that lets them go on to college.	0
ClaimBuster	8950	You don't send troops to war without the body armor that they need.	0
ClaimBuster	8951	I'm not quite sure where that came in, except this, which is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you're going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you're going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best.	0
ClaimBuster	8952	That's quite different than some.	0
ClaimBuster	8953	And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.	1
ClaimBuster	8954	But I would cite that as a major accomplishment.	0
ClaimBuster	8955	Now that means the best leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	8956	It means addressing the problems of injustice and inequity, along the lines of race and ethnicity here at home, because in all these other places around the world where they're having these terrible problems, when they feel hope, it is often because they see in us a reflection of their potential.	0
ClaimBuster	8957	It's a tax that taxes people twice.	1
ClaimBuster	8958	I'm proud of that work, again, bipartisan, reaching across the aisle, working together, Democrat and Republican alike.	0
ClaimBuster	8959	Now that will change America.	0
ClaimBuster	8960	Equality of opportunity in the field of housing, which could be done on all federal supported housing by a stroke of the president's pen.	1
ClaimBuster	8961	We had to do something, and even though not all of our allies supported it at first, I think most of them now believe that what we did was an appropriate thing to do.	0
ClaimBuster	8962	Mr. Nixon talks about our being the strongest country in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	8963	And we know that there were further diplomatic efforts under way.	0
ClaimBuster	8964	And certainly, I'm not proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	8965	So we have two that I'd put as number one.	0
ClaimBuster	8966	The Russians are preventing significant action in the United Nations Security Council.	1
ClaimBuster	8967	It costs about $27,000 to pay people to volunteer.	1
ClaimBuster	8968	And so seeing Syria remove Assad is a very high priority for us.	0
ClaimBuster	8969	The president's put it in place as much public debt -- almost as much debt held by the public as al prior presidents combined.	1
ClaimBuster	8970	The last thing I think we should do is something I have been trying to do since I have been president, is every time I do something in a public way, I try to have a real American citizen there who is directly affected by it so that people can see the connection of what happens way across the country, in Washington with more police on the street, in San Diego, clean up the sewage here in San Diego, doubling the border guards here in Southern California, that there is a connection between what we do way back there and what we do here.	1
ClaimBuster	8971	We want the government to pinch their pennies for a change instead of the people pinching their pennies.	0
ClaimBuster	8972	Not as part of the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores.	0
ClaimBuster	8973	We have bridges and tunnels that aren't being secured, chemical plants, nuclear plants that aren't secured, hospitals that are overcrowded with their emergency rooms.	0
ClaimBuster	8974	But it's very important that we not overstep our bounds and I think most people -- most police officers are good, dedicated, honorable citizens who are doing their job, putting their lives at risk who aren't bigoted or aren't prejudiced.	0
ClaimBuster	8975	I believe that we must be able to compete in the market - steel and in all the basic commodities abroad - we must be able to compete against them because we always did because of our technological lead.	0
ClaimBuster	8976	There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this.	0
ClaimBuster	8977	And I'll take responsibility for them.	0
ClaimBuster	8978	And at that point they'll just be like apples falling out of a tree.	0
ClaimBuster	8979	And he took a tremendous pounding and everybody now knows that he took a very unfair pounding.	0
ClaimBuster	8980	We're far away from that now.	0
ClaimBuster	8981	A recent poll was taken among 1,000 enlisted personnel, as well as officers, over half of whom will leave the service when their time of enlistment is up.	1
ClaimBuster	8982	We've got to stop this greed and excess.	0
ClaimBuster	8983	He's talking about that fantastic plan of the Administration to take thousands and thousands of square miles out in the Western states.	0
ClaimBuster	8984	Stop scaring the seniors, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	8985	Thank you very, very much.	0
ClaimBuster	8986	We're not going to get rid of all regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	8987	You have to have regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	8988	I would say this; that we, of course, expect to pick up some seats in both in the House and the Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	8989	But I just find it fascinating that while we sit here tonight we will go into debt an additional $50 million in an hour and a half.	1
ClaimBuster	8990	Medicare, I know you talked about it, but Medicare is relevant for all of us, young and old alike.	1
ClaimBuster	8991	I know what it means to be poor.	0
ClaimBuster	8992	It's so ridiculous what she -- she will defeat ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	8993	I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America.	1
ClaimBuster	8994	But, good as this record is, may I emphasize it isn't enough.	0
ClaimBuster	8995	That's what I learned in Vietnam.	0
ClaimBuster	8996	That's why I'm a big proponent of clean coal technology, to make sure we can use coal but in a clean way.	0
ClaimBuster	8997	The program that I have advocated is one which departs from the present program that we have in this respect.	1
ClaimBuster	8998	Well, the president took Detroit bankrupt.	1
ClaimBuster	8999	There needs to be flexibility for teacher training and teacher hiring with federal money.	0
ClaimBuster	9000	I'm going to find people that want to serve their country.	0
ClaimBuster	9001	We'll make sure they do not end up with weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	9002	And there were many people, like myself, who opposed quotas, who felt there were places where it was overreaching.	1
ClaimBuster	9003	Step one, if I get up there, we're going to clean that up.	0
ClaimBuster	9004	I have never supported quotas.	1
ClaimBuster	9005	Well he made the promise.	1
ClaimBuster	9006	And, as a matter of fact, we haven't avoided arms control talks with the Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	9007	We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals.	0
ClaimBuster	9008	And the American people are willing to have fair, shared sacrifice.	0
ClaimBuster	9009	Under the Medicare prescription drug proposal I'm making, here is how it works, you go to your own doctor.	1
ClaimBuster	9010	And so while it's true that nobody's completely innocent here, we have had over the last eight years the biggest increases in deficit spending and national debt in our history.	1
ClaimBuster	9011	We had the biggest drop in income inequality in 27 years in 1995.	1
ClaimBuster	9012	Now that represents the opportunity we have to take advantage of.	0
ClaimBuster	9013	I said last week I believed in a balanced budget.	1
ClaimBuster	9014	Middle class Americans are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago and they're paying higher taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	9015	And so what I do is I bring down the tax rates, lower deductions and exemptions, the same idea behind Bowles-Simpson, by the way, get the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions, to create more jobs, because there's nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more money, paying more taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	9016	The choices were not good then.	0
ClaimBuster	9017	We could uh - also uh - help our youths with some of the proposals that uh - would give to young people an opportunity to work and learn at the same time just like we give money to young people who are going to college.	0
ClaimBuster	9018	I think most of the economic growth that has taken place is a result of ingenuity and hard work and entrepreneurship and that's the role of goverment to encourage that.	0
ClaimBuster	9019	Senator Obama was wrong about Iraq and the surge.	0
ClaimBuster	9020	No president, through all of American history, has ever ceded, and nor would I, the right to preempt in any way necessary to protect the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	9021	We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines.	0
ClaimBuster	9022	And therefore if we are to have peace, we must know how to deal with the Communists and their leaders.	0
ClaimBuster	9023	Government ought to stand on the side of parents.	0
ClaimBuster	9024	And we've got to attend to them.	0
ClaimBuster	9025	And they buried it till right after the election.	1
ClaimBuster	9026	And when he -- excuse me.	0
ClaimBuster	9027	Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK?	0
ClaimBuster	9028	You can't keep on holding down the value of your currency, stealing our intellectual property, counterfeiting our products, selling them around the world, even to the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	9029	Five million Americans have lost their health insurance in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	9030	If you want somebody who will fight for you and who will fight to have middle-class tax cuts, then I am your man.	0
ClaimBuster	9031	I ran the -- the state of Massachusetts as a governor, to the extent any governor does, and balanced the budget all four years.	1
ClaimBuster	9032	The best America is yet to come.	0
ClaimBuster	9033	But I've had my anxious moments in my life.	0
ClaimBuster	9034	And in 2006, our seniors will get a prescription drug coverage in Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	9035	I see our trade deficit with China, larger than it's -- growing larger every year, as a matter of fact.	1
ClaimBuster	9036	All these specific examples I'm giving tonight -- if you had a business like that, they'd be leading you away and boarding up the doors.	0
ClaimBuster	9037	I try to meet them and I insist that people who work for me meet them, if they don't, they don't stick around very long.	0
ClaimBuster	9038	Well, I think during the campaign, particularly now during this difficult period, we ought to be speaking with one voice, and I appreciate the way the administration has worked hard to calm the tensions.	0
ClaimBuster	9039	But yet, after conceding that, he still says that he would oppose the surge if he had to decide that again today.	1
ClaimBuster	9040	You get more money, you keep more of your taxes by going abroad.	1
ClaimBuster	9041	And we've never had a president since the War between the States that vetoed more bills.	1
ClaimBuster	9042	But when a narcotics wrapped up guy goes in and murders a police officer, I think they ought to pay with their life.	0
ClaimBuster	9043	Every time we've made a serious mistake in foreign affairs, it's been because the American people have been excluded from the process.	0
ClaimBuster	9044	The grain sales have been a benefit to American agriculture.	0
ClaimBuster	9045	If you take care of an elderly in your home, you're going to get the personal exemption increased.	1
ClaimBuster	9046	And I think that everything you do in public life has to be guided by your faith, affected by your faith, but without transferring it in any official way to other people.	0
ClaimBuster	9047	No, they haven't had talks in two years.	1
ClaimBuster	9048	We feel that uh - in education we can have a slight increase - not a major increase.	0
ClaimBuster	9049	You own your own account.	1
ClaimBuster	9050	It's our obligation to make sure that we give him the finest products in the world to put together and we don't break his legs in the process.	0
ClaimBuster	9051	And this is uh - the point of my first statistics that I gave you - that - that the present tax benefits that have been carved out over a long period of years - fifty years - by sharp tax lawyers and by lobbyists have benefited just the rich.	1
ClaimBuster	9052	In the election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln said the question was whether this nation could exist half-slave or half-free.	1
ClaimBuster	9053	They are plotting to kill Americans right now.	1
ClaimBuster	9054	He wanted to give us this big system, that took over about one-seventh of the economy, that put on price controls, created all these state alliances, and would cost $1.5 trillion and force people into managed care, whether they wanted it or not.	1
ClaimBuster	9055	And they believe it because they know I would not take my eye off of the goal: Osama bin Laden.	1
ClaimBuster	9056	I supported the President's trade policy.	1
ClaimBuster	9057	We talk about it all the time.	0
ClaimBuster	9058	Well, as I say, we have to look at what an overthrow there would mean and what the government would be that would follow.	0
ClaimBuster	9059	So here's what I would do.	0
ClaimBuster	9060	Senator McCain cut -- Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didn't believe in a timetable.	1
ClaimBuster	9061	"He said, ""I am a strong liberal Democrat"" - August, '87."	1
ClaimBuster	9062	But I think in retrospect we were too late getting in there.	0
ClaimBuster	9063	South Korea faces a very delicate situation.	0
ClaimBuster	9064	You know, I think about Missy Johnson.	0
ClaimBuster	9065	You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits for...	0
ClaimBuster	9066	It shouldn't be that way.	0
ClaimBuster	9067	First of all, remember that in this campaign season, since Senator Dole's been a candidate, he has bragged about the fact that he voted against Medicare in the beginning, in 1965, one of only 12 members.	1
ClaimBuster	9068	This is for Governor Romney?	0
ClaimBuster	9069	And these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business.	1
ClaimBuster	9070	Let me tell you what the facts are.	0
ClaimBuster	9071	If they do, then they will have heard the harsh reality of what we have to do.	0
ClaimBuster	9072	Our children will not see the American dream because of this debt that somebody somewhere dropped on us.	0
ClaimBuster	9073	Secondly was the federal aid to education bill.	0
ClaimBuster	9074	And it's continuing to evolve, and it's evolving in favor of life.	0
ClaimBuster	9075	That has not proven to be effective, and therefore, I think the better way is to go after the criminal, the individual who commits a crime in the possession of a gun and uses that gun for a part of his criminal activity.	0
ClaimBuster	9076	"You might say, ""Well, you got an example of one that worked better?"""	0
ClaimBuster	9077	Mr. Ford, so far as I know, except for avoiding another Watergate, has not accomplished one single major program for this country.	1
ClaimBuster	9078	I believe those troops deserve better than what they are getting today.	0
ClaimBuster	9079	But we are clearly better off than we were four years ago, as Senator Dole acknowledged this year.	1
ClaimBuster	9080	Look, we're gonna face some serious new challenges in the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	9081	I appreciate the fact that his daughters have been so kind to my daughters in what has been a pretty hard experience for, I guess, young girls, seeing their dads out there campaigning.	0
ClaimBuster	9082	The President was opposed to it in 1993.	1
ClaimBuster	9083	It is also essential in being alert that we be fair; fair because by being fair we uphold the very freedoms that the Communists would destroy.	0
ClaimBuster	9084	Well, the other day my opponent was given a briefing by the CIA.	1
ClaimBuster	9085	You call yourself the King of Debt.	0
ClaimBuster	9086	Paula Jones, who's also here tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	9087	But let me say to you, Mr. Vice President, we're happy with our laws on our books.	1
ClaimBuster	9088	What I'm against is Senator Dole's plan to take money away from all the children we now help with limited Federal funds and help far fewer.	1
ClaimBuster	9089	I know how these people think.	0
ClaimBuster	9090	And what you want to do to Joe the plumber and millions more like him is have their taxes increased and not be able to realize the American dream of owning their own business.	0
ClaimBuster	9091	Then the question is, can we govern?	0
ClaimBuster	9092	All the nuclear weapons are not dismantled.	1
ClaimBuster	9093	Now, the Social Security tax of '77 -- this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest.	0
ClaimBuster	9094	Senator Obama still doesn't quite understand -- or doesn't get it -- that if we fail in Iraq, it encourages Al Qaida.	0
ClaimBuster	9095	He just doesn't understand how the borders work, evidently, to say that.	0
ClaimBuster	9096	It isn't enough to compare what might have been done eight years ago, or ten years ago, or fifteen years ago, or twenty years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	9097	In the Middle East, we've worked for a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, successfully, and have tied ourselves together with Israel and Egypt in a common defense capability.	1
ClaimBuster	9098	Third, not to make any sales of materiel or weapons to a nation which is involved in terrorist activities.	0
ClaimBuster	9099	We need to say here's your tax incentive: if you create American jobs, the old-fashioned way.	0
ClaimBuster	9100	And one thing I have to say.	0
ClaimBuster	9101	Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they've wanted to do forever, but we've made it so easy for them.	1
ClaimBuster	9102	I think you have to help doctors stop practicing defensive medicine.	0
ClaimBuster	9103	Now, he misled the American people in his speech when he said we will plan carefully.	1
ClaimBuster	9104	He put $139 billion of windfall profit into the pockets of the drug companies right out of your pockets.	1
ClaimBuster	9105	That's why my balanced budget plan will still invest and grow this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	9106	And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down.	1
ClaimBuster	9107	We will select the best man we can get.	0
ClaimBuster	9108	There has been reference to expensive spare parts, hammers costing $500.	1
ClaimBuster	9109	Chiang Kai-shek will not withdraw.	0
ClaimBuster	9110	I have a plan to protect the environment so that we leave this place in better shape to our children than we were handed it by our parents.	1
ClaimBuster	9111	And uh - the individuals that uh - with whom I've consulted have not uh - convinced me that uh - a national registration of handguns or handgun owners will solve the problem you're talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	9112	I support the right to keep and bear arms.	0
ClaimBuster	9113	The President exempts the IRS which creates three-fourths of the paperwork.	1
ClaimBuster	9114	Mr. Stone, in my State of the Union address earlier this year, I pointed out that any threat to the stability or security of the Persian Gulf would be a threat to the security of our own country.	1
ClaimBuster	9115	Our long-term interest rates are still pretty high because of our deficit and because of our economic performance.	1
ClaimBuster	9116	support the uh - Republican uh - platform, which calls for the constitutional amendment that would uh - outlaw abortions.	1
ClaimBuster	9117	It's not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want.	0
ClaimBuster	9118	We pursued Al Qaida wherever Al Qaida tries to hide.	0
ClaimBuster	9119	We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions.	0
ClaimBuster	9120	"If we don't have access to their markets the same way they've access our markets, we ought to say, ""Wait, that's enough."	0
ClaimBuster	9121	And we're going to have to help the Pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people.	0
ClaimBuster	9122	Now, after all of those investigations by objective, responsible people, I think the matter is closed once and for all.	0
ClaimBuster	9123	Now, I believe that a President must command that White House and those who work for him.	0
ClaimBuster	9124	And let me say this-all he can talk about-he goes around ranting about Noriega.	0
ClaimBuster	9125	And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently.	0
ClaimBuster	9126	The governor has proposed skipping the next generation of weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	9127	"And I once called on somebody, ""Well, change your behavior."	1
ClaimBuster	9128	Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	9129	That gets to the national honor.	0
ClaimBuster	9130	That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	9131	And so I say both the candidates and both the vice presidential candidates, I would hope as well - including Senator Johnson - should talk on this issue at every opportunity.	0
ClaimBuster	9132	The most important thing we can do is to make sure we control our own energy.	0
ClaimBuster	9133	And nothing has been done, and they are now charging to take tourists there to see this terrible desolation.	1
ClaimBuster	9134	One of the most important things is to continue the research and development component.	0
ClaimBuster	9135	We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali.	1
ClaimBuster	9136	And then you cut education spending when you came into office.	1
ClaimBuster	9137	And meanwhile, North Korea has got nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	9138	As a matter of fact, in the proposal for the Alaska lands legislation, 100% of all the offshore lands would be open for exploration, and 95% of all the Alaska lands, where it is suspected or believed that minerals might exist.	1
ClaimBuster	9139	There is now a federal judge's opinion about the current management of this program ordering the State of Texas to do -- you should read that judge's language about this.	1
ClaimBuster	9140	We reduced our industrial waste by 11%.	1
ClaimBuster	9141	This Janet Yellen of the Fed.	0
ClaimBuster	9142	Medical care for the aged, I would put under social security.	0
ClaimBuster	9143	And we ask you for our hand for your hands and your hearts, and your votes on the 8th of November so we can move forward in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	9144	Now, I believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertaxed; it's that government is overfed.	0
ClaimBuster	9145	And his Secretary of the Treasury said he's studying a sales tax or a value-added tax.	1
ClaimBuster	9146	And local -- it's not enough to leave it up to the local school districts.	0
ClaimBuster	9147	Let me say this about AIDS.	0
ClaimBuster	9148	I wouldn't have sent troops to Haiti.	0
ClaimBuster	9149	And the black market sale price was about $250 million.	1
ClaimBuster	9150	I will not cut our commitment to our military.	0
ClaimBuster	9151	But we cannot guarantee equal results in America.	0
ClaimBuster	9152	The claim that it would have put hundred and forty thousand miners out of work is uh - hard to believe, when at the time Mr. Ford vetoed it, the United Mine Workers was uh - supporting the bill.	1
ClaimBuster	9153	He's called them phony and fuzzy.	0
ClaimBuster	9154	So, in terms of priorities, we've got to be financially strong.	0
ClaimBuster	9155	And I'm going to try to do better.	0
ClaimBuster	9156	Now this tax bill - that hasn't reached the White House yet, but is expected in a day or two - it's about fifteen hundred pages.	1
ClaimBuster	9157	This has hurt this country, and a President's supposed to command.	0
ClaimBuster	9158	Now, Senator McCain talks about small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	9159	As I indicated earlier, we did agree on a twenty-four-hundred limitation on uh - uh - launchers of ballistic missiles.	1
ClaimBuster	9160	We're going to have to come up with alternatives, and that means that the United States government is working with the private sector to fund the kind of innovation that we can then export to countries like China that also need energy and are setting up one coal power plant a week.	1
ClaimBuster	9161	We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people.	0
ClaimBuster	9162	The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule.	1
ClaimBuster	9163	I think we can do better.	0
ClaimBuster	9164	I have recommended to the Congress that we develop the uranium enrichment plant at Portsmouth, Ohio, which is a publicly owned - U.S. government facility and have indicated that the private program which would follow on in Alabama is one that may or may not uhh - be constructed.	1
ClaimBuster	9165	I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course.	0
ClaimBuster	9166	I disagree with both of them.	0
ClaimBuster	9167	He's already taken that off the board, capital gains are going to continue to be at a low rate so we -- we're not going to get money that way.	1
ClaimBuster	9168	You look at Haiti, where we spend about three billion dollars and we got an alarm call there about two weeks ago.	1
ClaimBuster	9169	I think we need a president who has the credibility to bring the allies back to the table and to do what's necessary to make it so America isn't doing this alone.	0
ClaimBuster	9170	When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year.	1
ClaimBuster	9171	So -- but, look, you're not interested in hearing politicians pointing fingers.	0
ClaimBuster	9172	It's about my vision for America and about his liberal vision for America.	0
ClaimBuster	9173	Obviously if Social Security is a very important program, it should -- it will be preserved.	0
ClaimBuster	9174	And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record.	0
ClaimBuster	9175	My plan drops the rate from 15% to 10% and increases the child credit from $500 to $1,000 to make the code more fair for everybody, not just a few, not just a handful.	1
ClaimBuster	9176	And as a result, the families of some of our young servicemen are on food stamps today.	1
ClaimBuster	9177	I see it as a security issue, I see it as an economic issue, and I see it as a human-rights issue.	0
ClaimBuster	9178	I got a letter today as I left Sarasota, Florida.	1
ClaimBuster	9179	I think we got to stay that way and continue to increase our capabilities to meet any potential threat.	0
ClaimBuster	9180	What I said was that this matter should be thoroughly gone into to make sure that there aren't loopholes.	1
ClaimBuster	9181	It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance.	0
ClaimBuster	9182	Keep the Federal Reserve independent, but let's live in a world of reality.	0
ClaimBuster	9183	But let's not put it there; let's put it in terms of the average family.	0
ClaimBuster	9184	You had a surgeon -- or before General McCaffrey (ph) you had a lady who said we ought to consider legalizing drugs.	1
ClaimBuster	9185	For the first time in history, you will be taxing people's health care benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	9186	He didn't happen to see that light during the first three years as a member of the United States Senate, $932 million in requests.	0
ClaimBuster	9187	Do you remember the Senator from Boston chanting out there and the ridicule factor from that lady from Texas that was on there; I mean, come on, this was just outrageous.	0
ClaimBuster	9188	I hope he would grant me the same.	0
ClaimBuster	9189	This nation of ours has got a solemn duty to defeat this ideology of hate.	0
ClaimBuster	9190	You've suggested a commission, Newt Gingrich did, I suggested that at least four or five years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	9191	I do it because it's the responsibility of leadership, I do it because we have to solve this problem together.	0
ClaimBuster	9192	And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families.	1
ClaimBuster	9193	Now, I know that this has been called inflationary by my opponent and by the man who isn't here tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	9194	In other words, what I'm talking about is not putting government back to getting less money than government's been getting, but simply cutting the increase in in spending.	0
ClaimBuster	9195	Thank you, all of you, for taking part.	0
ClaimBuster	9196	But we didn't use American forces, the best trained in the world, to go kill him.	1
ClaimBuster	9197	He tried to keep it from coming to my desk.	1
ClaimBuster	9198	I'm going to get it right for those soldiers, because it's important to Israel, it's important to America, it's important to the world, it's important to the fight on terror.	0
ClaimBuster	9199	He did not say that.	1
ClaimBuster	9200	But Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s and the economic policies of the 1920s.	1
ClaimBuster	9201	I said that we would create jobs for our people, and we did -- 6 million in the last 20 or 21 months.	1
ClaimBuster	9202	The middle class is getting crushed under the policies of a president who has not understood what it takes to get the economy working again.	0
ClaimBuster	9203	You should expect that from both of us.	0
ClaimBuster	9204	It's been my record as Governor of Texas, it will be how I conduct myself if I'm fortunate enough to earn your vote as President of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	9205	Governor Carter skims over a very serious and a very broad subject.	0
ClaimBuster	9206	A free Iraq will set a powerful example in the part of the world that is desperate for freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	9207	My cutbacks will be done through attrition, by the way.	0
ClaimBuster	9208	The other things are false, but honestly, I'd love to talk about getting rid of ISIS, and I'd love to talk about other things...	0
ClaimBuster	9209	Not until again in 1996 -- I don't want anybody to smoke.	0
ClaimBuster	9210	Margaret, may I go back and just say to the vice president that I didn't raid the pension fund of Massachusetts you are dead wrong, George, we didn't do that.	1
ClaimBuster	9211	Jim, we have a direct disagreement on this.	0
ClaimBuster	9212	They do have stakes in it.	0
ClaimBuster	9213	But the dictator Milosevic was hanging on.	1
ClaimBuster	9214	But don't get into this smoke screen here Oscar.	0
ClaimBuster	9215	If you're in a very poor family or if you have very high costs, Medicare will pay all the costs, a $25 premium, and much better benefits than you can possibly find in the private sector.	1
ClaimBuster	9216	There are 4 million people who are waiting in line to get here legally.	1
ClaimBuster	9217	Where the Soviet Union has acted irresponsibly, as they have in many of those countries, especially, recently, in Poland, I believe we ought to insist that Western credits extended to the Soviet Union bear the market rate.	0
ClaimBuster	9218	She wants to have open borders.	1
ClaimBuster	9219	I know the morality that's prompting that question, and I respect it enormously.	0
ClaimBuster	9220	And John spoke about 15 years ago, on the position that he.	0
ClaimBuster	9221	And there's been a constant squabbling between the president and the Congress, and that's not the way this country ought to be run.	0
ClaimBuster	9222	And so let me just say this.	0
ClaimBuster	9223	I mean, it seemed to me at the time the assault weapon ban was not effective.	0
ClaimBuster	9224	Is -- is al-Qaida on the run, on its heels?	0
ClaimBuster	9225	He said that there could be secretary-level and lower level meetings.	1
ClaimBuster	9226	I felt like unchecked Milosevic would harm NATO, and so it depends on the situation, Mr. Vice President.	0
ClaimBuster	9227	I think from the very beginning, one of the challenges we've had with Iran is that they have looked at this administration, and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be.	0
ClaimBuster	9228	"That I don't think is an example of ""speaking softly."""	0
ClaimBuster	9229	A message just won't do it.	0
ClaimBuster	9230	And, by the way, if a state gets in trouble, well, we can step in and see if we can find a way to help them.	0
ClaimBuster	9231	Here is Ahmadinenene (ph), Ahmadinejad, who is, Ahmadinejad, who is now in New York, talking about the extermination of the State of Israel, of wiping Israel off the map, and we're going to sit down, without precondition, across the table, to legitimize and give a propaganda platform to a person that is espousing the extermination of the state of Israel, and therefore then giving them more credence in the world arena and therefore saying, they've probably been doing the right thing, because you will sit down across the table from them and that will legitimize their illegal behavior.	1
ClaimBuster	9232	In fact, when I fell off the podium in Chico, before I lit the ground, hit the ground I had call on my cell phone from a trial lawyer saying I think we've got a case here.	1
ClaimBuster	9233	The governor's wife has been very active in the homeless.	1
ClaimBuster	9234	I was seeing B-52s, they're old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them.	1
ClaimBuster	9235	One of the commitments that I made was to deregulate the major industries of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	9236	Your question is difficult to answer, because, in the situation right now, no one wants to say anything that would inadvertently delay, in any way, the return of those hostages if there if there is a chance that they're coming home soon, or that might cause them harm.	0
ClaimBuster	9237	And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard.	0
ClaimBuster	9238	There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him.	1
ClaimBuster	9239	Health-care costs for the average American have gone up 64 percent; tuitions have gone up 35 percent; gasoline prices up 30 percent; Medicare premiums went up 17 percent a few days ago; prescription drugs are up 12 percent a year.	1
ClaimBuster	9240	You don't test every year.	0
ClaimBuster	9241	I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC.	1
ClaimBuster	9242	(Laughter, scattered applause) I'm serious though I think I'm a little more lovable these days than I used to be back in my youth when I began in my state legislature.	0
ClaimBuster	9243	He says he wants a system that will make nuclear wars safe, so nobody's going to get hurt.	0
ClaimBuster	9244	I think we have to respect that.	0
ClaimBuster	9245	We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations.	1
ClaimBuster	9246	And we can do better than the past administration has done.	0
ClaimBuster	9247	That will not help us compete with China.	1
ClaimBuster	9248	We've become almost a welfare state.	0
ClaimBuster	9249	We found out today that over the past 13 months, we've added 1.9 million new jobs in the last 13 months.	1
ClaimBuster	9250	And when we have to find twenty-five thousand new jobs a week for the next ten years, we're going to have to grow more.	0
ClaimBuster	9251	A free Iraq is essential for the security of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	9252	But what we need is financial reform; we need some real financial reform, banking reform legislation.	0
ClaimBuster	9253	Carole, the thing that saved us in this global economic slowdown has been our exports, and what I'm trying to do is increase our exports.	1
ClaimBuster	9254	I think one of the hallmarks of my relationship in Austin, Texas, is that I've had the capacity to work with both Republicans and Democrats.	0
ClaimBuster	9255	We've got to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't want us very -- like us very much.	1
ClaimBuster	9256	So I'm the only one that's untarnished at this point?	0
ClaimBuster	9257	We need to have strong allies.	0
ClaimBuster	9258	But at the same time, I think it's going to take a dramatic measure of that kind to convince the American people that we will have to reduce the use of the private automobile.	0
ClaimBuster	9259	And I heard them ask just for something that would give them hope.	1
ClaimBuster	9260	Now, hundreds, thousands of good, decent people, whole cities up here in this state are adversely impacted because they would not move in a timely way.	1
ClaimBuster	9261	I favor that rather than massive federal spending programs which will come into effect usually long after you've passed through the recessionary period.	0
ClaimBuster	9262	We've got to make sure that we're hardening our chemical sites.	0
ClaimBuster	9263	In some cases, they're murderers, drug lords, drug problems.	1
ClaimBuster	9264	So I think that could help.	0
ClaimBuster	9265	Now, of all times in America, we need to cut people's taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	9266	If we're not an economic superpower, we're a used to be and we will no longer be a force for good throughout the world.	0
ClaimBuster	9267	I will tell you I'm the kind of person, I don't hire or fire somebody based upon their sexual orientation.	0
ClaimBuster	9268	Number two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	9269	He said when I took office, the price of gasoline was $1.80, $1.86.	1
ClaimBuster	9270	You know, Bob, I don't know.	0
ClaimBuster	9271	What I said was that ten years ago, we were producing twice as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union and today they're producing twice as many as we are, and that this affects our security around the world.	1
ClaimBuster	9272	On one of those tapes may be the enemy being right the next time.	0
ClaimBuster	9273	Well, it starts with enforcing law.	0
ClaimBuster	9274	You see the turmoil in Poland today.	0
ClaimBuster	9275	Mr. Bush made that charge.	1
ClaimBuster	9276	I'd like to ask the Governor to join in getting for the president what 43 governors have, the line-item veto.	1
ClaimBuster	9277	We have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history.	1
ClaimBuster	9278	I think the choice is clear and it involves the future.	0
ClaimBuster	9279	So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court.	0
ClaimBuster	9280	But I'm running on the record of what we have asked for.	0
ClaimBuster	9281	If we invest now in our young people and their ability to go to college, that will allow them to drive this economy into the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	9282	So that really isn't an issue in this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	9283	I tell it like it is.	0
ClaimBuster	9284	I want everybody to know should I be the president Israel's going to be our friend.	0
ClaimBuster	9285	I'm a governor of state and I don't like it when the federal government tells us what to do.	1
ClaimBuster	9286	In September 2003, he supported amnesty for illegal aliens.	1
ClaimBuster	9287	This administration tried to take over healthcare and impose a governmental system.	1
ClaimBuster	9288	The gun lobby's on his side.	1
ClaimBuster	9289	And it also requires us to maintain some continuity -- some bipartisan American commitment to certain principles.	0
ClaimBuster	9290	He has promised a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund for young working adults to invest and save on their own.	1
ClaimBuster	9291	We have demanded that the American people sacrifice, and they have done very well.	0
ClaimBuster	9292	I have kept the faith with our country.	0
ClaimBuster	9293	I have a better plan to be able to fight the war on terror by strengthening our military, strengthening our intelligence, by going after the financing more authoritatively, by doing what we need to do to rebuild the alliances, by reaching out to the Muslim world, which the president has almost not done, and beginning to isolate the radical Islamic Muslims, not have them isolate the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	9294	And my tax cut does not come close to eliminating that $86 billion increase.	1
ClaimBuster	9295	The test of whether America moves is whether the federal government, plus the state government, plus the local government, plus the biggest segment of all - individual enterprise - moves.	0
ClaimBuster	9296	At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here.	0
ClaimBuster	9297	Maybe they -- they probably are addictive.	0
ClaimBuster	9298	I cannot still understand why this Administration and Mr. Nixon oppose putting medical care for the aged under Social Security to give them some security.	1
ClaimBuster	9299	They're working harder and higher and harder paying more taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	9300	Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.	1
ClaimBuster	9301	So 80% -- now the problem with completely eliminating it goes back to the wealthiest 1%.	1
ClaimBuster	9302	I think the American people want a Republican president to check on any excesses that come out of the next Congress, if it is a Democratic Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	9303	We're suing each other too much and caring for each other too little.	0
ClaimBuster	9304	I think it's, frankly, not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and they're going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives.	0
ClaimBuster	9305	I'm in favor of testing as a way of measuring performance.	1
ClaimBuster	9306	Let's do it that way.	0
ClaimBuster	9307	It will actually raise taxes on nine million people and, in addition to that, it will force bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment than the ones that he and Mr. Gingrich passed that I vetoed last year.	1
ClaimBuster	9308	Some time ago, Mr. Mondale said something about education and college students and help of that kind.	1
ClaimBuster	9309	Well, thank you, Oliver, and that's an excellent question, because as you just described it, bailout, when I believe that it's rescue, because -- because of the greed and excess in Washington and Wall Street, Main Street was paying a very heavy price, and we know that.	1
ClaimBuster	9310	We've got a whole bunch of countries that pay a price for dealing with the United States of America now.	1
ClaimBuster	9311	He talked about the fact that Iraqis love to be free.	0
ClaimBuster	9312	And that cost us revenue.	1
ClaimBuster	9313	"Yes, I had used -- ""last resort'' would always be with me."	0
ClaimBuster	9314	But 9/11 changed it all.	0
ClaimBuster	9315	It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009.	1
ClaimBuster	9316	So we have a long way to go in our intelligence services.	0
ClaimBuster	9317	We need to do this together and we can.	0
ClaimBuster	9318	John Kennedy proposed cutting capital gains.	1
ClaimBuster	9319	So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.	0
ClaimBuster	9320	Iran has power over North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	9321	It was just right through the roof.	0
ClaimBuster	9322	The president has been AWOL for four years.	1
ClaimBuster	9323	We have to practice what we preach.	0
ClaimBuster	9324	Ambassador Glaspie did a lot of talking right after July 25 and that's a fact and it's in all the newspapers.	1
ClaimBuster	9325	We need to be doing more in education, not less.	0
ClaimBuster	9326	Saddam Hussein had no intention of disarming.	0
ClaimBuster	9327	And, number four, we've got to make sure that we're helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country.	0
ClaimBuster	9328	I have fought against excessive spending and outrages.	1
ClaimBuster	9329	We have to have strong borders.	0
ClaimBuster	9330	Our hearts go out to you.	0
ClaimBuster	9331	Then at the end of the war, when they had to go testify about it, their stories are a total disconnect from what they said in August, September and October.	1
ClaimBuster	9332	We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator.	1
ClaimBuster	9333	I remember what the administration tried to do in 1993.	0
ClaimBuster	9334	During the course of the campaign in 1994 I was asked do you support the death penalty.	1
ClaimBuster	9335	The difference is that while my plan starts with new accountability and maintains local control, it doesn't stop there.	0
ClaimBuster	9336	Now, we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance, with an emphasis on the prevention of disease, an emphasis on out-patient care, not in-patient care; an emphasis on hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care far those who are ill, an emphasis on catastrophic health insurance, so that if a family is threatened with being wiped out economically because of a very high medical bill, then the insurance would help pay for it.	0
ClaimBuster	9337	The drunk driver had no money.	1
ClaimBuster	9338	I have seen Communism abroad.	0
ClaimBuster	9339	I have a clear record of bipartisanship.	1
ClaimBuster	9340	Second, in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	9341	Just again, the example of the eloquence of Senator Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	9342	Number four, the rule of law.	0
ClaimBuster	9343	And I was very strong.	0
ClaimBuster	9344	He said he would work through a real alliance.	1
ClaimBuster	9345	In addition to that, we need to have - uh a realization that we've got uh about thirty-five years worth of oil left in the whole world.	1
ClaimBuster	9346	Now, it's true that I say that you are going to have to make sure that your child has health care, because children are relatively cheap to insure and we don't want them going to the emergency room for treatable illnesses like asthma.	0
ClaimBuster	9347	We need an investment incentive to modernize plant and equipment; we've got to control the health care costs for those people -- otherwise we can't keep the manufacturing jobs here; and we need a tough trade policy that is fair, that insists on open markets in return for open markets.	0
ClaimBuster	9348	We have a lot of differences in our country, and some of us believe that other people's decisions are wrong, even immoral.	0
ClaimBuster	9349	And I believe the American people have to make the choice on November eighth between the view of whether we have to move ahead faster, whether what we're doing now is not satisfactory, whether we have to build greater strength at home and abroad and Mr. Nixon's view.	0
ClaimBuster	9350	That was the wrong judgment, and it's been costly to us.	0
ClaimBuster	9351	If you want to stop talking about it and do it, then I'll be glad to go up there and we'll get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	9352	At the same time, in our Judeo-Christian tradition, we recognize the right of taking a human life in self-defense.	1
ClaimBuster	9353	I think the real winners of the debates were the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	9354	Here a CCC type program would be appropriate to channel money into the ah - cha- in - in into the sharing with the private sector and also local and state governments to employ young people who are now out of work.	0
ClaimBuster	9355	And that's what this country should be doing.	0
ClaimBuster	9356	Meanwhile, the Democrats in the Senate and some -- and some members of Congress defended what Fannie and Freddie were doing.	1
ClaimBuster	9357	I think he gets a -- oh, I'm sorry, you're right, go ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	9358	We're a nation that believes in the Second Amendment, and I believe in the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	9359	Why wouldn't we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets?	0
ClaimBuster	9360	We need to encourage business, create jobs, not spread the wealth around.	0
ClaimBuster	9361	I will release my tax returns -- against my lawyer's wishes -- when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted.	1
ClaimBuster	9362	Governor Clinton keeps hitting me on vetoing legislation.	1
ClaimBuster	9363	Again, I will say I will do my best to make this a discussion of ideas and issues, not insults.	0
ClaimBuster	9364	And that's to make sure the education system works.	0
ClaimBuster	9365	You voted to increase taxes 98 times.	1
ClaimBuster	9366	I would pick somebody who would strictly interpret the Constitution of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	9367	Now, this is not standing still.	0
ClaimBuster	9368	I think we've been fighting from day one to do something about the inner cities.	0
ClaimBuster	9369	I'm prepared to make them, the Vice President is not.	0
ClaimBuster	9370	A lot of people are sick and tired of the bitterness in Washington, D.C. and therefore they don't want any part of politics.	0
ClaimBuster	9371	Before I hit the ground, my cell phone rang and this trial lawyer said, I think we've got a case here.	1
ClaimBuster	9372	"Actually just going to them and saying, ""We're going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody's going to get a lower rate."""	1
ClaimBuster	9373	I'm standing here as proof that in America the possibilities are unlimited.	0
ClaimBuster	9374	As a matter of fact, he said it was not and should not be subject to partisan demagoguery because it was too important for the United States or for the world.	0
ClaimBuster	9375	However, if the insurance company doesn't follow the findings of the IRO, then that becomes a cause of action in a court of law.	0
ClaimBuster	9376	And that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad.	0
ClaimBuster	9377	But when people suggest that I pal around with terrorists, then we're not talking about issues.	0
ClaimBuster	9378	There's funds for 3,000 new schools created by teachers and parents, sometimes by business people, called charter schools that have no rules, they're free of bureaucracy and can only stay in existence if they perform and teach children.	1
ClaimBuster	9379	In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious.	0
ClaimBuster	9380	The last year I was in office uh - our budget was - was actually less than it was a year before, uh which showed a great uh improvement.	1
ClaimBuster	9381	You can quote all the numbers you want, but I'm telling you we care about our people in Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	9382	I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government.	0
ClaimBuster	9383	And I think it will happen in my lifetime.	0
ClaimBuster	9384	I think this is a test of leadership, and I think the American people know the difference.	0
ClaimBuster	9385	My mother and father, during the Depression, worked very hard to give me an opportunity to do better in our great country.	0
ClaimBuster	9386	And one of the reasons our selection of a running mate is so important, it is such a test of the kinds of standards we'll set, is because it tells the American people in advance of the election just what kind of people we're looking for.	0
ClaimBuster	9387	Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that's horrifying.	0
ClaimBuster	9388	As a matter of fact, your record is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative senator from Massachusetts.	1
ClaimBuster	9389	And I don't believe that at all I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use.	0
ClaimBuster	9390	We've wrecked the airline industry already because of all these leverage buyouts and all these terrible things that have happened to the airline industry.	1
ClaimBuster	9391	Oh, you're going to let me.	0
ClaimBuster	9392	Absolutely we've got to make sure they get educated.	0
ClaimBuster	9393	But, where are we getting the money that the Federal Government is putting out to help them?	0
ClaimBuster	9394	We have to fix our health care system, which is putting an enormous burden on families.	0
ClaimBuster	9395	Federal funding for education is up substantially -- Pell grants are up.	1
ClaimBuster	9396	The sooner the better off we'll be, if you put tougher sanctions on Castro, not try to make it easier for him.	0
ClaimBuster	9397	You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life.	0
ClaimBuster	9398	But I built a phenomenal company.	0
ClaimBuster	9399	And we have a very important decision to make.	0
ClaimBuster	9400	And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.	1
ClaimBuster	9401	When we look, for example, at the vote on the Congo.	0
ClaimBuster	9402	I don't think America's youth are interest groups, I think they're our future.	0
ClaimBuster	9403	I just care whether it works for America and whether it's going to make us stronger.	0
ClaimBuster	9404	We know where they're cutting.	0
ClaimBuster	9405	We took it out of politics.	1
ClaimBuster	9406	Secondly, Mr. Nixon has continued to state - and he stated it last week - these fantastic figures of what the Democratic budget would c- uh - platform would cost.	1
ClaimBuster	9407	The same country that's helping us try to stop the flow of drugs into our country that's killing young Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	9408	And also General Petraeus said the same thing.	1
ClaimBuster	9409	But I do make a pledge that in the next ten days when we're asking the American people to make one of the most important decisions in their lifetime, because I think this election is one of the mast vital in the history of America, that uh - we do together what we can to stimulate voter participation.	0
ClaimBuster	9410	And so if Kim Jong Il decides again to not honor an agreement, he's not only doing injustice to America, he'd be doing injustice to China, as well.	0
ClaimBuster	9411	Crime has gone down but it's because the mayors like Rudy Giuliani where one third of the drop happened in one city, New York City.	1
ClaimBuster	9412	We haven't felt so insecure that we've reached for the club of state to have our point of view.	0
ClaimBuster	9413	We are spending a lot of money to modernize our weapons system.	0
ClaimBuster	9414	They taught me that this was the greatest country in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	9415	With interest rates down and inflation down, the cruelest tax of all, caught up in a global slowdown right now, that that will change if you go with the programs I've talked about and if you help with job retraining and education.	1
ClaimBuster	9416	We hadn't caught bin Laden.	1
ClaimBuster	9417	And I think this would uh - this would be uh easy to accomplish, to get jobs down, without having strong in- inflationary pressures that - that would be necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	9418	Uh - I think it's accurate to say that the uh - strip-mining law which was passed twice by the Congress - uh - and was only like two votes I believe of being overridden - would have been good for the country.	1
ClaimBuster	9419	You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it.	1
ClaimBuster	9420	But that's not the $54 billion cost that John is talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	9421	But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart.	1
ClaimBuster	9422	Now, it's not the Republicans' fault, of course, and it's not the Democrats' fault.	0
ClaimBuster	9423	I would indict him for it.	0
ClaimBuster	9424	If the rate of increase in government spending can be held at 5 percent -- we're not far from there -- by 1989 that would have reduced the budget deficits down to a $30 or $40 billion level.	1
ClaimBuster	9425	We don't need mass armies anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	9426	Now as far as the present situation is concerned, I think it's time that we nail a few of these distortions about the United States that have been put out.	0
ClaimBuster	9427	We have worked hard for peace and freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	9428	Let me tell you what I feel.	0
ClaimBuster	9429	I can't think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country.	0
ClaimBuster	9430	It's cut federal aid to education; it's cut Pell grants and loans to close the door to college opportunity on youngsters all over this country.	1
ClaimBuster	9431	I make those charts you see on television.	1
ClaimBuster	9432	But we've also got to provide them with financial and concrete assistance to help rebuild their economies.	0
ClaimBuster	9433	We don't yet know what our tax revenues are going to be.	0
ClaimBuster	9434	So we must use all of these weapons for the purpose of combating recession if it should come.	0
ClaimBuster	9435	And it's fair, shared sacrifice to do the right thing for our country and for our children.	0
ClaimBuster	9436	That we spent -- the top 1% receive 223 as opposed to 445 billion in new spending.	1
ClaimBuster	9437	I just don't believe we ought to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	9438	America has a lot of families that are in trouble today.	0
ClaimBuster	9439	Again it's important to put the situation in perspective.	0
ClaimBuster	9440	The American people want arms control.	0
ClaimBuster	9441	And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or -- or Senator Wyden, who's the co-author of the bill with -- with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill -- Bill Clinton's chief of staff.	1
ClaimBuster	9442	What I ask is this.	0
ClaimBuster	9443	Bill and I have been involved in trying to help Haiti for many years.	1
ClaimBuster	9444	And are they good for our national security?	0
ClaimBuster	9445	I think we have lost credibility, and I say this very honestly without any partisanship.	0
ClaimBuster	9446	I have no disagreement with the Vice President's position on that.	0
ClaimBuster	9447	But it starts with working in a collaborative effort with states and local folks.	1
ClaimBuster	9448	In our administration, in my administration, we will expedite.	0
ClaimBuster	9449	And terrorist acts are such that our own United States Capitol in Washington has been bombed twice.	1
ClaimBuster	9450	And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	9451	2nd thing, there are not many times in your life when you get to talk to a whole country.	0
ClaimBuster	9452	You know a major difference in this campaign is that Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making.	0
ClaimBuster	9453	But again it's almost like an ad hoc foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	9454	And I believe that we will be able to get a fix that has alluded everybody else because we know how to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	9455	There've been more disputes in its area where there's more volatility than any other place in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	9456	There is no question that we face this massive deficit, and almost everybody agrees unless we get it down, the chances for long-term, healthy growth are nil.	0
ClaimBuster	9457	What's a question I think the -- the president will have a chance to answer right now.	0
ClaimBuster	9458	And it would involve a religious test for the first time in American life.	1
ClaimBuster	9459	That's not what I do as president, that's not what I do as Commander in Chief.	0
ClaimBuster	9460	And it hasn't been finished at all.	1
ClaimBuster	9461	I don't think most people do.	0
ClaimBuster	9462	When I took aver we had uh a bureaucratic mess, like we have in Washington now, and we had three hundred agencies, departments, bureaus, commissions - uh some uh - fully budgeted, some not, but all having responsibility to carry out that was in conflict.	1
ClaimBuster	9463	If they're space weapons, I assume they'll be in space.	0
ClaimBuster	9464	If I'm poor and you're rich, and I can get you to defend me, that's good.	0
ClaimBuster	9465	Well, Mr. Nixon uh- I'll just give you the testimony of Mr. George Aiken - Senator George Aiken, the ranking minority member - Republican member - and former chairman of the Senate Agricultural Committee testifying in 1959 - said there were twenty-six million Americans who did not have the income to afford a decent diet.	1
ClaimBuster	9466	I think science is real.	0
ClaimBuster	9467	But, look, Cindy and I are adoptive parents.	1
ClaimBuster	9468	I know what it takes to create good jobs again.	0
ClaimBuster	9469	But there's still a problem, because what happens is, those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors.	0
ClaimBuster	9470	And I strongly believe we need to keep a presence in NATO, but I'm going to be judicious as to how to use the military.	0
ClaimBuster	9471	A jury found them guilty.	1
ClaimBuster	9472	It's expressed itself in the desire of the people of Africa to be independent of Western Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	9473	I talk about strengthening the American family and it's very hard to strengthen the family if people are scared to walk down to the corner store and, you know, send their kid down to get a loaf of bread.	0
ClaimBuster	9474	And here I do have, on this particular question, a big difference with my opponent.	0
ClaimBuster	9475	A lot of folks on Medicare are out there every day making the choice between food and medicine; not poor enough for Medicare-Medicaid, not wealthy enough to buy their medicine.	1
ClaimBuster	9476	Robert Rubin looked at his plan and said it won't work.	1
ClaimBuster	9477	Remember, it's your money; it's not his money.	0
ClaimBuster	9478	Now, it is true, though, that I believe that we should have direct talks -- not just with our friends, but also with our enemies -- to deliver a tough, direct message to Iran that, if you don't change your behavior, then there will be dire consequences.	0
ClaimBuster	9479	But here's the problem: If we are giving them to oil companies, then that means that there are those who are not going to be getting them.	0
ClaimBuster	9480	I agree that we cannot commit ground forces to become involved in the quagmire of Bosnia or in the tribal wars of Somalia.	0
ClaimBuster	9481	I would like to see eventually in this country some form of universal health care, but I'm not for a government-run system.	0
ClaimBuster	9482	I said we'd get tougher with child support and child support enforcement's up 50 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	9483	And uh - I don't believe that our security would be directly threatened if the Soviet Union went uh - into Yugoslavia.	0
ClaimBuster	9484	We need the things in it that coordinate the FBI and the CIA.	0
ClaimBuster	9485	Many would trade for it.	0
ClaimBuster	9486	I didn't need anybody to tell me to go to the United Nations.	0
ClaimBuster	9487	The Governor may not have heard my uh - established criteria for the selection of a vice president, but uh - it was a well-established criteria that the person I selected would be fully qualified to be president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	9488	But, you know, if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why that $2.8 billion is on the table.	0
ClaimBuster	9489	They only added a little bit back this year because it's an election year.	1
ClaimBuster	9490	I live in a state where over half the adults have hunting or fishing licenses, or both.	1
ClaimBuster	9491	We are better off than we were four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	9492	What happens -- the money goes to them.	0
ClaimBuster	9493	And we've got to make sure that we reduce our deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	9494	We cannot afford stoppages of massive effect on the economy when we're in the terrible competition we're in with the Soviets.	0
ClaimBuster	9495	Those words, I've been hearing them for many years.	1
ClaimBuster	9496	Senator Obama twice said in debates he would sit down with Ahmadinejad, Chavez and Raul Castro without precondition.	1
ClaimBuster	9497	In other words, I have seen his program costed out to the point where it would amount to more than $300 million a year, just for the military.	1
ClaimBuster	9498	And what's happened in the meantime?	0
ClaimBuster	9499	It requires an aggressive searching out and reaching out to help people who especially need it.	0
ClaimBuster	9500	John Edwards and I support tort reform.	1
ClaimBuster	9501	But, number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan.	1
ClaimBuster	9502	He'd been in Afghanistan, went to Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	9503	We have also provided in our program for a $4 billion Community Trust Fund, and we've told you where the money is coming from.	1
ClaimBuster	9504	And I'll tell you exactly how.	0
ClaimBuster	9505	Well, John, I'm a man that's been a chief executive for ten years.	1
ClaimBuster	9506	You can't bring back jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	9507	Now that's not a flip-flop.	0
ClaimBuster	9508	That story reported several times that I would lower taxes for low and middle-income families and uh - that correction was delivered to the White House and I am sure that the president knows about this uh - correction, but he still insists uh - on repeating an erroneous statement.	1
ClaimBuster	9509	But we can and must move faster, and that's why I stand so strongly for programs that will move America forward in the sixties, move her forward so that we can stay ahead of the Soviet Union and win the battle for freedom and peace.	0
ClaimBuster	9510	"A year ago he said, ""I was right then."	1
ClaimBuster	9511	I'm going to help women in America get good work by getting a stronger economy and by supporting women in the workforce.	0
ClaimBuster	9512	My faith affects everything that I do, in truth.	0
ClaimBuster	9513	And the principles that we put in place, we also gave kids not just a graduation exam that determined whether they were up to the skills needed to -- to be able compete, but also if they graduated the quarter of their class, they got a four-year tuition- free ride at any Massachusetts public institution of higher learning.	1
ClaimBuster	9514	With all this instability and breaking into republics, and all the Middle Eastern countries going over there and shopping for weapons, we've got our work cut out for us.	1
ClaimBuster	9515	And I want them to be proud of their vote in the years ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	9516	These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.	1
ClaimBuster	9517	The President of the United States has indicated they are not within the treaty area.	1
ClaimBuster	9518	And what I want to do is continue the tax rates -- the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families.	0
ClaimBuster	9519	You said that on occasion America had dictated to other nations.	1
ClaimBuster	9520	The American people are seeing it, and I'm proud of it; that's what I'd say.	0
ClaimBuster	9521	But I don't think that the state, the Board of Regents, a Board of Education, or any state official, should try to compose that prayer for a child to recite.	0
ClaimBuster	9522	I know -- I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	9523	And for them to be able to provide nuclear technology to non-state actors, that's unacceptable.	0
ClaimBuster	9524	We will take a look.	0
ClaimBuster	9525	And just look at other countries that have tried to have federally controlled health care.	0
ClaimBuster	9526	The Soviet Union is no more and we're working with a democratic country.	1
ClaimBuster	9527	Tonight in the audience there's one elected state senator who is a Democrat, a former state-wide officer who is a Democrat, a lot of Democrats who are here in the debate to -- because they want to show their support that shows I know how to lead.	1
ClaimBuster	9528	Does that make you feel safer in America?	0
ClaimBuster	9529	But I do believe we have to help our people get ready to succeed in the 21st Century.	0
ClaimBuster	9530	He did block it, because we passed it in the United States Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	9531	In other words, if the United States is going to maintain its strength and its prestige, we must not only be strong militarily and economically, we must be firm diplomatically.	0
ClaimBuster	9532	And let me step back and tell you what I would like to do with our immigration policy broadly and include an answer to your question.	0
ClaimBuster	9533	And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.	1
ClaimBuster	9534	Since we debated 2 weeks ago, the United States and the Soviet Union have built a hundred more warheads, enough to kill millions of Americans and millions of Soviet citizens.	1
ClaimBuster	9535	I'm not sure where he's coming from.	0
ClaimBuster	9536	He was a good neighbor in Latin America because he was a good neighbor in the United States; because they saw us as a society that was compassionate, that cared about people, that was moving this country ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	9537	And so, my change had come earlier than that.	1
ClaimBuster	9538	They didn't view their service as a back-door draft.	1
ClaimBuster	9539	"Governor Romney, I genuinely believe cares about education, but when he tells a student that, you know, ""you should borrow money from your parents to go to college,"" you know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver, just don't have that option."	1
ClaimBuster	9540	It is the Bush administration that has had no new jobs in the private sector in the last 4 years.	1
ClaimBuster	9541	And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	9542	With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, it's a problem of the Constitution.	0
ClaimBuster	9543	And every defense expert I know, including people in the Pentagon itself, will tell you that given the level of defense spending and the level of defense appropriations which the Congress has now approved and the president has signed, there's no way that you can do all of these things and do them well.	0
ClaimBuster	9544	So you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal?	0
ClaimBuster	9545	Who's the best person to manage money?	0
ClaimBuster	9546	I don't think you can deny that.	0
ClaimBuster	9547	He is an indicted war criminal.	1
ClaimBuster	9548	Don't we go across state lines when we purchase other things in America?	0
ClaimBuster	9549	The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	9550	That's the access I believe is necessary, is to make sure every child learns to read, write, add and subtract early, to be able to build on that education by going to college so they can start their careers with a college diploma.	0
ClaimBuster	9551	And it is a fact that through most of these last twenty-five years the Republican leadership has opposed federal aid for education, medical care for the aged, development of the Tennessee Valley, development of our natural resources.	1
ClaimBuster	9552	I thank you for that.	0
ClaimBuster	9553	I'll keep you in suspense.	0
ClaimBuster	9554	I don't think that means you're soft on drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	9555	I think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	9556	You've got to read what he said...	0
ClaimBuster	9557	And so I've told him my opinion.	1
ClaimBuster	9558	I don't have a one of them, and I haven't taken a penny of foreign money, and I never will.	1
ClaimBuster	9559	That's the question before the American people, and only you can decide what you want, what you want this country to be, what you want to do with the future.	0
ClaimBuster	9560	I proposed, as you know, a reduction to increase the personal exemption from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	9561	Now, as a result of our taking the strong stand that we did, the civil war there was ended; and today, at least in the south of Indochina, the Communists have moved out and we do have a strong, free bastion there.	1
ClaimBuster	9562	It's a great question about Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	9563	I believe in the need for increased oil production.	0
ClaimBuster	9564	But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO?	1
ClaimBuster	9565	Four Democrats voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	9566	And certainty sometimes can get you in trouble.	0
ClaimBuster	9567	So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I'd say absolutely not.	0
ClaimBuster	9568	First of all, Russia I indicated is a geopolitical foe.	1
ClaimBuster	9569	We came into office and the Social Security Trust Fund was in great jeopardy and the President took the leadership working with the Democrats and the Republicans in Congress some tough calls were made and the Social Security Trust Fund was put back into sound, solvent condition.	1
ClaimBuster	9570	How do you make them bring the jobs back?	0
ClaimBuster	9571	You don't have anywhere to sleep.	0
ClaimBuster	9572	"We're shipping the quote, ""low paying jobs"" overseas."	0
ClaimBuster	9573	I'm -- I'm -- I'm happy.	0
ClaimBuster	9574	I believe that this country is electing more and more African Americans and Latinos and Asian Americans who are representing districts that are themselves not necessarily of a majority of their race.	0
ClaimBuster	9575	I believe that since I've been in office, there have been six or eight areas of combat evolved in other parts of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	9576	I know what it means to have a commitment to diversity.	0
ClaimBuster	9577	This one must be stepped up.	0
ClaimBuster	9578	You look at how we get to a balanced budget within eight to 10 years.	0
ClaimBuster	9579	No attack ever created a job or educated a child, or helped a family make ends meet.	0
ClaimBuster	9580	Two questions: How do you deter nuclear attack without modernizing our nuclear forces when the Soviets are modernizing and how come you spend-willing to spend a dime on something that you consider a fantasy and a fraud.	0
ClaimBuster	9581	I say the programs and the leadership that failed then is not the program and the leadership that America needs now.	0
ClaimBuster	9582	But in this case it was a nation-building exercise, and same with Haiti.	1
ClaimBuster	9583	It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment.	1
ClaimBuster	9584	On the question of the summit, I agree with the position of Mr. Nixon.	0
ClaimBuster	9585	All the people I've met who used to be on welfare who are now working and raising their children.	0
ClaimBuster	9586	There are so many things there, I don't quite know where to begin.	0
ClaimBuster	9587	You can also deduct long-term care now, so it's a good it's a good start.	0
ClaimBuster	9588	I want everybody who pays taxes to have their tax rates cut.	0
ClaimBuster	9589	I don't trust the Russians.	0
ClaimBuster	9590	That's got to be changed.	0
ClaimBuster	9591	-- we're taking advantage of our energy resources.	0
ClaimBuster	9592	And this is an example of where we are going to have to prioritize.	0
ClaimBuster	9593	I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should.	0
ClaimBuster	9594	Well, that's exactly the commitment that was made to the American people in 1980: He would never reduce benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	9595	I have -- I understand everybody in this country doesn't agree with the decisions I've made.	1
ClaimBuster	9596	We can close an achievement gap, and it starts with making sure we have strong accountability, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	9597	The other thing we have to do to save Medicare?	0
ClaimBuster	9598	Thank you very much, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	9599	And so, we have set a standard that those loans and those grants are directed to the people who otherwise could not go to college, their family incomes were so low.	0
ClaimBuster	9600	And we need to be very clear about that.	0
ClaimBuster	9601	Gene, there is a problem in the sense that there are some problem banks, and on December 19th new regulations will go into effect which will in effect give the government the responsibility to close some banks that are not technically insolvent but that are plainly in trouble.	1
ClaimBuster	9602	I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know where the vice president stands but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a renewable energy source of energy.	0
ClaimBuster	9603	Iran went from zero centrifuges to develop nuclear weapons to 4,000.	1
ClaimBuster	9604	They were eventually saying, Mexican jobs will eventually come to $7.50 an hour, ours will eventually go down to $7.50 an hour.	1
ClaimBuster	9605	I do believe, however, that we can give to the president of the United States powers, in addition to what he presently has in the fact finding area, which would enable him to be more effective than we have been in handling these strikes.	0
ClaimBuster	9606	But maybe you ought to travel down there and visit them and maybe you could understand it a lot better.	0
ClaimBuster	9607	So, what I'm saying is, we are going to have to make choices.	0
ClaimBuster	9608	Lester, one thing I'd like to say.	0
ClaimBuster	9609	I would not ho- hand over these islands under any point of gun.	0
ClaimBuster	9610	Let's think it through here.	0
ClaimBuster	9611	Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life.	0
ClaimBuster	9612	We reformed our school system, and now there's an achievement gap in America that's beginning to close.	0
ClaimBuster	9613	But take a look at the Democratic convention take a look at it.	0
ClaimBuster	9614	This is the only one country he's ever known.	1
ClaimBuster	9615	Look, we, no matter what, we've got to cut spending.	0
ClaimBuster	9616	I will keep this nation strong.	0
ClaimBuster	9617	Because I'm offsetting some of the reductions with holding down some of the deductions.	0
ClaimBuster	9618	I believe the president made a huge mistake, a catastrophic mistake, not to live up to his own standard, which was: build a true global coalition, give the inspectors time to finish their job and go through the U.N. process to its end and go to war as a last resort.	1
ClaimBuster	9619	We spent a lot of money to make sure people get health care in the State of Texas, and we're doing a better job than they are at the national level for reducing uninsured.	1
ClaimBuster	9620	We ought to insist on access.	0
ClaimBuster	9621	That's a -- that's -- go to the -- please, fact checkers, get to work.	0
ClaimBuster	9622	But let me remind you, my family has suffered from drug abuse.	1
ClaimBuster	9623	We don't give away our hand before we sit down at the head table.	0
ClaimBuster	9624	They were public employment that these people who really want to get out into the private job market where there are jobs with a future.	0
ClaimBuster	9625	It is going to require a new spirit.	0
ClaimBuster	9626	Also, recently, when someone suggested that the Occupational Safety and Health Act should be abolished, Governor Reagan responded, amen.	0
ClaimBuster	9627	That's -- that's a big topic.	0
ClaimBuster	9628	Let me tell you another place to look for some savings.	0
ClaimBuster	9629	This isn't a question of a little charity for the homeless.	0
ClaimBuster	9630	They can't have an election right now.	0
ClaimBuster	9631	The rate of inflation, as announced just the other day, is under 5 percent; and the uh - 4.4 percent that was indicated at the time of the 4 percent GNP was less than the 5.4 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	9632	And every fact checker and every reporter who's looked at it, Governor, has said this is not true.	1
ClaimBuster	9633	I don't think he was misleading when he said that it was right to disarm Iraq in the spring of 2003.	0
ClaimBuster	9634	Secretary of State Colin Powell told this president the Pottery Barn rule: If you break it, you fix it.	1
ClaimBuster	9635	On this, as on so many other issues, I have a fundamental difference from the present administration.	1
ClaimBuster	9636	The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that I signed will make it possible for 25 million people to keep their health insurance when they change jobs or when somebody in their family's been sick.	1
ClaimBuster	9637	The candidate who was a candidate for the president of Brazil, took a trip to Cuba to call on Mr. Castro during the election in order to get the benefit of the Castro supporters uh - within Brazil.	1
ClaimBuster	9638	But we don't have to have - growth in spending that will blow the lid off and add to the problems of inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	9639	I doubt if they'll give me the chance, but I will drop everything and go work on it.	0
ClaimBuster	9640	I've served as the Governor of Georgia and have traveled extensively in foreign countries and South America, Central America, Europe, the Middle East and in Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	9641	And in Crawford, Texas, Jiang Zemin and I agreed that the nuclear-weapons-free peninsula, Korean Peninsula, was in his interest and our interest and the world's interest.	1
ClaimBuster	9642	It penalizes the family farmer.	1
ClaimBuster	9643	We've already 75 percent of his people.	1
ClaimBuster	9644	Let's go to the center of the bull's-eye, the core problem.	0
ClaimBuster	9645	I don't think we can do that for a few years.	0
ClaimBuster	9646	We've got communities in this country increasingly where our own kids can't afford to live in the communities that they grew up in.	0
ClaimBuster	9647	I would just like to s- add this one point.	0
ClaimBuster	9648	I want to see control of some of these projects, and I want to keep the interest rates down.	0
ClaimBuster	9649	If you raise the Medicaid to 300 percent, it provides an incentive for small businesses not to provide private insurance to their employees.	1
ClaimBuster	9650	I want to have the military keeping the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	9651	The secretary of state has appeared in the several years that he's been the secretary before eighty different uh - committee hearings in the House and in the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	9652	Too many people have been left behind.	0
ClaimBuster	9653	Well, I'm reluctant to uh comment on the recent report - I haven't read it.	0
ClaimBuster	9654	Our values must be at stake.	0
ClaimBuster	9655	I'm the first governor to clean it up.	1
ClaimBuster	9656	That's after losing 5 million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	9657	Well, is a homebuyer better off he can refinance the home, because interest rates are down?	0
ClaimBuster	9658	As a matter of fact, my opponent talks about inspectors.	1
ClaimBuster	9659	Now, here is the good news, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	9660	It's pretty clear you won't admit...	0
ClaimBuster	9661	We have low interest rates today.	1
ClaimBuster	9662	They're going to come rushing back in to Afghanistan when we go.	0
ClaimBuster	9663	I happen to believe, I want the kids that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or Title I -- these are disabled kids or -- or -- or poor kids or -- or lower-income kids, rather, I want them to be able to go to the school of their choice.	0
ClaimBuster	9664	And that's what they are.	0
ClaimBuster	9665	And I have done a lot...	1
ClaimBuster	9666	Now, we all know that we've got to do more.	0
ClaimBuster	9667	So I think step one to make sure prescription drugs is more affordable for seniors, and those are the folks who really rely upon prescription drugs a lot these days, is to reform the Medicare system, is to have prescription drugs as an integral part of Medicare once and for all.	0
ClaimBuster	9668	It not only liberated - uh black people but it also liberated the whites.	0
ClaimBuster	9669	If we assume the ah - uh - a rate of growth of our economy, equivalent to what it was during President Johnson, President Kennedy, even before the - the - the - uh wa uh - Vietnese- namese War, and if we assume that at the end of the four-year period we can cut our unemployment rate down to 4 to 4 and a half percent - under those circumstances, even assuming no elimination of unnecessary programs and assuming an increase in the ad- in the allotment of money to finance programs, increasing as the inflation rate does - my economic projections, I think confirmed by the House uh - and the Senate committees, have been with the $60 billion extra amount of money that can be spent in fiscal year '81 which will be the last year of this next term.	1
ClaimBuster	9670	He lost the Iowa caucus.	1
ClaimBuster	9671	IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got to protect them.	0
ClaimBuster	9672	Let's stop, you know, playing the political game, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	9673	I'd be happy to have you take a look.	0
ClaimBuster	9674	The president made the judgment to divert forces from under General Tommy Franks from Afghanistan before the Congress even approved it to begin to prepare to go to war in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	9675	I believe the vice president was in charge of deregulation.	0
ClaimBuster	9676	Look, we've got the biggest surpluses in all of American history.	1
ClaimBuster	9677	Emphasize and subsidize modernizing plant and equipment here, not moving plants overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	9678	After the election, he'll get more backbone.	0
ClaimBuster	9679	We must have China's leverage on Kim Jong Il, besides ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	9680	That's what drug it out.	0
ClaimBuster	9681	And I have a plan that will take the catastrophic cases out of the system, off your backs, pay for it out of a federal fund, which lowers the premiums for everybody in America, makes American business more competitive and makes health care more affordable.	0
ClaimBuster	9682	"You know when members of the Republican Congress say, ""We're going to sign a no tax pledge, so that we don't ask a dime for millionaires and billionaires to reduce our deficit so we can still invest in education, and helping kids go to college."	0
ClaimBuster	9683	There should be no tests in the atmosphere; that rules out any fall-out.	0
ClaimBuster	9684	But let's take my life in perspective.	0
ClaimBuster	9685	The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2,000 -- 2,000 -- look at them, my friends.	0
ClaimBuster	9686	Now one of the reasons I was able to get so many good women to be part of that team was because of our recruiting effort.	0
ClaimBuster	9687	There will always be problems in this whole world.	0
ClaimBuster	9688	So let me -- let me just talk about this fundamental difference.	0
ClaimBuster	9689	[Applause] I propose a budget -- I have proposed a budget which would increase our nation's strength, in real terms, by double that of the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	9690	While they didn't talk at all, the fuel rods came out, the inspectors were kicked out, the television cameras were kicked out.	1
ClaimBuster	9691	"What it means is that we don't do what we've been doing, which is to say, ""Until you agree to do exactly what we say, we won't have direct contacts with you."""	0
ClaimBuster	9692	I believe it was a failure of presidential leadership not to reauthorize the assault weapons ban.	0
ClaimBuster	9693	And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down.	0
ClaimBuster	9694	I want to be able to tell my grandson when I'm in my later years that I didn't turn away from the evidence that showed that we were doing some serious harm.	0
ClaimBuster	9695	Admirals Spruance and Callins in 1955 said that we should not attempt to defend these islands, in their conference in the Far East.	1
ClaimBuster	9696	WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re the best and the most efficient farmers.	0
ClaimBuster	9697	I want the families to make decisions between themselves and their doctors.	0
ClaimBuster	9698	I have a record of reform, and taking on my party, the other party, the special interests, whether it be an HMO Patients' Bill of Rights, or trying to clean up the campaign finance system in -- in this country, or whether it be establishment of a 9/11 Commission, I have a long record of it.	1
ClaimBuster	9699	They don't go to war with each other.	0
ClaimBuster	9700	Today we import one million barrels from Saddam Hussein.	1
ClaimBuster	9701	So for me, I look at this as both a need to help move Pakistan in the right direction, and also to get Afghanistan to be ready, and they will be ready by the end of 2014.	0
ClaimBuster	9702	It hurts communities, because these are our first responders.	0
ClaimBuster	9703	It puts a heavy burden on a states like California.	1
ClaimBuster	9704	"And we said, ""Why not cut out the middleman?"""	0
ClaimBuster	9705	Well, here again, uh - the Panamanian question is one that's been confused by Mr. Ford.	0
ClaimBuster	9706	Mr. President, America has not dictated to other nations.	0
ClaimBuster	9707	I make no allegations about that.	0
ClaimBuster	9708	He wants to grow the government and I trust you with your own money.	0
ClaimBuster	9709	It's just clear you can go to the website and look.	0
ClaimBuster	9710	I agree with the president: when they couldn't, we should have; now that they can, they should.	0
ClaimBuster	9711	We can do it by giving them, as a start, a $5,000 refundable tax credit to go around and get the health insurance policy of their choice.	0
ClaimBuster	9712	That's not what I'm going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	9713	As well, we included South Korea, Japan and Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	9714	I think it may be necessary that we have more taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	9715	The ambassador of the United Nations went on the Sunday television shows and spoke about how --	1
ClaimBuster	9716	President Carter also has spoken of the new jobs created.	1
ClaimBuster	9717	I think it's important to foster competition inside the public schools.	0
ClaimBuster	9718	... including $3 million for an overhead projector in a planetarium in his hometown.	1
ClaimBuster	9719	And it has not been easy.	0
ClaimBuster	9720	It's going to come from the dedication, by 1984, of the excise revenues that today are being collected by the Federal Government on alcohol and tobacco.	0
ClaimBuster	9721	We've been cleaning it up for four years.	1
ClaimBuster	9722	Parents now feel like you have to compete with the mass culture in order to raise your kids with the values that you want them to have.	0
ClaimBuster	9723	But if we remain strong and resolute, we will defeat this enemy.	0
ClaimBuster	9724	Nobody would have dreamed it possible.	0
ClaimBuster	9725	... and it's a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it.	1
ClaimBuster	9726	And that's why the biggest risk we could take right now is to adopt the same failed policies and the same failed politics that we've seen over the last eight years and somehow expect a different result.	0
ClaimBuster	9727	Mr. Perot will tell you, for example, that the expert he hired to analyze his plan says that it will bring the deficit down in 5 years but it will make unemployment bad for 4 more years.	1
ClaimBuster	9728	I don't mind releasing -- I'm under a routine audit.	1
ClaimBuster	9729	Over 50 percent - 53 to be exact - percent of the tax benefits go to the 14 percent richest people in this country, and we've had a 50 percent increase in payroll deductions since Mr. Nixon went in office eight years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	9730	I don't want to go back to the Carter grain embargo on the Soviets.	0
ClaimBuster	9731	And yes, farmers are the first environmentalists.	0
ClaimBuster	9732	And we will be better off, far better off, if we stop right now, because we have more to lose in space then they do.	0
ClaimBuster	9733	Eh- He was talking about the Castro regime and what we had been eh- doing in Latin America.	1
ClaimBuster	9734	You can't expect to build an alliance when you denigrate the contributions of those who are serving side by side with American troops in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	9735	Now, that's not in my gut.	0
ClaimBuster	9736	I can only tell you that I don't think Senator Dole is too old to be president.	0
ClaimBuster	9737	There's enough money to pay seniors today in the current affairs of Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	9738	And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material.	0
ClaimBuster	9739	That's the good news, my friends.	0
ClaimBuster	9740	You weren't impressed with the fact that he --	0
ClaimBuster	9741	One of the uh - most embarrassing uh - failures of the Ford administration, and one that touches specifically on human rights, is his refusal to appoint a presidential commission to go to Vietnam, to go to Laos, to go to Cambodia and try to trade for the release of information about those who are missing in action in those wars.	1
ClaimBuster	9742	But Saddam Hussein was a unique threat.	0
ClaimBuster	9743	Well, I think they're serious.	0
ClaimBuster	9744	I don't think you have to -- shouldn't have to hire a lawyer to figure out how to get into this country legally.	0
ClaimBuster	9745	And yet, in the last nine months of this year, we've had a drop in our economic growth rather than a gain.	1
ClaimBuster	9746	Well, Mr. Nixon, to go back to 1955.	0
ClaimBuster	9747	The American people want their children educated.	0
ClaimBuster	9748	I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together.	0
ClaimBuster	9749	Thank you very, very much.	0
ClaimBuster	9750	Now, I've proposed adding two active-duty divisions to the armed forces of the United States -- one combat, one support.	1
ClaimBuster	9751	If he gets elected president, we'll start the new century without anyone in the cabinet of the President representing education in our children.	0
ClaimBuster	9752	"General Shinseki had the wisdom to say, ""You're going to need several hundred thousand troops to win the peace."""	1
ClaimBuster	9753	The living Americans today have fought harder, paid a higher price for freedom, and done more to advance the dignity of man than any people who ever lived on this earth.	0
ClaimBuster	9754	And we've got to do a lot of work in Africa to promote democracy and trade, and there are some -- Vice President mentioned Nigeria is a fledgling democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	9755	I don't know how you draw that line.	0
ClaimBuster	9756	But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.	1
ClaimBuster	9757	But it didn't mean that.	0
ClaimBuster	9758	And Senator Bob Dole is so qualified: sixteen years in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, uhh - very high responsibilities on important committees.	1
ClaimBuster	9759	Of the nine million people put to work in new jobs since I've been in office, 1.3 million of those has been among black Americans, and another million among those who speak Spanish.	1
ClaimBuster	9760	Trillion-dollar deficits for the last four years.	1
ClaimBuster	9761	This is a time -- this should have been a time for American leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	9762	His influence is strong enough today to prevent us from joi- getting the other countries of Latin America to join with us in economic quarantine.	0
ClaimBuster	9763	Well, many of the provisions in the Kassebaum bill were provisions that -- my provisions, like deductions for long-term care, making certain that self-employed people that are watching tonight can deduct not 30 percent but 80 percent of you pay for premiums.	1
ClaimBuster	9764	I've learned from them that people do have tough times.	1
ClaimBuster	9765	We're helping youngsters; we're reaching out to them.	0
ClaimBuster	9766	That's its most basic function.	0
ClaimBuster	9767	I know this to be a fact because I had one tell me last week, Senator don't cut my Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	9768	It's up to the people in this region to take control of their country.	0
ClaimBuster	9769	And - and the whole uh subject of crime is one that concerns our people very much, and I believe that the fairness of it is - is what - uh - is a - is a major problem that addresses our - our leader and this is something that hasn't been addressed adequately by - by this administration.	0
ClaimBuster	9770	But I know, as I think you do, that our country is strongest when we lead the world, when we lead strong alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	9771	And that's what I intend to do as president.	0
ClaimBuster	9772	Do you know who J. Danforth was, he was a man who gave his life in World War II, so ridiculing a person's name is a little beneath this process.	1
ClaimBuster	9773	It's very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go uncollected.	0
ClaimBuster	9774	And I just had to work that in.	0
ClaimBuster	9775	The way you get a better America is to balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment; to give a targeted tax cut -- and let me talk about the education tax cut -- to let people have a $10,000 deduction for the cost of college tuition in any year, any kind of college tuition; to give families a tax credit, a dollar for dollar reduction in their taxes for the cost of a typical community college so we can open that to everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	9776	But it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done.	0
ClaimBuster	9777	But if you can check up on them, that's real power.	0
ClaimBuster	9778	When I came into office, we were still bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan had been drifting for a decade.	1
ClaimBuster	9779	But I think the feeling is misplaced.	0
ClaimBuster	9780	If you're going to die, you don't have to go through this ten-year cycle that FDA goes through on new drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	9781	And yet my faith and confidence in the American future is undiminished.	0
ClaimBuster	9782	I think he made my case.	0
ClaimBuster	9783	All that I can say is this: we do have programs in all of these fields - education, housing, defense - that will move America forward.	0
ClaimBuster	9784	I mean, I -- because I think whoever is the president must guard your liberties, must not erode your rights in America.	0
ClaimBuster	9785	I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	9786	First of all, the people of my state have let me be their governor for 12 years because I made commitments to 2 things -- more jobs and better schools.	1
ClaimBuster	9787	We ought to be a beacon for nations who search for peace and who search for freedom, who search for individual liberty, who search for basic human rights.	0
ClaimBuster	9788	What I want the President to do, and I think he may have done it, his last statement, call for an unconditional end of the violence and have the parties keep on talking as they should talk and have a resolution.	0
ClaimBuster	9789	Now, we need a tight budget, but there's no question that this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life, and they're hurting.	0
ClaimBuster	9790	Well, just briefly, I - I think this is uh - the second time that General Brown has made a statement that - for which he did have to apologize.	1
ClaimBuster	9791	Who fought against wasteful and earmark spending?	0
ClaimBuster	9792	Number two, I will not reduce the share paid by high-income individuals.	0
ClaimBuster	9793	You know, four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	9794	Whatever is brought in, I think that we can finance essential programs within a balanced budget, if business remains orderly.	0
ClaimBuster	9795	So why aren't you putting money into your own campaign?	0
ClaimBuster	9796	And he was down there fighting against imperialism.	1
ClaimBuster	9797	As I uh - related a moment ago, the President has always indicated that we must not make the mistake in dealing with the dictator of indicating that we are going to make a concession at the point of a gun.	1
ClaimBuster	9798	We're no longer respected in a showdown vote in the United Nations or in - in any other international council we're lucky to get 20 percent of the other nations to vote with us.	1
ClaimBuster	9799	Most small businesses are Subchapter S corps.	1
ClaimBuster	9800	The all- time low in our country was the Judge Thomas-Anita Hill hearings, and those senators ought to be hanging their heads in shame for what they did there.	0
ClaimBuster	9801	First of all, he's wrong in thinking th- er- even suggesting that Mr. Khrushchev might have continued the conference if we had expressed regrets.	0
ClaimBuster	9802	And it's important for them.	0
ClaimBuster	9803	Let's look at the vote on the Congo, the vote was seventy to nothing against the Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	9804	There has been five or six of them and if you wait long enough, there will probably be another one.	1
ClaimBuster	9805	But in the process of that we have saved uhh - $9 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	9806	Senator Obama likes to talk loudly.	0
ClaimBuster	9807	And we will take care of Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	9808	"And I only hope that, should I win this election, that I could approach President Eisenhower in maintaining the dignity of the office; in seeing to it that whenever any mother or father talks to his child, he can look at the man in the White House and, whatever he may think of his policies, he will say: ""Well, there is a man who maintains the kind of standards personally that I would want my child to follow."""	0
ClaimBuster	9809	Let's get back to Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	9810	I'm sorry, you actually -- there was a -- there was an effort on the part of the president to have a status of forces agreement, and I concurred in that, and said that we should have some number of troops that stayed on.	1
ClaimBuster	9811	Secondly, the relations between Russia and China.	0
ClaimBuster	9812	First of all, there are two different things.	0
ClaimBuster	9813	Like Mr. Perot, I am concerned about the deficits and $150 billion is a lot of money, but it's awful hard to say we're going to go out and spend more money when we're trying to get the deficit down.	0
ClaimBuster	9814	And it's the right cause.	0
ClaimBuster	9815	When Guinea became independent, the Soviet Ambassador showed up that very day.	1
ClaimBuster	9816	Now, looking at the other parts of the world - South America - talking about our record and the previous one.	0
ClaimBuster	9817	Now, Japanese couldn't unload the cars in this country if they had the same restrictions we had, and on and on and on and on and on.	1
ClaimBuster	9818	In fact, some T-shirts that are very...	0
ClaimBuster	9819	As soon as I became president, I initiated a meeting with the NATO heads of state and met with them in Brussels to discuss how we could improve the re- defense relationship in Western Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	9820	So I think we are going to have to change and strengthen the pension requirements on private retirement plans.	0
ClaimBuster	9821	That can't -- that can't be left to stand.	0
ClaimBuster	9822	And that issue, very simply stated, is this: how can we keep the peace - keep it without surrender?	0
ClaimBuster	9823	Some kid who feels like -- doesn't matter where the gun comes from, it could be a cheap gun, expensive gun.	0
ClaimBuster	9824	We had to make cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	9825	That this was an act of terror and I also said that we're going to hunt down those who committed this crime.	1
ClaimBuster	9826	This is not research, Mr President, these are the government investing in companies.	1
ClaimBuster	9827	And -- and what's at stake here is one of two things, either Candy -- this blows up the deficit because keep in mind, this is just to pay for the additional spending that he's talking about, $7 trillion - $8 trillion before we even get to the deficit we already have.	1
ClaimBuster	9828	But let me tell you specifically what my plan does.	0
ClaimBuster	9829	And we have proven, I think very conclusively, that you can reduce the rate of inflation and increase jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	9830	That's what reporters called it.	1
ClaimBuster	9831	Or whether it be Nixon's trip to China, which was preceded by Henry Kissinger, many times before he went.	1
ClaimBuster	9832	Four years ago you took me on faith.	1
ClaimBuster	9833	And crippling sanctions are something I called for five years ago, when I was in Israel, speaking at the Herzliya Conference.	1
ClaimBuster	9834	And, you know, I just want everybody to go Google it.	0
ClaimBuster	9835	But, I've learned in this last three and a half years that when an issue is extremely difficult, when the call is very close, the chances are the experts will be divided almost 50-50.	0
ClaimBuster	9836	We've also seen a very serious uh - problem with the so-called Sonnenfeldt document, which apparently Mr. Ford has just endorsed, which said that there's an organic linkage between the Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	9837	Where every eight-year-old can read.	0
ClaimBuster	9838	Let's take all these four years in a row.	0
ClaimBuster	9839	That costs the government $7,700 per family.	1
ClaimBuster	9840	I am sure that that will not happen.	0
ClaimBuster	9841	I signed a bill that puts CHIPS in place.	1
ClaimBuster	9842	I just do want to say one thing, however.	0
ClaimBuster	9843	Andrea, I think we both have a responsibility to try to address the issues.	0
ClaimBuster	9844	Crime has come down the last 2 years, for the first time in many, many decades that it has come down -- or since we've kept records -- 2 consecutive years, and last year it came down the biggest drop in crime that we've had.	1
ClaimBuster	9845	We need a million-man active reserve that could be called up on an instant's notice, and that would be also trained, ready to use that type of equipment.	0
ClaimBuster	9846	That deficit is ruining the long-term hopes for this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	9847	I will make a flat statement: The United States of America has no long-term designs on staying in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	9848	So we have a very robust set of plans.	0
ClaimBuster	9849	Now that's not a government takeover.	0
ClaimBuster	9850	He's the only president to have incomes of families go down for the last three years; the only president to see exports go down; the only president to see the lowest level of business investment in our country as it is today.	1
ClaimBuster	9851	I would like to point out that when we look at our programs in Latin America, we find that we have appropriated five times as much for Latin America as was appropriated by the previous Administration; we find that we have two billion dollars more for the Export-Import Bank; we have a new bank for Latin America alone of a billion dollars; we have the new program which was submitted at the Bogota Conference - this new program that President Eisenhower submitted, approved by the last Congress - for five hundred million dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	9852	It's a very tense situation there.	0
ClaimBuster	9853	I am very careful in public life about dealing with classified information.	0
ClaimBuster	9854	And the answer is, yes, if I'm president, America will be very strong.	0
ClaimBuster	9855	But I - I hope to have a complete uh responsibility on my shoulders to help bring about a - a fair uh - criminal justice system and also to - to bring about uh - an end to the - to the divise- divisiveness that has occurred in our country uh as a result of the Vietnam War.	0
ClaimBuster	9856	Senator McCain talks a lot about drilling, and that's important, but we have three percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.	1
ClaimBuster	9857	I learned that the hard way and the Governor and I both supported slipping the COLAs for one year.	1
ClaimBuster	9858	There is another point that should be made.	0
ClaimBuster	9859	And it seems to me that when you make a decision, the decision is made by the President of the United States, by the Commander-in-Chief.	1
ClaimBuster	9860	This is the first time the United States of America has ever had a tax cut when we're at war.	1
ClaimBuster	9861	A good family is a place where love and discipline and good values are transmuted (sic) from the elders to the children, a place where people turn for refuge, and where they know they're the most important people in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	9862	We do need to look at our records.	0
ClaimBuster	9863	The New York Times actually wrote an article about it, but they don't even care.	1
ClaimBuster	9864	I think we should have an educational system second to none.	0
ClaimBuster	9865	Let me tell you one thing I didn't sign, and I think it shows the difference of our opinion -- the difference of opinions.	0
ClaimBuster	9866	I think it's time for them to fish or cut bait.	0
ClaimBuster	9867	If you forecast it out, we still have a significant deficit under each of their plans, as I understand them.	0
ClaimBuster	9868	It's probably the worst one of all.	0
ClaimBuster	9869	We can do that by reducing Federal taxes as I proposed uh - about a year ago when I called for a tax reduction of $28 billion - three-quarters of it to go to private uh taxpayers and uh one-quarter to the business sector.	1
ClaimBuster	9870	He can make any excuse he wants, but the facts are that we're reducing the number of uninsured percentage of our population.	1
ClaimBuster	9871	The chairman of the Republican Party thinks we ought to change a few things.	1
ClaimBuster	9872	You've got cross-border attacks against U.S. troops.	1
ClaimBuster	9873	I come from a different point.	0
ClaimBuster	9874	I wanted to get something done.	0
ClaimBuster	9875	Sorry, but that's just not -- that's just not the facts.	0
ClaimBuster	9876	Why didn't you add other things into the deal?	0
ClaimBuster	9877	No, we need a chief executive who is prepared to lead; who won't blame the Congress; who will lead to bring down that deficit, who will make tough choices on spending	0
ClaimBuster	9878	And that's the difference between the president and me.	0
ClaimBuster	9879	Well, I have a different view.	0
ClaimBuster	9880	I thought I owed that to you and I respect you for being here and for the impact you've had on making this a more positive experience.	0
ClaimBuster	9881	We have to be able to make a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	9882	It would be neat and plausible and wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	9883	Then the Embassy was blown up a few weeks ago, and once again none of the steps that should have been taken were taken.	1
ClaimBuster	9884	We just don't want to see it creep back up.	0
ClaimBuster	9885	The Soviet Union may not agree to an inspection system.	0
ClaimBuster	9886	The United States today, according to Prime Minister Rabin of Israel, is a- at a peak in its uh - influence and power in the Middle East.	1
ClaimBuster	9887	It's something that we pay into now so that we will have a secure retirement, and our parents and grandparents will have a secure retirement.	0
ClaimBuster	9888	I have -- was fought for a very strong title in the farm bill for the conservation reserve program to set aside millions of acres of land to help improve wildlife and the habitat.	1
ClaimBuster	9889	And it starts with making sure we rebuild our military power.	0
ClaimBuster	9890	And I've never wavered in my life.	0
ClaimBuster	9891	And we can do it.	0
ClaimBuster	9892	That's part of an overall overhaul.	0
ClaimBuster	9893	I have never said that I object to nuclear waste.	1
ClaimBuster	9894	Thank you Kerry for your question, it's an important one.	0
ClaimBuster	9895	And, you know, that's -- you're right.	0
ClaimBuster	9896	We are 2nd in tax burden, the 2nd lowest tax burden in the country.	1
ClaimBuster	9897	And I'm so glad I did it.	0
ClaimBuster	9898	If you want to participate in some of the dynamic changes that are going on in our country, you will get specific help in doing that.	0
ClaimBuster	9899	Let me come back and say, why is it that I don't want to raise taxes?	0
ClaimBuster	9900	And here you've got, for the disadvantaged children, you've got to have early childhood development.	0
ClaimBuster	9901	They can buy a computer for their kid who's going off to college, which means they're spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers.	1
ClaimBuster	9902	More sometimes than people in foreign countries.	0
ClaimBuster	9903	The governor proposes $45 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	9904	And perhaps that's another thing we can depoliticize.	0
ClaimBuster	9905	A tax increase, a tax on everybody in America.	1
ClaimBuster	9906	I retract nothing that I have said.	0
ClaimBuster	9907	Now there are some 10,000 centrifuges spinning uranium, preparing to create a nuclear threat to the United States and to the world.	1
ClaimBuster	9908	Yes, I'm very embarrassed by it.	0
ClaimBuster	9909	And the vast majority of all family businesses would be completely exempt, and all of the others would have sharply reduced.	1
ClaimBuster	9910	The person responsible for domestic economic policy in my administration will be Bill Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	9911	Use--work internationally to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	9912	I never got to say that.	0
ClaimBuster	9913	I can't fix the statistics.	0
ClaimBuster	9914	We are spending a fortune doing it.	1
ClaimBuster	9915	And we put up with that.	0
ClaimBuster	9916	First of all, Governor Romney talks about small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	9917	They have done a good job in integrating the money supply with the uh - fiscal policy of the uh - executive and legislative branches of the government.	0
ClaimBuster	9918	In public education when we just move children through the schools.	0
ClaimBuster	9919	We're talking about Joe the plumber.	0
ClaimBuster	9920	Now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no Al Qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	9921	Let me make one last point.	0
ClaimBuster	9922	Then when I had 2 people imprisoned in Iran, I could have left them there.	0
ClaimBuster	9923	The president actually cut the money for it.	1
ClaimBuster	9924	And when they decide not to plow a field that is vulnerable to soil erosion, that may cost them a little money, but it helps the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	9925	So I have confidence that General Petraeus, working with the Pakistanis, working with the Afghans, doing the same job that he did in Iraq, will again.	0
ClaimBuster	9926	We have spent $4 trillion worth.	1
ClaimBuster	9927	I'm not just saying this.	0
ClaimBuster	9928	He introduced or supported legislation back then that suggested that kids of Massachusetts should be exempt from going overseas in that war.	1
ClaimBuster	9929	In the Oval Office, you can't predict what kind of crisis is going to come up.	0
ClaimBuster	9930	Sometimes people feel a little uncomfortable talking about this, but it's much clearer for me now.	0
ClaimBuster	9931	We need higher teachers' salaries.	0
ClaimBuster	9932	"They passed the resolution that said, ""Disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences."""	1
ClaimBuster	9933	Now, I'll go beyond that and say I think we need much more focus on rural economic development programs.	0
ClaimBuster	9934	I've never seen such ideological squabbles in the Congress of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	9935	The rest of them know we're after them.	1
ClaimBuster	9936	So I went to the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	9937	I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	9938	We hadn't done the work that ought to be done.	0
ClaimBuster	9939	The military's job is to win the war.	0
ClaimBuster	9940	But it's an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off we're going to be.	0
ClaimBuster	9941	There's a difference between being a quarterback and a cheerleader, and when there's a real problem, a President must confront it.	0
ClaimBuster	9942	In the Africa south of the Sahara, which is the major new section, we have less students from all of Africa in that area studying under government auspices today than from the country of Thailand.	1
ClaimBuster	9943	And I supported a big expansion in safe and drug-free schools program to support things like the DARE program because I thought all those things were very important.	1
ClaimBuster	9944	He repeated that error in 1959, in the speech that he made.	1
ClaimBuster	9945	And if Mr. Carter alleges that His Holiness by signing that has done it, he is totally inaccurate.	0
ClaimBuster	9946	We've had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated.	1
ClaimBuster	9947	I do think it's fair to note -- he can rebut it -- but Arkansas is one of the few states that doesn't have any civil rights legislation.	1
ClaimBuster	9948	Encouragement by the president for people to uh voluntarily conserve - yes.	0
ClaimBuster	9949	I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.	0
ClaimBuster	9950	He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs.	0
ClaimBuster	9951	There are actually more people in government except for people in defense related jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	9952	We need to make it very clear -- whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else -- the United States has much greater capacity.	0
ClaimBuster	9953	Jim, if I -- if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it.	1
ClaimBuster	9954	And I believe, for example, that there is a right of privacy in the Fourth Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	9955	If they weren't willing to work a deal, then we could have put sanctions together.	0
ClaimBuster	9956	24 years ago I supported full public financing of all federal elections.	1
ClaimBuster	9957	So the fact of the matter is that if I occasionally have mistaken your policies for George Bush's policies, it's because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities, you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	9958	If his record is the opposite of that, that means that he doesn't want to go into it.	0
ClaimBuster	9959	These are small -- these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	9960	Instead of high unemployment, we now have the lowest African-American unemployment, the lowest Latino unemployment ever measured.	1
ClaimBuster	9961	But we'll get the rest of that tax relief.	0
ClaimBuster	9962	We haven't been paying attention to them.	0
ClaimBuster	9963	But is that really the question that should be asked?	0
ClaimBuster	9964	His program under Social Security, would require everybody who had Social Security to take government health insurance whether he wanted it or not.	1
ClaimBuster	9965	We have one of the most advanced patient's bill of rights.	1
ClaimBuster	9966	Seventeen million Americans, who live over sixty-five on an average Social Security check of about seventy-eight dollars a month, they're not able to sustain themselves individually, but they can sustain themselves through the social security system.	1
ClaimBuster	9967	Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced.	0
ClaimBuster	9968	You have to earn that respect.	0
ClaimBuster	9969	The other thing, I'm extremely underleveraged.	0
ClaimBuster	9970	And then when you add in his other spending proposals, regrettably you end up socking it to the working man.	0
ClaimBuster	9971	Then that would give us ten years to do with Medicare what we're going to do with Social Security; have a bipartisan group look at what we have to do to save it when the baby boomers retire.	0
ClaimBuster	9972	"And it used the term ""death of the unborn child.''"	1
ClaimBuster	9973	I think, as technology improves, we'll be able to do even better with that.	0
ClaimBuster	9974	One more time you've bought a front-row box seat and got a third-rate performance.	0
ClaimBuster	9975	Folks, the test is not if you've added money; the test is that you've done everything possible to make America secure.	0
ClaimBuster	9976	So, I'm for continued research, but I also want strong conventional forces.	0
ClaimBuster	9977	Now, what is true is that Senator McCain and I have a difference in terms of the need to invest in America and the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	9978	I want to thank Arizona State as well.	0
ClaimBuster	9979	The Federal Reserve has uh - an independent status that ought to be preserved; I think that Mr. uh - Burns did take a typical, erroneous Republican attitude in the 1973 year when inflation was so high.	1
ClaimBuster	9980	Why didn't we bring students over here?	0
ClaimBuster	9981	Already, we have a recovery that has been going on for about 21 months to the point that we can now call it an expansion.	1
ClaimBuster	9982	And we can create more jobs there in a hurry than any other place.	0
ClaimBuster	9983	Well, I've expressed my heartfelt difference with Governor Clinton on organizing demonstrations while in a foreign land against your country, when young ghetto kids have been drafted and are dying.	1
ClaimBuster	9984	If we could have intervened effectively in the Holocaust, who among us would say that we had a moral obligation not to go in?	0
ClaimBuster	9985	The problem is that he's been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasn't been able to identify them.	1
ClaimBuster	9986	He trusts the government to order a woman to do what it thinks she ought to do.	0
ClaimBuster	9987	"A few years ago when he came to office, the president said -- these are his words -- ""What we need are some good conservative judges on the courts."""	1
ClaimBuster	9988	And part of that is bringing in a pipeline of oil from Canada, taking advantage of the oil and coal we have here, drilling offshore in Alaska, drilling offshore in Virginia where the people want it.	0
ClaimBuster	9989	Drug therapies are replacing a lot of medicines as we used to know it.	1
ClaimBuster	9990	Everybody that pays taxes is going to get tax relief.	0
ClaimBuster	9991	And I said that I felt that rather than tell the lie which we told, rather than indicate that the flights would continue - in fact, I believe Mr. Nixon himself said on May fifteenth that the flights would continue even though Mr. Herter testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that they had been canceled as of May twelfth - that it would have been far better that if we had expressed regrets, if that would have saved the summit, and if the summit is useful - and I believe it is.	1
ClaimBuster	9992	But some way or other, there were 12 of the original copies that got out down there and were not submitted for this printing process by the CIA.	1
ClaimBuster	9993	And it's also regulatory reform.	0
ClaimBuster	9994	Being lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	9995	So, we have to make decisions based upon uncertainty, and that means a strong military.	0
ClaimBuster	9996	I believe America is safest and strongest when we are leading the world and we are leading strong alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	9997	It hasn't produced a quart of oil or a lump of coal, or anything else in the line of energy.	1
ClaimBuster	9998	No, of course not, absolutely not, I want them to be tougher.	0
ClaimBuster	9999	I want to put money in your pocket.	0
ClaimBuster	10000	And I think that's great.	0
ClaimBuster	10001	... and a great first lady.	0
ClaimBuster	10002	I would like to point out also that senators like Henry Jackson and Hollings of South Carolina - they are taking the lead in the fight against this particular treaty.	1
ClaimBuster	10003	We have to renegotiate our trade deals.	0
ClaimBuster	10004	I don't think the government oughta do anything to encourage abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	10005	But the way to make sure our economy grows is not to raise taxes on small-business owners.	0
ClaimBuster	10006	But I'll try harder to keep it on a high plane.	0
ClaimBuster	10007	... from everything I see, has no respect for this person.	0
ClaimBuster	10008	They're running millions of dollars of ads against me.	1
ClaimBuster	10009	I'm an optimist, but we have to make the right choices, to be fiscally responsible and to create the new jobs of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	10010	- has to be taken by the Federal Government and when we took action, it had a favorable response.	0
ClaimBuster	10011	No, what I said was that, because we achieved such a rapid victory, more of the Saddam loyalists were around.	1
ClaimBuster	10012	But I do say that any statement to the effect that the Republican party is trigger-happy is belied by the record.	0
ClaimBuster	10013	They have got to bear a greater share of this load of economic assistance abroad.	0
ClaimBuster	10014	Well, as I've said, I am not an enemy of conservation.	0
ClaimBuster	10015	I've met kids in Ohio, parents in Wisconsin places, Iowa, where they're going out on the Internet to get the state-of-the-art body gear to send to their kids.	1
ClaimBuster	10016	Governor Reagan's approach to our energy policy, which has already proven its effectiveness, is to repeal, or to change substantially, the windfall profits tax - to return a major portion of $227 billion back to the oil companies; to do away with the Department of Energy; to short-circuit our synthetic fuels program; to put a minimal emphasis on solar power; to emphasize strongly nuclear power plants as a major source of energy in the future.	1
ClaimBuster	10017	Well what we do is what the Attorney-General of the United States did under the direction of the President: call in the owners of chain stores and get them to take action.	1
ClaimBuster	10018	And also the country that just freed three Americans that will help us create jobs in America because they will be a market for our goods and products without having to pay -- without us having to pay the billions of dollars -- the billion dollars and more that we've already paid.	0
ClaimBuster	10019	Now, this is guy a who, along with others, has taken great risk for great freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	10020	Employment will be up, revenues will be up.	0
ClaimBuster	10021	It seems to me that those who sit in Washington eighteen months after the incident are not the best judges of the decision-making process that had to be made by the National Security Council and by myself at the time the incident was developing in the Pacific.	0
ClaimBuster	10022	And she was fiercely independent.	0
ClaimBuster	10023	And if you want to pay for the rest of his plan, all the other spending programs, you're going to sock it to the working man.	0
ClaimBuster	10024	We've got to reduce our deficit, but we've got to do it in a balanced way.	0
ClaimBuster	10025	And I want to make sure that we are focused on those programs that work.	0
ClaimBuster	10026	And, very simply, in the inner city, they're starved -- you see, small business is the way to jump start the inner city, not --	0
ClaimBuster	10027	That is one of the major challenges and major undertakings that I will assume as the next president.	0
ClaimBuster	10028	But let's go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions.	1
ClaimBuster	10029	Employers would cover their employees, government would cover the unemployed.	0
ClaimBuster	10030	There's no doubt about it that many American people have lost their faith in government.	0
ClaimBuster	10031	It's just not the way I think and it's not my intentions and not my plan.	1
ClaimBuster	10032	I happen to believe it is.	0
ClaimBuster	10033	Let me just say categorically I'm proud of the people that come to our rallies.	0
ClaimBuster	10034	When we say we're somebody's friend, everybody has got to believe it.	0
ClaimBuster	10035	We took care of the safety issues.	1
ClaimBuster	10036	I love America just as all of you love America.	0
ClaimBuster	10037	But you've also got to show that you are prepared to bring the rest of the world in and share the stakes.	0
ClaimBuster	10038	We've never had citizenship tests in our country before, and I don't think we should have a citizenship card today.	1
ClaimBuster	10039	When you're president you expect this.	0
ClaimBuster	10040	I want the men and women of our Armed Forces to have the support they need to defend us; the support they need when they risk our lives to keep us free and to keep this country free.	0
ClaimBuster	10041	Now, there was a second phase in the Iranian affair in which we had something to do with that.	1
ClaimBuster	10042	This exciting future will not only give us more energy security, but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that we've put into effect.	0
ClaimBuster	10043	I should make it very clear that I do not think we're doing enough, that I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that we're making.	0
ClaimBuster	10044	It's very important that we not just, without thinking it through, just rush to every problem in the world and have our people torn to pieces.	0
ClaimBuster	10045	That will strengthen us and weaken them when it comes to issues like Georgia.	0
ClaimBuster	10046	And I'm not going to cede those jobs of the future to those countries.	0
ClaimBuster	10047	And part of that leadership is sending the right message to places like North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	10048	We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none.	0
ClaimBuster	10049	In fact, I've said the opposite: I will never turn the security of the United States over to any nation.	0
ClaimBuster	10050	President Eisenhower moves from the scene on January twentieth and the next four years are the critical years.	1
ClaimBuster	10051	And that was -- that was -- that was what allowed us to become the number one state in the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	10052	As we have seen tonight, foreign policy and defense policy are difficult and complex issues.	0
ClaimBuster	10053	"This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, ""You know, I alone can fix it,"" as he said on the convention stage."	1
ClaimBuster	10054	I don't believe the United States did that.	0
ClaimBuster	10055	We got rid of that; we've kept out of other wars; and certainly that doesn't indicate that we're trigger-happy.	1
ClaimBuster	10056	This idea of nation building is kind of a pejorative phrase, but think about the great conflict of the past century, World War II.	0
ClaimBuster	10057	I -- I don't think that Senator Obama understands that there was a failed state in Pakistan when Musharraf came to power.	1
ClaimBuster	10058	I don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt.	0
ClaimBuster	10059	Young people with high grades can't get a job.	1
ClaimBuster	10060	And I must say, after reading the Vice President's speech before the farmers, as he read mine, I don't believe that it's very much different from Mr. Benson's.	0
ClaimBuster	10061	If you are out of work, you have nothing to eat or you can't have medical care, or you're holding a crack baby in your arms right now, what do you do next?	0
ClaimBuster	10062	Mine has been in the executive branch.	1
ClaimBuster	10063	I exempt small businesses from having to pay into a kitty.	1
ClaimBuster	10064	You want to buy into it, you can.	0
ClaimBuster	10065	And the funny thing was that California, which is normally above the national average in inflation and unemployment, for those six years for the first time, was below the national average in both inflation and unemployment.	1
ClaimBuster	10066	But there's a larger law.	0
ClaimBuster	10067	It seems to me that to deny the responsibility of the Federal Government to do something about our crumbling cities is to deny the opportunity for one thing: To 55% of the black population of our country that is locked within the inner cities of the metropolitan areas of our country.	1
ClaimBuster	10068	And I didn't pick him because he agreed with me on everything.	0
ClaimBuster	10069	To do that we need a three-pronged attack: one is military assistance to our friends who are being pressured; secondly, a strong and sophisticated economic aid program and human rights program that offers a better life and a sharper alternative to the alternative offered by the totalitarians who oppose us; and finally, a strong diplomatic effort that pursues the possibilities of peace in the area.	0
ClaimBuster	10070	We need to give teachers the training and professional development that they need, including a paid time off to go visit the classroom of a master teacher to pick up some new skills.	0
ClaimBuster	10071	I also have had the opportunity of knowing and meeting other Communist leaders in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	10072	Well, let me just tell you before we go any further.	0
ClaimBuster	10073	That doesn't get the job done.	0
ClaimBuster	10074	The president sides with the power companies, the oil companies, the drug companies.	0
ClaimBuster	10075	We did it by taking $60 billion that was going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, and we said, let's just cut out the middleman.	1
ClaimBuster	10076	And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he's denied being for the war in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	10077	I don't want to be the world's policeman, I want to be the world's peacemaker by having a military of high morale and a military that is well-equipped.	0
ClaimBuster	10078	We have found also in our studies that in this increase in poverty, it all had to do with their private earnings.	1
ClaimBuster	10079	You have to decide whether you want to change or not.	0
ClaimBuster	10080	The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with.	0
ClaimBuster	10081	Because we've had tough aggressive trade policies, and because we've got interest rates down.	1
ClaimBuster	10082	Our country is not strong anymore; we're not respected anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	10083	Because they know as Senator Kennedy will have to know that if you do that you encourage them to more aggression.	0
ClaimBuster	10084	The notion that we would have tanks run over those young people who were in Tahrir Square, that is not the kind of American leadership that John F. Kennedy talked about 50 years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	10085	I have a record of fighting for fiscal responsibility.	1
ClaimBuster	10086	And I've met wives who are supportive of their husbands or vice versa when they finally sort of broke out and allowed themselves to live who they were, who they felt God had made them.	0
ClaimBuster	10087	And that wasn't just about a problem between Georgia and Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	10088	I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem.	1
ClaimBuster	10089	Let's not forget that our national security and our economic security go hand in hand.	0
ClaimBuster	10090	And I think that we'll have good results uh - on November the second for myself and I hope for the country.	0
ClaimBuster	10091	And it's gotten worse under President Bush over the course of the last years.	0
ClaimBuster	10092	Bring students here; let them see what kind of a country we have.	0
ClaimBuster	10093	And it's not only just America, but NATO is now helping, Jordan's helping train police, UAE is helping train police.	1
ClaimBuster	10094	It's really interesting, because the president used that very plan as a reason for seniors to accept his prescription drug plan.	1
ClaimBuster	10095	Now, some say, oh, you're a Republican, you can't be reaching out to these people.	0
ClaimBuster	10096	We cut the deficit by 60 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	10097	Secretary, is it President Obama's fault?	0
ClaimBuster	10098	It's time to have a fresh start.	0
ClaimBuster	10099	Number three, stop the federal government's program that now gives low-interest loans and job training funds to companies that will actually shut down and move to other countries, but we won't do the same thing for plants that stay here.	0
ClaimBuster	10100	And that certainly would not help us in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	10101	The -- where they're partnering so that they're designing training programs.	0
ClaimBuster	10102	Mr. Bush wants to spend billions on Star Wars.	0
ClaimBuster	10103	And, lastly, the other night on character Governor Clinton said it's not the character of the president but the character of the presidency.	1
ClaimBuster	10104	And he'll say it has something to do with Roe v. Wade, about the Illinois State Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	10105	I say if Germany can cover everybody and keep costs under inflation, if Hawaii can cover 98% of their people at lower health care costs than the rest of us, if Rochester, New York, can do it with two-thirds of the cost of the rest of it, America can do it, too.	1
ClaimBuster	10106	The opportunities for us in Latin America we have just not taken advantage of fully.	0
ClaimBuster	10107	Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade.	1
ClaimBuster	10108	I tell you one thing I'm not going to do is I'm not going to let the United States carry the burden for cleaning up the world's air.	0
ClaimBuster	10109	Let me make one other suggestion, because you're a teacher, you can have an impact on that.	0
ClaimBuster	10110	"Now, the president said, ""I'm not blocking that."""	1
ClaimBuster	10111	Mr. Ford quite often puts forward a program just as a public relations stunt, and never tries to put it through the Congress by working with the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	10112	These are the great questions: equality of education in school.	0
ClaimBuster	10113	I have a plan for Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	10114	In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	10115	It's time to get something done.	0
ClaimBuster	10116	I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	10117	The president just said that government-run health care results in poor quality.	1
ClaimBuster	10118	I might go back to one other thing.	0
ClaimBuster	10119	We have to have money to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	10120	Let me take just one question that he raises - the military strength and capability of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	10121	"And they have to live and go to bed at night thinking, ""Is this true?"	0
ClaimBuster	10122	No, I'm a gentlemen, Hillary.	0
ClaimBuster	10123	His name is Randy Ellis.	1
ClaimBuster	10124	And when I am president, I'm going to do it because we have to.	0
ClaimBuster	10125	The uh - emphasis, I think, of the - of the court system uh - should be to interpret the uh - the Constitution and the laws uh - equally between property protection and personal protection.	0
ClaimBuster	10126	And the children get lost in the process.	0
ClaimBuster	10127	But before I can do that, I must challenge the American people to change, and they must decide.	0
ClaimBuster	10128	Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives.	0
ClaimBuster	10129	Well, that's the only protection the taxpayer has against some of these reckless pork programs up there, and I'd rather be able to just line it right out of there and get on about passing some good stuff but leave out the garbage.	0
ClaimBuster	10130	I've been very careful - I have been very careful in saying that what I'm going to do is to bring Federal spending under control first.	0
ClaimBuster	10131	We say, if you get caught carrying a gun, you're automatically detained.	0
ClaimBuster	10132	But we also have to recognize that, you know, for us to get more entangled militarily in Syria is a serious step, and we have to do so making absolutely certain that we know who we are helping; that we're not putting arms in the hands of folks who eventually could turn them against us or allies in the region.	0
ClaimBuster	10133	There is the Republican Guard in Iran, which Senator Kyl had an amendment in order to declare them a sponsor of terror.	1
ClaimBuster	10134	I'm against giving anybody any kind of preference for something they're not qualified for.	0
ClaimBuster	10135	So what did we do?	0
ClaimBuster	10136	First of all, I cannot tell you how deeply I respect the belief about life and when it begins.	0
ClaimBuster	10137	And God bless the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	10138	My plan is not like anything that's been tried before.	1
ClaimBuster	10139	I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	10140	I mean, there's plenty of them that I oppose, but what I am not going to do, when we are negotiating with the Soviet Union, sitting down talking to Mr. Gorbachev about how we achieve a 50 percent reduction in our strategic weapons, I'm not going to give away a couple of aces I that very tough card game.	0
ClaimBuster	10141	And I have said again and again and again let's get off mud wrestling, let's get off personalities and let's talk about jobs, health care, crime, the things that concern the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	10142	I've said to the extent we spend federal money on disadvantaged children, we want the schools to show us whether or not the children are learning.	1
ClaimBuster	10143	We must never waver in the face of this enemy that -- these ideologues of hate.	0
ClaimBuster	10144	And I've put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort.	1
ClaimBuster	10145	America and the world are safer for it.	0
ClaimBuster	10146	Mr. Ford, again, under pressure from the atomic energy lobby, has insisted that this reprocessing or rather re-en- enrichment be done by private industry and not by the existing uh - government uh - plants.	1
ClaimBuster	10147	These people have all left.	1
ClaimBuster	10148	And the proof, the proof of whether a strategy is working or not is what the price is that you're paying at the pump.	0
ClaimBuster	10149	We're consuming 50 percent of the world's cocaine.	1
ClaimBuster	10150	You'd go broke in a hurry.	0
ClaimBuster	10151	It's a central part of dealing with weapons of mass destruction and proliferation.	0
ClaimBuster	10152	And everybody's getting a fair share -- everybody's doing a fair share, and everybody's playing by the same rules.	0
ClaimBuster	10153	That doesn't mean we have to write it into the law.	0
ClaimBuster	10154	They're dying to get the commercial airline business.	0
ClaimBuster	10155	I will put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox and protect them.	0
ClaimBuster	10156	She did call it the gold standard.	1
ClaimBuster	10157	But I have to confess that it was the first time that I really focused on it in a new way.	0
ClaimBuster	10158	That's another trillion dollars -- that's $8 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	10159	It's good to see you again, Senator Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	10160	It's not going to cost the government money.	0
ClaimBuster	10161	They're half, now of what they were when we came into office, and with my policy of getting this deficit under control, they'll be a lot less.	1
ClaimBuster	10162	And that is what every president has done, as far as I know, in the past but what every other president's has done.	0
ClaimBuster	10163	Just -- a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on American families.	1
ClaimBuster	10164	We've had the lowest rate of increase of economic growth in the last nine months of any major industrialized society in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	10165	"To me that concept is completely repugnant."""	0
ClaimBuster	10166	I do strongly support the WIC program.	0
ClaimBuster	10167	But this will be an interesting moment for the Russians to step up and lead as well.	0
ClaimBuster	10168	You are robbing the American people of their savings.	0
ClaimBuster	10169	And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn't paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he's going to do.	1
ClaimBuster	10170	Well, I must say that uh - Mr. Truman has uh - his methods of expressing things; he's been in politics for fifty years; he's been president of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	10171	I would remind Senator Kennedy of the past fifty years.	0
ClaimBuster	10172	A billion dollars more than the president recently signed into law.	0
ClaimBuster	10173	Well, that's how the commission -- bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	10174	We have gangs roaming the street.	1
ClaimBuster	10175	That line's getting a little bit old, I must say.	0
ClaimBuster	10176	We'll do whatever is necessary to be safe.	0
ClaimBuster	10177	I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real -- a really successful military operation.	0
ClaimBuster	10178	I think parents will be more involved with education when they know their children's classrooms are safe and secure as well.	0
ClaimBuster	10179	If you don't vote for me, I still want to be your president.	0
ClaimBuster	10180	But somehow in Washington today -- and I'm afraid on Wall Street -- greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption -- or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded.	0
ClaimBuster	10181	That's not how we're going to move our economy forward.	0
ClaimBuster	10182	"Will you guys give us permission to shift it over into training?"""	0
ClaimBuster	10183	I want to thank you and I want to thank everybody here tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	10184	I have talked in every speech about the fact that these are going to be very difficult times in the nineteen-sixties and that we're going to have to meet our responsibilities as citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	10185	They're having a hard time making ends meet.	0
ClaimBuster	10186	We gave it off to a slow start and a fast finish to give the economy time to recover.	1
ClaimBuster	10187	If you're a parent and you're struggling to get health insurance for your children, Senator Obama will fine you.	1
ClaimBuster	10188	Secondly -- and they're good.	0
ClaimBuster	10189	You've got to have world class teachers, world class books.	0
ClaimBuster	10190	Our military is second to none in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	10191	I believe in 1960 and sixty-one and two and three we have a rendezvous with destiny.	0
ClaimBuster	10192	So as far as the respect of our own people toward our own government, as far as participating in the shaping of uh - concepts and commitments, as far as the trust of our country among the nations of the world, as far as dependence of our country in meeting the needs and obligations that we've expressed to our allies, as far as the respect of our country - even among our potential adversaries - we are weak.	0
ClaimBuster	10193	But if you send a Republican president and a Democratic majority and the threat of a veto hangs over the Congress, in my judgment you will continue what happened in the August session, which is a clash of parties and inaction.	0
ClaimBuster	10194	And we -- we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense.	1
ClaimBuster	10195	By the way, I just found out the other day an interesting fact, that there is a national petroleum reserve right next to -- in Prudhoe Bay that your administration opened up for exploration in that pristine area.	1
ClaimBuster	10196	"First, the Joint Chiefs of Staff went to the President, said, ""Don't put those troops there.''"	1
ClaimBuster	10197	I think price controls would hurt our ability to continue important research and development.	0
ClaimBuster	10198	The Vice President is complacent, thinks we ought to stick with the status quo, doesn't think we ought to move ahead, thinking things are okay as they are.	0
ClaimBuster	10199	We need to eliminate a whole host of programs that don't work.	0
ClaimBuster	10200	I have fought against -- well, one of them would be the marketing assistance program.	1
ClaimBuster	10201	And when you do that, you've have homeless families.	0
ClaimBuster	10202	I believe it was her campaign that did it.	0
ClaimBuster	10203	That's how much I care about it.	0
ClaimBuster	10204	I understand what it takes to make a bright and prosperous future for America again.	0
ClaimBuster	10205	We didn't also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put -- put people in a position where they're going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted.	0
ClaimBuster	10206	I mentioned the radical departure of Governor Reagan from the principles or ideals of historical perspective of his own party.	1
ClaimBuster	10207	The third is medical care for the aged which is tied to Social Security, which is financed out of Social Security funds.	0
ClaimBuster	10208	Now, I believe in community policing.	0
ClaimBuster	10209	Because if they put their currency down low, that means their prices on their goods are low.	1
ClaimBuster	10210	We must not meet the Communists purely in the field of gross atheistic materialism.	0
ClaimBuster	10211	I believe those negotiations should continue.	0
ClaimBuster	10212	"Now, the conversation I had with Joe the plumber, what I essentially said to him was, ""Five years ago, when you were in a position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then."""	1
ClaimBuster	10213	The President wants to spend 20 percent more in the next six years, and I want to spend 14 percent more and give that 6 percent back to the people.	1
ClaimBuster	10214	And when you have more money in your pocket, you're able to better afford things you want.	0
ClaimBuster	10215	If you make more than $60,000 and up to 100 you'll still get a match, but not as generous.	1
ClaimBuster	10216	We've got to stop drifting.	0
ClaimBuster	10217	They concluded there was no case; he said the FBI was rigged.	1
ClaimBuster	10218	But when a man's president of the United States, or a former president, he has an obligation not to lose his temper in public.	0
ClaimBuster	10219	Four years ago you said in your first year you would file legislation.	1
ClaimBuster	10220	Which one of those promises will you keep and which will you break, Governor?	0
ClaimBuster	10221	If you want someone who will fight for you and who will fight for the middle-class families and working men and women, who are sick and tired of having their parents and grandparents pay higher prices for prescription drugs than anybody else, then I want to fight for you.	0
ClaimBuster	10222	The first priority has to be on ending the violence, dampening down the tensions that have arisen there.	0
ClaimBuster	10223	We have gone certainly the extra mile and then some in making offers to the Soviet Union on control of tests, on disarmament, and in every other way.	0
ClaimBuster	10224	The other would be to make a judgment on what's the most effective tax program to stimulate our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	10225	But she's been there for 30 years she's been doing this stuff.	1
ClaimBuster	10226	Those programs you cannot afford and give tax relief.	0
ClaimBuster	10227	They ought to factor in it when they go to the voting booth.	0
ClaimBuster	10228	It's just -- it's -- we've got -- when the president took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year, and last year slower than the year before.	1
ClaimBuster	10229	And what did we do in the late '40's and '50's and '60's?	0
ClaimBuster	10230	In other words, we've got to be tough.	0
ClaimBuster	10231	This president has taken a $5.6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see.	1
ClaimBuster	10232	Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way.	0
ClaimBuster	10233	First of all, the Soviet Union if I have been critical of some of the previous agreements, it's because we've been out-negotiated for quite a long time.	0
ClaimBuster	10234	In addition to that we've had a chance to became now, contrary to our long-standing beliefs and principles, the arms merchant of the whole world.	0
ClaimBuster	10235	They'll do fine whether you're president or I am.	0
ClaimBuster	10236	It's an issue that good people obviously disagree on.	0
ClaimBuster	10237	Of course Mr. Nixon is wholly inaccurate when he says that the Congress has not provided more funds in fact than the President recommended for national defense.	1
ClaimBuster	10238	The President's economic plan calls for increasing the taxes to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way.	1
ClaimBuster	10239	We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults.	0
ClaimBuster	10240	It's stuck in the Senate, because the trial lawyers won't act on it.	1
ClaimBuster	10241	And I'm trying to emphasize that what I want to do is to continue to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	10242	Well, I must have been living through a different eight years then the ones the vice president's been living through, because this administration has cut and slashed and cut and slashed programs for children, for nutrition, for the kinds of things that can help these youngsters to live better lives.	1
ClaimBuster	10243	Well, I'll -- I'll be very quick.	0
ClaimBuster	10244	I have actually not questioned Governor Bush's experience.	1
ClaimBuster	10245	Number two, we've got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market -- and when the market returns.	0
ClaimBuster	10246	If you look at the history of a lower court judge's rulings, you can get a pretty good idea of how they'll interpret questions.	0
ClaimBuster	10247	And in that process, they can get government help and government guarantees, but they need to go through bankruptcy to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden that they'd -- they'd built up.	1
ClaimBuster	10248	And so I refuse to measure one's commitment as to whether you're going to double the spending.	0
ClaimBuster	10249	The very minute effect of the action which has been taken this week on Cuba's economy - I believe Castro can replace those markets very easily through Latin America, through Europe, and through Eastern Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	10250	Exaggerations like, for example, only 5% of seniors receive benefits under my Medicare reform package.	1
ClaimBuster	10251	And I think it goes beyond just the response to terror.	0
ClaimBuster	10252	So I'd get rid of that one from day one.	0
ClaimBuster	10253	And we will have so many people who are qualified for the top job that it will be terrific.	0
ClaimBuster	10254	"So you say, ""Was it worth it?"""	0
ClaimBuster	10255	And so it isn't one and state governments have had a tough time.	0
ClaimBuster	10256	And this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face.	0
ClaimBuster	10257	And that's what needs to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	10258	I picked him because he was somebody who would be a strong Vice President, somebody who would be an active Vice President.	0
ClaimBuster	10259	They're now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier.	1
ClaimBuster	10260	They're good, solid men and women who have made good, sound judgments on behalf of the people of Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	10261	But what I'm not for what I'm not for is measuring it the way that the Democratic Congress does.	0
ClaimBuster	10262	But I think that's the American way.	0
ClaimBuster	10263	There were eleven dictators in South America and in Central America when we came in, in 1953.	1
ClaimBuster	10264	They will find a state -- maybe Arizona, maybe another state -- where there are no requirements for you to get cancer screenings, where there are no requirements for you to have to get pre-existing conditions, and they will all set up shop there.	1
ClaimBuster	10265	Look, our country is stagnant.	0
ClaimBuster	10266	He seems to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system; he says he's against new taxes, although he's broken that pledge at least times in the last year that I know of; he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five year, $40 billion tax break.	1
ClaimBuster	10267	And again, you might be able to make amendments all the time, Governor, but you've got to, as president, you can't be on all these different sides, and you can't have this pattern of saying well, I did this or I didn't, then the facts come out and you change it.	0
ClaimBuster	10268	I can promise you that I will try not to, and hard.	0
ClaimBuster	10269	I supported that route for some time and again I think it gets back to experience.	0
ClaimBuster	10270	I've been disturbed by the tone and the tenor of this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	10271	In fact uh - Mr. Nixon uh - discussed that a week ago in a speech.	1
ClaimBuster	10272	I am not talking of scrapping.	0
ClaimBuster	10273	We've got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers.	1
ClaimBuster	10274	And with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre-existing condition plan.	1
ClaimBuster	10275	We've got to make sure that works properly.	0
ClaimBuster	10276	And I shook hands with him on it and I appointed my members, and the commission never met.	1
ClaimBuster	10277	I'd like to come back to the question of nation building, but let me address the question directly, first.	0
ClaimBuster	10278	That's why I said tonight I'm for opportunity, responsibility and community.	0
ClaimBuster	10279	We won't be making airplanes in this country 10 years from now if we let deals like this go through.	0
ClaimBuster	10280	Well, very quickly, we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90 percent -- 90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country.	1
ClaimBuster	10281	And foreign companies are now coming in buying our -- buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil.	1
ClaimBuster	10282	I don't see this, incidentally, as a Democrat or a Republican or a liberal or conservative idea.	0
ClaimBuster	10283	And she'll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it.	0
ClaimBuster	10284	I think we can do better if we have the courage to change.	0
ClaimBuster	10285	Fourthly, I have suggested that the medical care for the aged - and the bill which the Congress now has passed and the President signed if fully implemented would cost a billion dollars on the Treasury - out of Treasury funds and a billion dollars by the states - the proposal that I have put forward and which many of the members of my party support is for medical care financed under Social Security; which would be financed under the Social Security taxes; which is less than three cents a day per person for medical care, doctors' bills, nurses, hospitals, when they retire.	1
ClaimBuster	10286	You know, you may have seen your health care premiums go up.	0
ClaimBuster	10287	I want to do that in industries, not just in Detroit, but all across the country and that means we change our tax code so we're giving incentives to companies that are investing here in the United States and creating jobs here.	0
ClaimBuster	10288	That wasn't true in his time, that's why my policy starts with a very robust policy to get all that energy in North America -- become energy secure.	0
ClaimBuster	10289	I do, and I'm standing up to the issue with an answer that's fair.	0
ClaimBuster	10290	As a matter of fact, this is a global effort.	1
ClaimBuster	10291	"But there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, ""We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby."""	0
ClaimBuster	10292	But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force.	0
ClaimBuster	10293	I'm not going to be a picker and chooser.	0
ClaimBuster	10294	I want to make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for small business, for big business, to invest and grow in America.	0
ClaimBuster	10295	It also allowed us to refocus on alliances and relationships that had been neglected for a decade.	0
ClaimBuster	10296	Because they have been hit hard over the last decade.	0
ClaimBuster	10297	Pretty simply, who's the best-qualified person up here on the stage to create jobs?	0
ClaimBuster	10298	You ought to make more decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	10299	One way, for instance, would be to have a single number.	0
ClaimBuster	10300	But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything.	1
ClaimBuster	10301	And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	10302	It would borrow up to $3 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	10303	The federal government should take no more than a third of anybody's check.	0
ClaimBuster	10304	It turned out to be a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	10305	Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle do not.	0
ClaimBuster	10306	When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious.	0
ClaimBuster	10307	And what we've seen over the last several years is Iran's influence grow.	0
ClaimBuster	10308	I'm totally focussed on the fact that we are still evading the issue of the Glaspie papers.	1
ClaimBuster	10309	And, incidentally, I might say that with regard to the 25-percent cut in Social Security -- before I get to the answer to your question -- the only 25-percent cut that I know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase, was a cut of 25 percent in the benefits for every American who was born after 1916.	1
ClaimBuster	10310	As soon as they have a change that allows the people to speak freely, they're wanting to develop some kind of blueprint that will help them be like us more, freedom, free markets, political freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	10311	"The head of the EPA said, ""You can't build a coal plant."	1
ClaimBuster	10312	And thank you to the Presidential Commission for undertaking this enormous task.	0
ClaimBuster	10313	And then just a day or two ago, the attorney general of the United States made a further investigation and came to precisely the same conclusion.	1
ClaimBuster	10314	In addition to that, we're going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early.	1
ClaimBuster	10315	For the last two years, I've been the president, and I have found from experience that it's much more difficult to make those decisions than it is to second-guess them.	1
ClaimBuster	10316	The Soviet Union has been moving faster than we have.	1
ClaimBuster	10317	Well, what about the citizen that stayed in their homes?	0
ClaimBuster	10318	Now, from the start of this campaign, I've identified this as one of my top priorities and here is what I think we have to do.	1
ClaimBuster	10319	But I believe the evidence is that our deployments have been successful, in Haiti, in Bosnia, when we moved to Kuwait to repel Saddam Hussein's threatened invasion of Kuwait.	1
ClaimBuster	10320	But that was something that happened.	1
ClaimBuster	10321	I notice particularly that he didn't endorse the Humphrey-Hawkins bill which he has on occasions and which is included as a part of the Democratic platform.	1
ClaimBuster	10322	Number one, let me just repeat, if you've got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it.	1
ClaimBuster	10323	It's because they no longer present the kind of viable economic climate that makes it possible for industry to remain there, or to locate there.	0
ClaimBuster	10324	They must continue to get those checks, and I believe that the system can be put on a sound actuarial basis.	0
ClaimBuster	10325	"This president in the last debate said, ""Well, that would be a big tax gap if we did that."""	1
ClaimBuster	10326	We do not spend a higher percentage of our income on public education than every other country.	1
ClaimBuster	10327	And therefore we passed an authorization - not an aid bill - which was the first time, really, since the Inter-American Bank which was founded a year ago was developed, that we really have looked at the needs of Latin America; that we have associated ourselves with those people.	1
ClaimBuster	10328	And that will always be the case as long as the Communists are on the international scene, in the aggressive tac- uh - tendencies that they presently are following.	0
ClaimBuster	10329	So, if he'd had his way, there wouldn't have been any housing project there at all.	0
ClaimBuster	10330	And it requires a president who is steadfast and strong and determined.	0
ClaimBuster	10331	I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	10332	Let me give you an example.	0
ClaimBuster	10333	So strong economy is very important.	0
ClaimBuster	10334	He hoped that there would be uh - b- be an agreement in part in disarmament.	0
ClaimBuster	10335	And not legislating from the bench.	0
ClaimBuster	10336	You know, I'd been in public life a long time and no one had ever questioned my role and so I was asked a lot of questions about things that happened a long time ago and I don't think I answered them as well as I could have.	1
ClaimBuster	10337	Mr. Hankins, I don't feel good about it, and I think we ought to have a patient's bill of rights to take the medical decisions away from the HMOs and give them back to the doctors and nurses.	0
ClaimBuster	10338	There are certain army bases that the act calls for that can be used in certain cases to shelter people when it's rough.	1
ClaimBuster	10339	Have you noticed, they've been in charge the last two years.	1
ClaimBuster	10340	There's -- you don't have to take my word for this.	0
ClaimBuster	10341	The man who should be here tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend.	1
ClaimBuster	10342	Tell Tony Blair we're going alone.	0
ClaimBuster	10343	It's too much to hope that this is going to continue, but I do hope that it will continue.	0
ClaimBuster	10344	But I run because I believe this year the United States has a great opportunity to make a move forward, to make a determination here at home and around the world, that it's going to reestablish itself as a vigorous society.	0
ClaimBuster	10345	They've all got a lot of anxieties out there.	0
ClaimBuster	10346	Education is how to make sure we've got a workforce that's productive and competitive.	0
ClaimBuster	10347	You say who's making these deals?	0
ClaimBuster	10348	And then we had Somalia -- then we had the first Gulf War.	1
ClaimBuster	10349	Second, as far as this report is concerned, I would have no objection to having it made public.	0
ClaimBuster	10350	And all Americans will open their wallets and their hearts to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	10351	You see that every night on television.	0
ClaimBuster	10352	They bring their crops in or their livestock in, many of them about the same time.	1
ClaimBuster	10353	You're supposed to have a government that comes from you.	0
ClaimBuster	10354	Well, bringing people together, again, is obviously a responsibility we all have.	0
ClaimBuster	10355	Cleaning up two-thirds of the worst toxic waste dumps.	0
ClaimBuster	10356	And therein, I think Governor Clinton keeps talking about trickle down, trickle down, and he's still talking about spending more and taxing more.	0
ClaimBuster	10357	But uh - Mr. Burns uh - in that respect made a very serious mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	10358	I have never made the statement that he suggested about nuclear proliferation and nuclear proliferation, or the trying to halt it, would be a major part of a foreign policy of mine.	1
ClaimBuster	10359	It is that we are continuing to spend too much.	0
ClaimBuster	10360	As Secretary Gates, the defense secretary, said, the war against terrorism began in that region and that's where it will end.	1
ClaimBuster	10361	And we're going to make sure that if they do not meet the demands of the international community, then we are going to take all options necessary to make sure they don't have a nuclear weapon.	0
ClaimBuster	10362	We still have lots of troops in Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	10363	The truth, though, is that Al Qaeda is much weaker than it was when I came into office.	1
ClaimBuster	10364	And in the long-term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy.	0
ClaimBuster	10365	In my economic plan we increase it 39percent.	1
ClaimBuster	10366	She wants to fight for rebels.	1
ClaimBuster	10367	You've had your chance and it didn't work.	0
ClaimBuster	10368	And the reason it's so difficult for schools to control that is because in recent years there has been a flood of cheap handguns that are so widely available that kids are finding ways to get ahold of them.	0
ClaimBuster	10369	But let me -- let me not just stop there.	0
ClaimBuster	10370	For many of you, it is getting harder and harder to save, harder and harder to retire.	0
ClaimBuster	10371	The same way that you said that it was mission creep to go after Gadhafi.	1
ClaimBuster	10372	And Georgia and Ukraine are both major gateways of energy into Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	10373	Isn't it time to stop creating images?	0
ClaimBuster	10374	And you see, yes, my position has evolved.	0
ClaimBuster	10375	We're America, and we believe in our future and we know we have the ability to shape our future.	0
ClaimBuster	10376	this year, a year of recovery, we find that it's six and nine-tenths per cent and one of the highest in the world today.	1
ClaimBuster	10377	See, our differences are our strengths.	0
ClaimBuster	10378	If you pay taxes, you are going to get a benefit.	0
ClaimBuster	10379	The net result is uh - we think under Carla Hills, who's the chairman of my uh - urban development and uh - neighborhood revitalization program, we will really do a first-class job in helping uh - the communities throughout the country.	1
ClaimBuster	10380	And I would just say there are three things that I would like to say -- number one -- we do have to maintain the world's strongest defense.	0
ClaimBuster	10381	I feel completely at ease knowing that someday Senator Mondale might very well be president.	0
ClaimBuster	10382	I'd like to thank the people who've started with Mr. Perot who've come on to help our campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	10383	First of all, in terms of standing up to the leaders of my party, the first major bill that I voted on in the Senate was in support of tort reform, which wasn't very popular with trial lawyers, a major constituency in the Democratic Party.	1
ClaimBuster	10384	First, let me make sure that every senior listening today understands that when we're talking about reforming Social Security, that they'll still get their checks.	0
ClaimBuster	10385	And I try not to.	0
ClaimBuster	10386	I have been fighting for very strong anti-crime legislation -- habeas corpus reform, so you don't have these endless appeals, so when somebody gets sentenced, hey, this is for real.	1
ClaimBuster	10387	Then when they get off by themselves, they say nobody did it.	0
ClaimBuster	10388	How much did you cut licenses and permits on federal land and federal waters?	0
ClaimBuster	10389	The terrorists have won each time.	0
ClaimBuster	10390	I think the President was correct in ordering these flights.	0
ClaimBuster	10391	When it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue neutral way, close loopholes, deductions -- he hasn't identified which ones they are -- but that thereby bring down the corporate rate.	1
ClaimBuster	10392	One of the reasons is we almost had it done, and the speaker -- a very, able, decent fellow, I might add -- but he twisted the arms of some of the sponsors of that legislation and had them change their vote.	1
ClaimBuster	10393	And you bet we're gonna take a trillion dollars of your own money and let you invest it under safe guidelines so you get a better rate of return on the money than the paltry 2% that the federal government gets for you today.	1
ClaimBuster	10394	I was not opposing the principle of providing care for them.	1
ClaimBuster	10395	Well, I think the national debt affects everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	10396	The litmus test that John says is in the Republican platform, says no more than the judges to be appointed should have a respect for innocent life.	0
ClaimBuster	10397	And I said it numerous times.	1
ClaimBuster	10398	And at the same time, assuming that I sign the tax bill that was mentioned by Mr. Gannon, we will in the last two tax bills have increased the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayers.	1
ClaimBuster	10399	Those are my best ideas about it.	0
ClaimBuster	10400	Any investments I have over the last eight years have been managed by a blind trust.	1
ClaimBuster	10401	... we have made environments in schools healthier for kids, including healthier lunches...	1
ClaimBuster	10402	If it's a failing school, shut it down and reopen it under a new principal with a turnaround team of specialists the way Governor Jim Hunt does in North Carolina.	1
ClaimBuster	10403	I have been in charge of this reinventing government streamlining project that's reduced the size of government by more than 300,000 people in the last several years.	1
ClaimBuster	10404	I believe very deeply that you have to be willing to stand up and fight no matter what powerful forces might be on the other side.	0
ClaimBuster	10405	Well, thank you again, Bob.	0
ClaimBuster	10406	Even FOX News disputes it, and that doesn't happen very often when it comes to accusations about me.	1
ClaimBuster	10407	And there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening, and over the course of this month we're going to have two more presidential debates and a vice presidential debate.	1
ClaimBuster	10408	Now, somebody has to bear the responsibility for this.	0
ClaimBuster	10409	And if we're fiscally responsible and put America back to work, we're going to fix Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	10410	Mr. Nixon knows very well that in this - in this whole matter that's been involved with the so-called religious discussion in this campaign, I've never suggested, even by the vaguest implication, that he did anything but disapprove it.	1
ClaimBuster	10411	And I can assure you that the United States will have the leadership role in moving toward a comprehensive settlement of the Middle Eastern problems, I hope and trust as soon as possible.	0
ClaimBuster	10412	You implement that NAFTA, the Mexican trade agreement, where they pay people a dollar an hour, have no health care, no retirement, no pollution controls, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and you're going to hear a giant sucking sound of jobs being pulled out of this country right at a time when we need the tax base to pay the debt and pay down the interest on the debt and get our house back in order.	1
ClaimBuster	10413	We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make America safe again.	0
ClaimBuster	10414	It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.	1
ClaimBuster	10415	Thirdly, in 1952, there were only seven votes in favor of the admission of Red China into the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	10416	The second part is to maintain and improve relations with our friends to the south.	0
ClaimBuster	10417	And our alliance is strong.	0
ClaimBuster	10418	Our policies are very different.	0
ClaimBuster	10419	Let me just -- I've got to answer this.	0
ClaimBuster	10420	Today we're well on our way to a 600-ship navy.	1
ClaimBuster	10421	He indicates he would not make those.	0
ClaimBuster	10422	If you're paying $12, $13, $14 an hour for a factory worker, and you can move your factory south of the border, pay $1 an hour for labor, hire a young -- let's assume you've been in business for a long time.	0
ClaimBuster	10423	You're spending millions and millions of dollars in negative ads frightening senior citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	10424	But I'll respond to a couple of things that you mentioned.	0
ClaimBuster	10425	And that's the fundamental reason why we can't let the farmer go by himself at the present time.	0
ClaimBuster	10426	In the two-hundred-year history there's been a very uh - cautious approach to this.	0
ClaimBuster	10427	I don't agree with that statement.	0
ClaimBuster	10428	And how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also, how do we have enough revenue to make those investments?	0
ClaimBuster	10429	Let's take the example of Darfur just for a moment.	0
ClaimBuster	10430	Good, I look forward to it.	0
ClaimBuster	10431	What I criticized were the policies that made it necessary to go to Korea.	1
ClaimBuster	10432	There wouldn't be time for a President to decide; it would be decided by these remote computers.	0
ClaimBuster	10433	I reject this notion -- and I'm suggesting my opponent isn't -- I reject the notion that some say that if you're Muslim you can't free, you don't desire freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	10434	Decide who you think will do the job.	0
ClaimBuster	10435	And we control private and public health care costs.	1
ClaimBuster	10436	Secondly, we have to increase our exports, as compared with our imports.	0
ClaimBuster	10437	Now we need to focus on what do we need to do to be better off still.	0
ClaimBuster	10438	That has to be our biggest national security priority.	0
ClaimBuster	10439	We need moms and dads, helping to raise kids.	0
ClaimBuster	10440	We have gone from the biggest deficits eight years ago to the biggest surpluses in history today.	1
ClaimBuster	10441	I believe we ought to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund to -- with half the money going to states so states can make the right decisions for environmental quality.	0
ClaimBuster	10442	A lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy.	0
ClaimBuster	10443	But back then we had planes that couldn't fly for lack of spare parts or pilots.	1
ClaimBuster	10444	He says he's going to give you tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	10445	And they installed a Marxist-Leninist totalitarian government.	1
ClaimBuster	10446	He voted against these programs, he does not believe it.	1
ClaimBuster	10447	She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great.	1
ClaimBuster	10448	The best thing to do is to look at the record uh - of Mr. Ford's Administration and Mr. Nixon's before his.	0
ClaimBuster	10449	You know, last year up to this time, we've lost 700,000 jobs in America.	1
ClaimBuster	10450	So I favor closing the gun show loophole.	0
ClaimBuster	10451	I've said it before, I say it again: I believe the president broke faith with the American people in the way that he took this nation to war.	1
ClaimBuster	10452	It was not my administration that put the sanctions on Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	10453	I was against the war in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	10454	I do not agree with that point of view.	0
ClaimBuster	10455	We haven't gotten either the economies in Government that were promised; we haven't gotten the 4% inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of Mr. Carter's first term.	1
ClaimBuster	10456	It has doubled over the last eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	10457	Well, look at the budget.	0
ClaimBuster	10458	What troubles me is that when I talk of the voluntary sector and a thousand points of light and a thousand different ways to help on these problems, the man has just said he doesn't understand what I'm talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	10459	I remember driving down the California coast one day.	0
ClaimBuster	10460	When it comes to timetables it can't be the United States timetable as to how discussions take place.	0
ClaimBuster	10461	Number two, I believe that if any economic sanctions against Latin America are going to be successful they have to be multilateral.	0
ClaimBuster	10462	Matter of fact, we distributed free trigger locks in the State of Texas so that people can get them and put them on their guns to make their guns more safe.	1
ClaimBuster	10463	And people are beginning to educate through this program, teaching these kids you shouldn't use drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	10464	Well can I have the last word on this?	0
ClaimBuster	10465	The president reversed it publicly while the president of South Korea was here.	1
ClaimBuster	10466	I am simply saying that I believe that that's where the effort should be directed -- to make that determination.	0
ClaimBuster	10467	Now, we have come back from that abyss.	1
ClaimBuster	10468	Russia is still very unstable; they could go back to square one, and worse.	0
ClaimBuster	10469	The governor talked about Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	10470	I notice you bring that up a lot.	1
ClaimBuster	10471	It's one of the best schools in Houston.	1
ClaimBuster	10472	And we've cut them 18 times.	1
ClaimBuster	10473	But, I think that that is clearly related to the fact that, going back to the time when the all-volunteer Army was created in 1973 - and I worked hard for it and supported it - we simply have failed to keep pace with the cost of living.	1
ClaimBuster	10474	And I think that this problem has become so severe, as you know, that we're going to have to do something about home values.	0
ClaimBuster	10475	Well, I think age is very -- you know, wisdom comes from age, experience and intelligence.	0
ClaimBuster	10476	You cannot solve a problem unless you diagnose the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	10477	They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.	1
ClaimBuster	10478	If they had that money without those government restrictions, every one of them has told me they could make great savings and make far greater use of the money.	0
ClaimBuster	10479	You even brought some right-wing congressman into the White House to plot how to attack me for going to Russia in 1969-70, when over 50,000 other Americans did.	1
ClaimBuster	10480	And it's going to be tough.	0
ClaimBuster	10481	He's going to do -- and he would do for the US what he's done to Arkansas.	0
ClaimBuster	10482	But we have an employer-based system.	0
ClaimBuster	10483	John claims that he is making plain where the money will come from.	0
ClaimBuster	10484	Now, we have a choice here.	0
ClaimBuster	10485	I don't think in racial harmony that I'm a laggard on that.	0
ClaimBuster	10486	For the first four years -- it takes a year to pass it and for the first four years only the poor are covered.	1
ClaimBuster	10487	And the reason it's that important is that all of the other issues, whether prescription drugs for all seniors that are opposed by the drug companies or the patient's bill of rights to take the decisions away from the HMOs and give them to the doctors and nurses, opposed by the HMOs and insurance companies, all these other proposals are going to be a lot easier to get passed for the American people if we limit the influence of special interest money and give democracy back to the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	10488	We've got to put our house in order.	0
ClaimBuster	10489	And they'll gridlock right at that point because for example, we've got international competitors who simply could not unload their cars off the ships if they had to comply -- you see, if it was a 2-way street, just couldn't do it.	1
ClaimBuster	10490	Nobody's ever seen numbers like this for health care.	1
ClaimBuster	10491	The individual who wants to start a business or expand his business as a black businessman is able to borrow, either directly or with guaranteed loans.	1
ClaimBuster	10492	It's about where we are now.	0
ClaimBuster	10493	That's Social Security and Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	10494	And you ought to have some of this surplus so you can save and dream and build.	0
ClaimBuster	10495	I don't believe that the Rumanians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	10496	And what's happening is the level of pollution is increasing significantly.	1
ClaimBuster	10497	I have had a chance to work with him and Alan Greenspan and others on the crisis following the collapse of the Mexican peso.	1
ClaimBuster	10498	We should have taken a leading role, not militarily, but a leading role organizationally, governmentally to bring together the parties; to find responsible parties.	0
ClaimBuster	10499	If you change your job, you're going to be covered.	1
ClaimBuster	10500	So my view is the middle class is the -- they've been suffering, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	10501	And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that's what you're getting with her.	0
ClaimBuster	10502	The second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas.	1
ClaimBuster	10503	I have a plan to let you buy into the same health care senators and congressmen give themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	10504	And I will address you as Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	10505	We made the embargo tougher but we increased contacts people to people with the Cubans, including direct telephone service, which was largely supported by the Cuban-American community.	1
ClaimBuster	10506	We can't get involved in the quagmire, but we must do what we can.	0
ClaimBuster	10507	And I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you.	0
ClaimBuster	10508	This is an arms escalation.	0
ClaimBuster	10509	I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office.	1
ClaimBuster	10510	And I'm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	10511	... as he has campaigned for me around the country, you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America.	1
ClaimBuster	10512	The average family is paying an additional $900 a year in higher premiums because of the uninsured.	1
ClaimBuster	10513	And when the Vice President talks about liberals on the Bench, I wonder who he's talking about?	0
ClaimBuster	10514	We need to stop this proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	10515	They're all patriots but you've got to link arms and work with them.	0
ClaimBuster	10516	Senator McCain is proposing -- and this is a fundamental difference between us -- $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	10517	I agree with everything she said.	0
ClaimBuster	10518	And I don't believe that Arab countries will pursue it when we have a strong president who will protect the integrity of our country, the commitment of our Constitution and Bill of Rights and protect people in this country who happen to be Jews.	0
ClaimBuster	10519	You don't guarantee they get the job.	0
ClaimBuster	10520	I didn't hear any comment from Governor Reagan about what he would do to stop or reduce terrorism in the future.	1
ClaimBuster	10521	I just have to say something.	0
ClaimBuster	10522	I was an altar boy.	1
ClaimBuster	10523	And I think we know what they are: a good strong future, a future in which there is opportunity for all of our citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	10524	Now, you've got to have a government that comes from you again.	0
ClaimBuster	10525	I say on balance it does more good than harm if, if we can get some protection for the environment so that the Mexicans have to follow their own environmental standards, their own labor law standards, and if we have a genuine commitment to reeducate and retrain the American workers who lose their jobs and reinvest in this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	10526	And he used to tell me things that I knew were not quite accurate.	0
ClaimBuster	10527	He was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of Baghdad, Matthew Stanley, before Christmas last year.	1
ClaimBuster	10528	The military will be an all-volunteer army.	0
ClaimBuster	10529	My plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	10530	We do need tougher sanctions.	0
ClaimBuster	10531	We ought to pursue strategies with each of them, economic and the rest, that help them pull away from their dependence upon the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	10532	They started from that little area, and now they're in 32 different nations, Hillary.	1
ClaimBuster	10533	Well, first of all, I gave him the benefit of the doubt on the house deal.	0
ClaimBuster	10534	I don't have a free reserved parking place at Natl Airport, why should my servants?	1
ClaimBuster	10535	The Oregon plan made some good sense, but it's easy to dismiss the concerns of the disabled.	0
ClaimBuster	10536	My problem with Governor Clinton, once again, is that one time he's gonna make up his mind, he sees some merit in it, but then he sees a lot of things wrong with it.	0
ClaimBuster	10537	Have a 3rd task force on new industries of the future to make sure we nail those for our country and they don't wind up in Europe and Asia.	0
ClaimBuster	10538	... by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it.	0
ClaimBuster	10539	More and more women are being elected.	1
ClaimBuster	10540	I think Government has a responsibility to find jobs for the youth of this country, and that the place to start is to assist in the very important and necessary task of helping cities rebuild.	0
ClaimBuster	10541	This is a deviation from idealism; it's a deviation from a commitment to our major ally in the Middle East, which is Israel; it's a yielding to economic pressure on the part of the Arabs on the oil issue; and it's also a tremendous indication that under the Ford administration we have not addressed the energy policy adequately.	0
ClaimBuster	10542	Nobody is going to follow somebody who doesn't believe we can succeed and with somebody who says that war where we are is a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	10543	So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	10544	And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals.	1
ClaimBuster	10545	And finally, we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded.	0
ClaimBuster	10546	There is much to be done.	0
ClaimBuster	10547	And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.	0
ClaimBuster	10548	I think Kenne- Senator Kennedy is wrong on three counts.	0
ClaimBuster	10549	And I think immediately following the Republican Convention, there was about a ten-point spread.	1
ClaimBuster	10550	No, no, I had a question and the question was how much did you cut them by?	0
ClaimBuster	10551	I've traveled the last twenty-one months among the people of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	10552	I appreciate that very much.	0
ClaimBuster	10553	It doesn't accommodate the expenditures that he calls for, for accelerated development and deployment of a new manned strategic bomber, for a permanent fleet in the Indian Ocean, for the restoration of the fleet to 600 ships, to the development and deployment of a dedicated modern aircraft interceptor.	1
ClaimBuster	10554	Uh - a job, a home for all those that'll work and save for it, uh - safety in the streets, uh - health that is a - health care that is affordable.	0
ClaimBuster	10555	Since I've got about 20 seconds, let me just say one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	10556	We hear all the negatives.	0
ClaimBuster	10557	They went -- they quadrupled their nuclear capacity.	1
ClaimBuster	10558	What it says is that gays and lesbians can't be fired from their job because they're gay or lesbian.	1
ClaimBuster	10559	That's why I believe there are going to be millions of Democrats that are going to vote with us this time around, because they too want that promise kept.	0
ClaimBuster	10560	We ought to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.	0
ClaimBuster	10561	And thanks to this great general, David Petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they have succeeded.	0
ClaimBuster	10562	There's even an Apple store in China that's a counterfeit Apple store, selling counterfeit goods.	1
ClaimBuster	10563	I spent my life in the private sector, not in government.	1
ClaimBuster	10564	And when I'm president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely.	0
ClaimBuster	10565	And it's not just about women.	0
ClaimBuster	10566	I think we have a real obligation, obviously public officials.	0
ClaimBuster	10567	There are hundreds of thousands of them.	1
ClaimBuster	10568	What about the prices you pay?	0
ClaimBuster	10569	Once it's a drug, does it apply only to teenagers or everybody in America?	0
ClaimBuster	10570	I think that we do.	0
ClaimBuster	10571	Now, I'm concerned that the path that we're on has just been unsuccessful.	0
ClaimBuster	10572	I would have to see what they wanted to do, but I don't believe that will be the request.	0
ClaimBuster	10573	We've got to fix our energy policy that's giving our wealth away.	0
ClaimBuster	10574	We had 25 fighter wings.	1
ClaimBuster	10575	What I've called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	10576	It's the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	10577	And we're all proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	10578	Both of these, I think, would respond to the proper kind of incentives that we could offer these people.	0
ClaimBuster	10579	We're going to do it by taking full advantage of oil, coal, gas, nuclear and our renewables.	0
ClaimBuster	10580	I will never stand for a reduction of the Social Security benefits to the people that are now getting them.	0
ClaimBuster	10581	Osama bin Laden attacked us.	1
ClaimBuster	10582	If you think that was good, then you do.	0
ClaimBuster	10583	He just said he wants everybody to be able to buy in to the same plan that senators and congressmen get.	0
ClaimBuster	10584	I know that we can grow manufacturing jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	10585	And my opponent has got a plan of retreat and defeat in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	10586	And all that raises revenue.	1
ClaimBuster	10587	Let me step back and talk about what I think our mission has to be in the Middle East and even more broadly, because our purpose is to make sure the world is more -- is peaceful.	0
ClaimBuster	10588	And he is leaving office with a popularity at an all-time high, because American people	1
ClaimBuster	10589	I have no intention of wilting.	0
ClaimBuster	10590	They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years.	0
ClaimBuster	10591	So, I vetoed it because of a loss of jobs and because it would've interfered with our energy independence program.	1
ClaimBuster	10592	They're suffering in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	10593	They're tomorrow's industries in the inner cities.	0
ClaimBuster	10594	And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way.	0
ClaimBuster	10595	I'm asking for your vote.	0
ClaimBuster	10596	It's time for a fresh start after a season of cynicism.	0
ClaimBuster	10597	The administration deserves credit for having made it work.	0
ClaimBuster	10598	The next thing is to try to get more entrepreneurship in business within the reach of minorities so that these businesses are located in the communities in which they're found.	0
ClaimBuster	10599	He testified, and these are his words - the present governor of Georgia - he says he found the Medicaid program in Georgia in shambles.	1
ClaimBuster	10600	I shouldn't have a preference.	0
ClaimBuster	10601	That's not what I think.	0
ClaimBuster	10602	But as Admiral Yarnell has said, and he's been supported by most military authority, these islands that we're now talking about are not worth the bones of a single American soldier; and I know how difficult it is to sustain troops close to the shore under artillery bombardment.	1
ClaimBuster	10603	But -- OK. All right.	0
ClaimBuster	10604	I'm shocked to hear that.	0
ClaimBuster	10605	And part of what we need to do, what the next president has to do -- and this is part of our judgment, this is part of how we're going to keep America safe -- is to -- to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education, we are going to invest in issues that -- that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams.	0
ClaimBuster	10606	And what the president said about the tax cuts has been wiped out by the increase in health care, the increase in gasoline, the increase in tuitions, the increase in prescription drugs.	1
ClaimBuster	10607	I think it is respecting life to reach for that cure.	0
ClaimBuster	10608	But unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it.	0
ClaimBuster	10609	Why not try to help them with my small business program to build some incentives into the system?	0
ClaimBuster	10610	I think we ought to raise the age at which juveniles can have a gun.	0
ClaimBuster	10611	Bob, Mr. President, folks at Lynn University, good to be with you.	0
ClaimBuster	10612	He was hoping we'd turn away.	0
ClaimBuster	10613	I started doing these formats a year ago in New Hampshire and I found that we had huge crowds because all I did was let people ask questions and I tried to give very specific answers.	1
ClaimBuster	10614	Because you know, in the first debate, Mr. Bush made some news.	1
ClaimBuster	10615	There are inspections that are very intrusive.	0
ClaimBuster	10616	Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders.	1
ClaimBuster	10617	He voted for nearly a billion dollars in pork barrel earmark projects, including, by the way, $3 million for an overhead projector at a planetarium in Chicago, Illinois.	1
ClaimBuster	10618	There are certainly dangers there, there are certainly other trouble spots in the world which are closer to Europe than to the US.	0
ClaimBuster	10619	For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.	1
ClaimBuster	10620	It will be good for our economy and it will be good for job creation.	0
ClaimBuster	10621	The bottom line of national strength is that the President must be in command, he must lead.	0
ClaimBuster	10622	And I think tonight, as we contrast for the first time our differing approach to government, to values, to the leadership in this country, I think as this debate goes forward, the American people will have for the first time a chance to weigh the two of us against each other.	0
ClaimBuster	10623	And what was the cost?	0
ClaimBuster	10624	You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia.	0
ClaimBuster	10625	I don't intend to see to it that the United States is ever in a position where, while we're negotiating with the Soviet Union, that we discontinue our intelligence effort.	0
ClaimBuster	10626	He believes in nation building.	0
ClaimBuster	10627	The killing and tragedies had taken place.	1
ClaimBuster	10628	It's not an accurate one at all.	0
ClaimBuster	10629	We don't have to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	10630	I'm not proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	10631	Look, I'll sit down with anybody, but there's got to be pre-conditions.	0
ClaimBuster	10632	We want to work with the Russians.	0
ClaimBuster	10633	If you have -- if you squander the surplus on a huge tax cut that goes mostly to those at the top, then you can't make education the top priority.	0
ClaimBuster	10634	When I ran for president, I said we'd cut the deficit in half in four years; we cut it by 60 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	10635	Whether it be on fighting the pharmaceutical companies on Medicare prescription drugs, importation.	0
ClaimBuster	10636	We got to start moving them toward full citizenship, out of the shadows.	0
ClaimBuster	10637	One thing about insurance, that's a Washington term.	0
ClaimBuster	10638	Every time Mr. Ford speaks from a position of secrecy in negotiations, in secret - in secret treaties that've been uh - pursued and achieved, in supporting dictatorships, in ignoring human rights, we are weak and the rest of the world knows it.	0
ClaimBuster	10639	It's not going to happen overnight; it certainly will have to happen on a step-by-step basis as we make progress in arms negotiation and arms control and arms reduction.	0
ClaimBuster	10640	You know, because it sounds like you're in the business or you're aware of people in the business -- you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent.	1
ClaimBuster	10641	I've got three part- time jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	10642	I'm not talking about leaving.	0
ClaimBuster	10643	So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues.	0
ClaimBuster	10644	Start asking the question, what do you know?	0
ClaimBuster	10645	I would not be able wou- would be willing to meet with him however, unless there were preparations for that conference which would give us some reasonable certainty - some reasonable certainty - that you were going to have some success.	0
ClaimBuster	10646	We're not going to be able to be everywhere all the time.	0
ClaimBuster	10647	It is actually a disagreement between us, a national law that is pending on this, the Dingle-Norwood bill, a bipartisan bill, is one that I support and that the governor does not.	1
ClaimBuster	10648	The president's characterization of my tax plan...	0
ClaimBuster	10649	And I think it -- you know, it's a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	10650	I said many foolish things back in those days.	0
ClaimBuster	10651	Let me say in my case, if I'm out of work, I'll cut grass tomorrow to take care of my family; I'll be happy to make shoes, I'll be happy to make clothing, I'll make sausage.	0
ClaimBuster	10652	As a matter of fact, that committee under Secretary Hills released about a seventy-five-page report with specific recommendations so we can do a better job uh - the weeks ahead.	1
ClaimBuster	10653	I don't believe that our relative strength is increasing.	0
ClaimBuster	10654	Uh - I think Senator Dole would show more good judgment and discretion than to so describe uh - a heroic and brave and very outstanding leader of the military.	0
ClaimBuster	10655	Under Vice President Gore's plan, they get $145 of tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	10656	Go back to work at 30,000 bucks a month representing some other country.	0
ClaimBuster	10657	I don't believe that Mr. Mondale has a plan for balancing the budget; he has a plan for raising taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	10658	And I introduced the first legislation, and we forced votes on it.	1
ClaimBuster	10659	Now, we're sitting down and talking to the Soviets about strategic arms, and he wants to do away with the Midgetman and the MX, the modernization or our nuclear capability.	0
ClaimBuster	10660	And it is absolutely critical that we understand this is not just a challenge, it's an opportunity, because if we create a new energy economy, we can create five million new jobs, easily, here in the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	10661	The issue of abortion is a very difficult issue, one that I think that we all have to wrestle with, we have to come to terms with.	0
ClaimBuster	10662	In fact, he went on to say... WALLACE: Her two minutes -- sir, her two minutes.	0
ClaimBuster	10663	And I'm looking forward to having that debate.	0
ClaimBuster	10664	And I will not cut our military budget by a trillion dollars, which is a combination of the budget cuts the president has, as well as the sequestration cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	10665	Well, the red light went on.	0
ClaimBuster	10666	I will fight to create more energy in this country, to get America energy secure.	0
ClaimBuster	10667	Mr. Bush is trying to run against Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter and everybody in the world but me in this race.	0
ClaimBuster	10668	Let me point out again that his Congress - the Democratic Congress - has cut eighty million dollars off of the Voice of America appropriations.	1
ClaimBuster	10669	Unless there was a severe recession - and after all the worst unbalanced budget in history was in 1958, twelve billion dollars - larger than in any Administration in the history of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	10670	I think what the FBI did and what the Department of Justice did, including meeting with her husband, the attorney general, in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in Arizona, I think it's disgraceful.	1
ClaimBuster	10671	We can compete with anyone in the world as long as the playing field is level.	0
ClaimBuster	10672	And instead of retreating -- instead of being strong where we should be strong, he wants to make it strong and intervene in the most private and personal questions in American life.	0
ClaimBuster	10673	There are three fundamental challenges.	0
ClaimBuster	10674	And finally, we ought to be promoting the democratic impulses around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	10675	If the objective body rules on your behalf, the insurance company must follow those rules.	0
ClaimBuster	10676	The record in handling them has been very good during this Administration.	0
ClaimBuster	10677	I have been in the cabinet.	1
ClaimBuster	10678	I've never wilted in my life.	1
ClaimBuster	10679	But we're not there yet.	0
ClaimBuster	10680	We had a difference on the timetable.	1
ClaimBuster	10681	I strongly believe that one of the best things to encourage parental involvement also is to know that the classrooms will be safe and secure.	0
ClaimBuster	10682	I've gotten a lot of good experience in dealing with ordinary people over the last year and month.	0
ClaimBuster	10683	But I hope you won't take my five seconds away from me.	0
ClaimBuster	10684	They sacrifice, they give everything for America.	0
ClaimBuster	10685	Already many people see the strange weather conditions that the old timers say they've never seen before in their lifetimes.	1
ClaimBuster	10686	That's the plan for victory.	0
ClaimBuster	10687	It can't get any worse.	0
ClaimBuster	10688	We now are planning to continue the revitalization program with increased commitments of rapid transit, mass transit.	0
ClaimBuster	10689	In the same way that we should enforce rules against China manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper.	0
ClaimBuster	10690	All of our children have gone to both public schools and private schools.	1
ClaimBuster	10691	I know that's a controversial view, but I do believe it's a deterrent.	0
ClaimBuster	10692	I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me.	1
ClaimBuster	10693	We can give you all these numbers, they don't mean a thing.	0
ClaimBuster	10694	And I want to call a hemispheric summit just as soon after the 20th of January as possible to fight that war.	0
ClaimBuster	10695	I don't care what it is -- competitiveness, health care, crime, you name it.	0
ClaimBuster	10696	I hear from teachers all the time about the lawsuits and the threats, respect in the classroom.	0
ClaimBuster	10697	But it didn't stop him from endorsing the sale of arms to the Ayatollah.	0
ClaimBuster	10698	I want to rebuild our military to keep the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	10699	You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail.	0
ClaimBuster	10700	We should come to its defense.	0
ClaimBuster	10701	60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers have been denied handguns.	1
ClaimBuster	10702	I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America.	0
ClaimBuster	10703	This is typical of his long-standing inclination, on the use of American power, not to resolve disputes diplomatically and peacefully, but to show that the exercise of military power is best proven by the actual use of it.	0
ClaimBuster	10704	I believe they want to.	0
ClaimBuster	10705	Proud that they voted for the right candidate.	0
ClaimBuster	10706	We've had a 25% reduction since the first year I was in office.	1
ClaimBuster	10707	This is a time when bin Laden was still out, and now they've reconstituted themselves.	1
ClaimBuster	10708	The Secretary of Defense himself said it would be a suicide mission if it were built.	1
ClaimBuster	10709	Isn't the real question is will we be better off?	0
ClaimBuster	10710	We're giving them lots of money, lots of everything.	1
ClaimBuster	10711	And we're retaining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow.	1
ClaimBuster	10712	We could have done that in Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	10713	I believe that younger workers ought to be allowed to take some of their own money and put it in a personal savings account, because I understand that they need to get better rates of return than the rates of return being given in the current Social Security trust.	0
ClaimBuster	10714	Well, let's look at the president's policies, all right, as opposed to the rhetoric, because we've had four years of policies being played out.	0
ClaimBuster	10715	And Jack Kemp and I want to share with you some ideas tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	10716	I have a plan to provide health care to all Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	10717	Now, the other day, Mr. Bush said, Ã¢â€°Â¥Well, if we continue with Star War-Star Wars-we have to cut some place.Ã¢â€°Â¤ He hasn't told us where.	1
ClaimBuster	10718	We have to bring back our workers.	0
ClaimBuster	10719	And let me say again, Detroit is rearing to go on that.	0
ClaimBuster	10720	We're providing that young woman with help.	0
ClaimBuster	10721	If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there's nothing in my opinion that America can't do.	0
ClaimBuster	10722	In the hands of a terrorist enemy.	0
ClaimBuster	10723	I think this is a great example.	0
ClaimBuster	10724	Senator Bentsen and I have a plan for the 1990Ãâ‚¬s and beyond.	0
ClaimBuster	10725	But I know this, we have serious financial problems in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	10726	We're going to tell you how to do it all.	0
ClaimBuster	10727	I accept his objective and his dream; we all do.	0
ClaimBuster	10728	Do you know we don't have a single program sponsored by our government to Cuba - to tell them our story, to tell them that we are their friends, that we want them to be free again?	1
ClaimBuster	10729	I will balance the budget every year.	0
ClaimBuster	10730	There will be people with experience and people who understand America and people who've made it and know the hard knocks in life.	0
ClaimBuster	10731	It's why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had -- had the plan.	1
ClaimBuster	10732	Well, the people need it, that's the point.	0
ClaimBuster	10733	The one thing I'm for is a safe society.	0
ClaimBuster	10734	They don't want us talking about each other.	0
ClaimBuster	10735	Do we really want those decisions made by judges who've been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty?	0
ClaimBuster	10736	And what I'm concerned about is that if we continue with the policies that Mr. Bush is talking about here this evening, the flexible freeze somebody described it the other day as a kind of economic slurpee he wants to spend billions on virtually every weapons system around.	0
ClaimBuster	10737	That's no way to treat somebody who's courageous and brave, that is trying to lead his country forward.	0
ClaimBuster	10738	The Surgeon General is doing a good job in encouraging the proper kind of education.	0
ClaimBuster	10739	But the exciting thing is, the fear of nuclear war is down.	0
ClaimBuster	10740	And so I think it's about time we get this Noriega matter in perspective.	0
ClaimBuster	10741	I want to see rural redevelopment and I have been out front in favor of alternate sources of energy and one of them is gasohol and comes from using your corn and I think we can do better in terms of biodegradable for a lot of product, so I'm optimistic about the agricultural economy.	0
ClaimBuster	10742	You know, back after World War II when we had hundreds of thousands of GIs who came back from the war, we didn't sit around.	1
ClaimBuster	10743	That's the analysis of economists who have looked at this.	1
ClaimBuster	10744	Two-thirds of our jobs come from small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	10745	It means our goods aren't as competitive and we lose jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	10746	With decent and affordable housing that our people can buy and own and live in, so that we end the shame of hopelessness in America.	0
ClaimBuster	10747	I know it made a lot of difference many times in the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	10748	I believe in the transformational power of liberty.	0
ClaimBuster	10749	If affirmative action means quotas, I'm against it.	0
ClaimBuster	10750	I have a winning temperament.	0
ClaimBuster	10751	That means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who re-enlisted in Baghdad, just like the mother I met at the airport the other day whose son was killed.	1
ClaimBuster	10752	The resolution commits the president in the United States, which I supported, to defend uh - Formosa, the Pescadores, and if it was his military judgment, these islands.	1
ClaimBuster	10753	And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car.	0
ClaimBuster	10754	But let me start with what you said.	0
ClaimBuster	10755	... the long-term health care drivers.	0
ClaimBuster	10756	So these are three programs which are quite moderate.	0
ClaimBuster	10757	It was President Bush that wrote the first checks.	1
ClaimBuster	10758	So I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	10759	You don't say that out loud.	0
ClaimBuster	10760	And the greatest resource of all are the two hundred and fifteen million Americans who have within us the strength, the character, the intelligence, the experience, the patriotism, the idealism, the compassion, the sense of brotherhood on which we can rely in the future to restore the greatness to our country We ought not to be excluded from our government anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	10761	That is a very serious charge against the president.	0
ClaimBuster	10762	Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they're taking our wealth.	1
ClaimBuster	10763	And so I just feel this is where I'm coming from.	0
ClaimBuster	10764	But again, the test or the difference between us, the president has had four years to try to do something about it, and North Korea has got more weapons; Iran is moving towards weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	10765	And when and if -- and it's not going to happen, because you have Russia and you have Iran now.	0
ClaimBuster	10766	And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job.	0
ClaimBuster	10767	We're going to tax -- cut taxes and balance the budget.	0
ClaimBuster	10768	The other night Governor Clinton raised my -- I don't know if you saw the debate the other night.	0
ClaimBuster	10769	He talks about all the jobs he's created in one or 2 years.	1
ClaimBuster	10770	Well, no, but the point is that's a subjective thing.	0
ClaimBuster	10771	And this was the spot at which President Carter had promised that he was going to bring in a vast program to rebuild this department.	1
ClaimBuster	10772	So she wants to fight.	0
ClaimBuster	10773	Canada's tax rate on companies is now 15 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	10774	Maybe you don't go out to dinner as much.	0
ClaimBuster	10775	And the last president of the United States that tried that was Herbert Hoover, and we went from a deep recession into a depression.	1
ClaimBuster	10776	And when we do things like that -- when we bring those who have harmed us to justice, that sends a message to the world and it tells Peyton (ph) that we did not forget her father.	0
ClaimBuster	10777	Is that the way it works?	0
ClaimBuster	10778	I think you have to tell the pharmaceutical companies they can't keep raising drug prices at three times the rate of inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	10779	He -- he aligned with Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	10780	Number one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition.	1
ClaimBuster	10781	It is new and it is very very different than what's happened, but it's not quite ready to be totally implemented.	0
ClaimBuster	10782	Government always needs the money it gets.	0
ClaimBuster	10783	And I think it's very important to the United States, obviously, to have a working relationship that is good.	0
ClaimBuster	10784	But you've been -- but you've been president four years...	1
ClaimBuster	10785	Is it true that, as far as this country is concerned, in the field of electric power, in all of the fields that he has mentioned, we have not been moving ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	10786	I think of those young athletes who represented us at the Olympics were tremendously impressive.	0
ClaimBuster	10787	Now, the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	10788	That's an example of an unfair burden sharing.	0
ClaimBuster	10789	On a per-person basis, it did cut way below the rate of inflation in medical costs.	1
ClaimBuster	10790	My judgment is that the Republican party has stood still here in the United States, and it's also stood still around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	10791	So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.	0
ClaimBuster	10792	Now, I think we ought to try to help families and see if it will do what I think -- make all schools better.	0
ClaimBuster	10793	Senator Obama suspended those requests for pork-barrel projects after he was running for president of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	10794	My judgment is that the program the Vice President put forward, which is an extension of Mr. Benson's program, will cost a billion dollars more than the present program, which costs about six billion dollars a year, the most expensive in history.	1
ClaimBuster	10795	Would we be better off as I believe, working together to give each other the tools we need to make the most of our God-given potential, or are we better off saying, you're on your own?	0
ClaimBuster	10796	I got him to give the birth certificate.	1
ClaimBuster	10797	Well, I think it starts with Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	10798	And if we lose our will, we lose.	0
ClaimBuster	10799	We're on a different system.	1
ClaimBuster	10800	We will not have open borders.	0
ClaimBuster	10801	And I am going to continue to defend my record and defend my propositions against what I think are exaggerations.	0
ClaimBuster	10802	Four years ago I ran for president at a time of high unemployment and rising frustration.	1
ClaimBuster	10803	We want to be stronger.	0
ClaimBuster	10804	I gave, in September of 1974, an opportunity for all draft evaders, all deserters, to come in voluntarily, clear their records by earning an opportunity to restore their good citizenship.	1
ClaimBuster	10805	I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America.	0
ClaimBuster	10806	And today, on the average, the average serviceman is at least 15% - and I happen to think that's a very modest estimate - 15% below what has happened to the cost of living over that period of time.	1
ClaimBuster	10807	We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	10808	I don't see how you can win in Iraq if you don't believe we should be there in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	10809	He didn't tell you that he vetoed a middle class tax cut because it would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy and vetoed an investment tax credit paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy.	1
ClaimBuster	10810	I've been in politics a long time, and I don't remember that kind of piling on, that kind of ugly rumor that never was true, printed.	0
ClaimBuster	10811	And we also have important domestic priorities, in education and housing and health care, in economic development, in job training, in the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	10812	I'll stand on my record on that.	0
ClaimBuster	10813	I'm also going to dramatically expand trade in Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	10814	This weakens the chances of civilization to survive.	0
ClaimBuster	10815	We need a president who stays deadly focused on the real war on terror.	0
ClaimBuster	10816	I don't believe in Constitutional Amendments that would interfere with that.	0
ClaimBuster	10817	The Philippines -- we've got help -- we're helping them there to bring -- to bring Al Qaida affiliates to justice there.	1
ClaimBuster	10818	And so we have a fundamental difference on this one.	0
ClaimBuster	10819	The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	10820	... 17 intelligence -- do you doubt 17 military and civilian...	0
ClaimBuster	10821	And you do have experience.	0
ClaimBuster	10822	It's a strategy that will succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	10823	And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again.	1
ClaimBuster	10824	The amnesty program that I recommended in Chicago in September of 1974 would give to all draft evaders and - uh military deserters the opportunity to earn their uh - good record back.	1
ClaimBuster	10825	And I just described -- I just described to you, Mr. President -- I just described to you precisely how I'd do it which is with a single number that people can put -- and they can put they're -- they're deductions and credits...	0
ClaimBuster	10826	And incidentally, Mel Carnahan in Missouri had the finest record on diversity in any governor in the entire history of the State of Missouri.	1
ClaimBuster	10827	Thank you, and good night.	0
ClaimBuster	10828	And to make sure our society is as hopeful as it possibly can be, every single child in America must be educated.	0
ClaimBuster	10829	On the question of the cost of our budget, I have stated that it's my best judgment that our agricultural program will cost a billion and a half, possibly two billion dollars less than the present agricultural program.	1
ClaimBuster	10830	That, I think, is a mistake and I think that this is a fundamental difference in our campaign and how we would approach health care.	0
ClaimBuster	10831	Some sophisticates think it may be a little gimmicky.	0
ClaimBuster	10832	I strongly support new accountability, so does Governor Bush.	0
ClaimBuster	10833	Roughly a hundred billion to a hundred and a quarter billion of that is the result of government activity.	1
ClaimBuster	10834	It's an election about the course of America.	0
ClaimBuster	10835	But as occurred at the end of the con- Democratic Convention, the Republican Party unified itself.	1
ClaimBuster	10836	He should have produced it a long time before.	0
ClaimBuster	10837	In 20 days, you will help decide who will lead this country into the next century.	1
ClaimBuster	10838	There has been too much government secrecy and not uh - not enough respect for the personal privacy of American citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	10839	Well, Sander, that's a good question, and the answer is: for 40-some years we kept the peace.	1
ClaimBuster	10840	Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago?	0
ClaimBuster	10841	And it's widely reported that drones are being used in drone strikes, and I support that and entirely, and feel the president was right to up the usage of that technology, and believe that we should continue to use it, to continue to go after the people that represent a threat to this nation and to our friends.	1
ClaimBuster	10842	We'll do everything we can to improve adoption in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	10843	They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.	0
ClaimBuster	10844	But I respect the presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	10845	My intentions are to earn your vote and earn your confidence.	0
ClaimBuster	10846	That, in my view, is making -- is making our future less certain and less secure.	0
ClaimBuster	10847	And furthermore, under this administration, spending has increased more than it has in the last 20 years and he asked Congress to spend more money than it actually spent.	1
ClaimBuster	10848	I don't think they ought to be held guilty.	0
ClaimBuster	10849	Highest private home ownership ever, but I'll make you one promise here.	1
ClaimBuster	10850	It's mortgaging our children's future.	0
ClaimBuster	10851	"Do you have what it takes?"""	0
ClaimBuster	10852	Well, wait, but it's very important.	0
ClaimBuster	10853	Mr. Bush, I don't question your patriotism.	0
ClaimBuster	10854	To do that, a President must know what is essential to command and to leadership and to strength.	0
ClaimBuster	10855	Mr. Mondale, I'm going to hang in there.	0
ClaimBuster	10856	I'm sorry, Jim, I'm going to stop the subsidy to PBS.	0
ClaimBuster	10857	Will the Congo go Communist?	0
ClaimBuster	10858	I am for equal rights, and while you have been in office for four ears and not one single state - and most f them have a majority of Democratic legislators - has added to the ratification r voted to ratify the equal rights amendment.	1
ClaimBuster	10859	We're going to go right back to what we had under Mr. Truman when he had political control of the Federal Reserve Board.	1
ClaimBuster	10860	But we can make a difference in terms ensuring that every young person in America, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, have a chance to succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	10861	We've had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	10862	Because when there are elections, people tend to vote for peace.	0
ClaimBuster	10863	No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too.	1
ClaimBuster	10864	We have gone from a triple-dip recession during the previous 12 years to a tripling of the stock market.	1
ClaimBuster	10865	And it seems to me with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers, and with more money in the hands of business to expand, to modernize, to provide more jobs, our economy stimulated so that we'll get more revenue and we'll have a more prosperous economy.	0
ClaimBuster	10866	Well, again, while you were on the board of the Woods Foundation, you and Mr. Ayers, together, you sent $230,000 to ACORN.	1
ClaimBuster	10867	$716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we weren't overpaying providers.	1
ClaimBuster	10868	I've been President now for almost four years.	1
ClaimBuster	10869	Maybe I'm missing something here.	0
ClaimBuster	10870	The Natl Women's Political Caucus gave me an award, one of their Good Guy Awards, for my involvement of women in high levels of government, and I've appointed more minorities to positions of high level in government than all the governors in the history of my state combined, before me.	1
ClaimBuster	10871	Not -- well, we turned over 35,000, so...	1
ClaimBuster	10872	And we are winning in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	10873	We knew he hated us.	0
ClaimBuster	10874	But let me just say the American Hospital Association said that the budget I vetoed could have closed 700 hospitals.	1
ClaimBuster	10875	And I did stop them, I admit that.	1
ClaimBuster	10876	I think Congress is hungry for someone who will work with them instead of manipulate them.	0
ClaimBuster	10877	And so, the terrorist acts began and led to the one great tragedy when they were killed in that suicide bombing of the building.	1
ClaimBuster	10878	During the 1990s, we had pay-as-you-go rules.	1
ClaimBuster	10879	We might have had some differences, and we had a lot of debates...	1
ClaimBuster	10880	We remember what it was like when we had a spending president and a spending Congress, and interest rates -- who remembers that?	0
ClaimBuster	10881	He says he's not going to raise taxes, though he has broken that pledge repeatedly.	1
ClaimBuster	10882	I think we ought to get at it.	0
ClaimBuster	10883	How do we protect our people?	0
ClaimBuster	10884	You know, she's given it to us.	0
ClaimBuster	10885	Most Americans believe in basic values.	0
ClaimBuster	10886	The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall.	1
ClaimBuster	10887	I think it's been a very constructive debate and I hope it's helped to acquaint the American people with the sharp differences between myself and Governor Reagan.	0
ClaimBuster	10888	That wouldn't have stopped if we hadn't been willing wouldn't have even started, the Soviets coming out, if we hadn't even been willing to support the freedom fighters there.	0
ClaimBuster	10889	I think it's worth it, because I think -- I know in the long term a free Iraq, a free Afghanistan, will set such a powerful example in a part of the world that's desperate for freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	10890	I doubt very much that Dan Quayle was the best qualified person for that job.	0
ClaimBuster	10891	But everybody's affected by the debt because of the tremendous interest that goes into paying on that debt everything's more expensive.	0
ClaimBuster	10892	And we believe China can be a partner, but we're also sending a very clear signal that America is a Pacific power; that we are going to have a presence there.	0
ClaimBuster	10893	This was the president's plan.	1
ClaimBuster	10894	And that same strategy will be employed in Afghanistan by this great general.	0
ClaimBuster	10895	Somebody, you know, maybe your son, maybe your grandson, maybe somebody else.	0
ClaimBuster	10896	We love you, and we're grateful to you for everything that you've given to us.	0
ClaimBuster	10897	It's a lonely job, but with the involvement of the American people in the process, with an open Government, the job is a very gratifying one.	0
ClaimBuster	10898	This commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our nation in the future, because with the windfall profits tax as a base, we now have an opportunity to use American technology and American ability and American natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels, yes; to expand rapidly the production of solar energy, yes; and also to produce the traditional kinds of American energy.	0
ClaimBuster	10899	Every parent out there has much less worry that their kids are going to be faced with nuclear holocaust.	0
ClaimBuster	10900	And that they are bad, and we ought to do something about them, and we ought to support housing legislation which this Administration has opposed.	0
ClaimBuster	10901	There needs to be more community health clinics where the poor can go get health care.	0
ClaimBuster	10902	Number two, change the tax code.	0
ClaimBuster	10903	As to Ferdinand Marcos, he isn't there any more.	1
ClaimBuster	10904	When we've worked hard to end the Northern Korean nuclear threat.	0
ClaimBuster	10905	The second point I want to make is -- is the issue of energy.	0
ClaimBuster	10906	Why do I take it now?	0
ClaimBuster	10907	The negotiations far the Panama Canal started under President Johnson and have continued up to the present time.	1
ClaimBuster	10908	Governor Romney then also wants to spend $2 trillion on additional military programs even though the military's not asking for them.	1
ClaimBuster	10909	Well, what he is saying there in effect, we're going to have inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	10910	I just happen to believe strongly that marriage is between a man and a woman.	0
ClaimBuster	10911	And that we do those things that make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, innovators, businesses to grow.	0
ClaimBuster	10912	But that's the way I, George Bush, feel about it.	0
ClaimBuster	10913	I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing.	0
ClaimBuster	10914	I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training, because this world is more complex and we're being pressed harder all the time.	0
ClaimBuster	10915	It always works that way.	0
ClaimBuster	10916	In Africa, the United States has ignored Latin uh - Africa.	0
ClaimBuster	10917	I guess it's because you will lose your right to tell them what to think.	0
ClaimBuster	10918	And for the state to interfere in that decision, under whatever guise, and with whatever rationale, for the state to try to take over in that situation, and by edict, command what the individual shall do, and substitute itself for that individual's conscience, for her right to consult her rabbi, her minister, her priest, her doctor - any other counselor of her choice - I think goes beyond what we want to ever see accomplished in this country, if we really believe in the First Amendment: if we really believe in freedom of choice and the right of the individual.	0
ClaimBuster	10919	A free Iraq will be an ally in the war on terror, and that's essential.	0
ClaimBuster	10920	But the -- but here's the thing, is that, even if Senator McCain were to say that vouchers were the way to go -- I disagree with him on this, because the data doesn't show that it actually solves the problem -- the centerpiece of Senator McCain's education policy is to increase the voucher program in D.C. by 2,000 slots.	1
ClaimBuster	10921	I'm getting rid of the carried interest provision.	0
ClaimBuster	10922	He came here for a reason, to tout our record on health in Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	10923	After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.	1
ClaimBuster	10924	Your targeted tax cut, Mr. President, never hits anybody.	0
ClaimBuster	10925	He wants to give you sort of a government tax cut, which really doesn't mean anything.	0
ClaimBuster	10926	Well, I think what the vice president is saying is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this decision.	0
ClaimBuster	10927	And so I say that the record shows that we know how to keep the peace, to keep it without surrender.	0
ClaimBuster	10928	Even though it's true that, perhaps, between now and the end of the decade, our total consumption of oil may not increase by more than, perhaps, a million or 2 million barrels of oil a day.	1
ClaimBuster	10929	I don't believe legalizing narcotics is the answer.	0
ClaimBuster	10930	We shouldn't be lending money to corrupt officials.	0
ClaimBuster	10931	One other point I would make: what could you do?	0
ClaimBuster	10932	But I can assure you that if I'm elected president, the whole spectrum of taxes will be gone through carefully.	0
ClaimBuster	10933	I was given the briefing and told that any time, night or day, I might be called upon to make the most fateful decision on Earth -- whether to fire these atomic weapons that could destroy the human species.	1
ClaimBuster	10934	I also will not add a penny to the debt.	0
ClaimBuster	10935	I believe we should increase our strength all over the world.	0
ClaimBuster	10936	Makes you feel real good to hear that, right?	0
ClaimBuster	10937	And since we did that, in the areas where we concluded, trade agreements or exports to Japan have gone up by 85 percent in the last four years and our trade deficit with Japan has gone down.	1
ClaimBuster	10938	My fellow Americans, as I've said at the very beginning of this debate, both President Bush and I love this country very much.	1
ClaimBuster	10939	These are not just women's issues.	0
ClaimBuster	10940	I was in the Lomax AME Church.	1
ClaimBuster	10941	You've said the same thing, you're going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base.	1
ClaimBuster	10942	Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.	1
ClaimBuster	10943	Also, the new energy policy has been predicated on two factors: One is conservation, which requires sacrifice, and the other one, increase in production of American energy, which is going along very well - more coal this year than ever before in American history, more oil and gas wells drilled this year than ever before in history.	1
ClaimBuster	10944	Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	10945	I - I accomplished this with s - substantial reductions in employees in some departments.	1
ClaimBuster	10946	And we are not well served when we attack each other in a kind of ad hominem way.	0
ClaimBuster	10947	We are -- right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash.	0
ClaimBuster	10948	And my plan has a better chance of standing up and fighting for those troops.	0
ClaimBuster	10949	And throughout all that time the people I have fought for have been the middle-class families, and I have been willing to stand up to powerful interests like the big insurance companies, the drug companies, the HMOs, the oil companies.	1
ClaimBuster	10950	I think that's fundamental in our country, that you know what you're getting into.	0
ClaimBuster	10951	John, I'm sorry, but that's not true.	0
ClaimBuster	10952	Anyway, he co-sponsored McCain-Feingold, and yet he didn't.	1
ClaimBuster	10953	So what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country.	1
ClaimBuster	10954	I won't hold it against him that he went to Yale.	0
ClaimBuster	10955	I thought he made the right decision to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	10956	We have nuclear power, which, I believe, with the safest.	0
ClaimBuster	10957	The other day I was honored to be flanked by Colin Powell and General Norman Schwartzkopf recently stood by me side and agreed with me.	1
ClaimBuster	10958	And I think Ross Perot has done a good job in having them.	0
ClaimBuster	10959	I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	10960	I believe, number one, it would pose a real problem for a lot of smaller states in the Congress who have enough trouble now making sure their interests are heard.	0
ClaimBuster	10961	Now what is the issue is what we're going to do in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	10962	And at the same time will destroy markets that are important to our farmers.	0
ClaimBuster	10963	But what I've also says is for above $250,000, we can go back to the tax rates we had when Bill Clinton was president.	0
ClaimBuster	10964	Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS.	1
ClaimBuster	10965	It's been projected that they could conceivably bust the budget by $900 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	10966	Spending research and development money so that we can use our technological base to figure out new uses for farm products.	0
ClaimBuster	10967	We believe that that's too much additional money to take out of the pockets of the people.	0
ClaimBuster	10968	He just liked to make it sound exager, a little better, made him feel better.	0
ClaimBuster	10969	They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.	1
ClaimBuster	10970	We're working with Canada to hopefully -- that they'll produce a -- help us realize the vaccine necessary to make sure our citizens have got flu vaccinations during this upcoming season.	1
ClaimBuster	10971	When the businesses go bankrupt, I know them.	0
ClaimBuster	10972	I have costed out what I'm going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	10973	There are 30 countries there.	1
ClaimBuster	10974	She's been doing this for 30 years.	1
ClaimBuster	10975	And that's the way Eisenhower and Reagan and Kennedy and others did it.	1
ClaimBuster	10976	Like Mr. Perot, I have held crack babies in my arms.	1
ClaimBuster	10977	And it's time we had that bresh of freth air (sic) -- breath of fresh air coming into our nation's capital and sweep out the old-boy network and the cronyism that's been so much a part of it that I've fought against for all these years.	0
ClaimBuster	10978	Help us prioritize those who need to get the flu shot, the elderly and the young.	0
ClaimBuster	10979	He has no respect for our president.	0
ClaimBuster	10980	And I'm going to keep on vetoing them, because I don't think we're taxed too little.	0
ClaimBuster	10981	That is a bad policy.	0
ClaimBuster	10982	We just have a bad system.	0
ClaimBuster	10983	But we went from 2,200 to 500.	1
ClaimBuster	10984	So -- so let's state -- one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	10985	Well, I always have difficulty recognizing my positions when they're stated by the Vice President.	0
ClaimBuster	10986	And I've got a different vision for America.	0
ClaimBuster	10987	I can't let the man continue with fuzzy math.	0
ClaimBuster	10988	I'm going to hold that summit.	0
ClaimBuster	10989	It's a horrible thing she's doing.	0
ClaimBuster	10990	One by holding down the value of their currency.	0
ClaimBuster	10991	We have the lowest per capita state and local spending in the country.	1
ClaimBuster	10992	And I don't think the record justifies the conclusion that you come to.	0
ClaimBuster	10993	We have to do this job.	0
ClaimBuster	10994	But since they're bred from childhood to fight with one another rather than get results, you know, I would be glad to drop out and spend a little time and see if we couldn't build some bridges.	0
ClaimBuster	10995	So is it President Obama's fault?	0
ClaimBuster	10996	He has about uh - four times as much chance that he'll be out of work in his life as the white baby.	1
ClaimBuster	10997	And I was probably one of the first senators, along with Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, a former senator, to go down into the KGB underneath Treblinka Square and see reams of files with names in them.	1
ClaimBuster	10998	I don't have any PAC money in my campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	10999	Because China, Germany, they're making these investments.	1
ClaimBuster	11000	I think what Mr. Novins was referring to was not one of Senator Kennedy's speeches, but the Democratic platform, which did mention cutting the national debt.	0
ClaimBuster	11001	These weren't taken from abortion or something like that.	0
ClaimBuster	11002	Susan, I don't agree that there are no women and minorities in important positions in my campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	11003	I was one of only a few Democrats in the Senate to support the Persian Gulf War.	1
ClaimBuster	11004	Our party has been focused too long.	0
ClaimBuster	11005	There have been many wars in the history of mankind.	1
ClaimBuster	11006	Secrecy ought to be stripped away from government and a maximum of personal privacy ought to be maintained.	0
ClaimBuster	11007	One is make sure Congress doesn't overspend.	0
ClaimBuster	11008	And we can't expect that if we do the same things that we've been doing over the last eight years, that somehow we are going to have a different outcome.	0
ClaimBuster	11009	I think that he just said that freedom is a gift from the Almighty.	0
ClaimBuster	11010	My mind was full of what I was going to put in that letter about the problems and the issues that confront us in our time and what we did about them.	0
ClaimBuster	11011	And I believe if we have a good balanced approach, we can get the good banks loaning money again, end the credit crunch, have proper regulation on the ones that are in trouble, and not overreact.	0
ClaimBuster	11012	We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not.	0
ClaimBuster	11013	That's precisely what Vladimir Putin understands, as well.	0
ClaimBuster	11014	This doesn't have to be.	0
ClaimBuster	11015	Sometimes people who are very idealistic and have great dreams, as young people do, are apt to stay at arm's length from the political process because they think their good hearts might be brittle, and if they invest their hopes and allow themselves to believe, then they're gonna be let down and disappointed.	0
ClaimBuster	11016	Number two, make sure that they are standing by our interests in Israel's security, because it is a true friend and our greatest ally in the region.	0
ClaimBuster	11017	Yes, we now have catastrophic health insurance, but it's going to cost, and that's going to be an additional burden on elderly citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	11018	I believe that 25 million people, the vast majority, long to have elections.	0
ClaimBuster	11019	Well obviously we wouldn't use the Russians if they didn't agree with our answer, Mr. Vice President.	0
ClaimBuster	11020	And to the governor's credit, you supported us going into Libya and the coalition that we organized.	1
ClaimBuster	11021	And if there's anything more unwise than that, I don't know what it is.	0
ClaimBuster	11022	And ended up we had more votes than he had, then they decided to pull the plug.	1
ClaimBuster	11023	Another one that's uh - that's very important is the uh - is the business deductions, uh - jet airplanes, uh - first class travel, the fifty-dollar martini lunch.	0
ClaimBuster	11024	I think it is a deterrent.	0
ClaimBuster	11025	So that's -- that's number one.	0
ClaimBuster	11026	Just look at those little children, and if anybody can even think about legalizing drugs, they've lost me.	0
ClaimBuster	11027	Why threaten our space satellites upon which we depend?	0
ClaimBuster	11028	And it would be one to take Government off the backs of the great people of this country, and turn you loose again to do those things that I know you can do so well, because you did them and made this country great.	0
ClaimBuster	11029	Do you know that it's gone completely out of control to the point where it corrupts people?	0
ClaimBuster	11030	And so, in terms of bringing down deductions, one way of doing that would be say everybody gets -- I'll pick a number -- $25,000 of deductions and credits, and you can decide which ones to use.	0
ClaimBuster	11031	The whole world has had economic problems.	1
ClaimBuster	11032	We ought to have universal pre-school and we ought to make college tuition tax deductible, up to $10,000 a year.	0
ClaimBuster	11033	I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	11034	In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city.	1
ClaimBuster	11035	But - and I, look, mental - that was a little overstated it.	0
ClaimBuster	11036	I believe it's essential that we do it because in the next ten years the balance of power is going to begin to move in the world from one direction or another - towards us or towards the Communists - and unless we begin to identify ourselves not only with the anti-Communist fight, but also with the fight against poverty and hunger, these people are going to begin to turn to the Communists as an example.	0
ClaimBuster	11037	All 50 states did it.	1
ClaimBuster	11038	And I'm standing here as someone who, a long time ago as the county attorney in Russell, Kansas, one of our jobs every month was go through all the welfare checks and sign them.	1
ClaimBuster	11039	Well, why don't -- why don't -- let's talk about this, Tom, because there was just a lot of stuff out there.	0
ClaimBuster	11040	But now we can, we ought to pass this budget now and put ten years on it right away so no one has to worry about it.	0
ClaimBuster	11041	Now I want to go further.	0
ClaimBuster	11042	But we also have to deal with drug education prevention here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	11043	And therefore, I've always believed that a mother, if medically it is determined that her life is at risk if she goes through with the pregnancy, she has a right then to take the life of even her own unborn child in defense of her own.	0
ClaimBuster	11044	I think it was one of the things that Mr. Bush said about Mr. Reagan back in 1980.	1
ClaimBuster	11045	And on the assault weapon ban, out of 17 weapons that were banned, only six banned now because eleven have been modified and are back on the street.	1
ClaimBuster	11046	I believe this economy is sound and that we're going to move up.	0
ClaimBuster	11047	An election law just in the last few days.	0
ClaimBuster	11048	But I really don't think there's anything that I could say to President Truman that's going to cause him, at the age of seventy-six, to change his particular speaking manner.	0
ClaimBuster	11049	But I believe that by the end of the first four years of uh - of the next term we could have the unemployment down to 3 percent adult unemployment, which is about uh - 4 to 4 and a half percent overall uh controlled inflation rate and have a uh balance of growth of about - uh 4 to 6 percent, around 5 percent which would give us a balanced budget.	1
ClaimBuster	11050	We have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off.	0
ClaimBuster	11051	I mean, we've cut defense spending too much in the first place.	1
ClaimBuster	11052	But let me respond to what you said.	0
ClaimBuster	11053	The President has not called for an unconditional end to the violence.	1
ClaimBuster	11054	And the flow of imports into this country is swamping the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	11055	We need to put health care records online.	0
ClaimBuster	11056	The other thing that we have to focus on, though, is Al Qaida.	0
ClaimBuster	11057	I think the American people have a right to judge us on this question, on how we picked a running mate, a person who is a heartbeat away from the presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	11058	And, 5, I would have an aggressive program of school reform, more choices -- I favor public schools or these new charter schools -- we can talk about that if you want.	0
ClaimBuster	11059	We didn't need that tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	11060	But maybe I misunderstand where you're coming from, Mr. Vice President, but I think the United States must be humble and must be proud and confident of our values, but humble in how we treat nations that are figuring out how to chart their own course.	0
ClaimBuster	11061	But they weren't taken care of.	0
ClaimBuster	11062	Okay, I thought I answered it by saying that it would be on the basis of merit.	0
ClaimBuster	11063	I promise you the economy is going to get better.	0
ClaimBuster	11064	Let me say there is only one uh - point I would add.	0
ClaimBuster	11065	America has never gotten in a war because we were too strong.	0
ClaimBuster	11066	And I don't want to do that, and I won't do that.	0
ClaimBuster	11067	And our enemies are strengthened from all of this.	0
ClaimBuster	11068	I'm going to work with Democrats and Republicans to reform the system.	0
ClaimBuster	11069	I guess the question I would ask of Mr. Bush is how we instill those values, how we create this environment for the drug free schools that we want in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	11070	He got a deferment or he didn't.	0
ClaimBuster	11071	They've always had stakes in it.	0
ClaimBuster	11072	So we have to have, in my judgment, a drastic simplification of the basic health insurance policies of this country, be very comprehensive for everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	11073	If I'm elected we won't have Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	11074	Well, his rhetoric doesn't match his record.	1
ClaimBuster	11075	Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is.	0
ClaimBuster	11076	If I may just briefly, Jim, note.	0
ClaimBuster	11077	I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress.	0
ClaimBuster	11078	Now, both of us are kind of, I guess, stating the other's position in a maximalist extreme way, but I think there is a difference here.	0
ClaimBuster	11079	We can't do that to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	11080	So, we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending -- the increase, rate of increase in government spending, which has come down from 17 to 6 percent, and, at the same time, as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the Government gets, without raising taxes, those two lines will meet.	1
ClaimBuster	11081	So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share.	0
ClaimBuster	11082	Look, it's just not true.	0
ClaimBuster	11083	It not only happened in California.	1
ClaimBuster	11084	But let me take the other side of the coin, if I might.	0
ClaimBuster	11085	The interests of the American people must be at stake.	0
ClaimBuster	11086	You see, he's proposed $2.2 trillion of new spending.	1
ClaimBuster	11087	And we could be moving out to the human population a whole lot faster than we are on some of these new drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	11088	World peace is important, and we have enhanced the peace.	1
ClaimBuster	11089	We met the goals this year, but in the previous years we have not met recruiting goals.	1
ClaimBuster	11090	She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada.	1
ClaimBuster	11091	And I have to make that judgment.	1
ClaimBuster	11092	All of the things that she's talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let's say, while she had great power.	0
ClaimBuster	11093	So I made a mistake, and I -- you know, the difference, I think, is that I knew at the time I was going to take a lot of political flak.	0
ClaimBuster	11094	But, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing?	0
ClaimBuster	11095	This is the first administration since the bomb went off that made no progress.	1
ClaimBuster	11096	It had nothing to do with the transfer of payments from government by way of many programs.	0
ClaimBuster	11097	I do want to make sure that...	0
ClaimBuster	11098	I think it take fresh leadership now, and an understanding of those forces of change to provide the kind of strength that we need, and perhaps the vice president can explain what he was doing when he supported the trading of arms to terrorist nation, and his involvement in Panama and that endorsement of Mr. Macros.	1
ClaimBuster	11099	I am in favor, as the president has said, and I agree with him, which is that if people have committed crimes we got to get them out of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	11100	I didn't know any of these -- I didn't see these women.	1
ClaimBuster	11101	And I also think it's very important to go to the next stage of welfare reform.	0
ClaimBuster	11102	the most stringent of safety requirements, could meet our energy needs for the next couple of decades while we go forward exploring the areas of solar power and other forms of energy that might be renewable and that would not be exhaustible.	0
ClaimBuster	11103	"They're trying to say, ""Did you make a mistake going into Iraq?"""	0
ClaimBuster	11104	He didn't take that position on Tibet.	1
ClaimBuster	11105	Because they have to balance their budgets.	0
ClaimBuster	11106	And have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	11107	I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just -- just came in.	1
ClaimBuster	11108	There's another, a similar issue out there that relates to your -- it is said, at least, that you were unaware that the Soviet retaliatory power was based on land-based missiles.	1
ClaimBuster	11109	We should key our foreign aid, our direct foreign investment, and that of our friends, we should coordinate it to make sure that we -- we push back and give them more economic development.	0
ClaimBuster	11110	Because if it is, I should win easily, it was so bad.	0
ClaimBuster	11111	Every 4 years, they send you all kinds of messages to tell you how to vote and then go back to business as usual.	0
ClaimBuster	11112	We announce we're going after Mosul.	1
ClaimBuster	11113	I'm not even certain you were too excited about that.	0
ClaimBuster	11114	I've gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I've been doing this as a politician.	1
ClaimBuster	11115	It's a fairly rural state.	1
ClaimBuster	11116	The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents.	0
ClaimBuster	11117	But it's in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it's not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody.	1
ClaimBuster	11118	The s- I believe the Soviet Union is first in outer space.	0
ClaimBuster	11119	Secondly, Senator Dole had some pretty harsh comments about special interest money, but it wasn't me who opposed what we tried to do to save the lives of children who were subject to tobacco and then went to the tobacco growers and bragged about standing up for the Federal government when we tried to stop the advertising, marketing, and sales of tobacco to children.	1
ClaimBuster	11120	Because, when we sell these new products here, we'll then be able to sell them overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	11121	And we need to do something about that.	0
ClaimBuster	11122	Well, you don't realize we have a hate crimes statute?	0
ClaimBuster	11123	This is a great land.	0
ClaimBuster	11124	And I believe that the right of choice is a constitutional right.	0
ClaimBuster	11125	But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person.	0
ClaimBuster	11126	Now, I think that's the right strategy; I think that's the right policy.	0
ClaimBuster	11127	Let me give you another example.	0
ClaimBuster	11128	There is a tax gap.	1
ClaimBuster	11129	It is 1.3 trillion Mr. Vice President.	1
ClaimBuster	11130	But having said that, America -- and we'll hear a lot of criticism.	0
ClaimBuster	11131	That's one of my promises.	0
ClaimBuster	11132	We've had an opportunity to campaign all over this country and to meet with so many of you in communities and states and regions to get to know you.	1
ClaimBuster	11133	"You know, they even had the Defense Department issue a memorandum saying, ""Don't bother applying for assistance or for being part of the reconstruction if you weren't part of our original coalition."""	1
ClaimBuster	11134	And we can enforce law.	0
ClaimBuster	11135	What I care about is children.	0
ClaimBuster	11136	So I changed the Justice Department's effort to get a church to pay back a man tithe, because he was bankrupt when he gave it.	1
ClaimBuster	11137	"I've got post-traumatic stress disorder, and yet I can't get treatment."""	1
ClaimBuster	11138	"And that institution, the House of Representatives -- everyone is yelling ""Clean House!"""	1
ClaimBuster	11139	That is my solemn obligation.	0
ClaimBuster	11140	In Lebanon, this President exercised American power, all right, but the management of it was such that our marines were killed, we had to leave in humiliation, the Soviet Union became stronger, terrorists became emboldened.	1
ClaimBuster	11141	There's been a consistent policy on the part of this administration to lower or delay enforcement of air pollution standards and water pollution standards.	1
ClaimBuster	11142	I'm talking about giving him four or five tools - not only the fact-finding committee that he now has under the injunction provision, not only the injunction, but also the power of the fact-finding commission to make recommendations - recommendations which would not be binding, but nevertheless would have great force of public opinion behind them.	0
ClaimBuster	11143	In Houston there's been a 15- percent drop in the crime rate in the last year because of the work the mayor did there in increasing the police force.	1
ClaimBuster	11144	That's why exports have significantly increased under my presidency.	1
ClaimBuster	11145	People will tell you who served with Bob Dole, agree or disagree, he kept his word.	0
ClaimBuster	11146	We have a Democratic Congress today, and fortunately we've had a Republican president to check their excesses with my vetoes.	1
ClaimBuster	11147	When I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over.	1
ClaimBuster	11148	We have strengthened enforcement, and everybody in San Diego knows we strengthened control of the border.	1
ClaimBuster	11149	I'd never ask you to do anything for me, but I owe you this, and I'm doing it for you.	0
ClaimBuster	11150	You attended a private school for some time in your life.	1
ClaimBuster	11151	We've got to do something about this.	0
ClaimBuster	11152	I know those things can grow out of despair in an inner city, when there's hopelessness at home, lack of work, and so forth.	0
ClaimBuster	11153	We don't have to settle for 47 million people on food stamps.	0
ClaimBuster	11154	And we are going to make sure that we manage chronic illnesses, like diabetes and heart disease, that cost a huge amount, but could be prevented.	0
ClaimBuster	11155	A Gallup Poll taken in February of this year asking the - in eight out of nine countries - they asked the people, who do they think would be ahead by 1970 militarily and scientifically, and a majority in eight of the nine countries said the Soviet Union would be by 1970.	1
ClaimBuster	11156	We've never had any difficulty finding time to pray.	0
ClaimBuster	11157	But taking that one no from the Soviet Union, we then went back into negotiations on their terms, because Mr. Carter had canceled the B-I bomber, delayed the MX, delayed the Trident submarine, delayed the cruise missile, shut down the Missile Man - the three - the Minuteman missile production line, and whatever other things that might have been done.	1
ClaimBuster	11158	And we saw the Governor and his son on television the night before and his family, and his mother who was there.	1
ClaimBuster	11159	But it is true our borders are out of control.	0
ClaimBuster	11160	And all of her donors -- just about all of them -- I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars...	1
ClaimBuster	11161	I'm not going to set the White House visitors schedule before I'm president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	11162	Surely we can afford 5% of the $25 trillion that are coming into the treasury to the hard working people that pay the bills.	1
ClaimBuster	11163	These commitments that the Democratic Party has historically made to the working families of this nation have been extremely important to the growth in their stature and in a better quality of life for them.	0
ClaimBuster	11164	You take these big companies, these trade deals are far bigger than these companies, and yet we don't use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary, I must say.	0
ClaimBuster	11165	The American people are pretty smart: they know who writes out the checks.	0
ClaimBuster	11166	Senator Kennedy has expressed some hopes in this field, hopes which I think all Americans would share who want some problem - some progress in this area.	0
ClaimBuster	11167	She asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what I'm going through.	1
ClaimBuster	11168	Why the hell didn't you do it over the last 15, 20 years?	0
ClaimBuster	11169	Less than two hundred for all the countries of Africa and they need trained leadership more than anything.	1
ClaimBuster	11170	Well first of all, I don't agree with Senator Kennedy that Cuba is lost and certainly China was lost when this Administration came into power in 1953.	1
ClaimBuster	11171	When I talked about the automakers, they are obviously getting hammered right now.	0
ClaimBuster	11172	We need to make it clear we're for human liberty.	0
ClaimBuster	11173	I want to thank Washington University for hosting us here this evening.	0
ClaimBuster	11174	That's the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower.	1
ClaimBuster	11175	And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	11176	I believe we should be stronger than we now are.	0
ClaimBuster	11177	You can't ship them overseas anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	11178	I know what it's like to go out on one of those missions when you don't know what's around the corner.	0
ClaimBuster	11179	Uh - this would - would help a great deal.	0
ClaimBuster	11180	The top 5 percent will continue to pay 60 percent, as they do today.	1
ClaimBuster	11181	Plus, he says the cornerstone of his plan to succeed in Iraq is to call upon nations to serve.	1
ClaimBuster	11182	Now, I believe, also, that this meeting this mission, this responsibility for preserving the peace, which I believe is a responsibility peculiar to our country, and that we cannot shirk our responsibility as a leader of the free world because we're the only ones that can do it.	0
ClaimBuster	11183	It's a culture that somewhere along the line we've begun to disrespect life.	0
ClaimBuster	11184	I think once it gets into productive stages, that we ought to, obviously, turn it over to the private sector.	0
ClaimBuster	11185	It only whets their appetite; and then the question comes, when do you stop them?	0
ClaimBuster	11186	We now import about 44 percent of our oil.	1
ClaimBuster	11187	Well, it can only have the effect certainly of reducing it.	0
ClaimBuster	11188	I believe we need incentive for the individual, and for business and industry, and I believe the plan that I have submitted, with detailed backing, and which has been approved by a number of our leading economists in the country, is based on projections.	1
ClaimBuster	11189	You cannot lead if you send mixed messages.	0
ClaimBuster	11190	"And she looked at me from her hospital bed and she just looked at me and she said, ""Remember: integrity, integrity, integrity."	1
ClaimBuster	11191	You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible -- you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land -- we've become a third world country.	1
ClaimBuster	11192	I was talking about early childhood education for disadvantaged little children.	1
ClaimBuster	11193	I take my job seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	11194	And I know there are some in our party that disagree with that sentiment.	0
ClaimBuster	11195	And among those vetoes, I stopped $16 billion in additional spending.	1
ClaimBuster	11196	Now you say maybe or it depends, which means not only were you wrong, but you were also confusing in sending mixed messages both to our troops and our allies.	0
ClaimBuster	11197	And the last statement, just a few days ago, was a speech to the effect that we have inflation because Government revenues have not kept pace with Government spending.	1
ClaimBuster	11198	He said that no man with that size misery index has a right to seek reelection to the Presidency.	1
ClaimBuster	11199	In the past, the relationship between Social Security and Medicare has been very important to providing some modicum of aid for senior citizens in the retention of health benefits.	0
ClaimBuster	11200	Again we turn to the past.	0
ClaimBuster	11201	Are we better of with this arms race?	0
ClaimBuster	11202	I've always been against them.	1
ClaimBuster	11203	Nothing's going to ever happen.	0
ClaimBuster	11204	There's a lot of shut-in gas that we need to be moving out of Alaska by pipeline.	1
ClaimBuster	11205	It's an issue throughout our society.	0
ClaimBuster	11206	I think any time we end with one of these attacks, it's appropriate to respond.	0
ClaimBuster	11207	It used to be that the average - uh family could own a house.	1
ClaimBuster	11208	A record is never something to stand on.	0
ClaimBuster	11209	We're bringing our jobs back.	0
ClaimBuster	11210	Hey, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, because what Joe wanted to do was buy the business that he's been working for 10-12 hours a day, seven days a week, and you said that you wanted to spread the wealth, but -- in other words, take Joe's money and then you decide what to do with it.	0
ClaimBuster	11211	So what do we do?	0
ClaimBuster	11212	We need to strengthen that in order to assure our Western allies of our presence there, a strong defense, but also to diminish and reduce the likelihood of a commencement of a war and the use of nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	11213	Now, it's $4.00 a gallon.	1
ClaimBuster	11214	My opponent, in that he's out of the mainstream, voted against that law.	1
ClaimBuster	11215	It's called Immediate Helping Hand.	1
ClaimBuster	11216	But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is -- there's been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government.	0
ClaimBuster	11217	Thanks a lot for doing a great job.	0
ClaimBuster	11218	Well, I did with my first statement.	1
ClaimBuster	11219	"I've had shop stewards stand up and say, ""Will you promise me you're going to stop all this outsourcing?"	1
ClaimBuster	11220	We're proud to be here.	0
ClaimBuster	11221	Apparently what they've done is they were paying people to go out and register folks, and apparently some of the people who were out there didn't really register people, they just filled out a bunch of names.	1
ClaimBuster	11222	See, what you see is what you get and if you don't like it, you got two other choices, right?	0
ClaimBuster	11223	And the exit strategy needs to be well-defined.	0
ClaimBuster	11224	... as I said, trumped-up trickle-down.	0
ClaimBuster	11225	When the -- when the president of Iraq -- excuse me, of Iran, Ahmadinejad, says that our debt makes us not a great country, that's a frightening thing.	1
ClaimBuster	11226	No, I don't think that's the right answer.	0
ClaimBuster	11227	I want to first, obviously, thank Belmont University, Tom, thank you, and to all of you who are participating tonight and those of you who sent e-mail questions in.	0
ClaimBuster	11228	And so the question here tonight is not where we've been, but where we're going.	0
ClaimBuster	11229	If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.	1
ClaimBuster	11230	We can't sanction them any more.	0
ClaimBuster	11231	Came out and told the truth in this brilliant book, Against All Hope, about what is actually happening in Cuba.	1
ClaimBuster	11232	What we're going to give you is a 50 percent tax credit to help provide health care for those that you need.	0
ClaimBuster	11233	She had a chance to do something with Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	11234	Are you suggesting that if somebody has means that the national debt doesn't affect them?	0
ClaimBuster	11235	We need more resources there.	0
ClaimBuster	11236	And I have great respect and admiration for his wife.	0
ClaimBuster	11237	Sometimes it does seem that a campaign generates more heat than light.	0
ClaimBuster	11238	Uh - what we're doing is saying that there are opportunities, business opportunities, educational opportunities, responsibilities uh - where people with talent, black or any other minority, can fully qualify.	1
ClaimBuster	11239	And I thank you, and I thank you, my friend.	0
ClaimBuster	11240	I also presented to the Congress and they adopted a large package of quality-of-life improvements, which are very important.	1
ClaimBuster	11241	Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you.	0
ClaimBuster	11242	We have to have nuclear power.	0
ClaimBuster	11243	But it won't be on my timetable, it will be on the timetable that people are comfortable with in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	11244	I disagree that we need 150,000 troops to fulfill our role in Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	11245	The President wants to increase spending 20 percent over the next six years.	1
ClaimBuster	11246	And so, this is a reasonable policy to protect old stands of trees and at the same time make sure our forests aren't vulnerable to the forest fires that have destroyed acres after acres in the West.	1
ClaimBuster	11247	See, I think the mission has somewhat become fuzzy.	0
ClaimBuster	11248	Not one of them are paid for.	1
ClaimBuster	11249	So let's go through them one by one.	0
ClaimBuster	11250	Now Senator Obama talks about the very, very rich.	0
ClaimBuster	11251	Well, let me just said that that this is -- he -- Senator Obama doesn't want a free trade agreement with our best ally in the region but wants to sit down across the table without precondition to -- with Hugo Chavez, the guy who has been helping FARC, the terrorist organization.	1
ClaimBuster	11252	It can be an engine that drives us into the future the same way the computer was the engine for economic growth over the last couple of decades.	0
ClaimBuster	11253	I think it's going to require good, solid credit policies.	0
ClaimBuster	11254	I'm here with a group of 13 people from around the country who helped me prepare.	1
ClaimBuster	11255	And this is what the Republicans have done to us.	0
ClaimBuster	11256	"This is different from saying, ""OK, let me incent you to go on the government."""	0
ClaimBuster	11257	Five million homes were lost.	1
ClaimBuster	11258	It is the same overall strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	11259	I know who I am, and I know where I'm from, and I know where I want to take America.	0
ClaimBuster	11260	We can't continue to shuffle children through school.	0
ClaimBuster	11261	You see, last year in the primary, he expressed his passion.	1
ClaimBuster	11262	And I want to continue those tax cuts for middle-class families, and for small business.	0
ClaimBuster	11263	And I'm glad we're going in the right direction.	0
ClaimBuster	11264	This country uh - changed drastically in 1969 when the uh - terms of John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were over and Richard Nixon and - and Gerald Ford became the presidents.	1
ClaimBuster	11265	There is a partnership involved in our nation.	0
ClaimBuster	11266	But Social Security is a tax.	0
ClaimBuster	11267	There's a lot of good people working hard.	0
ClaimBuster	11268	But in order to stop this arms madness, we've got to push ahead with tough negotiations that are verifiable so that we know the Soviets are agreeing and living up to their agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	11269	And they really matter when you are president.	0
ClaimBuster	11270	Now, you got to stop letting these people tell you who to vote for, you got to stop letting these folks in the press tell you you're throwing your vote away -- you got to start using your own head.	0
ClaimBuster	11271	Now, because the governor has all this money for a tax cut mostly to the wealthy, there is no money left over, so schools get testing and lawsuit reform and not much else.	1
ClaimBuster	11272	I subscribe to the Justice Potter Stewart standard.	1
ClaimBuster	11273	As a matter of fact, one of the secretaries of HEW under Mr. Carter testified that he thought there was $7 billion worth of fraud and waste in welfare and in the medical programs associated with it.	1
ClaimBuster	11274	Whose taxes will you raise?	0
ClaimBuster	11275	And the thing I find the most troubling about Obama Care, well it's a long list, but one of the things I find most troubling is that when you go out and talk to small businesses and ask them what they think about it, they tell you it keeps them from hiring more people.	0
ClaimBuster	11276	And we're going to do it by investing in prevention.	0
ClaimBuster	11277	Well, I would say first of all, I think, it's a very good question.	0
ClaimBuster	11278	One of the reasons that I ran for president, Sandy, is because not just children, a lot of grownups felt that way.	0
ClaimBuster	11279	And, incidentally, may I say that that's the decision of the Congress, and the president has concurred.	0
ClaimBuster	11280	They will live the American dream.	0
ClaimBuster	11281	I believe in this goal and effort with all my heart.	0
ClaimBuster	11282	Now we have this incredible mess in Iraq -- $200 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	11283	Senator Dole said 30 years ago he was one of 12 people who voted against Medicare and he was proud of it.	1
ClaimBuster	11284	And to spend billions and billions of dollars as Mr. Bush apparently wants to, although, he, himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately-on Star Wars-in my judgment makes no sense at all.	0
ClaimBuster	11285	We've had record numbers of new small businesses and 10 and a half million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	11286	I look at the trial lawyers, and when you're a few million short, you run out to Hollywood and pick up two to four million and organized labor comes to Washington, D.C. and puts 35 million into the pot.	0
ClaimBuster	11287	I made a decision not to join the International Criminal Court in The Hague, which is where our troops could be brought to -- brought in front of a judge, an unaccounted judge.	1
ClaimBuster	11288	That was locker room talk.	1
ClaimBuster	11289	Their budget cut $270 billion in Medicare and, finally, their budget withdrew the national guarantee of healthcare to poor children, families with children with handicaps, the elderly in nursing homes, poor pregnant women.	1
ClaimBuster	11290	What he said was a precipitous...	0
ClaimBuster	11291	...because the private sector's not going to invest in a...	0
ClaimBuster	11292	If I become president, I'll get America working again.	0
ClaimBuster	11293	We need to explore our resources and we need to develop our reservoirs of domestic production.	0
ClaimBuster	11294	Not with the measure that leaves the majority of them without any real basic help until the next president's term of four years is over.	1
ClaimBuster	11295	And so I just have to say, it's fine.	0
ClaimBuster	11296	... is if your -- if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that.	0
ClaimBuster	11297	I want the federal government, consistent with local control and new accountability, to make improvement of our schools the number one priority so Caley will have a desk and can sit down in a classroom where she can learn.	0
ClaimBuster	11298	We could have an urban homestead act.	0
ClaimBuster	11299	It wouldn't be fair for me to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	11300	But take Russia, for example.	0
ClaimBuster	11301	I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, we're thinking of dropping our insurance, we can't afford it.	1
ClaimBuster	11302	And I'd like to know where have we been defeated and where have we retreated?	0
ClaimBuster	11303	We need to say we each need to be responsible for what we do.	0
ClaimBuster	11304	I think a lot of times we just spend aid and say we feel better about it and it ends up being spent the wrong way, and there's some pretty egregious examples recently.	0
ClaimBuster	11305	And now our kids are being killed with ammos right out of that dump.	0
ClaimBuster	11306	When we talk about cutting health care costs, let's start with the insurance companies and the people that are making a killing instead of making our people healthy.	0
ClaimBuster	11307	And once you're out on your own with this $5,000 credit, Senator McCain, for the first time, is going to be taxing the health care benefits that you have from your employer.	1
ClaimBuster	11308	Curriculum that works and phonics needs to be an integral part of our reading curriculum.	0
ClaimBuster	11309	I believe that we have to win this.	0
ClaimBuster	11310	Now, and -- and I've talked to a guy who has a very small business.	1
ClaimBuster	11311	I, too, thank the University of Miami, and say our prayers are with the good people of this state, who've suffered a lot.	0
ClaimBuster	11312	Because more people qualify for them because they don't have money.	1
ClaimBuster	11313	And we've been guilty of that.	0
ClaimBuster	11314	"Frankly, I'm not going to tell that person without health insurance that, ""I'm sorry, you'll have to wait."""	0
ClaimBuster	11315	I think that homeowners have to be respected and their right to have a gun if they wish to.	0
ClaimBuster	11316	And I would institute the same kind of procedure as president, not only in judicial appointments, but also in diplomatic appointments.	0
ClaimBuster	11317	They're supposed to be our first line of defense against drugs and the war against drugs, because they don't have enough fuel.	0
ClaimBuster	11318	I will never let those troops down, and will hunt and kill the terrorists wherever they are.	0
ClaimBuster	11319	Now when the president ran for office, he said that he'd put in place, in his first year, a piece of legislation -- he'd file a bill in his first year that would reform our -- our immigration system, protect legal immigration, stop illegal immigration.	1
ClaimBuster	11320	You know what he said?	0
ClaimBuster	11321	You take a look at what's happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies.	1
ClaimBuster	11322	Now 60 percent go to the Arab countries, and this does not include Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	11323	I think that our goal ought to be first of all not to politicize it, not to frighten people; secondly to say that we have to enforce the law in 2 ways.	0
ClaimBuster	11324	As Commander in Chief, I will maintain the strongest military in the world, keep faith with our troops and go after those who would do us harm.	0
ClaimBuster	11325	Now, whether preemption is ultimately what has to happen, I don't know yet.	0
ClaimBuster	11326	What about the honor of my state?	0
ClaimBuster	11327	I've made no judgment about who should be secretary of state.	0
ClaimBuster	11328	Mine is rooted in the real lives of real people, and it will bring real results if we have the courage to change.	0
ClaimBuster	11329	And so people are going to have to look at the record.	0
ClaimBuster	11330	People who got all the jobs were benefiting.	0
ClaimBuster	11331	Look, we are in tough economic times; we all know that.	0
ClaimBuster	11332	One is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and they're effectively guaranteed by the federal government.	1
ClaimBuster	11333	and kind of humiliating them is not the way you make the kind of progress we are getting.	0
ClaimBuster	11334	Now, looking to the U-2 flights, I would like to point out that I have been supporting the President's position throughout.	1
ClaimBuster	11335	I'm glad you clarified it.	0
ClaimBuster	11336	Are we going to step up to the plate as a nation the way we did after World War II, the way that generation of heroes said okay, the United States is going to be the leader.	0
ClaimBuster	11337	But look, what's really important, Charlie, is the president is just trying to scare everybody here with throwing labels around.	1
ClaimBuster	11338	So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system.	1
ClaimBuster	11339	These folks have had eight years to get something done in Washington, D.C. on the uninsured.	1
ClaimBuster	11340	It's a scaring -- he's trying to scare people in the voting booth.	0
ClaimBuster	11341	I've reached out to people all my life.	1
ClaimBuster	11342	There is a thing called clean coal.	1
ClaimBuster	11343	Well, let me just make a closing point.	0
ClaimBuster	11344	Number one, make sure that other countries are as open to our markets as our markets are to them, and, if they're not, have measures on the books that don't take forever and a day to implement.	0
ClaimBuster	11345	Ninety percent of the costs are coming out of your pockets.	1
ClaimBuster	11346	The vice president and I have a disagreement about the use of troops.	1
ClaimBuster	11347	Joe Lieberman and I gave them six months to clean up their act.	1
ClaimBuster	11348	In 1979 he made similar statements, the same effect, that the deficits -- there was nothing wrong with having deficits.	1
ClaimBuster	11349	That's how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and that's how we're going to wind down the war in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	11350	America is not standing still.	0
ClaimBuster	11351	I'm worried about our country.	0
ClaimBuster	11352	Now we have uh such a grossly unbalanced tax system - as I said earlier, that it is a disgrace - ah of all the tax - benefits now, 25 percent of 'em go to the 1 percent of the richest people in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	11353	It's small business that creates the jobs in America, and over the last four years, small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30-year low.	1
ClaimBuster	11354	I think the foremost responsibility of a president really gets down to the national security of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	11355	I ask for your vote.	0
ClaimBuster	11356	We are now spending $10 billion or more every month.	1
ClaimBuster	11357	My path is designed in getting small businesses to grow and hire people.	1
ClaimBuster	11358	So the point is -- the point is that I have repudiated every time someone's been out of line, whether they've been part of my campaign or not, and I will continue to do that.	1
ClaimBuster	11359	They're fighting us because they're fighting freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	11360	This is a perfect example of the kind of leadership that the United States, under this administration, has taken.	0
ClaimBuster	11361	Mr. George Allen, head of your Information Service, has said that that made the people of the world begin to wonder whether we were first in science.	1
ClaimBuster	11362	We passed a bill again this year in the cong- in the Senate and it died in the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives.	1
ClaimBuster	11363	Well, first of all, it's not government that makes business successful.	0
ClaimBuster	11364	We need to reform Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	11365	You have to learn from experience that making unilateral cuts in defense system is not the way that you enhance peace.	0
ClaimBuster	11366	A number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns.	1
ClaimBuster	11367	So I think it is a case of pay scale, of recognizing that if we're going to have young men and women responsible for our security, dealing with this sophisticated equipment, then for heaven's sakes, let's go out and have a pay scale that is commensurate with the sacrifice that we're asking of them.	0
ClaimBuster	11368	"As a matter of fact, I read in the ""New York Times"" where he said he co-sponsored the McCain-Feingold Campaign Fundraising Bill."	1
ClaimBuster	11369	If you think that I am a spoiler, consider these facts: Do you really think that our economy is healthy?	0
ClaimBuster	11370	I've been AWOL for 44 months, so let's take on smoking, see they haven't even done it.	1
ClaimBuster	11371	And the president supports taking $716 billion out of that program.	1
ClaimBuster	11372	If I'm president I will create -- help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes.	0
ClaimBuster	11373	And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg.	1
ClaimBuster	11374	We had someone who I'm sure regrets said it in the president's staff said he didn't care whether we made potato chips or computer chips.	1
ClaimBuster	11375	And we'll continue to protect our borders.	0
ClaimBuster	11376	That's a tribute to their interest in this election.	0
ClaimBuster	11377	They create government-sponsored health care.	1
ClaimBuster	11378	You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it.	1
ClaimBuster	11379	President Bush and I are -- are different people and these are different times and that's why my five point plan is so different than what he would have done.	0
ClaimBuster	11380	I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don't always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise.	1
ClaimBuster	11381	Well, again, the president didn't answer the question.	1
ClaimBuster	11382	"We said, ""Peace through strength,"" and it worked and the cold war is over."	1
ClaimBuster	11383	90 percent of our kids are out there in those public schools and we need to lift their standards and move them forward with the programs like those I've outlined in this campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	11384	He's troubled, as I am, by some of the things that go on today.	0
ClaimBuster	11385	Because if you want to cut the cost of campaigns, you have to open the airways, because what drives the cost of campaigns are the cost of advertising on television, radio, newspaper, mass mailing.	1
ClaimBuster	11386	And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.	0
ClaimBuster	11387	And then, with the economy that would be generated from a restraint on spending, and a tax uh reduction primarily for the middle-income people, then I think the American people would be willing to make those sacrifices for peace and prosperity in the next uh - four years.	0
ClaimBuster	11388	The federal government didn't hire our teachers.	1
ClaimBuster	11389	We've got to help the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	11390	But they weren't running for president, and in retrospect, from hindsight, I would not have given that uh - interview had I do it - had it - I to do it over again.	0
ClaimBuster	11391	When Mr. Carter became President, inflation was 4.8%, as you said.	1
ClaimBuster	11392	There must be an absolute guarantee.	0
ClaimBuster	11393	And then what you've got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care.	0
ClaimBuster	11394	You know, just a couple of weeks ago, actually, probably about a month, I saw a mother, who I had met at the bedside of her son, who had been shot in that theater.	1
ClaimBuster	11395	The governor wants to divert 1 out of every $6 off into the stock market, which means that he would drain a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund in this generation over the next ten years, and Social Security under that approach would go bankrupt within this generation.	1
ClaimBuster	11396	They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance -- your insurance plan until you're 26 years old.	1
ClaimBuster	11397	But I have a fundamental belief in the goodness and strength of the American worker.	0
ClaimBuster	11398	Some of them got it for a birthday present.	1
ClaimBuster	11399	Well, I thought the question was about defense.	0
ClaimBuster	11400	That was vouchers, Senator Obama.	1
ClaimBuster	11401	There's no way of glossing around that.	0
ClaimBuster	11402	... unfit, and he proves it every time he talks.	0
ClaimBuster	11403	I never could have dreamed anything like this would come my way in life, and I've done my best to be faithful to the charge you've given me.	0
ClaimBuster	11404	I believe that uh - our foreign policy must express the highest standards of morality.	0
ClaimBuster	11405	To me, Affirmative Action is making that extra effort.	0
ClaimBuster	11406	When George Bush came into office, our debt -- national debt was around $5 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	11407	I think that we ought to have an expanded conservation reserve program.	0
ClaimBuster	11408	That's the enemy that is now in 60 countries, with stronger recruits.	1
ClaimBuster	11409	And maybe it's just our difference in government, the way we view government.	0
ClaimBuster	11410	I just couldn't let it stand.	0
ClaimBuster	11411	Imagine what it -- what it is like for someone to be singled out unfairly, unjustly, and feel the unfair force of law simply because of race or ethnicity.	0
ClaimBuster	11412	First, the National Journal named Senator Kennedy the most liberal senator of all.	1
ClaimBuster	11413	I wasn't misleading when I said he was a threat.	0
ClaimBuster	11414	That's quite different than taking a position where you know it's best for you.	0
ClaimBuster	11415	With regard to assailing Mr. Bush about his tax problems and the difference from the tax he once paid and then the later tax he paid, I think if you looked at the deductions, there were great legal expenses in there -- had to do, possibly, with the sale of his home, and they had to do with his setting up of a blind trust.	0
ClaimBuster	11416	Or world where people have enough to eat and a world where we care about those who don't?	0
ClaimBuster	11417	As a matter of fact your question brings out a point that I am very glad to make.	0
ClaimBuster	11418	The last budget he led cut Pell Grants, cut student loans.	1
ClaimBuster	11419	There are some programs that are underfunded.	0
ClaimBuster	11420	A lot of them lost their lives.	1
ClaimBuster	11421	But let's turn for a minute to the uhh - southern African operations that are now going on.	0
ClaimBuster	11422	I can tell you at the same time, that we will make sure that we look at what's happening in Pakistan, and recognize that what's happening in Pakistan is going to have a major impact on the success in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	11423	Instead of answering people's questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that's his choice.	0
ClaimBuster	11424	I've worked on the food stamp program, proudly.	1
ClaimBuster	11425	We have to go to the root cause, and that is in Afghanistan and Pakistan.	0
ClaimBuster	11426	I think we need to have an attorney general that says if a law is broken, we'll enforce it.	0
ClaimBuster	11427	Now, to me that's not the strategy that I think people expect from America.	0
ClaimBuster	11428	We're using unmanned vehicles to spot people coming across.	1
ClaimBuster	11429	We had a BTU tax we turned into a $35 million gas tax, a $265 billion tax increase.	1
ClaimBuster	11430	It's also important to keep strong ties in the Middle East, credible ties, because of the energy crisis we're now in.	0
ClaimBuster	11431	And it is particularly terrible to take poor tiny little children and wait until the first grade and bus them across town to Mars, where the children know their numbers, know their letters, have had every advantage.	0
ClaimBuster	11432	So I would simply say, as these dates get close, you're going to have to reorganize and refix as we did with the Social Security Fund.	0
ClaimBuster	11433	No one is suggesting that.	0
ClaimBuster	11434	But I don't think it's just experience that makes the difference.	0
ClaimBuster	11435	It's one of my top priorities, Jim, to give every single child in the United States affordable health care within the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	11436	For -- so if you're -- if you're 54 or 55, you might want to listen 'cause this -- this will affect you.	1
ClaimBuster	11437	She's been trying to take them out for a long time.	1
ClaimBuster	11438	In a > Transfer interrupted!	0
ClaimBuster	11439	I believe in the greatness of our country, and I believe the American people are ready for a change in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	11440	I was in coal country in West Virginia yesterday.	1
ClaimBuster	11441	And Iraq is not even the center of the focus of the war on terror.	0
ClaimBuster	11442	And that is something that I'm going to be committed to as president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	11443	And, by the way, I want to go back a second.	0
ClaimBuster	11444	And I will not, under any circumstances increase taxes on the middle-class.	0
ClaimBuster	11445	She has no idea whether it's Russia, China, or anybody else.	0
ClaimBuster	11446	And we created an OSHA - an Occupational Safety and Health Agency - for the protection of employees before the Federal Government had one in place.	1
ClaimBuster	11447	I was just recently endorsed -- 16,500 Border Patrol agents.	1
ClaimBuster	11448	We have very fundamental differences about human rights, democracy and our basic system, our basic view of human beings and of what life is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	11449	There is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established.	0
ClaimBuster	11450	As far as college education is concerned, we need to make those student loans available.	0
ClaimBuster	11451	I'm not too popular sometimes with my own party, much less his.	0
ClaimBuster	11452	Now, I'd like to come back for a quick moment, if I can, to that issue about China and the talks.	0
ClaimBuster	11453	Maryland would not extradite Willie Horton, the man who was furloughed, the murderer, because they didn't want him to be furloughed again.	1
ClaimBuster	11454	And that additional 15 million barrels is going to cause scarcity.	0
ClaimBuster	11455	We had to go in when they came in.	0
ClaimBuster	11456	In Europe, we have massed troops as if the Soviet Union existed and was going to invade into Europe, but those days are over with.	0
ClaimBuster	11457	I might say the results are highly ambiguous.	0
ClaimBuster	11458	It may be a long period, but we must - we must get started immediately.	0
ClaimBuster	11459	Now, I think if we work together on it, and if you have a president that will work with the Congress and the American people, we can bring that deficit down steadily, $20, $25, $30 billion a year, build economic growth, build a good strong future for America, invest in those things which we must invest in economic development, good jobs, good schools for our kids, college opportunity for young people, decent health care and affordable housing, and a clean and safe environment.	0
ClaimBuster	11460	He said, if it's good enough for the congressmen and senators to have choice, seniors ought to have choice.	1
ClaimBuster	11461	And before you solve it, you have to say the name.	0
ClaimBuster	11462	That was the reason Congress gave him the authority to use force, not after excuse to get rid of the regime.	0
ClaimBuster	11463	You go into the inner cities and -- you see it's 45 percent poverty.	1
ClaimBuster	11464	Now, I also say that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, that, again, the question is not simply one of uh - a presidential veto stopping programs.	0
ClaimBuster	11465	But I believe together we can make great progress.	0
ClaimBuster	11466	There will be elections in January.	1
ClaimBuster	11467	So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform.	1
ClaimBuster	11468	You remember we increased that child credit by $1,000, reduced the marriage penalty, created a 10 percent tax bracket for the lower-income Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	11469	I just told this lady over here we spent -- went from $10 billion to $30 billion to protect the homeland.	1
ClaimBuster	11470	"When she was the head of their energy and natural resources board, she saw corruption, she resigned and said, ""This can't go on."""	1
ClaimBuster	11471	People's rights have been abused.	0
ClaimBuster	11472	And housing starts - he compares the housing starts with last year.	0
ClaimBuster	11473	But I also recognize that as the two great superpowers in the world, we have to live with each other.	0
ClaimBuster	11474	Not just at the high end.	0
ClaimBuster	11475	But she said she'll be awake.	1
ClaimBuster	11476	I have worked to support our country as the world's strongest force for peace and freedom, prosperity and security.	0
ClaimBuster	11477	What I want the voters to do is to make a decision.	0
ClaimBuster	11478	And we want to bring him to justice.	0
ClaimBuster	11479	And if Iraq were to fail, it'd be a haven for terrorists, and there would be money and the world would be much more dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	11480	So the work that we've done with respect to sanctions now offers Iran a choice.	1
ClaimBuster	11481	That's why we need a Democratic administration in Washington in 1989.	0
ClaimBuster	11482	I think the Atomic Energy Committee is prepared for it.	0
ClaimBuster	11483	And we can't do what Senator Obama wants to do.	0
ClaimBuster	11484	We have unbelievable -- we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet.	1
ClaimBuster	11485	I've worked hard to help families impart values to their own children.	0
ClaimBuster	11486	America needed to be safe.	0
ClaimBuster	11487	When Barbara holds an AIDS baby, she's showing a certain compassion for family; when she reads to children, the same thing.	0
ClaimBuster	11488	I have no quarrel whatsoever with the things that have been done, because I believe it is high time that the civilized countries of the world made it plain that there is no room worldwide for terrorism; there will be no negotiation with terrorists of any kind.	0
ClaimBuster	11489	We can do a better job of training the Iraqi forces to defend themselves, and I know that we can do a better job of preparing for elections.	0
ClaimBuster	11490	It would be a game changer.	0
ClaimBuster	11491	You got to send down some more people, because the president's found out there are death squads on his on his, in his own property.	1
ClaimBuster	11492	"We had a 20th-century mindset that basically said, ""Well, you know, he may be a dictator, but he's our dictator."""	0
ClaimBuster	11493	But I think the important thing--the important thing-- is to use the powers the president does have on the assumption that, given the condition of this economy, we're going to keep interest rates down if we have the discipline to increase investment and reduce the debt at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	11494	So if you analyze where we're out of line with other countries, you come up with the following conclusions.	0
ClaimBuster	11495	Now, we're now kidding anybody, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	11496	He voted against it and, obviously, we had to take Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait or it would've threatened the Middle Eastern world supply.	1
ClaimBuster	11497	But I would just say this.	0
ClaimBuster	11498	And that's why I'm sure that our brighter days are still ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	11499	She does not have a...	0
ClaimBuster	11500	And then I believe we should indicate our desire to live at peace with the world.	0
ClaimBuster	11501	And it's funny, but it's also really troubling.	0
ClaimBuster	11502	And we're protecting a couple of options in terms of modernizing our strategic forces.	0
ClaimBuster	11503	And I hope we can finally get it in the next session of Congress, because we need it badly.	0
ClaimBuster	11504	It'd be fine with me.	0
ClaimBuster	11505	But I would have no hesitation to ask the American people to pay the taxes even in l961 - if necessary - to maintain a sound economy and also to maintain a sound dollar.	0
ClaimBuster	11506	And I've been proud of their support and their recognition of my service to the veterans.	0
ClaimBuster	11507	The first I've -- who gave it that name?	0
ClaimBuster	11508	I'm not playing Lawrence Welk music tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	11509	And so we've got to reverse this.	0
ClaimBuster	11510	We have a depleted military.	1
ClaimBuster	11511	I will pay down the debt every single year until it is eliminated early in the next decade.	0
ClaimBuster	11512	I've just gotten a report from the Air Force that indicates that the 30-year lifecycle cost of that system is going to be $100 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	11513	I'm worried about overcommitting our military around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	11514	We've got to have a president that can lead on this issue, that can work with the Congress, and I'm prepared to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	11515	Uh - I think the Burger Court has confirmed that basic and very controversial decision of the Warren Court.	1
ClaimBuster	11516	And that's what I did with that vote.	0
ClaimBuster	11517	For me to have made such a statement would been in direct uh - opposition to that treaty.	0
ClaimBuster	11518	But you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently.	1
ClaimBuster	11519	I will be a president for all of our people.	0
ClaimBuster	11520	"They get on me -- Bill's gotten on me about, ""read my lips."""	0
ClaimBuster	11521	Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.	0
ClaimBuster	11522	So in my view, if you want to be protected, you ought to vote for Bob Dole and we'll get the instant check passed and we'll keep guns out of the hands of criminals.	0
ClaimBuster	11523	Well, we've taken the first step.	0
ClaimBuster	11524	We say we will defend it if it's part of a general attack on Formosa.	0
ClaimBuster	11525	Now, Gerald Ford left a five-year projected plan for a military build-up to restore our defenses, and President Carter's administration reduced that by 38%, cut 60 ships out of the Navy building program that had been proposed, and stopped the the B-l, delayed the cruise missile, stopped the production line for the Minuteman missile, stopped the Trident or delayed the Trident submarine, and now is planning a mobile military force that can be delivered to various spots in the world which does make me question his assaults on whether I am the one who is quick to look for use of force.	1
ClaimBuster	11526	And I'm proud to have been a part of an administration that has done exactly that.	0
ClaimBuster	11527	I think the President was correct, certainly, in his decision to continue the flights while the conference was going on.	0
ClaimBuster	11528	I think foreign aid needs to be used to encourage markets and reform.	0
ClaimBuster	11529	But if I look at the facts as a businessman, it's so tilted, the first thing you ought to do is just say, guys, if you like these deals so well, we'll give you the deal you gave us.	0
ClaimBuster	11530	Now, briefly, let me tell you how my prescription drug plan works.	0
ClaimBuster	11531	Well, he raised the question of my father -- it was a good line, well rehearsed and well delivered.	1
ClaimBuster	11532	So he may not be the right person to talk to.	0
ClaimBuster	11533	We have to have our people at work.	0
ClaimBuster	11534	And we used - yes, we used - the Senate Budget Committee's projections for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5% - which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated.	1
ClaimBuster	11535	I'm pleased the president made the decision he made.	0
ClaimBuster	11536	On the broad issue here, when you're trying to solve a problem, you get the best plans.	0
ClaimBuster	11537	And you asked a great question because it's not only seniors.	0
ClaimBuster	11538	I like Meg Whitman, she knows what it's like to be out there in the marketplace.	0
ClaimBuster	11539	I am in favor of tax cuts to encourage and give incentives for the quicker development of these new kinds of technologies.	0
ClaimBuster	11540	That's why I told you about the award he won from the National Journal.	1
ClaimBuster	11541	And that means that our aid that we provide to Pakistan is going to have to be conditioned upon certain benchmarks being met.	0
ClaimBuster	11542	This orgy of spending and enormous deficits you voted for almost all of his budgets.	1
ClaimBuster	11543	And if she ever wins this race, they won't be taken care of.	0
ClaimBuster	11544	Well, Katie (ph), thank you.	0
ClaimBuster	11545	Getting back to personal differences, I think, Jim, if you are a little more specific, but I think the President could clarify one thing tonight and that's the question of pardons.	0
ClaimBuster	11546	But they're not getting the $5,100 the president promised them.	1
ClaimBuster	11547	I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that's fine.	0
ClaimBuster	11548	And our goal in my administration would be to get all of the troops out of there with a minimal amount you need for training and logistics as we do in some other countries in the world after a war to be able to sustain the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	11549	Fixing our training programs for our workers.	0
ClaimBuster	11550	You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said -- he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie.	1
ClaimBuster	11551	He didn't have to, and he did, and we all appreciate it.	1
ClaimBuster	11552	This is going to take first, building a consensus at grassroots America.	0
ClaimBuster	11553	Secondly, I don't think we ought to be selling guns to people who shouldn't have them.	0
ClaimBuster	11554	One of his campaign people alleged that Prime Minister Allawi was like a puppet.	1
ClaimBuster	11555	I could not send soldiers into the north of Iraq, that would have been wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	11556	And the result is, we deployed, and the Soviets kept deploying, and then we negotiated from strength.	1
ClaimBuster	11557	And this -- I love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	11558	And I think I know what he meant by that.	0
ClaimBuster	11559	I'm going to pay for this later on.	0
ClaimBuster	11560	That was something I concurred with...	1
ClaimBuster	11561	President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud.	1
ClaimBuster	11562	The president just talked about Iraq as a center of the war on terror.	1
ClaimBuster	11563	That's the wrong way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	11564	The hemisphere is in our interest to have a peaceful Columbia.	0
ClaimBuster	11565	He's had experience in it.	1
ClaimBuster	11566	It's really true, even the ones that sometimes shake their fists at us.	0
ClaimBuster	11567	So what we have to do is two things.	0
ClaimBuster	11568	But there's a better way to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	11569	I have a long record on that, on a long series of reforms.	1
ClaimBuster	11570	That's the way you bring a deficit down and help to improve the quality of life for people at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	11571	But he has made -- not admitted a mistake and I just find it impossible to understand how an American can demonstrate against his own country in a foreign land -- organizing demonstrations against it when young men are held prisoner in Hanoi or kids out of the ghetto were drafted.	1
ClaimBuster	11572	That's the task of the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	11573	However many days that young girl in Florida stood in her classroom, however long, even if it was only one day, doesn't change the fact that there are a lot of overcrowded classrooms in America and we need to do something about that.	1
ClaimBuster	11574	But it's less than 1 percent of the total cost of health care.	1
ClaimBuster	11575	On drugs, I have repeatedly said drugs are wrong and illegal and can kill you.	1
ClaimBuster	11576	And that's something which will be a priority of ours in the new administration because without it, we cannot have the effective and strong and credible nuclear deterrent we must have.	0
ClaimBuster	11577	I believe we should study this and other allowances; tax expense, dividend expenses and all the rest, and make a determination of how we can stimulate growth; how we can provide the revenues needed to move our country forward.	0
ClaimBuster	11578	But Fannie and Freddie were the catalysts, the match that started this forest fire.	0
ClaimBuster	11579	Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago?	0
ClaimBuster	11580	But beyond that we need to address the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	11581	Daniel, I don't support a draft.	0
ClaimBuster	11582	Now, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad.	1
ClaimBuster	11583	I think marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman.	0
ClaimBuster	11584	And I don't agree with it.	0
ClaimBuster	11585	I said I would have the Secretary of Defense sit down.	1
ClaimBuster	11586	Iran has Iraq as one of its neighbors.	1
ClaimBuster	11587	Well, he does , he has a little bit, and I hope he will continue.	0
ClaimBuster	11588	Also I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments, and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education, and health care.	0
ClaimBuster	11589	I want to build on that.	0
ClaimBuster	11590	"He attacked the woman reporter writing the story, called her ""disgusting,"" as he has called a number of women during this campaign."	1
ClaimBuster	11591	We are better off than we were four years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	11592	If that's the case, then it will always be the best product that people can purchase.	0
ClaimBuster	11593	Well, all that I can suggest is that all the experts who have studied the program indicate that it is the most fantastic program, the worst program, insofar as its effect on the farmers, that the - America has ever had foisted upon it in an election year or any other time.	1
ClaimBuster	11594	I don't force you to do anything.	0
ClaimBuster	11595	And I think that's the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer.	0
ClaimBuster	11596	We're going the make great deals.	0
ClaimBuster	11597	We've been there a long time, and we've got to make sure that we and our coalition partners are pulling out responsibly and giving Afghans the capabilities that they need.	0
ClaimBuster	11598	He doesn't fix it for ten years.	1
ClaimBuster	11599	There is $2.3 trillion of surplus that we can use to make sure that younger workers have a Social Security plan in the future.	1
ClaimBuster	11600	We're going to make America safe again.	0
ClaimBuster	11601	And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.	1
ClaimBuster	11602	Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won't take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario.	1
ClaimBuster	11603	That, however, is not my only passion.	0
ClaimBuster	11604	There have been only six cases brought by this Attorney General under the voting bill passed in 1957 and the voting bill passed in 1960.	1
ClaimBuster	11605	And that's to be honored.	0
ClaimBuster	11606	Let me just give you one tiny example.	0
ClaimBuster	11607	I want a top down review to determine what our priorities are and what we should do in defense, and then follow that policy instead of this bottom up review with all the services fighting for the money.	0
ClaimBuster	11608	And that's what we're doing.	1
ClaimBuster	11609	We expect there to be standards met and we expect there to be measurement.	0
ClaimBuster	11610	She and her son Bryan, they came to see me.	1
ClaimBuster	11611	It means looking (ph) at the spending side, but also at the revenue side.	0
ClaimBuster	11612	But Washington is a tough town.	0
ClaimBuster	11613	"I mean, ""compassionate conservative,"" what does that mean?"	0
ClaimBuster	11614	But more importantly, with respect to the question of no record, I helped write -- I did write, I was one of the original authors of the early childhood health care and the expansion of health care that we did in the middle of the 1990s.	1
ClaimBuster	11615	But I'm all for NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	11616	And God bless them, every one of them decided on their own to come here this evening.	1
ClaimBuster	11617	And if they are, fine.	0
ClaimBuster	11618	Let me say this to you, I wouldn't use force.	0
ClaimBuster	11619	Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share.	1
ClaimBuster	11620	And that's not going to happen by just hiring teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	11621	I will fight tooth and nail to pass the minimum wage.	0
ClaimBuster	11622	So when you bring those rates down, those small businesses are able to keep more money and hire more people.	1
ClaimBuster	11623	But that's Senate inside baseball.	0
ClaimBuster	11624	I can tell him some I'm against.	0
ClaimBuster	11625	He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen.	1
ClaimBuster	11626	It shouldn't be politicized in any way by the President or by his opponent.	0
ClaimBuster	11627	"The truth of that matter is, if you listen carefully, Saddam would still be in power if he were the president of the United States, ""And the world would be a lot better off."""	0
ClaimBuster	11628	In a little school everybody is somebody; individualism is very important.	0
ClaimBuster	11629	But let's come back to something the president and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it's more affordable for families.	0
ClaimBuster	11630	I am not parsing words.	0
ClaimBuster	11631	Obamacare was the first step.	0
ClaimBuster	11632	Well, his campaign manager, who used to be the secretary of the treasury, was taking great credit about a year ago and asking and receiving from the Congress substantial additional funds to hire internal revenue agents to go out and collect these funds, and I'm happy to join Jim Baker in saying that we agree on this.	1
ClaimBuster	11633	That's why, in my plan, I add two active duty divisions to the United States Army, not for Iraq, but for our general demands across the globe.	0
ClaimBuster	11634	It was a big, big mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	11635	94% comes from the local level.	1
ClaimBuster	11636	She negotiated with the oil companies and faced them down, a $40 billion pipeline of natural gas that's going to relieve the energy needs of the United -- of what they call the lower 48.	1
ClaimBuster	11637	And this strategy, and this general, they are winning.	0
ClaimBuster	11638	We need to deny them the safe havens.	0
ClaimBuster	11639	Unfortunately, the economy is not stronger.	0
ClaimBuster	11640	But it was a terrible recession.	0
ClaimBuster	11641	Since I've been in office, we've had a steady, carefully planned, methodical but, very effective increase in our commitment for defense.	1
ClaimBuster	11642	The Arab countries have a stake in not having a civil war.	0
ClaimBuster	11643	You know, we have 17,000 men and women today wearing our uniform that receive food stamps.	1
ClaimBuster	11644	And, by the way, Senator Obama has never mentioned how much that fine might be.	1
ClaimBuster	11645	I don't say the Democrats are united in their support of the program.	0
ClaimBuster	11646	And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information.	1
ClaimBuster	11647	It would've called for export controls on agricultural products In my judgment the best way to get jobs is to uh - expand the private sector, where five out of six jobs today exist in our economy.	1
ClaimBuster	11648	Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.	1
ClaimBuster	11649	Why the deficits are so much of a problem for him now, but that in 1976, when the deficit was $52 billion and everyone was panicking about that, he said, no, that he thought it ought to be bigger, because a bigger deficit would stimulate the economy and would help do away with unemployment.	1
ClaimBuster	11650	I want to change many of its provisions.	0
ClaimBuster	11651	And for the last eight years I've served on the National Security Council.	1
ClaimBuster	11652	I want, Joe, you to do the job.	0
ClaimBuster	11653	Now, leaders will always make mistakes.	0
ClaimBuster	11654	In Iraq, we'll be having free elections, and a free society will make this world more peaceful.	0
ClaimBuster	11655	I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don't get in the hands of people that shouldn't have them.	0
ClaimBuster	11656	Let's don't -- you don't have to believe it.	0
ClaimBuster	11657	And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck.	0
ClaimBuster	11658	He has gradually repressed most of the liberties that we would expect for nations to observe, and he has exhibited most aggressive behavior, obviously, in Georgia.	0
ClaimBuster	11659	Now, my problem is -- I heard what he said.	0
ClaimBuster	11660	Yes, we shouldn't trade arms for hostages.	0
ClaimBuster	11661	What message does that send to our allies?	0
ClaimBuster	11662	And the consequence is that federal portion or federal money will go to the parent, so the parent can go to a tutoring program or another public school or another private school.	1
ClaimBuster	11663	You know, I think the American people deserve credit for the great economy that we have.	0
ClaimBuster	11664	I wish I knew the law because I would darn sure sign it.	0
ClaimBuster	11665	Some of them I voted for.	1
ClaimBuster	11666	And when I roll it back and we invest in the things that I have talked about to move our economy, we're going to grow sufficiently, it would begin to cut the deficit in half, and we get back to where we were at the end of the 1990s when we balanced the budget and paid down the debt of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	11667	(chuckle) Well, in the first place, I'm not criticizing His Holiness the Pope.	0
ClaimBuster	11668	meeting a condemnation of Russian infiltration of Cuba.	0
ClaimBuster	11669	This Thursday night on ABC from 8:30 to 9, Friday night on NBC from 8 to 8:30, and Saturday night on CBS from 8 to 8:30, we'll be down in the trenches under the hood working on fixin' the old car to get it back on the road.	0
ClaimBuster	11670	That is the obligation upon our generation.	0
ClaimBuster	11671	And for those of you working, thanks from the bottom of my heart.	0
ClaimBuster	11672	I know how to make that happen.	0
ClaimBuster	11673	But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.	0
ClaimBuster	11674	The President says he wants to eliminate or reduce the number of nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	11675	Trying to find my light.	0
ClaimBuster	11676	And she could have done this years ago, by the way.	0
ClaimBuster	11677	All she's done is talk to the African-Americans and to the Latinos, but they get the vote, and then they come back, they say, we'll see you in four years.	0
ClaimBuster	11678	And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall.	1
ClaimBuster	11679	I have been in politics for some time, and I worry about the people who don't vote.	0
ClaimBuster	11680	I think when you make that decision, it might be well if you would ask yourself, are you better off than you were four years ago?	0
ClaimBuster	11681	So I want to proceed carefully to cover more people.	0
ClaimBuster	11682	Our bill was far more effective.	0
ClaimBuster	11683	Who are we to say, well, under certain circumstances, it's all right, but under other circumstances it isn't?	0
ClaimBuster	11684	Well, I believe that conservation, at course, is worthy in and of itself.	0
ClaimBuster	11685	And indeed, every time it has increased you will find there is an increase in minority unemployment among young people.	1
ClaimBuster	11686	This was not a way to pay down the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	11687	It is so sad when you see what's happened.	0
ClaimBuster	11688	I know this, 100% will get it if I'm the president.	0
ClaimBuster	11689	To say that we are limited, and at a dangerous point in this country with regard to energy, I think, is to ignore the fact.	0
ClaimBuster	11690	Let's limit some of these guys sitting out here tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	11691	I don't use language like that and I don't think that we should.	0
ClaimBuster	11692	He stood on principle standing up to the Soviet Union, and we won that conflict.	1
ClaimBuster	11693	So I'll let the American people decide, judge, who's going to be more effective and more credible when it comes to imposing crippling sanctions.	0
ClaimBuster	11694	In policies that will lift wages and will grow our middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	11695	And the $650 isn't even on that.	0
ClaimBuster	11696	I was chairman of it once.	1
ClaimBuster	11697	It's not a lot of money relative to what I had.	0
ClaimBuster	11698	We'll have specific differences later.	0
ClaimBuster	11699	When they raise your taxes nobody runs around asking people where are you going to get the extra money.	0
ClaimBuster	11700	And Senator Obama, by saying that he would attack Pakistan, look at the context of his words.	0
ClaimBuster	11701	It's God's will, it'll happen.	0
ClaimBuster	11702	And I don't believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care of not.	0
ClaimBuster	11703	I'll tell you another way to help protect America in the long run is to continue with missile defenses.	0
ClaimBuster	11704	I -- I was -- I was someone who ran businesses for 25 years, and balanced the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	11705	We need to reach out to moderate Arab nations as well to build coalitions to keep the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	11706	So here's what I've done since I've been president.	0
ClaimBuster	11707	So far, Mr. Ford has not done it.	1
ClaimBuster	11708	I've tried to use the White House as a bully pulpit, speaking out against discrimination.	0
ClaimBuster	11709	It's really a matter of culture.	0
ClaimBuster	11710	In the last four months alone, five hundred thousand Americans have gone on the unemployment roll.	1
ClaimBuster	11711	But you have to work together.	0
ClaimBuster	11712	And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide.	0
ClaimBuster	11713	We've achieved an arms control agreement that our critics thought was never possible and I want to build on it.	1
ClaimBuster	11714	And in his tax plan, you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out.	1
ClaimBuster	11715	Once you have that understanding and mutual respect, then we can transcend the differences and embrace the highest common denominator of the American spirit.	0
ClaimBuster	11716	I think we all recall with some sadness that at uh - the period of the nin- late nineteen forties, early nineteen fifties, there were some indications that the United States would not include uh - South Korea in an area of defense.	0
ClaimBuster	11717	Keep my promises to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	11718	As far as health care is concerned, obviously, everyone is struggling to make sure that they can afford their premiums and that they can have affordable and available health care.	0
ClaimBuster	11719	But they've got to have a strong basic economy and if you're in debt, it's like having a ball and chain around you.	0
ClaimBuster	11720	We all understand what this country has become because talent from all around the world wants to come here.	0
ClaimBuster	11721	He's praised George Bush as a good economic steward and Dick Cheney as somebody who's -- who shows great wisdom and judgment.	1
ClaimBuster	11722	And that's why I'll be a better commander in chief.	0
ClaimBuster	11723	When you talk to those bankers, did they discuss where interest rates were when your party controlled the White House?	0
ClaimBuster	11724	One's in technical school, one's an honor student in high school.	1
ClaimBuster	11725	We have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	11726	And, finally, we've got to go out there and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren't being paid to this country.	1
ClaimBuster	11727	He's arranged for me to spend a lot more time with Senator D'Amato in the last couple years so I'm more familiar with his comments than I used to be.	1
ClaimBuster	11728	This attitude is extremely dangerous and belligerent in its tone, although it's said with a quiet voice.	0
ClaimBuster	11729	If the president's energy policies are working, you're going to see the cost of energy come down.	1
ClaimBuster	11730	Will he join me in suggesting that we may need another plant?	0
ClaimBuster	11731	And that is what I call a flexible freeze that allows growth about 4 percent or the rate of inflation but does not permit the Congress just to add on spending.	0
ClaimBuster	11732	But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts?	0
ClaimBuster	11733	Take a look at the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	11734	Now, we have to take measured steps because the sentiment within Serbia is, for understandable reasons, against the United States because their nationalism -- even if they don't like Milosevic, they still have some feelings lingering from the NATO action there.	0
ClaimBuster	11735	And for every dollar that I spend in those two categories, I'll put $2 toward paying down the national debt.	0
ClaimBuster	11736	We have to have all of the above, alternative fuels, wind, tide, solar, natural gas, clean coal technology.	0
ClaimBuster	11737	I've learned to feed myself and to walk and to dress.	1
ClaimBuster	11738	And we've got to begin early, in the first, second and third grade, before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very, very dangerous substances.	0
ClaimBuster	11739	I have seen four wars in my lifetime.	1
ClaimBuster	11740	He has surrounded himself with former KGB apparatchiks.	1
ClaimBuster	11741	Now, as to why I should be and he shouldn't be, when he was a candidate in 1976, President Carter invented a thing he called the misery index.	1
ClaimBuster	11742	I know what it means to see people who are unemployed.	0
ClaimBuster	11743	That's an interruption, by the way.	1
ClaimBuster	11744	But character is an important part of the equation.	0
ClaimBuster	11745	The point is that as we look at this nation's future, and we have two very different visions of this future.	0
ClaimBuster	11746	Well, I said a few minutes ago, Peter, that you could improve the lives of families and youngsters and save money at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	11747	It's a record they think they can play that everybody loves to hear.	0
ClaimBuster	11748	He not only advocates the scrapping of this treaty - and I don't know that these men that he quotes are against the treaty in its final form - but he also advocates the possibility, he said it's been a missing element, of playing a trump card against the Soviet Union of a nuclear arms race, and is insisting upon nuclear superiority by our own nation, as a predication for negotiation in the future with the Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	11749	We are spending that surplus to make the deficit look smaller to you than it really is.	1
ClaimBuster	11750	And of course, what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut Social Security benefits by 25 percent -- reducing the adjustment for inflation, cutting out minimum benefits for the poorest on Social Security, removing educational benefits for dependents whose widows were trying -- with widows trying to get them through college.	1
ClaimBuster	11751	But there was fortunately others beside myself who believed that we ought to take action.	0
ClaimBuster	11752	And that's why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I've spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families.	1
ClaimBuster	11753	I would hope an incident like that would not happen.	0
ClaimBuster	11754	I appreciate the quote from the young man.	0
ClaimBuster	11755	What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	11756	But on all of these things, a sound economy is the only way to get it going.	0
ClaimBuster	11757	We need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition.	0
ClaimBuster	11758	And when those rich corporations don't pay that tax, the average American taxpayer pays it for 'em.	0
ClaimBuster	11759	And I don't think it's uh - the Congress is Mr. Ford's opponent; but if uh - if - if he insists that uh - that I be responsible for the Democratic Congress, of which I'm - have not been a part, then I think it's only fair that he be responsible for the Nixon administration in its entirety, of which he was a part.	1
ClaimBuster	11760	But to indicate in advance how we would respond, to indicate the nature of this response would be incorrect; it would certainly be inappropriate; it would not be in the best interests of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	11761	They also have cut two billion dollars off of defense.	1
ClaimBuster	11762	See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.	0
ClaimBuster	11763	And then, Helen, I really believe where people are going to ask this question about trust, because I do think there's a pattern by Governor Clinton of saying one thing to please one group, and then trying to please another group.	1
ClaimBuster	11764	It's the law-abiding citizens who will do that.	0
ClaimBuster	11765	I'll be glad to answer any question you have, but this election ought to be about the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	11766	Defense industries are going to have to convert to civilian industries.	0
ClaimBuster	11767	I know a lot of them that aren't working.	1
ClaimBuster	11768	Now, we can do that.	0
ClaimBuster	11769	We can't simply be focused on Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	11770	I noticed also in The Wall Street Journal early this week, that a preliminary report of his task force advocates making Social Security more sound by reducing the adjustment in Social Security for the retired people to compensate for the impact of inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	11771	Number one, we are going to have North American energy independence.	0
ClaimBuster	11772	I want to see peace.	0
ClaimBuster	11773	It's time for America to find new leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	11774	Now, Governor Romney will say he's got an all-of-the-above plan, but basically his plan is to let the oil companies write the energy policies.	1
ClaimBuster	11775	And what I don't like is trickle down government.	0
ClaimBuster	11776	And when I'm president, I will.	0
ClaimBuster	11777	But I want to give every American family a $5,000 refundable tax credit.	0
ClaimBuster	11778	And I intend to win it as President of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	11779	But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well.	0
ClaimBuster	11780	And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	11781	He must stand for the values of decency that the American people stand for, and he must use the power of the White House to try to control these nuclear weapons and lead this world toward a safer world.	0
ClaimBuster	11782	The inflation rate under Kennedy and Johnson was about 2 percent - one-third what it is under this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	11783	Now, I don't think that's a bad idea.	0
ClaimBuster	11784	First let me just say one comment about what the vice president said.	0
ClaimBuster	11785	You've done a great job.	0
ClaimBuster	11786	Now, the last thing I think we have to focus on is a little bit of history, just so that we understand what we're doing going forward.	0
ClaimBuster	11787	It's a black church just outside of Washington, DC.	1
ClaimBuster	11788	It was part of our other economic plan.	1
ClaimBuster	11789	And, lastly, not to deal with the PLO until and unless the PLO recognizes Israel's right to exist and recognizes UN Resolution 242 as a basis for Middle East peace.	0
ClaimBuster	11790	And he's been proposing all kinds of programs for new spending costing billions.	1
ClaimBuster	11791	Nine million people lost their jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	11792	I think that we have a long way to go, regrettably.	0
ClaimBuster	11793	And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started.	1
ClaimBuster	11794	And when she said irredeemable, they're irredeemable, you didn't mention that, but when she said they're irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse.	0
ClaimBuster	11795	But to state my view precisely, the president should have a variety of things he could do.	0
ClaimBuster	11796	One of his big ideas when it comes to corporate tax reform would be to say, if you invest overseas, you make profits overseas, you don't have to pay U.S. taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	11797	But it does seem to me that you've raised a very important point that needs to be addressed.	0
ClaimBuster	11798	And I mean investing in education, health care, the environment, and middle-class tax cuts and retirement security.	0
ClaimBuster	11799	If we fail then, if we're unable to come to an agreement - and I hope we can come to an agreement because it does not merely involve now the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union as atomic powers.	0
ClaimBuster	11800	In the nature of a campaign, it seems that some campaigns are focused on attacking a person rather than prescribing their own future and the things they'd like to do.	0
ClaimBuster	11801	One, get us energy independent, North American energy independent.	0
ClaimBuster	11802	And the world needs a strong America, and it is stronger now than when I came into office.	0
ClaimBuster	11803	It was due to go bankrupt in 1999 and that 50 million figure again, the newspapers -- I said -- you said forget the journalists, but they are the keepers of the score card and whether or not you're using facts that aren't right.	1
ClaimBuster	11804	Let me pay a compliment to the president, if I may.	0
ClaimBuster	11805	Mr. Bush wants to spend billions and trillions on Star Wars.	0
ClaimBuster	11806	I have supported the Administration's position and I think that that position has been correct; I think my position has been correct.	0
ClaimBuster	11807	But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.	0
ClaimBuster	11808	An administration which wants to billions on weapons systems that we don't need and can't afford, and now confronts us with a very serious problem, and plants that are supposed to be producing tritium and plutonium and providing the necessary materials for existing weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	11809	We can create jobs that pay more than the jobs we're losing overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	11810	I regret what's happened in these past months.	0
ClaimBuster	11811	And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away.	0
ClaimBuster	11812	And the fact is, while we were coordinating an international coalition to make sure these sanctions were effective, you were still invested in a Chinese state oil company that was doing business with the Iranian oil sector.	1
ClaimBuster	11813	I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time.	1
ClaimBuster	11814	My father was a senator who strongly opposed the Vietnam War.	1
ClaimBuster	11815	The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth.	1
ClaimBuster	11816	And if you want a tough President who uses that strength to get arms control and draws the line in the heavens, vote for Walter Mondale.	0
ClaimBuster	11817	And it's great to be with you again.	0
ClaimBuster	11818	And then all the liberal columnists join in.	0
ClaimBuster	11819	This is a -- this is a tax in and of itself.	0
ClaimBuster	11820	Instead of listening to him, they retired him.	1
ClaimBuster	11821	It's a $1 million loan.	1
ClaimBuster	11822	We also need to continue to index Social Security payments, so that if inflation rises, the Social Security payments would rise a commensurate degree to let the buying power of a Social Security check continue intact.	0
ClaimBuster	11823	It was fortunately stopped in its tracks.	1
ClaimBuster	11824	We will continue to stay on the offense.	0
ClaimBuster	11825	I invite the American people tomorrow -- because I will issue the statement quoting President Reagan -- he said exactly what I said he said.	0
ClaimBuster	11826	We organized the Friends of Syria.	1
ClaimBuster	11827	Well I -- I absolutely believe that America has a -- a responsibility, and the privilege of helping defend freedom and promote the principles that -- that make the world more peaceful.	0
ClaimBuster	11828	I mentioned health care earlier.	1
ClaimBuster	11829	And we're on the hunt for him.	1
ClaimBuster	11830	There's only one of us on this stage who's actually shipped jobs to Mexico, because that's Donald.	1
ClaimBuster	11831	But I think our hold uh - of support among those who uh - are crucial to the election has been fairly steady.	0
ClaimBuster	11832	And I believe that is the way you get the deficit down, not by the tax-and-spend program that we hear every 4 years, whether it's Mondale, Dukakis, whoever else it is.	0
ClaimBuster	11833	I'd just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get.	0
ClaimBuster	11834	But I think it was a terrible thing to say.	0
ClaimBuster	11835	I'm a son of Detroit.	1
ClaimBuster	11836	So here's what I would do.	0
ClaimBuster	11837	They interviewed all of my children's friends from childhood on.	1
ClaimBuster	11838	And maybe you need somebody up there who understands when you're getting your pocket picked.	0
ClaimBuster	11839	But I do believe that we ought to talk plainly to the Hollywood moguls and people who produce this stuff and explain the consequences.	0
ClaimBuster	11840	Let me also say, we're having an election today.	1
ClaimBuster	11841	I want to address my remarks to the young people of America, because they're the ones that are going to spend most of their life in the 21st Century.	1
ClaimBuster	11842	If you're middle income, you're about where you were.	0
ClaimBuster	11843	Well, like everyone else, I've spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw.	0
ClaimBuster	11844	If Missouri, just given the number of people from Missouri who are in the military over there today, were a country, it would be the third largest country in the coalition, behind Great Britain and the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	11845	And very little of what Governor Romney just said is true.	0
ClaimBuster	11846	We cannot be the policeman for the world any longer.	0
ClaimBuster	11847	The average South Korean is three inches taller than the average North Korean, a huge gulag.	1
ClaimBuster	11848	I voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly, because I think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control and it is on that vote that th- Mr. Nixon and I disagreed, and his tie vote uh - defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	11849	And we will do it with the highest moral principles.	0
ClaimBuster	11850	I would be interested to see if he would say this evening he'll put Medicare in a lockbox.	0
ClaimBuster	11851	We've got, I think -- you know, you think about women in government, I think about women in business.	0
ClaimBuster	11852	The United States has kept the peace -- the United States has kept the peace through our alliances.	1
ClaimBuster	11853	And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this.	0
ClaimBuster	11854	We have to be competitive if we're going to create more jobs here.	0
ClaimBuster	11855	I agree: Education is key, particularly the future of our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	11856	You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess.	0
ClaimBuster	11857	Create more jobs and opportunities for people on and off welfare.	0
ClaimBuster	11858	And we are going to continue to keep the pressure on to make sure that they do not get a nuclear weapon.	0
ClaimBuster	11859	And let the world know - that's very important.	0
ClaimBuster	11860	But I would like to shift, if I could, to the big issue of education.	0
ClaimBuster	11861	Hey, I've got to answer that, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	11862	It's just the right position to take.	0
ClaimBuster	11863	But when you keep star-warring it -- I never suggested where the weapons should be or what kind; I'm not a scientist.	1
ClaimBuster	11864	But -- but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I'll release my returns.	0
ClaimBuster	11865	We're going to have to do some things that are quite costly.	0
ClaimBuster	11866	These are a few of the things to which our nation is committed, and we will continue with these commitments.	0
ClaimBuster	11867	But I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	11868	So that's how I've used my travels, when I travel to Israel and when I travel to the region.	1
ClaimBuster	11869	It is such a great question and it's maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense.	0
ClaimBuster	11870	You can't add billions of dollars to our expenditures and not pay for it.	0
ClaimBuster	11871	I think the administration did the right thing in that case.	0
ClaimBuster	11872	We believe that we had also promised that we would make our country more secure.	0
ClaimBuster	11873	That's why I strongly supported the Motor Voter law.	1
ClaimBuster	11874	And what's that going to do?	0
ClaimBuster	11875	The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity, as I've said, and that has not been changed.	0
ClaimBuster	11876	So here's what we have to do comprehensively, though.	0
ClaimBuster	11877	And yet, his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation, because in January, at the beginning of the year, it was more than 18%.	1
ClaimBuster	11878	And so we need military strength, we need economic strength, we also need the right diplomatic policies.	0
ClaimBuster	11879	Now, Senator Obama without precondition wants to sit down and negotiate with them, without preconditions.	0
ClaimBuster	11880	And judgment is what we look for in the president of the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	11881	So I think people are going to be looking for trust and experience.	0
ClaimBuster	11882	Let's talk about programs for children.	0
ClaimBuster	11883	I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything.	0
ClaimBuster	11884	We have seen on Capitol Hill, in the Congress, uh - a great many uh - allegations of wrong-doing, of uh - alleged immorality, uh - those are very disturbing to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	11885	Whether it be opposition to spending and earmarks, whether it be the issue of torture, whether it be the conduct of the war in Iraq, which I vigorously opposed.	1
ClaimBuster	11886	I have believed that in the appointment of judges that all that was specified in the party platform was that they respect the sanctity of human life.	0
ClaimBuster	11887	And, as well, we're pursuing a strategy of freedom around the world, because I understand free nations will reject terror.	0
ClaimBuster	11888	Now lastly, I believe in the case of Little Rock.	0
ClaimBuster	11889	And if it is, I appreciate it congratulate you.	0
ClaimBuster	11890	Every free economy has good regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	11891	We've had an increase in taxes paid by individuals, payroll taxes, from14 Percent up to 20 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	11892	If -- if we're serious, we've got to take a balanced, responsible approach.	0
ClaimBuster	11893	Now, isn't it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child, and it was abortion and not murder, but if somebody else does it, that's murder?	0
ClaimBuster	11894	You know, it's so easy now to say, hey, cut out foreign aid, we got a problem at home.	0
ClaimBuster	11895	They hit middle- and moderate-income Americans and leave wealthy Americans largely untouched.	1
ClaimBuster	11896	Now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down.	1
ClaimBuster	11897	So our troops will come home at that point.	1
ClaimBuster	11898	If you notice that in all of this proposal, Senator -- government wants -- Senator Obama wants government to do the job.	1
ClaimBuster	11899	You know he calls it an outsourcing to keep -- stop outsourcing.	0
ClaimBuster	11900	That's where the problem is and I hope there'll be some corrective action taken so we can get some new leadership in the Congress of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	11901	But I couldn't completely neglect the beauty around me -- the Pacific out there on one side of the highway, shining in the sunlight, the mountains of the coast range rising on the other side.	0
ClaimBuster	11902	We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow, whether because of age or need.	0
ClaimBuster	11903	But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas.	0
ClaimBuster	11904	And the way to defeat them long-term, by the way, is to spread freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	11905	That's by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced.	0
ClaimBuster	11906	Whereas I have proposed we ought to take.	0
ClaimBuster	11907	And I don't want to see the banks let off the hook.	0
ClaimBuster	11908	If I couldn't cut taxes and balance the budget the same time, I wouldn't look at you in the eye in your living room or wherever you might be and say that this is good for America.	0
ClaimBuster	11909	And here's my tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	11910	It's a matter of morality.	0
ClaimBuster	11911	And then somehow you're also going to deal with the deficit that we've already got.	0
ClaimBuster	11912	They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents.	0
ClaimBuster	11913	And that means, for example, standing up for human rights.	0
ClaimBuster	11914	Give me a chance to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	11915	It's a very sacred contract, and I believe in it.	0
ClaimBuster	11916	That's why I fight to clean up the environment and protect this earth.	0
ClaimBuster	11917	I'm sure that you appreciate that.	0
ClaimBuster	11918	And the schools that are not chosen are improved -- competition does that.	0
ClaimBuster	11919	And I miss going to church, but I think the Lord understands.	0
ClaimBuster	11920	I understand that I can get this country on track again.	0
ClaimBuster	11921	And the last thing I wanna make is this.	0
ClaimBuster	11922	I've seen the family values of all these people in America who are out there killing themselves working harder for less in a country that's had the worst economic years in 50 years and the first decline in industrial production ever.	1
ClaimBuster	11923	But when it came time to making sure that Gadhafi did not stay in power, that he was captured, Governor, your suggestion was that this was mission creep, that this was mission muddle.	1
ClaimBuster	11924	I think we ought to be forgiving Third World debt under certain conditions.	0
ClaimBuster	11925	So I'm satisfied with it.	0
ClaimBuster	11926	He doesn't understand that Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia.	1
ClaimBuster	11927	I was on the world of business for 25 years.	1
ClaimBuster	11928	I've been saying that for over a year now.	1
ClaimBuster	11929	The vice president thinks it's the government's money.	0
ClaimBuster	11930	But the key thing is to make sure you can get a job when you get out of school.	0
ClaimBuster	11931	And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns.	1
ClaimBuster	11932	I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates.	0
ClaimBuster	11933	The Soviet Union knows what they want in detente, and they've been getting it.	0
ClaimBuster	11934	Now also, with regard to the figures about California.	0
ClaimBuster	11935	This is particularly true of the recent efforts to shut down part of Alaska.	1
ClaimBuster	11936	And I don't intend to politicize it.	0
ClaimBuster	11937	I support charter schools and pay for performance for teachers.	1
ClaimBuster	11938	I don't believe it does.	0
ClaimBuster	11939	I will bring fresh credibility, a new start, and we will get the job done right.	0
ClaimBuster	11940	All of us ought to be involved with programs that provide a viable alternative to abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	11941	Mr. Vice President, thank you very much, and I would like to thank the folks here at Wake Forest, and I want to thank you all for listening.	0
ClaimBuster	11942	Instead we had, I think, in the second quarter, a Consumer Price Index registering around 12%.	1
ClaimBuster	11943	If we build up the hopes of the world by having a summit conference that is not adequately prepared, and then, if Mr. Khrushchev finds some excuse for breaking it up - as he did this one - because he isn't going to get his way - we'd set back the cause of peace.	0
ClaimBuster	11944	I do know what affirmative action means.	0
ClaimBuster	11945	I think the foremost (Applause)	0
ClaimBuster	11946	The only thing we're going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you.	0
ClaimBuster	11947	They don't let me get away with anything.	0
ClaimBuster	11948	We differ on the kinds of appointments that we would make.	0
ClaimBuster	11949	And I've had a consistent record ever since 1965.	1
ClaimBuster	11950	Former Governor Racicot, as chairman of the Republican Party, said he thought that the Patriot Act has to be changed and fixed.	1
ClaimBuster	11951	Now I don't know what Senator Kennedy suggests when he says that we should help those who oppose the Castro regime, both in Cuba and without.	0
ClaimBuster	11952	Let's put health records online, that will reduce medical errors, as they call them.	0
ClaimBuster	11953	Then year after year for decades, they will have jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	11954	We are the sole remaining superpower, and we should be that.	0
ClaimBuster	11955	I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.	1
ClaimBuster	11956	Now, I won't mention their names, because they're rich, but they're not famous.	1
ClaimBuster	11957	It's well-known that I have not been elected Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate nor with the administration.	1
ClaimBuster	11958	The president says that I'm denigrating these troops.	1
ClaimBuster	11959	The plan says there will be elections in January, and there will be.	1
ClaimBuster	11960	Well, thank you for asking your question.	0
ClaimBuster	11961	The president needed the authority to use force in order to be able to get him to do something, because he never did it without the threat of force.	1
ClaimBuster	11962	We still have the strictest air control, or air pollution laws in the country.	1
ClaimBuster	11963	That, to me, was so hurtful.	0
ClaimBuster	11964	Every Republican on the Rules Committee voted against sending that bill to be considered by the members of the House of Representatives.	1
ClaimBuster	11965	I believe that the way in which I will approach the Presidency is what's needed, because all my life that has been the way in which I have sought to lead.	0
ClaimBuster	11966	We've got to help them.	0
ClaimBuster	11967	You've got to show you're serious in that regard.	0
ClaimBuster	11968	And by two to one, Congress is blamed for these deficits.	1
ClaimBuster	11969	I didn't question the man's patriotism.	0
ClaimBuster	11970	We're going to do that with a more aggressive trade policy.	0
ClaimBuster	11971	It was $200 billion deficit instead.	1
ClaimBuster	11972	He said that by now middle-income families would have a reduction in their health insurance premiums by $2,500 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	11973	Senator Hagel of Nebraska said that the handling of Iraq is beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing; it's in the zone of dangerous.	1
ClaimBuster	11974	I broke with my party in order to balance the budget, and Ronald Reagan signed into law the tax cut that we voted for.	1
ClaimBuster	11975	So, yeah, I think -- I do think it's time.	0
ClaimBuster	11976	Small business--you've got to have capital, you've got to credit, and many of them need mentors or coaches.	0
ClaimBuster	11977	Well, the United States uh - has on occasion attempted uh - mostly in the middle fifties, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to pull his troops back to Formosa.	1
ClaimBuster	11978	It would be a game-changer in the region.	0
ClaimBuster	11979	This is a very serious problem in our country, and it has to be dealt with.	0
ClaimBuster	11980	And I believe the answer to the agricultural economy is not to get the government further involved, but to do what I'm suggesting.	0
ClaimBuster	11981	We were proud of them.	0
ClaimBuster	11982	I can say this: I do not believe Yassir Arafat wants us to send troops to the West Bank.	0
ClaimBuster	11983	You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails?	0
ClaimBuster	11984	Well, I've listened to both sides, and if they would talk to one another instead of throwing rocks, I think we could get a lot done.	0
ClaimBuster	11985	Senator Obama's secret that you don't know is that his tax increases will increase taxes on 50 percent of small business revenue.	1
ClaimBuster	11986	And as a result, our nation paid a price.	0
ClaimBuster	11987	You were offered a chance to join.	1
ClaimBuster	11988	I'm from a big farm state.	1
ClaimBuster	11989	We have a concept called the New American School Corporation where we're doing exactly that.	1
ClaimBuster	11990	So these are the combination of things I want, and the fact that I don't think the federal government can endorse a $35 billion program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program.	0
ClaimBuster	11991	I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden.	1
ClaimBuster	11992	But it's extremely difficult to make that judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	11993	Secondly, the Vice President mentioned medical care for the aged.	1
ClaimBuster	11994	I'm asking for your vote.	0
ClaimBuster	11995	What I would do is to bring in the pension experts of the country, take a look at it, and strengthen the pension requirements further, because it's not just enough to have the guarantee.	0
ClaimBuster	11996	I want to control our own energy by developing oil and natural gas but also the energy sources of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	11997	Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.	0
ClaimBuster	11998	And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.	0
ClaimBuster	11999	You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund.	1
ClaimBuster	12000	I've been involved, as I mentioned to you before, in virtually every major national security challenge we've faced in the last 20-some years.	1
ClaimBuster	12001	I don't know where that money would come from.	0
ClaimBuster	12002	And I've seen at first hand, in a very vivid way, the deep hurt that's come to this country in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia, Chile, and Pakistan, and Angola, and Watergate, CIA revelations.	0
ClaimBuster	12003	And I said, what can we do about it.	0
ClaimBuster	12004	You're not going to find a quote from me.	0
ClaimBuster	12005	And they've also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it's not me.	0
ClaimBuster	12006	Osama bin Laden doesn't get to decide.	0
ClaimBuster	12007	I'm concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	12008	We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.	0
ClaimBuster	12009	I'm sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality.	0
ClaimBuster	12010	And therefore, the President's judgment has been that we should defend the islands if, in his military judgment and the judgment of the commander in the field, the attack on these islands should be part of an overall attack on Formosa.	1
ClaimBuster	12011	They write me, and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix.	1
ClaimBuster	12012	The Miranda case, uh - the Burger Court uh - is gradually changing, and I'm pleased to see that there are some steps being made by the uh - Burger Court to modify the so-called Miranda decision.	1
ClaimBuster	12013	One bank in uh - Washington, fo- for instance, gives lower interest loans for people who adequately insulate their homes or who buy efficient automobiles.	1
ClaimBuster	12014	Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses.	1
ClaimBuster	12015	That's why the National Federation of Independent Businesses said your plan will kill 700,000 jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	12016	So I stand with them.	0
ClaimBuster	12017	Mr. President, I'm still speaking.	0
ClaimBuster	12018	But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half -- half of all the people who work in small business.	1
ClaimBuster	12019	But the point is sometimes the action-	0
ClaimBuster	12020	The shift in emphasis has been very disturbing to me, speaking about the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	12021	It's something I've worked on for 15 years.	1
ClaimBuster	12022	With that kind of limitation, on federal spending, we can fully justify the tax reductions that I have proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	12023	That's the kind of leadership we'll continue to show.	0
ClaimBuster	12024	That's in America's national interest and that will be the case so long as I'm president.	1
ClaimBuster	12025	Stop this business about asking gosh, how old are you?	0
ClaimBuster	12026	A free Iraq will help secure Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	12027	Soldiers who are overseas fighting for us right now.	0
ClaimBuster	12028	I would certainly uh - not cut out atomic power altogether.	0
ClaimBuster	12029	I believe there needs to be instant disclosure on the Internet as to who has given to who.	0
ClaimBuster	12030	I believe Palestinians ought to have a state, but I know they need leadership that's committed to a democracy and freedom, leadership that would be willing to reject terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	12031	Clearly nobody's going to think the president started out thinking he was going to trade arms for hostages.	0
ClaimBuster	12032	I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again...	0
ClaimBuster	12033	Think of your dreams as a child and ask yourself, isn't it time to stop talking about it?	0
ClaimBuster	12034	We're going to get them out; we're going to secure the border.	0
ClaimBuster	12035	It seems to me that our tax structure today has rates that are too high.	0
ClaimBuster	12036	It's not being taken away from anybody else, except we'll downsize the Department of Education.	0
ClaimBuster	12037	We will make some gains in the United States Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	12038	And he went out and he did it.	1
ClaimBuster	12039	Charter schools aren't the only answer, but they're providing competition.	0
ClaimBuster	12040	We need decisions made on sound principles.	0
ClaimBuster	12041	Let's not let them fool with it anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	12042	Our allies know, -- they're not certain what we're going to do, what our reaction, what our response is going to be.	0
ClaimBuster	12043	Well, again, the president just said, categorically, my opponent is against this, my opponent is against that.	1
ClaimBuster	12044	That is not the way you deal with the Soviets.	0
ClaimBuster	12045	... in order to give -- in order to give additional tax cuts to Joe the plumber before he was at the point where he could make $250,000.	0
ClaimBuster	12046	But one of the things we've learned is, is that when we take that approach, whether it's in North Korea or in Iran, then we have a better chance at better outcomes.	0
ClaimBuster	12047	Then companies won't come here.	0
ClaimBuster	12048	If the Vice President of the United States thinks that Robert Bork was an outstanding appointment (Cheers and Applause)	0
ClaimBuster	12049	I think it's not just an economic issue, I think it's a moral issue.	0
ClaimBuster	12050	We're spending a third more on all of the -- well, all of the programs of human service.	1
ClaimBuster	12051	Look, the genius of America is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work on an idea, make their own decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	12052	We'll never succeed in Iraq if the Iraqi citizens do not want to take matters into their own hands to protect themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	12053	I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.	1
ClaimBuster	12054	For one thing, let me just follow up here.	0
ClaimBuster	12055	So it seems to me that we ought to take that money we can save from the Department of Education, put it into opportunity scholarships and tell little Landale Shakespeare out in Cleveland, Ohio, and tell your mother and father, you're going to get to go to school because we're going to match what the state puts up, and you're going to go to the school of your choice.	0
ClaimBuster	12056	Thank you for your question.	0
ClaimBuster	12057	And it will have, I think, an important effect on the price of a barrel of oil.	0
ClaimBuster	12058	It's completely out of control.	0
ClaimBuster	12059	But nothing is more important than us no longer borrowing $700 billion or more from China and sending it to Saudi Arabia.	1
ClaimBuster	12060	The wages of Americans have gone down.	1
ClaimBuster	12061	That was a command decision made by the commanders on the spot and based with what they thought was best for the men there.	1
ClaimBuster	12062	Particularly where it's someone where you've had business dealings.	0
ClaimBuster	12063	We submitted the biggest drug budget ever.	1
ClaimBuster	12064	Chinese Communists have been moving ahead the last ten years.	0
ClaimBuster	12065	You're going to have to watch it.	0
ClaimBuster	12066	Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.	0
ClaimBuster	12067	I'm the last one, right?	0
ClaimBuster	12068	"We're telling other people, ""You can't have nuclear weapons,"" but we're pursuing a new nuclear weapon that we might even contemplate using."	1
ClaimBuster	12069	"Say, ""Look, here's what we can do."	0
ClaimBuster	12070	Von Fremd, the first thing we have to do is to continue to keep confidence abroad in the American dollar.	0
ClaimBuster	12071	Why do we start things that we know the Soviets will match and make us all less secure?	0
ClaimBuster	12072	He said that a fish rots from the head down as he was going after Ed Meese.	1
ClaimBuster	12073	Every time you do that you take a risk.	0
ClaimBuster	12074	It was a promise for less government and less taxes and more freedom for the people.	0
ClaimBuster	12075	But I'm also a serious guy.	0
ClaimBuster	12076	I'm not so sure that it means steadily higher fuel costs, but I do believe that this nation has been portrayed for too long a time to the people as being energy-poor when it is energy-rich.	0
ClaimBuster	12077	You were promised a middle-class tax cut in 1992.	1
ClaimBuster	12078	The fact is that in too many parts of our country, we still have discrimination.	0
ClaimBuster	12079	So we've got to innovate through school choice.	0
ClaimBuster	12080	We haven't heard from the governor any specifics beyond Big Bird and eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood in terms of how he pays for that.	1
ClaimBuster	12081	It wasn't created as a welfare program.	1
ClaimBuster	12082	Just to uh - correct the record, Mr. Nixon said on depletion that his record was the opposite of mine.	1
ClaimBuster	12083	It was an energy bill on the floor of the Senate loaded down with goodies, billions for the oil companies, and it was sponsored by Bush and Cheney.	1
ClaimBuster	12084	They cover 98% of their people and their insurance premiums are much cheaper than the rest of America, and so does Rochester, New York.	1
ClaimBuster	12085	I appreciate the jobs in coal and oil and gas.	0
ClaimBuster	12086	I would never tolerate it as president of the United States, and I will hope that Senator Kennedy will change his mind if he should be elected.	0
ClaimBuster	12087	And, absolutely, I wanted a cessation of the violence, because it put an enormous strain on Georgia, and that's why I was the first to say that we have to rebuild the Georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild.	1
ClaimBuster	12088	And in addition to that, we need programs, particularly in higher education, which will stimulate scientific breakthroughs which will bring more growth.	0
ClaimBuster	12089	The Wall Street Journal said your numbers don't add up.	1
ClaimBuster	12090	Let's talk about military spending, and that's this.	0
ClaimBuster	12091	I've campaigned on this since the primaries.	1
ClaimBuster	12092	What I've said is that we have to store it safely.	1
ClaimBuster	12093	What do we do then?	0
ClaimBuster	12094	This bill imposes upon employers the responsibility of determining whether somebody who applies for a job is an American or not.	1
ClaimBuster	12095	I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people.	0
ClaimBuster	12096	"When I say ""phony spirit,"" I mean phony, not because the spirit is not good on our side, but because the Soviet Union simply doesn't intend to carry out what they say."	0
ClaimBuster	12097	I've got a bracelet, too, from Sergeant - from the mother of Sergeant Ryan David Jopeck (ph), given to me in green bay.	1
ClaimBuster	12098	And I was able to do so with a lot of Democrat votes, nearly 50% of the Hispanic vote, about 27% of the African-American vote, because people know I'm a conservative person and a compassionate person.	1
ClaimBuster	12099	But when he's asked, how are you going to do it, which deductions, which loopholes are you going to close?	0
ClaimBuster	12100	The Senate Budget Committee --	0
ClaimBuster	12101	But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	12102	And I just think that we ought to do everything we can to respect the American family.	0
ClaimBuster	12103	Including Senators previously who had supported it on the Republican side.	0
ClaimBuster	12104	And where it's been done, those schools, like in Rochester, those schools that weren't chosen find that they then compete and do better.	1
ClaimBuster	12105	We have to stop the spending, which has mortgaged your children's futures.	0
ClaimBuster	12106	You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product.	0
ClaimBuster	12107	I think that we could not afford not to do these things.	0
ClaimBuster	12108	In effect, what Senator Kennedy recommends is that the United States government should give help to the exiles and to those within Cuba who oppose the Castro regime - provided they are anti-Batista.	1
ClaimBuster	12109	He is -- listen, they went through a horrible situation in Beslan, where these terrorists gunned down young school kids.	1
ClaimBuster	12110	But even in this area, where I think new legislation would be justified, uh the Congress has not responded.	0
ClaimBuster	12111	And the answer is, no, I will not have a litmus test.	0
ClaimBuster	12112	You can't do it with the school bureaucracy controlling everything and that's why we have a new program that I hope people have heard about.	0
ClaimBuster	12113	What would you do if you were the Israelis and the president of a country says that they are -- they are determined to wipe you off the map, calls your country a stinking corpse?	0
ClaimBuster	12114	No, I don't, because I think that America has to stand with democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	12115	One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones -- we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out.	0
ClaimBuster	12116	Well, Aleppo is a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	12117	You were very clear that you would not provide, government assistance to the U.S. auto companies, even if they went through bankruptcy.	1
ClaimBuster	12118	Now finally, with regard to the whole problem of combating recession, as you call it, we must use the full resources of the government in these respects: one, we must see to it that credit is expanded as we go into any recessionary period - and understand, I do not believe we're going into a recession.	0
ClaimBuster	12119	And the Taliban is no longer in power, and Al Qaida no longer has a place to plan.	1
ClaimBuster	12120	I just can't do it.	0
ClaimBuster	12121	Well, you know, as I travel around the country, this is one of the single most frequently asked issues that I get, is the issue of health care.	0
ClaimBuster	12122	And these folks are just dividing up 199 billion bucks and the children get lost.	1
ClaimBuster	12123	He added the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation, and it came, at that time, to 12.5% under President Ford.	1
ClaimBuster	12124	It's ruining us in trade.	0
ClaimBuster	12125	And I have long ago said I supported the president on this other matter.	1
ClaimBuster	12126	And he talked about how optimistic he was and the country was about heading toward elections.	1
ClaimBuster	12127	Let me come back in one moment to that, but I want to speak for a second, if I can, to what the president said about fiscal responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	12128	The final point that I would like to make is this: Senator Kennedy has suggested in his speeches that we lack compassion for the poor, for the old, and for others that are unfortunate.	1
ClaimBuster	12129	During the last five years, Texas's government has gone up in size.	1
ClaimBuster	12130	Sometimes he has to act.	0
ClaimBuster	12131	We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on those who actually killed us on 9/11.	1
ClaimBuster	12132	I believe that it's accurate to say that - that the - that the committees to whom you refer with the - the employment that you uh - state, and with the 5 to 5 and a half percent growth rate in our economy, that the uh - projections would be a uh - a $60 billion increase in the amount of money that we'd have to spend in l981 compared to now.	1
ClaimBuster	12133	That's why I'm proud and grateful to be a citizen of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	12134	Iran now and Russia are now against us.	1
ClaimBuster	12135	If we could've stopped Rwanda, surely, if we had the ability, that would be something that we would have to strongly consider and act.	0
ClaimBuster	12136	What the American people can't afford, though, is four more years of failed economic policies.	0
ClaimBuster	12137	And we had an initiative that we were working on to raise women's pay.	1
ClaimBuster	12138	We have to restore trust.	0
ClaimBuster	12139	So I rolled the dice, I put my career on the line because I really believe the future of America is on the line.	0
ClaimBuster	12140	I think a targeted tax cut is better for our future, targeted to education and child rearing, with the rest of the education plan, hooking up all of our classrooms to the Internet by the year 2000.	0
ClaimBuster	12141	It was a superb occasion.	0
ClaimBuster	12142	One of our first officers was a woman, the chief financial officer.	1
ClaimBuster	12143	The bills that I vetoed, the one for an additional $6 billion, was not a bill that would have solved our unemployment problems.	1
ClaimBuster	12144	Asia will be our largest trading partner in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	12145	We have an adversarial relationship that's destroying jobs and sending them overseas while we have the finest workers in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	12146	It's not good to raise the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	12147	And just in that respect, I say it's rigged, because she should never...	0
ClaimBuster	12148	If you're married, we reduced the marriage penalty.	1
ClaimBuster	12149	We cannot pay off the $4 trillion debt, balance the budget and have the industries of the future and the high- paying jobs in this country without having the revenue.	1
ClaimBuster	12150	I believe we can set our priorities.	0
ClaimBuster	12151	Governor Rockefeller says five per cent.	1
ClaimBuster	12152	Your future benefits would be cut by the amount that's diverted into the stock market.	1
ClaimBuster	12153	In fact, he doubled it.	1
ClaimBuster	12154	And believe me, they're not doing it to get me elected.	0
ClaimBuster	12155	Bob, we relied upon a company out of England to provide about half of the flu vaccines for the United States citizen, and it turned out that the vaccine they were producing was contaminated.	1
ClaimBuster	12156	I think that would help.	0
ClaimBuster	12157	"You've got to be able to look in the eyes of families and say to those parents, ""I tried to do everything in my power to prevent the loss of your son and daughter."""	0
ClaimBuster	12158	Our d- security depends upon Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	12159	Did Khrushchev gain because he took his shoe off and pounded the table and shouted and insulted?	0
ClaimBuster	12160	I heard more of the same.	0
ClaimBuster	12161	They have to include the other countries of Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	12162	And not about personal things.	0
ClaimBuster	12163	That would be an abrogation of our agreement with NATO.	1
ClaimBuster	12164	I want to take that $716 billion you've cut and put it back into Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	12165	We are a force of good in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	12166	When you came to office 32 million people on food stamps.	1
ClaimBuster	12167	We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines.	1
ClaimBuster	12168	Well, first, Jim, let me thank you and thank you, Senator Dole, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen, all of you listening tonight for the chance you've given us to appear.	0
ClaimBuster	12169	The fact happens to be that education spending is up by the federal government; it is up.	1
ClaimBuster	12170	Yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also.	1
ClaimBuster	12171	The unemployment, the number of people who are still looking for work, is still 23 million Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	12172	This is wrong, and we have to do something about it.	0
ClaimBuster	12173	No U.S. soldier ever dies in vain because they're carrying out the missions of their commander in chief.	0
ClaimBuster	12174	It was a remarkable event.	1
ClaimBuster	12175	And the best America is not behind us.	0
ClaimBuster	12176	We did propose a regulation six months after I became President under the law he mentioned.	1
ClaimBuster	12177	It would be likely that they would uphold Roe v. Wade.	0
ClaimBuster	12178	I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	12179	Oh, there were occasional snipings and sometimes some artillery fire, but we did not engage in conflict that was out of line with our mission.	0
ClaimBuster	12180	And that will be as bad as NAFTA.	0
ClaimBuster	12181	That I can tell you.	0
ClaimBuster	12182	There's too many issues left unresolved.	0
ClaimBuster	12183	Our thoughts and prayers go out to the lion of the Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	12184	This is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	12185	I will find the best people in the world -- in the United States of America who have a history of strict adherence to the Constitution.	0
ClaimBuster	12186	There were other issues associated with this -- with this tragedy.	0
ClaimBuster	12187	Look, the problem is that under Governor Bush's plan, $1.6 trillion tax cut, mostly to the wealthy, under his own budget numbers, he proposes spending more money for a tax cut just for the wealthiest 1% than all the new money he budgets for education, health care and national defense combined.	1
ClaimBuster	12188	Now, I'm a plain-speaking man and I learned long ago that your word was your bond.	0
ClaimBuster	12189	Number three, women can't be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act.	1
ClaimBuster	12190	My opponent said this is a bitterly divided time.	1
ClaimBuster	12191	"I remember the vice president saying, ""Just give us a chance to get up there, we're going to make sure you get tax cuts."""	1
ClaimBuster	12192	But in the last 24 hours there has been some subsiding of the violence there.	1
ClaimBuster	12193	The difficulty, of course, is that we do have heavy obligations abroad, that we therefore have to maintain not only a favorable balance of trade but also send a good deal of our dollars overseas to pay our troops, maintain our bases, and sustain other economies.	0
ClaimBuster	12194	I think we have been right in carrying it.	0
ClaimBuster	12195	We need more work on value-added processing.	0
ClaimBuster	12196	That's 16 million jobs in America.	1
ClaimBuster	12197	But it was also military.	1
ClaimBuster	12198	I first proposed a long time ago that we would have to examine every agency and every bureaucracy of government.	1
ClaimBuster	12199	Well, of course, where has the private sector been, Governor Reagan, during the years that our cities have been deteriorating?	0
ClaimBuster	12200	You are going to drive business out.	0
ClaimBuster	12201	You can't do that as president.	0
ClaimBuster	12202	I thought the best example of a way to handle the situation was East Timor when we provided logistical support to the Australians, support that only we can provide.	0
ClaimBuster	12203	"When you give us access, we'll give you access."""	0
ClaimBuster	12204	You've bought a front row box seat and you're not happy with your health care and you're saying tonight we've got bad health care but very expensive health care.	0
ClaimBuster	12205	He's the one that brought up, to garner primary votes, the whole question of the ACLU.	0
ClaimBuster	12206	And he was a risk that -- and this is where we just have a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	12207	And Jerry Falwell says that means we get two or three judges.	1
ClaimBuster	12208	I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	12209	And we have weakened our position in NATO because the other countries in Europe supported the democ- democratic forces in Portugal long before we did; we stuck to the Portugal dictatorships much longer than other democracies did in this world.	1
ClaimBuster	12210	The situation today cries out for bipartisanship.	0
ClaimBuster	12211	Well, if you watched my television show the other night, you saw it.	0
ClaimBuster	12212	And that's the kind of judge I'm going to put on there.	0
ClaimBuster	12213	Four, we're going to say if you receive federal money, measure third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grade.	0
ClaimBuster	12214	It's going to be a test of our nerve and will.	0
ClaimBuster	12215	They wonder how an elected representative uh - can serve them and participate in such activities uh - serving in the Congress of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	12216	Jim, if I could just respond.	0
ClaimBuster	12217	And if there are any federal employees in this group, you know what that means.	0
ClaimBuster	12218	In terms of in response to the question, no.	0
ClaimBuster	12219	And I believe you're right on to something, that if we don't change the education we're not going to be able to compete.	0
ClaimBuster	12220	I have a plan to put people back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	12221	Part of that, as the Gallup Polls show, is because the Soviet Union made a breakthrough in outer space.	1
ClaimBuster	12222	I understand what the president is talking about, because I know what it means to lose people in combat.	0
ClaimBuster	12223	Tipper and I have been married for 30 years.	1
ClaimBuster	12224	That's the kind of defense program that uh - Mr. Carter wants.	1
ClaimBuster	12225	But, you know, I think my ideas are better for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	12226	Whether you borrow the money or whether you simply tax it away from the people, you're taking the same amount of money out of the private sector, unless and until you bring down government's share of what it is taking.	0
ClaimBuster	12227	I think we ought to be lifting them up and moving our children forward.	0
ClaimBuster	12228	You know, my friends, my parents came to this country as immigrants like millions and millions of Americans before them and since, seeking opportunities, seeking the American dream.	1
ClaimBuster	12229	There are no more than a handful of American military personnel in Haiti now.	1
ClaimBuster	12230	We don't have time for on-the-job training, my friends.	0
ClaimBuster	12231	He promised -- he -- you know -- let me just say --	1
ClaimBuster	12232	That was more than a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	12233	Quite often Congress has passed laws in the past designed to help people with uh - the ownership of homes and with the control of crime and with adequate health care and education programs and so forth.	1
ClaimBuster	12234	Therefore that treaty does not commit the United States to defend anything except Formosa and the Pescadores, and to deal with acts against that treaty area.	1
ClaimBuster	12235	Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere.	0
ClaimBuster	12236	I've worked on this issue.	1
ClaimBuster	12237	And all you have to do is look at the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	12238	I don't look on it personally as relevant, and I consider it really a waste of time tonight, when you consider the issues that face our country right now.	0
ClaimBuster	12239	And the president has chosen a policy that makes it impossible for our scientists to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	12240	Nobody's been talking about that, and Senator McCain knows it.	0
ClaimBuster	12241	The federal government puts about 6% of the money up.	1
ClaimBuster	12242	Step one, we want to put America back to work, clean up the small business problem, have one task force at work on that.	0
ClaimBuster	12243	Therefore, you don't know what's it like.	0
ClaimBuster	12244	They sent me a picture of her in the classroom.	1
ClaimBuster	12245	That's what the question in this campaign is about.	0
ClaimBuster	12246	President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters.	1
ClaimBuster	12247	I did not say that.	1
ClaimBuster	12248	Well I think we should st- strengthen our conventional forces, and we should attempt in January, February, and March of next year to increase the airlift capacity of our conventional forces.	0
ClaimBuster	12249	And we need law and order.	0
ClaimBuster	12250	And when I am re-elected, I believe one of the first things ought to be to press a new Congress not beholden to the old ways to pass financial reform legislation that modernizes the banking system, doesn't put a lot of inhibitions on it, and protects the depositors through keeping the FDIC sound.	0
ClaimBuster	12251	I'll close on this point.	0
ClaimBuster	12252	How about Sandra Day O'Connor as an example?	0
ClaimBuster	12253	It's against my political interest to say go ahead and go along with the tax increase, but I did what I thought was right at the time.	1
ClaimBuster	12254	We don't have inflation because the people are living too well.	0
ClaimBuster	12255	We have made good progress, and there is no doubt in my mind that the commitment to unemployment compensation, the minimum wage, welfare, national health insurance, those kinds of commitments that have typified the Democratic party since ancient history in this country's political life are a very important element of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	12256	First of all, to channel research and development funds into areas that will provide uh large numbers of jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	12257	Everybody goes to Delaware, because they've got very -- pretty loose laws when it comes to things like credit cards.	1
ClaimBuster	12258	And community colleges are on the job.	1
ClaimBuster	12259	Now if we continue with these policies, this trillion and a half dollars worth of new debt that's already been added on the backs of the American taxpayer is going to increase even more, and if we continue with this for another four years, then I'm worried about the next generation, whether we can ever turn this situation around.	1
ClaimBuster	12260	In my view that's going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past.	0
ClaimBuster	12261	I've said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said.	0
ClaimBuster	12262	We have much to do to step up that war, to double the number of drug enforcement agents, to fight both here and abroad, to work with our neighbors in this hemisphere.	0
ClaimBuster	12263	A governor gets to name supreme court judges.	1
ClaimBuster	12264	That's -- that's important, of course.	0
ClaimBuster	12265	And I have supported the largest pay raise in many a year, and I support another one now.	1
ClaimBuster	12266	And I think that's that's the thrust we will make.	0
ClaimBuster	12267	Ninety-eight percent of America, I'm giving you a tax cut and I'm giving you health care.	1
ClaimBuster	12268	One of the reasons I regret it is that getting a detail wrong interfered several times with the point that I was trying to make.	0
ClaimBuster	12269	That's not the role of a president to decide right and wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	12270	And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right?	0
ClaimBuster	12271	The reason I did so was because I was worried that activist judges are actually defining the definition of marriage, and the surest way to protect marriage between a man and woman is to amend the Constitution.	0
ClaimBuster	12272	We could have saved more lives if we had acted earlier.	0
ClaimBuster	12273	What I can promise you is that I will make the playing field as fair as possible, that I will, for instance, make certain that with respect to the tax system that you as a worker in America are not subsidizing the loss of your job.	0
ClaimBuster	12274	So I think our record of cutting back employees, plus the failure on the part of the Governor's programs to actually save employment in Georgia, shows which is the better plan.	0
ClaimBuster	12275	Right now, the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year.	1
ClaimBuster	12276	We stand for those values and we have to be willing to assert them.	0
ClaimBuster	12277	The reason incomes are down is because unemployment is so high.	1
ClaimBuster	12278	Hey, if she had a problem -- for 30 years she's been doing this, Anderson.	1
ClaimBuster	12279	King Abdullah of Jordan said just yesterday or the day before you can't hold elections in Iraq with the chaos that's going on today.	1
ClaimBuster	12280	Now, we also have people sicker because they don't have health insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	12281	I've stated on many occasions that the United States must meet its commitment on Berlin.	0
ClaimBuster	12282	Through the years I have sat in the National Security Council.	1
ClaimBuster	12283	And by the way, you skipped Israel, our closest friend in the region, but you went to the other nations.	1
ClaimBuster	12284	I agree our military is the strongest in the world today, that's not the question.	1
ClaimBuster	12285	The interest rates are based on inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	12286	I'm trying to save your Medicare, just as I rescued Social Security with a bipartisan commission.	1
ClaimBuster	12287	I think that there are situations like in Bosnia or Kosovo where there's a genocide, where our national security is at stake there.	0
ClaimBuster	12288	We've got a backdoor draft taking place in America today: people with stop-loss programs where they're told you can't get out of the military; nine out of our 10 active duty divisions committed to Iraq one way or the other, either going, coming or preparing.	1
ClaimBuster	12289	And so I think when you look at those results, you know the plan I've laid out for the future has a very good chance of being enacted if you'll give me a chance to build that bridge to the 21st Century.	0
ClaimBuster	12290	This current administration's worked hard to keep the parties at the table.	0
ClaimBuster	12291	I would meet with the leaders of the Congress, with all the newly elected members of the Congress and as many others with whom I could meet between the time of the election and the inauguration, and we would present a jobs program.	0
ClaimBuster	12292	All that I can say is this: what we need here are not just high hopes.	0
ClaimBuster	12293	No, and I have to (Applause)	0
ClaimBuster	12294	I'd rather be able to have an insurance company.	0
ClaimBuster	12295	And we've been through a lot together during the last 3 3/4 years.	1
ClaimBuster	12296	I met that woman again.	1
ClaimBuster	12297	If he wants to start, he can start.	0
ClaimBuster	12298	I didn't think he necessarily made the right decision to take land troops off the table right before we committed ourselves offensively, but nevertheless, it worked.	1
ClaimBuster	12299	However, I honor the right of people who seek the constitutional amendments on school busing, on uh - prayer in the schools and an abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	12300	But I am asking for your help and assistance to be president for the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	12301	Now in determining how we deal with this issue, we must find the answer to a very important but simple question: who threatens the peace?	0
ClaimBuster	12302	Mr. May, I recently saw a Princeton University study that indicated that the cities of America - the large cities of this country - are in worse shape today than they were in 1960.	1
ClaimBuster	12303	And we're in real trouble on that.	0
ClaimBuster	12304	I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over.	0
ClaimBuster	12305	So let's be clear about my tax plan and Senator McCain's, because we're not going to be able to deal with entitlements unless we understand the revenues coming in.	0
ClaimBuster	12306	I think that, you know, I would hope to be able to convince people I could handle the Iraqi situation better.	0
ClaimBuster	12307	So I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	12308	And if Israel is attacked, we have their back, not just diplomatically, not just culturally, but militarily.	0
ClaimBuster	12309	I just thought when I came into office it was time that there was some realistic talk to and about the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	12310	Who do you want to start with?	0
ClaimBuster	12311	17 new taxes, spend 1.5 trillion dollars, 50 new bureaucracies.	1
ClaimBuster	12312	Last year under Mr. Ford, of all the Food for Peace that went to South America, 85 percent went to the military dictatorship in Chile.	1
ClaimBuster	12313	I think it's -- before I came in, my wife and daughter and I had a prayer.	1
ClaimBuster	12314	And thank you to the people of Hartford, our hosts.	0
ClaimBuster	12315	Betty and I have worked very hard to give our children a brighter future in the United States, our beloved country.	0
ClaimBuster	12316	Our Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case.	1
ClaimBuster	12317	Yours is phased in in eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	12318	Now, let me tell you what I favor instead.	0
ClaimBuster	12319	Thirty years ago, there were three policemen for every crime.	1
ClaimBuster	12320	This puts us on a road to Greece.	0
ClaimBuster	12321	Get a variety of choices to make in their lives.	0
ClaimBuster	12322	Now, I just believe that what we have to do is enforce the civil rights laws.	0
ClaimBuster	12323	I promised, when we took office, that we would reduce inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	12324	When I met her in the backyard at Joe and Jan O'Neill's in Midland, Texas, it was the classic backyard barbecue.	1
ClaimBuster	12325	And that's where the President's failure to master, in my opinion, the essential elements of arms control has cost us dearly.	0
ClaimBuster	12326	And I think that most of our people -- this is why we had a 25-percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up.	1
ClaimBuster	12327	Well, there are a range of things that are probably going to have to be delayed.	0
ClaimBuster	12328	Got rid of a despot who had killed Americans and as a consequence, despite this tragedy, you had tens of thousands of Libyans after the events in Benghazi marching and saying America is our friend.	1
ClaimBuster	12329	We wanted to have the right of self-determination in southern Africa.	0
ClaimBuster	12330	We're going as fast as the experts say we should.	1
ClaimBuster	12331	That's why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don't let terrorists buy weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	12332	It's three times bigger than what President Clinton proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	12333	What I want you to understand is the national debt is not the only cause of that.	0
ClaimBuster	12334	The record shows that I'm right.	1
ClaimBuster	12335	I would eliminate the tariff on imported sugarcane-based ethanol from Brazil.	0
ClaimBuster	12336	And some people in high positions of leadership, tell us that the answer is to retreat.	0
ClaimBuster	12337	The current system today has meant a lot for a lot of seniors, and I really appreciate the intentions of the current system as I mentioned.	0
ClaimBuster	12338	They're seeing their premiums, their co-pays go up.	1
ClaimBuster	12339	So don't tell me about words.	0
ClaimBuster	12340	Well, I'm saying that Senator Dole said in his fine speech in San Diego that he wanted to build a bridge to the past.	1
ClaimBuster	12341	First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists.	1
ClaimBuster	12342	I have seen Cuba go to the Communists.	1
ClaimBuster	12343	But now we find that the countries of Europe for example, that we have aided, and Japan, that we've aided in the Far East; these countries - some our former enemies, have now recovered completely.	1
ClaimBuster	12344	So these are the differences.	0
ClaimBuster	12345	But, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as they're advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	12346	And I will continue working with him over the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	12347	Entertainment industry, people involved in the schools, education.	0
ClaimBuster	12348	And the Russians need to understand that.	0
ClaimBuster	12349	Secondly, we need to have a commitment in the uh private sector uh - to cooperate with government in matters like housing.	0
ClaimBuster	12350	And the Perot voters that are looking for a home ought to take a look at the Republican record.	0
ClaimBuster	12351	And as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan.	1
ClaimBuster	12352	The Soviet Union is no more, and now we're working to help them become totally democratic through the Freedom Support Act that I led on, a great Democratic ambassador, Bob Strauss, over there, Jim Baker, all of us got this thing passed -- through cooperation, Ross -- it worked with cooperation, and you're for that, I'm sure, helping Russia become democratic.	1
ClaimBuster	12353	And she ended up living alone by choice.	1
ClaimBuster	12354	But the last thing we ought to do is make those who wear the uniforms sacrifice.	0
ClaimBuster	12355	We just recently ended those drive-by deliveries saying people can't be kicked out of the hospital by insurance companies when they've just had babies.	1
ClaimBuster	12356	That's where two- thirds of the new jobs are going to come from.	0
ClaimBuster	12357	It works particularly when we pay our troops well.	0
ClaimBuster	12358	And that leads me to some different conclusions from Senator Dole.	0
ClaimBuster	12359	The average cost of a health care insurance plan in America today is $5,800.	1
ClaimBuster	12360	I have a tremendous income.	1
ClaimBuster	12361	But what's been happening over the last couple of years is, as we've watched this tumult in the Middle East, this rising tide of chaos occur, you see Al Qaida rushing in, you see other jihadist groups rushing in.	1
ClaimBuster	12362	The 9/11 Commission put out a report that said America is safer but not yet safe.	1
ClaimBuster	12363	First and foremost we have to fully fund LIHEAP which is a way to help low income folks, particularly here in the east to pay for high fuel bills.	0
ClaimBuster	12364	I think we disagree on the implication of his remarks tonight and on the statements that he has made on many occasions during his campaign to the effect that the United States has been standing still.	0
ClaimBuster	12365	The means are at question.	0
ClaimBuster	12366	In terms of programs, I've submitted, what, 4 different budgets to the US Congress in great detail.	1
ClaimBuster	12367	But you have to have some basic ability.	0
ClaimBuster	12368	One press conference he had without sound.	1
ClaimBuster	12369	I said I wasn't perfect.	0
ClaimBuster	12370	Over the next four years, we'll continue to work to make sure health care is available and affordable.	0
ClaimBuster	12371	His experience didn't prevent him from participating or involving or in some way being involved in the relationship between this government and Mr. Noriega and drug trafficking in Panama.	0
ClaimBuster	12372	You've got to be clear, both to our allies and our enemies, about where you stand and what you mean.	0
ClaimBuster	12373	The Soviet Union relationship with Syria is at a very low point.	1
ClaimBuster	12374	The economic growth is less than half today what it was at the beginning of this year.	1
ClaimBuster	12375	I believe Governor Romney is a good man.	0
ClaimBuster	12376	Nothing Governor Romney just said is true, starting with this notion of me apologizing.	1
ClaimBuster	12377	We proposed and passed a healthy forest bill which was essential to working with -- particularly in Western states -- to make sure that our forests were protected.	1
ClaimBuster	12378	I want to invest in hard-working families.	0
ClaimBuster	12379	That has been their priority.	0
ClaimBuster	12380	Or, alternatively, it's got to be paid for, not only by closing deductions for wealthy individuals, that -- that will pay for about 4 percent reduction in tax rates.	0
ClaimBuster	12381	We gave them ample time.	0
ClaimBuster	12382	And now this economy is growing.	1
ClaimBuster	12383	Who threatens freedom in the world?	0
ClaimBuster	12384	General Colin Powell said the same thing, he fears the initiative would take away the extra effort programs.	1
ClaimBuster	12385	We ought to make them disclose the people they've given money to when they're testifying before congressional committees; we ought to close the lawyers' loopholes; they ought to have to disclose when they're really lobbying.	0
ClaimBuster	12386	It's also going to make sure that you're not paying as much for gas.	0
ClaimBuster	12387	I am running for President as an Independent because I believe our country is in trouble.	1
ClaimBuster	12388	I could do that very quickly.	0
ClaimBuster	12389	I'm very proud to be the Republican nominee reaching out to Democrats and Independents.	0
ClaimBuster	12390	Right now, what happens is those employees get dumped into either the Medicaid system, which taxpayers pick up, or they're going to the emergency room for uncompensated care, which everybody picks up in their premiums.	1
ClaimBuster	12391	But if and when you do it, Jim, you have to do it in a way that passes the test, that passes the global test where your countrymen, your people understand fully why you're doing what you're doing and you can prove to the world that you did it for legitimate reasons.	0
ClaimBuster	12392	Number three, Castro is only the beginning of our difficulties throughout Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	12393	I'll bring them home with victory and with honor and that is a fundamental difference.	0
ClaimBuster	12394	If we are going to have the initiative in the world, we must remember that the people of Africa and Asia and Latin America don't want to be pawns simply in a struggle between two great powers - the Soviet Union and the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	12395	And you voted to cut services to 23 million school children under the safe and drug-free schools act.	1
ClaimBuster	12396	But what the American people understand is that I look at what we need to get done to keep the American people safe and to move our interests forward, and I make those decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	12397	We created 23 million new jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	12398	Just as I fought for our country as a young man, with the same passion I will fight to defend this nation that I love.	1
ClaimBuster	12399	And in that situation, what happens is, is that the protections you have, the consumer protections that you need, you're not going to have available to you.	0
ClaimBuster	12400	But we have a very different view about how to make America stronger and safer.	0
ClaimBuster	12401	And -- and that is part of what's at stake in this election.	0
ClaimBuster	12402	--because the people, not the special interests, put me there.	0
ClaimBuster	12403	Children across our country don't have health care.	1
ClaimBuster	12404	There's a big difference between the two of us.	0
ClaimBuster	12405	This is the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	12406	And I think that's a good thing.	0
ClaimBuster	12407	This morning, I got a call from the skipper of the Mayaguez.	1
ClaimBuster	12408	He now wants to take the six-party talks we have -- China, North Korea, South Korea, Russia, Japan and the United States -- and undermine them by having bilateral talks.	0
ClaimBuster	12409	I believe in our parks.	0
ClaimBuster	12410	Actually, I made my intentions -- made my views clear.	0
ClaimBuster	12411	So what I want to do is I want to call upon Republicans and Democrats to forget all the arguing and finger pointing, and come together and take care of our seniors' prescription drug program, that says we'll pay for the poor seniors, we'll help all seniors with prescription drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	12412	And if there is any inequities in oil or any other commodity, then I would vote to close that loophole, I have voted in the past to reduce the depletion allowance for the largest producers; for those from five million dollars down, to maintain it at twenty-seven and a half per cent.	1
ClaimBuster	12413	Let me make one other point.	0
ClaimBuster	12414	I think of those people that took us back into space again, Rick Houk and that crew, as people that are worthy of this.	1
ClaimBuster	12415	You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity.	0
ClaimBuster	12416	And so let's do it for most all, but not completely eliminate it for the very top.	0
ClaimBuster	12417	I would hope I never have to.	0
ClaimBuster	12418	And now we see beheadings.	1
ClaimBuster	12419	We simply cannot have people sitting one behind the wheel of a car in these long traffic jams going in and out of our great cities.	0
ClaimBuster	12420	They avoided even the advice of their own general.	1
ClaimBuster	12421	I think the American people will be called upon to uh - uh - be in the forefront in giving leadership to the solution of those problems that must be solved in the Middle East, in southern Africa, and any problems that might arise in the Pacific.	0
ClaimBuster	12422	Their ideas is to raise taxes and spend more money.	0
ClaimBuster	12423	Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.	0
ClaimBuster	12424	The trends before we -- before I got my current job were on the decline, the number of divisions were reduced.	1
ClaimBuster	12425	And I'm going to offer it to America.	0
ClaimBuster	12426	You've had your chance, Vice President, you've been there for eight years and nothing has been done.	1
ClaimBuster	12427	But by speaking clearly and sending messages that we mean what we say, we've affected the world in a positive way.	0
ClaimBuster	12428	They exiled some, they jailed some, they murdered some.	1
ClaimBuster	12429	And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.	0
ClaimBuster	12430	We had a substantial increase in new permits for housing.	1
ClaimBuster	12431	We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on Afghanistan, and we did deliver a surge of troops.	1
ClaimBuster	12432	He's just not credible when he talks about being fiscally conservative.	0
ClaimBuster	12433	Also, we had a - a 2 percent increase in the number of employees the last year.	1
ClaimBuster	12434	And a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that.	0
ClaimBuster	12435	We can store and we can reprocess.	0
ClaimBuster	12436	Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately, on four different occasions, he has advocated making Social Security a voluntary system, which would, in effect, very quickly bankrupt it.	1
ClaimBuster	12437	And what you're seeing on all this Iraq-gate is a bunch of people who were wrong on the war trying to cover their necks here and try to do a little revisionism.	0
ClaimBuster	12438	Well, I wasn't the one having trouble explaining it.	1
ClaimBuster	12439	Now, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let's use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do.	0
ClaimBuster	12440	But look what's happened to the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	12441	Those are the kind of specifics that I think we have to discuss on these uh - debates, and these are the kind of programs that I'll talk about on my time.	0
ClaimBuster	12442	And the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program.	1
ClaimBuster	12443	The biggest disaster that could happen is that we not succeed in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	12444	Not one of them selected a Communist government.	1
ClaimBuster	12445	I want to see asymmetrical reductions in conventional forces.	0
ClaimBuster	12446	First of all, we have a big plan to reduce the capital gains tax when people sell their homes.	0
ClaimBuster	12447	We're going to go forward with the Stealth and the D-5 and the advance cruise missile and good conventional forces.	0
ClaimBuster	12448	And it reminds me that it is vital for us not to confuse the war, ever, with the warriors.	0
ClaimBuster	12449	I love the fact that people will listen to a guy with a bad accent and a poor presentation manner talking about flip charts for 30 minutes, because they want the details.	0
ClaimBuster	12450	Plus, we need fiscal discipline.	0
ClaimBuster	12451	So this is going to be an important issue.	0
ClaimBuster	12452	We've got to show moral support for Ukraine.	0
ClaimBuster	12453	If, for example, somebody confesses to the crime and somebody is waiting on death row, there has to be alertness to say wait a minute, have we got the wrong guy?	0
ClaimBuster	12454	What I've done is set priorities and funded them.	1
ClaimBuster	12455	I have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harm's way.	1
ClaimBuster	12456	When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows?	1
ClaimBuster	12457	When you cut back on defense spending, some people are going to be thrown out of work.	0
ClaimBuster	12458	If we're going to combat unemployment, then, we have to do a better job in these areas.	0
ClaimBuster	12459	What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	12460	It's not the length of your resume.	0
ClaimBuster	12461	And so you've got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that.	0
ClaimBuster	12462	These are people that I just happen to know and have a high regard for.	1
ClaimBuster	12463	So I care a lot about this, and I've spent countless hours in schools.	1
ClaimBuster	12464	I have not had the experience the President has had in holding that office, but I think in being Governor of California, the most populous state in the Union - if it were a nation, it would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world - I, too, had some lonely moments and decisions to make.	1
ClaimBuster	12465	We're just in a period -- we've got to work to bring it -- my opponent keeps mentioning John McCain, and I'm glad he did.	1
ClaimBuster	12466	My Secretary of Defense is going to have to make a very difficult decision in which system to go forward with.	0
ClaimBuster	12467	And I believe if we have the option, which scientists tell us we do, of curing Parkinson's, curing diabetes, curing, you know, some kind of a, you know, paraplegic or quadriplegic or, you know, a spinal cord injury, anything, that's the nature of the human spirit.	0
ClaimBuster	12468	But I merely say that the treaty is quite precise and I sustain the treaty.	0
ClaimBuster	12469	A president can't be all things to all people.	0
ClaimBuster	12470	Now, I think the Russians ought to understand that we will support -- we, the United States -- will support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in the natural process, inclusion into NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	12471	Now, it may very well be here in December you'll hear me say, I think there's a safe way to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	12472	Those gray-area weapons systems are creating some problems in a - the agreement for a SALT II negotiation.	1
ClaimBuster	12473	The United States is still the indispensable nation in the aftermath of the Cold War and on the brink of the 21st Century.	0
ClaimBuster	12474	We can help build coalitions but we can't put our troops all around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	12475	Well, I'm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	12476	Let me ask a simple question.	0
ClaimBuster	12477	Senator McCain is absolutely right that the violence has been reduced as a consequence of the extraordinary sacrifice of our troops and our military families.	0
ClaimBuster	12478	As a matter of fact, the tools now given to the terrorist fighters are the same tools that we've been using against drug dealers and white-collar criminals.	1
ClaimBuster	12479	I don't think that's right.	0
ClaimBuster	12480	He went after a federal judge, born in Indiana, but who Donald said couldn't be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican.	1
ClaimBuster	12481	And I think that this is so important.	0
ClaimBuster	12482	You look at the violence that's taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C.	0
ClaimBuster	12483	Well, can I answer that?	0
ClaimBuster	12484	I will pay down the national debt.	0
ClaimBuster	12485	I finally got 'em for 12 to 15 years.	1
ClaimBuster	12486	There is a separation there.	0
ClaimBuster	12487	We should do it in phases.	0
ClaimBuster	12488	That's why we've kept on pushing trade deals, but trade deals that make sure that American workers and American businesses are getting a good deal.	0
ClaimBuster	12489	Yes, in unemployment that is likely to create additional pressure on prices, how willing are you to consider an incomes policy, in other words, wage and price controls?	0
ClaimBuster	12490	The government isn't getting a tax now from businesses there because they aren't there, or from individuals who are on welfare rather than working.	1
ClaimBuster	12491	And then I brought folks together to get it done.	1
ClaimBuster	12492	It is the single greatest threat that this country has.	0
ClaimBuster	12493	There were three Democratic presidents who led us into war.	1
ClaimBuster	12494	Millions and millions of Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	12495	Now, that has nothing to do with learning.	0
ClaimBuster	12496	I don't think that's a bad decision.	0
ClaimBuster	12497	The point is you've got to have a president who's prepared to do this and to begin right away and, preferably, a president who was a governor of a state that's had very, very successful experience at doing this.	0
ClaimBuster	12498	And we had sanctioned them.	1
ClaimBuster	12499	I disagree with Mr. Perot that the answer is to raise -- put a 50-cent gas tax on the middle class and raise more taxes on the middle class and the working poor than on the wealthy.	0
ClaimBuster	12500	You know, half of all immigrants -- undocumented immigrants in our country -- actually pay federal income tax.	1
ClaimBuster	12501	So there's a -- this is a society that -- of ours that's got to do a better job of teaching children right from wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	12502	Number 2, I think you have to take on specifically the insurance companies and require them to make some significant change in the way they rate people in the big community pools.	0
ClaimBuster	12503	So when you say that I wanted to take the auto industry bankrupt, you actually did.	0
ClaimBuster	12504	Nobody did any of this with evil intent.	0
ClaimBuster	12505	I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college.	0
ClaimBuster	12506	That's how they do things.	0
ClaimBuster	12507	The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	12508	So, if it's time for action, I think I have experience that counts.	0
ClaimBuster	12509	It's hundreds of millions of ads.	1
ClaimBuster	12510	It just reminds me of, you know, he says that he's going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan.	1
ClaimBuster	12511	The problem is they'll be in china.	0
ClaimBuster	12512	We haven't seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.	0
ClaimBuster	12513	So I believe that we need to reward these good teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	12514	He talked about the unemployed.	1
ClaimBuster	12515	And so I favor, strongly favor, term limits.	0
ClaimBuster	12516	But there is no corner on this sleaze factor, believe me.	0
ClaimBuster	12517	Will it be a nightmare world threatened with the proliferation of atomic bombs, not just in five major countries but dozens of smaller countries that have been permitted to develop atomic weapons because of a failure of our top leadership to stop proliferation?	1
ClaimBuster	12518	Now I would not provide a litmus test.	0
ClaimBuster	12519	But we also have to have a short-term fix, in my view, and long- term fixes.	0
ClaimBuster	12520	Our industrial competitors, who are beating us in competition, spend less and have better health care.	1
ClaimBuster	12521	The fact of the matter is that employers who today are insuring their employees are paying the freight, because they're paying for those who aren't.	0
ClaimBuster	12522	I want flexibility, and I do you know, these people laugh about the thousand points of light.	0
ClaimBuster	12523	Now I've seen a good many hundreds of thousands of people who are uh - not adequately fed.	0
ClaimBuster	12524	Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering; he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him.	1
ClaimBuster	12525	And it was one of the largest declines in our history.	1
ClaimBuster	12526	Take a look at Aleppo.	0
ClaimBuster	12527	That's money in your pocket.	0
ClaimBuster	12528	I would take any action necessary to defend the treaty, Formosa, and the Pescadores Island.	0
ClaimBuster	12529	It's a good idea, they saw it, they picked it up and put it in theirs, but it's only temporary.	0
ClaimBuster	12530	Well a lot of it came from the Bakken Range in North Dakota.	1
ClaimBuster	12531	Admiral Yarnell, the commander of the Asiatic fleet, has said that these islands are not worth the bones of a single American.	1
ClaimBuster	12532	You know, over the last 20 months, you've invited me into your homes.	0
ClaimBuster	12533	And in this case we can't enhance the penalty any more than putting those three thugs to death.	0
ClaimBuster	12534	It's a great thing for companies to expand.	0
ClaimBuster	12535	If we had taken your advice Governor Romney about our auto industry, we'd be buying cars from China instead of selling cars to China.	0
ClaimBuster	12536	So what should we do?	0
ClaimBuster	12537	And I had the will of the people in my state behind me.	1
ClaimBuster	12538	We went through this tragic experience leading to World War II.	0
ClaimBuster	12539	That's big government at its best.	0
ClaimBuster	12540	We don't do anything to cut down on peak load requirements.	0
ClaimBuster	12541	I will veto anything that takes money out of Social Security for privatization or anything else other than Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	12542	We're using our steel capacity fifty-five per cent today.	1
ClaimBuster	12543	That's the kind of leadership we've shown in the region.	1
ClaimBuster	12544	Now if you uh - take the medium or middle-income taxpayer - that's about $14 thousand per person - uh - Governor Carter has indicated, publicly, in an interview that he would increase the taxes on about 50 percent of the working people of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	12545	Mr. Stone, I've had to make thousands of decisions since I've been President, serving in the Oval Office.	0
ClaimBuster	12546	Because I think that the special interests have too much power, and we need to give our democracy back to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	12547	I don't anticipate that in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	12548	And that's been the tragic story of the arms race.	0
ClaimBuster	12549	That's what Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole did, not me.	1
ClaimBuster	12550	In the past, we have not had an adequate military presence in that region.	0
ClaimBuster	12551	Our government is smaller and less bureaucratic and has given more authority to the states than its two predecessors under Republican presidents.	1
ClaimBuster	12552	Thank you, Jim; thank you, Mr. President; thank everyone for watching and listening.	0
ClaimBuster	12553	And once the border is secured, at a later date, we'll make a determination as to the rest.	0
ClaimBuster	12554	And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	12555	I mean, I'm not I don't like to get into personal matters.	0
ClaimBuster	12556	All of those are legally deductions, deductible in computing your tax, and it was a 1-year thing with him.	1
ClaimBuster	12557	And it is to that great task, if we're successful, that we will address ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	12558	And I never promoted Fannie Mae.	1
ClaimBuster	12559	He's got to raise 20,000 bucks a week to have enough money to run.	1
ClaimBuster	12560	We have ideas in the Dole-Kemp campaign and we will rescue Medicare as we did Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	12561	And I'll keep my word on the economic package.	0
ClaimBuster	12562	I think if you talk to anybody, it's not choice.	0
ClaimBuster	12563	I mean, who does that?	0
ClaimBuster	12564	That conceivably could have prevented that tragedy.	0
ClaimBuster	12565	We shouldn't do that.Ã¢â€°Â¤ That's the kind of Vice President I want.	0
ClaimBuster	12566	But we got to have a knowledge base.	0
ClaimBuster	12567	Well, this is another fundamental difference that I have with the vice president, just as I do in the case of health care for 37 million members of working families in this country who don't have health insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	12568	She failed to get the birth certificate.	1
ClaimBuster	12569	We are going to be thriving again.	0
ClaimBuster	12570	It means help for homeowners so that they can stay in their homes.	0
ClaimBuster	12571	He has put pressure on the Congress - and I don't believe Mr. Ford would even deny this - to hold up on nonproliferation legislation until the Congress agreed for an $8 billion program for private industry to start producing enriched uranium.	1
ClaimBuster	12572	So, it does play a part in my life.	0
ClaimBuster	12573	That's why it's essential we hold the line.	0
ClaimBuster	12574	And as you know, the education cost has gone up uh - tremendously.	1
ClaimBuster	12575	But as far as underground tests for developing peaceful uses of atomic energy, we should not allow this Soviet filibuster to continue.	0
ClaimBuster	12576	Jane, there are a lot of ways to be competitive.	0
ClaimBuster	12577	Thank you, and God bless you.	0
ClaimBuster	12578	In the meantime, bin Laden is still out there.	1
ClaimBuster	12579	And this is happening on a weekly basis.	1
ClaimBuster	12580	"There's easy money out there."""	0
ClaimBuster	12581	I think that would destroy the integrity and the strength of NATO, and I am totally opposed to it.	0
ClaimBuster	12582	It is the strongest, best prepared, best equipped it has ever been.	0
ClaimBuster	12583	And then as far as other areas are concerned, I think that we have to look to presidential leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	12584	But people know where I stand.	0
ClaimBuster	12585	Not only that, but it robs this country of jobs, because instead of coming back with that million dollars and creating a shoe factory, say in New Hampshire or Vermont, if the company takes the money down to Italy and - and builds a shoe factory, they don't have to pay any taxes on the money.	0
ClaimBuster	12586	"And I said, ""I will -- I will wear his bracelet with honor."""	1
ClaimBuster	12587	And the shipment of Spruance-class destroyers to Iran are much more highly sophisticated than the Spruance-class destroyers that are present being delivered to our own Navy.	1
ClaimBuster	12588	In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st.	1
ClaimBuster	12589	In the last four years, there have been twice as many bankruptcies as new jobs created.	1
ClaimBuster	12590	There's a pipeline that runs from the Caspian through Georgia through Turkey.	1
ClaimBuster	12591	I'll never give a veto to any country over our security.	0
ClaimBuster	12592	I want to thank the League of Women Voters and the city of Louisville for hosting this evening's debate.	0
ClaimBuster	12593	I remember talking by the telephone.	1
ClaimBuster	12594	It means in my plan hiring bonuses to get 100,000 new teachers in the public schools within the next four years.	1
ClaimBuster	12595	I have, obviously, supported those efforts that the United States had to go in militarily and I have opposed that I didn't think so.	1
ClaimBuster	12596	He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine...	1
ClaimBuster	12597	You're cutting into the fiber and muscle of our conventional forces.	0
ClaimBuster	12598	If you want to hear it, you get it tomorrow night -- you'll hear it tomorrow night.	0
ClaimBuster	12599	That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan.	0
ClaimBuster	12600	We then organized the strongest coalition and the strongest sanctions against Iran in history, and it is crippling their economy.	1
ClaimBuster	12601	Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience.	0
ClaimBuster	12602	I have never advocated a Communist government for Italy.	1
ClaimBuster	12603	But when the tables get turned, I ought to do my share.	0
ClaimBuster	12604	And I've never seen such a pounding, an unfair pounding, on a young Senator in my entire life.	0
ClaimBuster	12605	That's not the way I would have done it.	0
ClaimBuster	12606	That was my first vote against tobacco companies when I said we ought to label cigarettes.	1
ClaimBuster	12607	They assumed that the uh - inflation rate was because of excessive demand and uh - therefore put into effect tight constraint on the economy, very high interest rates, which is typical also of the Republican administration, uh - tried to increase the uh - the tax uh - payments by individuals, and cut the tax payments by corporations.	1
ClaimBuster	12608	And then to let people save in an IRA and withdraw from it without a tax penalty for education, home buying or medical expenses, that's the right way to go into the 21st Century, balance the budget and cut taxes, not balloon with this $550 billion tax scheme.	0
ClaimBuster	12609	Now, many of the programs that I'm talking about - economic growth, care for the aged, development of our natural resources - build the strength of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	12610	It's going to blow a hole in the deficit It's going to raise taxes on nine million people and require bigger cuts than the one I vetoed.	0
ClaimBuster	12611	And if a few more people had gone to the polls and voted in 1968, Hubert Humphrey would have been President; Richard Nixon would not.	0
ClaimBuster	12612	Now, the most important thing we can do is to make sure that we are creating jobs in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	12613	Our foreign competitors are doing it; we're not.	1
ClaimBuster	12614	Because as we're here tonight in this debate, we are seeing, for the first time in a long time, Republicans and Democrats together, sitting down, trying to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that we're in.	1
ClaimBuster	12615	We have Iran four years closer to a nuclear bomb.	0
ClaimBuster	12616	Devastating what's happening to our inner cities.	0
ClaimBuster	12617	Every chairman of the Finance and Ways and Means Committee, Republican leaders in the Senate and the House are telling you that.	0
ClaimBuster	12618	We've got to advocate for their membership in NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	12619	Secondly, I'd take on diplomatic isolation efforts.	0
ClaimBuster	12620	I believe in self-reliance and individual initiative and risk takers being rewarded.	0
ClaimBuster	12621	And I think it's very commendable the work she's done on behalf of special needs.	0
ClaimBuster	12622	Last year, I wrote to the secretary of the Treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it.	1
ClaimBuster	12623	I was taught -- I went to a church school and I was taught that the two greatest commandments are: Love the Lord, your God, with all your mind, your body and your soul, and love your neighbor as yourself.	1
ClaimBuster	12624	Well, whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor, since you've asked it.	0
ClaimBuster	12625	Since I suggested this format I hope it's been good for all of you.	0
ClaimBuster	12626	The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies.	0
ClaimBuster	12627	We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels.	0
ClaimBuster	12628	The first president in 72 years to lose jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	12629	Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	12630	There is a tax loophole right now.	1
ClaimBuster	12631	I will release my tax returns.	0
ClaimBuster	12632	Now that was quite an admission.	0
ClaimBuster	12633	And then you can sit down and say, help me do what we should for the cities.	0
ClaimBuster	12634	"I think there's an optimism in the land and a patriotism, and I think that we're in a position once again to heed the words of Thomas Paine, who said: ""We have it in our power to begin the world over again.''"	0
ClaimBuster	12635	And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today.	0
ClaimBuster	12636	It seemed to me that if I was to uh adequately and effectively handle the problems of high inflation, a growing recession, the uh - involvement of the United States still in Vietnam that I had to give a hundred percent of my time to those two major problems.	0
ClaimBuster	12637	And we were warned 5 days before that explosives were on their way, and they weren't taken.	1
ClaimBuster	12638	Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians.	0
ClaimBuster	12639	The question again is not one of goals - we're for those goals - it's one of means.	0
ClaimBuster	12640	Would he have started a war?	0
ClaimBuster	12641	But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange.	1
ClaimBuster	12642	I'm going to make the state do this and make the state do that.	0
ClaimBuster	12643	And the proof of that is 23 million people out of work.	1
ClaimBuster	12644	He was going to break it up because he would - knew that he wasn't going to get his way on Berlin and on the other key matters with which he was concerned at the Paris Conference.	0
ClaimBuster	12645	By having a limited government and a focused government, we can send some of the money back to the people who pay the bills.	0
ClaimBuster	12646	If there are other specific areas, but beyond that I haven't gotten into any of these things, as the President knows.	0
ClaimBuster	12647	It's also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations.	0
ClaimBuster	12648	And I don't think anybody has a call on people in their Administrations going astray.	0
ClaimBuster	12649	Some of our troops are not well-equipped.	1
ClaimBuster	12650	"How could you be Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces and have some kid say -- when you have to make a tough decision, as I did in Panama or Kuwait and then have some kid jump up and say, ""Well, I'm not going to go."	0
ClaimBuster	12651	I'm going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal.	0
ClaimBuster	12652	And I lower the cost of health care in the way that I described to you.	1
ClaimBuster	12653	And -- and attacking me is not an agenda.	0
ClaimBuster	12654	Now, look, I'm just kind of a, you know, cur dog here; I was put on the ballot by the people, not special interests.	1
ClaimBuster	12655	He didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Mr. President.	1
ClaimBuster	12656	So we're not putting restraints on American exploration, we're encouraging it in every way we can.	0
ClaimBuster	12657	He says mistakes were made.	0
ClaimBuster	12658	We have peace with freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	12659	In Libya we stood on the side of the people.	1
ClaimBuster	12660	Now, Senator Obama, I'd like -- still like to know what that fine is going to be, and I don't think that Joe right now wants to pay a fine when he is seeing such difficult times in America's economy.	0
ClaimBuster	12661	He came and asked for a tax cut -- we wanted a tax cut to kick the economy into gear.	1
ClaimBuster	12662	My attitude is, if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it.	0
ClaimBuster	12663	Mr. and Mrs. America, when you hear him say we're going to tax only the rich, watch your wallet because his figures don't add up and he's going to sock it right to the middle class taxpayer and lower, if he's going to pay for all the spending programs he proposes.	1
ClaimBuster	12664	My school choice program, GI Bill for Kids, does not take public money and give it to private schools.	1
ClaimBuster	12665	And I'll stop, Tom, and you didn't even wave.	1
ClaimBuster	12666	You know, Congress passed a law called DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act.	1
ClaimBuster	12667	I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.	1
ClaimBuster	12668	I know that for many of you sitting at home, parents of kids in Iraq, you want to know who's the person who could be a commander in chief who could get your kids home and get the job done and win the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	12669	We can work with them, we can collaborate with them, if they're willing to be responsible.	0
ClaimBuster	12670	Because it's so essential to our economic strength and to our future.	0
ClaimBuster	12671	Just yesterday, I was in Toledo shaking some hands in a line.	1
ClaimBuster	12672	When you say loud and clear to somebody if you're going to carry a gun illegally, we're going to arrest you.	0
ClaimBuster	12673	This package has transparency in it.	0
ClaimBuster	12674	I can talk reasonably about life and about responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	12675	And I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	12676	You've now heard three debates, months of campaigning and way too many TV commercials.	0
ClaimBuster	12677	I ask for your support, I ask for your help.	0
ClaimBuster	12678	So the Ford administration has done a good job in helping our good ally, Israel, and we're dedicated to the survival and security of Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	12679	We have no energy policy.	1
ClaimBuster	12680	Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places.	1
ClaimBuster	12681	But in doing this, we have made sure that we address this question peacefully, not injecting American military forces into combat, but letting the strength of our nation be felt in a beneficial way.	0
ClaimBuster	12682	Candy, there's no doubt that world demand's gone up, but our production is going up, and we're using oil more efficiently.	1
ClaimBuster	12683	And I guarantee you I would not publicly state that I'm going to attack them.	0
ClaimBuster	12684	And if we stay firm and strong, we will be able to bring Cuba around as well.	0
ClaimBuster	12685	That's what I've done in Texas and that's the kind of leadership style I'll bring to Washington.	1
ClaimBuster	12686	Here's your fine -- zero.	0
ClaimBuster	12687	And if we can do that and do it in a way that gets deeper cuts on the Soviet side, which is where they ought to come from, then I think we have an opportunity over the long haul to begin to move some of our resources from the military to important domestic priorities that can provide college opportunity for that young woman whose mother wrote me from Texas just the other day, from Longview, Texas: two teachers, a mother and a father who have a child that's a freshman in college, an electrical engineering major, a very bright student and they can't afford to keep that child in college.	1
ClaimBuster	12688	We've done so in my own state.	0
ClaimBuster	12689	But I can say this: The number one responsibility of any president, above all else, is to guarantee the security of our nation - an ability to be free of the threat of attack, or blackmail and to carry out our obligations to our allies and friends, and to carry out a legitimate foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	12690	Now, everyone in the world knows that there were no weapons of mass destruction.	1
ClaimBuster	12691	It doesn't -- under the Medicare plan -- it doesn't help seniors get any better.	0
ClaimBuster	12692	Secondly, I do believe the lawsuits -- I don't believe, I know -- that the lawsuits are causing health-care costs to rise in America.	0
ClaimBuster	12693	But I'll tell you what he's going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	12694	It seems to me that the Miranda case was a case that really made it very, very difficult for the - uh police, the law enforcement people in this country to uh - do what they could to make certain that the victim of a crime was protected and that those that commit crimes uh - were properly handled and uh - sent to jail.	0
ClaimBuster	12695	This is the highest honor that I have ever had in my life, to think that somebody from Russell, Kansas, somebody who grew up living in a basement apartment, someone whose parents didn't finish high school, somebody who spent about 39 months in hospitals after World War II, someone who uses a buttonhook every day to get dressed.	1
ClaimBuster	12696	It's one of the reasons why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in the country.	1
ClaimBuster	12697	I think our troops ought to be used to fight and win war.	0
ClaimBuster	12698	Republicans and Democrats came together and said what can we do to make our public education the best in the country?	0
ClaimBuster	12699	So one of the difficulties with Iraq is that it has put an enormous strain, first of all, on our troops, obviously, and they have performed heroically and honorably and we owe them an extraordinary debt of gratitude.	0
ClaimBuster	12700	We created 23 million new jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	12701	That's what's happening in Iraq, and it wasn't a tactic.	0
ClaimBuster	12702	I'd like the government to have that.	0
ClaimBuster	12703	I'm going to get the training of Iraqis done faster.	0
ClaimBuster	12704	I believe that if we are inspired, if we can achieve a degree of unity, if we can set our goals high enough and work toward recognized goals with industry and labor and agriculture along with government at all levels, then we can achieve great things.	0
ClaimBuster	12705	"Those tapes are in the jurisdiction of the courts and I have no right to say ""yes"" or ""no."""	0
ClaimBuster	12706	They knew how to ask the American people for the right things.	0
ClaimBuster	12707	That's why I've asked you not only to examine my record, but my proposals for the future of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	12708	Well, we'll talk about the tax cut for middle class here in a minute.	0
ClaimBuster	12709	That's what works in other countries and that's what'll work here.	0
ClaimBuster	12710	Tonight I had a chance to discuss with you what to do to keep this economy going: keep the taxes low, don't increase the scope of the federal government, keep regulations down, legal reform, a health- care policy that does not empower the federal government but empowers individuals, and an energy plan that will help us become less dependent on foreign sources of energy.	0
ClaimBuster	12711	My plan does a better job.	0
ClaimBuster	12712	You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.	1
ClaimBuster	12713	In this cold war we have to recognize where it is being fought and then we have to develop programs to deal with it.	0
ClaimBuster	12714	It's all too easy for somebody in the majority in the population to say oh, we're just all the same, without an understanding of the different life experience that you've had, that others have had.	0
ClaimBuster	12715	I've proposed a plan that can capture it and contain it and clean it within four years.	0
ClaimBuster	12716	I'm sure that you know that in the resolutions passed by the Congress, that have added about $17 billion in more spending, by the Congress over the budget that I recommended.	1
ClaimBuster	12717	I'd love to be able to say to my grandchildren, four years after my first term, I'd like to say, your grandfather, working with the leaders of the Soviet Union, working with the leaders of Europe, was able to ban chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth.	0
ClaimBuster	12718	And this is not my own -- only my opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	12719	And the way you kill expansions is to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	12720	I don't know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers' money.	1
ClaimBuster	12721	That you can pass on from one generation to the next.	0
ClaimBuster	12722	These are the questions in these areas that the North and South, East and West are entitled to know.	0
ClaimBuster	12723	And after that, a number of women have come forward saying that's exactly what he did to them.	1
ClaimBuster	12724	So I don't want you to read my lips and I sure don't want you to read his.	0
ClaimBuster	12725	It cut funds to clean up toxic waste dumps with 10 million of our kids still living within four miles of a toxic waste dump, by a third.	1
ClaimBuster	12726	And, I might add, with the democratic Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	12727	We drove the Russians out with -- the Afghan freedom fighters drove the Russians out of Afghanistan, and then we made a most serious mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	12728	Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth.	0
ClaimBuster	12729	The second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down.	0
ClaimBuster	12730	We shore up the border.	0
ClaimBuster	12731	And you can go out and buy your own insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	12732	It's a matter of being consistent.	0
ClaimBuster	12733	I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere.	0
ClaimBuster	12734	I was deeply concerned about seniors having to choose between prescription drugs and food.	0
ClaimBuster	12735	That happened to be a recession year.	1
ClaimBuster	12736	No one can say what that course of action will be, but I think the next president of the United States should watch it carefully.	0
ClaimBuster	12737	And we have put significant pressure on them to make sure they're doing that; to recognize the rights of women, which is critical throughout the region.	1
ClaimBuster	12738	We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit.	1
ClaimBuster	12739	They're foreign lobbyists taking leaves.	1
ClaimBuster	12740	I said that I'd end the war in Iraq, and I did.	1
ClaimBuster	12741	I want the individuals to meet their responsibilities.	0
ClaimBuster	12742	I don't think there is a necessity to put our military in Syria at this stage.	0
ClaimBuster	12743	Here in the United States, which developed the Tennessee Valley and which built the Grand Coulee and the other dams in the Northwest United States at the present rate of hydropower production - and that is the hallmark of an industrialized society - the Soviet Union by 1975 will be producing more power than we are.	1
ClaimBuster	12744	And since I first made that proposal 15 months ago, the price of gasoline, which was then $.80, has gone up to about $1.30.	1
ClaimBuster	12745	Those people -- I don't know those people.	0
ClaimBuster	12746	The report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money.	1
ClaimBuster	12747	If you're married, you got tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	12748	We're the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	12749	There's nothing wrong with the theory of it.	0
ClaimBuster	12750	But, again, spending more money isn't always the answer.	0
ClaimBuster	12751	Ah - I'm not uh - sure that I remembered earlier that President Ford had - had expressed uh - his concern about the statement or apologized for it.	0
ClaimBuster	12752	It's got to be a timetable that all parties can agree to, like the Palestinians and Israelis.	0
ClaimBuster	12753	But I think we can take back Mosul, and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa.	0
ClaimBuster	12754	And we're going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country.	0
ClaimBuster	12755	I held off for the applause.	1
ClaimBuster	12756	I want more trade, and I know there are some good things in that agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	12757	It is true that our exports to Mexico, for example, have gone up and our trade deficit has gone down; it's also true that just today a record high trade deficit was announced with Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	12758	In the meantime, we've got challenges, for example, with China, where we are borrowing billions of dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	12759	Thank you very much tonight, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	12760	We've increased Pell Grants by a million students.	1
ClaimBuster	12761	These kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security, the well being and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age.	0
ClaimBuster	12762	And all I can tell you is every day I know that there's people working overtime, doing the very best they can.	0
ClaimBuster	12763	We had an 18 percent increase in housing starts.	1
ClaimBuster	12764	When you're attacked for your military record, I immediately said it was inappropriate, it had no place in this campaign, and I rejected it.	1
ClaimBuster	12765	At the same time, we have to make certain that the Soviet Union's Backfire, which they claim is not an intercontinental aircraft and which some of our people contend is, must also be included if we are to get the kind of agreement which is in the best interest of both countries.	0
ClaimBuster	12766	We've got to make sure that we're giving them the energy that they need or helping them to create the energy that they need.	0
ClaimBuster	12767	I don't want to see the Federal Government saying to communities, well, you can't do this any more.	0
ClaimBuster	12768	Obama draws the line in the sand.	0
ClaimBuster	12769	But you can't tell me that when the most troops any other country has on the ground is Great Britain, with 8,300, and below that the four others are below 4,000, and below that, there isn't anybody out of the hundreds, that we have a genuine coalition to get this job done.	1
ClaimBuster	12770	Let me say, first of all, Senator Dole has gone back and forth about whether he'd be for repealing the Brady Bill or repealing the assault weapons ban.	1
ClaimBuster	12771	We Republicans came to power to change government, and government changed us.	0
ClaimBuster	12772	But that there would be an answer in our lifetime is unimaginable.	0
ClaimBuster	12773	I think we should try to raise the fuel efficiency.	0
ClaimBuster	12774	Exports are down, and every time an export number goes down, it hurts the farmer.	1
ClaimBuster	12775	Uh - He sent a mission - the President - in 1955 of Mr. uh - Robertson and Admiral Radford.	1
ClaimBuster	12776	So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely.	0
ClaimBuster	12777	I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	12778	Now in that connection Senator Kennedy has criticized the President on the ground not only of not expressing regrets, but because he allowed this flight to take place while the summit conference - or immediately before the summit conference occurred.	1
ClaimBuster	12779	But they don't work if you go raise taxes and then the Congress spends it continues to spend that.	0
ClaimBuster	12780	And I suggested that, certainly, it was to their common interest, along with ours, to avoid a conflict and to attempt to save the world and remove the nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	12781	And we have to be able to give parents the same choice, frankly, that Senator Obama and Mrs. Obama had and Cindy and I had to send our kids to the school -- their kids to the school of their choice.	1
ClaimBuster	12782	We've uh - got a chance tonight to talk about, first of all, leadership, the character of our country, and a vision of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	12783	A few days later, Mr. Schlesinger came back and said if we cut the defense budget by three to five billion dollars, we will have to cut military personnel by two hundred and fifty thousand, civilian personnel by a hundred thousand, jobs in America by a hundred thousand.	1
ClaimBuster	12784	It is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical... leaders that the world has ever seen.	0
ClaimBuster	12785	That's the highest we've ever been in our country.	1
ClaimBuster	12786	Under your direction, to a large extent.	0
ClaimBuster	12787	Well, the truth of the matter is, is that that's exactly what we've done.	0
ClaimBuster	12788	Well, the bottom line is we have to stop exporting jobs here.	0
ClaimBuster	12789	Chris, we don't gain anything.	0
ClaimBuster	12790	So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.	0
ClaimBuster	12791	Teachers' salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries.	1
ClaimBuster	12792	He said all poor seniors.	1
ClaimBuster	12793	One of the reasons for that is that people think it's more attractive in some cases to go offshore than to stay here.	0
ClaimBuster	12794	I know enough about your story to admire a lot of the things that you have done as a person.	0
ClaimBuster	12795	But to continue to commit billions to this system makes no sense at all and I think Mr. Bush has been reconsidering his position over the course of the past few weeks.	0
ClaimBuster	12796	I'd like to see those written instructions.	0
ClaimBuster	12797	And my success in the primary season was, I think, notable for a newcomer, from someone who's from outside Washington, who - who never has been a part of the Washington establishment.	0
ClaimBuster	12798	I don't take credit for all the good things that have happened in America, but I take credit for what I've tried to do to work with others to make good things happen.	0
ClaimBuster	12799	Now, here's what that means.	0
ClaimBuster	12800	Well, every time Donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable, like what these women are saying, he immediately goes to denying responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	12801	But if our government itself is doing business with people who we know are engaged in drug profiteering and drug trafficking, if we don't understand that that sends out a very, very bad message to our young people, it's a little difficult for me to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that I talked about and to young people like her all over the country, and say to them we want to help you.	0
ClaimBuster	12802	We have not known what we've wanted and we've been out-traded in almost every instance.	0
ClaimBuster	12803	I do not say that.	0
ClaimBuster	12804	So I don't think they ought to look at us in any way other than what we are.	0
ClaimBuster	12805	I supported them when they did so.	1
ClaimBuster	12806	I don't disagree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	12807	Look, this is a man who has great numbers.	0
ClaimBuster	12808	In Texas I tried to do something innovative.	0
ClaimBuster	12809	And it's not that simple, either.	0
ClaimBuster	12810	What did we get for it?	0
ClaimBuster	12811	I'll be against it after the election.	0
ClaimBuster	12812	But are we doing enough in these areas?	0
ClaimBuster	12813	So what I've said is we need to fix a broken immigration system and I've done everything that I can on my own and sought cooperation from Congress to make sure that we fix the system.	1
ClaimBuster	12814	And peace comes to the country, and prosperity.	0
ClaimBuster	12815	And I think Americans will judge very seriously as to whether that's the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	12816	I remember when Alf Landon was against Social Security and uh - later President Nixon, sixteen years ago, was telling the public that John Kennedy's proposals would bankrupt the country and would double the cost.	1
ClaimBuster	12817	And that's the kind of America I want to build.	0
ClaimBuster	12818	... advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia.	1
ClaimBuster	12819	Uh - Mr. Maynard, uh - the record of gun control, whether it's one city or another or in some states, does not show that the registration of a gun, handgun, or the registration of the gun owner, has in any way whatsoever decreased the crime rate or the use of that gun in the committing of a crime.	1
ClaimBuster	12820	Now, you know, watch this -- listen very carefully to this.	0
ClaimBuster	12821	"So when you hear ""tax the rich,"" Mr. and Mrs. America, watch your wallet."	0
ClaimBuster	12822	My answer is that this campaign isn't over yet.	0
ClaimBuster	12823	... talking about it this evening.	0
ClaimBuster	12824	But when it comes to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere.	1
ClaimBuster	12825	What I think is most important is that we recognize that to solve the key problems that we're facing, if we're going to solve two wars, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, if we can -- if we're going to focus on lifting wages that have declined over the last eight years and create jobs here in America, then Democrats, independents and Republicans, we're going to have to be able to work together.	0
ClaimBuster	12826	It has not worked the way that it has been promised.	1
ClaimBuster	12827	But the fact is, we're going to help Americans be able to buy into it.	0
ClaimBuster	12828	The net result is we are going to have some improvement in our receipts.	0
ClaimBuster	12829	And I'll just make you one promise, my word is good.	0
ClaimBuster	12830	We're going to have conventional forces that are well maintained, well equipped, well trained, well supported.	0
ClaimBuster	12831	we'd be in a stronger place today.	0
ClaimBuster	12832	I could give better examples, but for - for whatever it is, whether it's in the field of housing, or health, or medical care, or schools, or the eh- development of electric power, we have programs which we believe will move America, move her forward and build on the wonderful record that we have made over these past seven and a half years.	0
ClaimBuster	12833	I would strengthen the Development Loan Fund.	0
ClaimBuster	12834	Obviously small business people want to give their employees health insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	12835	If we don't build more B-2 bombers in California and we lost about 500,000 jobs out in California, because of this devastation, these big, big cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	12836	The policies of the last four years have seen incomes in America decline every year for middle income families, now down $4,300 during your term.	1
ClaimBuster	12837	And if they should be in error slightly on the down side, then I'll phase in the programs that we've uh - advocated, more slowly.	0
ClaimBuster	12838	But it's like his plan to defeat ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	12839	My plan to get the industry on its feet when it was in real trouble was not to start writing checks.	0
ClaimBuster	12840	Let me very briefly give you some examples.	0
ClaimBuster	12841	The fact is that the State Department polls on our prestige and influence around the world have shown such a sharp drop that up till now the State Department has been unwilling to release them.	1
ClaimBuster	12842	If we move into a recession in sixty-one, then I would agree that we have to put more money into the economy, and it can be done by either one of the two methods discussed.	0
ClaimBuster	12843	I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain.	0
ClaimBuster	12844	Let me say -- I certainly hope so.	0
ClaimBuster	12845	Number two, Mr. President, the reason I call it an apology tour is because you went to the Middle East and you flew to Egypt and to Saudi Arabia and to Turkey and Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	12846	So we have a big difference on this trickle down theory.	0
ClaimBuster	12847	The Japanese, the British, the French do it.	1
ClaimBuster	12848	You see that, their small car division leaving.	1
ClaimBuster	12849	Yes, we're getting the job done.	1
ClaimBuster	12850	What I'm referring to there is the mutual self-defense provisions that exist in the Inter-American treaty, the so-called Rio Pact, that permits the nations, our friends in that region, to combine to take steps -- diplomatic and otherwise -- to prevent Nicaragua, when she acts irresponsibly in asserting power in other parts outside of her border, to take those steps, whatever they might be, to stop it.	1
ClaimBuster	12851	Now, that's another thing for you to think about when you go home tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	12852	And let's set the record straight right now by looking at the record, as Al Smith used to say.	0
ClaimBuster	12853	And that's just the way it is.	0
ClaimBuster	12854	His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald.	0
ClaimBuster	12855	I think one of the lessons in between World War I and World War II is we let our military atrophy.	0
ClaimBuster	12856	I think pure research and development investment on the part of the United States government is certainly appropriate.	0
ClaimBuster	12857	Beyond that, as far as the gold supply is concerned, and as far as the movement of gold is concerned, uh - we have to bear in mind that we must get more help from our allies abroad in this great venture in which all free men are involved of winning the battle for freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	12858	I have favored our programs abroad for economic assistance and for military assistance.	1
ClaimBuster	12859	If you create Noriega, using taxpayer money, step up to the plate and say it was a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	12860	Governor Reagan's proposal, the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal, is one of the most highly inflationary ideas that ever has been presented to the American public.	0
ClaimBuster	12861	Textiles, shoes, things like that that we say are yesterday's industries.	0
ClaimBuster	12862	We have achieved extraordinary prosperity.	0
ClaimBuster	12863	But to the issue of Iran, as long as I'm president of the United States Iran will not get a nuclear weapon.	1
ClaimBuster	12864	Then get off to a flying start in '93 to execute these plans.	0
ClaimBuster	12865	They have been short-changed as we have taken ten million taxpayers off the tax rolls in the last eight years, and as we have uh - added to the minimum tax uh - provision to make all people pay more taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	12866	China, is a huge country, broken into many provinces.	1
ClaimBuster	12867	And all of a sudden the results of having no plan have caught up with America.	0
ClaimBuster	12868	Well, Terry, first of all, we honor your service, and we're grateful for it.	0
ClaimBuster	12869	That's the most important part of this.	0
ClaimBuster	12870	I want anti-ballistic missile systems to protect ourselves and our allies from a rogue nation that may try to hold us hostage or blackmail our allies and friends.	0
ClaimBuster	12871	What about the Dingle-Norwood bill?	0
ClaimBuster	12872	Again, I can't tell you how big a mistake I think that is, to have bilateral talks with North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	12873	And a lot of times there are powerful forces that are against you.	0
ClaimBuster	12874	We will fight the terrorists around the world so we do not have to face them here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	12875	I saw the winds of hatred divide people and keep the people of my state poorer than they would have been, spiritually and economically.	0
ClaimBuster	12876	You know, that's a tough question and there's a lot of qualified Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	12877	I believe, as the president indicated, and said at the time that I supported his -- his action there.	1
ClaimBuster	12878	And I don't mean you, Mr. President, but some people in the -- in our nation feel that Pakistan is being nice to us, and that we should walk away fro mthem.	0
ClaimBuster	12879	That was their response to that sort of action.	0
ClaimBuster	12880	That's wonderful, except we have a record to look at.	0
ClaimBuster	12881	We don't know what the world is going to throw at us down the road.	0
ClaimBuster	12882	And during that period about 3,000 young kids every day started smoking.	1
ClaimBuster	12883	And I'm happy to tell you that we have.	0
ClaimBuster	12884	And why have they lost their industry?	0
ClaimBuster	12885	And I've got two daughters and I want to make sure that they have the same opportunities that anybody's sons have.	1
ClaimBuster	12886	More than 90% of America's children go to public schools.	1
ClaimBuster	12887	"And then 5 days before the troops were killed, they went back to the President, through the Secretary of Defense, and said, ""Please, Mr. President, take those troops out of there because we can't defend them.''"	1
ClaimBuster	12888	I'm against the partial-birth abortion, but you've got to have an exception for the life of the mother and the health of the mother under the strictest test of bodily injury to the mother.	0
ClaimBuster	12889	I think we've had a very healthy discussion.	0
ClaimBuster	12890	I, too, want to extend my prayers and blessings, God's blessings on the families whose lives were overturned yes -- tod -- last night.	0
ClaimBuster	12891	For the last eight years I have had the challenge of running the streamlining program called Reinventing Government.	1
ClaimBuster	12892	People who had the money were benefiting.	0
ClaimBuster	12893	The extremes are hurting the AIDS cause.	0
ClaimBuster	12894	Because freedom took hold in that part of the world, but there's a lot of work left to be done, however.	0
ClaimBuster	12895	In fact, independent studies have looked at our respective plans and have concluded that I provide three times the amount of tax relief to middle-class families than Senator McCain does.	1
ClaimBuster	12896	And, Senator Obama, you didn't repudiate those remarks.	1
ClaimBuster	12897	Well, these special kinds of programs have - have robbed the average taxpayer and have benefited those who are powerful, and who can employ lobbyists, and who can have their CPAs and their lawyers to help them benefit from the roughly uh - eight thousand pages of the tax code.	1
ClaimBuster	12898	That's my big difference with him on the draft.	1
ClaimBuster	12899	Let me give you one example.	0
ClaimBuster	12900	"And I said, ""Well, gosh, can't we -- can't we find some -- some women that are also qualified?"""	0
ClaimBuster	12901	My administration has tripled the amount of money we're spending on homeland security to $30 billion a year.	1
ClaimBuster	12902	They had thirty-five people on the list.	1
ClaimBuster	12903	Well, there were some good pictures, but does it fall into that category?	0
ClaimBuster	12904	This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	12905	And I have a lot of young people work in my office, work in my campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	12906	And one thing that the president said, which I want to make sure that we understand, he said that I said we should take Detroit bankrupt.	1
ClaimBuster	12907	Right now there's a peacekeeping force that has been set up and we have African Union troops in Darfur to stop a genocide that has killed hundreds of thousands of people.	1
ClaimBuster	12908	I've met people who struggled with this for years, people who were in a marriage because they were living a sort of convention, and they struggled with it.	0
ClaimBuster	12909	We have access to facilities in five different areas of that region.	1
ClaimBuster	12910	We've doubled the number of loans from the small business administration, tripled the number of loans to women business people, no one unqualified, everybody had to meet the standards.	1
ClaimBuster	12911	We've got to have a package of reforms and it has got to lead to reform prosperity and peace in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	12912	I don't believe in trying to legislate new tests for the selection of the Federal Judiciary.	0
ClaimBuster	12913	And as a consequence, what we've been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans.	1
ClaimBuster	12914	I went down there and talked to the president of Panama about cleaning up their money laundering, and Mr. Noriega was there, but there was no evidence at that time, and when the evidence was there, we indicted him.	1
ClaimBuster	12915	It ended the principle that the polluters should pay for those toxic waste dumps unless it was very recent.	1
ClaimBuster	12916	The American people would be in charge.	0
ClaimBuster	12917	It has also the benefit of allowing citizens to participate in the process.	0
ClaimBuster	12918	I'd like to answer the question, because I've actually been a governor for 12 years, so I've known a lot of people who have lost their jobs because of jobs moving overseas, and I know a lot of people whose plants have been strengthened by increasing exports.	1
ClaimBuster	12919	You know, if you are a country and you're trying to gain the support of another country, then you want to do everything you can that they would act in a cooperative fashion.	0
ClaimBuster	12920	Like the old carpenter says measure twice, cut once.	0
ClaimBuster	12921	Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years.	1
ClaimBuster	12922	I don't want to hurt their feelings on national TV.	0
ClaimBuster	12923	It's the hardest decision a president makes.	0
ClaimBuster	12924	And that's the kind of America I want.	0
ClaimBuster	12925	"And the last conversation she had with her father was him calling from the twin towers, saying ""Peyton (ph), I love you and I will always watch over you."""	1
ClaimBuster	12926	In fact, women's wages have dropped 2.2 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	12927	We have came out of the recession and we're well on the road to real prosperity in this country again.	0
ClaimBuster	12928	We now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control.	1
ClaimBuster	12929	I've been known to mangle a syl-a-ble or two myself, you know, if you know what I mean.	1
ClaimBuster	12930	Secondly, the surest way to bust this economy is to increase the role and size of the federal budget.	0
ClaimBuster	12931	And finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, I'm not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the -- the revenues going to the government.	0
ClaimBuster	12932	I think the President has done some things to raise the sense of spirit, morale, good feeling in this country, and he's entitled to credit for that.	0
ClaimBuster	12933	The Soviet Union and the Communist-dominated government of Iraq are neighbors of Iran, and Iran is an ally of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	12934	I would not agree to any agreement in which the United States security interest was not fully recognized and supported.	0
ClaimBuster	12935	Just no hedges, no ifs, ands and buts.	0
ClaimBuster	12936	I want to do those two things and get this -- get this to a balanced budget with eight -- eight to 10 years.	0
ClaimBuster	12937	I know that throughout my life this has made a difference to me.	0
ClaimBuster	12938	What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women.	1
ClaimBuster	12939	So Governor Clinton can label it tax for the rich or anything he wants.	0
ClaimBuster	12940	Today it is up a plus 4 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	12941	I served an a hospital authority.	1
ClaimBuster	12942	One of the serious problems, hear me well, is that our system of government is being undermined by too much influence coming from special interest money.	0
ClaimBuster	12943	Everybody ought to be in this thing.	0
ClaimBuster	12944	And we've -- you know, Senator McCain and I have some fundamental disagreements on the economy, starting with Senator McCain's statement earlier that he thought the fundamentals of the economy were sound.	1
ClaimBuster	12945	And I've stood up with these people, and I understand what you have to do to be strong in this situation, and it's moving, not as fast as we'd like.	0
ClaimBuster	12946	And I am convinced we need to do a lot of things.	0
ClaimBuster	12947	Thank you to Lynn University for welcoming us here.	0
ClaimBuster	12948	And what is he going to say to those people that show up at the summit?	0
ClaimBuster	12949	Number three, I'm going to get us to a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	12950	Because they felt that the American society was moving again.	0
ClaimBuster	12951	In fact it makes it less likely for them to come here...	0
ClaimBuster	12952	"The mistake that was made was making the ""read my lips"" promise in the first place just to get elected, knowing what the size of the deficit was."	0
ClaimBuster	12953	I'd like to say to Mr. Bush, even though I've got profound differences with him, I do honor his service to our country.	0
ClaimBuster	12954	You know, I was having lunch with some -- a veteran in Minnesota who had been a medic dealing with the most extreme circumstances.	1
ClaimBuster	12955	They end up being worse than the people.	0
ClaimBuster	12956	I thought the President did the right thing with Mexico and was very strongly supportive of the administration in Mexico.	0
ClaimBuster	12957	One of the reasons I'm such a strong believer in legal reform is so that people aren't afraid of producing a product that is necessary for the health of our citizens and then end up getting sued in a court of law.	0
ClaimBuster	12958	Well I understood that this was the Eisenhower-Nixon Administration according to all the Republican uh - propaganda that I've read.	1
ClaimBuster	12959	We're doing that precisely, and I think one thing sooner or later we're going to have to consider is take a look at the Social Security system.	0
ClaimBuster	12960	Look at the record and make your decision.	0
ClaimBuster	12961	These are reasonable ways to help promote a culture of life in America.	0
ClaimBuster	12962	So, the plan that we have had and that we are following is a plan that is based on growth in the economy, recovery without inflation, and reducing the share that the Government is taking from the gross national product, which has become a drag on the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	12963	We also want to say that insofar as is humanly possible the banking industry itself should pay for the cost of any bank failures; the taxpayers should not.	0
ClaimBuster	12964	Look, I'm very proud of my vice presidential selection, Joe Biden, who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and as he explains, and as John well knows, the issues of Afghanistan, the issues of Iraq, critical issues like that, don't go through my subcommittee because they're done as a committee as a whole.	1
ClaimBuster	12965	If we're going to have follow-ups, then I will want follow-ups, as well.	0
ClaimBuster	12966	But the point is -- the point is, we have finally seen Republicans and Democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package.	1
ClaimBuster	12967	We don't want another Iraq, we don't want another Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	12968	And a majority in every country except Greece, felt that it would be the Soviet Union by l970.	1
ClaimBuster	12969	This would mean the resumption of a very dangerous nuclear arms race.	0
ClaimBuster	12970	"And if I were to ever say, ""This is the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place,"" the troops would wonder, how can I follow this guy?"	0
ClaimBuster	12971	And we certainly need to adjust the certain loan eligibility to inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	12972	I think the people should put America first, rather than party first.	0
ClaimBuster	12973	And the interesting place-one of the things that fascinates me about this perestroika and glasnost is wheats going to happen in Eastern Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	12974	Police officers are being cut from the streets of America because the president decided to cut the COPS program.	1
ClaimBuster	12975	But we do have differences.	0
ClaimBuster	12976	I have voted for alternate fuel all of my time...	1
ClaimBuster	12977	They have 270 billion dollars in Medicare cuts the first education cuts in history, cut environmental enforcement by 25 percent, took away the guarantee of quality standards in nursing homes, took away the guarantee of health care for folks with disabilities.	1
ClaimBuster	12978	It brought the crime rate way down.	1
ClaimBuster	12979	Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.	0
ClaimBuster	12980	Obviously the president and I both have very strong convictions.	0
ClaimBuster	12981	And then I went down to the border towns of Storok (ph), which had experienced missiles raining dowm from Hamas.	1
ClaimBuster	12982	You can't take different positions on these difficult issues.	0
ClaimBuster	12983	I voted for border security, and there are...	1
ClaimBuster	12984	So let's not raise anybody's taxes, my friends, and make it be very clear to you I am not in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy.	0
ClaimBuster	12985	That's what I feel passionately about.	0
ClaimBuster	12986	To me that's what it's all about.	0
ClaimBuster	12987	We have to both bring down the deficit and get our economy going through these kinds of investments in order to get the kind of wealth and jobs and incomes we need in America.	0
ClaimBuster	12988	We are the ones that lowered the barrier to products with Carla Hill's negotiation.	1
ClaimBuster	12989	And only one in 20 students would be eligible for these vouchers, and they wouldn't even pay the full tuition to private school.	1
ClaimBuster	12990	It is absolutely essential in terms of bringing our banking system and credit system into the new age instead of having it living back in the dark ages.	0
ClaimBuster	12991	What about the other 15,000?	0
ClaimBuster	12992	But the military -- let's get back to the military, though.	0
ClaimBuster	12993	We're a freedom-loving nation and if we're an arrogant nation they'll view us that way, but if we're a humble nation they'll respect us.	0
ClaimBuster	12994	I've met parents who've on the Internet gotten the armor to send their kids.	1
ClaimBuster	12995	There have been preliminary skirmishing in the committees of the Senate, but the Treaty has never come to the floor of the Senate for either a debate or a vote.	1
ClaimBuster	12996	But what is also important for us to understand is, is that for America to be successful in this region there's some things that we're going to have to do here at home as well.	0
ClaimBuster	12997	Now you listed some things - the uh - deferral on foreign income as estimated: that would save about $500 million.	1
ClaimBuster	12998	They have done a brilliant job, and General Petraeus has done a brilliant job.	0
ClaimBuster	12999	Also, we'll never be strong again overseas, unless we're strong at home.	0
ClaimBuster	13000	You know what the bad news is that follows on that.	0
ClaimBuster	13001	And we provide a 50 percent tax credit so that they can buy health insurance for their workers, because there are an awful lot of small businesses that I meet across America that want to do right by their workers but they just can't afford it.	1
ClaimBuster	13002	It's easy to say in retrospect I would have done something differently.	0
ClaimBuster	13003	Not what a commander in chief does when you're trying to lead troops.	0
ClaimBuster	13004	In addition, I believe the next president in January and February should go to work in building the strength of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	13005	I don't think we ought to reward illegal behavior.	0
ClaimBuster	13006	Well, Margaret, we've heard it again tonight and I'm not surprised, the labels.	0
ClaimBuster	13007	Another thing that I'd like to say is this: In our international trade, as I said in my op- opening statement, we have become the arms merchant of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	13008	They're not going to follow an American president who says follow me into a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	13009	We're going to defeat ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	13010	But I certainly will support the outcome of this election.	0
ClaimBuster	13011	Well, I've been governor of a small state for 12 years.	1
ClaimBuster	13012	You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina.	0
ClaimBuster	13013	No, it's not time to divorce a nation on Earth that has 100 nuclear weapons and is on the way to double that at some point, a nation that has serious threats from terrorist groups within its nation, as I indicated before, the Taliban, Haqqani Network.	1
ClaimBuster	13014	Your question -- your question is one that's being asked by college kids all over this country.	1
ClaimBuster	13015	Did they occur when you were a young person, in your formative years?	0
ClaimBuster	13016	But we have to prove we can pay for them.	0
ClaimBuster	13017	My plan balances the budget within 6 years.	1
ClaimBuster	13018	The best America doesn't leave some of its citizens behind.	0
ClaimBuster	13019	This, to me, is a very important difference between him and me in this election, and I believe the American people will judge accordingly.	0
ClaimBuster	13020	I think all of us should have a respect for innocent life.	0
ClaimBuster	13021	I just thought of another -- another big difference here between me.	0
ClaimBuster	13022	I think it can be.	0
ClaimBuster	13023	It's time for a new administration to deal with the energy problem.	0
ClaimBuster	13024	And, finally, we have to stand by our principles.	0
ClaimBuster	13025	I think we have to come together and work to change it.	0
ClaimBuster	13026	And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what's happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she's going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she's -- he's just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama.	1
ClaimBuster	13027	Now, one thing I don't understand, Jim, is why is it that the wealthiest 1% get their tax cuts the first year, but 95% of seniors have to wait four to five years before they get a single penny?	1
ClaimBuster	13028	The President held it up.	1
ClaimBuster	13029	But if somebody -- and I'll ask the press -- if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started.	0
ClaimBuster	13030	If the American people cannot be brought together, we can't turn this country around.	0
ClaimBuster	13031	You don't finance long-term debt with short-term money.	0
ClaimBuster	13032	We've got to anticipate some of these problems ahead of time.	0
ClaimBuster	13033	But there are other folks out there.	0
ClaimBuster	13034	Now, I don't want to get into that --	0
ClaimBuster	13035	"And President Bush did some smart things at the outset, but one of the opportunities that was missed was, when he spoke to the American people, he said, ""Go out and shop."""	1
ClaimBuster	13036	He said in his speech he wants to make sure the right people get tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	13037	Didn't close off the borders.	0
ClaimBuster	13038	When this Republican administration came into office we were shipping about $1 billion worth of arms overseas, now ten to twelve billion dollars worth of arms overseas to countries that quite often use these weapons to fight each other.	1
ClaimBuster	13039	I'd like to thank the people of St. Louis and Washington University, the Presidential Debate Commission and all those who made this night possible.	0
ClaimBuster	13040	More money goes to the -- can I have a rebuttal here?	0
ClaimBuster	13041	So this is a national security issue.	0
ClaimBuster	13042	It was very clear this was not a demonstration.	0
ClaimBuster	13043	And if they -- if they find that -- that they can't get the benefits here that they want and they can't -- and they can't find the job they want, then they'll make a decision to go a place where -- where they have better opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	13044	Our commanders have got all the flexibility to do what is necessary to succeed.	1
ClaimBuster	13045	And you know, Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment.	1
ClaimBuster	13046	I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.	0
ClaimBuster	13047	Because there's no way you can finance what you want to spend.	0
ClaimBuster	13048	We also wanted Medicare to be able to negotiate bulk purchasing.	1
ClaimBuster	13049	Under -- under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up.	0
ClaimBuster	13050	It is to fully fund the McKinney Act.	0
ClaimBuster	13051	It has begun to decline, but it is still going up.	1
ClaimBuster	13052	But the White House staff increased its expenditures by considerably more than Congress has in the last 4 years under the Bush administration, and Congress has actually spent a billion dollars less than President Bush asked them to spend.	1
ClaimBuster	13053	That's for the uh - proper authorities who have control over those tapes to make that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	13054	Well, I cannot see where a $.50 a gallon tax applied to gasoline would have changed the price of gasoline.	0
ClaimBuster	13055	Senator Kennedy and I are candidates for the presidency of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	13056	As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life.	0
ClaimBuster	13057	And finally, we don't want to have military involvement there.	1
ClaimBuster	13058	Will they create jobs in America?	0
ClaimBuster	13059	I think we were right to pass the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, which says you can't lose your health insurance just because you change jobs or because someone in your family's been sick.	1
ClaimBuster	13060	But America cannot stand pat.	0
ClaimBuster	13061	And over the long run they will be more reliable partners.	0
ClaimBuster	13062	But in the presidency, a lot goes into it.	0
ClaimBuster	13063	And she worked hard every day and made a lot of sacrifices to make sure we got everything we needed.	0
ClaimBuster	13064	Democrats and Republicans said Bob Dole's word is good.	1
ClaimBuster	13065	And my judgment is that they don't want to give their freedom up to become Communists.	0
ClaimBuster	13066	This is not my best friend.	0
ClaimBuster	13067	So to answer your question, it requires a clear vision, a willingness to stand by our friends, and the credibility for people both friend and foe to understand when America says something, we mean it.	0
ClaimBuster	13068	You know, a lot of you remember the tragedy of 9/11 and where you were on that day and, you know, how all of the country was ready to come together and make enormous changes to make us not only safer, but to make us a better country and a more unified country.	0
ClaimBuster	13069	And, yes, I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives.	1
ClaimBuster	13070	When you're president of the US, you cannot have this pattern of saying well, I'm for it but I'm on the other side of it.	0
ClaimBuster	13071	Because it's gotten a little ugly out there.	0
ClaimBuster	13072	But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have.	1
ClaimBuster	13073	Before I was sworn in, the policy of this government was to have bilateral negotiations with North Korea.	1
ClaimBuster	13074	That's why we're bringing Al Qaida to justice.	0
ClaimBuster	13075	Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard.	0
ClaimBuster	13076	No other nation would have cut defense as much as we already have without that.	0
ClaimBuster	13077	Is it in our nation's interests?	0
ClaimBuster	13078	It's going to increase revenues to the federal government, and it's going to create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	13079	But it's important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top.	0
ClaimBuster	13080	Will we have equal opportunity?	0
ClaimBuster	13081	I have roundly condemned those acts.	1
ClaimBuster	13082	Every plan that I have laid out -- my health-care plan, my plan for education, my plan for kids to be able to get better college loans -- I've shown exactly how I'm going to pay for those.	1
ClaimBuster	13083	The president has tried, but his policies haven't worked.	0
ClaimBuster	13084	And I think this shows a callous indifference to the families that have suffered so much.	0
ClaimBuster	13085	Until about five months ago the Japanese economy was in a deep recession.	1
ClaimBuster	13086	I know it's tough and honest people can disagree.	0
ClaimBuster	13087	Those are the -- the cornerstones of my plan.	0
ClaimBuster	13088	This economy is starting to run downhill.	0
ClaimBuster	13089	If you're a family of four making $50,000 in Missouri, you get a 50% cut in your federal income taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	13090	It seems to me that in this election, the focus should not be on the executive branch but the corrections should come as the voters vote for their members of the House of Representatives or for their United States senator.	0
ClaimBuster	13091	Well, one thing I did was oppose the government takeover health care that President Clinton offered in 1993, which created 17 new taxes and 50 new bureaucracies and price controls, because we were afraid the very thing you mentioned would have happened.	1
ClaimBuster	13092	There's no ceasefire in Bosnia.	1
ClaimBuster	13093	And that's the way it's always been, and that's the way it always will be.	0
ClaimBuster	13094	One of the key tests of leadership is whether one sees clearly the nature of the problems confronted by our nation.	0
ClaimBuster	13095	But it asked the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more.	1
ClaimBuster	13096	wouldn't it be nice to be the ice man so you never make a mistake?	0
ClaimBuster	13097	And it was a smart move because there's gas reserves up there.	1
ClaimBuster	13098	The problem we have today is like the patient's bill of rights, particularly with health care, there's a lot of bickering in Washington, D.C.	0
ClaimBuster	13099	... it just shows you're not up to doing the job.	0
ClaimBuster	13100	And I want to make sure that the next generation has those same opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	13101	And I simply don't believe we can afford nor do we need to keep 150,000 troops in Europe given how much the Red Army, now under the control of Russia, has been cut, the arms control agreement concluded between Mr. Bush and Mr. Yeltsin, something I have applauded.	1
ClaimBuster	13102	Our education system can be improved.	0
ClaimBuster	13103	"They don't like the use of the word, but may I remind his strong supporters that only last year in the primary, to capture that Democratic nomination, he said, ""I am a progressive liberal Democrat."""	1
ClaimBuster	13104	It may be because of our experiences.	0
ClaimBuster	13105	I do think there are special experiences and judgments and backgrounds and understandings that women bring to this process, by the way.	0
ClaimBuster	13106	Our country is so, so -- it's just so imperative that we have the right justices.	0
ClaimBuster	13107	And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy.	0
ClaimBuster	13108	Now, that ought to get everybody back up to let's get along together and make it work.	0
ClaimBuster	13109	That's one of the things I want to change.	0
ClaimBuster	13110	You know, under my leadership, what we've done is reformed education, working with governors, 46 states.	1
ClaimBuster	13111	Of course, we're paying attention to these.	0
ClaimBuster	13112	What kind of America do you want to have for yourself and for your children.	0
ClaimBuster	13113	Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	13114	This seems to me is criticism that again is wrong on his part.	0
ClaimBuster	13115	And it's estimated that that will create 800,000 new jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	13116	And our team of -- our country's team over there did a great job.	0
ClaimBuster	13117	The secretary of state has made better than fifty speeches all over the United States explaining American foreign policy.	1
ClaimBuster	13118	Because there -- there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	13119	Let me give you some advice.	0
ClaimBuster	13120	First I want to compliment the governor on his response to those fires and floods in Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	13121	Well, I've never, ever used the harshest word, as you did just then.	1
ClaimBuster	13122	That is not who America is.	0
ClaimBuster	13123	A lot of people are busy and it's hard for them to just get there and vote.	0
ClaimBuster	13124	There's no way to make a prediction that my family might be able to own a home or to put my kid through college.	0
ClaimBuster	13125	I see the valley below, and it's a valley of peace.	0
ClaimBuster	13126	You know how I know?	0
ClaimBuster	13127	I think it's a matter that we should continue to uh - give uh - great care and attention to.	0
ClaimBuster	13128	Drugs are pouring in through the border.	1
ClaimBuster	13129	And then the war was very badly mishandled.	0
ClaimBuster	13130	And we're going to make America wealthy again, because if you don't do that, it just -- it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.	0
ClaimBuster	13131	Each one of those jobs would've cost the taxpayers $25 thousand.	0
ClaimBuster	13132	One of them happened just the other day, when a man I admire and respect -- I've written about him -- Congressman John Lewis, an American hero, made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter in American history, segregation, deaths of children in church bombings, George Wallace.	1
ClaimBuster	13133	In the last uh - two weeks, I've had a chance to talk to uh - two men who have visited uh - the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and China.	1
ClaimBuster	13134	I need to be able to get home at 5 o'clock so I can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school.	1
ClaimBuster	13135	We now have a $2.6 trillion deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	13136	What I worry about with the president is that he's not acknowledging what's on the ground, he's not acknowledging the realities of North Korea, he's not acknowledging the truth of the science of stem-cell research or of global warming and other issues.	1
ClaimBuster	13137	I will say this: in the event that such an attack occurred and in the event the attack was a prelude to an attack on Formosa - which would be the indication today because the Chinese Communists say over and over again that their objective is not the offshore islands, that they consider them only steppingstones to taking Formosa - in the event that their attack then were a prelude to an attack on Formosa, there isn't any question but that the United States would then again, as in the case of Berlin, honor our treaty obligations and stand by our ally of Formosa.	1
ClaimBuster	13138	We need a new military and a new national security policy equal to the challenges of a post cold war era, a smaller permanent military force, but one that is more mobile, well trained with high technology equipment.	0
ClaimBuster	13139	And they got the ultimate punishment.	1
ClaimBuster	13140	And one final comment, uh - Governor Carter talks about the tax bills and all of the inequities that exist in the present law.	1
ClaimBuster	13141	So in my judgment we would spend more money in this Administration on aid to education, we'd spend more money on housing, we'd spend more money and I hope more wisely on defense than this Administration has.	0
ClaimBuster	13142	It will help you in whatever you're going to do in the next few years.	0
ClaimBuster	13143	I want to see the McKinney Act fully funded.	0
ClaimBuster	13144	Now Senator Kennedy a moment ago referred to the fact that there was not an adequate Voice of America program for Latin America.	1
ClaimBuster	13145	Governor Carter apparently doesn't know the facts.	0
ClaimBuster	13146	China may have it by 1963, Egypt.	0
ClaimBuster	13147	Culture of life is really important for a country to have if it's going to be a hospitable society.	0
ClaimBuster	13148	And there's a lot of good people working hard.	0
ClaimBuster	13149	But I also believe something else about that.	0
ClaimBuster	13150	It was only when the Supreme Court handed down a decision that the Federal Government intervened in what had always been a State policy.	1
ClaimBuster	13151	My attitude is you ain't seen nothing yet.	0
ClaimBuster	13152	Now what do the Chinese Communists want?	0
ClaimBuster	13153	Nobody should have any doubt about that, least of all our adversaries or potential adversaries.	0
ClaimBuster	13154	And then, after it worked, I was told that lowering taxes would increase inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	13155	Secondly, there have been statements made that uh - the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	13156	Your your Social Security is going to be there when you retire.	0
ClaimBuster	13157	That's why I want to continue the work we have done over partisan opposition, to work with communities to bring that crime rate down until our streets are all safe again.	0
ClaimBuster	13158	I know how the do that, my friends.	0
ClaimBuster	13159	I want to close loopholes that allow companies to deduct expenses when they move to China; that allow them to profit offshore and not have to get taxed, so they have tax advantages offshore.	1
ClaimBuster	13160	If those two powers should split, it could have great effects throughout the entire world.	0
ClaimBuster	13161	I was up in New Hampshire the other day.	1
ClaimBuster	13162	And if you pass the big drug companies' bill, nothing will happen.	0
ClaimBuster	13163	Our nation needs to be credible and strong.	0
ClaimBuster	13164	I applaud them for it, I don't criticize them.	0
ClaimBuster	13165	And when they meet, that is a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	13166	I was responsible for the amendment with Senator Monroney in 1954 to strengthen our ground forces.	1
ClaimBuster	13167	We're putting more money per child into education, and we are not performing as we should.	1
ClaimBuster	13168	America stands tall again, and as a result, we are credible.	0
ClaimBuster	13169	Why that's more than the average teacher makes.	1
ClaimBuster	13170	He's a dear and beloved friend to all of us.	0
ClaimBuster	13171	Is this a war-torn country?	0
ClaimBuster	13172	The minimum wage is the lowest minimum wage value it has been in our nation in 50 years.	1
ClaimBuster	13173	They know that she's a role model to women and other -- and reformers all over America.	0
ClaimBuster	13174	I want competition and I want to pool the insurance and take care of it that way and have -- oh, here's the other point.	0
ClaimBuster	13175	I'm looking for judges -- and I've actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	13176	I have a simple philosophy that I tried to follow for the last four years: Do what creates opportunity for all, what reinforces responsibility from all of us, and what will help us build a community where everybody's got a role to play and a place at the table.	0
ClaimBuster	13177	Certainly anyone in the White House should have the character to be there.	0
ClaimBuster	13178	And it literally says to the communities, re-invent the schools, not just the bricks and mortar but the curriculum and everything else.	0
ClaimBuster	13179	But the point is, that - that a president ought to lead this country.	0
ClaimBuster	13180	If the question -- maybe I -- get it wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	13181	I have personally told President Pack that the United States does not condone the kind of repressive measures that he has taken in that country.	1
ClaimBuster	13182	You've made a lot of it because of the fact that you've been in office.	1
ClaimBuster	13183	It's 10 cents a year cumulative.	1
ClaimBuster	13184	It was in the previous administration, in the Bush-Quayle administration, and I think in retrospect the lessons there are ones that we should take very, very seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	13185	Number two, I asked the president a question I think Hispanics and immigrants all over the nation have asked.	1
ClaimBuster	13186	If you want to do a voucher program in Missouri, fine.	0
ClaimBuster	13187	We've got to invest and grow.	0
ClaimBuster	13188	The Shah, whatever he might have done, was building low-cost housing, had taken land away from the Mullahs and was distributing it to the peasants so they could be landowners -- things of that kind.	1
ClaimBuster	13189	Depends on what he says in the future in the campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	13190	These are all the things, I think, in this country that can make our society strong, or can mean that it stands still.	0
ClaimBuster	13191	Now, the taxes are a very simple thing.	0
ClaimBuster	13192	Well, there are summits being held.	1
ClaimBuster	13193	Now, it is trillions of dollars out of balance, and the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history - the payroll tax increase for Social Security - which will only put a band-aid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most.	1
ClaimBuster	13194	But I think it's a very interesting proposal, to see if we can find, first of all, something that renders those weapons obsolete, incapable of their mission.	0
ClaimBuster	13195	But more importantly it is true that in order for us to be competitive, we're going to have to make some smart choices right now.	0
ClaimBuster	13196	But I don't favor a constitutional amendment on the subject.	0
ClaimBuster	13197	Than they are on research and development.	0
ClaimBuster	13198	Because we ended the war in Iraq, we were able to refocus our attention on not only the terrorist threat, but also beginning a transition process in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	13199	Whatever happened to the element of surprise, OK?	0
ClaimBuster	13200	"But I must say I'm a little offended by this word ""scheme."""	0
ClaimBuster	13201	And he could do the job.	0
ClaimBuster	13202	We've got to change it.	0
ClaimBuster	13203	There has never been a weapon invented in the history of man that has not led to a defensive, a counterweapon.	1
ClaimBuster	13204	It's -- the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	13205	Gosh, I just don't think I ever said I'm not worried about Osama bin Laden.	1
ClaimBuster	13206	Senator Kennedy's position and mine completely different on this.	0
ClaimBuster	13207	They've intermarried with Al Qaida and the Taliban.	1
ClaimBuster	13208	Why can't we have that once again?	0
ClaimBuster	13209	I know the President's been puffing a lot on that.	0
ClaimBuster	13210	Well, my strategy is pretty straightforward, which is to go after the bad guys, to make sure we do our very best to interrupt them, to -- to kill them, to take them out of the picture.	0
ClaimBuster	13211	ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	13212	Meanwhile, they were getting all kinds of money in campaign contributions.	1
ClaimBuster	13213	General Twining, in January, fifty-nine, described the position of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	13214	We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of.	0
ClaimBuster	13215	We can put the Communists on the defensive.	0
ClaimBuster	13216	They did after he left.	1
ClaimBuster	13217	They convince the international community they are not pursuing a nuclear program.	1
ClaimBuster	13218	Reduce the capital gains rate.	0
ClaimBuster	13219	As a matter of fact, oil production is down 14 percent this year on federal land, and gas production was down 9 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	13220	And it would be a federal law preventing that.	0
ClaimBuster	13221	Under the last Democratic administration 60 percent of all weapons that went into the Middle East were for Israel.	1
ClaimBuster	13222	That's not going to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	13223	We've lost the vision of what our country can and ought to be.	0
ClaimBuster	13224	I thought during his debate with Senator Bradley saying he authored the EITC when it didn't happen.	1
ClaimBuster	13225	You know we've suffered discrimination in the disability community.	0
ClaimBuster	13226	There is a great program called Project Exile in Richmond, Virginia, where we focused federal taxpayers' money and federal prosecutors and went after people who were illegally using guns.	1
ClaimBuster	13227	Well, I'll tell you what it means.	0
ClaimBuster	13228	They start from a much lower base.	0
ClaimBuster	13229	I was there for a while before I left on June the 11th.	1
ClaimBuster	13230	I have a plan for doing that.	0
ClaimBuster	13231	I feel very strongly about the people who go into battle for our country.	0
ClaimBuster	13232	The Vice President believes only the right people ought to get tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	13233	Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they're telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence.	1
ClaimBuster	13234	The plans are all over Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	13235	Now, I feel very strongly about a lot of things.	0
ClaimBuster	13236	That's not right in America.	0
ClaimBuster	13237	That turned out to be wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	13238	We've made every one of them eligible for a tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	13239	If this were a spending contest, I would come in second.	0
ClaimBuster	13240	The member of a labor union must have his rights strengthened and broadened and our children in their education should have an opportunity to improve themselves based on their talents and their abilities.	0
ClaimBuster	13241	And we're doing just that.	0
ClaimBuster	13242	The safest of federal investments yields 4%.	1
ClaimBuster	13243	I want regulators to see their job as encouraging small enterprise, not crushing it.	0
ClaimBuster	13244	But I'm totally opposed to discrimination.	0
ClaimBuster	13245	If we turn to Helsinki - I'm glad you raised it, Mr. uh - Frankel.	0
ClaimBuster	13246	And we fixed it for a reason: because there are too many people still in this country who feel the stark resistance of racism, and so we have a distance to travel.	0
ClaimBuster	13247	For 3 months -- quarters I've been fighting, 3 quarters been fighting to get the Congress to pass some incentives for small business.	1
ClaimBuster	13248	And the answer they came up with was this:	0
ClaimBuster	13249	And we've had many successful Muslims.	1
ClaimBuster	13250	And Texas is number one in industrial pollution.	1
ClaimBuster	13251	Guinea and Ghana, two independent countries within the last three years - Guinea in fifty-seven, Ghana within the last eighteen months - both now are supporting the Soviet foreign policy at the U.N. Mr. Herter said so himself.	1
ClaimBuster	13252	And in the field of executive leadership, I can say that I believe it's essential that the president of the United States not only set the tone but he also must lead; he must act as he talks.	0
ClaimBuster	13253	I'll tell you where we disagree.	0
ClaimBuster	13254	Now we have a runaway arms race.	0
ClaimBuster	13255	But that's how we're going to win the peace, by rapidly training the Iraqis themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	13256	It was higher when I came into office.	1
ClaimBuster	13257	And then we're going to have to get to a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	13258	Now, but here is why it's directly relevant, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	13259	Premiums have gotten too high.	1
ClaimBuster	13260	We didn't have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops.	1
ClaimBuster	13261	I have opposed drawing a line because I know that the moment you draw a line, that is an encouragement for the Communists to attack - to step up their blackmail and to force you into the war that none of us want.	0
ClaimBuster	13262	I have made myself at least ten uh - speeches in various parts of the country where I have discussed with the American people defense and foreign policy.	1
ClaimBuster	13263	Will they raise incomes in America?	0
ClaimBuster	13264	Well, Americans have gotten to know Sarah Palin.	0
ClaimBuster	13265	And her son had been shot through the head.	1
ClaimBuster	13266	We've expanded Pell Grants for millions of people, including millions of young women, all across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	13267	My passion is to pass a jobs program and get incomes up with an investment incentive program to grow jobs in the private sector, to waste less public money and invest more, to control health care costs and provide for affordable health care for all Americans and to make sure we've got the best trained workforce in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	13268	Let me just finish the point.	0
ClaimBuster	13269	And you know, you've seen the list, I've seen the list, we won't go into the names, but no wonder they -- if I had those people around me all day every day, telling me it was fair and free, I might believe it.	0
ClaimBuster	13270	Mr. President, Mr. President, you're entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts.	0
ClaimBuster	13271	And my economic plan calls for that.	0
ClaimBuster	13272	"And DeGaulle waved them off and said, ""No, no, no, no."	1
ClaimBuster	13273	And I said, well, yes.	0
ClaimBuster	13274	And I just don't think that dog will hunt this time.	0
ClaimBuster	13275	The payroll taxes are your money.	1
ClaimBuster	13276	Now, I've got a plan with this new welfare reform law to work with the private sector, to give employees specific tax incentives to hire people off welfare, and to do some other things which will create more jobs in the private sector, at least a million, and move more people from welfare to work.	0
ClaimBuster	13277	Number two, we have to make America the most attractive place for entrepreneurs, for people who want to expand their business.	0
ClaimBuster	13278	This has been probably the biggest whopper that's been told during the course of this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	13279	Now, I know that we have some disagreements on this.	0
ClaimBuster	13280	Well, let's step back and talk about what's happening in Syria and how important it is.	0
ClaimBuster	13281	If we're smart and if we trust workers and if we understand the power of the compounding rate of interest.	0
ClaimBuster	13282	But a President must also have a vision of where this nation should go.	0
ClaimBuster	13283	Well, he's better off than he was four years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	13284	But in terms of being influenced by women and being a minority, there they are right out there, my wife and my 4 beautiful daughters, and I just have 1 son, so he and I are surrounded by women, giving -- telling us what to do all the time.	1
ClaimBuster	13285	Of course, both er - Senator Kennedy and I have felt Mr. Truman's ire; and uh - consequently, I think he can speak with some feeling on this subject.	0
ClaimBuster	13286	I thought they would stay and fight, but they didn't.	0
ClaimBuster	13287	Even if you put his income up ten percent, that would be two and three-quarters percent three pers- or three cents out of that twenty-five cents.	1
ClaimBuster	13288	And I believe that if we can get a party which believes in movement, which believes in going ahead, then we can reestablish our position in the world - strong defense, strong in economic growth, justice for our people, co- guarantee of constitutional rights, so that people will believe that we practice what we preach, and then around the world, particularly to try to reestablish the atmosphere which existed in Latin America at the time of Franklin Roosevelt.	0
ClaimBuster	13289	My view is that you can do these programs - and they should be carefully drawn - within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	13290	And our alliance is strong.	0
ClaimBuster	13291	I cannot believe I'm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.	0
ClaimBuster	13292	When I campaigned in a race, a lot of folks didn't think I could win including, by the way, my mother.	1
ClaimBuster	13293	He talked about a nuclear freeze back at the time when I was in Europe trying to convince European public opinion that we ought to go forward with the deployment of the INF weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	13294	Let me give you a story about public education, if I might.	0
ClaimBuster	13295	Then we want to give modest middle-class tax relief to restore some fairness, especially to middle- class people with families with incomes of under $60,000.	0
ClaimBuster	13296	And that takes a lot of planning and preparation.	0
ClaimBuster	13297	You did it in 1985.	1
ClaimBuster	13298	Our program was an amendment to the Kerr bill.	1
ClaimBuster	13299	I mean, we thought we'd whip more of them going in.	0
ClaimBuster	13300	Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?	0
ClaimBuster	13301	Voters will know I'll put competent judges on the bench.	0
ClaimBuster	13302	Therefore, the burden of maintaining the peace falls on us.	0
ClaimBuster	13303	We have a divided nation.	0
ClaimBuster	13304	I've met them, people like Mary Annie and Edward Davis in Nashua, New Hampshire.	1
ClaimBuster	13305	Well, I was interested in Senator Obama's reaction to the Russian aggression against Georgia.	0
ClaimBuster	13306	I've been fighting for proliferation the entire time -- anti-proliferation the entire time I've been in the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	13307	By contrast, Donald's plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	13308	These crooks -- now, Willie Sutton would have gone to own a savings and loan rather than rob banks, because he robbed banks because that's where the money is; owning a savings and loan is where the money was.	1
ClaimBuster	13309	He has about a third as much chance to be a professional man, about half as much chance to own a house.	1
ClaimBuster	13310	But I have common sense.	0
ClaimBuster	13311	We spend six hundred dollars per person in this country - every man, woman and child - for health care.	1
ClaimBuster	13312	You're not going to have the opportunities; there are going to be more deficits, more drugs, more crime, and less confidence in the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	13313	That's the importance of party; only if it tells something about the record.	0
ClaimBuster	13314	But we have no leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	13315	Ross was very articulate across the country.	0
ClaimBuster	13316	The last eight years the average growth has been about two and a half per cent.	1
ClaimBuster	13317	And I am not going to lay down my arms in the middle of the campaign for somebody who has got no credibility on the issue.	0
ClaimBuster	13318	I don't think you can just rely on U.N. sanctions, Randee.	0
ClaimBuster	13319	I'll make one more point.	0
ClaimBuster	13320	We're quarantining him diplomatically by bringing back our Ambassador; economically by cutting off trade, and Senator Kennedy's suggestion that the trade that we cut off is not significant is just one hundred percent wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	13321	I think that's a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	13322	"Third, I would say this with regard to this report, with regard to Gallup Polls of prestige abroad and everything else that we've been hearing about ""what about American prestige abroad"": America's prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesmen for America allow it to be."	0
ClaimBuster	13323	But still, it's good that at least once, all three of us were heard by the people of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	13324	I like the policies that will encourage farmers to put -- set aside land as well for conservation purposes.	0
ClaimBuster	13325	So the polls to me are interesting, but they don't determine, you know, my hopes or - or my despair.	0
ClaimBuster	13326	I think that decisions should rest in the hands of the states.	0
ClaimBuster	13327	"When Mr. Reagan raised this uh - question in Florida uh - Mr. Ford not only disavowed his instructions, but he also even dropped, parenthetically, the use of the word ""detente."""	1
ClaimBuster	13328	I believe that there is enough extravagance and fat in government.	0
ClaimBuster	13329	We have work to do to fight a real war, not a phony war, against drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	13330	It's just going to be talk.	0
ClaimBuster	13331	This is what I deeply believe.	0
ClaimBuster	13332	And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.	0
ClaimBuster	13333	Let's start with a premise.	0
ClaimBuster	13334	Our economic strength is still there.	0
ClaimBuster	13335	I know that uh Chief Justice Burger is.	0
ClaimBuster	13336	We've taken no strong position in the uh - control of pollution of our oceans, and I would say the worst uh - threat to the environment of all is nuclear proliferation.	0
ClaimBuster	13337	One thing I will not do is sock every business in the country and, thus, throw some people out of work.	0
ClaimBuster	13338	Every time the United States has been an one side and they've been on the other side, our position has been sustained.	1
ClaimBuster	13339	And I am convinced that the alternate proposals that I have, that the Republicans have in the field of health, in the field of education, in the field of welfare, because they are not extreme, because they will accomplish the end uh - without too great cost in dollars or in freedom, that they could get through the next Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	13340	I think it is a worthy goal in America to have every child protected by law and welcomed in life.	0
ClaimBuster	13341	And therefore, I have been in favor of a separate minimum for them.	0
ClaimBuster	13342	Twenty new countries in Africa during the course of this Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	13343	I want to quote somebody a little closer to home, Harry Truman.	0
ClaimBuster	13344	And I can assure you that if we had not taken the strong and forceful action that we did, we would have been uh - criticized very, very uh - severely for sitting back and not moving.	0
ClaimBuster	13345	And I may be better off four years from now, but I don't know.	0
ClaimBuster	13346	I want us to do more to help small business.	0
ClaimBuster	13347	But it is good for America to improve fuel efficiency.	0
ClaimBuster	13348	And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security.	1
ClaimBuster	13349	So it seems to me that there's also a public trust.	0
ClaimBuster	13350	Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue.	1
ClaimBuster	13351	It is essential that America's word be good.	0
ClaimBuster	13352	But she is raising your taxes and I'm lowering your taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	13353	Again, you can look it up.	0
ClaimBuster	13354	As far as what experience counts and whether that is experience that counts, that isn't for me to say.	0
ClaimBuster	13355	Seventy percent of my state's money goes to the public schools, and I was really honored when Time magazine said that our schools have shown more improvement than any other state in the country except one other -- they named 2 states showing real strides forward in the 80s.	1
ClaimBuster	13356	... to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it, as well.	1
ClaimBuster	13357	They've been talking about it in Washington, D.C.	1
ClaimBuster	13358	I have fought time after time against these pork barrel -- these bills that come to the floor and they have all kinds of goodies and all kinds of things in them for everybody and they buy off the votes.	0
ClaimBuster	13359	Well, the Massachusetts furlough program was unique.	1
ClaimBuster	13360	If the people send me to Washington the first thing I'll do is study that 2000-page agreement and make sure it's a 2-way street.	0
ClaimBuster	13361	And I would like to urge the school superintendents and the others around the country to stand up now and keep us moving forward on a path towards real excellence.	0
ClaimBuster	13362	There are some problem banks out there.	1
ClaimBuster	13363	And therefore just kids were being shuffled through the school.	0
ClaimBuster	13364	Do you know that we've laid a $10 trillion debt on these young Americans who are here with us tonight, $500 billion of it we owe to China?	1
ClaimBuster	13365	Why didn't you do it?	0
ClaimBuster	13366	These are the policies I have fought for my entire career.	1
ClaimBuster	13367	I would ask him to name one Republican president who led this nation into war.	0
ClaimBuster	13368	Yeah, I can't imagine what it would be like to be singled out because of race and stopped and harassed.	0
ClaimBuster	13369	This deal is terribly destructive to the US airline industry.	0
ClaimBuster	13370	It's a system that cries out for accountability and transparency and the adequate funding.	0
ClaimBuster	13371	Let me say first of all, I want to answer your specific question but first of all, we all agree that there should be a growing economy.	0
ClaimBuster	13372	It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages.	1
ClaimBuster	13373	I think they will, and I think we'll get there.	0
ClaimBuster	13374	Ukraine, right now, is in the sights of Vladimir Putin, those that want to reassemble the old Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	13375	I think of classroom teachers, classroom teachers that I have had, classroom teachers that youngsters have today who are real heroes to our young people.	0
ClaimBuster	13376	And you might find those words in a Democratic platform of some years ago -- I know, because I was a Democrat at that time.	1
ClaimBuster	13377	Because we've got to make sure that our economy is strong at home so that we can project military power overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	13378	What I called it, I labeled it affirmative access.	1
ClaimBuster	13379	And I want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home, and not in defeat, that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	13380	I don't think that'll work.	0
ClaimBuster	13381	And my first organization was just four or five people plus my wife and my children, my three sons and their wives.	1
ClaimBuster	13382	And Assad -- excuse me, Kofi Annan came in and said we're going to try to have a ceasefire.	1
ClaimBuster	13383	I don't think you can secure America for the long run if you don't have a comprehensive view as to how to defeat these people.	0
ClaimBuster	13384	It takes public money and gives it to families or individuals to choose the school they want.	1
ClaimBuster	13385	And I beg the American people, any time they think about reforming education to take this piece of society that doesn't have a chance and take these little pieces of clay that can be shaped and molded and give them the same love and nurture and affection and support you give your children and teach them that they're unique and that they're precious and that there's only one person in the world like them and you will see this nation bloom.	0
ClaimBuster	13386	And they went out and bought up these mortgages.	1
ClaimBuster	13387	We're the leading donor in the world to help the suffering people there.	1
ClaimBuster	13388	I demanded an apology from Vice President Bush because I had, instead, honored these young men, grieved for their families, and think they were wonderful Americans that honored us all.	1
ClaimBuster	13389	I admire the fact that he is a great dad.	0
ClaimBuster	13390	What was the other part of it?	0
ClaimBuster	13391	So what I've tried to do is be consistent.	0
ClaimBuster	13392	I'm here tonight for these young people up here in the balcony from this college.	1
ClaimBuster	13393	He said he would reform it.	1
ClaimBuster	13394	You haven't just accepted research, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	13395	I found that, in this world, that it's important to establish good personal relationships with people so that when you have disagreements, you're able to disagree in a way that is effective.	0
ClaimBuster	13396	Over the next four years, we'll make sure the economy continues to grow.	0
ClaimBuster	13397	I don't know what other weapons the Vice President is talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	13398	So I am one who believes that we can	0
ClaimBuster	13399	I want to go down the path of growth that puts Americans to work with more money coming in because they're working.	0
ClaimBuster	13400	Look, I've got five boys.	1
ClaimBuster	13401	I do not want to see us go to again and Fm using this word advisedly a liberal majority that is going to legislate from the Bench.	0
ClaimBuster	13402	That's just one example of how you can save money and improve the quality of life at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	13403	I'm proud that we're better off on that than we were four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	13404	They have poor-quality health care.	1
ClaimBuster	13405	My best friend from grade school is a computer software salesman and he told me last time he changed employers it took him nine months to figure out how to transfer his 401K plan.	1
ClaimBuster	13406	We're going to have trade, but we're going -- we're going to terminate it, we're going to make a great trade deal.	0
ClaimBuster	13407	Our coalition against Saddam is unraveling.	0
ClaimBuster	13408	In Georgia alone, for instance, I got 84 percent of the vote, and I think there were fourteen people uh - in addition to myself on the ballot, and Governor Wallace had been very strong in Georgia.	1
ClaimBuster	13409	It's time for the man to go.	0
ClaimBuster	13410	We give them $1.7 billion in cash.	1
ClaimBuster	13411	I can't tell you how many people I meet who don't have health insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	13412	And they include you and me.	0
ClaimBuster	13413	And we have not set an example for our own people.	0
ClaimBuster	13414	It says to you as a taxpayer -- say you're going to pay a tax of 1000 bucks or something.	0
ClaimBuster	13415	You know, WikiLeaks just actually came out -- John Podesta said some horrible things about you, and, boy, was he right.	1
ClaimBuster	13416	We need to be thinking about cyber security.	0
ClaimBuster	13417	But I want to warn my fellow citizens: The cost of doing nothing, the cost of saying the current system is OK, far exceeds the costs of trying to make sure we save the system for our children.	1
ClaimBuster	13418	So it's not just the addition of troops that matters.	0
ClaimBuster	13419	So we're going to have to make some investments, but we've also got to make spending cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	13420	We still have some of that hatred inside us.	0
ClaimBuster	13421	The problem I see is that there are too many guns getting into the hands of children, and criminals, and people who, for whatever reason, some kind of history of stalking or domestic abuse really should not be able to get guns.	0
ClaimBuster	13422	No, but you got to go back to what social security was when it was created.	0
ClaimBuster	13423	A judicious use of the military which will help keep the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	13424	But look, let me sum it up.	0
ClaimBuster	13425	We can invite all the candidates.	0
ClaimBuster	13426	That's not the main issue.	0
ClaimBuster	13427	We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years.	1
ClaimBuster	13428	But as far as the accessibility of them by the American people, it's very uh - far in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	13429	I'll take the pledge because I know the American people want to talk about issues and not tabloid journalism.	0
ClaimBuster	13430	It is working, and we're going to continue on that same line.	1
ClaimBuster	13431	I think the man anybody that gets into this political arena and has to face you guys everyday deserves a word of praise.	0
ClaimBuster	13432	They continue to modernize and we can't simply we've got enough nuclear weapons, let's freeze.	0
ClaimBuster	13433	Donald has said he's in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood.	1
ClaimBuster	13434	Last year there were twenty-nine and tomorrow when the preliminary vote is held you will see a strengthening of that position or very closely to it.	1
ClaimBuster	13435	We resolved, we rescued Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	13436	Not if I didn't have a better idea.	0
ClaimBuster	13437	But I am not in favor of the plan that is so costly.	0
ClaimBuster	13438	It didn't exceed beyond mine, because I know that that's a strategy that has worked and can succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	13439	More Americans at work today than any time in history, a greater percentage of the work force.	1
ClaimBuster	13440	Instead of the federal government, we had that tax credit, pick up some of the costs, because if you have to hire a replacement worker, that's a cost.	0
ClaimBuster	13441	I will make sure we don't hurt the functioning of our -- of our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	13442	I want to give every middle-class family a $10,000 a year tax deduction for college tuition so that middle-class families will always be able to send their kids on to college.	0
ClaimBuster	13443	And the formula I've given you works, we've put it through a good economic model, we've got good economists on the West Coast, Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there who's a very respected economist in the - Massachusetts.	1
ClaimBuster	13444	I believe in its future.	0
ClaimBuster	13445	We had an even worse oil shock in 1979.	1
ClaimBuster	13446	I hope it isn't Christmas when you make that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	13447	So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now.	0
ClaimBuster	13448	It's the most successful thing we've ever done.	0
ClaimBuster	13449	We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	13450	I don't think a president can unilaterally overturn it.	0
ClaimBuster	13451	I think we uh - could call together, with strong leadership in the White House, business, industry and labor, and say let's have voluntary price restraints.	0
ClaimBuster	13452	They didn't have the right body armor.	1
ClaimBuster	13453	His running mate Jack Kemp once said that Bob Dole never met a tax he didn't hike.	1
ClaimBuster	13454	Let me say, first of all, I signed a tort reform bill that dealt with civilian aviation a couple of years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	13455	I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do.	1
ClaimBuster	13456	Now, Prime Minister Allawi came here, and he said the terrorists are pouring over the border.	1
ClaimBuster	13457	That is a national outrage.	0
ClaimBuster	13458	Now, uh - I'd like to point out as well that the United States' economic recovery from the recession of a year ago is well ahead of the economic recovery of any major free industrial nation in the world today.	1
ClaimBuster	13459	We -- we think of their families and care for them deeply.	0
ClaimBuster	13460	Whatever it is, whatever the checklist was in '92, it's all done with campaign finance reform.	1
ClaimBuster	13461	Here's some help for you to go to a community college.	0
ClaimBuster	13462	And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance.	0
ClaimBuster	13463	So the answer is I could do that.	0
ClaimBuster	13464	Are you going to go after Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and the handicapped again as you did last time?	0
ClaimBuster	13465	And there will be a significant transition.	0
ClaimBuster	13466	This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.	0
ClaimBuster	13467	That's why I do feel if some police officer is gunned down that the death penalty is required.	0
ClaimBuster	13468	My priority is making sure that we get more people hired.	0
ClaimBuster	13469	It can't do it all, but it can make a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	13470	He didn't call for self-deportation.	1
ClaimBuster	13471	Now that's what we have to do.	0
ClaimBuster	13472	When my grandfather fought in World War II and he came back and he got a G.I.	1
ClaimBuster	13473	There's not someone there directing all of this activity.	0
ClaimBuster	13474	I think I did the right thing.	0
ClaimBuster	13475	That's part of what happened in Afghanistan, where we rushed into Iraq and Senator McCain and President Bush suggested that it wasn't that important to catch bin Laden right now and that we could muddle through, and that has cost us dearly.	1
ClaimBuster	13476	So the point is that we will prevail in Afghanistan, but we need the new strategy and we need it to succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	13477	It's the fact that all the -- all of the details need to be known about Senator Obama's relationship with them and with ACORN and the American people will make a judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	13478	And so I think we need to think differently.	0
ClaimBuster	13479	It's a question of character and judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	13480	Did it make him withdraw from the north?	0
ClaimBuster	13481	We're going to have to sit down across the table, Republican and Democrat, as we did in 1983 between Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.	1
ClaimBuster	13482	Well, I think we need tough enforcement of the civil rights laws.	0
ClaimBuster	13483	And I said at that time that one of the things that we could do, that perhaps would save as much as $5 billion to $7 billion, according, to one of the leading members of the House Budget Committee, was to recalculate the index that is used to determine the cost of living benefits that are paid to civil service retirees, to military retirees.	1
ClaimBuster	13484	Well, Candy, actually, in my state, the pro-gun folks and the anti-gun folks came together and put together a piece of legislation.	1
ClaimBuster	13485	Strong, well-equipped, well-trained, well-maintained conventional forces.	0
ClaimBuster	13486	He's got to get this thing more clear.	0
ClaimBuster	13487	We are not investing that surplus like a pension fund.	1
ClaimBuster	13488	The top -- let's talk about my tax plan.	0
ClaimBuster	13489	A President, to defend this country and to get arms control, must master what's going on.	0
ClaimBuster	13490	On looking specifically at the Arkansas record -- he keeps criticizing us, criticizing me, I'm the incumbent, fine.	0
ClaimBuster	13491	We come up with practical, common sense solutions for problems that we're confronted with.	1
ClaimBuster	13492	By the way, number one I get rid of is Obamacare.	0
ClaimBuster	13493	It is the -- the biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	13494	"I remember a lady in Houston, Texas, told me, ""Reading is the new civil right,"" and she's right."	1
ClaimBuster	13495	And so I acknowledge that his daughters -- I've watched them.	1
ClaimBuster	13496	I admire the fact that he served for 20 years in the Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	13497	I'd like to point out that in the last six years, the Democratic Congresses, of which he'd been a member, have cut twenty million dollars off of the Voice of America programs.	1
ClaimBuster	13498	"Then he said, ""I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU."""	1
ClaimBuster	13499	We have a chance in the next 15 years, insisting upon the health and safety of workers in the mines, and also preserving the same high air and water pollution standards, to triple the amount of coal we produce.	0
ClaimBuster	13500	The jobs that are being created in Arizona right now are paying about $13,700 less than the jobs that we're losing.	1
ClaimBuster	13501	They're interested in keeping Assad in power.	1
ClaimBuster	13502	Now, he has to get a better job out of his Congress if he's going to get us the money that we need to conduct the foreign affairs of this country in Latin America or any place else.	0
ClaimBuster	13503	He starts saying, government will do this and government will do that, and then government will, and he'll impose mandates.	0
ClaimBuster	13504	And I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you.	0
ClaimBuster	13505	Iris, this is one where we have some agreement, I think.	0
ClaimBuster	13506	If we make investments now so that people have coverage, that we are preventing diseases, that will save on Medicare and Medicaid in the future.	1
ClaimBuster	13507	And that's where the President has opposed practically every arms control agreement, by every President, of both political parties, since the bomb went off.	1
ClaimBuster	13508	That is the true way I feel.	0
ClaimBuster	13509	In the last four years we've worked hard to promote more competition to bring down the rate of inflation in health care costs without eroding health care quality.	0
ClaimBuster	13510	And we're going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is.	0
ClaimBuster	13511	That tax bill does not entirely meet the criteria that I established.	1
ClaimBuster	13512	Uh - I think this is a responsible and a proper way to proceed.	0
ClaimBuster	13513	I think we all know America is going through tough times right now.	0
ClaimBuster	13514	There are, as you know, CIA men stationed in other countries in the world and, certainly, in Central America.	1
ClaimBuster	13515	The most dangerous aspect of this proposal is, for the first time, we would delegate to computers the decision as to whether to start a war.	0
ClaimBuster	13516	If the tax cut is your number one, two, three and four priority, you can't do education.	1
ClaimBuster	13517	And, you know, I'm frankly amazed that since you grew up 5 blocks from there you would think that what goes on in that state is irrelevant.	1
ClaimBuster	13518	This -- we have weakened our economy.	1
ClaimBuster	13519	Number two, that strip-mining bill would've severely set back our need for more coal, and Governor Carter has said repeatedly that coal is the resource that we need to use more in the effort to become independent of the uh - Arab oil supply.	1
ClaimBuster	13520	When -- when we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no, yes, that was a fight that we needed to have.	0
ClaimBuster	13521	Several years ago, I was given an assignment to write a letter.	1
ClaimBuster	13522	My opponent is for joining the International Criminal Court.	1
ClaimBuster	13523	Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries.	0
ClaimBuster	13524	A hundred thousand Americans a month have lost their health insurance just in the last 4 years.	1
ClaimBuster	13525	But let me talk about something that the president just sort of finished up with.	0
ClaimBuster	13526	"Groucho Marx said, ""Who do you believe?"	1
ClaimBuster	13527	It's a matter of being strong.	0
ClaimBuster	13528	That I can get something positive done on behalf of the people.	0
ClaimBuster	13529	I do not agree with Senator McCain that we're going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with countries like Russia and China that are, I think Senator McCain would agree, not democracies, but have extensive trade with Iran but potentially have an interest in making sure Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon.	0
ClaimBuster	13530	I'm more optimistic today than I was when I began about this nation providing we have the kind of leadership in Washington that can work with you, that can build partnerships, that can build jobs in every part of this country, not certain parts of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	13531	And recognizing that, I called together a group of our fellow citizens to study the issue.	1
ClaimBuster	13532	And so I think this is an issue.	0
ClaimBuster	13533	At the end of the first day, that little child wants out.	0
ClaimBuster	13534	And I really was moved, as well as impressed, by the speech that he gave to the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	13535	I have a proud record of working with both Republicans and Democrats, which is what our nation needs.	1
ClaimBuster	13536	And we would target it especially in areas that have been either depressed or which have lost a lot of defense related jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	13537	I've been proud to be president of the United States during these very troubled times.	0
ClaimBuster	13538	So, I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw: The leadership isn't taking us where we want to go.	0
ClaimBuster	13539	And that's grossly unfair to the average American who is paying his taxes and paying them on time and doesn't have any alternative: it's taken out of his paycheck.	0
ClaimBuster	13540	And I would think, it seems to me that there are opportunities here.	0
ClaimBuster	13541	My -- my view is that this president should have honored his promise to do as he said.	0
ClaimBuster	13542	I have relatives on Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	13543	As far as moving these people out and moving -- we either have a country or we don't.	0
ClaimBuster	13544	I've also suggested that there are weapons systems that we should proceed on, and I've outlined those in detail.	1
ClaimBuster	13545	You've got to let small businesses have more incentives.	0
ClaimBuster	13546	I also need -- the next leader needs to be patient.	0
ClaimBuster	13547	Let me reel some things off real quick, because you said you wanted specifics.	0
ClaimBuster	13548	And, so, I think that I'd leave it right there and say that you judge on the whole record.	0
ClaimBuster	13549	I think the uh - problem should've been addressed by increasing productivity, by having uh - put - put people back to work so they could purchase more goods, lower income taxes on individuals, perhaps raise them, if necessary, on corporations in comparison.	0
ClaimBuster	13550	That paid their mortgage payments?	0
ClaimBuster	13551	Let me say, that I found one thing in Governor Bush's answer that we certainly agree on, and that's the low income heating assistance program.	0
ClaimBuster	13552	"And he said to me and to the whole hall, he said, ""You know, don't take away my hope, because my hope is what keeps me going."""	1
ClaimBuster	13553	Forty-3 -- more than that -- states have it, I believe.	1
ClaimBuster	13554	In the Senate I was one of only ten Democrats, along with Senator Joe Lieberman, to support Governor Bush's dad in the Persian Gulf War Resolution.	1
ClaimBuster	13555	So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.	0
ClaimBuster	13556	But it also has to be tempered with our ability to beneficially affect the situation.	0
ClaimBuster	13557	And ironically, the single thing that has strengthened Iran over the last several years has been the war in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	13558	I used to sign welfare checks for my grandparents.	1
ClaimBuster	13559	I believe in the sanctity of marriage.	0
ClaimBuster	13560	It isn't a question of the number of people who are working in an Administration.	0
ClaimBuster	13561	That lesson tells us two things: One, pick a President that you know will know if that tragic moment ever comes what he must know, because there'll be no time for staffing committees or advisers.	0
ClaimBuster	13562	I had precisely in mind a lot of the people that were in the White House and other agencies who've never been had any experience, who came to Washington without any experience, they all were very liberal, of course, or they wouldn't be in the administration.	0
ClaimBuster	13563	And we also agree on the need for making sure that if we have bad teachers that they are swiftly -- after given an opportunity to prove themselves, if they can't hack it, then we need to move on because our kids have to have their best future.	0
ClaimBuster	13564	They understand that a free Afghanistan or a free Iraq will be a major defeat for them.	0
ClaimBuster	13565	It is the United States Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	13566	It isn't necessary to - to run America down in order to build her up.	0
ClaimBuster	13567	Middle class seniors like George McKinney and his wife are not covered for four to five years.	1
ClaimBuster	13568	They have an income of $25,000 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	13569	I'll call it the economy tax.	0
ClaimBuster	13570	They made sure their sons understood that this was the greatest country in the world, that those of us especially who were the sons and daughters of immigrants had a special responsibility to give something to the country that had opened up its arms to our parents and given so much to them.	0
ClaimBuster	13571	And that sends a confusing signal to people.	1
ClaimBuster	13572	This is a bad tax.	0
ClaimBuster	13573	And they are trying artificially extend the monopoly patent protection so they can keep charging these very high prices.	1
ClaimBuster	13574	Mr. Carter wants to increase taxes for roughly half of the taxpayers of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	13575	I don't know if that's exactly accurate or not.	0
ClaimBuster	13576	I mean, seriously -- labels don't mean anything.	0
ClaimBuster	13577	I will balance our budgets and I will get them and I will...	0
ClaimBuster	13578	But number two, because I recognized that if you're going to have women in the workforce that sometimes you need to be more flexible.	0
ClaimBuster	13579	I believe him when he says that he has a good heart.	0
ClaimBuster	13580	We will reduce the cost of a barrel of oil because we show the world that we have a supply of our own.	0
ClaimBuster	13581	Secondly, we're going to create a manufacturing jobs credit and a new jobs credit for people to be able to help hire and be more competitive here in America.	0
ClaimBuster	13582	And we almost had it done.	0
ClaimBuster	13583	We don't have any inspection.	1
ClaimBuster	13584	That's what debates are about and that's what campaigns are about.	0
ClaimBuster	13585	I don't believe that's in the American people's interest.	0
ClaimBuster	13586	She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign...	0
ClaimBuster	13587	I just don't think it's fair to tax people's assets twice regardless of your status.	0
ClaimBuster	13588	This year my state ranks first in the country in job growth, 4th in manufacturing in job growth, 4th in income growth, 4th in the decline of poverty.	1
ClaimBuster	13589	In uh - November of 1975 I met with the leaders of the five industrial nations in France for the purpose of seeing what we could do acting together to meet the problems of uh - the coming recession.	1
ClaimBuster	13590	So when you say it has no impact, it really did.	0
ClaimBuster	13591	And here's some help for you to go get an education.	0
ClaimBuster	13592	He's lost his most recent job and we've now just lost our home.	1
ClaimBuster	13593	So let's fix what's broken about it, but let's not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies.	0
ClaimBuster	13594	They now hold a trillion dollars' worth of our debt.	1
ClaimBuster	13595	Well, nobody's gotten into the real issue yet on the savings and loan again -- nobody's got a business background, I guess.	0
ClaimBuster	13596	That's exactly what Kim Jong Il wants.	0
ClaimBuster	13597	But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...	1
ClaimBuster	13598	"The terrorism czar, who has worked for every president since Ronald Reagan, said, ""Invading Iraq in response to 9/11 would be like Franklin Roosevelt invading Mexico in response to Pearl Harbor."""	1
ClaimBuster	13599	And thank you for your service to the country.	0
ClaimBuster	13600	We must let them know that the great American ideals - of independence, of the right of people to be free, and of the right to progress - that these are ideals that belong not to ourselves alone, but they belong to everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	13601	I think they're going to see through it.	0
ClaimBuster	13602	I see no evidence that it has done it.	0
ClaimBuster	13603	If he says that, this issue will not be discussed in the campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	13604	Mr. Landon ran in 1936 to repeal it.	1
ClaimBuster	13605	He talks about a smaller government.	1
ClaimBuster	13606	I haven't changed my mind: I'm going to fully fund it.	0
ClaimBuster	13607	They're not correct and if you look at my life, until I got involved in this effort, I was one person.	1
ClaimBuster	13608	I am going to carry this election debate all across this country in the last whatever remains of the last three and a half weeks, or whatever we have and the answer is no; I am not going to have any more debates, we don't need any more debates.	0
ClaimBuster	13609	I've also proposed a voluntary national test in the fourth grade and eighth grade, and a form of testing the governor has not endorsed.	1
ClaimBuster	13610	And I don't deserve that.	0
ClaimBuster	13611	I'm going to make sure --	0
ClaimBuster	13612	We could have bilateral talks with Kim Jong Il.	0
ClaimBuster	13613	I went to the Philippines as Vice President, pressed for human rights, called for the release of Aquino, and made progress that had been stalled on both the Subic and the Clark airfield bases.	1
ClaimBuster	13614	As a matter of fact, there are some pretty scientific and solid figures about how much space there still is in the world and how many more people we can have.	1
ClaimBuster	13615	Secondly, I think your plan -- a lot of fine print in your plan, Mr. Vice President, with all due respect.	0
ClaimBuster	13616	First of all, there is the historical perspective that I just described.	0
ClaimBuster	13617	I've been -- Ann was with someone just the other day that was just weeping about not being able to get work.	1
ClaimBuster	13618	He says he supports the President's position.	1
ClaimBuster	13619	I thought you'd forgotten I was here.	0
ClaimBuster	13620	That's what you have elections for.	0
ClaimBuster	13621	Well, I don't question his passion.	0
ClaimBuster	13622	We've got to turn this thing around.	0
ClaimBuster	13623	This is, with all due respect, Governor, that's a red herring.	0
ClaimBuster	13624	Well, Mr. Cater, of course it's a criticism that uh - is being made.	0
ClaimBuster	13625	...they would have gone through a...	0
ClaimBuster	13626	We raise the student loans.	0
ClaimBuster	13627	Stop some of this senseless litigation and let people work in America.	0
ClaimBuster	13628	These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price.	0
ClaimBuster	13629	One of the cornerstones of reform, and good reform, is to measure.	0
ClaimBuster	13630	But Governor Clinton's philosophy is isolate them.	0
ClaimBuster	13631	We tried to provide an appropriation of a billion and a half for five years, on a long-term loan basis, which this Administration opposed.	1
ClaimBuster	13632	But I do believe that we need to bolster our friends and allies.	0
ClaimBuster	13633	And I think that's the only answer.	0
ClaimBuster	13634	First of all, I think it's important to make voting more accessible.	0
ClaimBuster	13635	I think whoever is in the White House should just make it absolutely unconscionable and inexcusable, and if anybody's in the middle of a speech at, you know, one of these conventions, I would expect the candidate to go out and lift him off the stage if he starts preaching hate -- because we don't have time for it.	0
ClaimBuster	13636	He'll put liberal activists justices who will use their bench to subvert the legislature, that's what he'll do.	0
ClaimBuster	13637	How does it look in a program he called or some one of these marvelous Boston adjective up there and-about Angola-now, we have a chance-several Bostonians don't like it, but the rest of the country will understand.	0
ClaimBuster	13638	There were others who took a hike.	1
ClaimBuster	13639	I think it's been pretty impressive.	0
ClaimBuster	13640	Let me assure you that we made every possible overture to the People's Republic of China and through them to the Cambodian Government.	0
ClaimBuster	13641	I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth.	1
ClaimBuster	13642	Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand there is a connected between the two.	0
ClaimBuster	13643	That will -- that will reduce costs.	0
ClaimBuster	13644	The only thing I knew to do was to get aid as quickly as possible with state and federal help, and to put my arms around the man and his family and cry with them.	0
ClaimBuster	13645	When we are weak at home economically - high unemployment, high inflation, a confused government, a wasteful defense establishment, this encourages the kind of pressure that's been put on us successfully.	0
ClaimBuster	13646	I do not believe that someone who has supported Roe v. Wade that would be part of those qualifications.	0
ClaimBuster	13647	You've got one parent working for the government, the other parent working for the family.	0
ClaimBuster	13648	And every health care economist that looks at it says, over time, what'll happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse.	0
ClaimBuster	13649	They know that these toxic waste dumps should have been cleaned up a long time ago, and they know that people's lives and health are being risked, because we've had an administration that has been totally insensitive to the law and the demand for the protection of the environment.	1
ClaimBuster	13650	We saved an auto industry that was on the brink of collapse.	1
ClaimBuster	13651	And take a look at mine, also, and you'll see.	0
ClaimBuster	13652	Look, I -- I was on Navy ships that had nuclear power plants.	1
ClaimBuster	13653	You can keep what you have today, keep a high deductible, keep high premiums, keep a high co-pay, keep low benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	13654	Well, I think that trade is an important issue.	0
ClaimBuster	13655	Yes, I think we need more troops.	0
ClaimBuster	13656	Because I want to give new choices to parents.	0
ClaimBuster	13657	Russia and its republics are out of control or at best in weak control right now.	0
ClaimBuster	13658	... at a time when it's vitally important.	0
ClaimBuster	13659	We've gone from $10 trillion of national debt, to $16 trillion of national debt.	1
ClaimBuster	13660	She has been outsmarted by Putin.	0
ClaimBuster	13661	I've never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	13662	But the people who will be helped the most by it are the working people who will get the jobs created because of this tax.	0
ClaimBuster	13663	Actually it was a town hall, and I said I would cut taxes for middle- class families, and that's what I've done, by $3,600.00.	1
ClaimBuster	13664	What I support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	13665	And then, of course, with regards to standing for our principles, when -- when the students took to the streets in Tehran and the people there protested, the Green Revolution occurred, for the president to be silent I thought was an enormous mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	13666	And they were desperate for some way of getting coverage, because, understandably, they're worried that, if they get sick, they could go bankrupt.	1
ClaimBuster	13667	He promised you a tax cut in 1992, and if you got one, you ought to vote for him.	1
ClaimBuster	13668	The governor's plan is Social Security minus.	0
ClaimBuster	13669	Secondly, one of the things that we have to be careful about in politics is throwing money at a system that has not yet been reformed.	0
ClaimBuster	13670	My plan -- you can read my plan.	0
ClaimBuster	13671	In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to close it, but then the majority in the House of Representatives went the other way.	1
ClaimBuster	13672	Of course they all want to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	13673	So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones.	1
ClaimBuster	13674	So in principle, though, I'll take your point and think we ought to discuss child care or whatever else it is.	0
ClaimBuster	13675	Why can't Landale Shakespeare in Cleveland or Pilar Gonzales in Milwaukee give their children an opportunity to go to a better school.	0
ClaimBuster	13676	There are people all over the federal government, if they could just touch it with a screwdriver, could fix it.	0
ClaimBuster	13677	And I really want to just talk about something slightly different.	0
ClaimBuster	13678	I think we all do.	0
ClaimBuster	13679	Our dollar's at an all time low against some foreign currencies.	1
ClaimBuster	13680	That's really about all we can do.	0
ClaimBuster	13681	The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	13682	It is an issue that I am willing to take on, and so I'll bring Republicans and Democrats together.	0
ClaimBuster	13683	We have differences about how to achieve them.	0
ClaimBuster	13684	I also think that we should give visas to people -- green cards, rather, to people who graduate with skills that we need.	0
ClaimBuster	13685	Unfortunately, almost 300 brave young Marines were killed.	1
ClaimBuster	13686	An African American was my chief economic development officer.	1
ClaimBuster	13687	I think the greatest thing that ever happened to the South was the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the opening up of opportunities - uh to black people - the chance to vote, to hold a job, to buy a house, to go to school, and to participate in public affairs.	0
ClaimBuster	13688	And they figured out that between the tax cut that Governor Reagan is promising the American people, and the tax cut that Jimmy Carter is promising in 198I, his is worth about $122 more.	1
ClaimBuster	13689	I was opposed to the war but I loved my country and we need a president who will bring this country together, not divide it.	0
ClaimBuster	13690	So what we want to do is called opportunity scholarships.	0
ClaimBuster	13691	There's another part of the lopsided economy that we're in today, and that is that these heavy deficits have killed exports and are swamping the Nation with cheap imports.	0
ClaimBuster	13692	"Look, he has now said repeatedly, ""30 years this and 30 years that."""	1
ClaimBuster	13693	That's the kind of economy I want us to see again.	0
ClaimBuster	13694	If you look -- excuse me, Chris -- if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote -- millions, this isn't coming from me -- this is coming from Pew Report and other places -- millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote.	1
ClaimBuster	13695	But I finally did it.	1
ClaimBuster	13696	It at the John doesn't quite realize - he's never held an executive position of that kind.	1
ClaimBuster	13697	That's the way we're going to provide basic health security for all of the citizens of this country of ours.	0
ClaimBuster	13698	Because inside Pakistan, you have a -- a large group of Pashtun that are -- that are Taliban.	1
ClaimBuster	13699	I know the governor is against it, and I know that I'm for it.	0
ClaimBuster	13700	Government spending has gone completely out of control; $10 trillion dollar debt we're giving to our kids, a half-a-trillion dollars we owe China.	1
ClaimBuster	13701	We are energy rich, and coal is one of the great potentials we have.	1
ClaimBuster	13702	If we invest in job training, in child care for those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids don't lose their health benefits when she goes to work, we can help literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of families, to get off of welfare, to become independent and self-sufficient, to be taxpaying citizens, and to improve their lives, the quality of lives, their futures, and the futures of those children.	0
ClaimBuster	13703	It's almost become a way of life.	0
ClaimBuster	13704	But I think it ought to be one of our priorities to work with our European friends to convince them to put troops on the ground.	0
ClaimBuster	13705	And doesn't that prove the point, George, which is that values like family and education and community, decent homes for young people that family on Long Island I visited on Monday where Lou and Betty Tolamo (phonetic) bought a house for some $19,000 back in 1962, have had seven children, they're all making good livings.	1
ClaimBuster	13706	And I recognize I've made some decisions that have caused people to not understand the great values of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	13707	I think what grows the economy is when you get that tax credit that we put in place for your kids going to college.	0
ClaimBuster	13708	What I do is I close corporate loopholes, stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that we're giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	13709	It's one that we will solve and must solve, with a clean and wholesome environment and with a strong America that's strong militarily and economically as we must be, an America that provides strong international leadership because we're true to our values.	0
ClaimBuster	13710	So just to finish on the borders...	0
ClaimBuster	13711	He's been out in the state saying that, in Midwestern states.	1
ClaimBuster	13712	It doesn't help that person in their home if the next door neighbor's house is abandoned.	0
ClaimBuster	13713	I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said, we've got to change this strategy.	1
ClaimBuster	13714	I recognize there are some who just don't seem to care.	0
ClaimBuster	13715	We have a four percent gap between what we pay for treasuries, and what Germany pays for one to five year treasuries.	1
ClaimBuster	13716	And we would have lost a million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	13717	Uh - the lands that Mr. Ford uh - brags about having approved are in Alaska and they are enormous in uh - in size.	1
ClaimBuster	13718	That's exactly what our budget does, but it's driven by strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	13719	So her best help for short term is job retraining, if she was thrown out of work at a defense plant.	0
ClaimBuster	13720	And the reason I want middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes is because middle-income taxpayers have been buried over the past four years.	1
ClaimBuster	13721	It's one of the most consequential elections that we've had.	0
ClaimBuster	13722	That's a large part of your 17 percent increase in Medicare premiums.	1
ClaimBuster	13723	There are always trouble spots in the world, and how those troubled areas are addressed by a President alone in that Oval Office affects our nation directly, the involvement of the United States and also our American interests.	0
ClaimBuster	13724	It covers the majority of the work force.	0
ClaimBuster	13725	He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.	1
ClaimBuster	13726	And we need to promote maternity group homes, which my administration has done.	1
ClaimBuster	13727	Well, to say that the borders are not as protected as they were prior to September the 11th shows he doesn't know the borders.	0
ClaimBuster	13728	When Mr. Ford first became president in - in August of 1974, the first thing he did in - in October was to ask for a $4.7 billion increase in taxes on our people in the midst of the heaviest recession, since uh - since the great depression of nineteen uh - of the 1940s.	1
ClaimBuster	13729	They're aimed at the real problem.	0
ClaimBuster	13730	But we all know that we've still got a lot of work to do.	0
ClaimBuster	13731	He wants you to believe that I can't be president.	0
ClaimBuster	13732	No tax on your savings.	0
ClaimBuster	13733	Now, Governor Romney was a very successful investor.	1
ClaimBuster	13734	Growth is a little over 3 percent now.	1
ClaimBuster	13735	I want high wage, high skill jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	13736	Look, the revenue I get is by more people working, getting higher pay, paying more taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	13737	They don't even fight to reach those goals.	0
ClaimBuster	13738	I ask you to give me the opportunity to lead this great nation, so that we can be stronger here at home, respected again in the world, and have responsible leadership that we deserve.	0
ClaimBuster	13739	Russia is a country in transition.	0
ClaimBuster	13740	And I think, as a part of that process, what I am trying to say will come across, and that is that we must lead, we must command, we must direct, and a President must see it like it is.	0
ClaimBuster	13741	But just a few weeks ago, you said you think we should have more troops in Iraq right now.	1
ClaimBuster	13742	And so I've put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan.	1
ClaimBuster	13743	Those plans are better than this $550 billion tax scheme.	0
ClaimBuster	13744	We must deal with threats before they fully materialize.	0
ClaimBuster	13745	Governor Carter in November of 1975 indicated that he wanted to cut the defense budget by $15 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	13746	There has only been one prosecution under the Brady -- only one under the assault weapon ban and only seven under the Brady Bill that you talk about all the time.	1
ClaimBuster	13747	I think the United States can afford to do these things.	0
ClaimBuster	13748	Let me make it very clear that the bill that Mr. Nixon talked about did not mention Wilkes-Barre or Scranton; it did not mention West Virginia.	1
ClaimBuster	13749	I'm not proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	13750	Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts.	0
ClaimBuster	13751	I was Governor of Georgia for four years.	1
ClaimBuster	13752	We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	13753	It is not the kind of coalition we were described when we were talking about voting for this.	0
ClaimBuster	13754	And so I'm against price controls.	0
ClaimBuster	13755	So in those two cases I think uh - such uh - a constitutional amendment would be proper, and I really don't think in either case they're trivial matters.	0
ClaimBuster	13756	And yet let's just see what we've done for Poland, A half a billion dollars worth of aid has gone to Poland, primarily economic, primarily to go to the people of Poland.	1
ClaimBuster	13757	And I would say that no president should ever allow anybody else to make the major decisions, The president only makes the decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	13758	I do support a national patient's bill of rights.	0
ClaimBuster	13759	You're going to live in a peaceful world.	0
ClaimBuster	13760	Everybody told me they were cost-effective.	0
ClaimBuster	13761	I carry a little card in my pocket called the Tenth Amendment.	1
ClaimBuster	13762	Because the only type of agreements to reach with the Soviet Union are the types that are specifically defined, so we know exactly what they must do; subject to full verification, which means we know every day whether they're living up to it; and followups, wherever we find suggestions that they're violating it; and the strongest possible terms.	1
ClaimBuster	13763	It resulted also in an ability to reshape our court system, our prison system, our education system, our mental health programs and - and a clear assignment of responsibility and - and authority and also to have uh our people once again understanding control our government.	1
ClaimBuster	13764	America has not been standing still.	1
ClaimBuster	13765	He was on 60 Minutes just two weeks ago and he was asked: Is it fair for somebody like you, making $20 million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody making $50,000 year?	1
ClaimBuster	13766	Within the Administration, as a chairman of the President's Committee on Price Stability and Economic Growth, I have had the opportunity to make recommendations which have been adopted within the Administration and which I think have been reasonably effective.	1
ClaimBuster	13767	Now, ladies and gentlemen, important to understand, the president and his friends try to make a big deal out of it.	0
ClaimBuster	13768	I understand that the report today is accurate.	0
ClaimBuster	13769	We're being challenged like never before.	0
ClaimBuster	13770	We cut taxes 19 times and balanced our budget.	1
ClaimBuster	13771	Ann, both of them are very complicated situations.	0
ClaimBuster	13772	And that's one of the things that I hope I can lead personally as the President of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	13773	You can look all around and you'll see first-class strong women.	1
ClaimBuster	13774	I never criticized the U-2 flights in general, however.	1
ClaimBuster	13775	And I would suggest that Congress should hold such an investigation.	0
ClaimBuster	13776	Now, if there was a connection I think that there would be a different parallel between deficits getting larger and interest rates going down.	0
ClaimBuster	13777	That is a big project.	0
ClaimBuster	13778	I don't want to see the day when it's sixty percent of ours, and seventy and seventy-five and eighty and ninety percent of ours, with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	13779	Thanks for your questions tonight, very, very much.	0
ClaimBuster	13780	The federal government can be a part, but don't fall prey to all this stuff about money here and money there because education is really funded at the local level.	1
ClaimBuster	13781	I would say that the issue will stay with us as a campaign issue just as long as Senator Kennedy persists in what I think is a fundamental error.	0
ClaimBuster	13782	And there are other ways of squeezing this budget without constantly picking on our senior citizens and the most vulnerable in American life.	0
ClaimBuster	13783	And thanks to the people of San Diego for giving us this opportunity to have another discussion about the decision we all face in front of people who will make the decision.	0
ClaimBuster	13784	We're aligning facilities where the veterans live now.	1
ClaimBuster	13785	I started off with -- my dad was a small-business man.	1
ClaimBuster	13786	I have questioned his proposals.	0
ClaimBuster	13787	I'm grownup, I can deal with it, I'll pay my share.	0
ClaimBuster	13788	I know how to eliminate programs.	0
ClaimBuster	13789	Also the - the protection of an arrested person against unwarranted persecution in trying to get a false uh - confession.	0
ClaimBuster	13790	My opponent's right, we need good intelligence.	0
ClaimBuster	13791	The average family's income has gone up over $1600 just since our economic plan passed.	1
ClaimBuster	13792	I just don't think it's the role of the United States to walk into a country and say, Ã¢â‚¬Å“we do it this way, so should you.Ã¢â‚¬Â I think we can help.	0
ClaimBuster	13793	Mr. Ford has been there for eighteen months.	1
ClaimBuster	13794	We must have a transition plan to plan to convert from a defense to a domestic economy.	0
ClaimBuster	13795	And I think the press would follow that so closely that probably they would get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	13796	And today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the costs.	1
ClaimBuster	13797	They pulled out after Sergio de Mello got killed.	1
ClaimBuster	13798	But first we must have an aggressive jobs program.	0
ClaimBuster	13799	They are now raiding our troops in Afghanistan, destabilizing the situation.	1
ClaimBuster	13800	First of all, Senator Dole, let's set the record straight.	0
ClaimBuster	13801	Of course, we have to come together.	0
ClaimBuster	13802	In the first place I've never suggested that Cuba was lost except for the present.	1
ClaimBuster	13803	And that's because we've become weaker in each of those four...	0
ClaimBuster	13804	Yeah, I plead guilty to that.	0
ClaimBuster	13805	I don't think they should be allowed to.	0
ClaimBuster	13806	And then you need a philosophical -- I'd call it a philosophical underpinning.	0
ClaimBuster	13807	Well, again, I don't mean to go back and forth, but he...	0
ClaimBuster	13808	And Russia has now become a nation fueled by petro-dollars that is basically a KGB apparatchik-run government.	1
ClaimBuster	13809	And she's out campaigning along with our girls.	1
ClaimBuster	13810	There are sanctions in place on Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	13811	This is a company, this isn't basic research.	0
ClaimBuster	13812	You can't engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk.	0
ClaimBuster	13813	Provided support for some of these people, supported the nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	13814	But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate.	0
ClaimBuster	13815	Number three, we've got to deal with Pakistan, because Al Qaida and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, we've been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens.	1
ClaimBuster	13816	I'm proud of the fact that we hold people accountable.	0
ClaimBuster	13817	Well, obviously, my orientation is let's go do it.	0
ClaimBuster	13818	"To save for Halliburton the spoils of the war, they actually issued a memorandum from the Defense Department saying, ""If you weren't with us in the war, don't bother applying for any construction."""	1
ClaimBuster	13819	And you know what else I prepared for?	0
ClaimBuster	13820	And the tax relief was important to spur consumption and investment to get us out of this recession.	1
ClaimBuster	13821	But I think in all fairness and equity we have to recognize the problem that South Korea has.	0
ClaimBuster	13822	I'm trying to put a leash on them.	0
ClaimBuster	13823	This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important.	0
ClaimBuster	13824	Since I've been President, I've appointed, for instance, more than twice as many black Federal judges as all previous presidents in the history of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	13825	But it's not going to be easy.	0
ClaimBuster	13826	The Oregon plan is a good start if the federal government is going to continue to abandon its responsibilities.	0
ClaimBuster	13827	There is a man here in this audience named Hugo Berlanga.	1
ClaimBuster	13828	My mother basically raised our family.	1
ClaimBuster	13829	Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot.	1
ClaimBuster	13830	Surely we can fight off these laws that will encourage doctors to -- to allow doctors to take the lives of our seniors.	0
ClaimBuster	13831	One-time surge while we build factories and ship machine tools and equipment down there.	0
ClaimBuster	13832	I think it's intolerable that we have so many millions of children without any health insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	13833	I agree with my opponent that we shouldn't be committing troops.	0
ClaimBuster	13834	So I would take my responsibility seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	13835	And I think that's an important transition.	0
ClaimBuster	13836	So if you want to drill on public lands, you use it or you lose it.	0
ClaimBuster	13837	"The No Child Left Behind Act says, ""We'll raise standards."	1
ClaimBuster	13838	That's the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate.	0
ClaimBuster	13839	Is America better off than it was 4 years ago?	0
ClaimBuster	13840	This is an enormous boon for them.	0
ClaimBuster	13841	Then Exxon Mobil, which made $12 billion, record profits, over the last several quarters, they can afford to pay a little more so that ordinary families who are hurting out there -- they're trying to figure out how they're going to afford food, how they're going to save for their kids' college education, they need a break.	1
ClaimBuster	13842	I've been in Washington, D.C., three and a half years and led the Congress to reform Medicare so our seniors have got a modern health care system.	1
ClaimBuster	13843	Ours is a great land, and one of the reasons why is because we're free.	0
ClaimBuster	13844	And the result is interest costs that have never been seen before in terms of real charges, and it's attributable to the deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	13845	Now with respect to Libya, as I indicated in the last debate, when we received that phone call, I immediately made sure that, number one, that we did everything we could to secure those Americans who were still in harm's way; number two, that we would investigate exactly what happened, and number three, most importantly, that we would go after those who killed Americans and we would bring them to justice.	1
ClaimBuster	13846	There are extremists in all parts of the Middle East who want to kill that peace process.	1
ClaimBuster	13847	He's outsmarted her every step of the way.	0
ClaimBuster	13848	Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.	0
ClaimBuster	13849	As long as Vietnam, North Vietnam, does not give us a full and complete accounting of our missing in action, I will never uh - go along with the admission of Vietnam to the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	13850	They didn't get the tanks from this administration because we were nation building.	1
ClaimBuster	13851	Make up a number, $25,000, $50,000.	0
ClaimBuster	13852	Secondly, when we went in, there were three countries: Great Britain, Australia and the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	13853	We need to be stronger on terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	13854	It is hard work to go from a tyranny to a democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	13855	Well, why didn't she change it?	0
ClaimBuster	13856	If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for, $7 trillion -- just to give you a sense, over 10 years, that's more than our entire defense budget -- and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end up picking up the tab, then Governor Romney's plan may work for you.	1
ClaimBuster	13857	But if you feel that we have to move again in the sixties, that the function of the president is to set before the people the unfinished business of our society as Franklin Roosevelt did in the thirties, the agenda for our people - what we must do as a society to meet our needs in this country and protect our security and help the cause of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	13858	I doubt very much that Mr. Bush's selection for the Vice Presidency of the United States meets that test.	0
ClaimBuster	13859	I think you have to look at my record and you have to look at his.	0
ClaimBuster	13860	Well as you take the bills -	0
ClaimBuster	13861	But it's gotten too much.	0
ClaimBuster	13862	I would not wanna destroy the - the independence of the uh Federal Reserve - uh Board.	0
ClaimBuster	13863	That's why I fight for equality and justice.	0
ClaimBuster	13864	We have got to win our national strategy against drugs, the fight against drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	13865	We tend to be reactive.	0
ClaimBuster	13866	And the reason we did this is because a nuclear Iran is a threat to our national security, and it is a threat to Israel's national security.	0
ClaimBuster	13867	When he came, after giving a speech to the Congress, my opponent questioned his credibility.	1
ClaimBuster	13868	"And his answer was, ""With a viable exit strategy and only with enough forces to get the job done."""	1
ClaimBuster	13869	I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia.	0
ClaimBuster	13870	Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually.	1
ClaimBuster	13871	The United States is leading the free world out of the recession that was serious a year, year and a half ago.	1
ClaimBuster	13872	There was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade.	1
ClaimBuster	13873	I think the American people want it now.	0
ClaimBuster	13874	All these programs - and this cost on his - is - was - I saw an estimate, I'd love to know what he thinks, $35 - $40 billion - and it seems to me that somebody pays that.	0
ClaimBuster	13875	All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out.	1
ClaimBuster	13876	Maybe we can make a deal here tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	13877	Veterans are getting very good health care under my administration, and they will continue to do so during the next four years.	1
ClaimBuster	13878	We could speed it up.	0
ClaimBuster	13879	What tools do we need to fight us?	0
ClaimBuster	13880	The US should try to work with its allies and stop it.	0
ClaimBuster	13881	In each instance, our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	13882	Hillary wants to give amnesty.	1
ClaimBuster	13883	and that's where you begin.	0
ClaimBuster	13884	And all of you in the press know exactly what I'm talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	13885	I was in uh - a city in uh - Pennsylvania not too long ago, near here, and uh - there were about four or five thousand people in the audience - it was on a - on a train trip.	1
ClaimBuster	13886	I indicated that I would defend those islands if the attack were directed against Pescadores and Formosa, which is part of the Eisenhower policy.	1
ClaimBuster	13887	I'm very proud of him.	0
ClaimBuster	13888	Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic.	0
ClaimBuster	13889	This is -- this is a mindset.	0
ClaimBuster	13890	It's a very effective way of communication.	0
ClaimBuster	13891	And now the Soviet Union seems to be walking down that same path.	0
ClaimBuster	13892	Well, he was wrong then and he's wrong now.	0
ClaimBuster	13893	Now, we went into south Africa late, after Great Britain, Rhodesia, the black nations had been trying to solve this problem for many, many years.	1
ClaimBuster	13894	And in this instance the good intentions, of course, are a desire for peace.	0
ClaimBuster	13895	But I'm going to make an important point here, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	13896	Senator McCain and I disagreed recently when the Supreme Court made it more difficult for a woman named Lilly Ledbetter to press her claim for pay discrimination.	1
ClaimBuster	13897	It is because we are in the grip of a failed economic theory.	0
ClaimBuster	13898	But I think that the important point is we've got to have a president who understands the benefits of free trade but also is going to enforce unfair trade agreements and is going to stand up to other countries.	0
ClaimBuster	13899	Surely, there are things that we can do in the retrofitting, ;n the redesign of our homes, not only of our houses, but of our commercial structures, as well, that will make it possible for us to achieve.	0
ClaimBuster	13900	He said in Cincinnati we would plan carefully, we would take every precaution.	1
ClaimBuster	13901	I may have been misled by all the news reports about this matter, because the law that was proposed in Texas that had the support of the Byrd family and a whole lot of people in Texas did, in fact, die in committee.	1
ClaimBuster	13902	But, Andrea, I think we can go far beyond this as well, because we have opportunities now step-by-step to bring down the level of strategic weapons, get a test ban treaty, negotiate those conventional force reductions.	0
ClaimBuster	13903	And I'm for enforcing laws on the books.	0
ClaimBuster	13904	It's going to destabilize the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	13905	We need a strong, credible, effective nuclear deterrent.	0
ClaimBuster	13906	And the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military and so forth.	0
ClaimBuster	13907	And if we're not making investments in education and basic research, which is not something that the private sector is doing at a sufficient pace right now and has never done, then we will lose the (inaudible) in things like clean energy technology.	1
ClaimBuster	13908	And what's interesting is, it's a threat that has grown while the president has been preoccupied with Iraq, where there wasn't a threat.	0
ClaimBuster	13909	Not at all Because these are determined men.	0
ClaimBuster	13910	And motorists are using 8% less than they were back at that time of the oil embargo.	1
ClaimBuster	13911	You see our five kids, all over this country, and their spouses.	0
ClaimBuster	13912	And we also have planned a youth employment program which would encompass 600,000 jobs for young people.	1
ClaimBuster	13913	But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	13914	And it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking.	0
ClaimBuster	13915	It has some good provisions in it.	0
ClaimBuster	13916	I don't think this has worked in the past; I do not think it will work in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	13917	His own secretary of commerce had to be subpoenaed by the Congress to reveal the names of businesses who were subject to this boycott.	1
ClaimBuster	13918	Build a whole bunch of them, create millions of new jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	13919	I supported the V-chip so that parents would be able to control what their kids watch on television when they're young, along with the ratings systems for television and educational television.	1
ClaimBuster	13920	And if we'd used smart diplomacy, we could have saved $200 billion and an invasion of Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	13921	We have got to deal with long-term care.	0
ClaimBuster	13922	Then from World War I to World War II we had sort of a compulsory engagement policy.	1
ClaimBuster	13923	I promise it's less than 10 seconds.	0
ClaimBuster	13924	I vowed to our countrymen that I would do everything I could to protect the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	13925	But let's look at the overall record.	0
ClaimBuster	13926	Inflation is the quickest way to destroy jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	13927	We in this country can -- can compete successfully with anyone in the world, and we're going to.	0
ClaimBuster	13928	I think it's in the best interest of the United States, and the world as a whole that the United States negotiate rather than go back to the cold-war relationship with the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	13929	May I ask you a question?	0
ClaimBuster	13930	So I'd rather talk about my strengths.	0
ClaimBuster	13931	Governor Carter's answer tonight does not coincide with the answer that he gave in an interview to the Associated Press a week or so ago.	1
ClaimBuster	13932	And in the years to come it will be written that one or the other of us was elected and that he was or was not a great president.	0
ClaimBuster	13933	And thank God, the freeze people were not heard.	0
ClaimBuster	13934	Well first of all, I think Senator Kennedy should make up his mind with regard to my responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	13935	I'll restore the vitality that gets America working again.	0
ClaimBuster	13936	And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals.	0
ClaimBuster	13937	And I'll tell you one place that's working well, and that is the private sector -- Jim Burke and this task force that he has, you may know about it.	0
ClaimBuster	13938	Now, they claim they're not.	1
ClaimBuster	13939	I don't think we can be all things to all people in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	13940	The warning signs are clear.	0
ClaimBuster	13941	And he just called for new elections.	1
ClaimBuster	13942	Well, Mr. Greenberg, I simply cannot allow to go unpassed the statements that have just been made by Mr. Reagan, who once again, has demonstrated, I think, a total misunderstanding of the energy crisis that confronts, not only this country, but the world, when he suggests that we have 27 years' supply of natural gas, 47 years' supply of oil, and all the rest, and that we really.	0
ClaimBuster	13943	As a matter of fact, Iran is gonna get eighty F-14s before we even meet our own Air Force orders for F-l4s.	1
ClaimBuster	13944	We must rebuild America's strength at home.	0
ClaimBuster	13945	We need gas pipelines to bring the gas down.	0
ClaimBuster	13946	If there's a fairer way, I'm all ears (laughter) --aah.	0
ClaimBuster	13947	The warhead principle -- there have been counting rules for years.	0
ClaimBuster	13948	I can't give you a specific answer on Pension Guarantee Fund.	0
ClaimBuster	13949	We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are.	0
ClaimBuster	13950	all we have to do is to get the Government off the back of the oil industry, and that's going to be enough.	0
ClaimBuster	13951	But we've got to do even better.	0
ClaimBuster	13952	In our first debate he indicated that I had not had experience or at least uh - had not participated significantly in the making of the decisions.	1
ClaimBuster	13953	And there is ,so much trust has broken down in the aftermath of the change of government.	0
ClaimBuster	13954	I wouldn't be called a conservative if I were.	0
ClaimBuster	13955	Other members on that board were the presidents of the University of Illinois, the president of Northwestern University, who happens to be a Republican, the president of The Chicago Tribune, a Republican- leaning newspaper.	1
ClaimBuster	13956	We're all God's children, Bob.	0
ClaimBuster	13957	And this calls into question the president's whole policy in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	13958	No, I don't, and I'm not going to go to calling names on his facts.	0
ClaimBuster	13959	We differ on whether or not pollution controls ought to be voluntary.	1
ClaimBuster	13960	The safety net is there, and we're taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	13961	And that's why we've got a country with ten and a half million more jobs, and record numbers of new businesses, and rising incomes, and falling crime rates, and welfare roll rates.	1
ClaimBuster	13962	Let's look at the vote on Hungary.	0
ClaimBuster	13963	And then, through tax incentives, induce the creation of businesses providing jobs and so forth in those areas.	0
ClaimBuster	13964	I believe the role of the military is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	13965	A great historian, Henry Steele Commager, said that in their lust for victory, neither traditional party is looking beyond November.	1
ClaimBuster	13966	And as a matter of fact, the system that the administration is now talking about is very different from the one that was originally proposed in 1983.	1
ClaimBuster	13967	It also means it takes pressure off the border.	0
ClaimBuster	13968	There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective.	0
ClaimBuster	13969	In my tax reduction program for middle-income taxpayers, I recommended that the Congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars per person.	1
ClaimBuster	13970	In the second century of our nation's history, our forefathers developed the most productive industrial nation in the history of the globe.	0
ClaimBuster	13971	My opponent talks about me not signing certain treaties.	1
ClaimBuster	13972	Our neighbors here in America are vital to us.	0
ClaimBuster	13973	I think that we have to put more emphasis on early learning and pre-school.	0
ClaimBuster	13974	You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise.	0
ClaimBuster	13975	We're talking about failures on Main Street, and people who will lose their jobs, and their credits, and their homes, if we don't fix the greatest fiscal crisis, probably in -- certainly in our time, and I've been around a little while.	0
ClaimBuster	13976	And the cost in unemployment compensation, welfare compensation, and lost revenues has increased $23 billion in the last two years.	1
ClaimBuster	13977	My wife, Michelle, is there and she could give you a much longer list than I do.	1
ClaimBuster	13978	Now, see, we practice 19th century capitalism.	0
ClaimBuster	13979	The American people are healed, are working together.	0
ClaimBuster	13980	I want to get us on track to a balanced budget, and I'm going to reduce the tax burden on middle income families.	1
ClaimBuster	13981	Now, if you're a Red Sox fan, that's OK.	0
ClaimBuster	13982	I know what it takes to get this country back, and will work with good Democrats and good Republicans to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	13983	Somehow we've lost that accountability.	0
ClaimBuster	13984	We do it by getting -- by reducing spending in a whole series of programs.	0
ClaimBuster	13985	That's why it's important to make sure our alliances are as strong as they possibly can be to keep the pressure on Mr. Milosevic.	0
ClaimBuster	13986	And any research or development along the Star Wars schemes would inevitably involve our most advanced computers, our most advanced engineering.	0
ClaimBuster	13987	They appointed a commission I was on that commission.	1
ClaimBuster	13988	And we know what happened.	0
ClaimBuster	13989	First question is what's in the best interests of the United States?	0
ClaimBuster	13990	I said that we would put in place health care reform to make sure that insurance companies can't jerk you around and if you don't have health insurance, that you'd have a chance to get affordable insurance, and I have.	1
ClaimBuster	13991	Well, Mr. uh - Nelson, uh - I testified before two committees, House and Senate, on precisely the questions that you have asked.	1
ClaimBuster	13992	... $200 million is spent, and I'm either winning or tied, and I've spent practically nothing.	1
ClaimBuster	13993	You know, we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana.	1
ClaimBuster	13994	Well, Barbara, I believe that there is a fundamental difference - and I think it has been evident in most of the answers that Mr. Carter has given tonight - that he seeks the solution to anything as another opportunity for a Federal Government program.	0
ClaimBuster	13995	Mr. Ford hasn't moved on this.	1
ClaimBuster	13996	And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan.	1
ClaimBuster	13997	I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day.	1
ClaimBuster	13998	I want to make sure that the Iranians are put enough -- that we put enough pressure on the Iranians by joining with our allies, imposing significant, tough sanctions to modify their behavior.	0
ClaimBuster	13999	But I feel that at this point in our country's history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us.	0
ClaimBuster	14000	Uh - just a moment ago, for example, uh - he uh - was indicating that uh - uh - in the 1950s, for example, uh - unemployment was very low.	0
ClaimBuster	14001	That says something about character.	0
ClaimBuster	14002	But, let's start with Somalia, where they dragged Americans through the streets, and where 18 Americans were killed one day, because they didn't have, they were pinned down for eight hours, the rangers.	1
ClaimBuster	14003	And in 2006, our seniors will get prescription drug coverage.	0
ClaimBuster	14004	Would I understand it if it occurred to me, and I might just say I'm from a large family.	1
ClaimBuster	14005	I have been in the Congress for fourteen years.	1
ClaimBuster	14006	But I'd also like to point out that I haven't been part of what we're criticizing in Washington tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	14007	I'm going to make sure you get a job.	0
ClaimBuster	14008	There has to be revenue in addition to cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	14009	It's an issue I know a lot about.	0
ClaimBuster	14010	I would say I didn't hear what Yassir Arafat had to say, but I don't want to -- you know, I think foreign policy, I want to be very careful about, and I'm not here to argue about the President with some ongoing foreign policy matter.	0
ClaimBuster	14011	These interest rates we have now don't make any sense.	0
ClaimBuster	14012	But as far as special rights, I'm opposed to same-sex marriages, which the President signed well after midnight one morning in the dark of night.	1
ClaimBuster	14013	What I have said is that the president ought to have a chance to appoint a chairman of the Federal Reserve Board to have a coterminous uh term; in other words, both of 'em serve the same four - four years.	1
ClaimBuster	14014	I want to make sure the seniors have the promise made will be a promise kept, but I want younger workers to be able to manage some of their own money, some of their own payroll taxes in the private sector under certain guidelines to get a better rate of return on your own money.	0
ClaimBuster	14015	And let me tell you one specific pilot program where children who don't have a chance go to this program when they're 3.	0
ClaimBuster	14016	Family medical leave has let 12 million families take a little time off for the birth of a child or a family illness without losing their job.	1
ClaimBuster	14017	I trust people, I don't trust the federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	14018	Now, I think that's going back to where we started.	0
ClaimBuster	14019	And, unfortunately, he didn't go to war as a last resort.	1
ClaimBuster	14020	I don't think there's any question that the automobile executives made some errors in the 1980s, but I also think we should look at how much productivity has increased lately, how much labor has done to increase productivity and how much management has done.	0
ClaimBuster	14021	But we're going to have to have the courage and the sacrifice, the nerve to move in a new direction.	0
ClaimBuster	14022	We know what a treasure and joy it is to have an adopted child in our lives.	0
ClaimBuster	14023	Our laws against murder are State laws.	1
ClaimBuster	14024	$500 per child under 18.	1
ClaimBuster	14025	"And in the middle of the discussion, to tell them about the missiles in Cuba, he said, ""Here, let me show you the photos."""	1
ClaimBuster	14026	Someone who will not veto a bill that has an investment tax credit, middle class tax relief, research and development tax credits as Mr. Bush has done.	1
ClaimBuster	14027	I want to streamline the approval of the competing generic drugs and the new kinds of treatments that can compete with them so we bring the price down for everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	14028	And this is what we're trying to work out, not only to protect our own borders but to have some kind of fairness and recognition of that problem.	0
ClaimBuster	14029	But I have uh - an adequate background, I believe.	0
ClaimBuster	14030	I'm going to make sure that we get people off of food stamps, not by cutting the program, but by getting them good jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	14031	But the thing that is right about the United States, it should be emphasized, is that less people go to bed hungry in the United States than in any major country in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	14032	That raises, he says $800 billion; we say $600 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	14033	And it's up in some cases because both parents are working.	1
ClaimBuster	14034	For every new dollar that I propose for spending on health care, Governor Bush spends $3 for a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%.	1
ClaimBuster	14035	They don't want ISIS, but they have other things, because we're backing -- we're backing rebels.	1
ClaimBuster	14036	Well, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul.	1
ClaimBuster	14037	And I've had to fight a lot of people that were saying human rights, and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re the ones that put the sanctions on and stood for it.	1
ClaimBuster	14038	Unfortunately, he escaped in the mountains of Tora Bora.	1
ClaimBuster	14039	Now today the Secretary of State is in the Middle East and they've started negotiations and all those leaders promised me they would not quit until they resolved the issues between them and got the peace process going forward again.	1
ClaimBuster	14040	And as far as nuclear power is concerned, again, look at the record.	0
ClaimBuster	14041	It's just not credible to say he's going to keep taxes down and balance budgets.	0
ClaimBuster	14042	Iran is taking over Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	14043	He said he's for -- you're now for capping punitive damages?	0
ClaimBuster	14044	My objection here is not the cost in dollars.	0
ClaimBuster	14045	But in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put -- provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda.	0
ClaimBuster	14046	And so I made the decision we wouldn't spend any more money beyond the 70 lines, 22 of which are now in action, because science is important, but so is ethics, so is balancing life.	1
ClaimBuster	14047	When I came back from that war I saw that it was wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	14048	When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	14049	We can only be strong overseas if we're strong at home; and when I became president we'll not only be strong in those areas but also in defense - a defense capability second to none.	0
ClaimBuster	14050	I didn't always agree with their decisions, whether they were Democratic or Republican presidents.	1
ClaimBuster	14051	Making sure that we're bringing manufacturing back to our shores so that we're creating jobs here, as we've done with the auto industry, not rewarding companies that are shipping jobs overseas.	1
ClaimBuster	14052	His has been in the legislative branch.	1
ClaimBuster	14053	They don't want to raise the minimum wage.	0
ClaimBuster	14054	It was festooned with Christmas tree ornaments.	1
ClaimBuster	14055	Those Sandinistas came in and betrayed the trust of the revolution; they said it was about democracy, and they have done nothing other than solidify their Marxist domination over that country.	0
ClaimBuster	14056	I don't see how the Iraqis are going to have confidence in the American president if all they hear is that it was a mistake to be there in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	14057	I appreciate your listening tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	14058	They didn't tell you that that same year they increased spending $1.83 for every dollar we increased taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	14059	I want to make sure we keep our Pell grant program growing.	0
ClaimBuster	14060	And I also have to disagree on Senator McCain's record when it comes to college accessibility and affordability.	0
ClaimBuster	14061	Look, this is a funding crisis all around the country.	1
ClaimBuster	14062	They just decided the time for diplomacy is over and rushed to war without planning for what happens afterwards.	0
ClaimBuster	14063	What we need to do is empower people.	0
ClaimBuster	14064	And why hasn't she made the agreements better?	0
ClaimBuster	14065	But in the final analysis-in the final analysis, the person goes into that voting booth, they're going to say, Ã¢â€°Â¥Who has the values I believe in?	0
ClaimBuster	14066	I do believe that there's some fairly good news out there.	0
ClaimBuster	14067	That it was placed here to be found by a special kind of people - people who had a special love for freedom and who had the courage to uproot themselves and leave hearth and homeland, and came to what, in the beginning, was the most undeveloped wilderness possible.	0
ClaimBuster	14068	You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals.	0
ClaimBuster	14069	And getting back to this matter that we discussed at the outset, the matter of Quemoy and Matsu.	0
ClaimBuster	14070	I'm convinced that the result of this would be that people who are Hispanic, people who have different languages or speak with an accent, would find it difficult to be employed.	0
ClaimBuster	14071	She's raising your taxes really high.	0
ClaimBuster	14072	I believe strongly we should d- do so in Formosa and I believe we should meet our commitments to every country whose security we've guaranteed.	0
ClaimBuster	14073	But I would have used that force wisely, I would have used that authority wisely, not rushed to war without a plan to win the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	14074	Thank you Barbara (barely audible).	0
ClaimBuster	14075	My argument with him on -- the question was about the draft -- is that there's this same pattern.	0
ClaimBuster	14076	I hope the FDA took its time to make sure that American women will be safe who use this drug.	0
ClaimBuster	14077	I selected a man who stands with me in this field and who will talk with me and work with me on it.	0
ClaimBuster	14078	Well, I'll tell you exactly why not, but I first want to say something about those sanctions on Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	14079	This election is about two different visions about how we should go into the 21st Century.	0
ClaimBuster	14080	The second thing we need is to crack down on illegal hiring.	0
ClaimBuster	14081	And at his pace, it will take 13 years to secure those weapons in Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	14082	They have a variety of choices to choose, so should seniors.	1
ClaimBuster	14083	...you've had the floor for a while.	1
ClaimBuster	14084	What we are talking about is recognizing that the next president has to have a broader strategic vision about all the challenges that we face.	0
ClaimBuster	14085	The first thing is, everybody 25,000 and under would have no tax increase.	1
ClaimBuster	14086	In fact he is on Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	14087	But not by raising taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	14088	Many of the countries below that used to say, well, this is the US' problem -- if you'd get the demand down, then we wouldn't have the problem -- are working cooperatively with the DEA and the military.	1
ClaimBuster	14089	Well, my blood pressure is lower, my weight, my cholesterol, but I will not make health an issue in this campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	14090	And in the '60s, he wrote letter after letter to come to college here in the United States because the notion was that there was no other country on Earth where you could make it if you tried.	1
ClaimBuster	14091	We ought to be working with the African Union to do so -- precisely what we did in Liberia.	0
ClaimBuster	14092	And so we began a new dialogue with North Korea, one that included not only the United States, but now China.	1
ClaimBuster	14093	The border -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me.	1
ClaimBuster	14094	All they've got to show for 4 years in U.S.-Soviet relations is one meeting in the last weeks of an administration, and nothing before.	1
ClaimBuster	14095	I don't take it personally.	0
ClaimBuster	14096	What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time.	0
ClaimBuster	14097	Is the United States standing still?	0
ClaimBuster	14098	And then let's focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2,500 additional premium.	0
ClaimBuster	14099	I have worked in my state to reduce teen pregnancy and illness among children.	1
ClaimBuster	14100	I'll do everything I can as president to stop the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries.	0
ClaimBuster	14101	We're going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.	0
ClaimBuster	14102	First of all, I would quit conducting the decision-making process in secret, as has been a characteristic of Mr. Kissinger and Mr. Ford.	0
ClaimBuster	14103	First of all, let me say what we have done.	0
ClaimBuster	14104	It means that there will be a reduction in the uhh - unemployment.	0
ClaimBuster	14105	The reason I have opposed that initiative is because I'm afraid it will end those extra effort programs.	0
ClaimBuster	14106	Well, first of all, I think it's important for the American public to understand that the $750 billion rescue package, if it's structured properly, and, as president, I will make sure it's structured properly, means that ultimately taxpayers get their money back, and that's important to understand.	1
ClaimBuster	14107	They've appropriated about $200 million, but only spent about $3 million to get it underway.	1
ClaimBuster	14108	I think, too, that it should be pointed out that of course it is not possible, particularly under the proposals that Senator Kennedy has advocated, either to cut the national debt or to reduce taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	14109	Yes, we should make every effort to try to help those hostages come home, but it can never be because we make concessions.	0
ClaimBuster	14110	I met Grant Milliron, Mansfield, Ohio.	1
ClaimBuster	14111	Right now all the president is providing is humanitarian support.	1
ClaimBuster	14112	I think it's important for us to be training Columbians in that part of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	14113	I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.	0
ClaimBuster	14114	This is something that we can do; the Congress failed to do it, and we intend to do it.	1
ClaimBuster	14115	But if you look at public education alone and you take into account the fact that we have more racial diversity and more poverty, it makes a big difference.	1
ClaimBuster	14116	We can't I think adjust spending around to take care of the very much needed programs, including taking care of our veterans but I also want to say again a healthy economy with low taxes would not raising anyone's taxes is probably the best recipe for eventually having our economy recover.	0
ClaimBuster	14117	And I think the housing community is ready.	0
ClaimBuster	14118	In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health care system, which the vice president opposes, I think very unwisely.	1
ClaimBuster	14119	They don't want you to help them anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	14120	But -- but the right -- the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance of our people and states, not the federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	14121	It was a beautiful moment and I think she'll do a first-class job on that commission.	0
ClaimBuster	14122	Mr. Drummond, I am never satisfied with the economic growth of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	14123	I can't promise that I will never get another detail wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	14124	Asking the wealthy to pay a little bit more along with cuts so that we can invest in education like yours.	0
ClaimBuster	14125	The -- here are the facts.	0
ClaimBuster	14126	... the small businesses we're talking about...	0
ClaimBuster	14127	There is a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	14128	It needs to be competent.	0
ClaimBuster	14129	We're going to have to put in place a very comprehensive and robust strategy to help the -- the world of Islam and other parts of the world, reject this radical violent extremism, which is -- it's certainly not on the run.	0
ClaimBuster	14130	We've spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the hundred years of the Agricultural Department before that.	1
ClaimBuster	14131	First of all Ã‚ I want to make it clear, our military is the strongest, best-trained, best-equipped, best-led fighting force in the world and in the history of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	14132	Therefore, I think the question before the American people is: Are we doing as much as we can do?	0
ClaimBuster	14133	Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.	0
ClaimBuster	14134	Our government is that point now.	0
ClaimBuster	14135	You know, children listen to what is being said.	0
ClaimBuster	14136	It's time for government, industry, labor, manufacturing, agriculture, education, other entities in our society to cooperate.	0
ClaimBuster	14137	I want you to notice how the president switched away from jobs and started talking about education principally.	1
ClaimBuster	14138	We sign a peace treaty.	1
ClaimBuster	14139	And I've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.	1
ClaimBuster	14140	And I'm -- I'm -- understand why Senator Obama was surprised and said that the surge succeeded beyond his wildest expectations.	1
ClaimBuster	14141	Number one, we've got to get the debt down to get the interest rates down so the economy will grow and people will be employed.	0
ClaimBuster	14142	And it would also be very disturbing to our allies, all of whom support this nuclear arms treaty.	0
ClaimBuster	14143	There are now a large number of Afghan Security Forces, 350,000 that are ready to step in to provide security and we're going to be able to make that transition by the end of 2014.	1
ClaimBuster	14144	If we're saving money and depriving people of care, that's a bad thing.	0
ClaimBuster	14145	Apparently you can't pass any test under his vision of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	14146	This is a big issue.	0
ClaimBuster	14147	I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you.	1
ClaimBuster	14148	I guess the one thing that concerns me about this, Ann, is this attempt to label things which all of us believe in.	0
ClaimBuster	14149	Our military is assisting in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	14150	And if we can't, we're going to do it -- we're going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	14151	This keeps up with technology.	0
ClaimBuster	14152	So, the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the catastrophic program.	0
ClaimBuster	14153	So in other words, it's pretty divided during the 1990s as well.	1
ClaimBuster	14154	I said that the E-Verify portion of the Arizona law, which is -- which is the portion of the law which says that employers could be able to determine whether someone is here illegally or not illegally, that that was a model for the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	14155	We need to continue the negotiations to reduce the nuclear arsenals in the Soviet Union, the former Soviet Union, and the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	14156	Let's take your warhead principle.	0
ClaimBuster	14157	That's why they had to close down the subway in New York when the Republican Convention was there.	1
ClaimBuster	14158	I looked at the slowest growth in the century.	1
ClaimBuster	14159	I went my way because it was obvious we had a complete disagreement about what should be done with the company.	1
ClaimBuster	14160	Russia is new in terms of nuclear.	0
ClaimBuster	14161	On April 17 he said he'd bring out all the records on the draft.	1
ClaimBuster	14162	And it includes within it a number of provisions that I think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	14163	Now, I speak with some confidence of our plan, because I took over a state - California - 10% of the population of this nation - a state that, if it were a nation, would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	14164	Did we inflict any damage?	0
ClaimBuster	14165	But I disagree with them, as do many.	0
ClaimBuster	14166	But I also share your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters don't belong on our streets.	0
ClaimBuster	14167	And I was glad to hear him say that, because that's what we've been doing ever since I announced to the British Parliament that I thought we should do this.	1
ClaimBuster	14168	We've got an aggressive brown field program to refurbish inner-city sore spots to useful pieces of property.	1
ClaimBuster	14169	It's from $4000 to about $2000.	1
ClaimBuster	14170	This is a big spender.	1
ClaimBuster	14171	And the government doesn't create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	14172	Now, Jim, let me get it out.	0
ClaimBuster	14173	It still goes on, I would assume, on both sides.	0
ClaimBuster	14174	That's what the economists tell us.	1
ClaimBuster	14175	Just one last point I want to make, since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5,000 health credit.	1
ClaimBuster	14176	It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.	0
ClaimBuster	14177	But that is an extra $4 billion that would uh - add to the deficit which would add to the inflationary pressures, which would help to destroy jobs in the private sector - not make jobs, where the jobs really are.	1
ClaimBuster	14178	But I'm somebody who believes very strongly in taking care of the fundamentals first before you start new stuff.	0
ClaimBuster	14179	We've done it in Arkansas.	1
ClaimBuster	14180	And I think we have a powerful country.	0
ClaimBuster	14181	And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business.	0
ClaimBuster	14182	As a matter of fact, I think when Gallup ran their first poll in December of 1975 they didn't put my name on the list.	1
ClaimBuster	14183	Because I mean it when I say I want a kinder and gentler nation.	0
ClaimBuster	14184	But the dynamics of the economy - we cut the taxes and revenues are up by 25 percent in three years.	1
ClaimBuster	14185	I don't know if you have to be a paperwork filler-outer, but most of it's because of the federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	14186	Bob, I just need to comment on this.	0
ClaimBuster	14187	I know what it takes to get this economy going.	0
ClaimBuster	14188	The immediate problem we have is to stimulate our economy now so that we can get rid of unemployment.	0
ClaimBuster	14189	And I would also restore the involvement of the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	14190	I'm not going to continue trying to respond to these repetitions of the falsehoods that have already been stated here.	0
ClaimBuster	14191	Small businesses across America will have to cut jobs and will have their taxes increase and won't be able to hire because of Senator Obama's tax policies.	0
ClaimBuster	14192	I'm going to help the African-Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	14193	But where we're not making it is with the confirmed addicts.	0
ClaimBuster	14194	Now, what I've done throughout this campaign is to propose a net spending cut.	1
ClaimBuster	14195	And I ask you to give me the opportunity to make you proud.	0
ClaimBuster	14196	But we've got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work.	0
ClaimBuster	14197	In fact we've seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesn't think we need more teachers.	1
ClaimBuster	14198	What will be done to provide equality of education in all sections of the United States?	0
ClaimBuster	14199	And I can go on and on.	0
ClaimBuster	14200	I was over running records in west Texas, and I got a call from her, come home; went to the doctor; the doctor said, beautiful child, your child has a few weeks to live.	1
ClaimBuster	14201	So he's replaced by Mary Fisher who electrified the Republican Convention by talking about the compassion and the concern that we feel.	0
ClaimBuster	14202	Well, let me just make a couple of points.	0
ClaimBuster	14203	put that tax on here at home, reduce our consumption of that imported oil.	0
ClaimBuster	14204	They've got a lot of concerns.	0
ClaimBuster	14205	But anybody who suggests that that program would c- come to any figure indicated by the Vice President is in error.	0
ClaimBuster	14206	Nor has he indicated that he will support Title Three, which would give the Attorney General additional powers to protect Constitutional rights.	1
ClaimBuster	14207	In other words, you say to a youngster, it will be in your financial interest to start saving for future illness, but for the working folks that do want to have health care that can't afford it, a couple of things we need to do.	0
ClaimBuster	14208	Well, I guess I'm reminded a little bit of what Will Rogers once said about Hoover.	0
ClaimBuster	14209	Well, I think we're getting better all the time.	0
ClaimBuster	14210	And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them.	0
ClaimBuster	14211	Have you seen what's happening to Aleppo?	0
ClaimBuster	14212	When I came into office, the world was divided.	0
ClaimBuster	14213	He goes out and says the man is questioning my patriotism.	0
ClaimBuster	14214	He hasn't done that either.	1
ClaimBuster	14215	Let me give you a prime example.	0
ClaimBuster	14216	And, therefore, I don't feel -- and my minister knows this and supports me in this position -- I don't feel that I have a right to go to church, knowing that my being there could cause something of the kind that we have seen in other places, in Beirut, for example.	0
ClaimBuster	14217	We have to work on a collaborative basis, not because we're going to compromise our principle, but because there's common ground.	0
ClaimBuster	14218	And the proof is our oil imports are down to the lowest levels in 20 years.	1
ClaimBuster	14219	It was a moment ago and I didn't get a chance to, when he was describing Chinese investments and so forth.	0
ClaimBuster	14220	I want to begin by saying again how much I respect Senator Dole and his record of public service and how hard I will try to make this campaign and this debate one of ideas, not insults.	0
ClaimBuster	14221	This was last August, a year ago.	1
ClaimBuster	14222	Look, if Ross were right when we get a free trade agreement with Mexico, why wouldn't they have gone down there now?	0
ClaimBuster	14223	And we are now reletting them so that we can actually make a profit.	1
ClaimBuster	14224	So you can't blame the practitioners for the health problem.	0
ClaimBuster	14225	But you can't just do it by cutting Medicare; you have to take on the insurance companies, the bureaucracies.	0
ClaimBuster	14226	I want a country where people who work hard and play by the rules are rewarded, not punished.	0
ClaimBuster	14227	Well, you know, Senator McCain, in the last debate and today, again, suggested that I don't understand.	1
ClaimBuster	14228	And we have a Fed that's doing political things.	0
ClaimBuster	14229	I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem.	0
ClaimBuster	14230	Think about it: They're going from tyranny to elections.	0
ClaimBuster	14231	And I'm really glad that the premiums have started -- at least the people see what's happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can't get any worse.	1
ClaimBuster	14232	And Senator Obama is parsing words when he says precondition means preparation.	0
ClaimBuster	14233	We've allocated $7 billion over the next months for reconstruction efforts.	1
ClaimBuster	14234	"And suddenly somebody says, ""Oh, it's got to be up there, and it's Star Wars,'' and so forth."	1
ClaimBuster	14235	The voluntary national testing is in addition to the mandatory testing that we require of states.	1
ClaimBuster	14236	And I have said freely, all over this country, that it was a mistake for me or anyone to ever try to put the Judeo-Christian heritage of this country, important as it is, and important as my religious faith is to me - it's a very deeply personal matter.	1
ClaimBuster	14237	I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing.	1
ClaimBuster	14238	I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.	0
ClaimBuster	14239	Well, let me tell you straight up: I've never changed my mind about Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	14240	I worked to get $400 million just a couple of weeks ago.	1
ClaimBuster	14241	I'll take a few days off and hold hands with you and get this airlines thing straightened, because that's important to this country.	0
ClaimBuster	14242	We have seen premature births that are now grown-up, happy people going around.	1
ClaimBuster	14243	But she works for me.	1
ClaimBuster	14244	See, divided teams lose; united teams win.	0
ClaimBuster	14245	Earlier, Governor Romney talked about he wants to make Pell Grants and other education accessible for young people.	1
ClaimBuster	14246	The last thing we need to do is to go back to the very same policies that got us there.	0
ClaimBuster	14247	"Join us for a war that is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time?"""	0
ClaimBuster	14248	I saw them work, I saw them make very hard decisions.	1
ClaimBuster	14249	Let's -- let's pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures they've -- they've engaged in.	0
ClaimBuster	14250	I want to develop the coal resources in America.	0
ClaimBuster	14251	We need to put one person in charge of the battle against AIDS to cut across all the agencies that deal with it.	0
ClaimBuster	14252	And that's what we need, I think, in this election.	0
ClaimBuster	14253	And even when it finally got near passage, Senator Kennedy held it up for 100 days, because he wasn't satisfied with one provision.	1
ClaimBuster	14254	But what I've also said is let's hire another 100,000 math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed.	1
ClaimBuster	14255	I'm well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.	1
ClaimBuster	14256	But she does fight hard, and she doesn't quit, and she doesn't give up.	0
ClaimBuster	14257	Number one, if I get there, it will be a very unusual and historical event --	0
ClaimBuster	14258	We provide the leadership and we're going to have to continue to provide the leadership, but let's do it on our terms when our interests are involved and not when somebody blows the whistle at the United Nations.	0
ClaimBuster	14259	Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	14260	She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there.	0
ClaimBuster	14261	The American middle-class family isn't making it right now, Bob.	0
ClaimBuster	14262	You didn't hear what I said.	0
ClaimBuster	14263	All over the world, people are being torn apart -- Bosnia, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Rwanda, Burundi -- you name it -- because of all their differences.	0
ClaimBuster	14264	The last point is that the major - uh thrust has gotta be to put people back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	14265	Governor Reagan and his new Republican Party have departed from this commitment - a very severe blow to the opportunity for women to finally correct discrimination under which they have suffered.	0
ClaimBuster	14266	so I think we will wait, see what they present, take a look at it.	0
ClaimBuster	14267	But when you were a candidate in 2008, as I was, and I said if I got bin Laden in our sights I would take that shot, you said we shouldn't move heaven and earth to get one man.	1
ClaimBuster	14268	The goal is for every single child to learn to Read.	0
ClaimBuster	14269	-- this was a spontaneous --	0
ClaimBuster	14270	Well, Anne, let me just say before I answer your question that I didn't know that the Vice President attacked our program in Massachusetts.	1
ClaimBuster	14271	Social Security is a trust fund that pays the checks this year with the money that is paid into Social Security this year.	1
ClaimBuster	14272	I think it's a disgrace.	0
ClaimBuster	14273	There are we certainly ought to be able to	0
ClaimBuster	14274	Programs like Project Exile where the federal government intensifies arresting people who illegally use guns.	1
ClaimBuster	14275	The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh - surpluses - nine billion dollars worth.	1
ClaimBuster	14276	I hope that before we do meet, there will be preliminary agreements on those four questions, or at least two of them, or even one of them, which would warrant such a meeting.	0
ClaimBuster	14277	We right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system.	1
ClaimBuster	14278	You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	14279	One of the reasons -- or one of the ways they don't play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency.	1
ClaimBuster	14280	This is a man whose plan excludes 50 million Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	14281	And we have got to again lead by example and help these other countries that are trying to straighten out their situations find the tools in order to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	14282	I'm concerned about the fact that so many of our securities are in the hands of foreign banks because of these massive deficits.	1
ClaimBuster	14283	We have uh - in this last uh two years alone a hundred and twenty billion dollars total deficits under President Ford and uh - at the same time we've had, in the last eight years, a doubling in the number of bankruptcies for small business: we've had a negative growth in our - in our national economy measured in real dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	14284	We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won't take more Medicare patients.	1
ClaimBuster	14285	So, I'm all for pipelines.	0
ClaimBuster	14286	My hope is that the African Union moves rapidly to help save lives.	0
ClaimBuster	14287	And I might add that uh - my administration - and I'm very proud of it - is the first administration that has taken an antitrust action against companies in this country that have allegedly cooperated with the Arab boycott.	1
ClaimBuster	14288	When it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	14289	I happen to think she's a key person.	0
ClaimBuster	14290	"And a recent book that just came out by perhaps the Nation's most respected author in this field, Strobe Talbott, called ""Deadly Gambits,'' concludes that this President has failed to master the essential details needed to command and lead us, both in terms of security and terms of arms control."	1
ClaimBuster	14291	If the majority of the members of the Congress felt that these particular proposals were good issues - the majority of those who were Democrats - why didn't they pass them and send to the President and get a veto and have an issue?	0
ClaimBuster	14292	So that is why I advocate a program of tax reform which will stimulate more investment in our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	14293	Absolutely, and I proposed over a hundred billion dollars in cuts in Federal spending over 4 years, but I am not going to cut it out of Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and things -- [applause] -- that people need.	1
ClaimBuster	14294	One of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family and for those children is the threat that they mat lose their health insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	14295	The reason Medicare and Medicaid are a mess is we froze them.	1
ClaimBuster	14296	I know the oil companies have been itching to do that, but it is not the right thing for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	14297	And third, credible: Ladies and gentlemen, in 1985, I was one of the first Democrats to move to balance the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	14298	The other thing is, we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth.	0
ClaimBuster	14299	So, I don't think vouchers are the right way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	14300	And I actually believe that we need missile defense, because of Iran and North Korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons, but I also believe that, when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation, then we're making a mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	14301	I don't think he would be listening to you very much anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	14302	You don't want to politicize drugs, but it's already politicized Medicare, go out and scare senior citizens and other vulnerable groups, veterans and people who get Pell Grants and things like this.	0
ClaimBuster	14303	It has to be helped, has to be fixed.	0
ClaimBuster	14304	Our country has been very active with regular conversations with the leaders there.	1
ClaimBuster	14305	Could be wrong, but I think so.	0
ClaimBuster	14306	Now let's pass the tax cuts for education and child rearing, help with medical emergencies, and buying a home.	0
ClaimBuster	14307	That's the net of what's happened in the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	14308	But there are two main focal points of this election.	0
ClaimBuster	14309	Now, the priorities are just very different.	0
ClaimBuster	14310	We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again.	0
ClaimBuster	14311	And it's not just looking to our words that you have to take in evidence of where they go.	0
ClaimBuster	14312	He said he was going to lower tax rates.	1
ClaimBuster	14313	I am talking of taking the treaty back, and going back into negotiations.	0
ClaimBuster	14314	Anybody who says that the inflation rate is in good shape now ought to talk to the housewives.	0
ClaimBuster	14315	He believes in deregulation in every circumstance.	1
ClaimBuster	14316	The fact is, the take-home pay of a typical American family as a share of national income is lower than it's been since 1929.	1
ClaimBuster	14317	Mr. President, let me finish.	0
ClaimBuster	14318	We took the Senate report, of course.	1
ClaimBuster	14319	If you're a company in St. Louis working, trying to make jobs here, there is actually an incentive for you to go away.	0
ClaimBuster	14320	I think it depends on what we do.	0
ClaimBuster	14321	And what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he's never apologized for.	1
ClaimBuster	14322	I have fought for Social Security and Medicare and for things to help people who are vulnerable all my life, and I will do it as President of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	14323	I hope they'll think it's good that democracy and freedom is on the move.	0
ClaimBuster	14324	We now have uh - a greatly expanded White House staff.	1
ClaimBuster	14325	What I would propose, and I proposed it way back in March when I was a candidate in my own state of Illinois, I proposed $11.3 billion, specifically, in cuts in the Federal budget.	1
ClaimBuster	14326	Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.	0
ClaimBuster	14327	There are different ideas -- the Bush plan, the Perot plan, the Clinton -- we have different ideas.	0
ClaimBuster	14328	But more importantly, let the people in our own country realize that we still live in the greatest nation on earth.	0
ClaimBuster	14329	I don't think we can wait until the next president is inaugurated and then uh - select a new team and then all the months of negotiating that will take place before we reach a decision, I think that immediately after this election we should set a timetable - the next president, working with the present President, President Eisenhower - a timetable to break the Soviet filibuster.	0
ClaimBuster	14330	This is about getting jobs for the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	14331	And I think we're all together on that.	0
ClaimBuster	14332	Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger.	0
ClaimBuster	14333	Saddam Hussein would have been continually weakening.	0
ClaimBuster	14334	The worst thing that I can think can happen in this campaign would be for it to be decided on religious issues.	0
ClaimBuster	14335	I think everybody understands at this point that we are experiencing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	14336	I don't think we agree on that.	0
ClaimBuster	14337	Before I decided to run, I had to resolve two issues in my mind.	0
ClaimBuster	14338	That's not the kind of advocacy that women need.	0
ClaimBuster	14339	My opponent just this weekend talked about how terrorism could be reduced to a nuisance, comparing it to prostitution, illegal gambling.	1
ClaimBuster	14340	And I can assure you that if I'm elected president we will do so.	0
ClaimBuster	14341	And what I'm about to say is unclassified.	0
ClaimBuster	14342	So we need to have fixed-cost contracts.	0
ClaimBuster	14343	I've been heavily criticized because I called for the resignation of the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.	1
ClaimBuster	14344	Is that the kind of leadership we need?	0
ClaimBuster	14345	Jim, let me tell you exactly what I'll do.	0
ClaimBuster	14346	Governor Romney, here's what we did.	0
ClaimBuster	14347	We're going to reform our intelligence services to make sure that we get the best intelligence possible.	0
ClaimBuster	14348	As a matter of fact in his book, The Strategy for Peace, he took the right position.	0
ClaimBuster	14349	The time for campaign funding reform is after the election.	0
ClaimBuster	14350	And from the a- analysis that I've made so far, it seems to me that that tax bill does uh - justify my signature and my approval.	0
ClaimBuster	14351	Social Security is stable until, as you pointed out, at least the third decade of the next century.	1
ClaimBuster	14352	I just -- I think that racial profiling is a serious problem.	0
ClaimBuster	14353	You have to make choices.	0
ClaimBuster	14354	They learn to think well or poorly of themselves in the first 18 months.	1
ClaimBuster	14355	But to the extent that we continue to use atomic power, I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained.	0
ClaimBuster	14356	We want a peaceful planet.	0
ClaimBuster	14357	And yet last year we gave them less than five percent of all the technical assistance funds that we distributed around the world.	1
ClaimBuster	14358	I don't think we want to get to how he's going to pay for all these promises.	0
ClaimBuster	14359	I know how to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	14360	But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas I'll just note.	0
ClaimBuster	14361	It's a tax cut, cutting capital gains 50 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	14362	We don't have an alternative.	0
ClaimBuster	14363	Making sure that we've got the best education system in the world, including retraining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow.	0
ClaimBuster	14364	No, I wouldn't do away with all - uh business deductions.	0
ClaimBuster	14365	But here's something that we can take great pride in because it really does get to what you're talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	14366	When I opposed Medicare, there was another piece of legislation meeting the same problem before the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	14367	He has no respect for her.	0
ClaimBuster	14368	That's exactly where the tax cuts went.	1
ClaimBuster	14369	By the way, my friends, I know you grow a little weary with this back-and-forth.	0
ClaimBuster	14370	Well, I must say, I look back at the vote on Medicare in 1965, we had a program called Eldercare that also provided drugs and means tests to people who needed medical attention received it.	1
ClaimBuster	14371	It's called make America great again.	0
ClaimBuster	14372	"Call me, let me know."""	0
ClaimBuster	14373	Well, Milosevic has lost the election.	1
ClaimBuster	14374	In addition to what you mentioned, they also were concerned about this all-powerful central government in Washington, D.C., that'd in effect confiscate your property, so -- I carry it in my pocket -- I can't pull it out or I'd violate the rules -- a copy of the Tenth Amendment which says we ought to return power to the states and the people, the people here.	0
ClaimBuster	14375	But the main thing is he still didn't get it, from what he said the other night to that fine woman on our program, the 209 people in Richmond.	0
ClaimBuster	14376	Because economic growth means strength and vitality; it means we're able to sustain our defenses; it means we're able to meet our commitments abroad.	0
ClaimBuster	14377	But I've always tried in whatever I've done is to bring people together.	0
ClaimBuster	14378	You've gone up, in Missouri, about $3,500.	1
ClaimBuster	14379	And, Senator McCain, he says -- he talks about Arizona.	1
ClaimBuster	14380	And you should go down and take a look at that.	0
ClaimBuster	14381	Margaret, I'm not sure I can get all of this in in one minute.	0
ClaimBuster	14382	I don't blame him, because in 1975 we had fewer housing starts in this country, fewer homes built, than any year since 1940.	1
ClaimBuster	14383	The fact is that he did not choose to go to war as a last result.	1
ClaimBuster	14384	I would ask for your vote, and I promise you that if you give me the extraordinary honor of serving as your president, I will work every single day, tirelessly, on your behalf and on the behalf of the future of our children.	0
ClaimBuster	14385	I think that we're out in front of most -- and I see that the red light is blinking, so I can't continue.	0
ClaimBuster	14386	One reason is, you know, the third biggest spending item in our budget is interest on the national debt?	1
ClaimBuster	14387	And Ross properly says, okay, there's some pain in that.	0
ClaimBuster	14388	Our policy was not to cut subsidies.	0
ClaimBuster	14389	She's given money back to the taxpayers.	1
ClaimBuster	14390	Let's look at the position.	0
ClaimBuster	14391	And, of course, Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon, we've got real (inaudible).	1
ClaimBuster	14392	Net farm income is off 50 percent in the last 3 years, and every farmer knows it.	1
ClaimBuster	14393	You'll be in a world in which fits into my philosophy.	0
ClaimBuster	14394	I'm interested in working with our nations and do a lot of it.	0
ClaimBuster	14395	I would be a president for all of the people, African- Americans, the inner cities.	0
ClaimBuster	14396	And Senator Obama, it's good to be with you at a town hall meeting.	0
ClaimBuster	14397	As I said at the beginning, the question before us all, that faces all Republicans and all Democrats, is: can freedom in the next generation conquer, or are the Communists going to be successful?	0
ClaimBuster	14398	The contracts need to be smaller, the agencies need to be -- need to recruit and to work hard to find people to bid on the state contracts.	0
ClaimBuster	14399	There are some advantages to experience, and knowledge, and judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	14400	I think -- in the last few years I think have been unfortunate.	0
ClaimBuster	14401	I make no bones about it.	0
ClaimBuster	14402	But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades.	0
ClaimBuster	14403	Now, just because we cannot be involved everywhere, and shouldn't be, doesn't mean that we should shy away from going in anywhere.	0
ClaimBuster	14404	And we just have to take it day-to-day right now.	0
ClaimBuster	14405	We want there to be electronic medical records to cut down on error, as well as reduce cost.	0
ClaimBuster	14406	I don't really think it's any of my -- you know, any of my concerns what -- how you conduct your sex life.	0
ClaimBuster	14407	Including the parents in the preschool education of their kids, even if they're poor and uneducated, can make a huge difference.	0
ClaimBuster	14408	I expect those new energy sources to be built right here in the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	14409	And we have this arms race underway.	0
ClaimBuster	14410	I talked about it earlier when I talked about the works and faith without works being dead.	1
ClaimBuster	14411	Through our Race to the Top program, we've worked with Republican and Democratic governors to initiate major reforms, and they're having an impact right now.	1
ClaimBuster	14412	I strongly support term limits for members of the US Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	14413	So that's why I hope that we will come together in this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	14414	I do not for a moment think I'm entitled to all the credit for all the good things that have happened in America.	0
ClaimBuster	14415	That's not what I have.	0
ClaimBuster	14416	He's a vice presidential nominee who represents -- I think people got to see why I picked him.	0
ClaimBuster	14417	... million new jobs, a balanced budget...	0
ClaimBuster	14418	This isn't going to blow a hole in the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	14419	The European Community is in a position to pay a lot more than they have in the past.	1
ClaimBuster	14420	When the Asian financial crisis raised the risk of world-wide recession that could affect our economy, And now, of course, the euro's value has been dropping, but seems to be under control.	1
ClaimBuster	14421	I'm going to be respectful for people who may disagree with me.	0
ClaimBuster	14422	But it is -- the basic structure is sound.	0
ClaimBuster	14423	Our plan will balance the budget, grow the economy, preserve the environment, and invest in education.	0
ClaimBuster	14424	If you don't have health insurance, then what we're going to do is to provide you the option of buying into the same kind of federal pool that both Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees, which will give you high-quality care, choice of doctors, at lower costs, because so many people are part of this insured group.	0
ClaimBuster	14425	So we're going to have to tell the American people that spending is going to have to be cut in America.	0
ClaimBuster	14426	I'm confident that it can be done and that it will reduce inflation because I did it in California.	1
ClaimBuster	14427	I have given every bit of evidence, answered every question that's as- been asked me by any senator or any member of the House.	1
ClaimBuster	14428	Thank you, Mr. President, for those kind words.	0
ClaimBuster	14429	And we can get those weapons at the same time as we get China.	0
ClaimBuster	14430	We can't coddle, as we did, a dictator, give him billions of dollars and then he's making peace treaties with the Taliban and militants.	1
ClaimBuster	14431	And if we fail, the cause of freedom fails.	0
ClaimBuster	14432	What's at issue here is the President's application of his authority to understand what a President must know to lead this nation, secure our defense, and make the decisions and the judgments that are necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	14433	But very specifically the key thing is to turn the government back to the people and take it away from the special interests and have people go to Washington to serve.	0
ClaimBuster	14434	That's why in this whole area of civil rights, the equality of opportunity for employment and education is not just for the benefit of the minority groups, it's for the benefit of the nation so that we can get the scientists and the engineers and all the rest that we need.	0
ClaimBuster	14435	Their oil production has plunged to the lowest level since they were fighting a war with Iraq 20 years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	14436	If you take a patient into the hospital that's bleeding arterially, step one is to stop the bleeding.	0
ClaimBuster	14437	More money is needed and I spend more money, but step one is to make sure we reform the system to have the system in place that leaves no child behind.	0
ClaimBuster	14438	My plan has not only a short-term component, but also a long-term component.	1
ClaimBuster	14439	I don't think we should give up on the private schools and leave kids trapped in failing schools.	0
ClaimBuster	14440	That's what we caught him doing.	1
ClaimBuster	14441	Not all this back and forth, you voted this way, you voted that way, we want a better America as we go into the next century.	0
ClaimBuster	14442	The Soviet Union in 1955 expressed regrets to us over the Bering Sea incident.	1
ClaimBuster	14443	My plan was to have the company go through bankruptcy like 7-Eleven did and Macy's and Condell (ph) Airlines and come out stronger.	1
ClaimBuster	14444	We are exporting more coal this year than any year in history.	1
ClaimBuster	14445	So I will keep on as president trying to get a successful conclusion to the GATT Round, the big Uruguay Round of trade which will really open up markets for our agriculture particularly.	0
ClaimBuster	14446	China and India were exempted from that treaty.	1
ClaimBuster	14447	We have to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't like us very much.	0
ClaimBuster	14448	That we must, in the failure to be able to protect our national security as it is today, we must not be provocative to any possible adversary.	0
ClaimBuster	14449	I will keep America strong and get America's middle class working again.	0
ClaimBuster	14450	I've done a lot of things that were controversial.	1
ClaimBuster	14451	We'll produce more coal this year than any year in history.	1
ClaimBuster	14452	That's what we need more of, and that's what I've done in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	14453	We lost a lot of manufacturing jobs in the 12 years before I became President.	1
ClaimBuster	14454	The position of the United States has been that this build-up, in the words of the president, has been foolish.	0
ClaimBuster	14455	He said that by now we'd have unemployment at 5.4 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	14456	We have to guard our energy companies.	0
ClaimBuster	14457	I don't think there's any doubt that, in the future, the cost of oil is going to go up.	0
ClaimBuster	14458	And a month or so ago I did uh - likewise say over the next ten years we should expand - double - this national parks, the wild wilderness areas, the scenic river areas.	1
ClaimBuster	14459	But the federal spending for education is up, and I want to be the education president, because I want to see us do better.	1
ClaimBuster	14460	Now, when you out-spend Congress you're really swinging.	0
ClaimBuster	14461	When I was in the senate before I became vice president I was pushing for stronger action against Milosevic.	1
ClaimBuster	14462	I have no loans from Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	14463	And I think it's the consensus of the people who are knowledgeable in the military field, that he is probably the outstanding military leader and strategist that we have in America today.	0
ClaimBuster	14464	But where I have moved to work with the American people to help them have the tools to make the most of their own lives, I think I should get some credit for that.	0
ClaimBuster	14465	We'll never have uh - an end to the inflationary spiral, and we'll never have a balanced budget until we get our people back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	14466	Up until about $70,000, as you go up the ladder, my proposals will be far more beneficial.	1
ClaimBuster	14467	Let's reform it and fund it.	0
ClaimBuster	14468	I think credibility is important.	0
ClaimBuster	14469	Now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	14470	Mr. Ford has uh - misquoted an AP uh - news story that was in error to begin with.	1
ClaimBuster	14471	And I think it's time that when you got a job in this country it came with health insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	14472	One reason family farmers are forced to sell early is because of the death tax.	1
ClaimBuster	14473	If we're moving ahead, if we're providing a viable economy, if our people have sufficient resources so that they can consume what we produce; then this country's on the move, then we're stronger, then we set a better example to the world.	0
ClaimBuster	14474	I want you to be able to choose the health care for you and your family.	0
ClaimBuster	14475	And we cut those three hundred - uh agencies and so forth down substantially.	1
ClaimBuster	14476	It is important, though, for us to use all the tools at our disposal to prevent the scenario where we've got to make those kinds of choices.	0
ClaimBuster	14477	If you put term limits in and don't reform government, you won't get the benefits you thought.	0
ClaimBuster	14478	At the present time we're at peace.	0
ClaimBuster	14479	They're watching what we do, what we say, what we promise and what we finally deliver.	0
ClaimBuster	14480	Capital gains, investment tax allowance, credit for first- time homebuyers.	0
ClaimBuster	14481	They don't name him the most liberal in the United States Senate because he hasn't shown up to many meetings.	1
ClaimBuster	14482	And we've reached out to young people and their families and been able to help them by beginning drug education and prevention in the early elementary grades.	1
ClaimBuster	14483	So we have the problem of not only building our own uh - military strength and extending uh - our policies abroad, we have to do a job here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	14484	And we're not talking about failure of institutions on Wall Street.	0
ClaimBuster	14485	I think we ought to attack our country's problems, not attack each other.	0
ClaimBuster	14486	And it is true that this is going to be, I think, one of the most consequential decisions of the next president.	0
ClaimBuster	14487	That's why we want an economic package.	0
ClaimBuster	14488	They have been our friend since their inception as a nation.	1
ClaimBuster	14489	Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here.	0
ClaimBuster	14490	We're going to grow some of these jobs in America, because we need to get it -- they're going the wrong way.	0
ClaimBuster	14491	But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.	0
ClaimBuster	14492	I'm also very tough on violent crime.	0
ClaimBuster	14493	Well, I don't know of any perfect solution.	0
ClaimBuster	14494	Who's the best person to get results and not talk?	0
ClaimBuster	14495	I think we have to make progress first in the field of employment.	0
ClaimBuster	14496	Look, Governor Romney's called for $5 trillion of tax cuts that he says he's going to pay for by closing deductions.	1
ClaimBuster	14497	I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us.	0
ClaimBuster	14498	And I will not stop in our efforts to hunt down and kill the terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	14499	Well, the other day, Vice President Bush disclosed his tax returns to the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	14500	Yes, I'd be glad to.	0
ClaimBuster	14501	But all of my proposals are focused on that problem, gun safety.	1
ClaimBuster	14502	That's why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars.	1
ClaimBuster	14503	So it seems to me that we can talk about what we call Kenny, the great exaggerator.	0
ClaimBuster	14504	I think it's time America started moving again.	0
ClaimBuster	14505	One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet.	0
ClaimBuster	14506	But I got a better plan.	0
ClaimBuster	14507	And that was now all on tape, started by her.	1
ClaimBuster	14508	Which means, of course, that uh - we will have to maintain an adequate military capability - which means, of course, that we will have to add a uh - I think uh - a few billion dollars to our defense appropriations to make certain that we have adequate uh -strategic forces - adequate conventional forces.	0
ClaimBuster	14509	Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work...	0
ClaimBuster	14510	We'd better wait and see what the results are.	0
ClaimBuster	14511	He's broken it three times in the past year already.	1
ClaimBuster	14512	But for me to try, in this very pluralistic society of ours, to try to frame any definition, whatever, of what that belief should be, is wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	14513	He talked about children whose parents don't speak English as a first language?	1
ClaimBuster	14514	They are now operating in 60 countries.	1
ClaimBuster	14515	And we'll get our economy going again.	0
ClaimBuster	14516	I've made that clear throughout my presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	14517	The use of cocaine, for example, by teenagers is dramatically down.	1
ClaimBuster	14518	But that doesn't cost any more as far as the federal treasury is concerned.	1
ClaimBuster	14519	This really underscores the problem with the American health-care system.	0
ClaimBuster	14520	And one of the things I want to do is make sure that we're providing incentives so that you can buy a fuel efficient car that's made right here in the United States of America, not in Japan or South Korea, making sure that you are able to weatherize your home or make your business more fuel efficient.	0
ClaimBuster	14521	Governor Carter has embraced the record of the present Congress, dominated by his political party.	1
ClaimBuster	14522	Now here is the difference.	0
ClaimBuster	14523	It is now running at 12.7%.	1
ClaimBuster	14524	And spending restraint has got to be a vital part of that.	0
ClaimBuster	14525	And therefore, he said, many of these countries now feel that the Soviet Union, which was once so backward, is now on a par with the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	14526	We had a 1.2 million bankruptcy, set a new record.	1
ClaimBuster	14527	We can correct our difficult mistakes and answer those very tough questions.	0
ClaimBuster	14528	The test is, are you doing everything possible to make America safe?	0
ClaimBuster	14529	Tomorrow, Afghanistan will be voting for a president.	1
ClaimBuster	14530	All I'm saying is if you spend money, show us results and test every year, which you do not do, Mr. Vice President.	1
ClaimBuster	14531	I recognize we can't do it now, nor do I advocate an immediate withdrawal.	0
ClaimBuster	14532	We've got to deal with things like racial profiling.	0
ClaimBuster	14533	No, I think the debate ought to be between you and Lloyd.	0
ClaimBuster	14534	Making life so miserable on folks that they'll leave.	0
ClaimBuster	14535	Now the Senator referred to the Committee on Government Contracts.	1
ClaimBuster	14536	It wasn't just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	14537	It's hurt the housing market because Dodd-Frank didn't anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have.	1
ClaimBuster	14538	I'm only reducing the amount of the increase.	0
ClaimBuster	14539	And I don't think that's just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	14540	But it doesn't take just a quiet uh - dormant uh minimum enforcement of the law.	0
ClaimBuster	14541	She's made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	14542	Soros, who's a friend of hers, took a massive deduction.	1
ClaimBuster	14543	Don't forget what he tried to do with health care.	0
ClaimBuster	14544	I suggest now that our number one preoccupation is red ink and our country and we've got to put our people back to work so that we can afford to do these things we want to do in Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	14545	Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country.	0
ClaimBuster	14546	We cut taxes for 15 million working Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	14547	And some would say maybe me more so than others.	0
ClaimBuster	14548	And that's an image of strength -- except that if he had had his way when the Nimitz was being planned, he would have been deep in the water out there because there wouldn't have been any Nimitz to stand on -- he was against it.	1
ClaimBuster	14549	And they get health care.	1
ClaimBuster	14550	I believe Washington ought to set standards, but again I think we ought to be collaborative at the local levels and I think we ought to work with people at the local levels.	0
ClaimBuster	14551	I think what we need to do is convince people who live in the lands they live in to build the nations.	0
ClaimBuster	14552	That's the wrong way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	14553	Yes, this had to do with our disarmament talks.	0
ClaimBuster	14554	They're still number one today.	1
ClaimBuster	14555	We helped stabilize the situation with some troops, and when the African Union came, we moved them out.	1
ClaimBuster	14556	We'd put money into the hands of people who work hard, who obey the rules, who play for the American dream.	0
ClaimBuster	14557	You can make a lot of money and pay lower tax rates than somebody who makes a lot less.	1
ClaimBuster	14558	Chris Reeve is a friend of mine.	1
ClaimBuster	14559	Whether it be bringing climate change to the floor of the Senate for the first time.	0
ClaimBuster	14560	He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.	1
ClaimBuster	14561	The HMO, the insurance company, can't gag that doctor from giving you full advice.	1
ClaimBuster	14562	Nobody has more respect for women than I do.	0
ClaimBuster	14563	On pay for teachers, on all these categories, Arkansas is right near the very bottom.	1
ClaimBuster	14564	Now I've come out with a new agenda for America's renewal, a plan that I believe really will help stimulate the growth of this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	14565	The second thing that we can do is provide a fair trade playing field.	0
ClaimBuster	14566	It made a lot of sense.	0
ClaimBuster	14567	The president has term limits.	1
ClaimBuster	14568	I do not believe that we, the United States, should sell, give or otherwise transfer military hardware to the People's Republic of China, or any other Communist nation, such as the Soviet Union and the like.	0
ClaimBuster	14569	And once they feel secure, then they lead normal, social, economic, political lives, the same thing that's happening in Iraq today.	1
ClaimBuster	14570	Capitalism is growing and thriving across big portions of China.	1
ClaimBuster	14571	America is the greatest place on the face of the earth.	0
ClaimBuster	14572	Whichever place you put it.	0
ClaimBuster	14573	I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through.	0
ClaimBuster	14574	Iraq was not even close to the center of the war on terror before the president invaded it.	1
ClaimBuster	14575	So it's one of my top priorities.	0
ClaimBuster	14576	We cannot protect countries all over the world...	0
ClaimBuster	14577	It wasn't until election year, Mr. President, that you ever thought about stopping smoking.	1
ClaimBuster	14578	That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record.	0
ClaimBuster	14579	Americans are hurting right now, and they're angry.	0
ClaimBuster	14580	But I don't think we can be satisfied when we're spending $150 billion a year in interest alone on the national debt, much of it going to foreign bankers; or when 25 percent of our high school students are dropping out of school; or when we have 2-1/2 million of our fellow citizens, a third of them veterans, who are homeless and living on streets and in doorways in this country, when Mr. Bush's prescription for our economic future is another tax giveaway to the rich.	1
ClaimBuster	14581	But you're absolutely correct, it is a threat, it's a huge threat.	0
ClaimBuster	14582	And I think that it's going to take some time to work itself out.	0
ClaimBuster	14583	These make-work, temporary jobs - dead end as they are - are not the kind of jobs that we want for our people.	0
ClaimBuster	14584	And I've fought to simplify it, and I have proposals to simplify it.	1
ClaimBuster	14585	I want the future, and I think we have to grab it.	0
ClaimBuster	14586	The end of the Cold War brings an incredible opportunity for change.	0
ClaimBuster	14587	I own a timber company?	0
ClaimBuster	14588	If we had not taken our initiative, it's very, very possible that uh - the government of Rhodesia would have been overrun and that the Soviet Union and the Cubans would have dominated uh - southern Africa.	0
ClaimBuster	14589	And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state.	0
ClaimBuster	14590	I am concerned about ethnic cleansing.	0
ClaimBuster	14591	"Say, ""I made a terrible mistake."""	0
ClaimBuster	14592	I would have, first of all, across-the-board spending freeze, OK?	0
ClaimBuster	14593	And as a consequence, there's no doubt that attitudes about Americans have changed.	0
ClaimBuster	14594	I think the government's spending too much.	0
ClaimBuster	14595	If every family in America signed up, like the senator suggested, if would cost us $5 trillion over 10 years.	1
ClaimBuster	14596	She's got tremendous -- she's got tremendous hatred.	0
ClaimBuster	14597	And I think the biggest dividend of making these tough calls is the fact that we are less afraid of nuclear war.	0
ClaimBuster	14598	No one can be opposed to alternate energy.	0
ClaimBuster	14599	And it shouldn't be allowed to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	14600	I believe in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	14601	It hurts the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	14602	And of course, we're talking about positive plan of action to restore this economy and restore jobs in America.	0
ClaimBuster	14603	It added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned.	1
ClaimBuster	14604	We've been challenged, and we've risen to those challenges.	0
ClaimBuster	14605	We are quarantining Mr. Castro today.	1
ClaimBuster	14606	And if India should lose her battle, with thirty-five per cent of the people of the underdeveloped world within her borders, then I believe that the balance of power could move against us.	1
ClaimBuster	14607	Tell Aleksander Kwasniewski of Poland we're going alone.	0
ClaimBuster	14608	The Shah had done our bidding and carried our load in the Middle East for quite some time, and I did think that it was a blot on our record that we let him down.	1
ClaimBuster	14609	And, Jim, I -- I've been not feeling too great about a lot of things lately.	0
ClaimBuster	14610	The Braves, one; the Cardinals, nothing, early on.	1
ClaimBuster	14611	And that's probably a promise that Governor Romney thinks I've kept.	0
ClaimBuster	14612	Well, the economy is still growing slow.	1
ClaimBuster	14613	It's time for a chief executive who can make tough choices, can work with the Congress, can get that deficit down and begin to build a strong fiscal foundation under this country.	0
ClaimBuster	14614	He would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	14615	I'm against the grain embargo; it was a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	14616	I'd like to say you can also take a little time off without losing your job to go to a regular parent-teacher conference or to go to a regular doctor's appointment with a family member.	0
ClaimBuster	14617	And we were stymied until the families of 9/11 came, and they descended on Washington, and we got that legislation passed.	1
ClaimBuster	14618	There were several off-the-subject quaffers in that litany.	1
ClaimBuster	14619	We can work with the entertainment industry to provide family hour.	0
ClaimBuster	14620	I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do.	0
ClaimBuster	14621	I just think that we ought to support the decision.	0
ClaimBuster	14622	I have said again and again, and this really upsets the establishment in Washington, that we're going to inform the people in detail on the issues through an electronic town hall so that they really know what's going on.	1
ClaimBuster	14623	Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that.	0
ClaimBuster	14624	You don't know who broke in to DNC.	0
ClaimBuster	14625	We're not -- we're not -- we're not rifle shots here.	0
ClaimBuster	14626	That's what the election's about.	0
ClaimBuster	14627	You know, four years ago, we were going through a major crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	14628	But there's a difference in terms of how we would do it.	0
ClaimBuster	14629	That shows that there's been more growth in this Administration than in its predecessor.	1
ClaimBuster	14630	If he's trying to allege that I'm a hard-hearted person and I don't care about children, he's absolutely wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	14631	And the unique threat was that he could give weapons of mass destruction to an organization like Al Qaida, and the harm they inflicted on us with airplanes would be multiplied greatly by weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	14632	Take a look at it.	0
ClaimBuster	14633	In other words, a President has to make choices.	0
ClaimBuster	14634	Senator Obama will tell you, in the -- as the extreme environmentalists do, it has to be safe.	0
ClaimBuster	14635	This is a government that is not serving you.	0
ClaimBuster	14636	And I think that we have to do it as quickly as possible, because it's been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse, not better.	1
ClaimBuster	14637	And I did as secretary of state.	1
ClaimBuster	14638	The President says it'll disappear automatically.	0
ClaimBuster	14639	Recently Ian Smith, the uh - president of uh - Rhodesia, announced that he had unequivocal commitments from Mr. Kissinger that he could not reveal.	1
ClaimBuster	14640	She's been doing it a long time.	0
ClaimBuster	14641	And so I say that we believe that our policies of military strength, of economic strength, of diplomatic firmness first will keep the peace and keep it without surrender.	0
ClaimBuster	14642	We're going to have a lot of free trade.	0
ClaimBuster	14643	And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	14644	If you got the Government down to the lowest level, that you yourself could say it could not go any lower and still perform the services for the people, and if the recovery was so complete that you knew you were getting the ultimate amount of revenues that you could get through that growth, and there was still some slight difference there between those two lines, then I had said once that, yes, you would have to then look to see if taxes should not be adjusted.	0
ClaimBuster	14645	Karl Marx said that the free enterprise system in a democracy can only continue to exist when they are at war or preparing far war.	1
ClaimBuster	14646	I don't want to embarrass our oldest daughter.	0
ClaimBuster	14647	I'm going to be able to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	14648	Obviously, no President wants war, and I certainly do not believe that Governor Reagan, if he were President, would want war, but a President in the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace, through diplomacy, or in a careless way in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past.	0
ClaimBuster	14649	Cracking down on China when they cheat.	0
ClaimBuster	14650	And, as a matter of fact, it just so happens that in the quirks of administering these taxes, those above $50,000 actually did not get quite as big a tax cut percentage-wise as did those from 50,000 down.	1
ClaimBuster	14651	We have to be able to sell abroad more than we consume uh - from abroad if we're going to be able to meet our obligations.	0
ClaimBuster	14652	And we have fought back for four years to get out of that mess.	1
ClaimBuster	14653	So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country.	0
ClaimBuster	14654	I believe we can and we ought to.	0
ClaimBuster	14655	And my case to the American people is, if you're happy with inactivity, stay with the horse.	0
ClaimBuster	14656	He's made these claims repeatedly.	1
ClaimBuster	14657	And that's why he wants to veto it, just like he vetoed an earlier bill this year.	1
ClaimBuster	14658	And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors.	1
ClaimBuster	14659	But I would ask the American people to understand that if we make imprudent cuts, if we go too far, we risk the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	14660	-- -- and the people of the Soviet Union want it to stop.	0
ClaimBuster	14661	New business formation is down to the lowest level in 30 years under this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	14662	It's long overdue time to raise the minimum wage.	0
ClaimBuster	14663	You know, it's not a bank account that just pays back money that's invested.	0
ClaimBuster	14664	We have now uh - for instance only 7 percent of the total education cost being financed by the federal government.	1
ClaimBuster	14665	Secondly, we've got to invest in economic growth in this country, in every part of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	14666	So we've talked about our responsibility tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	14667	I have been a hunter all my life and happen to own both shotguns, rifles, and a handgun.	1
ClaimBuster	14668	And this is where there's a difference, because Governor Romney's central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut -- on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts -- that's another trillion dollars -- and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn't asked for.	1
ClaimBuster	14669	He lost the Wisconsin primary.	1
ClaimBuster	14670	I could do a better job.	0
ClaimBuster	14671	And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary?	0
ClaimBuster	14672	In the last four years, you cut permits and licenses on federal land and federal waters in half.	1
ClaimBuster	14673	They asked for the tanks.	1
ClaimBuster	14674	So my attitude is, we've got to grow the economy from the bottom up.	0
ClaimBuster	14675	They did it on the Medicaid prescription drug bill and we have to change the culture.	1
ClaimBuster	14676	He's shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico.	1
ClaimBuster	14677	And in the secrecy that has surrounded our foreign policy in the last few years, uh - the American people, the Congress have been excluded.	0
ClaimBuster	14678	I believe that limited approach to the - to the question would be uh - advisable, and - and I think, adequate.	0
ClaimBuster	14679	The kind of tests which you can't detect are underground or in - in uh - perhaps in outer space.	0
ClaimBuster	14680	We're selling everything from from -- from telephones to CDs to rice in Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	14681	Congress has gotten kind of institutionalized.	0
ClaimBuster	14682	"In 1955, Mr. Dulles at a press conference said: ""The treaty that we have with the Republic of China excludes Quemoy and Matsu from the treaty area."""	1
ClaimBuster	14683	We're getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	14684	It seems to me that we ought to support the California civil rights initiative.	0
ClaimBuster	14685	In fact, we had a conversation about our mothers one day, a very poignant conversation in the White House.	1
ClaimBuster	14686	We've gotta get this country growing again and this economy strong again or we can't bring down the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	14687	The deficit was bigger than I thought it was going to be.	0
ClaimBuster	14688	We are playing the leadership role.	0
ClaimBuster	14689	And let me give you an example of what I mean.	0
ClaimBuster	14690	The worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coming together, as I said, they're looking to us.	0
ClaimBuster	14691	Basically it means they can't learn.	0
ClaimBuster	14692	And according to Investors Daily, which I read just a couple of days ago, 88 percent of the people he claims credit for are already covered in collective bargaining agreements or other agreements.	1
ClaimBuster	14693	I have fully funded the land and water conservation program; in fact, have recommended and the Congress approved a substantially increased land and water conservation program.	1
ClaimBuster	14694	I hope I will do a good job as one who has had a relatively clean record with no conflicts of interest in his own public life, as has the Governor, to exhort young people to get into public service.	0
ClaimBuster	14695	Now, we're going to have to make sure that as we trade with other nations that they play by the rules.	0
ClaimBuster	14696	It needs to be available for emergency situations.	0
ClaimBuster	14697	We were not promoting democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	14698	But there has never been a nation in the history of the world that saw its economy decline and maintained its military superiority.	1
ClaimBuster	14699	And I'll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot.	1
ClaimBuster	14700	If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be.	1
ClaimBuster	14701	It's time for a new path.	0
ClaimBuster	14702	Now, I think we can do ethically guided embryonic stem-cell research.	0
ClaimBuster	14703	Now, not only oil and natural gas, which we've been investing in; but also, we've got to make sure we're building the energy source of the future, not just thinking about next year, but ten years from now, 20 years from now.	0
ClaimBuster	14704	We have 11 million undocumented people.	1
ClaimBuster	14705	"But I'm going to violate that rule and say ""never.''"	0
ClaimBuster	14706	And this used to be a bipartisan issue.	1
ClaimBuster	14707	That is the closest I have ever come to anything voluntary with Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	14708	And although we've heard a lot about Wall Street, those of you on Main Street I think have been struggling for a while, and you recognize that this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	14709	Now, the fact is you're going to have a hard time convincing folks that we were a whole lot better off eight years ago than we are today.	0
ClaimBuster	14710	And over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the -- the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to -- wants to follow.	0
ClaimBuster	14711	Don't forget, what's key to bringing back jobs here is not just finding someone else to punish, and I'm going to be strict with people who we trade with to make sure they -- they follow the law and play by the rules, but it's also to make America the most attractive place in the world for businesses of all kinds.	1
ClaimBuster	14712	What is fair is everybody who pays taxes ought to get relief.	0
ClaimBuster	14713	You may think the biggest employer in America is General Motors, but I've got news for you.	0
ClaimBuster	14714	But this country is not coming apart at the seams, for heaven's sakes.	0
ClaimBuster	14715	And the way to do that is to increase our exports.	0
ClaimBuster	14716	That is, I want to bring down rates.	0
ClaimBuster	14717	I don't check it that often.	1
ClaimBuster	14718	This president is the first president ever, I think, not to meet with the NAACP.	1
ClaimBuster	14719	First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	14720	And with this new Congress coming in, gridlock will be gone, and I'll sit down with them and say let's get this done.	0
ClaimBuster	14721	And that's why they were supportive of the approach that we took.	0
ClaimBuster	14722	One is to control nuclear weapons, which I hope we'll get to later on because that is the most important single issue in this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	14723	It'll be a vital issue in my second term.	0
ClaimBuster	14724	And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.	0
ClaimBuster	14725	So there are many, many heroes in this country today.	0
ClaimBuster	14726	We wanted to tie it to Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	14727	I'm absolutely opposed to a national health care plan.	0
ClaimBuster	14728	My average in two years is twenty-six.	1
ClaimBuster	14729	Now, let me just give you an example.	0
ClaimBuster	14730	And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	14731	But the rest of the public's going to be paying for it.	0
ClaimBuster	14732	We talk a lot about these things, but you look at the -- the record, you look at the record.	0
ClaimBuster	14733	But the most important thing is my plan for the 21st Century is a better plan.	0
ClaimBuster	14734	And he can insult General Scowcroft if he wants to.	0
ClaimBuster	14735	As a matter of fact, there's been a moratorium on testing as a result of the fact that we have been negotiating.	1
ClaimBuster	14736	You go to the heart of America's worries tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	14737	A whole bunch of folks in America are concerned about the way the Patriot Act has been applied.	0
ClaimBuster	14738	Another point I wanna make is this.	0
ClaimBuster	14739	So any -- any language to the contrary is simply not accurate.	0
ClaimBuster	14740	No, education is how to help the person who's lost a job.	0
ClaimBuster	14741	Several government departments -- several -- had information that he was converting our aid to military purposes and trying to develop weapons of mass destruction.	1
ClaimBuster	14742	But, Governor, when you were in Massachusetts, small businesses development ranked about 48th, I think out of 50 states in Massachusetts, because the policies that you are promoting actually don't help small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	14743	But I don't think it's fair to say, you haven't had cancer.	0
ClaimBuster	14744	I supported us going into Bosnia, when a number of my own party and colleagues was against that operation in Bosnia.	1
ClaimBuster	14745	And that for them is a catastrophically low number.	1
ClaimBuster	14746	But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently.	0
ClaimBuster	14747	Look, it's just not true.	0
ClaimBuster	14748	The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make.	0
ClaimBuster	14749	We have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001.	1
ClaimBuster	14750	I told you I'd cut taxes for small businesses, and I have.	1
ClaimBuster	14751	He voted against student loans; he voted against my improved student loan plan; he voted against the National Service bill, against the HeadStart bill; he voted against our efforts in safe and drug-free schools.	1
ClaimBuster	14752	You won't slow defense spending; you refuse to do that -- --	0
ClaimBuster	14753	So you can go out and create more jobs and more opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	14754	It is the number one culprit.	0
ClaimBuster	14755	And most of the law enforcement agencies in America wanted that assault weapons ban.	1
ClaimBuster	14756	And they're either going to be destroyed or left frozen.	0
ClaimBuster	14757	I have worked with Latinos -- one of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote.	1
ClaimBuster	14758	I think they're asking for new and creative ways to try to reach it with everyone involved.	0
ClaimBuster	14759	But I think that one area we agree on is the important of parents and the importance of schools, because I do believe that if our young people have opportunity, then they are less likely to engage in these kinds of violent acts.	0
ClaimBuster	14760	Donald doesn't agree with that.	1
ClaimBuster	14761	We need to get rid of that provision because it's killing regional and small banks.	0
ClaimBuster	14762	But there was a period there when Poland demonstrated a national independence and even the Polish government moved some differn- di- distance away from the Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	14763	Governor Romney, that's not what you said...	1
ClaimBuster	14764	The man is practicing fuzzy math again.	0
ClaimBuster	14765	I know they're popular, but I'm against them.	0
ClaimBuster	14766	Almost all of our citizens came here from other lands and now have hopes, which are being realized, for a better life, preserving their ethnic commitments, their family structures, their religious beliefs, preserving their relationships with their relatives in foreign countries, but still holding themselves together in a very coherent society, which gives our nation its strength.	1
ClaimBuster	14767	Secondly, in Haiti, political violence is much, much smaller than it was.	1
ClaimBuster	14768	Well, one thing I'd do is get rid of carried interest.	0
ClaimBuster	14769	To combat unemployment we first must concentrate on the very areas to which you refer - the so-called depressed areas.	0
ClaimBuster	14770	And the only gratifying thing is, I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money...	0
ClaimBuster	14771	It says we need to do better in terms of stimulating private business.	0
ClaimBuster	14772	It's not just a threat -- threat to the state of Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	14773	And I think that you pointed the way in your comments, because when you say there are multiple things accomplished by farmers, you're specifically including conservation and protection of the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	14774	I do want to just point out that autism, for example, or other special needs will require some additional funding, if we're going to get serious in terms of research.	0
ClaimBuster	14775	We did, 25 percent across the board.	1
ClaimBuster	14776	Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land.	1
ClaimBuster	14777	Which I think the American people would like to understand fully, it's been investigated to a degree, but -- but the administration has carried out executive privilege to prevent all of the information from coming out.	1
ClaimBuster	14778	Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street.	0
ClaimBuster	14779	And I agree, it works extremely well now.	0
ClaimBuster	14780	It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge.	1
ClaimBuster	14781	How you can cut school lunches, how you can cut student assistance, how you can cut housing, how you can cut disability benefits, how you can do all of these things and then the people receiving them -- for example, the disabled, who have no alternative -- how they're going to do better, I don't know.	0
ClaimBuster	14782	It is not a government takeover.	0
ClaimBuster	14783	I stand with the Secretary of State, Mr. Herter, who said these islands were indefensible.	1
ClaimBuster	14784	I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be able to own a gun.	0
ClaimBuster	14785	I don't agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that.	0
ClaimBuster	14786	He noted a few, but there are others.	0
ClaimBuster	14787	They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories.	1
ClaimBuster	14788	"General Ridgway said - who was Chief of Staff: ""To go to war for Quemoy and Matsu to me would seem an unwarranted and tragic course to take."	1
ClaimBuster	14789	And it was the House Republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem.	1
ClaimBuster	14790	And what we've done during the Bush administration, the Kurds were at the State Department, negotiating, trying to work their differences out.	1
ClaimBuster	14791	I was hopeful diplomacy would work in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	14792	With respect to North Korea, the real story: We had inspectors and television cameras in the nuclear reactor in North Korea.	1
ClaimBuster	14793	The approach that Governor Romney's talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	14794	More than ever, we need to be united as a country.	0
ClaimBuster	14795	In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	14796	It's one of the reasons I'm a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts.	0
ClaimBuster	14797	But I also dropped the bottom rate from 15% to 10%.	1
ClaimBuster	14798	... talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities.	1
ClaimBuster	14799	You decided to stay home, and that's OK.	0
ClaimBuster	14800	We ought to do the same with Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	14801	I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s.	0
ClaimBuster	14802	Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don't know the reasons.	1
ClaimBuster	14803	which his own running mate, George Bush, described as voodoo economics, and said that it would result in a 30% inflation rate.	1
ClaimBuster	14804	Libya's 6 million population; Egypt, 80 million population.	1
ClaimBuster	14805	He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.	1
ClaimBuster	14806	But we're also a nation of laws.	1
ClaimBuster	14807	most people, when they think about cutting Government spending, they think in terms of eliminating necessary programs or wiping out something, some service that Government is supposed to perform.	0
ClaimBuster	14808	I have watched these people -- the same for our local law enforcement people.	0
ClaimBuster	14809	We've going to make sure that you've got to have a living will so -- so we can know how you're going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don't have other taxpayer bailouts.	0
ClaimBuster	14810	I see it as a serious problem.	0
ClaimBuster	14811	When he selected his vice presidential running mate, he selected a man who had voted against most of these proposals and who opposes them at the present time.	1
ClaimBuster	14812	That adds up to 44 million people.	1
ClaimBuster	14813	I would also consider arming the Kurds.	0
ClaimBuster	14814	But where I differ with my opponent is I am not going to make unilateral cuts in our strategic defend systems or support some freeze when they have superiority.	0
ClaimBuster	14815	(Applause) And so I'm still a little unclear as to whether he's for or against the tax increase.	0
ClaimBuster	14816	In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE.	1
ClaimBuster	14817	I was asked a technical question.	1
ClaimBuster	14818	There are tasks that government legitimately should enforce and tasks that government performs well, and you've named some of them.	1
ClaimBuster	14819	We should have physical fitness programs and nutrition programs in schools.	0
ClaimBuster	14820	Mr. Ford's own uh - environmental agency has projected a 10 percent unemployment rate by 1978 if he's uh - president.	1
ClaimBuster	14821	The president blocked you from the right to have less expensive drugs from Canada.	1
ClaimBuster	14822	You don't get any gun.	0
ClaimBuster	14823	And then, just as Castro had done in Cuba, the Sandinistas ousted the other parties to the revolution.	1
ClaimBuster	14824	Now Senator Kennedy has referred to the vote on Communist China.	1
ClaimBuster	14825	I was 19 or 20 flying off an aircraft carrier and that shaped me to be Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces.	1
ClaimBuster	14826	We heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	14827	Mr. President, it's good to be with you again this evening, sir.	0
ClaimBuster	14828	But we must all decide first we have the courage to change for hope and a better tomorrow.	0
ClaimBuster	14829	I believe in the President's commission on outdoors.	0
ClaimBuster	14830	He said here were all these intellectuals out there griping and complaining and saying it was negative coverage.	0
ClaimBuster	14831	I remember going on an airplane in Bangor, Maine, to say thanks to the reservists and Guard that were headed overseas from Tennessee and North Carolina, Georgia.	1
ClaimBuster	14832	Look, I've been in business for 25 years.	1
ClaimBuster	14833	Today, 47 million people on food stamps.	1
ClaimBuster	14834	The answer to that obviously was no, and as the result, I was elected to this office and promised a new beginning.	1
ClaimBuster	14835	I want to give a tax credit for the purchase of individual health insurance plans.	0
ClaimBuster	14836	But I'll always remember that the best weapons are the ones that are never fired in combat, and the best soldier is one who never has to lay his life down on the field of battle.	0
ClaimBuster	14837	As a matter of fact, the population explosion, if you look at the actual figures, has been vastly exaggerated -- over exaggerated.	1
ClaimBuster	14838	I wish he could have been with me when I sat with a group of teenagers who were black, and who were telling me about their unemployment problems, and that it was the minimum wage that had done away with the jobs that they once could get.	1
ClaimBuster	14839	Then the President sent a mission, composed of Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek in the spring of fifty-five to withdraw from the two islands, because they were exposed.	1
ClaimBuster	14840	You know he came to the Senate and never once proposed legislation to do that?	1
ClaimBuster	14841	I would say further that to blame the President in his veto power for the inability of the Senator and his colleagues to get action in this special session uh - misses the mark.	0
ClaimBuster	14842	Now, with respect to Fannie Mae, what Senator McCain didn't mention is the fact that this bill that he talked about wasn't his own bill.	1
ClaimBuster	14843	And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for, but also being willing to say no to some things.	0
ClaimBuster	14844	He voted against the first Gulf War.	1
ClaimBuster	14845	And I have enormous difference with the ACLU on their politic agenda.	0
ClaimBuster	14846	I'm not for command and control techniques either.	1
ClaimBuster	14847	The fact of the matter is if the Pledge of Allegiance was the acid test of one's patriotism--the vice president's been the presiding officer in the United States Senate for the past seven and a half years.	0
ClaimBuster	14848	I am concerned about the fact that 10 percent of our manufacturing and 20 percent of our banking and nearly half of the real estate in the city of Los Angeles are in the hands of foreign investors.	1
ClaimBuster	14849	Now we've increased that amount 25 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	14850	Governor Reagan is making some very misleading and disturbing statements.	0
ClaimBuster	14851	I believe that when you know something's going wrong, you make it right.	0
ClaimBuster	14852	I'm a year ahead of schedule.	1
ClaimBuster	14853	We have not seen the progress we need to have, and I'm convinced that with strong leadership and an effort to build a strategy based upon helping these nations reject extremism, we can see the kind of peace and prosperity the world demands.	0
ClaimBuster	14854	But let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	14855	It is something one would only - only consider if all of the other avenues had been -- had been tried to their full extent.	0
ClaimBuster	14856	It's pollution, carbon dioxide, and other chemicals that are even more potent, but in smaller quantities, that cause this.	1
ClaimBuster	14857	And you're right, I haven't vetoed any spending bills, because we work together.	1
ClaimBuster	14858	Oh, I'm it's my question.	0
ClaimBuster	14859	Cocaine use up 160 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	14860	Well, Mr. Ford, unfortunately, has just made a statement that's not true.	1
ClaimBuster	14861	A targeted tax cut, a real commitment to educational reform.	0
ClaimBuster	14862	This has been such an incredible education for me, Chris.	0
ClaimBuster	14863	That is why I think the Senate was right, including a majority of the Democrats, a majority of the Republicans, when they rejected Senator Kennedy's position in 1955.	1
ClaimBuster	14864	But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high.	1
ClaimBuster	14865	In my opinion, the government is not effective in -- in bringing down the cost of almost anything.	0
ClaimBuster	14866	In the Georgia government we only had one agency responsible for drug treatment.	1
ClaimBuster	14867	In the final analysis, I'm doing this for your children when you look at them tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	14868	He - we have a big difference on issues.	0
ClaimBuster	14869	We're going to have a lot of work to do, so I can't guarantee that we're going to do it in the next two years, but I'd like to do in the my first term as president.	0
ClaimBuster	14870	And as I just said that I believe that the passage of the so-called Title Three, which gives the Attorney General the power to protect Constitutional rights in those cases where it's not possible for the person involved to bring the suit.	1
ClaimBuster	14871	But they didn't have much of a partner in government here as compared with the policies the Germans and the Japanese followed, and I believe we can do better.	0
ClaimBuster	14872	But I must stop short of using American force until I know how those young men and women are going to get out of there as well as get in, know what the mission is, and define it.	0
ClaimBuster	14873	I don't think the National Rifle Association ran that ad.	0
ClaimBuster	14874	Somewhere in between those numbers -- and so there's a difference, what he's promised and what he can raise.	1
ClaimBuster	14875	Mr. Khrushchev is in New York, and he maintains the Communist offensive throughout the world because of the productive power of the Soviet Union itself.	1
ClaimBuster	14876	That's not how America was built.	0
ClaimBuster	14877	Young people are looking to us.	0
ClaimBuster	14878	And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way.	0
ClaimBuster	14879	And that terrible circumstance in this country is exported overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	14880	And there's a lot of fear -- in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect.	1
ClaimBuster	14881	Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things.	1
ClaimBuster	14882	That's not going to work.	0
ClaimBuster	14883	That's not a way to invite people.	0
ClaimBuster	14884	Number one, beef up our security and procedures, not just in Libya, but at every embassy and consulate in the region.	0
ClaimBuster	14885	He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote the other way, but we lost by one vote.	1
ClaimBuster	14886	And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil.	1
ClaimBuster	14887	And fortunately the rainy season will be ending shortly, which will make it easier to get aid there and help the long-suffering people there.	1
ClaimBuster	14888	And I think it's her campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	14889	If we keep somebody -- you know, illegally using a gun, there needs to be a consequence.	0
ClaimBuster	14890	Mr. McGee, we have a contractual right to be in Berlin coming out of the conversations at Potsdam and of World War II.	1
ClaimBuster	14891	And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive.	1
ClaimBuster	14892	We've got to make things here.	0
ClaimBuster	14893	And I saw that, and I saw the situation, and I stood up, and I voted against that, because I was afraid that they couldn't make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred Marines would make a difference.	1
ClaimBuster	14894	Now none of that will happen anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	14895	I would say to them, look at the job retraining programs that we're proposing.	0
ClaimBuster	14896	And I believe we require someone who can work harmoniously with the Congress, who can work closely with the people of this country, and who can bring a new image and a new spirit to Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	14897	Now, what we haven't talked about is Senator McCain's plan.	1
ClaimBuster	14898	I wish the President would say: Yes, the CBO is right.	0
ClaimBuster	14899	Which would be uh - to continue the progress that has been made under the last two uh - courts - the Warren Court and the Burger Court.	0
ClaimBuster	14900	So we can have a tax cut but my priority would be to help the families who need it with child rearing and education and buying a first-time home and helping for health care costs.	0
ClaimBuster	14901	They're breaking business's legs in a number of different ways.	0
ClaimBuster	14902	It has not worked for America.	0
ClaimBuster	14903	George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, so there are differences between Governor Romney and George Bush, but they're not on economic policy.	1
ClaimBuster	14904	And instead of concentrating on tax cuts mostly for the wealthy, we want -- I want tax cuts for the middle-class families and I want to continue the prosperity and make sure that it enriches not just a few but all of our families.	0
ClaimBuster	14905	Now, I'm going to add 40,000 active duty forces to the military, and I'm going to make people feel good about being safe in our military, and not overextended, because I'm going to run a foreign policy that actually does what President Reagan did, President Eisenhower did, and others.	0
ClaimBuster	14906	Government-sponsored health care would lead to rationing.	0
ClaimBuster	14907	How do we get schools to be more competitive?	0
ClaimBuster	14908	We are not a nation in decline.	0
ClaimBuster	14909	General Petraeus has just taken over a position of responsibility, where he has the command and will really set the tone for the strategy and tactics that are used.	1
ClaimBuster	14910	An I don't think that is going to be an effective tool to make the -- keep our society safe.	0
ClaimBuster	14911	No, I didn't say that at all.	1
ClaimBuster	14912	But what is at stake here in this health care issue is the fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	14913	I support a woman's right to choose.	1
ClaimBuster	14914	Mr. Mondale referred to the farmers' worst year.	1
ClaimBuster	14915	And we now know that he was not out of the loop; he was in meeting after meeting listening to Secretary Shultz and Secretary Weinberger opposing that, and yet he supported it.	1
ClaimBuster	14916	And it's very hard for us to project leadership around the world when we're not doing what we need to do...	0
ClaimBuster	14917	I want to fully fund education, No Child Left Behind, special-needs education.	0
ClaimBuster	14918	It's all covered in the plan.	1
ClaimBuster	14919	This is a very, very difficult and fundamental decision that all of us have to make.	0
ClaimBuster	14920	I was born to a widowed mother who gave me family values, and grandparents.	1
ClaimBuster	14921	For example, we uh - proposed about $12 million to add between four and five hundred more employees for the National Park Service.	1
ClaimBuster	14922	It is because America has not invested in its people.	0
ClaimBuster	14923	But there are other things that we can do with the inner cities, and I've believed.	0
ClaimBuster	14924	We're lucky to have her heading the commission.	0
ClaimBuster	14925	That is a misstatement, of course, of my position.	0
ClaimBuster	14926	Our conventional strength in Europe is under strength.	1
ClaimBuster	14927	We passed an area redevelopment bill far more effective than the bill the Administration suggested, on two occasions, and the President vetoed it both times.	1
ClaimBuster	14928	We will not be a great country unless we have a strong family unit in every home.	0
ClaimBuster	14929	The world is more dangerous today.	0
ClaimBuster	14930	This has got to be stopped.	0
ClaimBuster	14931	Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936 that that generation of Americans had a rendezvous with destiny.	1
ClaimBuster	14932	So it's not a question of his heart, as far as I know.	0
ClaimBuster	14933	But with these projections, we will have a balanced budget by fiscal year 1981, if I'm elected president.	0
ClaimBuster	14934	Number 2, with regard to Social Security, that program -- a lot of you may not know this -- it produces a $70 billion surplus a year.	1
ClaimBuster	14935	I believe we can be successful.	0
ClaimBuster	14936	They all have their strengths and they all have their weaknesses.	0
ClaimBuster	14937	That's why we don't have full employment today.	0
ClaimBuster	14938	We need a program for the uninsured.	0
ClaimBuster	14939	One, a lot of folks are still waiting for that 1992 middle-class tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	14940	Mr. Lehrer, I hope we'll have a chance to discuss drugs later in the program.	0
ClaimBuster	14941	It is a large Communist movement to take over the Philippines.	0
ClaimBuster	14942	Just about every family I know, the main concern is how am I going to succeed at work and still do right by my children.	1
ClaimBuster	14943	We didn't have enough forces.	0
ClaimBuster	14944	He is the man on conventional forces that wants to eliminate two carrier battle groups.	0
ClaimBuster	14945	And so, I think that the lines can meet.	0
ClaimBuster	14946	The Kerr bill provided assistance to all those who were not on Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	14947	I don't believe Hillary will.	0
ClaimBuster	14948	Now, I'm not capable, and I don't think you are, any of us, to make this determination that must be made with regard to human life.	0
ClaimBuster	14949	He's also the only president in 72 years to lose jobs -- 1.6 million jobs lost.	1
ClaimBuster	14950	Oh, no, it will cost jobs, but that's not -- let me say this.	0
ClaimBuster	14951	We cut the rate of increase in spending in half.	1
ClaimBuster	14952	And by the way, I just want to make sure -- I can't let him just say something and not correct it.	0
ClaimBuster	14953	This is public ethics; I'm not talking about private ethics.	0
ClaimBuster	14954	The only people that are going to reform Russia are Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	14955	And he stands here and says politicians who make promises like that ought to be ignored.	0
ClaimBuster	14956	For those of you who he wants to scare into the voting booth to vote for him, hear me loud and clear.	0
ClaimBuster	14957	And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and all the people who are watching.	0
ClaimBuster	14958	But at the same time, we gave back to the people of California - in tax rebates, tax credits, tax cuts - $5.7 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	14959	Have a gun-free zone around every school in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	14960	Spain -- Spain spends 42 percent of their total economy on government.	1
ClaimBuster	14961	Fifty-four percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed as individuals.	1
ClaimBuster	14962	If the American people want to do it and not talk about it, then they ought to -- you know, I'm one person they ought to consider.	0
ClaimBuster	14963	I'm the first president ever to allow funding -- federal funding -- for embryonic stem-cell research.	1
ClaimBuster	14964	If you've got health insurance, most of you have seen your premiums double over the last eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	14965	I signed the homeland security bill to better align our assets and resources.	1
ClaimBuster	14966	People have lost their health care or are going bankrupt because they get sick.	0
ClaimBuster	14967	I can't understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	14968	With respect to something like coal, we made the largest investment in clean coal technology, to make sure that even as we're producing more coal, we're producing it cleaner and smarter.	1
ClaimBuster	14969	You showed no recognition of the Administration program to try to persuade Chiang Kai-shek for the last five years to withdraw from the islands.	1
ClaimBuster	14970	Well, look, I think that we do have a disagreement about an across-the-board spending freeze.	1
ClaimBuster	14971	I hope I've earned your trust because a lot of being president is about trust and character.	0
ClaimBuster	14972	Her husband's a pretty tough guy, by the way, too.	0
ClaimBuster	14973	To send their kids to college with a $10,000 tax deduction for college tuition per child per year.	1
ClaimBuster	14974	When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	14975	What grade do you teach?	0
ClaimBuster	14976	Well, because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh - then I think you would have complete uh - economic chaos.	0
ClaimBuster	14977	But the larger point -- and he says this constantly -- is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.	1
ClaimBuster	14978	In January of uh - 1975 I submitted to the Congress and to the American people the first comprehensive energy program recommended by any president.	1
ClaimBuster	14979	I want this next generation to be the best educated in American history, to invest in the human mind and science again, so we're out front.	0
ClaimBuster	14980	That's the kind of approach that is just not going to work.	0
ClaimBuster	14981	And I think our allies would be very happy to go along with a fair and verifiable SALT agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	14982	I want to thank the University of Miami for hosting us.	0
ClaimBuster	14983	He has made the suggestion that what we need is to move in the direction of more government controls, a suggestion that would also mean raising prices uh - that the consumers pay for products and im- and imposing upon the farmers uh - controls on acreage even far more than they have today.	0
ClaimBuster	14984	I'll just make a quick comment about vouchers in D.C.	0
ClaimBuster	14985	Now, the Federal Government is going to turn around and say, well you have this problem; we will now hand you the money to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	14986	So, I would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this.	0
ClaimBuster	14987	I firmly believe, uh - Mr. Kraft, that it's unwise for a president to signal in advance what uh - options he might exercise if any uhh - international problem arose.	0
ClaimBuster	14988	And I'm so proud of what she accomplished in getting them on there.	0
ClaimBuster	14989	Because you're going to decide whether we're going to balance the budget now, but protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	14990	Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do.	0
ClaimBuster	14991	But I also believe that because we are the United States of America, we're a country with a great, unbelievable Constitution, with rights that we afford people, that you can't discriminate in the workplace.	0
ClaimBuster	14992	And I still believe, under the right leadership, our best days are ahead of us.	0
ClaimBuster	14993	And the result was unilateral disarmament.	1
ClaimBuster	14994	Now there isn't a dollar shortage, and yet many of these countries continue to move against our goods.	1
ClaimBuster	14995	See, here is the mentality.	0
ClaimBuster	14996	And let me tell you exactly why I think that the choice he made to give a tax cut for the oil companies and others before addressing this -- I mean, if you were the governor of a state that was dead last in health care for families, and all of a sudden you found yourself with the biggest surplus your state had ever had in its history, wouldn't you want to maybe use some of it to climb from 50th to, say, 45 or 40 or something or maybe better?	0
ClaimBuster	14997	U-2 flight in May just before the conference was a mistake in timing because of the hazards involved, if the summit conference had any hope for success.	0
ClaimBuster	14998	I'll never turn over America's national security needs to leaders of other countries, as we continue to build those alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	14999	But we have made vast improvements in our anti-terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	15000	I think it goes with world leadership, and I think the levels we've come up with are just about right.	0
ClaimBuster	15001	And when she brought a suit, saying equal pay for equal work, the judges said, well, you know, it's taken you too long to bring this lawsuit, even though she didn't know about it until fairly recently.	1
ClaimBuster	15002	But you cannot just get there by balancing the budget.	0
ClaimBuster	15003	You say, well, gee, what are you going to do about that?	0
ClaimBuster	15004	This is a heartless kind of approach to the working families of our country, which is typical of many Republican leaders of the past, but, I think, has been accentuated under Governor Reagan.	0
ClaimBuster	15005	Now, we're not a parliamentary body, the National Governors Association.	1
ClaimBuster	15006	And it would've put uh - very strict uh - uh - control over who owned a handgun.	0
ClaimBuster	15007	In this case, in the case of a financial crisis, I would gather all the facts before I made the decision as to what the government ought or ought not to do.	0
ClaimBuster	15008	It's a matter of leadership or no leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	15009	Nobody's ever seen that before.	0
ClaimBuster	15010	If the -- the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent when he took office, it's 7.8 percent now.	1
ClaimBuster	15011	Doesn't make me popular with the teachers union.	1
ClaimBuster	15012	I would go after Baghdadi.	0
ClaimBuster	15013	But I think the first criteria, Tom, would have to be somebody who immediately Americans identify with, immediately say, we can trust that individual.	0
ClaimBuster	15014	We are not doing that today.	0
ClaimBuster	15015	And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we're good.	0
ClaimBuster	15016	With regard to the employer sanctions, we must have that not only to ensure that we can identify the illegal aliens, but also, while some keep protesting about what it would do to employers, there is another employer that we shouldn't be so concerned about, and these are employers down through the years who have encouraged the illegal entry into this country because they then hire these individuals and hire them at starvation wages and with none of the benefits that we think are normal and natural for workers in our country, and the individuals can't complain because of their illegal status.	0
ClaimBuster	15017	It was in 1964 and that's what he called Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	15018	And so we can be a partner with China.	0
ClaimBuster	15019	I agree with Senator Kennedy's appraisal generally in this respect.	0
ClaimBuster	15020	And it's a question as to whether the United States will continue to lead for peace.	0
ClaimBuster	15021	It is true that earlier, working with some very prominent economists, I had come up, during the campaign, with an economic program that I thought could rectify the great problems confronting us -- the double-digit inflation, the high tax rates that I think were hurting the economy, the stagflation that we were undergoing.	1
ClaimBuster	15022	It can happen in America with the right kind of leadership.	1
ClaimBuster	15023	And it's a bad policy.	0
ClaimBuster	15024	One is to change Head Start to a reading program.	0
ClaimBuster	15025	We took the child to New York.	1
ClaimBuster	15026	I've been there now for fourteen years, the same period of time that he has, so that our experience in uh - government is comparable.	1
ClaimBuster	15027	It's my strong feeling that we ought to sell arms to Iran for its own national security, and as an ally - a strong ally of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	15028	The rate of regulations quadrupled under this president.	1
ClaimBuster	15029	We are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	15030	-- that he's going to be responsible.	0
ClaimBuster	15031	I think if I were a senior citizen I would be a little fed up with all these ads scaring seniors, scaring veterans and scaring students about education.	0
ClaimBuster	15032	Which is why as president, we funded an Iron Dome program to stop those missiles.	1
ClaimBuster	15033	We're spending $10 billion a month in Iraq at a time when the Iraqis have a $79 billion surplus, $79 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	15034	Yes, I think it's fine to do business with them.	0
ClaimBuster	15035	I had never worked in Washington as an elected official.	1
ClaimBuster	15036	And I will fight for the American worker just as hard as I fight for my own job.	0
ClaimBuster	15037	These programs that I described to you earlier - the tax deferrals for overseas, the DISC, and the tax shelters, uh - they only apply to people in the $50 thousand-a-year bracket or up, and I think this is the very best way to approach it.	1
ClaimBuster	15038	It's given us the highest small business failure in 50 years.	1
ClaimBuster	15039	It shows income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million.	1
ClaimBuster	15040	Now, to -- I still -- I just have a minute here?	0
ClaimBuster	15041	You may claim you've got mandatory testing but you don't, Mr. Vice President.	0
ClaimBuster	15042	We've got to understand in America that we've got to have growth, create more jobs and more opportunities in the private sector.	0
ClaimBuster	15043	The fact is that there was already a law on the books in Illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment, which is why not only myself but pro-choice Republicans and Democrats voted against it.	1
ClaimBuster	15044	9 Nobel Prize-winning economists and 500 others, including numerous Republican and Democratic business executives, have endorsed this approach because it offers the best hope to put America back to work and get our incomes rising instead of falling.	1
ClaimBuster	15045	The question of agriculture came up a minute ago.	1
ClaimBuster	15046	(Applause) I'd like to have that line-item veto for the president, because I think that would be extraordinarily helpful.	0
ClaimBuster	15047	And this president, I regret to say, has secured less nuclear material in the last two years since 9/11 than we did in the two years preceding 9/11.	1
ClaimBuster	15048	I have heard you say this time after time.	0
ClaimBuster	15049	But let's look at the performance.	0
ClaimBuster	15050	And we do have to have change and people who never take responsibility for anything when it happens on their watch and people who are in charge --	0
ClaimBuster	15051	Wouldn't it make a lot more sense if the government let them keep their own money there in the first place?	0
ClaimBuster	15052	I want to spend my time making this country even better than it is, not trying to make you out to be a bad person.	0
ClaimBuster	15053	The first position you took, when this matter first came up, was that we should draw the line and commit ourselves, as a matter of principle, to defend these islands.	1
ClaimBuster	15054	That's -- Governor, you're the last person who's going to get tough on China.	0
ClaimBuster	15055	We know how to get control of the debt.	0
ClaimBuster	15056	I don't think that's true at all.	0
ClaimBuster	15057	And for that reason he has contributed to any lack of prestige.	0
ClaimBuster	15058	And talk about not quitting, I'm spending my money on this campaign; the 2 parties are spending your money, taxpayer money.	1
ClaimBuster	15059	I only have 30 seconds.	1
ClaimBuster	15060	[Laughter] If they're antisatellite weapons, I assume they're going to be aimed against satellites.	0
ClaimBuster	15061	And that's one of the reasons the Afghan Security Forces have so much work to do to be able to fight against that.	0
ClaimBuster	15062	But look who's around with him there.	0
ClaimBuster	15063	Then a lot of mutual distrust developed.	0
ClaimBuster	15064	We cannot afford an intelligence gap.	0
ClaimBuster	15065	Syria is Iran's only ally in the Arab world.	1
ClaimBuster	15066	Instead, I want to build the Midgetman, which is mobile and thus less vulnerable, contributing to stability, and a weapon that will give us security and contribute to an incentive for arms control.	0
ClaimBuster	15067	The Reagan-Bush administration was right.	0
ClaimBuster	15068	And I do believe it would be inhibiting.	0
ClaimBuster	15069	So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.	0
ClaimBuster	15070	And the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the Secretary of State, our U.N.	0
ClaimBuster	15071	I've been a tolerant person all my life.	0
ClaimBuster	15072	No, actually, I think Senator McCain and I agree for the most part on these issues.	0
ClaimBuster	15073	And that, too, is a major difference between the vice president and me.	0
ClaimBuster	15074	We've got to stop some of these frivolous lawsuits.	0
ClaimBuster	15075	Now, I know millions of you still have anxieties.	0
ClaimBuster	15076	It's what we stand for.	0
ClaimBuster	15077	Back to Iran, just for a second.	0
ClaimBuster	15078	Doctors practice defensive medicine because of all the frivolous lawsuits that cost our government $28 billion a year.	1
ClaimBuster	15079	And in a war, there's a lot of -- there's a lot of tactical decisions that historians will look back and say: He shouldn't have done that.	0
ClaimBuster	15080	Now let me talk about what we've done in the White House as far as federal employees are concerned The first order that I issued after I became president was to cut or eliminate the prospective forty-thousand increase in federal employees that had been scheduled by my predecessor.	1
ClaimBuster	15081	But the efficiency of it, the simplicity of it, the uh ability of people to understand their own government and control it was a - was a uh - substantial benefit derived from complete reorganization.	0
ClaimBuster	15082	Well I think we should be no - under no illusions whatever about what the responsibilities of the American people will be in the sixties.	0
ClaimBuster	15083	That was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	15084	And the reason that it must grow even more is because we have things to do at home and also because we're in a race for survival - a race in which it isn't enough to be ahead; it isn't enough simply to be complacent.	0
ClaimBuster	15085	And you let those people go with the guidelines of overall policy, not looking over their shoulder and nitpicking the manner in which they go at the job.	0
ClaimBuster	15086	Energy -- well, first -- second of all, energy independence.	0
ClaimBuster	15087	Now there's what's called an Independent Review Organization that you have to go through first.	1
ClaimBuster	15088	We are going to appoint justices -- this is the best way to help the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	15089	I don't believe that there is anything this country cannot do.	0
ClaimBuster	15090	That's what got me into this race, so we could rebuild the American economy.	0
ClaimBuster	15091	See, we have an adversarial relationship between government and business.	0
ClaimBuster	15092	But we're going to have to use more gas, more coal and more safe nuclear power for our energy base.	0
ClaimBuster	15093	It leaves a hundred miles between the sea.	1
ClaimBuster	15094	If we do those things we will build that bridge to the 21st Century and the greatest country in history will be even greater.	0
ClaimBuster	15095	It failed because the House did not pass it and the House failed by eleven votes.	1
ClaimBuster	15096	We all know the possibility of terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	15097	Growth in the economy is gonna add to the overall prosperity and wealth.	0
ClaimBuster	15098	Seventy five percent of them have been brought to justice.	1
ClaimBuster	15099	The major threat is external and will continue.	0
ClaimBuster	15100	But this president hasn't even held the kind of statesman-like summits that pull people together and get them to invest in those states.	1
ClaimBuster	15101	Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our troops.	0
ClaimBuster	15102	And we better be awfully careful.	0
ClaimBuster	15103	We shouldn't be using food.	0
ClaimBuster	15104	I would not agree to any negotiations or any agreement that involved conduct on the part of the Soviet Union that we couldn't verify every day.	0
ClaimBuster	15105	But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself.	0
ClaimBuster	15106	It seems to me that we can go from there to uh - the uh - grain sales.	0
ClaimBuster	15107	And you folks out there are going to have to choose who you think is right.	0
ClaimBuster	15108	Bundles of cash as big as this stage.	1
ClaimBuster	15109	I always believed he was a threat.	0
ClaimBuster	15110	I think it's a fundamental difference.	0
ClaimBuster	15111	So, there seems to be no shortage of investment capital.	0
ClaimBuster	15112	And by the way, the breach on the agreement was not through plutonium.	1
ClaimBuster	15113	Our enterprise zones, that we hear a lot of lip service about in Congress, would bring jobs into the inner city.	0
ClaimBuster	15114	And that's why we've got to make some investments and I've called for investments in solar, wind, geothermal.	1
ClaimBuster	15115	And using that money, we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600, and we were also able to make a -- make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the -- throughout the system.	1
ClaimBuster	15116	"But let me tell you, point blank, the lines of stem cells that he's made available, every scientist in the country will tell you, ""Not adequate,"" because they're contaminated by mouse cells, and because there aren't 60 or 70 -- they're are only about 11 to 20 now -- and there aren't enough to be able to do the research because they're contaminated."	1
ClaimBuster	15117	My hope for America is a prosperous America, a hopeful America and a safer world.	0
ClaimBuster	15118	It makes you realize that whoever is president is going to be a man that all the children of America will either look up to, or will look down to.	0
ClaimBuster	15119	$665 billion over ten years for the wealthiest 1%.	1
ClaimBuster	15120	First of all, of course I know Osama bin Laden attacked us.	0
ClaimBuster	15121	And a lot of our military are underpaid.	1
ClaimBuster	15122	The allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another, and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation.	0
ClaimBuster	15123	There are great plans lying all over Washington nobody ever executes.	0
ClaimBuster	15124	And that question can only be answered by someone with the knowledge and experience and the judgment, the judgment to know when our national security is not only at risk, but where the United States of America can make a difference in preventing genocide, in preventing the spread of terrorism, in doing the things that the United States has done, not always well, but we've done because we're a nation of good.	0
ClaimBuster	15125	And, Tom, I know that we're under time constraints, but Senator McCain through a lot of stuff out there.	0
ClaimBuster	15126	They'll pay off our national debt.	0
ClaimBuster	15127	And the reason they blame Russia because they think they're trying to tarnish me with Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	15128	But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there.	1
ClaimBuster	15129	Ninety percent are on the honor role.	1
ClaimBuster	15130	Of course we're meeting our obligation to our veterans, and the veterans know that.	0
ClaimBuster	15131	We have fewer people working today than we had when the president took office.	1
ClaimBuster	15132	When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don't want them.	1
ClaimBuster	15133	When they protested that and suggested a smaller number, perhaps, I went along with that.	1
ClaimBuster	15134	We can do better than this.	0
ClaimBuster	15135	They're not the secrets to the nuclear bomb.	1
ClaimBuster	15136	We have good executive orders, and the CIA and the DIA and NASA uh - uh - NSA are now doing a good job under proper supervision.	0
ClaimBuster	15137	And the reason we've gotten it is because they see us now as unwilling to make the very kinds of unilateral cuts that have been called for and to go for the discredited freeze.	0
ClaimBuster	15138	I don't think that can be better illustrated than in the case of guaranteeing women equal rights under the Constitution of our nation.	0
ClaimBuster	15139	I would say to that person exactly what I will say to you right now.	0
ClaimBuster	15140	Look at the evidence of the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	15141	I think they're taxed too much.	0
ClaimBuster	15142	Those are some of the great issues - atomic warfare, the use of our natural resources, and the issue of nationalism - that I intend to be talking about in the remaining six weeks of this campaign, and I dare hope that the American people will be listening and that they will see that an Independent government of John Anderson and Patrick Lucey can give us the kind of coalition government that we need in 1980 to begin to solve our problems.	0
ClaimBuster	15143	Taxing people over $200,000 will not get you $150 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	15144	And guess who would get shuffled through?	0
ClaimBuster	15145	I've been paying taxes just like you and Lord knows, I've paid my share -- over a billion in taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	15146	She immediately -- when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	15147	... it's hard to get there from here.	0
ClaimBuster	15148	He had the facts that were released today immediately after the Mayaguez incident.	1
ClaimBuster	15149	I think that it has to be administered not only fairly with attention to things like DNA evidence, which I think should be used in all capital cases, but also with very careful attention.	0
ClaimBuster	15150	The VA provides lower-cost drugs to our veterans.	1
ClaimBuster	15151	And the initiatives that we took in southern Africa are the best examples of what this administration is doing and will continue to do in the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	15152	"Not only that, he said, ""I think that's what grows the economy."""	1
ClaimBuster	15153	We're talking about a massive government, folks.	0
ClaimBuster	15154	Real interest rates -- the real cost of interest -- will remain very, very high, and many economists are predicting that we're moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession.	0
ClaimBuster	15155	I'm not going to wear rose-colored glasses when it comes to Russia, or Mr. Putin.	0
ClaimBuster	15156	the air pollution standard laws that were passed in California were passed over the objections of Governor Reagan, and this is a very well-known fact.	1
ClaimBuster	15157	This president has turned his back on the wellness of America.	0
ClaimBuster	15158	So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	15159	We are so outplayed on missiles, on cease-fires.	1
ClaimBuster	15160	... for weeks -- I've been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it's the harbor of where -- you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are.	1
ClaimBuster	15161	One size does not fit all.	0
ClaimBuster	15162	We will take out ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	15163	So I'm very honored by all of that.	0
ClaimBuster	15164	And we should make sure that we give them a pathway to citizenship.	0
ClaimBuster	15165	Both parties carry a huge blame for that on their shoulders.	1
ClaimBuster	15166	"And that's against -- my lawyers, they say, ""Don't do it."""	1
ClaimBuster	15167	(Applause) I have been in politics for twenty-five years, Margaret; I've won a lot of elections, I've lost a few, as you know, and learned from those losses.	1
ClaimBuster	15168	A president should be the same thing to all people.	0
ClaimBuster	15169	And they're proving today, every state, that they can manage them adequately.	0
ClaimBuster	15170	And under both President Nixon and Ford, monies have been impounded that would've gone to uh - cities and others to control uh - water pollution.	1
ClaimBuster	15171	And what we have to do is restrain the growth of spending.	0
ClaimBuster	15172	So this is a serious threat.	0
ClaimBuster	15173	This is the kind of policies that ultimately end up undermining our ability to fight the war on terrorism, and it will change when I'm president.	1
ClaimBuster	15174	Economic growth is the key to the future of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	15175	I don't believe in trickle-down government, I don't believe in larger taxes and larger government spending.	0
ClaimBuster	15176	The federal government is going to run it.	0
ClaimBuster	15177	And I told Mr. Gromyko we don't like their system.	1
ClaimBuster	15178	I'll bet you, you may never even have heard of them before this crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	15179	It's important we go beyond those old partisan arguments and focus on people and their future.	0
ClaimBuster	15180	Yeah, yeah, we've heard -- we've heard this before, Hillary.	1
ClaimBuster	15181	It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?	0
ClaimBuster	15182	And he ought to be proud of it, it's part of his record.	0
ClaimBuster	15183	And Iran and Iraq are now more dangerous -- Iran and North Korea are now more dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	15184	We have to be sure to maintain that.	0
ClaimBuster	15185	But who's going to get Mosul, really?	0
ClaimBuster	15186	The individual worker in the plants throughout the United States should not be a small cog in a big machine.	0
ClaimBuster	15187	Well, I think -- listen, I fully agree that one should shift tactics, and we will, in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	15188	And there we would give statutory authority to the Committee on Government Contracts, which is an effective way of getting real progress made in this area, since about one out of every four jobs is held by and is allotted by people who have government contracts.	1
ClaimBuster	15189	Mr. George Allen, the head of our information service, said that a result of our being second in space, in the sputnik in 1957, and I quote him, I believe I paraphrase him accurately.	1
ClaimBuster	15190	He believes only the right people ought to get tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	15191	But I don't agree with a lot of - most of the positions of the ACLU.	0
ClaimBuster	15192	We've expanded trade adjustment assistance.	1
ClaimBuster	15193	Ask the people in the armed forces today.	0
ClaimBuster	15194	And the last point I just want to make.	0
ClaimBuster	15195	You don't help yourself with other nations when you turn away from the global warming treaty, for instance, or when you refuse to deal at length with the United Nations.	0
ClaimBuster	15196	The other is John Neuhaus, who's one of the most distinguished arms control specialists in our country.	1
ClaimBuster	15197	You know, four years ago, I said that I'm not a perfect man and I wouldn't be a perfect president.	1
ClaimBuster	15198	And you were right then, George, when you said it was no time for partisan demagoguery.	0
ClaimBuster	15199	The fact of the matter is it was a bill that was less than you recommended, Mr. Nixon, this morning in your proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	15200	Senator McCain, in the rush to go into Iraq, said, you know what?	0
ClaimBuster	15201	I've shown I know how to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	15202	We're the second biggest state -- farming state in the country.	1
ClaimBuster	15203	Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that we'll be better off.	1
ClaimBuster	15204	That was a terrible time for our country.	0
ClaimBuster	15205	And so, of course we want to bring international pressures to bear on Russia in hopes that that will modify and eventually change their behavior.	0
ClaimBuster	15206	If you make less than $60,000 a year and you decide to invest $1,000 in a savings account, you'll get a tax credit, which means in essence that the federal government will match your $1,000 with another $1,000.	1
ClaimBuster	15207	We may have different approaches in terms of how we deal with local folks.	0
ClaimBuster	15208	We pay for it by shutting that loophole overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	15209	I don't think it's enough to come before the American people who are watching us tonight and say, well, I haven't sorted it out.	0
ClaimBuster	15210	First of all, let me sharply disagree with the President on sharing the most advanced, the most dangerous, the most important technology in America with the Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	15211	But I do think that it is important for the federal government to step up and help local school districts do some of the things they need to do.	0
ClaimBuster	15212	I want you to be very happy.	0
ClaimBuster	15213	Our recession was one of the shallowest in modern history.	1
ClaimBuster	15214	And simply to say, well, the McKinney bill will do it just doesn't do.	0
ClaimBuster	15215	But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I'm proposing.	1
ClaimBuster	15216	And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country.	0
ClaimBuster	15217	Only the United States put the sanctions on alone, and that's exactly what I'm talking about.	1
ClaimBuster	15218	And let me tell you what the record shows.	0
ClaimBuster	15219	I believe in limited government.	0
ClaimBuster	15220	First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business.	1
ClaimBuster	15221	My whole administration is about your future.	0
ClaimBuster	15222	They can't impose arbitrary lifetime limits.	1
ClaimBuster	15223	Now, when anybody has a spending program they want to spend money on at home, they say, well, let's cut money out of the Defense Dept.	0
ClaimBuster	15224	I will go very quickly.	0
ClaimBuster	15225	So, this is a very difficult situation.	0
ClaimBuster	15226	Well, I've been through this before, Mr. Gannon, as the governor of Georgia.	1
ClaimBuster	15227	Instead of squabbling and finger pointing, he gets immediate help.	0
ClaimBuster	15228	Some of these weapons have 10 megatons of explosion.	1
ClaimBuster	15229	And if we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out, then I think that we have to act and we will take them out.	0
ClaimBuster	15230	I did it for the very reasons you say.	1
ClaimBuster	15231	And smart means not diverting your attention from the real war on terror in Afghanistan against Osama bin Laden and taking if off to Iraq where the 9/11 Commission confirms there was no connection to 9/11 itself and Saddam Hussein, and where the reason for going to war was weapons of mass destruction, not the removal of Saddam Hussein.	1
ClaimBuster	15232	All I want to do, if you've already got health care, is lower your costs.	0
ClaimBuster	15233	I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so...	0
ClaimBuster	15234	Russia hasn't paid any attention to ISIS.	1
ClaimBuster	15235	We have a democracy in Portugal today.	1
ClaimBuster	15236	I am not going to roll over, as Mr. Mondale suggests, and give them something that could turn around and be used against us.	0
ClaimBuster	15237	Now, does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money, when they're making money every time you go to the pump?	0
ClaimBuster	15238	We've spent 65 years now on the development of a hybrid system, partly private, partly public, and 85% of our people have health insurance, 15% don't.	1
ClaimBuster	15239	Winds of freedom blowing around the world, Russia demilitarizing.	1
ClaimBuster	15240	But now less than a third of our people can afford to buy their own homes.	1
ClaimBuster	15241	I'll veto anything that takes money out of Social Security or Medicare for anything other than Social Security or Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	15242	I also intend to double the number of special forces so that we can do the job we need to do with respect fighting the terrorists around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	15243	I don't think you understood what was -- this was locker room talk.	0
ClaimBuster	15244	One-quarter of the surplus for important projects, and I want to send one-quarter of the surplus back to the people who pay the bills.	0
ClaimBuster	15245	The Congress of the United States appropriated six hundred and seventy-seven million dollars mare than the President was willing to use up till a week ago.	1
ClaimBuster	15246	My name wasn't even there.	1
ClaimBuster	15247	He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower.	1
ClaimBuster	15248	And without a college level job, that's just unacceptable.	0
ClaimBuster	15249	We're not going to do that in my administration.	0
ClaimBuster	15250	I've got the scars to prove it.	1
ClaimBuster	15251	These things can be done if we have the right vision and the right restraint and the right leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	15252	Today in America more minorities own a home than ever before.	1
ClaimBuster	15253	We all thought there was weapons there, Robin.	0
ClaimBuster	15254	But it requires, I think, a recognition that politics as usual, as been practiced over the last several years, is not solving the big problems here in America.	0
ClaimBuster	15255	It's a very proud moment for me.	0
ClaimBuster	15256	Let me just mention, Senator Dole voted for $900 billion in tax increases.	1
ClaimBuster	15257	I think that we have to help parents and strengthen families by dealing with the kind of inappropriate entertainment material that families are just heart sick that their children are exposed to.	0
ClaimBuster	15258	And we're going to stay engaged, as long as I'm president, working to improve things.	0
ClaimBuster	15259	I have never said we should write it into law if there is evidence that that goal cannot be achieved.	1
ClaimBuster	15260	When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened.	0
ClaimBuster	15261	They were presidents at historic times.	1
ClaimBuster	15262	I can remember the fires that swept Parker County, Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	15263	Whether or not you have the capacity to convince people to follow?	0
ClaimBuster	15264	So it I think is very important for us to let them assume more and more of the burden and for us to bring that money back here and rebuild our infrastructure, because we can only be a superpower if we are an economic superpower; and we can only be an economic superpower if we have a growing, expanding job base.	0
ClaimBuster	15265	I mean that's how our free market works.	1
ClaimBuster	15266	After all, I was a border governor for a while.	1
ClaimBuster	15267	We didn't have access to their markets.	1
ClaimBuster	15268	Jim, let me just come back on that -- on that point, which is these...	0
ClaimBuster	15269	I know we've got to encourage democracy in the marketplaces.	0
ClaimBuster	15270	And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful.	0
ClaimBuster	15271	And as I measure the words of the Bible -- and we all do; different people measure different things -- the Koran, the Torah, or, you know, Native Americans who gave me a blessing the other day had their own special sense of connectedness to a higher being.	0
ClaimBuster	15272	I felt like there needed to be a better sense of responsibility of what was going on in the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	15273	We're going to get through a very aggressive energy policy, 31/2 million more jobs in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	15274	It provides a choice of having either government insurance or private insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	15275	But let's -- let's mention -- let me mention the other one.	0
ClaimBuster	15276	No, I would make some changes.	0
ClaimBuster	15277	Middle-income families are being crushed.	0
ClaimBuster	15278	Every system that is verifiable should be placed on the table for negotiations for an agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	15279	So, the polls are interesting, but uh - I don't know how to explain the fluctuation.	0
ClaimBuster	15280	I know we have to, but this is a classic example of walking the walk and talking the talk.	0
ClaimBuster	15281	Called James Watt an excellent Secretary of the Interior?	0
ClaimBuster	15282	And it's not tax and spend economics.	0
ClaimBuster	15283	Only about half the people in this country have pension plans.	1
ClaimBuster	15284	Well, we may not always have national security issues at stake, but we have moral issues at stake.	0
ClaimBuster	15285	Mr. Bush says we are going to put the IRS on every taxpayer.	1
ClaimBuster	15286	Well, I believe in the town hall meetings; they started with my campaign in New Hampshire.	1
ClaimBuster	15287	It is going to be requiring all of us -- Democrats, Republicans, independents -- to come together and to renew a spirit of sacrifice and service and responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	15288	Well, let's admit it then.	0
ClaimBuster	15289	And they weren't part of the negotiations, and I understand that.	0
ClaimBuster	15290	I want a Supreme Court that understands because you're wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn't mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.	0
ClaimBuster	15291	All of the things that I said we would do, from inflation being down, interest rates being down, unemployment falling, all of those things we have done.	1
ClaimBuster	15292	So I would say just, you know, look at all three of us.	0
ClaimBuster	15293	I think it is important that the US stay in Europe and continue to guarantee the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	15294	But, you know, let's talk about what's really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election.	1
ClaimBuster	15295	Besides which, it is illegal, because the law of the land, passed by Congress, says that we cannot accept a treaty in which we are not equal.	1
ClaimBuster	15296	I don't think there are any villains inside government on this issue, but there's sure a lot of people who don't understand business.	0
ClaimBuster	15297	Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate.	0
ClaimBuster	15298	Perhaps in no area do we disagree more than this administration's policies on human rights.	0
ClaimBuster	15299	I know what it's like in dark times.	0
ClaimBuster	15300	They're murderers and some very bad people.	1
ClaimBuster	15301	Or, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective?	0
ClaimBuster	15302	That would be my answer to this question.	0
ClaimBuster	15303	Many of them are now the contras.	1
ClaimBuster	15304	So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it we're having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference.	1
ClaimBuster	15305	This conspiracy theory, which he's been spewing out for quite some time.	0
ClaimBuster	15306	Before even the election day, something that none of those economists had even predicted had happened, that the economy was so worsened that I was openly saying that what we had thought on the basis of our plan could have brought a balanced budget -- no, that was no longer possible.	1
ClaimBuster	15307	Bob, anybody can play with these votes.	0
ClaimBuster	15308	The rate of defense spending increase can be slowed.	0
ClaimBuster	15309	Show them by Christmas the first cut at these plans.	0
ClaimBuster	15310	We're continuing to increase manpower and equipment.	1
ClaimBuster	15311	We have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better.	0
ClaimBuster	15312	They discussed the possibility of a small training unit or having a total takeover of the training in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	15313	But I want to emphasize one point to all Americans tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	15314	I have made recommendations on that and I have discussed them previously and I will spell them out further in the campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	15315	Did you hear him say that Congress just voted to increase student loans and scholarships?	1
ClaimBuster	15316	I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a -- to a school that he's being more successful.	0
ClaimBuster	15317	Everywhere I go on the campaign trail I see moms and dads whose son or daughter may wear the uniform and they tell me about how discouraged their son or daughter may be.	1
ClaimBuster	15318	You know, Sam Rayburn once said that if two people agree on everything then only one person is doing the thinking.	1
ClaimBuster	15319	But you have no plan.	0
ClaimBuster	15320	That would not start a war.	0
ClaimBuster	15321	And I will support those reforms, and I will fund the ones that are reformed.	0
ClaimBuster	15322	Of course, we have to work together, and, of course, it's vital that we do so and help these young women who are facing such a difficult decision, with a compassion, that we'll help them with the adoptive services, with the courage to bring that child into this world and we'll help take care of it.	0
ClaimBuster	15323	And that's what concerns me.	0
ClaimBuster	15324	And we've got to create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	15325	This is a question of organizing the housing community.	0
ClaimBuster	15326	I'm not satisfied when the Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are.	1
ClaimBuster	15327	I know that you and your running mate keep saying that and I know it's a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but it's just not the case.	0
ClaimBuster	15328	I believe in the American dream.	0
ClaimBuster	15329	So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look.	0
ClaimBuster	15330	The governor has proposed skipping a generation of technology.	1
ClaimBuster	15331	And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country.	0
ClaimBuster	15332	I'm ready to sign that bill right now.	0
ClaimBuster	15333	I've been standing up to big Hollywood, big trial lawyers.	1
ClaimBuster	15334	The records show that President Roosevelt vetoed an average of fifty-five bills a year.	1
ClaimBuster	15335	He -- he -- he objects...	0
ClaimBuster	15336	Let's talk about them separately.	0
ClaimBuster	15337	If it sounds incredible that I would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant, that's because it's not true.	0
ClaimBuster	15338	We must have a great goal.	0
ClaimBuster	15339	These are very fine institutions, very fine banks.	0
ClaimBuster	15340	6 billion dollars for Pell Grants, very, very important.	1
ClaimBuster	15341	And we must extend the benefits of our own commitment to peace, to create a peaceful world.	0
ClaimBuster	15342	I remember the 2000 campaign, people said if George W. gets elected, your check will be taken away.	1
ClaimBuster	15343	I think the American people are too.	0
ClaimBuster	15344	So that's what I'll do as president.	0
ClaimBuster	15345	If they just want to keep slow dancing and talk about it and not do it, I'm not your man.	0
ClaimBuster	15346	And so will the former President, yes.	0
ClaimBuster	15347	But my job is to ask two questions, sir.	0
ClaimBuster	15348	Recently his key economic adviser was asked about why he didn't seem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college and the response was, well, you know, we can't give money to every interest group that comes along.	1
ClaimBuster	15349	And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	15350	And we honor all the service that they've provided.	1
ClaimBuster	15351	"That's why in my speech to the Congress I said: There's an ""Axis of Evil,"" Iraq, Iran and North Korea, and we're paying attention to it."	1
ClaimBuster	15352	So, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com.	0
ClaimBuster	15353	We'll have 125,000 trained by the end of December.	1
ClaimBuster	15354	It's as simple as that.	0
ClaimBuster	15355	I'm going to continue to push on this issue for the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	15356	There is uh - uh an additional factor that needs to be done and covered very - very succinctly, and that is, to make sure that we have a good relationship between management - business on the one hand, and labor, on the other.	0
ClaimBuster	15357	And what we've also done is engaged these governments in the kind of reforms that are actually going to make a difference in people's lives day to day, to make sure that their governments aren't corrupt, to make sure that they're treating women with the kind of respect and dignity that every nation that succeeds has shown and to make sure that they've got a free market system that works.	1
ClaimBuster	15358	They send it to Congress, and we have to vote it up or down.	1
ClaimBuster	15359	And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do.	1
ClaimBuster	15360	It does not put a deficit on the Treasury.	1
ClaimBuster	15361	I can just tell you, I'm a person who respects other people.	0
ClaimBuster	15362	Over 20 years in the United States Senate, I've worked with John McCain, who's sitting here, I've worked with other colleagues.	1
ClaimBuster	15363	And we estimate we can cut the average family's premium by about $2,500 per year.	1
ClaimBuster	15364	And what my worry is is that, you know, it looks like it's from Canada, and it might be from a third world.	0
ClaimBuster	15365	In 1975 he wanted to cut the budget $15 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	15366	We either have a border or we don't.	0
ClaimBuster	15367	Naval Academy, the first military graduate since uh - Eisenhower.	1
ClaimBuster	15368	Let me say again, we've had over 200 separate trade agreements in the last four years.	1
ClaimBuster	15369	I think the vast majority of Americans believe in them.	0
ClaimBuster	15370	Now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can't believe it.	1
ClaimBuster	15371	I've met with them, I know them, I've spent time in South America-speak the language, so does Senator Bentsen.	1
ClaimBuster	15372	I have fought against that as a senator.	1
ClaimBuster	15373	I would disagree with it.	0
ClaimBuster	15374	Those that can afford it are going to buy in themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	15375	Governor Engler of Michigan cut taxes 21 times, created a lot of new jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	15376	... and admirals, 21 endorsing me, 21 congressional Medal of Honor recipients.	1
ClaimBuster	15377	I've done it my entire life.	1
ClaimBuster	15378	Her science class was supposed to be for 24 students.	1
ClaimBuster	15379	Now, if won't be, General Waller would be -- you say, why do you keep picking military people.	0
ClaimBuster	15380	"Now, some people have said, ""Ah, that would make war imminent, because they would think that we could launch a first strike because we could defend against the enemy.''"	0
ClaimBuster	15381	We haven't done enough in terms of transit; we haven't done enough in terms of ports.	0
ClaimBuster	15382	I see a time when the Internet-based activities are more available in the rural areas and where the extra source of income that farm families used to have from shoe factories is replaced by an extra source of income from working in the information economy.	0
ClaimBuster	15383	I'll tell you exactly how I can do it: by reinstating what President Bush took away, which is called pay as you go.	0
ClaimBuster	15384	It's under, there's been no consideration of it, no discussion of it.	0
ClaimBuster	15385	What will be the leadership of the president in these areas to provide equality of opportunity for employment?	0
ClaimBuster	15386	Well, I understand, and Africa is important.	0
ClaimBuster	15387	I will stand with Israel if they are attacked.	0
ClaimBuster	15388	On the question of admission of Red China, only two countries in all of Africa voted with us - Liberia and the Union of South Africa.	1
ClaimBuster	15389	Kind of gets your head straight about where the taxes, year in and year out, have gotta come from.	0
ClaimBuster	15390	You've been doing this for 30 years.	1
ClaimBuster	15391	As a governor, I thought please, give me this program.	0
ClaimBuster	15392	I'm going to wait until I see that that inflation rate is going down, before I even begin to phase in the business tax cuts that I've talked about.	0
ClaimBuster	15393	We've been dealing with him; he's been dealing drugs to our kids.	1
ClaimBuster	15394	It is a very difficult environment.	0
ClaimBuster	15395	And there might be some feeling of unfairness about this because he was not here to respond.	0
ClaimBuster	15396	But I have an obligation to fight to make sure there are no failing schools.	0
ClaimBuster	15397	I told them in early '95.	1
ClaimBuster	15398	I'm used to people saying something that's not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping I'll believe it.	0
ClaimBuster	15399	Now, again this statement that somehow, I wanted to destroy it and I just changed my tune, that I am for voluntary Social Security, which would mean the ruin of it.	0
ClaimBuster	15400	I vetoed the strip-mining bill, Mr. Kraft, because it was the overwhelming consensus of knowledgeable people that that strip-mining bill would have meant the loss of literally uh - thousands of jobs, something around a hundred and forty thousand jabs.	1
ClaimBuster	15401	I oppose subsidies for ethanol because I thought it distorted the market and created inflation; Senator Obama supported those subsidies.	1
ClaimBuster	15402	Well let me say very quickly that under President Johnson, in spite of the massive investment in the Vietnam War, he turned over a balanced budget to Mr. Nixon.	1
ClaimBuster	15403	It would seem to me again that it is very difficult to blame the four Republicans for the eight Democrats' not getting a something through that particular committee.	0
ClaimBuster	15404	Seventy-five percent of the people live in the cities.	1
ClaimBuster	15405	And then if a little of it comes my way, they load it up with Christmas trees and tax increases, and I have to stand up and favor the taxpayer.	0
ClaimBuster	15406	Now, as for 20,000 new bureaucrats, as you call them, you know, the size of the federal government will go down in a Gore administration.	1
ClaimBuster	15407	And this is part of that liberal establishment, one of those liberal things that you just can't do.	0
ClaimBuster	15408	It has not worked in Iran, it has not worked in North Korea.	1
ClaimBuster	15409	That would obviously be a ridiculous thing for anyone to do who wanted to be president of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	15410	I think the greatest possibilities of our country, our dreams and our hopes, are out there just waiting for us to grab onto them.	0
ClaimBuster	15411	That's not an energy strategy for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	15412	I just think, Jim, that this is an absolutely unique period in world history.	0
ClaimBuster	15413	That's what our message is to the people watching.	0
ClaimBuster	15414	And this was August, a year ago.	1
ClaimBuster	15415	Let me answer your question and I hope it doesn't get too personal or maudlin.	0
ClaimBuster	15416	Students who are out there trying to hopefully advance their own dreams, but also this country's dreams.	0
ClaimBuster	15417	We've had dozens we've had dozens and dozens of officials in this Administration who have left under a cloud, who have left with the special prosecutor in their arm, have been indicted, convicted.	1
ClaimBuster	15418	Part of what had happened is we'd forgotten why we had gone.	0
ClaimBuster	15419	Now, for every dollar that I propose to spend on education, he spends $5 on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%.	1
ClaimBuster	15420	Going around this country, I think that I have found a great hunger in America for a spiritual revival.	0
ClaimBuster	15421	They don't give you all the details that tax returns would.	1
ClaimBuster	15422	And he continues to support a failed policy in Central America which is getting worse and worse, and which has in fact increased Cuban and Soviet influence in that region.	1
ClaimBuster	15423	My chief of staff, for instance, had two kids that were still in school.	1
ClaimBuster	15424	The average working person can't - uh - can't take advantage of that, but the - the wealthier people - uh can.	0
ClaimBuster	15425	The president rushed our nation to war without a plan to win the peace.	1
ClaimBuster	15426	And the challenges America faces right now -- look, the reason I'm in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	15427	I think everybody knows that.	0
ClaimBuster	15428	And the fact is, it's gotten pretty tough.	0
ClaimBuster	15429	So I'll take the pledge and will stay on the issues.	0
ClaimBuster	15430	But when you go to put somebody else's son or daughter into war, I think you got to be a little bit careful and you have to be sure that there's a military plan that can do this.	0
ClaimBuster	15431	A family of four making $40,000 received about $1,700 in tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	15432	I don't know if the vice president agrees with that.	0
ClaimBuster	15433	Well, I'm opposed to discrimination in any form but I don't favor creating special rights for any group.	0
ClaimBuster	15434	That's part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy.	0
ClaimBuster	15435	I think there were a lot of decisions that were bad.	0
ClaimBuster	15436	Every 12-year-old can log in on the Internet.	1
ClaimBuster	15437	And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are.	0
ClaimBuster	15438	It's really -- it's really very interesting.	0
ClaimBuster	15439	They're willing to work with us.	1
ClaimBuster	15440	if Pittsburgh does not have the money to fix the leaking water mains, it's because the Federal Government has pre-empted.	0
ClaimBuster	15441	I would suggest he start by canceling some of those new spending program that he has.	0
ClaimBuster	15442	We continue to pursue our policy of disrupting those who proliferate weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	15443	So have a lot of Americans who are facing challenges.	0
ClaimBuster	15444	I'll be glad to take a shot at it.	0
ClaimBuster	15445	It's been very strong since I've been president.	0
ClaimBuster	15446	But you make a very good point, which is that the place you put your money just makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is.	0
ClaimBuster	15447	I think these assault weapons are a problem.	0
ClaimBuster	15448	And then, on the floor of the State Senate, as he did 130 times as a state senator, he voted present.	1
ClaimBuster	15449	I was able also to get our schools ranked number one in the nation, so 100 percent of our kids would have a bright opportunity for a future.	1
ClaimBuster	15450	That's what's at stake in this election.	0
ClaimBuster	15451	There was hatred, there was divisiveness - uh people had lost faith in their government in many, many respects.	0
ClaimBuster	15452	But I'm not going to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	15453	"And he said, ""Yes, I think that's fair."""	1
ClaimBuster	15454	We're going to bring that pipeline in from Canada.	0
ClaimBuster	15455	All of which was opposed by my opponent.	1
ClaimBuster	15456	And it's blocked by the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	15457	Well, the matter of judgment is very important.	0
ClaimBuster	15458	If that isn't a liberal idea, I've never heard one.	0
ClaimBuster	15459	I'm glad to hear tonight that he does suggest that I have had some experience.	0
ClaimBuster	15460	We need to have an active and aggressive action on the part of the president, the leader of his country, to seek out every possible way to get that information which has kept the MIA families in despair and doubt, and Mr. Ford has just not done it.	1
ClaimBuster	15461	They do not pay us.	1
ClaimBuster	15462	But let's look at the other side of the coin.	0
ClaimBuster	15463	And you talk about cutting benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	15464	When we talk about preconditions -- and Henry Kissinger did say we should have contacts without preconditions -- the idea is that we do not expect to solve every problem before we initiate talks.	0
ClaimBuster	15465	That creates about 4 million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	15466	And we've got to do several things at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	15467	We've got to pay it off and build money to renew it- -spend money to renew it, and that's going to take a growing, expanding job base.	0
ClaimBuster	15468	America's going to have that kind of leadership and continue to promote principles of peace to make a world a safer place and make people in this country more confident that their future is secure.	0
ClaimBuster	15469	More land being restored since I've been the president.	1
ClaimBuster	15470	And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it.	0
ClaimBuster	15471	I do not believe that this Administration has implemented those bills which represent the will of the majority of the Congress on two occasions with vigor.	1
ClaimBuster	15472	I don't believe there's any burden, or any responsibility, that any American would not assume to protect his country, to protect our security, to advance the cause of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	15473	And one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely -- because if you read this article, there's no doubt.	1
ClaimBuster	15474	Over 150,000 Americans have died of AIDS.	1
ClaimBuster	15475	It's only on yellow here.	1
ClaimBuster	15476	I'm saying, well, this is not as tough as World War II and it's not as tough as the revolution.	0
ClaimBuster	15477	That's exactly the philosophy that we've seen in place for the last decade.	1
ClaimBuster	15478	With the Arab Spring, came a great deal of hope that there would be a change towards more moderation, and opportunity for greater participation on the part of women in public life, and in economic life in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	15479	Do you want to go first?	0
ClaimBuster	15480	I thought there was some exaggerations about the numbers.	0
ClaimBuster	15481	And so when you're running up the taxes like that, you're taxing job creators, and that's not how you keep jobs here.	0
ClaimBuster	15482	We have increased funding for AIDS.	1
ClaimBuster	15483	I want to change it.	0
ClaimBuster	15484	I want to lead a unified country.	0
ClaimBuster	15485	He's now down to a figure of five to seven billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	15486	Tonight youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to hear that my passion and my vision is to empower Americans to be able to make decisions for themselves in their own lives.	0
ClaimBuster	15487	Not willing to give up the need to do it but there may be individual components that we can't do.	0
ClaimBuster	15488	They put a plan out.	0
ClaimBuster	15489	I will not cut the benefits.	0
ClaimBuster	15490	This is a - a typical attitude that really causes havoc in people's lives, and then it's covered over by saying that our country has naturally got a 6 percent unemployment rate, or 7 percent unemployment rate and a 6 percent inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	15491	Some of my fellow governors who are real heroes to me.	0
ClaimBuster	15492	We should not uh - force our Nationalist allies to get off of them and give them to the Communists.	0
ClaimBuster	15493	Latin America is a huge opportunity for us -- time zone, language opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	15494	Look at the record of the man running for the president.	0
ClaimBuster	15495	Their Hippocratic Oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books.	1
ClaimBuster	15496	(Laughter, boos) That's my five seconds.	0
ClaimBuster	15497	I don't believe that it's in the best interest of the United States and the NATO nations to have a Communist government in NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	15498	I want to invest in our children.	0
ClaimBuster	15499	What you just heard Governor Romney said is he doesn't have different ideas.	0
ClaimBuster	15500	Look at our surgeon general, Dr. Novello.	0
ClaimBuster	15501	But the president mentioned the auto industry and that somehow I would be in favor of jobs being elsewhere.	1
ClaimBuster	15502	That's one that I haven't...	0
ClaimBuster	15503	I have a plan that will help us go out and kill and find the terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	15504	We should have -- wait one second.	0
ClaimBuster	15505	I was hoping diplomacy would work.	0
ClaimBuster	15506	We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels.	1
ClaimBuster	15507	And I favor a shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether.	0
ClaimBuster	15508	They said, let us win.	1
ClaimBuster	15509	It's not, and let me explain the difference.	0
ClaimBuster	15510	No, Bob, regrettably, we have not moved far enough along.	0
ClaimBuster	15511	The world is safer without Saddam Hussein.	0
ClaimBuster	15512	And now that the energy prices are high, I guess he's not advocating those big energy taxes right now.	1
ClaimBuster	15513	I think the American people should be the judge of that.	0
ClaimBuster	15514	And therefore, they shouldn't be treated lightly.	0
ClaimBuster	15515	We don't know what the status of the dear leader's health is today, but we know this, that the North Koreans have broken every agreement that they've entered into.	1
ClaimBuster	15516	I have great respect for women.	0
ClaimBuster	15517	I believe that we must use clean, safe nuclear power.	0
ClaimBuster	15518	The laws regarding that always were State laws.	1
ClaimBuster	15519	This is the kind of thing that would have been discussed and thoroughly evaluated well before that kind of --	0
ClaimBuster	15520	They made a breakthrough in missiles, and by nineteen sixty-one, two, and three, they will be outnumbering us in missiles.	1
ClaimBuster	15521	I suggest, in the sense of taking responsibility for your actions, we lay those papers on the table.	0
ClaimBuster	15522	I think it's the attitude.	0
ClaimBuster	15523	It's an important priority, because now is the time to act and we're going to say to our seniors, our promises we've made to you will be promises kept.	0
ClaimBuster	15524	And I made some tough decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	15525	You said that, first, we should not have a timeline in Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	15526	We got to be right 100 percent of the time here at home, and they got to be right once.	0
ClaimBuster	15527	A president should never promise more than he can deliver and a president should always deliver everything that he's promised.	0
ClaimBuster	15528	But we didn't need to rush to war without a plan to win the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	15529	I noted, for example, in reading a - uh - a - a particular discussion that Senator Kennedy had with Dave Garroway shortly after the uh - his statement about regrets, that uh - he made the statement that he felt that these particular flights uh - were ones that shouldn't have occurred right at that time, and the indication was how would Mr. Khrushchev had felt if we had uh - had a flight over the uni- how would we have felt if Mr. Khrushchev ha - uh - had a flight over the United States while uh - he was visiting here.	1
ClaimBuster	15530	There is something else about Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	15531	Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses.	0
ClaimBuster	15532	But 32 of those have given up and canceled their plans to build, and again, because Government regulations and permits, and so forth, take - make it take - more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant in the United States as it does to build one in Japan or in Western Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	15533	And what's happened over the last four years has been very, very hard for America's young people.	0
ClaimBuster	15534	They spend too much money on themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	15535	Mr. Moyers, I'm not here to debate Governor Reagan's record as Governor.	0
ClaimBuster	15536	I won't ask you, but if you do, you're in the top 1%.	0
ClaimBuster	15537	This is the administration that fought regulatory reform that is putting a lot of small businessmen and small businesswomen out of business.	1
ClaimBuster	15538	Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective.	1
ClaimBuster	15539	Well, I don't think I ran the ad.	0
ClaimBuster	15540	I uh - said that I've served this country for fourteen years.	1
ClaimBuster	15541	So from your business, helping in buying a first-time home, exempting the capital gains on the sale of the home would be the most important things that you asked about.	0
ClaimBuster	15542	But it's not good enough.	0
ClaimBuster	15543	It has to have options for loans to failing businesses, rather than the government taking over those loans.	0
ClaimBuster	15544	We've got to do something about it.	0
ClaimBuster	15545	Well, I would suggest, Mr. Vanocur, that uh - if you know the President, that was probably a facetious remark.	0
ClaimBuster	15546	We're going into debt an additional $1 billion, little more than $1 billion every working day of the year.	1
ClaimBuster	15547	We just have a different point of view.	0
ClaimBuster	15548	I have spent the last quarter century fighting for middle-class working men and women in the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	15549	And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	15550	That's why I brought the leaders to Washington a few days ago.	1
ClaimBuster	15551	I prepared to be president.	0
ClaimBuster	15552	Yeah, I'm not in favor of new pieces of legislation on -- on guns and taking guns away or making certain guns illegal.	0
ClaimBuster	15553	We'll also make sure that we have trade relations with China that work for us.	0
ClaimBuster	15554	In the Congress, in the House of Representatives, I served on the House Intelligence Committee and I worked hard to learn the subject of nuclear arms control and how we can diffuse these tensions and deal with non-proliferation and deal with the problems of terrorism and these new weapons of mass destruction.	1
ClaimBuster	15555	It's like a huge tax gap.	0
ClaimBuster	15556	But as a President of the United States, when somebody asks you about pardons, you say no comment, period.	0
ClaimBuster	15557	But what does he offer?	0
ClaimBuster	15558	He hasn't had a tough cross-examination-type press conference in over thirty days.	1
ClaimBuster	15559	That's a whole other subject, but I see we still have a little bit more time.	0
ClaimBuster	15560	And one is going to give you $122 more if you happen to be in that range of about a $20,000-a-year income.	1
ClaimBuster	15561	This country doesn't have to be in the shape that it is in.	0
ClaimBuster	15562	Mr. Harriman talked to the leaders in Yugoslavia, and I think it's accurate to say that there is no uh - prospect in their opinion, of the Soviet Union invading uh - Yugoslavia should uh - Mr. Tito pass away.	1
ClaimBuster	15563	That is not how we grow the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	15564	I think what I'd like to talk about a minute, since you're asking the question, is the General Motors issue.	0
ClaimBuster	15565	And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information.	0
ClaimBuster	15566	Take a look at Libya.	0
ClaimBuster	15567	It's cost us billions and billions of dollars for peace-keeping operations.	1
ClaimBuster	15568	It's growing more slowly this year than last year, and more slowly last year than the year before.	1
ClaimBuster	15569	I think of a young man now in this country named Villadaris, who was released from a Cuban jail.	1
ClaimBuster	15570	Now, as to my closing remarks: I've always believed that this land was placed here between the two great oceans by some divine plan.	0
ClaimBuster	15571	Well, you know, when I talked about the $87 billion, I made a mistake in how I talk about the war.	1
ClaimBuster	15572	The ones that are out there are doing well.	0
ClaimBuster	15573	And that would be a severe blow to our abilities there in the Pacific.	0
ClaimBuster	15574	We believe that we can uh do a better job in the area of crime, but that requires a tougher sentencing, mandatory certain prison sentences for those who violate our criminal laws.	0
ClaimBuster	15575	And what I'm looking for is who did it?	0
ClaimBuster	15576	They're going to do a tremendous job.	0
ClaimBuster	15577	I'll just have to tell Mr. Morton that.	0
ClaimBuster	15578	And I think we're both very lucky.	0
ClaimBuster	15579	We don't know what a qualified mortgage is yet.	0
ClaimBuster	15580	And I think those that advocated the freeze missed the point that there was a better way and that better way has resulted in a principle asymmetrical cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	15581	And believe me there are a lot of old boys in the K.G.B.	0
ClaimBuster	15582	They left the planning of the State Department in the State Department desks.	1
ClaimBuster	15583	And I'm happy to say that we've gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission.	1
ClaimBuster	15584	But it seemed to me just as an observer that you know before you'd call somebody to America, you'd have some notion what the end result might be.	0
ClaimBuster	15585	Today you've got problems in Europe, still bubbling along even though Europe's gone democracy's route.	0
ClaimBuster	15586	And I also know in a free society people, consenting adults can live the way they want to live.	1
ClaimBuster	15587	But we just have a different set of convictions about how you make America safe.	0
ClaimBuster	15588	Some of the healthy folks, healthy young kids say I'll never get sick, therefore I don't need health care right now.	0
ClaimBuster	15589	We've got to collect the taxes to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	15590	We also raised the amount of each Pell Grant.	1
ClaimBuster	15591	And the answer is to discipline both the executive branch and the congressional branch by holding the line on taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	15592	This we must get across to the world.	0
ClaimBuster	15593	And we're going to lead the way out of this economic recession across this world and economic slowdown here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	15594	We can store and reprocess spent nuclear fuel, Senator Obama, no problem.	0
ClaimBuster	15595	And Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.	1
ClaimBuster	15596	We're going to give a better prescription program.	0
ClaimBuster	15597	Prime Minister Rabin gave his life believing that that trust could be materialized, and I still think it can be.	0
ClaimBuster	15598	And here is where my opponent and I differ.	0
ClaimBuster	15599	But there are opportunities there now.	0
ClaimBuster	15600	We worked very closely with the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Great Britain, who have been the folks delivering the message to the mullahs that if you expect to be part of the world of nations, get rid of your nuclear programs.	1
ClaimBuster	15601	Senator Obama talks about the budgets I voted for.	1
ClaimBuster	15602	Some of the restrictions that have been placed by the Congress in the last couple of years.	1
ClaimBuster	15603	There's a fundamentally different vision about how we move our country forward.	0
ClaimBuster	15604	I talked to all of them to find out how serious they were about really holding Saddam Hussein accountable.	1
ClaimBuster	15605	You can look at me.	0
ClaimBuster	15606	Right now, in the United States of America, business pays the second-highest business taxes in the world, 35 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	15607	And the whole controversy about land missiles came up because we thought that the strategic nuclear weapons, the most destabilizing are the land-based.	0
ClaimBuster	15608	There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	15609	And as I pointed out in 1952, I made it very clear that as far as the Korean War was concerned, that I felt that the decision to go into the war in Korea was right and necessary.	1
ClaimBuster	15610	He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.	0
ClaimBuster	15611	I can't say it any more plainly.	0
ClaimBuster	15612	That saves manpower, and it saves equipment.	0
ClaimBuster	15613	In many instances we've made agreements, like in Vietnam, uh - that have uh - been revealed later on to our uh - embarrassment.	1
ClaimBuster	15614	And there is a connection.	0
ClaimBuster	15615	All of a sudden, they're starting to pay up.	1
ClaimBuster	15616	I can't find a job.	0
ClaimBuster	15617	And the American worker is the most productive, the most innovative.	1
ClaimBuster	15618	Uhh - I have recommended to the Congress, however - I'm sure you're familiar with this - legislation that would uhh - make it uhh - very uhh - proper in - in the right way, that the attorney general could go in and get the right for wiretapping under security cases.	0
ClaimBuster	15619	I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score.	0
ClaimBuster	15620	In addition we uh - have to expand our research and development.	0
ClaimBuster	15621	In the Balkans we have allies, NATO, ready, willing and able to go and carry a big part of the burden.	1
ClaimBuster	15622	The last time the Vice President used that phrase, I suspect he remembers it, don't you?	0
ClaimBuster	15623	We can't put the Middle East peace process on our timetable.	0
ClaimBuster	15624	And we need to do all of the things that are necessary to make it more efficient.	0
ClaimBuster	15625	I want to give robust support to the groups that are trying to overthrow Saddam Hussein, and I know there are allegations that they're too weak to do it, but that's what they said about the forces that were opposing Milosevic in Serbia, and you know, the policy of enforcing sanctions against Serbia has just resulted in a spectacular victory for democracy just in the past week, and it seems to me that having taken so long to see the sanctions work there, building upon the policy of containment that was successful over a much longer period of time against the former Soviet Union in the communist block, seems a little early to declare that we should give up on the sanctions.	1
ClaimBuster	15626	We used to be there.	1
ClaimBuster	15627	Every single one of the Joint Chiefs will testify to the fact that readiness is in an historic high.	0
ClaimBuster	15628	So we have our differences.	0
ClaimBuster	15629	After 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it.	1
ClaimBuster	15630	That's going to be up to the people, isn't it?	1
ClaimBuster	15631	I'm going to change that.	0
ClaimBuster	15632	There's just no doubt in my mind we would rue the day, had Saddam Hussein been in power.	0
ClaimBuster	15633	And I'll tell you what.	0
ClaimBuster	15634	I think that -- well, I think that's part of the need for a cultural change.	0
ClaimBuster	15635	But maybe you meant that some in the country don't have the will to fight it, but those that are out there on the front line, as you know -- you've been a strong backer of law enforcement -- really -- I just want to clear that up --have the will to fight it, and, frankly, some of them are giving their lives.	1
ClaimBuster	15636	He's parsing words, my friends.	0
ClaimBuster	15637	And if you make less than $250,000, less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see one dime's worth of tax increase.	1
ClaimBuster	15638	And everybody says they take responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	15639	It doesn't work that way.	0
ClaimBuster	15640	I'm spending my money -- not PAC money, not foreign money, my money -- to take this message to the people.	1
ClaimBuster	15641	Now the bill that the President had submitted would have provided more aid for those areas that really need it - areas like Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and the areas of West Virginia - than the ones that Senator Kennedy was supporting.	1
ClaimBuster	15642	It does involve going after them online.	0
ClaimBuster	15643	And there is a difference principle -	0
ClaimBuster	15644	What's relevant here is that tool, that discipline, that he has to live by in Arkansas, and I'd like it for the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	15645	Therefore, if we are on the mount, if we are rising, if our influence is spreading, if our prestige is spreading, then those uh - who stand now on the razor edge of decision between us or between the Communist system, wondering whether they should use the system of freedom to develop their countries or the system of Communism, they'll be persuaded to follow our example.	0
ClaimBuster	15646	We have to restore trust between communities and the police.	0
ClaimBuster	15647	This is a big question.	0
ClaimBuster	15648	The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, and we have worked hard to expand America's economic presence around the world with the biggest increase in trade with the largest new number of trade agreements in history And that's one of the reasons America is number one in auto production again.	1
ClaimBuster	15649	But we're opening the Old Post Office.	1
ClaimBuster	15650	And change for change sake isn't enough.	0
ClaimBuster	15651	So we've got to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	15652	Most of her donors have done the same thing as I do.	1
ClaimBuster	15653	I might even be willing to reduce to some degree our military emplacements in the Panama Canal Zane, but I would not relinquish practical control of the Panama Canal Zane any time in the foreseeable future.	0
ClaimBuster	15654	So their economy is in a shambles.	1
ClaimBuster	15655	That happened on this president's watch.	1
ClaimBuster	15656	Make sure your kids can go to college.	0
ClaimBuster	15657	But I do know, I do know that I oppose abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	15658	I want to be the president that gets conventional forces balance.	0
ClaimBuster	15659	So I believe that we should take a different approach to this and talk about how we stand on the issues instead of trying to characterize each other's motivations.	0
ClaimBuster	15660	Miss Loomis, I think it's very appropriate that the first question in this first debate of Campaign '80 should relate to the economy of the country, because it seems to me that the people who are watching us tonight - 221 million Americans - are truly concerned about the poor rate of performance of the American economy over the last four years.	1
ClaimBuster	15661	If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.	0
ClaimBuster	15662	Do not go to the extreme.	0
ClaimBuster	15663	You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn't afford.	0
ClaimBuster	15664	And I think we have enormous opportunity for trade.	0
ClaimBuster	15665	The programs that we've been trying where you control everything and mandate it from Washington don't work.	0
ClaimBuster	15666	Well, we can do what we did with Guatemala.	0
ClaimBuster	15667	We were faced with uh - heavy inflation, over 12 percent; we were faced with substantial unemployment.	1
ClaimBuster	15668	Uh - he had directed his uh - diplomatic relation - uh - uh - representative to yield to the Panamanians full sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone at the end of a certain period of time.	1
ClaimBuster	15669	We're going to have to develop better community transportation systems, so that with buses and light rail, we can replace the private automobile in those places where it clearly is not energy-efficient.	0
ClaimBuster	15670	I have talked of having zones in those cities that are run down, where there is a high percentage of people on welfare, and offer tax incentives.	1
ClaimBuster	15671	Now, whose fault is that?	0
ClaimBuster	15672	It works when we make sure they've got housing, like we have done in the last military budgets.	1
ClaimBuster	15673	Even the Republican platform has criticized the lack of leadership in Mr. Ford and they've criticized the foreign policy of this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	15674	This is one of the most important priorities that faces this country.	0
ClaimBuster	15675	Coast Guard cutters tied up at the dock this summer, not patrolling.	1
ClaimBuster	15676	There were too many infantrymen there, not enough heavy artillery; and certainly I don't think there was any implication in Secretary Dulles' statement that Quemoy and Matsu should not be defended in the event that they were attacked, and that attack was a preliminary to an attack on Formosa.	1
ClaimBuster	15677	of a crime a serious criminal offense, and that person is prosecuted, then, in my opinion, we are going after the person who uses the gun for the wrong reason.	0
ClaimBuster	15678	It's all happening in this administration because they cut funding and they cut interdiction.	1
ClaimBuster	15679	In the Medicare reform I talk about it says if you are a senior, you can stay in Medicare if you like it, and that's fine, but we're going to give you other choices to choose if you want to do so, just like they do the federal employees.	1
ClaimBuster	15680	But I favor public school choice, and I favor radical decentralization in giving more power to better-trained principals and teachers with parent councils to control their schools.	0
ClaimBuster	15681	Therefore I support the Brady bill which would impose a national waiting period unless and until a state did what only Virginia has done now, which is to automate its records.	1
ClaimBuster	15682	The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	15683	We feel that there must be a continued obligation to the people, the some nineteen or twenty million people in Taiwan.	0
ClaimBuster	15684	We need to have accountability.	0
ClaimBuster	15685	Because we've got -- we have presided over the largest increase -- we've got to have a new direction for this country.	0
ClaimBuster	15686	So mandatory conservation measures - yes.	0
ClaimBuster	15687	They've been prepared to defend.	1
ClaimBuster	15688	But I will promise you this with all the confidence in my heart and in the world, that I will do my best if I'm elected president, I'll work my heart out to get the big things right for the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	15689	We've been dormant too long.	0
ClaimBuster	15690	We're doing our duty to provide the funding.	0
ClaimBuster	15691	The president thinks it's more important to fight for that top 1 percent than to fight for fiscal responsibility and to fight for you.	0
ClaimBuster	15692	Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.	1
ClaimBuster	15693	That's the height of silliness...	0
ClaimBuster	15694	But Mr. Mondale seems to approve MAD -- MAD is mutual assured destruction -- meaning, if you use nuclear weapons on us, the only thing we have to keep you from doing it is that we'll kill as many people of yours as you'll kill of ours.	1
ClaimBuster	15695	We paid more military aid, more aid into Laos po- per - per person than in any country in the world and we ought to know now that Laos is moving from neutralism in the direction of the Communists.	1
ClaimBuster	15696	And as far as what Mr. Bush says, he is the person who raised taxes on the middle class after saying he wouldn't.	1
ClaimBuster	15697	Ladies and gentlemen, the president just didn't level with you right now again.	0
ClaimBuster	15698	Get the economy going, cut the capital gains rate, create more jobs and opportunities for everybody in America.	0
ClaimBuster	15699	That's what the American worker wants.	0
ClaimBuster	15700	And as we become a diverse society, we're going to have to deal with it more and more.	0
ClaimBuster	15701	First uh - let me again try to correct the record on the matter of Quemoy and Matsu.	0
ClaimBuster	15702	And I think what we have to do is convince people there is a big difference, if you vote one way you will have a Department of Education in the 21st century, if you vote the other way, you won't.	0
ClaimBuster	15703	Now, the president has never explained to America, ever, hasn't done it tonight, where does the transitional money, that $2 trillion, come from?	1
ClaimBuster	15704	I would like to have had a big, organized summit, but those people were killing each other, rapidly, innocent Arab children, innocent Israeli people, they were dying.	1
ClaimBuster	15705	But I think it's really an important issue.	0
ClaimBuster	15706	We have to do a lot of things.	0
ClaimBuster	15707	I think it's time to have a truce.	0
ClaimBuster	15708	Now, on the subject of free trade agreements.	0
ClaimBuster	15709	I've supported Headstart, I think we ought to look at it.	1
ClaimBuster	15710	Let's come back to what the president was speaking about, which is what's happening in the world and the president's statement that things are going so well.	0
ClaimBuster	15711	I think we need to have clean coal technologies.	0
ClaimBuster	15712	She and her husband made us grandparents almost a year-and-a-half ago, and yet if she'll forgive me, when she was little, she brought a record home that had some awful lyrics in it and Tipper hit the ceiling.	1
ClaimBuster	15713	Well, let me thank everybody here at the University and, Jim, thank you.	0
ClaimBuster	15714	You got two years to look for a job.	1
ClaimBuster	15715	And that's going to be particularly important in dealing not only with situations such as now occurring in Israel, but with Saddam Hussein.	0
ClaimBuster	15716	If we can get that right, then we can move in a direction not only of energy independence, but we can create 5 million new jobs all across America, including in the heartland where we can retool some of these plants to make these highly fuel-efficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels, the kinds of clean energy approaches that should be the driver of our economy for the next century.	0
ClaimBuster	15717	But perhaps the best way to keep jobs here in America and to keep this economy growing is to make sure our education system works.	0
ClaimBuster	15718	James Lee Witt of FEMA has done a really good job of working with governors during times of crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	15719	If I were dealing with politics here, the polls show the American people want this.	0
ClaimBuster	15720	And I'm not going to run up taxes, which will cost this economy jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	15721	The governor was for a nuclear freeze that would have locked in a thousand Soviet intermediate nuclear force weapons and zero for the West.	1
ClaimBuster	15722	And I'm frankly surprised you didn't pay more attention to that example.	0
ClaimBuster	15723	No, of course I haven't talked to Prime Minister Macmillan.	1
ClaimBuster	15724	We've got to put more money into preventive care.	0
ClaimBuster	15725	I said, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed with me, that it was time for us to turn our research ability to seeing if we could not find this kind of defensive weapon.	1
ClaimBuster	15726	If America shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy.	0
ClaimBuster	15727	A recent study has shown the people in the middle-class will see $4,000.00 per year in higher taxes as a result of the spending and borrowing of this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	15728	Secondly, any lasting peace is going to have to be a peace that's good for both sides.	0
ClaimBuster	15729	That's not the way we cut -- we'll cut out all the pork.	0
ClaimBuster	15730	Well, Warren would be a pretty good choice -- Warren Buffett, and I'm pleased to have his support.	0
ClaimBuster	15731	And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over.	0
ClaimBuster	15732	We have to help people succeed at home and at work.	0
ClaimBuster	15733	That's why I want a tax cut for education and child rearing, but it's got to be paid for.	0
ClaimBuster	15734	I believe that we have a great interest in the Pacific Basin.	0
ClaimBuster	15735	Right now we have a flat to deteriorating job base and where it appears to be growing, it's minimum-wage jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	15736	But I'd say, if you had to separate out, I think it's experience at this level.	0
ClaimBuster	15737	You pick your own doctor, and nobody can take that away from you.	0
ClaimBuster	15738	And so as a consequence, they're paying their premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they don't have enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance companies say that they've hit the limit.	0
ClaimBuster	15739	Now, I'm going to tell you what I really think is going to happen over time is technology is going to change the way we live for the good for the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	15740	But he wasn't in the Senate with Senator Feingold.	1
ClaimBuster	15741	We have to be able to compete in the world market.	0
ClaimBuster	15742	It's -- you've got to be consistent when you're the president.	0
ClaimBuster	15743	Restore fiscal discipline, we'll do a lot better.	0
ClaimBuster	15744	That has been where all our resources have gone.	1
ClaimBuster	15745	And drilling offshore and nuclear power are two vital elements of that.	0
ClaimBuster	15746	And the way to do that is first to recruit more teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	15747	I'm going to shut that program down, and we're going to make it clear to the world we're serious about containing nuclear proliferation.	0
ClaimBuster	15748	We are a rising nation.	1
ClaimBuster	15749	Will we have a government of secrecy that excludes the American people from participation in making basic decisions and therefore covers up mistakes and makes it possible for our government - our government - to depart from the principles of our Constitution and Bill of Rights?	0
ClaimBuster	15750	But he's talking tough medicine, and I think that's good.	0
ClaimBuster	15751	And sometimes you can't go it alone.	0
ClaimBuster	15752	And I got a long history of doing that.	1
ClaimBuster	15753	He would do for the US what he's done to Arkansas.	0
ClaimBuster	15754	There are 100,000 troops trained, police, guard, special units, border patrol.	1
ClaimBuster	15755	That is why I say that in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area.	0
ClaimBuster	15756	I have gone to church regularly all my life, and I started to here in Washington.	1
ClaimBuster	15757	I want to do something about that.	0
ClaimBuster	15758	This would not be done just on the first day.	0
ClaimBuster	15759	Well, I think we have to go to work on the problem of Third World debt and we've got to assist those Third World countries in dealing with this massive debt which they currently-which they have incurred and which is burdening them and which if we don't do something about it and assist them along with other nations around the world, we'll destroy their economies, destroy their future.	0
ClaimBuster	15760	Then the other day he says he's for it, however then we've got to pass other legislation.	1
ClaimBuster	15761	I have a realistic approach to trade.	0
ClaimBuster	15762	We're using every asset at our disposal to get Osama bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	15763	Secretary Kissinger, in his meeting with uh - Prime Minister Smith of Rhodesia, was able to convince him that it was in the best interests of whites as well as blacks in Rhodesia to find an answer for a transitional government and then a majority government.	1
ClaimBuster	15764	Well, I don't know about all these percentages that he throws out, but I do know that -- I speculate that the reason why he didn't answer your question directly as to whether my numbers were right, the facts were right about Texas ranking dead last in families with health insurance and 49th out of 50 for both children and women, is because those facts are correct.	1
ClaimBuster	15765	The world is better off without Saddam Hussein.	0
ClaimBuster	15766	When the Vice President makes a decision, that will be his decision.	0
ClaimBuster	15767	I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable.	1
ClaimBuster	15768	I've already put forward things that'll get this country working fast, some of which have been echoed here tonight--investment tax allowance, capital gains reduction, more on research and development, tax credit for first-time home buyers.	0
ClaimBuster	15769	Jim, one of the issues that I would like to close with in my statement is education, because it's an example of the overall approach that I think is important.	0
ClaimBuster	15770	He's got over $100 billion of tax cuts and incentives.	1
ClaimBuster	15771	Now, you can say that that's OK and Hillary can say that that's OK.	0
ClaimBuster	15772	First, I'd like to thank the commission and my opponents for participating in these debates and making them possible.	0
ClaimBuster	15773	But, in fact, these last 4 years have seen more weapons built, a wider and more vigorous arms race than in human history.	1
ClaimBuster	15774	If you don't grow the economy you can't get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	15775	Let me take just a minute to comment on something that Governor Carter said.	0
ClaimBuster	15776	So under these circumstances, I, therefore, strongly urge and I will strongly hold, if I have the opportunity to urge or to hold - this position: that any summit conference would be gone into only after the most careful preparation and only after Mr. Khrushchev - after his disgraceful conduct at Paris, after his disgraceful conduct at the United Nations - gave some assurance that he really wanted to sit down and talk and to accomplish something and not just to make propaganda.	0
ClaimBuster	15777	1 percent of Americans is the highest it's been since 1928.	1
ClaimBuster	15778	It would cost something like a trillion dollars to test and deploy weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	15779	Now, Senator Obama didn't mention that, along with his tax cuts, he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs.	1
ClaimBuster	15780	This means through tax reform and if necessary tax cuts that will stimulate more jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	15781	And I think Congressman Lewis' point was that we have to be careful about how we deal with our supporters.	0
ClaimBuster	15782	When you get on an airplane, your bag is X- rayed, but the cargo hold isn't X-rayed.	1
ClaimBuster	15783	I think we have to make the right and responsible choices.	0
ClaimBuster	15784	One of the good things we've gone in Texas is we have strong accountability because you can't cure unless you know.	0
ClaimBuster	15785	You said by now we'd be at 5.4 percent unemployment.	1
ClaimBuster	15786	That we are, indeed, an energy-rich nation.	1
ClaimBuster	15787	I'm going to bring them together.	0
ClaimBuster	15788	How stupid is our country?	0
ClaimBuster	15789	But we did so in a careful, thoughtful way, making certain that we knew who we were dealing with, that those forces of moderation on the ground were ones that we could work with, and we have to take the same kind of steady, thoughtful leadership when it comes to Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	15790	That is hardly throwing away a treaty and being opposed to arms limitation.	0
ClaimBuster	15791	That's the way the game's played now.	0
ClaimBuster	15792	But if you're a president, it's not.	0
ClaimBuster	15793	And anybody who thinks I'm just saying it, it will be the first bill I send to the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	15794	So we have to do two things, as I said.	0
ClaimBuster	15795	As I've seen abortions sometimes used as a birth control device, for heavens sakes.	1
ClaimBuster	15796	Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites.	0
ClaimBuster	15797	She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.	0
ClaimBuster	15798	So, we can fix this system in a comprehensive way.	0
ClaimBuster	15799	We ought to have a strategy that will build the economic and industrial base.	0
ClaimBuster	15800	He is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40-plus years who has not released his tax returns, so everything he says about charity or anything else, we can't prove it.	1
ClaimBuster	15801	I think our troops ought to be used to help overthrow the dictator when it's in our best interests.	0
ClaimBuster	15802	This is a very important topic and it's a very sensitive topic, because a lot of good people disagree on the issue.	1
ClaimBuster	15803	...the choice in this election is going to be whose promises are going to be more likely to help you in your life?	0
ClaimBuster	15804	I want to thank Governor Romney and the University of Denver for your hospitality.	0
ClaimBuster	15805	I'd like to understand who it was that did this, what the idea was behind it, why it led to the violence, thousands of guns going to Mexican drug lords.	1
ClaimBuster	15806	That was facilitated in part because we had ended the war in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	15807	More soldiers killed in June than before.	1
ClaimBuster	15808	I selected him because of his outstanding record as a Circuit Court of Appeals Judge, and I was very pleased that uh - an overwhelming Democratic United States Senate, after going into his background, came to the conclusion that he was uh - fit and should serve, and the vote in his behalf was overwhelming.	0
ClaimBuster	15809	So I will not grant amnesty to those who have come here illegally.	0
ClaimBuster	15810	I don't care if the idea comes from the other side or this side.	0
ClaimBuster	15811	And we are doing a better job of it.	0
ClaimBuster	15812	For 31/2 years, this administration avoided arms control, resisted tabling arms control proposals that had any hope of agreeing, rebuked their negotiator in 1981 when he came close to an agreement, at least in principle, on medium-range weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	15813	They went a long way toward reclaiming this election for the American people and taking their country back.	0
ClaimBuster	15814	Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs, and I know anytime we talk about entitlements, people become concerned that something's going to happen that's going to change their life for the worse.	0
ClaimBuster	15815	And, of course, Iraq is a central part in the war on terror.	0
ClaimBuster	15816	Mr. Greenspan I thought missed an opportunity to say there's a third way, and that is to get a better rate of return on the Social Security monies coming into the trust.	0
ClaimBuster	15817	I will not agree to any production restrictions -- or agreements, unless we have the ability to verify those agreements.	0
ClaimBuster	15818	Can I comment on that?	0
ClaimBuster	15819	It's balancing a budget by the year 2002.	0
ClaimBuster	15820	The present bureaucratic structure of the - of the Federal Government is a mess.	0
ClaimBuster	15821	And I'm going to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	15822	He said that he was the second most powerful man in Cuba.	1
ClaimBuster	15823	Are you working harder to put food on the table, feed your children.	0
ClaimBuster	15824	But I want to do things that haven't been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it.	0
ClaimBuster	15825	But if guilt is established, whoever is guilty we will treat with that situation then, and they will be removed.	0
ClaimBuster	15826	All of these things are presently being rectified, and I think that we are going to salvage the farmers.	0
ClaimBuster	15827	Well, we've had this discussion before.	1
ClaimBuster	15828	'Cause I'm going to bring rates down across the board for everybody, but I'm going to limit deductions and exemptions and credits, particularly for people at the high end, because I am not going to have people at the high end pay less than they're paying now.	0
ClaimBuster	15829	And I believe if we identify ourselves with that force, if we identify ourselves with it as Lincoln, as Wilson did, as Franklin Roosevelt did, if we become known as the friend of freedom, sustaining freedom, helping freedom, helping these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease, helping them build their lives, I believe in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, eventually in the Eastern Europe and the Middle East, certainly in Western Europe, we can strengthen freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	15830	Let's give every American a choice: two tax brackets, generous dividends, and, two -- and let Americans choose whether they want the -- the existing tax code or they want a new tax code.	0
ClaimBuster	15831	We have seen him insult women.	1
ClaimBuster	15832	But I've made a different bet on American workers.	0
ClaimBuster	15833	We're going to do that with an economic package.	0
ClaimBuster	15834	90 percent reductions in lead since I chaired that regulatory task force; 90 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	15835	So I gave four or five specific examples to the Congress and said, prove to me that these people could recover but we're going to eliminate frivolous lawsuits, I'll sign the bill.	1
ClaimBuster	15836	I do not think that they are.	0
ClaimBuster	15837	To the best of my knowledge he's never once suggested that a session of the Senate begin with the Pledge of Allegiance.	1
ClaimBuster	15838	"O'Neill said, ""Come on over."	1
ClaimBuster	15839	That is priority one in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	15840	The sanctions are being violated.	1
ClaimBuster	15841	The freeze people were wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	15842	The -- the fact that he only has to pay 14 percent on his taxes when a lot of you are paying much higher.	1
ClaimBuster	15843	We spent $300 billion a year defending the world.	1
ClaimBuster	15844	I want to have a strong hand when it comes to the United States in world affairs.	0
ClaimBuster	15845	Let me just give you some examples.	0
ClaimBuster	15846	It wasn't created as a welfare program.	1
ClaimBuster	15847	So when genocide is happening, when ethnic cleansing is happening somewhere around the world and we stand idly by, that diminishes us.	0
ClaimBuster	15848	If you had a line item veto you could knock out the pork.	0
ClaimBuster	15849	We guard those like the secrets of the atomic bomb, literally.	1
ClaimBuster	15850	I want to remind people listening tonight that a plan is not a litany of complaints, and a plan is not to lay out programs that you can't pay for.	0
ClaimBuster	15851	Let me just make this comment.	0
ClaimBuster	15852	We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth.	1
ClaimBuster	15853	I told the NRA that's history.	1
ClaimBuster	15854	There are some programs that are very important that are under funded.	0
ClaimBuster	15855	The record just doesn't prove that such legislation or action by a local city council is effective.	1
ClaimBuster	15856	Well, we are the ones who found those.	0
ClaimBuster	15857	In 1983, as a result of these tax preferences, he paid a little over 12 percent, 12.8 percent in taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	15858	I talked in New Orleans about a gentler and kinder nation and I have made specific proposals on education and the environment and on ethics and energy and how we do better in battling crime in our country.	1
ClaimBuster	15859	In 1980 -- or 1979, a person with a fixed income of $8,000 was $500 above the poverty line, and this maybe explains why there are the numbers still in poverty.	1
ClaimBuster	15860	Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed.	1
ClaimBuster	15861	I don't know the answer to when life begins.	0
ClaimBuster	15862	And I will not have -- I will not stand for a tax increase on small business income.	0
ClaimBuster	15863	Our goal should be, in 10 year's time, we are free of dependence on Middle Eastern oil.	0
ClaimBuster	15864	I want to continue to work after we get this NAFTA agreement ratified this coming year.	0
ClaimBuster	15865	This is a serious business.	0
ClaimBuster	15866	This has not been Mr. Oil, or Mr. Gas, or Mr. Coal.	0
ClaimBuster	15867	It had 26 separate maps they had to sign, literally thousands of delineations of who would do what on the West Bank, and I believe if the parties will get together and in a good-faith manner make that agreement, that they'll be able to do it if we cannot impose a peace on the Middle East.	1
ClaimBuster	15868	When I go one second over, it's like a big deal.	0
ClaimBuster	15869	I think we've got to have welfare reform taken to the next stage.	0
ClaimBuster	15870	My own view, by the way, is I've added to that.	0
ClaimBuster	15871	But I tell you, those workers don't feel that way.	0
ClaimBuster	15872	And that plan is to make sure that folks at the top play by a different set of rules.	0
ClaimBuster	15873	I fully understand the threat.	0
ClaimBuster	15874	But the problem of population growth is one, here, with regard to our immigration.	0
ClaimBuster	15875	You know, I suspect that, on Social Security, we've got a somewhat similar position.	0
ClaimBuster	15876	That's why we have to continue to be alert.	0
ClaimBuster	15877	People have been -- their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you've done.	0
ClaimBuster	15878	I ask you for your help.	0
ClaimBuster	15879	And that's something that I'm committed to doing as president.	0
ClaimBuster	15880	And I have put forward a many-point drug program that includes what I would do as president of the United States; in terms of doing better on interdiction; and in terms of better in the neighborhoods.	0
ClaimBuster	15881	If I had to solve all the problems that face this country and I could be granted one wish as we started down the trail to rebuild the job base, the schools and so on and so forth, I would say a strong family unit in every home, where every child is loved, nurtured, and encouraged.	0
ClaimBuster	15882	I'll tell you exactly what I think can be done.	0
ClaimBuster	15883	On the fourth of July we had a wonderful two hundredth birthday - for our great country.	1
ClaimBuster	15884	These kinds of uh - procedures, along with evacuation procedures, adequate insurance, ought to be initiated.	0
ClaimBuster	15885	When you were asked about reduced class sizes, you said class sizes don't make a difference.	1
ClaimBuster	15886	Mr. Corddry, I am well aware of the present deficiencies in the Armed Forces of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	15887	And it's time for them to get serious on it.	0
ClaimBuster	15888	And the answer is neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	15889	WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll deal with our problems, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll solve our problems.	0
ClaimBuster	15890	Because of previous agreements, their goods and products come into our country for free.	1
ClaimBuster	15891	And I'm a big proponent.	0
ClaimBuster	15892	It is going to be important for the president to be credible with Congress, important for the president to be credible with foreign nations.	0
ClaimBuster	15893	He voted 98 times to raise taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	15894	And those are the standards that I will use in nominating people to the Supreme Court of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	15895	I think you've apologized for it.	1
ClaimBuster	15896	Medicare is not getting less expensive; medical care for the elderly is getting more expensive, with greater deductibles, with fewer benefits, the kinds of things we've had under this Administration that have cut and chopped and reduced the kind of benefits that one gets under Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	15897	We shouldn't discriminate -- race, color, whatever -- life-style, disability.	0
ClaimBuster	15898	They went to Austin High School.	1
ClaimBuster	15899	Their policies so far, it seems to me, are pretty sound.	0
ClaimBuster	15900	So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact-checker.	1
ClaimBuster	15901	So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem.	1
ClaimBuster	15902	Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit.	0
ClaimBuster	15903	Look, we must improve education in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	15904	We have a government that doesn't work.	0
ClaimBuster	15905	But what we also have been able to do is position ourselves so we can start rebuilding America, and that's what my plan does.	1
ClaimBuster	15906	But I have worked hard for things like the Family and Medical Leave Law, the Brady Bill, the assault weapons ban, the program to put 100,000 police on the street.	1
ClaimBuster	15907	It's time to do it because we have run up so much debt that time is no longer our friend.	0
ClaimBuster	15908	They look at Washington and see people pointing fingers and casting blame and saying one thing and doing another.	0
ClaimBuster	15909	You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916.	1
ClaimBuster	15910	I'm not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan.	0
ClaimBuster	15911	If we don't repeal and replace -- now, it's probably going to die of its own weight.	0
ClaimBuster	15912	We've got a broad-based coalition that goes beyond party because I am going to change this country and make it better, with the help of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	15913	I might say to Mr. Perot, I can understand why you might have missed it, because there's so much fascination with trivia, but I worked out a deal with Boris Yeltsin to eliminate, get rid of entirely, the most destabilizing weapons of all, the SS-18, the intercontinental ballistic missile.	1
ClaimBuster	15914	By giving parents the tools to protect their children against cultural pollution.	0
ClaimBuster	15915	And so we just have an honest difference of opinion: I support it and he doesn't.	1
ClaimBuster	15916	H. L. Mencken said that for every problem there's a simple answer.	0
ClaimBuster	15917	I thought there should have been more troops, but you know what?	0
ClaimBuster	15918	The Senate Budget Committee did a study of the vice president's expenditures.	1
ClaimBuster	15919	I remember the world with NATO, and the world of Point Four, and the world of the Marshall Plan, and the world of the Peace Corps.	0
ClaimBuster	15920	Senator Kennedy has been hitting that point over and over again.	1
ClaimBuster	15921	If all of the unemployed today were in a single line allowing two feet for each of them, that line would reach from New York City to Los Angeles, California.	1
ClaimBuster	15922	But he, like welfare reform, I'm going to sign it but I'm going to try to change it next year.	0
ClaimBuster	15923	I think it's important and I share it.	0
ClaimBuster	15924	This really gets down to the fundamental difference in our philosophies.	0
ClaimBuster	15925	We need to encourage business.	0
ClaimBuster	15926	And that's because we structured the plan so that six million additional American families pay no taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	15927	And what's happened with some of the legislation that's been passed during the president's term, you've seen regulation become excessive, and it's hurt -- it's hurt the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	15928	And with respect to our attitude about the Iranian revolution, I was very clear about the murderous activities that had taken place and that was contrary to international law and everything that civilized people stand for.	1
ClaimBuster	15929	Just want to make sure they're safe.	0
ClaimBuster	15930	In my opinion, as we deal with this deficit, people from about $70,000 a year on down have to be dealt with very, very carefully, because they are the ones who didn't get any relief the first time around.	1
ClaimBuster	15931	See, we've got a $4 trillion debt and only in America would you have $2.8 trillion of it or 70% of it financed 5 years or less.	1
ClaimBuster	15932	That's going to change when I'm president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	15933	But I believe that's not what the American people want, and when he said, when he said at the convention, ideology doesn't matter, just competence, he was moving away from his own record, from what his passion has been over the years.	1
ClaimBuster	15934	And we've got a choice.	0
ClaimBuster	15935	Now, the president wishes that I had changed my mind.	0
ClaimBuster	15936	There are an estimated several thousand fighters in Mosul.	1
ClaimBuster	15937	Now, it is true that my friend and supporter, Warren Buffett, for example, could afford to pay a little more in taxes in order...	1
ClaimBuster	15938	And I, as you know, pushed for the debate to include the 209 American citizens who were part of it in Richmond a few days ago.	1
ClaimBuster	15939	As I said, I've worked all my life when I was in the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	15940	We've been caught up in a global slowdown.	0
ClaimBuster	15941	But we need -- Lester, we need law and order.	0
ClaimBuster	15942	I never suggested that compulsory arbitration was the solution for national emergency disputes.	1
ClaimBuster	15943	We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don't have people that know what they're doing.	1
ClaimBuster	15944	I know you do it.	0
ClaimBuster	15945	When the change of government occurred in Israel, the people of Israel were saying we don't want to abandon the peace process.	1
ClaimBuster	15946	That's not wishy-washy, and that's what I'm fighting for, you.	0
ClaimBuster	15947	One of my proudest moments was signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, that says the government has got to bend over backwards before we interfere with religious practice.	0
ClaimBuster	15948	Can I say, if I could just say a word about a woman that you didn't ask about, but my mom passed away a couple years ago, just before I was deciding to run.	1
ClaimBuster	15949	I want to compare what we're doing with what our adversaries are doing, so that by the year 1970 the United States is ahead in education, in health, in building, in homes, in economic strength.	0
ClaimBuster	15950	I'm very proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	15951	There are fewer parents of school-age children as a percentage of the voting population and there is the largest generation of students ever.	1
ClaimBuster	15952	Some people don't like the fact that I stood up to say no, but I did.	0
ClaimBuster	15953	First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	15954	Let me give you one quick example.	0
ClaimBuster	15955	I would have my Secretary of the Treasury be in touch with the financial centers not only here, but at home.	0
ClaimBuster	15956	And we're not going to change their system, and they sure better not try to change ours.	0
ClaimBuster	15957	Trying to frighten people in the voting booth.	0
ClaimBuster	15958	Over the last 10 years we've created manufacturing jobs much more rapidly than the national average.	1
ClaimBuster	15959	Senator Obama said that would be provocative.	1
ClaimBuster	15960	I wouldn't have taken any of the alternatives.	0
ClaimBuster	15961	I'd like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece.	0
ClaimBuster	15962	And we need to make it stronger.	0
ClaimBuster	15963	Let's make sure this thing's as good as we all think it is at the end of the meeting.	0
ClaimBuster	15964	I feel pretty confident tonight, but not that confident.	0
ClaimBuster	15965	All the president needs to sustain his veto of any bill is one-third plus one in either the House or the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	15966	I would like for them to look you in the eye and tell you why they have people representing foreign countries working on their campaigns.	0
ClaimBuster	15967	I don't break my promises after the election, and I don't make new promises in an election year.	0
ClaimBuster	15968	But what we don't need is to have the president keeping us from taking advantage of oil, coal and gas.	0
ClaimBuster	15969	Then I got into the Texas War on Drugs program and the big-time drug dealers got all upset.	1
ClaimBuster	15970	You've got another life involved.	0
ClaimBuster	15971	Also, there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life.	0
ClaimBuster	15972	What we were formerly so proud of - the strength of our country, its uh - moral integrity, the representation in foreign affairs of what our people are, what our Constitution stands for, has been gone.	0
ClaimBuster	15973	I must say that forty-four percent and that Soviet country is causing us a good deal of trouble tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	15974	Making sure that we are controlling our own energy, but not only the energy of today, but also the energy of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	15975	It's something you might consider.	0
ClaimBuster	15976	And these are the policies I want to bring to the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	15977	And in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if we're going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that, let's look where some of the money's going.	1
ClaimBuster	15978	We need to do better in education.	0
ClaimBuster	15979	We have got to get health coverage for those who do not have it and we've got to improve the quality for those who do with a patient's bill of rights that's real and that works, the Dingle-Norwood bill, and we have got to fill in the gaps in coverage by finally bringing parity for the treatment of mental illness, because that's been left out.	0
ClaimBuster	15980	And you cannot change positions in this war on terror if you expect to win.	0
ClaimBuster	15981	It says to American working men and women that are thrown out of work for no fault of their own that they're going to have jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	15982	So Senator Obama, who has never traveled south of our border, opposes the Colombia Free Trade Agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	15983	You talk about mixed messages.	0
ClaimBuster	15984	But then when he moved against Kuwait, I said this will not stand.	1
ClaimBuster	15985	As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be.	0
ClaimBuster	15986	I left public life on June the 11th of this year.	1
ClaimBuster	15987	I didn't say I would bring troops out in six months.	1
ClaimBuster	15988	Now, let's go back to Saddam Hussein.	0
ClaimBuster	15989	That's why we need campaign finance reform.	0
ClaimBuster	15990	We can be better if we face our future, rejoice in our strengths, face our problems, and by solving them, build a better society for our children.	0
ClaimBuster	15991	My opponent says he has a plan; it sounds familiar, because it's called the Bush plan.	0
ClaimBuster	15992	I look on this as history.	0
ClaimBuster	15993	You say we were giving mortgages to people who weren't qualified.	1
ClaimBuster	15994	These next 2 weeks we will be going full steam ahead to make sure that you get a voice and that you get your country back.	0
ClaimBuster	15995	Millions of Americans saw the results of that conflict.	1
ClaimBuster	15996	And, yes, Senator Obama calls for more troops, but what he doesn't understand, it's got to be a new strategy, the same strategy that he condemned in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	15997	So let me just tell you very quickly, we're entitled because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges, and we do it.	1
ClaimBuster	15998	Who will get hurt if we lay those papers on the table?	0
ClaimBuster	15999	We know that he promised America that he was going to build this coalition.	1
ClaimBuster	16000	He's talking about his plan to keep jobs here.	1
ClaimBuster	16001	I'm a student of history as is Senator Kennedy, incidentally; and I have found that in the history of this country we've had many great presidents.	1
ClaimBuster	16002	So I do think we need to strengthen family.	0
ClaimBuster	16003	I've reached across the aisle.	1
ClaimBuster	16004	But I think that we have to examine every agency of government and find out those that are doing their job and keep them and find out those that aren't and eliminate them and we'll have to scrub every agency of government.	0
ClaimBuster	16005	It seems to me the president, whoever the president may be, this is one of his highest responsibilities.	0
ClaimBuster	16006	I think Ross is right and that we do need some more restrictions on lobbyists.	0
ClaimBuster	16007	And that is the result of this president taking his eye off of Osama bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	16008	You have to see it to believe it.	0
ClaimBuster	16009	I served on the Small Business Committee for a long time.	1
ClaimBuster	16010	The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe.	0
ClaimBuster	16011	Homeownership rate is at an all-time high in America.	1
ClaimBuster	16012	And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.	0
ClaimBuster	16013	The report was so bad.	0
ClaimBuster	16014	Zero, because as I said in our last debate and I'll repeat, John, I exempt small businesses from the requirement for large businesses that can afford to provide health care to their employees, but are not doing it.	1
ClaimBuster	16015	We don't know who the rebels are.	1
ClaimBuster	16016	He suggested that we aid distressed areas.	1
ClaimBuster	16017	Now, maybe that explains why he hasn't fully funded the VA and the VA hospital is having trouble and veterans are complaining.	0
ClaimBuster	16018	-- because we're going to get rid of them, and the Congress will be listening to the people.	0
ClaimBuster	16019	It's a state tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	16020	Well, we have Great Britain.	1
ClaimBuster	16021	We can't get anything done.	0
ClaimBuster	16022	He's a strong, courageous leader.	0
ClaimBuster	16023	I want to say just one thing now, Ross, in fairness.	0
ClaimBuster	16024	I want to go line by line through every item in the federal budget and eliminate programs that don't work and make sure that those that do work, work better and cheaper.	0
ClaimBuster	16025	I get a 10-point spot.	0
ClaimBuster	16026	I cannot be more precise than that, because until we see what Mr. Khrushchev does and what he says uh - we cannot indicate what our plans will be.	0
ClaimBuster	16027	Let's get together on this instant check because that will really make a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	16028	One thing I've called for that has been stymied, and I'll keep on working for it, is a whole financial reform legislation.	0
ClaimBuster	16029	It's time for our nation to come together and do what's right for the people, and I think this is right for the people.	0
ClaimBuster	16030	There's too much bitterness in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	16031	But we're not going to do it in that old Democratic, liberal way of trying to build more bricks and mortars.	0
ClaimBuster	16032	We've seen uh - in many instances in recent years a minority affairs uh - section of uh Small Loan Administration, uh - Small Business Administration lend uh - a black entrepreneur just enough money to get started, and then to go bankrupt.	1
ClaimBuster	16033	Now, if you don't want to really do that I'm not your man.	0
ClaimBuster	16034	It would save a lot of money through more managed care, by giving more options, more preventative care and lowering the inflation rate and the prices we're paying providers without having the kind of big premium increases and out-of-pocket costs that the budget I vetoed would provide.	0
ClaimBuster	16035	They see 900 FBI files, private person, being gathered up by somebody in the Whitehouse.	1
ClaimBuster	16036	I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they've left, that's why ISIS formed in the first place.	1
ClaimBuster	16037	But I've not made a judgment, and I have not narrowed down a list of three or four people, among whom would be the candidate.	0
ClaimBuster	16038	We are being murdered economically because we have too many drop-outs, we have too many low birthweight babies, we have too many drug addicts as kids, we have too much violence, we are too divided by race, by income, by region.	0
ClaimBuster	16039	And so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	16040	We can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor.	0
ClaimBuster	16041	I would suggest that after Premier Kush- Khrushchev's uh - performance in the United Nations, compared with President Eisenhower's eloquent speech, that at the present time Communist prestige in the world is at an all-time low and American prestige is at an all-time high.	0
ClaimBuster	16042	Getting us to a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	16043	They went to extraordinary sick lengths, and I just found it amusing that they would take 2 or 3 cases where I was involved in lawsuits and would engage an investigator -- the lawyers would engage an investigator, which is common.	1
ClaimBuster	16044	In addition, many of the countries around the world still keep restrictions against our goads, going all the way back to the days when there was a dollar shortage.	1
ClaimBuster	16045	If we stand still here, if we appoint people to ambassadorships and positions in Washington who have a status quo outlook, who don't recognize that this is a revolutionary time, then the United States does not maintain its influence.	0
ClaimBuster	16046	It's going to be a little tougher because we're talking about very complex and difficult issues.	0
ClaimBuster	16047	You tell Tony Blair we're going alone.	0
ClaimBuster	16048	Now, I have to come back in my clothes to one thing because I am passionate about education.	0
ClaimBuster	16049	"I'm not that concerned. """	0
ClaimBuster	16050	Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not.	1
ClaimBuster	16051	One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up, and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that's been the trend line.	0
ClaimBuster	16052	Wasn't this the George Bush that supported Mr. Meese?	0
ClaimBuster	16053	I never go anywhere, it seems like, where I don't meet somebody who has benefited from a Family Leave Law.	1
ClaimBuster	16054	They didn't have the weapons, they didn't have the tanks.	1
ClaimBuster	16055	We've had great success in my own state.	1
ClaimBuster	16056	It's about the government, as I said before, pinching its pennies for a change instead of the poor taxpayer.	0
ClaimBuster	16057	And to suggest that the SALT II treaty that your negotiators negotiated was just a continuation, and based on all of the preceding efforts by two previous Presidents, is just not true.	0
ClaimBuster	16058	The president's spending, the president's borrowing will cost this nation to have to raise taxes on the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	16059	You're stuck in a time warp in many ways.	0
ClaimBuster	16060	It simply says all these states -- it made it illegal for kids to smoke.	0
ClaimBuster	16061	Now, here are the steps that I would take, first of all.	0
ClaimBuster	16062	We've seen, in this world, a development of a tremendous threat to us.	0
ClaimBuster	16063	And the take-home pay of the richest .	0
ClaimBuster	16064	They just skim off $15 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	16065	Well, you know, nailing down Senator Obama's various tax proposals is like nailing Jell-O to the wall.	0
ClaimBuster	16066	Uh - there was one example, for instance, where uh - somebody uh - produced pornographic movies.	0
ClaimBuster	16067	So we've got to really rebuild our job base.	0
ClaimBuster	16068	Anybody can have deductions up to that amount.	0
ClaimBuster	16069	But I do not want to see a military involvement on the part of our -- of our troops.	0
ClaimBuster	16070	I'm not reconsidering my position.	0
ClaimBuster	16071	I don't believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	16072	And I think it would discipline not only the Congress, which needs it, but also the executive branch.	0
ClaimBuster	16073	There are, after all, 2 million refugees now because of the problems in what was Yugoslavia, the largest number since World War II, and there may be hundreds of thousands of people who will starve or freeze to death in this winter.	1
ClaimBuster	16074	I mean, I've told people as I've traveled around, all of you that got the tax cut he promised last time, vote for him in '96 and not many hands go up.	0
ClaimBuster	16075	And the bottom line is that the United States left in humiliation, and our enemies are stronger.	1
ClaimBuster	16076	We can help people to live better lives, and at the same time save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare, and to become productive citizens again.	0
ClaimBuster	16077	... and the rest of the answer, way off the mark.	0
ClaimBuster	16078	Of course they care about them.	0
ClaimBuster	16079	And that is why we are maintaining a deterrent and trying to achieve a deterrent capacity to where no one would believe that they could start such a war and escape with limited damage.	0
ClaimBuster	16080	"If Tom DeLay or someone in the House said to me, ""Sorry, we don't have the votes,"" I'd have said, ""Then we're going to have a fight. """	0
ClaimBuster	16081	If we have a Democratic Congress next year, and a president who wants to spend an additional one hundred billion dollars a year, or maybe two hundred billion dollars a year, with more programs, we will have in my judgment, greater deficits with more spending, more dangers of inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	16082	You say that you're going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions, without naming what those loopholes and deductions are.	0
ClaimBuster	16083	And the world benefitted tremendously from the courage that they showed in those post-war years.	0
ClaimBuster	16084	We had the worst economy in a century.	1
ClaimBuster	16085	They like it because it doesn't accomplish what I think really needs to be accomplished to give the decisions back to the doctors and nurses and give you a right of appeal to somebody other than the HMO or insurance company, let you go to the nearest emergency room without having to call an HMO before you call 911, to let you see a specialist if you need to, and it has strong bipartisan support.	1
ClaimBuster	16086	We can a big share of it, but we've got to have more help from our friends abroad; and these three factors, I think, will be very helpful in reversing the gold flow which you spoke about.	0
ClaimBuster	16087	And I'm interested in what we can trust him to do and what you can trust me to do and what you can trust Mr. Perot to do for the next 4 years.	0
ClaimBuster	16088	So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is, but he has given jobs to Chinese steelworkers, not American steelworkers.	1
ClaimBuster	16089	I don't believe that's a fair measure.	0
ClaimBuster	16090	All these other countries are looking to us.	0
ClaimBuster	16091	So we've seen a deterioration in values, and one of the things that I think we should do about it in terms of cause is to instill values into the young people in our schools.	0
ClaimBuster	16092	Can we take the time --	0
ClaimBuster	16093	We have got to do much more.	0
ClaimBuster	16094	So obviously, our policy over the last eight years has not worked.	0
ClaimBuster	16095	I understand the serious consequences of committing our troops into harm's way.	0
ClaimBuster	16096	And thanks to the Congress we now have an agricultural credit bill which is helping and improving the situation with at least some of our farmers.	1
ClaimBuster	16097	The mayor up there, on the program.	0
ClaimBuster	16098	And I think the people viewing out there ought to go back and take a look at the record when he fought a balanced budget amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	16099	"""And I've looked them in the eye and I've said, ""No, I can't do that. """	1
ClaimBuster	16100	But everybody knew that those of us who voted against the freezing of COLAs did so, we did so emphatically.	0
ClaimBuster	16101	We have seen uh - the Federal Energy Agency established, for instance.	1
ClaimBuster	16102	That's really what you should be talking about, not fiction, where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	16103	But I would leave you with this thought, sir, to be quite specific in my answer to your question: that, of course, to protect the vital interests of this country, if that became impossible; if I could not, despite the very best efforts that I asked the Congress to put forward, to raise those pay and incentives and allowances, of course, I would not leave this country go undefended.	0
ClaimBuster	16104	This year the Republican Congress, as far as student loans went from 24 billion to 36 billion over the next six years.	1
ClaimBuster	16105	And so the right course for us, is working through our partners and with our own resources, to identify responsible parties within Syria, organize them, bring them together in a -- in a form of -- if not government, a form of -- of -- of council that can take the lead in Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	16106	And in November of 1975 I was the first president to order the executive branch to take action, affirmative action, through the Department of Commerce and other cabinet departments, to make certain that no American businessman or business organization should discriminate against Jews because of an Arab boycott.	1
ClaimBuster	16107	And the reality is it's not just wealthy people -- you mentioned Donald Trump.	1
ClaimBuster	16108	Now, look, we all would love to lower taxes on everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	16109	Let me give you another example of what I mean.	0
ClaimBuster	16110	Uh - very few people knew who I was.	0
ClaimBuster	16111	I agree with the Governor on athletics.	0
ClaimBuster	16112	This is obviously an area of great concern to the entire world, and to America in particular, which is to see a -- a complete change in the -- the structure and the -- the environment in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	16113	I supported a big increase in the safe and drug-free schools program.	1
ClaimBuster	16114	I'm not sure that -- and I can understand if you haven't seen this, because there's been a lot of hue and cry.	0
ClaimBuster	16115	I don't know what it would be, but if we can come up with one, I think the world will be better off.	0
ClaimBuster	16116	You can't be a superpower unless you're an economic superpower.	0
ClaimBuster	16117	One of the reasons why I think it's important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East if need be to keep the peace to be able to say to the Saddam HusseinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s of the world or the Iranians, don't dare threaten our friends.	0
ClaimBuster	16118	I talked about the principles and the issues that I think are important in a patient's bill of rights.	1
ClaimBuster	16119	But we all know, my friends, until we stabilize home values in America, we're never going to start turning around and creating jobs and fixing our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	16120	So four years ago I stood on a stage just like this one.	1
ClaimBuster	16121	Number three, cover people who are between jobs for up to six months.	0
ClaimBuster	16122	What I do is the same way that Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	16123	I remember 1973 in the depth of the uh - energy crisis when President Nixon called on the American people to make a sacrifice, to cut down on the waste of uh - gasoline, to cut down on the uh - speed of automobiles.	1
ClaimBuster	16124	These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love.	0
ClaimBuster	16125	I'm gonna make those decisions, and I won't raise taxes on the middle class to pay for my programs.	0
ClaimBuster	16126	But there are certain guidelines that must be followed, and I've just defined them.	0
ClaimBuster	16127	We've got to innovate through this America 2000 program.	0
ClaimBuster	16128	I'll tell you this, I want to do something about this.	0
ClaimBuster	16129	Well, first place, I'd like to clear up something because every 4 years, the Democrats go around and say, Republicans are going to cut Social Security and Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	16130	Not in an election year, sir.	0
ClaimBuster	16131	I do disagree with her judgment in many cases.	0
ClaimBuster	16132	I left on June 11th because I wanted the American people to know that I was willing to give up something.	1
ClaimBuster	16133	Make no mistake about it, they do have undue influence in Washington, D.C. and it makes a difference if you have a president who will fight for you.	0
ClaimBuster	16134	I think that color television is not as important as rocket thrust.	0
ClaimBuster	16135	We -- we have, with our partners in the region, we have sufficient resources to support those groups.	1
ClaimBuster	16136	I'm not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	16137	Secondly, on the question of our position in the United Nations.	0
ClaimBuster	16138	I still believe it was the right thing to do.	0
ClaimBuster	16139	But gosh to tell our kids that before they have babies, they ought to think about getting married to someone, that's a great idea.	0
ClaimBuster	16140	And no one has approached it from that matter.	0
ClaimBuster	16141	If the United States had stronger prestige and influence in Latin America it could persuade - as Franklin Roosevelt did in 1940 - the countries of Latin America to join in an economic quarantine of Castro.	1
ClaimBuster	16142	I hear it -- I hear it echoed by political opponents.	0
ClaimBuster	16143	How's it going to affect my job?	0
ClaimBuster	16144	And if you can't get there, just recognize we're all stuck with one another because nobody's going anywhere, right?	0
ClaimBuster	16145	There was no doubt in my mind that Saddam Hussein was hoping that the world would turn a blind eye.	0
ClaimBuster	16146	Some of it's said -- somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.	0
ClaimBuster	16147	Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here.	1
ClaimBuster	16148	And that's his record, and that's a matter of his record.	0
ClaimBuster	16149	But when we can -- when we have an issue that we may hand our children and our grandchildren a damaged planet, I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue.	1
ClaimBuster	16150	General Petraeus invited Senator Lindsey Graham and me to attend a ceremony where 688 brave young Americans, whose enlistment had expired, were reenlisting to stay and fight for Iraqi freedom and American freedom.	1
ClaimBuster	16151	So it will be a modern Medicare system that trusts you to make a variety of options for you.	0
ClaimBuster	16152	And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.	0
ClaimBuster	16153	I don't think we need to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	16154	I think uh - the way to get tax equity in this country is to give tax relief to the middle-income people who have an income from roughly $8 thousand up to twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars.	0
ClaimBuster	16155	Our system of government - in spite of Vietnam, Cambodia, CIA, Watergate - is still the best system of government on earth.	0
ClaimBuster	16156	Is someone going to take our check away from us and leave us destitute?''	0
ClaimBuster	16157	First of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year.	1
ClaimBuster	16158	I believe that a lot of people are skeptical about people in politics today because we have seen a time of great challenge for our country.	0
ClaimBuster	16159	So we won't make them famous.	0
ClaimBuster	16160	People are going to pour into our country.	0
ClaimBuster	16161	And not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home, and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government.	1
ClaimBuster	16162	I think that's wrong, and I think we can do better.	0
ClaimBuster	16163	I've heard of those dividends in the past; it always happens.	0
ClaimBuster	16164	Whether or not it's -- the same in domestic policy as well.	0
ClaimBuster	16165	But the Federal Government doesn't make money.	1
ClaimBuster	16166	So my argument is not with Ross Perot; it is more with Governor Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	16167	Health care, schools--one on the debt and deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	16168	We're going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling.	0
ClaimBuster	16169	Now, how -- what's -- what's the best way of fixing it?	0
ClaimBuster	16170	And to move this country forward and we're better off than we were four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	16171	Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that.	1
ClaimBuster	16172	You have the ISI, their intelligence organization, is probably the most powerful of the -- of three branches there.	1
ClaimBuster	16173	Those schools belong to you.	0
ClaimBuster	16174	Governor Clinton's program wants to tax more and spend more -- $150 billion in new taxes, spend another $220.	1
ClaimBuster	16175	We ought to love one another because united teams win and divided teams lose.	0
ClaimBuster	16176	... would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt.	1
ClaimBuster	16177	I would consider anyone in their qualifications.	0
ClaimBuster	16178	I want to see growing peace in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	16179	The center is Afghanistan, where, incidentally, there were more Americans killed last year than the year before; where the opium production is 75 percent of the world's opium production; where 40 to 60 percent of the economy of Afghanistan is based on opium; where the elections have been postponed three times.	1
ClaimBuster	16180	I've supported the President when I thought he was right on Bosnia.	1
ClaimBuster	16181	It's not accidental that the presidents of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine flew to Georgia, flew to Tbilisi, where I have spent significant amount of time with a great young president, Misha Saakashvili.	1
ClaimBuster	16182	I did a lot of work on this.	1
ClaimBuster	16183	That's kind of pathetic I have to do it -- and nobody's called me yet to come up, I might mention.	1
ClaimBuster	16184	If there's anything that's going to change America it's get the economy growing.	0
ClaimBuster	16185	We are a country of laws.	1
ClaimBuster	16186	Let me mention another regulation in Dodd-Frank.	0
ClaimBuster	16187	Today, if you're an American business, you actually get a benefit for going overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	16188	Well, I'm pleased with the results of the election.	0
ClaimBuster	16189	And the battlefield was searched, and there wasn't one single iota of evidence that any US weapons were on that battlefield.	1
ClaimBuster	16190	Are the Soviets coming out of Afghanistan?	0
ClaimBuster	16191	But we always have to stand up for democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	16192	"And when the President was asked the other day, ""What do you want to cut in the budget?"	0
ClaimBuster	16193	It will work, and when it does work, Mr. President, I know you'll congratulate me.	0
ClaimBuster	16194	I'll get him no matter what and I know how to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	16195	So, we've got to move forward with those negotiations, get the level of strategic weapons down.	0
ClaimBuster	16196	The research and development to be used primary to make the coal burning uh - be clean.	0
ClaimBuster	16197	And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem.	0
ClaimBuster	16198	We had an energy bill before the United States Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	16199	By being steadfast and resolute and strong, by keeping our word, by supporting our troops, we can achieve the peace we all want.	0
ClaimBuster	16200	Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on.	0
ClaimBuster	16201	We're going to give them tax cuts so they can spend more time with their children, maybe even take a vacation.	0
ClaimBuster	16202	That was actually mine, actually, Mr. President.	1
ClaimBuster	16203	We need to make education the number one priority in our country and treat teachers like the professionals that they are.	0
ClaimBuster	16204	So let me repeat, I do have respect for my opponent, for his family, for the justifiable pride he takes in his heritage.	0
ClaimBuster	16205	But, the fact of the matter is that this is something that we must begin it's going to take at least the first year of the new administration.	0
ClaimBuster	16206	I'm asking for your vote.	0
ClaimBuster	16207	But here's what I don't want people to forget when we're talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn't just that 20 million got insurance who didn't have it before.	1
ClaimBuster	16208	We've got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them.	0
ClaimBuster	16209	So let's have paid family leave, earned sick days.	0
ClaimBuster	16210	And our eighth graders number one in English and also in math.	1
ClaimBuster	16211	And that's not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy.	0
ClaimBuster	16212	You'll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare Advantage.	1
ClaimBuster	16213	And I know Donald's trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand: This election's really up to you.	0
ClaimBuster	16214	If you ever got close to how textbooks were selected, you wouldn't want to go back the second day.	0
ClaimBuster	16215	I'm a father of sons; I have a grandson.	1
ClaimBuster	16216	That's why I reach out to the Perot voters.	0
ClaimBuster	16217	Eleven other presidents -- six Democrats and five Republicans -- had wars, had recessions, had great difficulties; none of them lost jobs the way this president has.	1
ClaimBuster	16218	And I found myself wondering what it would be like for someone -- wondering if someone 100 years from now would be driving down that highway, and if they would see the same thing.	0
ClaimBuster	16219	I think we gave them a good opportunity - we're - I don't think we should go any further.	0
ClaimBuster	16220	So, shift from oil to coal, emphasize research and development on coal use and also on solar power, strict conservation measures, not yield every time that the special interest groups uh - put pressure on the president like uh this administration has done, and use atomic energy only as a last resort with the strictest possible safety precautions.	0
ClaimBuster	16221	And I challenge you tonight to deny that the Administration has sent at least several missions to persuade Chiang Kai-shek's withdrawal from these islands.	1
ClaimBuster	16222	We must stand for our ideals.	0
ClaimBuster	16223	We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.	0
ClaimBuster	16224	And what we need now is a president who understands how to bring these other countries together to recognize their stakes in this.	0
ClaimBuster	16225	That is absolutely proved over and over again.	0
ClaimBuster	16226	We're now about to have an agreement for status of forces in Iraq coming up.	0
ClaimBuster	16227	But I think we're all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools.	0
ClaimBuster	16228	And wait until you see what happens in the coming years.	0
ClaimBuster	16229	First of all, I think you must have some principles you believe in.	0
ClaimBuster	16230	This used to be a bipartisan issue.	0
ClaimBuster	16231	Now, how does that grab you for increasing housing?	0
ClaimBuster	16232	Ten million citizens have registered to vote.	1
ClaimBuster	16233	Our law enforcement must have every tool necessary to find and disrupt terrorists at home and abroad before they hurt us again.	0
ClaimBuster	16234	So we use diplomacy every chance we get, believe me.	0
ClaimBuster	16235	And some of those programs may not grow as much as we would like for them to, but we can establish priorities with full transparency, with full knowledge of the American people, and full consultation, not done behind closed doors and shoving earmarks in the middle of the night into programs that we don't even -- sometimes we don't even know about until months later.	0
ClaimBuster	16236	I'm for the taxpayer bill of rights.	0
ClaimBuster	16237	They have had their chance to get something done.	0
ClaimBuster	16238	I think character is a very important question.	0
ClaimBuster	16239	As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that.	0
ClaimBuster	16240	Now, the last point I'd make before...	0
ClaimBuster	16241	Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top.	1
ClaimBuster	16242	The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.	0
ClaimBuster	16243	It's a fact they did.	1
ClaimBuster	16244	Of course, it doesn't come out of the payroll tax.	1
ClaimBuster	16245	Do you know what he presented us with?	0
ClaimBuster	16246	The Rockefeller Brothers report, General Ridgway, General Gavin, the Gaither Report, various reports of Congressional committees all indicate that the relative strength of the p- United States both militarily, politically, psychologically, and scientifically and industrially - the relative strength of the so- of United States compared to that of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists together - has deteriorated in the last eight years and we should know it, and the American people should be told the facts.	1
ClaimBuster	16247	This is a president who has not been able to do what he said he'd do.	0
ClaimBuster	16248	This question of leadership keeps arising in different forms in this discussion already.	0
ClaimBuster	16249	Now, with respect to ACORN, ACORN is a community organization.	1
ClaimBuster	16250	Nine times I have raised my hand to take an oath to the Constitution, and I have never violated that oath.	1
ClaimBuster	16251	And I accept what the president has said.	0
ClaimBuster	16252	We're down at 1 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	16253	We won't wait one year or two years longer, as Governor Carter uh - indicates.	0
ClaimBuster	16254	We've got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto areas, uh - particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups, sometimes 50 or 60 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	16255	I can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you.	1
ClaimBuster	16256	Today, by his own decision, the misery index is in excess of 20%, and I think this must suggest something.	1
ClaimBuster	16257	Now as far as meeting with the Congress is concerned, during the twenty-four months that I've been the president of the United States I have averaged better than one meeting a month with responsible groups or committees of the Congress - both House and Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	16258	And I do not believe the government should be making it.	0
ClaimBuster	16259	I don't think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force.	0
ClaimBuster	16260	And we have a fundamental choice to make.	0
ClaimBuster	16261	I have a long record and the American people know me very well and that is independent and a maverick of the Senate and I'm happy to say that I've got a partner that's a good maverick along with me now.	0
ClaimBuster	16262	Is, as Mr. Nixon says, our prestige at an all-time high, as he said a week ago, and that of the Communists at an all-time low?	1
ClaimBuster	16263	The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border.	1
ClaimBuster	16264	In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back every single dime, with interest.	1
ClaimBuster	16265	It will cause the six-party talks to evaporate.	0
ClaimBuster	16266	It's my understanding that Governor Carter has indicated that uh - he approves of a $30 billion uh - expenditure by the federal government as far as education is concerned.	1
ClaimBuster	16267	But -- and I think the United States can do whatever we reasonably can.	0
ClaimBuster	16268	I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto.	1
ClaimBuster	16269	And in my administration, we're going to train the National Guard to stop it from coming across the border.	0
ClaimBuster	16270	But I hope that from here on you will no longer be saying that particular thing, which is absolutely false.	0
ClaimBuster	16271	But we got to be more aggressive.	0
ClaimBuster	16272	But two years later nobody's lost their handguns.	1
ClaimBuster	16273	But he also voted then for an amendment - which was lost, fortunately - an amendment which would have drawn a line and left out those islands and denied the p- right to the president to defend those islands if he thought that it was an attack on Formosa.	1
ClaimBuster	16274	We can do better than that.	0
ClaimBuster	16275	Now, let me mention one other thing, and that is self-deportation says let people make their own choice.	0
ClaimBuster	16276	Nobody should smoke, young or old, but particularly young people should not smoke, but my record is there.	0
ClaimBuster	16277	We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved.	0
ClaimBuster	16278	And that's a case where we need to use our influence to have countries in Africa come together and help deal with the situation.	0
ClaimBuster	16279	And I think I've had that.	0
ClaimBuster	16280	Cheryl, the president didn't find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, so he's really turned his campaign into a weapon of mass deception.	1
ClaimBuster	16281	Now I'm the senior Democrat on it.	1
ClaimBuster	16282	They're innocent victims of greed and excess on Wall Street and as well as Washington, D.C. And they're angry, and they have every reason to be angry.	0
ClaimBuster	16283	Well, this is an area where Senator McCain and I have a fundamental difference because I think the first question is whether we should have gone into the war in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	16284	I think Senator Dole and I just honestly disagree.	0
ClaimBuster	16285	I don't think we ought to join that.	0
ClaimBuster	16286	"As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called ""Lincoln."""	1
ClaimBuster	16287	Let me say first, on the President's promise for another tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	16288	We could add to jobs in the major metropolitan areas by a proposal that I recommended that would give tax incentives to business to move into the inner city and to expand or to build new plants so that they would take a plant, or expand a plant where people are, and people are currently unemployed.	0
ClaimBuster	16289	We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.	1
ClaimBuster	16290	But science, there's a lot -- there's differing opinions.	0
ClaimBuster	16291	Three, a Gallup Poll taken in February asked people in ten countries which country they thought would be first in 1970, both scientifically and militarily.	1
ClaimBuster	16292	Well just let me point this out; he voted for the resolution in 1955 which gave the president the power to use the forces of the United States to defend Formosa and the offshore islands.	1
ClaimBuster	16293	And by that I mean we're moving troops out of Korea and replacing them with more effective weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	16294	I didn't think it was a mission worthwhile.	0
ClaimBuster	16295	Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.	1
ClaimBuster	16296	There's been millions and millions of dollars of negative advertising spent distorting my views.	1
ClaimBuster	16297	Well, you know, it's hard to make people love one another.	0
ClaimBuster	16298	But the Administration and the Republican majority in the Congress has opposed any realistic aid to education.	1
ClaimBuster	16299	While the secretary of state's in one country, there are almost a hundred and fifty others that are wondering what we're gonna do next, what will be the next secret agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	16300	And this is what we did.	0
ClaimBuster	16301	What does this mean in real life?	0
ClaimBuster	16302	If we don't, the bureaucratic mess is going to continue.	0
ClaimBuster	16303	The only thing an executive order can accomplish is to ban it in federal law enforcement agencies, but I would also support a law in the Congress that would have the effect of doing the same thing.	0
ClaimBuster	16304	What if we did -- and I hope we can; we're still researching -- what if we come up with a weapon that renders those missiles obsolete?	0
ClaimBuster	16305	That's not the right answer for America.	0
ClaimBuster	16306	It's not an opinion; it's a fact.	0
ClaimBuster	16307	You want me to answer a question --	0
ClaimBuster	16308	I think, for example, if we're convinced that a Third World country that's got a lot of debt would reform itself, that the money wouldn't go into the hands of a few but would go to help people, I think it makes sense for us to use our wealth in that way, or to trade debt for valuable rain forest lands, makes that much sense, yes.	0
ClaimBuster	16309	And I think being Governor of California is probably the closest thing to the Presidency, if that's possible, of any executive job in America today - because it is the most populous state.	0
ClaimBuster	16310	We can't afford to give up that opportunity until later.	0
ClaimBuster	16311	We gave more scholarships to the Congo - this summer we offered them - than we've given to all of Africa the year before.	1
ClaimBuster	16312	There are companies that wanted to petition the administration.	0
ClaimBuster	16313	Now we're going back to when the mother's pregnant and they'll start right after they're born.	0
ClaimBuster	16314	You leave future generations with tremendous IOUs.	0
ClaimBuster	16315	I want to be judicious in its use.	0
ClaimBuster	16316	Let me just say the first -- this business about the entitlement he tried to describe about savings, you know, matching savings here and matching savings there, fully-funded it's gonna cost a whole lot of money, a lot more than we have.	0
ClaimBuster	16317	And for two years, this administration didn't talk at all to North Korea.	1
ClaimBuster	16318	It must be economic; it must be technological; above all it must be ideological.	0
ClaimBuster	16319	But in any event, no tax.	0
ClaimBuster	16320	That, too, would have to be worked out then, when you once recognize that we're talking about a life.	0
ClaimBuster	16321	But I don't confuse words with strength; and in my judgment if the summit was useful, if it would have brought us closer to peace, that rather than the lie that we told - which has been criticized by all responsible people afterwards - it would have been far better for us to follow the common diplomatic procedure of expressing regrets and then try to move on.	0
ClaimBuster	16322	They want to be free.	1
ClaimBuster	16323	She worked her way up, only had a high school education, started as a secretary, ended up being the vice president of a local bank.	1
ClaimBuster	16324	Well, I support our democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	16325	It's nice to -- one on three.	0
ClaimBuster	16326	It's about who can get the middle class in this country a bright and prosperous future and assure our kids the kind of hope and optimism they deserve.	0
ClaimBuster	16327	The President was unsuccessful; Chiang Kai-shek would not withdraw.	1
ClaimBuster	16328	That's always been a serious crime and always should be a serious crime.	0
ClaimBuster	16329	He went to Philippines in the early 80Ãâ‚¬s and commended Ferdinand Macros for his commitment to democracy.	1
ClaimBuster	16330	At the same time, as I have said earlier, we have added about nine million net new jobs in that period of time - a record never before achieved.	1
ClaimBuster	16331	Because they are low wage, low skill jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	16332	But this administration doesn't believe the way to reduce unemployment is to go to war, or to increase the number of people in the military.	0
ClaimBuster	16333	Well, I wondered, when Governor Clinton was talking to the auto workers, whether he talked about his and Senator Gore's favoring CAFE standards, fuel efficiency standards, of 40 miles per gallon.	0
ClaimBuster	16334	In my view, the policy has failed.	0
ClaimBuster	16335	And that drives our friends to the south up into our region, and we need to end those deficits as well.	0
ClaimBuster	16336	And that's what you're faced with, the parents are faced with, and the grand parents are faced with.	0
ClaimBuster	16337	There are many good ones, but I was glad he acknowledged that.	0
ClaimBuster	16338	And what I have to say about this is, many times -- and this has to do with the Philippines, also, I know there are things there in the Philippines that do not look good to us from the standpoint right now of democratic rights, but what is the alternative?	1
ClaimBuster	16339	So there are some -- some things that we've got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy.	0
ClaimBuster	16340	And Main Street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in Washington, D.C., and in the Wall Street.	1
ClaimBuster	16341	Are we building the future that this nation needs?	0
ClaimBuster	16342	I think there's a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	16343	I led for the Earl Wallop bill or formerly Dingell-Johnson.	1
ClaimBuster	16344	Our plan is better, it will take us into the future with a growing economy and healthier families.	0
ClaimBuster	16345	So, judge the man on his record not on the-lot of rumors and innuendo and trying to fool around with his name.	0
ClaimBuster	16346	Whenever we do anything that's wrong, we can express regrets.	0
ClaimBuster	16347	Under my plan, they get $1800 of tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	16348	"But I do know that if the president of the United States and the Congress of the United States and the people of the United States said, ""I believe our nation is greater than what we are now."""	0
ClaimBuster	16349	And by the way, we've also changed the culture of the FBI to have counterterrorism as its number one priority.	1
ClaimBuster	16350	Did get a 3 percent increase this year, but that's not enough.	1
ClaimBuster	16351	We're going to have to spend more money in the future on military technology and on greater mobility, greater airlift, greater sealift, the B-22 airplane.	0
ClaimBuster	16352	People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	16353	The president wants to keep them open.	1
ClaimBuster	16354	They're going to many other countries.	1
ClaimBuster	16355	I don't think it was helpful when he suggested - and I'm glad he's corrected this to an extent - that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night in the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	16356	And that's why it's so important, as we solve this short-term problem, that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led to wages and incomes for ordinary Americans to go down, the -- a health care system that is broken, energy policies that are not working, because, you know, 10 days ago, John said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.	1
ClaimBuster	16357	That's more than it's had a lot of the time in the last years.	1
ClaimBuster	16358	And America now is paying, already $120 billion, up to $200 billion before we're finished and much more probably.	1
ClaimBuster	16359	I can sometimes take myself too seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	16360	The one-man, one-vote rule, which is a very important one that uh - s- struck down the unwarranted influence in the legislature of parsley - uh populated areas of - of the states.	0
ClaimBuster	16361	No -- well, what the Vice President must not understand is we've got a hate crimes bill in Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	16362	In a discussion of our strategic arms negotiations, I said that submarines carrying missiles and airplanes carrying missiles were more conventional-type weapons, not as destabilizing as the land-based missiles, and that they were also weapons that -- or carriers -- that if they were sent out and there was a change, you could call them back before they had launched their missiles.	1
ClaimBuster	16363	You remember the last time you said that?	0
ClaimBuster	16364	But I will never turn over our national- security decisions to leaders of other countries.	0
ClaimBuster	16365	And that is one of the challenges that America faces.	0
ClaimBuster	16366	I have been for those efforts all my life.	1
ClaimBuster	16367	I will be the president and we will get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	16368	The people that are out there trying to help these kids, the programs like cities and schools, the work that Barbara Bush is doing so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty.	0
ClaimBuster	16369	I. too, believe in the voluntary military.	0
ClaimBuster	16370	Yes, I'd like to respond very much.	0
ClaimBuster	16371	We dramatically increased investment and our jobs are growing.	1
ClaimBuster	16372	Each situation is different, Robin.	0
ClaimBuster	16373	Mr. Movers, in addition to saying that this is no time for a tax cut, in view of the incipient signs of renewed inflation, in addition to calling for restraint in Federal spending, 15 months ago, I also suggested we ought to have an emergency excise tax on gasoline.	1
ClaimBuster	16374	They're between 100 and 200% capacity up and down the East Coast.	1
ClaimBuster	16375	We're not going to spend hundreds of millions on a space plane from Washington to Tokyo.	0
ClaimBuster	16376	All she had to do was stay there, and now we're going in to get it.	0
ClaimBuster	16377	So let me summarize by saying this: I'm not satisfied with what we're doing in the cold war because I believe we have to step up our activities and launch an offensive for the minds and hearts and souls of men.	0
ClaimBuster	16378	New York is being taxed for money that will then go to Detroit.	1
ClaimBuster	16379	You bet your hat we can govern because we will be in there together and we will figure out what to do, and you won't tolerate gridlock, you won't tolerate endless meandering and wandering around, and you won't tolerate non-performance.	0
ClaimBuster	16380	It's not the way America is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	16381	I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe...	0
ClaimBuster	16382	What are freedom's chances in those areas?	0
ClaimBuster	16383	Opposes an amendment to protect the flag of the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	16384	He lost 1.6 million, ladies and gentlemen.	1
ClaimBuster	16385	Every action being taken against terrorists requires court order, requires scrutiny.	0
ClaimBuster	16386	I think we've got to invest in education and training.	0
ClaimBuster	16387	He inherited a growth of 4.7 4.8 percent, now it's down to about 2.4 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	16388	Older folks, less healthy folks, what's going to end up happening is that you're going to be the only ones left in your employer-based system, your employers won't be able to afford it.	0
ClaimBuster	16389	... that's offshore back into the country.	0
ClaimBuster	16390	They understand, why can't they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership?	0
ClaimBuster	16391	Everyone who does business with the government should have the opportunity to make sure that they do not practice discrimination in their hiring.	0
ClaimBuster	16392	We've climbed the mighty mountain.	0
ClaimBuster	16393	I believe that the only unpopular measures, actually, that could be, or would be applied, would be unpopular with the government, and with those.	0
ClaimBuster	16394	The power of example is America's greatest power in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	16395	Americans are hurting tonight in a way they have not in our generation.	0
ClaimBuster	16396	He went after Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a Gold Star family, because of their religion.	1
ClaimBuster	16397	It takes a commitment to being involved and the leading.	0
ClaimBuster	16398	I think it's an issue that we need to take very seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	16399	It will mean that China no longer is involved in convincing, along with us, for Kim Jong Il to get rid of his weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	16400	They thought they were going to have peace - it brought war.	1
ClaimBuster	16401	I think if you raise taxes during a recession, you head to depression.	0
ClaimBuster	16402	I'm for Head Start and moving that up.	0
ClaimBuster	16403	The answer is to invest and grow this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	16404	Let me just give you one other example.	0
ClaimBuster	16405	It's very bad, very bad health insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	16406	And he refuses to put anything, controls, on these crazy lawsuits.	1
ClaimBuster	16407	These young people, when they get out of this wonderful university, will have difficulty finding a job.	0
ClaimBuster	16408	It will go to everybody who pays taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	16409	... of judgment, of whether or not -- of whether or not -- if the question is who is best-equipped as the next president to make good decisions about how we use our military, how we make sure that we are prepared and ready for the next conflict, then I think we can take a look at our judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	16410	And people have to decide.	0
ClaimBuster	16411	Your father was right to stand up to Joe McCarthy, you were wrong to attack my patriotism.	0
ClaimBuster	16412	The Administration tried to do it repeatedly, repeatedly in 81 82.	0
ClaimBuster	16413	So I believe that we need to control the growth of mandatory spending, back to this gentleman's question.	0
ClaimBuster	16414	Risk your troops in a war you've called a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	16415	That was Senator McCain's judgment and it was the wrong judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	16416	You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A1 great investments when they weren't.	1
ClaimBuster	16417	I've had a record of doing so in the State of Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	16418	Why are these plants being closed down?	0
ClaimBuster	16419	He wanted first uh - we know, Austria, and then he went on to the Sudetenland and then Danzig, and each time it was thought this is all that he wanted.	1
ClaimBuster	16420	"And before he rushes and says, ""You know, before you and President Obama were there,"" I think it's important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades."	1
ClaimBuster	16421	Immediately before the Kansas City convention, he added back another one point eight billion dollars in the defense budget.	1
ClaimBuster	16422	So the net cost would be 8 billion 6 years from now in a trillion-plus budget -- not very much.	1
ClaimBuster	16423	That is the closest I have ever heard the Governor of Massachusetts come to support anything having to do with nuclear, that's about as close as I've ever heard him Yes, this Savannah River plant needs to be made more safe.	0
ClaimBuster	16424	I think that's the wrong thing.	0
ClaimBuster	16425	The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission.	1
ClaimBuster	16426	But again, I repeat to my fellow citizens, the best way to protection is to stay on the offense.	0
ClaimBuster	16427	And this isn't -- this isn't going to be necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	16428	What I think troubles a lot of people in our country is that the president has just sort of described one kind of mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	16429	I do not believe we need to go back to the Mondale proposals or the Dukakis proposals of tax and spend.	0
ClaimBuster	16430	A President can't know everything, but a President has to know those things that are essential to his leadership and the enforcement of our laws.	0
ClaimBuster	16431	Now, I'll tell ya this.	0
ClaimBuster	16432	And we have uninsured people in my state.	1
ClaimBuster	16433	If they overturned it, it will go back to the states.	0
ClaimBuster	16434	And, now, I think the American people are less interested in our hurt feelings during the course of the campaign than addressing the issues that matter to them so deeply.	0
ClaimBuster	16435	Secondly, I believe that the high interest-rate policy that this Administration has followed has added about three billion dollars a year to interest on the debt - merely funding the debt - which is a burden an the taxpayers.	1
ClaimBuster	16436	There is pending now in the Congress a national hate crimes law because of James Byrd, because of Matthew Shepard, who was crucified on a split rail fence by bigots, and because of others.	1
ClaimBuster	16437	I've got a different view.	0
ClaimBuster	16438	We have a divided nation, because people like her -- and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart.	0
ClaimBuster	16439	And she has ignited our party and people all over America that have never been involved in the political process.	0
ClaimBuster	16440	Medicare -- I cast the tie-breaking vote to add 26 years to the life of Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	16441	As a matter of fact, based on the announcement this week, there will be at an annual rate of a million, eight hundred and some thousand new houses built, which is a tremendous increase over last year and a substantial increase over the earlier part of this year.	1
ClaimBuster	16442	And the effect of these economic policies is like a massive grain embargo, which has caused farm exports to drop 20 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	16443	He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching.	1
ClaimBuster	16444	And that's what is going to happen should I earn your confidence.	0
ClaimBuster	16445	We'll bring back manufacturing to America.	0
ClaimBuster	16446	For the very reason that those Senators knew, as the President of the United States knew, that you should not indicate to the Communists in advance that you're going to surrender an area that's free.	0
ClaimBuster	16447	But I'm not proud of any record, sir, I'm not.	0
ClaimBuster	16448	So I want to get some relief to middle-income families.	0
ClaimBuster	16449	So the point is with nuclear power, with wind, tide, solar, natural gas, with development of flex fuel, hybrid, clean coal technology, clean coal technology is key in the heartland of America that's hurting rather badly.	0
ClaimBuster	16450	Secondly, I believe that in the ca- that it's far better for the United States, instead of concentrating our aid, particularly in the underdeveloped world, on surplus military equipment - we poured three hundred million dollars of surplus military equipment into Laos.	1
ClaimBuster	16451	Well, Andrea, you didn't predicate that lack of economists' support for what I call a flexible freeze, because some good very good economists do support that concept.	0
ClaimBuster	16452	Let the local entity, the city, declare this particular area, based on the standards of the percentage of people on welfare, unemployed, and so forth, in that area.	0
ClaimBuster	16453	There's a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts.	0
ClaimBuster	16454	The reason that we raise concerns, not just in election years, but every year, because Republicans, once they're elected and start cutting.	0
ClaimBuster	16455	We are working with countries in the region to make sure, for example, that ships can pass through; that commerce continues.	1
ClaimBuster	16456	And I'm proposing a plan that will give tax credits and tax incentives for the rapid development of new kinds of cars and trucks and buses and factories and boilers and furnaces that don't have as much pollution, that don't burn as much energy, and that help us get out on the cutting edge of the new technologies that will create millions of new jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	16457	We need to cover more kids.	0
ClaimBuster	16458	We will kill bin Laden; we will crush Al Qaida.	0
ClaimBuster	16459	We have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.	0
ClaimBuster	16460	They're going to be put to death.	1
ClaimBuster	16461	You know, and everybody's ducking it so I'm gonna say it, that we are not letting that surplus stay in the bank.	0
ClaimBuster	16462	Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important.	0
ClaimBuster	16463	And also, I'm going to institute zero-based budgeting which I used four years in Georgia, which uh - assesses every program every year, and eliminates those programs that are obsolete or obsolescent.	1
ClaimBuster	16464	I may not be for your version, Mr. Vice President, but I'm for what I just described to the lady.	0
ClaimBuster	16465	But that's what I feel.	0
ClaimBuster	16466	So I'll just keep saying, I am one.	0
ClaimBuster	16467	I think that the American people also need to be a little more responsible and think about whether there's a connection with their lives and what we do in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	16468	Well, I don't believe it would be appropriate for a president to suggest that the banking system is not sound.	0
ClaimBuster	16469	My opponent said that America must pass a global test before we used force to protect ourselves.	1
ClaimBuster	16470	And I believe we've got the results to show we're on the right track.	0
ClaimBuster	16471	He said nice things about me.	1
ClaimBuster	16472	And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.	0
ClaimBuster	16473	Well, the invasion of Afghanistan didn't take place on our watch.	1
ClaimBuster	16474	And I have not made it an issue, nor should it be.	0
ClaimBuster	16475	After he fired James Schlesinger, the political heat got so great that he added back about $3 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	16476	A mission that doesn't try to be all things to all people.	0
ClaimBuster	16477	Let me simply say that I think it has to be the woman in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs that makes that decision, and I think that's the right approach, the right decision, and I would hope by this time that Mr. Bush had sorted out this issue and come to terms with it as I have.	0
ClaimBuster	16478	And that means 98 percent of American families, 97 percent of small businesses, they will not see a tax increase.	1
ClaimBuster	16479	And I think to answer your question, I think both of us care a lot about the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	16480	"By the way, when Senator Obama said he would unilaterally renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Canadians said, ""Yes, and we'll sell our oil to China."""	1
ClaimBuster	16481	We don't need as much manpower on the Korean Peninsula to keep a deterrent.	0
ClaimBuster	16482	And so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity; that our schools are working; that if there's violence on the streets, that working with faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of control.	0
ClaimBuster	16483	We have to protect our capacity to push forward what America's all about.	0
ClaimBuster	16484	And my opponent was unwilling to support that action.	0
ClaimBuster	16485	The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do.	0
ClaimBuster	16486	There ought to be a clear, unequivocal commitment without change to Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	16487	I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing.	0
ClaimBuster	16488	She's lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the FBI.	1
ClaimBuster	16489	Look, I fully recognize I'm not of Washington.	1
ClaimBuster	16490	They have the bargain of the century.	0
ClaimBuster	16491	And, in fact, an across-the-board spending freeze is a hatchet, and we do need a scalpel, because there are some programs that don't work at all.	0
ClaimBuster	16492	But not a one of those key democratic leaders support our policy in Central America.	1
ClaimBuster	16493	Those decisions generally -- generally are not poll-tested.	1
ClaimBuster	16494	That's what this election is about.	0
ClaimBuster	16495	This is a serious issue, and I think we ought to understand completely if we disagree, and if so, where.	0
ClaimBuster	16496	They're very important parts of the safety net of health care.	0
ClaimBuster	16497	And, you know, yes, have we had some fights between me and the Republicans when -- when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of Wall Street?	1
ClaimBuster	16498	They've got people allowed to go into churches now and political meetings without any showing of potential criminal activity or otherwise.	0
ClaimBuster	16499	Legislators make law; judges interpret the Constitution.	1
ClaimBuster	16500	A minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement, because he believes his faith instructs him to do that, I admire.	0
ClaimBuster	16501	So let me talk about my 30 years in public service.	0
ClaimBuster	16502	They ought to be engaged in making high speed rail.	0
ClaimBuster	16503	And I specifically would like to know whether Governor Bush will support the Dingle-Norwood bill, which is the main one pending.	1
ClaimBuster	16504	I started with a $1 million loan.	1
ClaimBuster	16505	I just have an honest philosophical difference.	0
ClaimBuster	16506	I do believe that we need to control mandatory spending.	0
ClaimBuster	16507	No, I am confident about the American economy.	0
ClaimBuster	16508	But let's go back to the original point.	0
ClaimBuster	16509	Well, I actually agree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	16510	We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.	0
ClaimBuster	16511	We are never going to fix it by the parties, because Democrats want a better advantage for themselves, we want a better advantage as Republicans, and that's not how it's going to work.	0
ClaimBuster	16512	China has finally agreed to stop sending us products made with prison labor.	1
ClaimBuster	16513	If they do, they're make-work jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	16514	Then finally, our government passes laws and freezes the plan in concrete.	1
ClaimBuster	16515	And so it's a combination of these things.	0
ClaimBuster	16516	They are members of NATO.	1
ClaimBuster	16517	I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.	0
ClaimBuster	16518	I've thought a lot about what it means to be the president.	0
ClaimBuster	16519	We're weak in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	16520	That was a mistake as well, and it cost thousands of jobs for American workers in the Midwest and all over the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	16521	Now, there are all kinds of good ideas, brilliant ideas, terrific ideas on health care.	0
ClaimBuster	16522	I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy.	1
ClaimBuster	16523	I built a massive company, a great company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, worth many, many billions of dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	16524	Now all you got that tax cut, congratulations.	0
ClaimBuster	16525	I don't know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great -- I'm very proud of my children.	0
ClaimBuster	16526	I mean, look at the facts.	0
ClaimBuster	16527	I'll give you an example.	0
ClaimBuster	16528	It's destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses.	0
ClaimBuster	16529	There's much we can do with them with respect to homeland security.	0
ClaimBuster	16530	There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.	1
ClaimBuster	16531	If you get grassroots America excited about it, and if they tap Congress on the shoulder and say do it, Charlie, it'll happen.	0
ClaimBuster	16532	You know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things.	0
ClaimBuster	16533	Whether or not it was a clear understanding as to what the mission would be.	0
ClaimBuster	16534	Did anybody go out and ask the people, how are you going to pay the extra money?	0
ClaimBuster	16535	That will reduce medical errors and reduce costs.	1
ClaimBuster	16536	Let me tell you what we have done.	0
ClaimBuster	16537	It would be very disturbing to American people.	0
ClaimBuster	16538	I don't want to send troops any place.	0
ClaimBuster	16539	But I'll tell you this: As president, I'll never take my eye off that ball.	0
ClaimBuster	16540	And incidentally if Senator Kennedy disagrees, he should indicate where he believes those policies are different from those he's advocating today.	0
ClaimBuster	16541	Well - we now have such uh - a low utilization of uh - our productive capacity - uh about 73 percent; I think it's about the lowest since the Great Depression years - and such a high unemployment rate now - uh 7.9 percent - that - uh we have a long way to go in getting people to work before we have the inflationary pressures.	1
ClaimBuster	16542	It's how we're going to grow this economy over the long term.	0
ClaimBuster	16543	They'll have more than Great Britain sometime in the -- in the relatively near future.	0
ClaimBuster	16544	But the deterrent -- and that's what it is for -- is also what led me to propose what is now being called the Star Wars concept, but propose that we research to see if there isn't a defensive weapon that could defend against incoming missiles.	0
ClaimBuster	16545	So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare.	0
ClaimBuster	16546	Do we need to fix it, particularly for OGBYNs (sic) and for brain surgeons and others?	0
ClaimBuster	16547	But we do need to make sure that as we -- as we send support for them, that this is tied to them making progress on -- on matters that would lead them to becoming a civil society.	0
ClaimBuster	16548	That's really what you're -- when they ask about the mistakes, that's what they're talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	16549	It wasn't until we had a Republican Congress you even thought about, you talked about tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	16550	This probably has more to do with our economic future than anything and that means it also has a national security implication, because there's never been a nation on earth that saw its economy decline and continued to maintain its primacy as a military power.	1
ClaimBuster	16551	Even President Nixon, because he was a strong leader at least, worked with a Democratic Congress very well.	1
ClaimBuster	16552	I fought hard from my days in the Senate and as vice president to cut the welfare rolls and we've moved millions of people in America into good jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	16553	This is a invasion of drugs from all over the world.	0
ClaimBuster	16554	But I believe it would have been much more unfair to have had John Anderson denied the right to participate in this debate.	1
ClaimBuster	16555	I have a direct relationship with hundreds of people around - hundreds of thousands around the country who actively campaign for me.	1
ClaimBuster	16556	First of all, I think it's important for Governor Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	16557	You've already spent $45 million scaring seniors and tearing me apart.	1
ClaimBuster	16558	I know that I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for the fact that this country gave me opportunity.	0
ClaimBuster	16559	I know the President's supposed to be replying to me, but sometimes, I have a hard time in connecting what he's saying, with what I have said or what my positions are.	0
ClaimBuster	16560	You thought it should have been 5,000 troops...	1
ClaimBuster	16561	Well, Jim, I believe that the Federal government should give people the tools and try to establish the conditions in which they can make the most of their own lives.	0
ClaimBuster	16562	That's not true in Connecticut, family income is down.	1
ClaimBuster	16563	4th in manufacturing jobs, 4th in the reduction of poverty, 4th in income increase.	1
ClaimBuster	16564	Uh - those uh programs were designed to help those who need it most.	0
ClaimBuster	16565	So my view is, sir, you have to increase investment, grow the economy and reduce the deficit by controlling health care costs, prudent reductions in defense, cuts in domestic programs and asking the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their fair share of taxes and investing and growing this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	16566	There are two very different issues here, and they've got to be dealt with separately.	0
ClaimBuster	16567	Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.	0
ClaimBuster	16568	The only people affected by my plan are the top income earners of America.	1
ClaimBuster	16569	When I was that far ahead, it was immediately following the Democratic Convention, and before the Republican Convention.	0
ClaimBuster	16570	I spent my life in the private sector.	1
ClaimBuster	16571	There is no policy of this government to give to the People's Republic, or to sell to the People's Republic of China, military equipment.	1
ClaimBuster	16572	The unemployment rate was less than 4 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	16573	We need a president who will lead on this issue, who has had experience on this issue.	0
ClaimBuster	16574	I vetoed it when they shut the government down.	1
ClaimBuster	16575	You didn't even have tax cuts in your budget, Mr. President, the first two years you were president.	1
ClaimBuster	16576	So we've got to get our education system right.	0
ClaimBuster	16577	Nobody touched that tar baby till the day after election in 1988 because they were flooding both parties with crooked PAC money, and it was in many cases stolen PAC money.	1
ClaimBuster	16578	Here they're leaving the skies and the environment behind.	0
ClaimBuster	16579	Yes, I voted for it, supported it.	1
ClaimBuster	16580	The African-American community -- because -- look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated.	0
ClaimBuster	16581	Let me just make it clear: I will never allow any country to have a veto over our security.	0
ClaimBuster	16582	We're now at under 285.	1
ClaimBuster	16583	And I want to tell you, they hate the Clintons, because what's happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace.	0
ClaimBuster	16584	And I think it's very important for the American president, as well as other Western leaders, to remind him of the great benefits of democracy, that democracy will best help the people realize their hopes and aspirations and dreams.	0
ClaimBuster	16585	It seems like they can't get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	16586	Is the senior citizen better off because inflation is not wiping out their family's savings?	0
ClaimBuster	16587	And it's an overall sign of weakness.	0
ClaimBuster	16588	We are going to areas like Syria where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama.	1
ClaimBuster	16589	The Secretary of State admitted that this morning.	1
ClaimBuster	16590	The Soviet Union does understand strength.	0
ClaimBuster	16591	The democratic leaders of Central and Latin America want to work with us.	0
ClaimBuster	16592	American airplanes are helping today on humanitarian relief for Sarajevo.	1
ClaimBuster	16593	And I've noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born.	0
ClaimBuster	16594	This would take a lot of negotiation.	0
ClaimBuster	16595	Now, it ultimately is going to be up to the voters -- to you -- which path we should take.	0
ClaimBuster	16596	The same way the computer was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to figure out, for defense purposes, how to communicate, we've got to understand that this is a national security issue, as well.	1
ClaimBuster	16597	They are a tough and a ruthless adversary, and we must be prepared to meet that challenge, and I would.	0
ClaimBuster	16598	I have further strongly recommended that this administration do something it has not done, and that is to strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen the officials in this government that deal with undocumented workers, and to do so in a way that's responsible and within the Constitution of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	16599	I wanted a government that was smaller and less bureaucratic to help people make the most of their own lives.	0
ClaimBuster	16600	And I would come up with a game plan to deal with it.	0
ClaimBuster	16601	We need to do more than that.	0
ClaimBuster	16602	Senator Obama said the surge could not work, said it would increase sectarian violence, said it was doomed to failure.	1
ClaimBuster	16603	Well, I think Donald was about to say he's going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act.	0
ClaimBuster	16604	And the point that I originally made is that we took our eye off Afghanistan, we took our eye off the folks who perpetrated 9/11, they are still sending out videotapes and Senator McCain, nobody is talking about defeat in Iraq, but I have to say we are having enormous problems in Afghanistan because of that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	16605	This war is a long, long war, and it requires steadfast determination and it requires a complete understanding that we not only chase down Al Qaida but we disrupt terrorist safe havens as well as people who could provide the terrorists with support.	0
ClaimBuster	16606	I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors.	0
ClaimBuster	16607	You have to allow people to transfer property, which is why I'm for partnership rights and so forth.	0
ClaimBuster	16608	We need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet.	0
ClaimBuster	16609	It's who makes the decision, who makes this very difficult, very wrenching decision?	0
ClaimBuster	16610	I was on my peroration.	0
ClaimBuster	16611	That's not fair for our future.	0
ClaimBuster	16612	I've served under a number of presidents.	1
ClaimBuster	16613	He misled the American people when he said we'd go to war as a last resort.	0
ClaimBuster	16614	And we formed a historic coalition, and we brought him down, and we destroyed the 4th largest army.	1
ClaimBuster	16615	And you know why he gets that count?	0
ClaimBuster	16616	So we've got to get it under control and there's one last point I'd make.	0
ClaimBuster	16617	But it will cover preexisting conditions.	1
ClaimBuster	16618	And we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it.	1
ClaimBuster	16619	We're starting to see gains in math and science.	1
ClaimBuster	16620	And as Americans, our generation should protect this wonderful land for our children.	0
ClaimBuster	16621	Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.	0
ClaimBuster	16622	Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS.	1
ClaimBuster	16623	The oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare.	1
ClaimBuster	16624	But the important thing is, what are we going to do now.	0
ClaimBuster	16625	It's been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.	1
ClaimBuster	16626	I want to end the tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and provide a tax credit for every company that's creating a job right here in America.	0
ClaimBuster	16627	The government needs to be well-managed, efficient, economical, We need to have a government that's sensitive to our people's needs - to those who are poor, who don't have adequate health care, who have been cheated too long with our tax programs, who've been out of jobs, whose families have been torn apart.	0
ClaimBuster	16628	I think, to close out this discussion, it would be better to put into perspective what we're talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	16629	It - it was a very uh - because of the defeat of teacher salaries, it was not a bill that uh - met in my opinion the need.	0
ClaimBuster	16630	[Laughter] And yet, that's the most important single issue of our time.	0
ClaimBuster	16631	The intelligence-gathering and the law-enforcement arms of the FBI just couldn't share intelligence under the old law.	1
ClaimBuster	16632	And any objective observer has said it's not true.	0
ClaimBuster	16633	I see what it does.	0
ClaimBuster	16634	The right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective?	0
ClaimBuster	16635	I want a country where people are coming together across the lines of race and region and income.	0
ClaimBuster	16636	I don't believe we should move to a cold-war relationship.	0
ClaimBuster	16637	These are the kinds of efforts worked on a joint basis with community leaders, particularly in the minority areas of the central cities that have been deteriorating so rapidly in the past.	0
ClaimBuster	16638	The good news is (inaudible).	0
ClaimBuster	16639	I think also that pulling our missile defense program out of Poland in the way we did was also unfortunate in terms of, if you will, disrupting the relationship in some ways that existed between us.	0
ClaimBuster	16640	The tax increase I have proposed triggers in at family incomes of $200,000 and above.	1
ClaimBuster	16641	The Soviets take out more than we do and the principle of intrusive verification.	0
ClaimBuster	16642	There's no question about that.	0
ClaimBuster	16643	In that interview uh - Governor Carter indicated that uh - he would raise the taxes on those in the medium or middle-income brackets or higher.	1
ClaimBuster	16644	On the other hand we found that the bill got into the legislative difficulties and consequently no action was taken.	1
ClaimBuster	16645	Are we better off when we load our children with this fantastic debt?	0
ClaimBuster	16646	This was a trick on the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	16647	Yes, we have to be steadfast and resolved, and I am.	0
ClaimBuster	16648	It's about selecting a president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	16649	Now it's true that we disagree on this.	1
ClaimBuster	16650	Are you for what the Supreme Court says is a constitutional way of having affirmative action?	0
ClaimBuster	16651	Probably never heard of him.	0
ClaimBuster	16652	When you go to bed tonight, look at your children.	0
ClaimBuster	16653	So, what -- what we need to do with respect to the Middle East is strong, steady leadership, not wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map.	0
ClaimBuster	16654	They oppose mine because they don't want to get Medicare involved because they're afraid that Medicare will negotiate lower prices for seniors who currently pay the highest prices of all.	1
ClaimBuster	16655	Thank you for your question.	0
ClaimBuster	16656	We had a better idea.	0
ClaimBuster	16657	Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they don't pass it: Is the program so critical it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it?	0
ClaimBuster	16658	We came from 100 different corners of the earth.	0
ClaimBuster	16659	So across the board, we are engaging them in building capacity in these countries.	0
ClaimBuster	16660	All of those things will make a difference, so the point is the commitments I've made, I've kept.	1
ClaimBuster	16661	Let's try to expand our markets abroad.	0
ClaimBuster	16662	"We've got to show that we've got good habits, because if we're running up trillion dollar debts that we're passing on to the next generation, then a lot of people are going to think, ""Well, you know what?"	0
ClaimBuster	16663	I said that one day and Pat Moynihan, a Democrat, say, no, he said, in the history of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	16664	It's a great honor for me to be here standing here as the Republican nominee.	0
ClaimBuster	16665	Now, we have a big difference on this.	0
ClaimBuster	16666	I want to make sure that regulators see their job as encouraging small business, not crushing it.	0
ClaimBuster	16667	I traveled all over the world looking at the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, Joe Lieberman and I.	1
ClaimBuster	16668	And presidential leadership that I want to provide in this area will bring it down, but we've got to get the Democrats - Congress under control.	0
ClaimBuster	16669	I will -- I pledge to you I will do whatever is necessary to make sure that it stays that way.	0
ClaimBuster	16670	I believe in local control of governments, and obviously if they don't there needs to be a consequence at the federal level.	0
ClaimBuster	16671	But it seems to me the kids ought to -- if they've started, they ought to stop and just don't do it.	0
ClaimBuster	16672	He has never been involved in this campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	16673	What counts is, that the United States celebrated its 200th birthday on July fourth.	1
ClaimBuster	16674	Now, have to be other factors involved for me to want to be involved.	0
ClaimBuster	16675	You'll have hospital and providers that'll no longer accept Medicare patients.	0
ClaimBuster	16676	I thought that was a good model.	0
ClaimBuster	16677	You cannot lead an alliance if you say, you know, you're going alone.	0
ClaimBuster	16678	Our military is the strongest military in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	16679	And you know, Hillary, what you should have done, you should have changed the law when you were a United States senator...	0
ClaimBuster	16680	A few uh - months ago, or I should say, maybe two years ago, the Soviet Union looked like they had continued strength in the Middle East.	1
ClaimBuster	16681	And John tells us that first, we've got to reduce spending before we can reduce taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	16682	It called for an increase in the production of energy in the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	16683	I don't suggest that, I don't support it.	0
ClaimBuster	16684	That's what my campaign is all about and that's what it'll continue to be all about.	0
ClaimBuster	16685	I made a mistake because I couldn't have foreseen these circumstances and this is the best deal we can work out at the time.	0
ClaimBuster	16686	And so -- on the logging issue.	0
ClaimBuster	16687	And so my question is...	0
ClaimBuster	16688	And they know that I'll take care of them.	0
ClaimBuster	16689	I would not use American ground forces in Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	16690	But I have spent my whole life serving this country.	1
ClaimBuster	16691	But I hope we can talk about what we're going to do in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	16692	I think it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm going to do.	1
ClaimBuster	16693	But he's going to get a half-a-trillion dollars more over the next five years that he can use for additional programs, or hopefully, someplace down the line, balancing the budget.	0
ClaimBuster	16694	We've cut our oil imports to the lowest level in two decades because we've developed oil and natural gas.	1
ClaimBuster	16695	It's not my term, it's the president's own Secretary of Defense, called them devastating.	1
ClaimBuster	16696	I am not gonna raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs.	0
ClaimBuster	16697	Nowadays - 75 percent were for Israel before.	1
ClaimBuster	16698	You know people who've lost their jobs and lost their homes?	0
ClaimBuster	16699	We sent up a good bill on clean water, a sound bill on clean water.	0
ClaimBuster	16700	All I said, that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing.	0
ClaimBuster	16701	And we never picked him up on that and did what was necessary to transfer authority and to transfer reconstruction.	1
ClaimBuster	16702	I think that we should move step-by-step toward universal health coverage, but I am not in favor of government doing it all.	0
ClaimBuster	16703	But I want to get out there and give a better education opportunity to all of our children and that's why I vetoed the budget you passed with $30 billion in education cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	16704	I said something the other day where I was accused of being like Joe McCarthy because I questioned -- I put it this way; I think it's wrong to demonstrate against your own country or organize demonstrations against your own country in foreign soil.	0
ClaimBuster	16705	Now, what I've said is we should end this war responsibly.	0
ClaimBuster	16706	Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that's going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have.	0
ClaimBuster	16707	I think most Americans would say that doesn't make sense.	0
ClaimBuster	16708	And when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are doing well, and you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now, I think that is a continuation of the last eight years, and we can't afford another four.	1
ClaimBuster	16709	But number five, the other thing that we have to do is recognize that we can't continue to do nation building in these regions.	0
ClaimBuster	16710	And now there's 30 nations involved, standing side by side with our American troops.	1
ClaimBuster	16711	And I think it's time you take a stand...	0
ClaimBuster	16712	K-2 diagnostic testing so we know whether or not there's a deficiency.	0
ClaimBuster	16713	Indeed, we had to borrow $17 billion to pay the checks.	1
ClaimBuster	16714	Well, let me say, first of all, in February Senator Dole acknowledged that the American economy was in the best shape it's been in in 30 years.	1
ClaimBuster	16715	I was talking about Mr. Ford.	1
ClaimBuster	16716	That's $1 -- that's $1 for every $15 you've cut.	1
ClaimBuster	16717	I said we would change the way welfare works, and even before the bill passed we'd moved nearly two million people from welfare to work, working with states and communities.	1
ClaimBuster	16718	Seniors now understand that the promise made will be a promise kept, but younger workers now understand we better have a government that trusts them and that's exactly what I'm going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	16719	And you really have to pay attention to words.	0
ClaimBuster	16720	They determined it was medically safe for the women who use that drug.	1
ClaimBuster	16721	This is a - a gross waste of money, so tough, competent management of government, giving us a simple efficient purposeful and manageable government would be a great step forward and if I'm elected - and I intend to be - then it's gonna be done.	0
ClaimBuster	16722	We have to see the facts before we can draw conclusions.	0
ClaimBuster	16723	We can't shortchange those things.	0
ClaimBuster	16724	I am very concerned about it.	0
ClaimBuster	16725	Well, there are various elements of defense.	0
ClaimBuster	16726	What is more moral in foreign policy than for the administration to take the lead in the World Food Conference in Rome in 1974 when the United States committed six million metric tons of food - over 60 percent of the food committed for the disadvantaged and underdeveloped nations of the world?	1
ClaimBuster	16727	Not on their defending some minority opinion on the right or the left.	0
ClaimBuster	16728	What we've done is organize the international community, saying Assad has to go.	1
ClaimBuster	16729	I believe strongly that the federal government can help, we need to fund Headstart.	0
ClaimBuster	16730	The Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund.	1
ClaimBuster	16731	"My opponent at one time said, ""Well, get me elected, I'll have them out of there in six months."""	1
ClaimBuster	16732	And, you know, the Bush administration has come to recognize that it hasn't worked, this notion that we are simply silent when it comes to our enemies.	0
ClaimBuster	16733	And, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald.	1
ClaimBuster	16734	But I'm not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people.	0
ClaimBuster	16735	Coming from the political process.	0
ClaimBuster	16736	I think the Head Start program is a great program.	0
ClaimBuster	16737	I went to a school in Dade County, Florida where the facilities are so overcrowded the children have to eat lunch in shifts with the first shift for lunch starting at 9:30 in the morning.	1
ClaimBuster	16738	Well another thing we can do.	0
ClaimBuster	16739	Their aspirations are similar to young people's here.	0
ClaimBuster	16740	unemployment, the cities are all very important issues, but they pale into insignificance in the life and duties of a President when compared with the control of nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	16741	In my health care bill, I said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who is insured.	1
ClaimBuster	16742	In 1990, there was a vast coalition put together to run Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait.	1
ClaimBuster	16743	I hope we can economize elsewhere so that we don't have to.	0
ClaimBuster	16744	And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.	0
ClaimBuster	16745	And so I believe the answer is, I'm going to win it because I'm getting into focus my agenda for America's renewal, and also I think that Governor Clinton's had pretty much of a free ride.	0
ClaimBuster	16746	And the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state.	0
ClaimBuster	16747	You know several states now are letting people vote over three weeks.	1
ClaimBuster	16748	And that's what we've done over the last four years.	1
ClaimBuster	16749	Michael Dukakis has run for sheriff, and so has George Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	16750	For example, after my first trip abroad - abroad, I strongly recommended that we increase our exchange programs particularly as they related to exchange of persons of leaders in the labor field and in the information field.	1
ClaimBuster	16751	Is the guy out of work better off?	0
ClaimBuster	16752	Over the last 30 months, we've seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created.	1
ClaimBuster	16753	We come together both Republicans and Democrats.	0
ClaimBuster	16754	Secondly, Senator Dole, you voted against the crime bill that had the death penalty for drug kingpins in it.	1
ClaimBuster	16755	These are the kinds of elements of a national health insurance, important to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	16756	But the fact is that it has taken many turns which I think are unacceptable.	0
ClaimBuster	16757	And we've got a 35 percent unemployment rate in many areas of this country among construction workers.	1
ClaimBuster	16758	And there is an example.	0
ClaimBuster	16759	And I say that not as the Democratic standard-bearer, but as a citizen of the United States who is concerned about the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	16760	Well, one of the things that I tried to do was to make sure that everybody in the country who was under a managed care plan should at least have three choices of plans, and would have the right to get out without penalty every year.	1
ClaimBuster	16761	Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	16762	It encourages them to begin a war.	0
ClaimBuster	16763	My point is this: that once you do this - follow this course of action - of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return.	0
ClaimBuster	16764	But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.	1
ClaimBuster	16765	In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance.	0
ClaimBuster	16766	I know why jobs come and why they go.	0
ClaimBuster	16767	You haven't heard me mention this before, but we're getting close now and I think it's about time I start putting things in perspective.	0
ClaimBuster	16768	And most important, let's make education our highest priority so that every eight-year-old will be able to read, every 12-year-old can log onto the Internet, every 18-year-old can go to college.	0
ClaimBuster	16769	We have gone from the biggest deficits to the biggest surpluses.	1
ClaimBuster	16770	We both want to help the old people.	0
ClaimBuster	16771	But I will point out that I was called naive when I suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	16772	We're consuming 50 percent of the world's cocaine.	1
ClaimBuster	16773	There's no doubt itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gonna affect our budgets.	0
ClaimBuster	16774	"He said, ""It's not what he doesn't know that bothers me; it's what he knows for sure that just ain't so.''"	0
ClaimBuster	16775	I don't know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in America.	0
ClaimBuster	16776	But when a man who hopes to be President says, take this treaty, discard it, do not vote, do not debate, do not explore the issues, do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation - that is a very dangerous and disturbing thing.	0
ClaimBuster	16777	And therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	16778	A profound scientist recently made a different --	0
ClaimBuster	16779	First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico.	1
ClaimBuster	16780	I don't think he should say that our prestige is at an all-time low.	0
ClaimBuster	16781	He's a brave, brave man.	0
ClaimBuster	16782	We're raising money for the Republican Party, and we're doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so.	1
ClaimBuster	16783	I was in uh - thirty primaries in the spring, and uh - at first it was obvious that I didn't have any standing in the poll.	1
ClaimBuster	16784	I've got a pen, and I'm going to veto every single spending bill that comes across my desk.	0
ClaimBuster	16785	It's not a matter of diplomacy or trade with me.	0
ClaimBuster	16786	She doesn't have the stamina.	0
ClaimBuster	16787	The rest either abstained or voted against us.	1
ClaimBuster	16788	But I support the death penalty in the most heinous cases.	0
ClaimBuster	16789	So what, what is in my plan and I think it's almost identical in Senator Dole's plans is we make more people eligible to save in an IRA and let couples, married couples save more and then they could withdraw from it tax-free if they needed to, for medical emergencies or buy a home or education, but they could also save to supplement retirement.	0
ClaimBuster	16790	I've been a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; I run for the presidency with full knowledge that his great responsibility, really, given to him by the Constitution and by the force of events, is in the field of foreign affairs.	1
ClaimBuster	16791	If we take your advice with respect to how we change our tax codes so that companies that earn profits overseas don't pay U.S. taxes compared to companies here that are paying taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	16792	But -- but it'll -- it'll -- it'll be...	0
ClaimBuster	16793	What I will do is permit people to buy into Medicaid.	0
ClaimBuster	16794	We didn't guard the nuclear facilities.	1
ClaimBuster	16795	I'm very pleased that the Fraternal Order of Police in Little Rock, Arkansas endorsed me because I think they see I'm trying to strengthen the anti-crime legislation.	1
ClaimBuster	16796	I agree with what he's talking about in trying to get this spending down and the discipline, although I think we ought to totally exempt Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	16797	And I think this is a record that uh - the American people understand and will appreciate.	0
ClaimBuster	16798	We've become very, very sloppy.	0
ClaimBuster	16799	Uh - we had last year a $65 billion deficit - the largest deficit in the history of our country - more of a deficit spending than we had in the entire eight-year period under President Johnson and President Kennedy.	1
ClaimBuster	16800	In 1974, we had a so-called oil shock, wherein the price of OPEC oil was raised to an extraordinary degree.	1
ClaimBuster	16801	I thought that was wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	16802	Mr. Perot says it's a bad deal.	1
ClaimBuster	16803	But are the American people?	0
ClaimBuster	16804	And the main point is, taxes have been cut, and yet income is up to the Federal Government by 25 percent in the last three years.	1
ClaimBuster	16805	He didn't honor the agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	16806	We will strengthen our intelligence-gathering services.	0
ClaimBuster	16807	The people of the United States individually could not have developed the Tennessee Valley; collectively they could have.	0
ClaimBuster	16808	Now, let me just share something.	0
ClaimBuster	16809	And he said our troops would be occupiers in a bitterly hostile land.	1
ClaimBuster	16810	And therefore, I think, we should make it very clear the disagreement between Mr. Nixon and myself.	0
ClaimBuster	16811	Under Governor Bush, Texas has sunk to be 50th out of 50 in health care -- in health insurance for their citizens.	1
ClaimBuster	16812	I'm not going to worry about it anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	16813	But we ought to stand staunch.	0
ClaimBuster	16814	And so it was a man down there in that area that this was delivered to, and he recognized that what was in that manual was in direct contravention of my own Executive order, in December of 1981, that we would have nothing to do with regard to political assassinations.	1
ClaimBuster	16815	It's possible to detect those kind of tests.	1
ClaimBuster	16816	I want to thank you for listening tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	16817	I will not cut our military budget.	0
ClaimBuster	16818	It requires testing of all new teachers, including in the subjects that they teach.	0
ClaimBuster	16819	And so we decimated Al Qaida's core leadership in the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan.	1
ClaimBuster	16820	Governor Clinton said, well, I might have been with the minority, let sanctions work -- but I guess I would have voted with the majority.	1
ClaimBuster	16821	Now, that I think has to be our policy, because they are threatening to kill more Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	16822	And you say Exxon and Mobil.	0
ClaimBuster	16823	But let me just first, Cheryl, if you will, I want to thank Charlie for moderating.	0
ClaimBuster	16824	And I say that because I know a lot of people that feel like we should just brush our hands and walk away.	0
ClaimBuster	16825	Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.	0
ClaimBuster	16826	Those of us who are proudly pro-life understand that.	0
ClaimBuster	16827	I would not ship that Arab country anything - no weapons, no spare parts for weapons, no oil-drilling rigs, no oil pipe, no nothing.	0
ClaimBuster	16828	It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	16829	"You cannot lead the war on terror if you keep changing positions on the war on terror and say things like, ""Well, this is just a grand diversion."""	0
ClaimBuster	16830	Over the next four years, we'll continue to rally the armies of compassion, to help heal the hurt that exists in some of our country's neighborhoods.	0
ClaimBuster	16831	Now there are other places where the executive can lead, but let me just sum up by saying this: why do I talk every time I'm in the South on civil rights?	0
ClaimBuster	16832	And despite the politics of it, I stand where I stand, and I think I'm right, and before this fight is over we're going to come up with a better bill, a more effective bill that does not undermine the liberties of our people.	0
ClaimBuster	16833	And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot.	1
ClaimBuster	16834	I'll just mention one -- the Beasley Academic Center in Chicago.	0
ClaimBuster	16835	My friend, I'd like you to see the letter that a group of senators and I wrote warning exactly of this crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	16836	America and Americans decide not just what's happening in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	16837	That's why I want to down the tax rates on small employers, big employers, so they want to be here.	0
ClaimBuster	16838	Now we have two major carrier task forces.	1
ClaimBuster	16839	"The word of the president of the United States is good enough for me."""	0
ClaimBuster	16840	But four years ago, I told the American people and I told you I would cut taxes for middle class families.	1
ClaimBuster	16841	That sense is something that I want to restore.	0
ClaimBuster	16842	But I'm feeling a little better tonight, and I'll tell you why.	0
ClaimBuster	16843	But I would go against them if she releases her e-mails.	0
ClaimBuster	16844	And that's exactly what it's done.	1
ClaimBuster	16845	But keep in mind this bill covers 5 percent of the employers, and 95 percent of the employers and all those employees they employ are not covered in this act.	1
ClaimBuster	16846	What I will do as president is make sure it's more attractive to come to America again.	0
ClaimBuster	16847	I mean, I'm -- I'm pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the Iranians to end their nuclear program.	0
ClaimBuster	16848	Look, over the last eight years, this administration, along with Senator McCain, have been solely focused on Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	16849	I flew a combat mission, my last one was over Manila.	1
ClaimBuster	16850	And I would hope that we would give to women in this country the right to make that decision, and to make it in the exercise of their conscience and religious beliefs.	0
ClaimBuster	16851	We find that the Soviet Union is a very primitive economy.	0
ClaimBuster	16852	So I really don't think so.	0
ClaimBuster	16853	The goal of the sanctions was not to remove Saddam Hussein, it was to remove the weapons of mass destruction.	1
ClaimBuster	16854	I mean, what kind of judgment-I mean, jumping all over the president on his decision on one area of farm policy.	0
ClaimBuster	16855	This election is not about debating tricks, it is about your future.	0
ClaimBuster	16856	But isn't the real question that we have to answer not how many exceptions we make, because the vice president himself is prepared to make exceptions.	0
ClaimBuster	16857	I don't think that uh - America can go on a big spending spree with a whole lot of new programs uh - that would add significantly to the federal budget.	0
ClaimBuster	16858	We don't know whether he's developing weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	16859	With her, it's all talk and no action.	0
ClaimBuster	16860	Now as far as the No Child Left Behind is concerned, it was a great first beginning in my view.	0
ClaimBuster	16861	Reduce the White House staff by a 3rd after or at the same time the Congress does the same thing for their staff.	0
ClaimBuster	16862	Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position.	1
ClaimBuster	16863	Maybe there is no hacking.	0
ClaimBuster	16864	It's not trickle down economics.	0
ClaimBuster	16865	As soon as she releases them, I will release.	0
ClaimBuster	16866	The mistake that both parties made in Washington with the S&L business was deregulating them without proper capital requirements, proper oversight and regulation, proper training of the executives.	1
ClaimBuster	16867	I've spent my life creating jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	16868	We need to call upon Syria to release the three Israeli soldiers who have been captured.	0
ClaimBuster	16869	There is a woman named Winifred Skinner here tonight from Iowa.	1
ClaimBuster	16870	I'm going to change that.	0
ClaimBuster	16871	This lady said here, how have you been affected by the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	16872	This means at the secretary of state level and at the ambassadorial level.	0
ClaimBuster	16873	My -- my passion probably flows from the fact that I believe in God.	0
ClaimBuster	16874	I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about -- how long is it, Hillary, three months?	0
ClaimBuster	16875	We have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was.	1
ClaimBuster	16876	We have recommended that in the h- housing program we can reduce down payments and moderate monthly payments.	1
ClaimBuster	16877	These are unidentified people, and after the bomb goes off, they're blown to bits because they are suicidal individuals who think they're going to go to paradise if they perpetrate such an act and lose their life in doing it.	0
ClaimBuster	16878	The facts are you now have a government that comes at you.	0
ClaimBuster	16879	And the facts are facts and records are records.	0
ClaimBuster	16880	We preach in the Declaration of Independence and in the Constitution, in the statement of our greatest leaders, we preach very high standards; and if we're not going to be s- charged before the world with hypocrisy we have to meet those standards.	0
ClaimBuster	16881	We're going to say you have a five-year limit.	0
ClaimBuster	16882	It says let's give parents the choice of a public, private or public school -- public, private or religious school.	1
ClaimBuster	16883	And over the last summers I've flown over there.	1
ClaimBuster	16884	And that's the perspective I bring when I think about what's called entitlements.	0
ClaimBuster	16885	My opponent opposed the missile defenses.	1
ClaimBuster	16886	It would not be appropriate for me to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	16887	And one of the things that the Vice President either ignores or won't address is the fact that you can't divorce our military security from our economic security.	0
ClaimBuster	16888	That's why we've invested in solar and wind and biofuels, energy efficient cars.	1
ClaimBuster	16889	He was wrong about Russia when they committed aggression against Georgia.	0
ClaimBuster	16890	That's the reason why we have brought more cases against China for violating trade rules than the other -- the previous administration had done in two terms.	1
ClaimBuster	16891	those imports have been reduced.	1
ClaimBuster	16892	I think free trade is going to expand our job opportunity.	0
ClaimBuster	16893	But after 9/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it.	1
ClaimBuster	16894	We're going to have to prioritize, just like a family has to prioritize.	0
ClaimBuster	16895	We've had several fragmentary efforts by members of the Congress and by - by private citizens.	1
ClaimBuster	16896	And they recognize we got great difficulties, but they're also much more optimistic than the pessimists we have up here tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	16897	We're going to bring the $2.5 trillion...	0
ClaimBuster	16898	Yes, we got problems at home.	1
ClaimBuster	16899	And the reason I'm worried is because there's a vicious enemy that has an ideology of hate.	0
ClaimBuster	16900	And uh - that would be another factor that I would follow.	0
ClaimBuster	16901	And we're going to get the great entrepreneurial spirit of this country, and we're going to free ourselves from this dependency on Mideast oil.	0
ClaimBuster	16902	Many of you viewers don't know, but Laura and I sent our girls to public school.	1
ClaimBuster	16903	And I think that's a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	16904	I have met with the heads of government bilaterally as well as multilaterally.	1
ClaimBuster	16905	Under my plan, half of their costs would be paid right away.	0
ClaimBuster	16906	Today there are only three left including the one in Cuba.	1
ClaimBuster	16907	Most of the tax cuts went to low- and middle-income Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	16908	The president said he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through that full process.	1
ClaimBuster	16909	... go to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it.	1
ClaimBuster	16910	These problems are not easy.	0
ClaimBuster	16911	You are the ones who are making car payments and mortgage payments and doing right by your kids.	0
ClaimBuster	16912	How did we get on to Putin?	0
ClaimBuster	16913	I have to take ten seconds here at the end -- the red light isn't on yet -- to say to Ross Perot, please don't say to the DEA agents on the street that we don't have the will to fight drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	16914	They have too many employees.	0
ClaimBuster	16915	It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?	0
ClaimBuster	16916	Who has been the person who has tried to keep spending under control?	0
ClaimBuster	16917	That's the kind of exaggeration I was just talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	16918	We need to accelerate the drug approval process.	0
ClaimBuster	16919	And I give credit -- I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked.	0
ClaimBuster	16920	That's the difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	16921	I'm opposed to these policies as well.	0
ClaimBuster	16922	Actually, it's not an empty promise.	0
ClaimBuster	16923	Third, I think it's possible to gain a seven hundred million to a billion dollars through tax changes which I believe would close up loof- loopholes on dividend withholding, on expense accounts.	0
ClaimBuster	16924	Well, he doesn't like trickle down government but I think he's talking about the Reagan-Bush years where we created 15 million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	16925	First of all, Mr. Mondale should know that the President of the United States did not order the marines into that barracks.	1
ClaimBuster	16926	So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term?	0
ClaimBuster	16927	I was called the sheriff, by the -- one of the senior members of the Appropriations Committee.	1
ClaimBuster	16928	-- I couldn't agree with you more, couldn't agree with you more.	0
ClaimBuster	16929	And then you wouldn't have had them.	0
ClaimBuster	16930	I suggest you might consider somebody who's created jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	16931	The point I want to make to you is, a bipartisan commission reviewed my plan and the Bush plan and there were as many Republicans as Democratic health care experts on it.	1
ClaimBuster	16932	Is -- are Israel and the Palestinians closer to reaching a peace agreement?	0
ClaimBuster	16933	And most importantly, we give small business a 50 percent tax credit so that after we lower the costs of health care, they also get, whether they're self-employed or a small business, a lower cost to be able to cover their employees.	1
ClaimBuster	16934	But even before then the problem hits because the money contributed to Social Security this year is an entitlement.	0
ClaimBuster	16935	But I do point out that he's been wrong on many foreign policy and national security issues, which is supposed to be his strength.	0
ClaimBuster	16936	"Next thing I know, one of these ACT UP groups is out saying, ""Bush ought to change his behavior."""	0
ClaimBuster	16937	I said I did if administered fairly and justly.	0
ClaimBuster	16938	We did it without any of our allies that helped in the Gulf.	1
ClaimBuster	16939	If one vote per precinct had changed in 1960, John Kennedy would never have been President of this nation.	1
ClaimBuster	16940	Not only would it threaten Israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	16941	I haven't made a promise about...	0
ClaimBuster	16942	But I believe that all of us together, and I believe the Presidency is what Teddy Roosevelt said it was.	0
ClaimBuster	16943	We cannot turn the job over to anyone else.	0
ClaimBuster	16944	Well, I must say that the reason that the schools have been constructed is because the local school districts were willing to increase the property taxes to a tremendously high figure - in my opinion, almost to the point of diminishing returns in order to sustain these schools.	1
ClaimBuster	16945	And I just want to make my position absolutely clear with regard to getting intelligence information.	0
ClaimBuster	16946	First, with regard to Poland, when I talked to Mr. Gomulka, the present leader of Poland, for six hours in Warsaw last year, I learned something about their problems and particularly his.	1
ClaimBuster	16947	Are you afraid I couldn't hear him?	0
ClaimBuster	16948	And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.	0
ClaimBuster	16949	But we've got to do a lot better on education, and we have to do, be tougher on those who commit crimes.	0
ClaimBuster	16950	We have to keep Americans' taxes low.	0
ClaimBuster	16951	But in any event, I think we just look at the facts.	0
ClaimBuster	16952	Talk about the VA: We've increased VA funding by $22 billion in the four years since I've been president.	1
ClaimBuster	16953	We have seen the strongest economy in the history of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	16954	That's why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	16955	If the United States had not moved when we did in southern Africa, there's no doubt there would have been an acceleration of bloodshed in that tragic part of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	16956	Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.	0
ClaimBuster	16957	I really tried to be faithful to your request that we answer the questions specifically and pointedly.	0
ClaimBuster	16958	Of course it's OK to go across state lines because in Arizona they may offer a better plan that suits you best than it does here in Tennessee.	0
ClaimBuster	16959	But that was 10 years before you took office.	1
ClaimBuster	16960	...I would liquidate the industry.	0
ClaimBuster	16961	He cut if off, sort of arbitrarily.	1
ClaimBuster	16962	That has escalated now to sixteen and a half million dollars, in the last uh Republican administration.	1
ClaimBuster	16963	Now, it's hard to out-spend Congress but he tried to for the last 3 years.	1
ClaimBuster	16964	And, as a matter of fact, the previous administration stood by and so did I -- not that I could have done anything in my position at that time -- but for this revolution to take place.	1
ClaimBuster	16965	The first is, the difference is there is no new accountability measures in Vice President Gore's plan.	1
ClaimBuster	16966	I show how I pay for the health care, how we pay for the education.	0
ClaimBuster	16967	Last point about Senator McCain's plan is that insurers right now, the main restrictions on what they do is primarily state law and, under Senator McCain's plan, those rules would be stripped away and you would start seeing a lot more insurance companies cherry-picking and excluding people from coverage.	0
ClaimBuster	16968	Because we reduced the deficit four years in a row.	1
ClaimBuster	16969	And so everything we're doing, we're doing in consultation with our partners in the region, including Israel which obviously has a huge interest in seeing what happens in Syria; coordinating with Turkey and other countries in the region that have a great interest in this.	1
ClaimBuster	16970	I want to thank President Reagan for agreeing to debate.	0
ClaimBuster	16971	I would tighten those sanctions further.	0
ClaimBuster	16972	But they're matters that are ah - important.	0
ClaimBuster	16973	7.7 million elderly citizens who were living in the lowest 20 percent of earnings -- 7.7 million have moved up into another bracket since our administration took over, leaving only 5 million of the elderly in that bracket when there had been more than 13 million.	1
ClaimBuster	16974	But they see a compassionate, strong, great first lady in Laura Bush.	0
ClaimBuster	16975	But it's not OK with me, because based on what she's saying, and based on where she's going, and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day.	0
ClaimBuster	16976	That's what we've been going through for the last eight years.	0
ClaimBuster	16977	So, thank you for giving me a chance to straighten the record.	0
ClaimBuster	16978	The Clinton Foundation raised $30 million to help Haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had.	1
ClaimBuster	16979	So I think Mr. Perot was right in questioning the management practices.	1
ClaimBuster	16980	I voted for small-business tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	16981	It's understandable that a Senator in the preliminary debates can make an irresponsible statement, or, maybe, an ill-advised statement.	0
ClaimBuster	16982	We're the best fed; we're the best clothed, with a better distribution of this world's goods to all of our people than any people in history.	0
ClaimBuster	16983	I don't want the federal government making decisions on behalf of everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	16984	And I suspect he'll keep those too.	0
ClaimBuster	16985	I ran the Olympics and balanced the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	16986	I believe all senior citizens should be able to choose their own doctors and get prescription drugs from their own pharmacists with Medicare paying half the bill.	0
ClaimBuster	16987	This state became one of the top five in the nation for health care coverage for children under his leadership.	1
ClaimBuster	16988	We had a better idea.	0
ClaimBuster	16989	And I do advocate a pardon for - for draft evaders.	0
ClaimBuster	16990	You're talking about 2 different subjects.	1
ClaimBuster	16991	That's why I want to invest in you.	0
ClaimBuster	16992	Thank you, and that's an opportunity for me, and I appreciate it.	0
ClaimBuster	16993	Now, look, Americans are hurting tonight and they're angry and I understand that, and they want a new direction.	0
ClaimBuster	16994	That's why I'm asking for your vote and that's why I'm asking for another four years.	0
ClaimBuster	16995	If you cut the amount going in 1 out of every $6, then you have to cut the value of each check by 1 out of every $6 unless you come up with the money from somewhere else.	0
ClaimBuster	16996	The final point is that we can use this money that we save on these weapons to spend on things that we really need.	0
ClaimBuster	16997	If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.	0
ClaimBuster	16998	And then throughout the world appoint the best people we can get, ambassadors who can speak the language - no mere - not merely people who made a political contribution but who can speak the language.	0
ClaimBuster	16999	And that is: not just to keep freedom for ourselves but to extend it to all the world, to extend it to all the world because that is America's destiny.	0
ClaimBuster	17000	Well, Jim, I want to thank you, and I want to thank Governor Romney, because I think was a terrific debate, and I very much appreciate it.	0
ClaimBuster	17001	We can have serious differences about our health care policy, for example, John, because we do have a difference on health care policy, but we...	1
ClaimBuster	17002	I just don't like the way John Ashcroft has applied it, and we're going to change a few things.	0
ClaimBuster	17003	As far as Indochina was concerned, I stated over and over again that it was essential during that period that the United States make it clear that we would not tolerate Indochina falling under Communist domination.	1
ClaimBuster	17004	Look what's happening to McDonnell Douglas; even Boeing is losing market share -- because we let the Europeans spend $25-$40 billion on Airbus without an appropriate competitive response.	1
ClaimBuster	17005	Secondly, I don't have any litmus test.	0
ClaimBuster	17006	This has been a very successful effort.	0
ClaimBuster	17007	Let me just say one final example.	0
ClaimBuster	17008	Since the assassination of our best leaders in the '60's, since the Vietnam War, since Watergate, and because we need campaign finance reform.	0
ClaimBuster	17009	But I will tell you, I sat there...	0
ClaimBuster	17010	I thought it was a bad decision.	0
ClaimBuster	17011	So let's get the record straight.	0
ClaimBuster	17012	It means that Governor Romney...	0
ClaimBuster	17013	I said we'd refocus attention on those who actually attacked us on 9/11, and we have gone after Al Qaeda's leadership like never before and Osama bin Laden is dead.	0
ClaimBuster	17014	We have, to one-third of what it was.	1
ClaimBuster	17015	(Applause) But don't take it out of my time!	0
ClaimBuster	17016	Well, had we joined the Kyoto treaty, which I guess he's referring to, it would have cost America a lot of jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	17017	I want to leave money in your pocket.	0
ClaimBuster	17018	This is in our country, folks, the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	17019	We have millions of people that did it the right way.	1
ClaimBuster	17020	Those investments are what's going to help to make sure that we continue to lead this world economy, not just next year, but 10 years from now, 50 years from now, 100 years from now.	1
ClaimBuster	17021	The special Federal commission made good solid recommendations.	0
ClaimBuster	17022	I have a plan that's going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early.	0
ClaimBuster	17023	And I have been a secretary of state...	1
ClaimBuster	17024	Certainly education and training is crucial.	0
ClaimBuster	17025	I make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage.	0
ClaimBuster	17026	We want to know when we retaliate that we're retaliating with those who are responsible for the terrorist acts.	0
ClaimBuster	17027	So all of this is possible.	0
ClaimBuster	17028	And we've just got to make sure, before somebody thinks they're buying a product, that it works.	0
ClaimBuster	17029	And that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	17030	I served my country in Vietnam.	1
ClaimBuster	17031	Of course we're going to have to make some determination on this, and we're going to have to make it on the convention forces.	0
ClaimBuster	17032	The -- and I just fundamentally disagree.	0
ClaimBuster	17033	"This is the same thing we heard -- remember, I appeared on ""Meet the Press"" with Tim Russert in 1990-something."	1
ClaimBuster	17034	I am not going to make the decision as to what the tactics could be, but obviously there are a number of areas in the world that are of importance to us.	0
ClaimBuster	17035	It was the right decision.	0
ClaimBuster	17036	Number 4, we would fully fund the Head Start program to get little kids off to a good start.	0
ClaimBuster	17037	A brown field is an abandoned industrial site that just sits idle in some of our urban centers.	1
ClaimBuster	17038	So nobody is more concerned about their safety and security than I am.	0
ClaimBuster	17039	And I think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference.	0
ClaimBuster	17040	There are challenges around the world that are new and different and there will be different -- we will be talking about countries sometime in the future that we hardly know where they are on the map, some Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	17041	We've been through a lot together as a country -- been through a recession, corporate scandals, war.	0
ClaimBuster	17042	You talk about somebody strong.	1
ClaimBuster	17043	Because by his own budget numbers, his proposals for spending on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy are more than the new spending proposals that he has made for health care and education and national defense all combined.	1
ClaimBuster	17044	Co-payments go up, costs go up, skyrocketing costs, which make people less and less able to afford health insurance in America.	1
ClaimBuster	17045	I don't want to stampede.	0
ClaimBuster	17046	But, of course, there's no way we can know whether any of that is true, because he hasn't released his tax returns.	1
ClaimBuster	17047	I think only if you're doing this -- and he's done it more than I have in terms of the presidency -- can you begin to get a sense of what it means to your families.	0
ClaimBuster	17048	It's called the Buffett rule.	1
ClaimBuster	17049	The result was that the Guatemalan people themselves eventually rose up and they threw him out.	1
ClaimBuster	17050	Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.	1
ClaimBuster	17051	We use people that get the position because they gave -- they made a campaign contribution and they're dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are.	0
ClaimBuster	17052	Where are companies going to go where they can create jobs and where they can do best in business?	0
ClaimBuster	17053	But I made the decision because I thought it was in the right interests of our security.	0
ClaimBuster	17054	He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.	1
ClaimBuster	17055	I apologize to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	17056	Number two, we have to work with cities and others to help generate economic growth in those communities -- through the Urban Development Action Grant Program.	0
ClaimBuster	17057	It didn't meet my test.	0
ClaimBuster	17058	I'm sure that we all accept and admire his commitment to his faith, and we are strengthened, all of us, by that fact.	0
ClaimBuster	17059	Who can give themselves a 23% pay raise anywhere in the world except Congress?	0
ClaimBuster	17060	I did everything I could to get General Motors to face its problems in the mid-'80s while it was still financially strong.	1
ClaimBuster	17061	We have to be the strongest economic power in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	17062	And so I do believe that we have to consider it as part of our interests, our national interests, in intervening where possible.	0
ClaimBuster	17063	He is alive today because of the criminal justice system.	0
ClaimBuster	17064	I'm proud of the record of this Administration.	0
ClaimBuster	17065	Number three, we'd open the doors to college education to high school graduates without regard to income.	0
ClaimBuster	17066	They've only approved about 10% of the agenda I've helped to send up there.	1
ClaimBuster	17067	And the reason we could do that is because of our fantastic success in winning the Cold War.	0
ClaimBuster	17068	I am concerned about a tax on Muslims, for example, over there.	1
ClaimBuster	17069	Let me just take two seconds of my time because I'm the Commander-in-Chief to respond to one thing that was said.	1
ClaimBuster	17070	But we have work to do in this nation.	0
ClaimBuster	17071	It's also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims.	0
ClaimBuster	17072	Be a wonderful time for the Russians to step into the Balkans and convince Mr. Milosevic that it's in his best interest and his country's best interest to leave office.	0
ClaimBuster	17073	Jeremy, first of all, your future is bright.	0
ClaimBuster	17074	And you ask how -- how are we going to do that?	0
ClaimBuster	17075	And we uh - had the emperor of Japan here this uh - past year and the net result is Japan and the United States are working more closely together now than at any time in the history of our relationship.	1
ClaimBuster	17076	Governor Clinton clicked off the things -- he's going to take on insurance companies and bureaucracies.	0
ClaimBuster	17077	Since he's been in office, two and a half million more American people have lost their jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	17078	Dean Acheson, George Marshall were strong secretaries of uh - state - excuse me - state.	0
ClaimBuster	17079	I think the American people will make their own decisions on character and at a time when we have work to do and we need action I think they need to clearly understand the backgrounds of each person.	0
ClaimBuster	17080	They admit it's an issue.	1
ClaimBuster	17081	I'll have to get this out very fast.	0
ClaimBuster	17082	Now, they may blame other folks, but it's time to get somebody in Washington who is going to work with both Republicans and Democrats to get some positive things done when it comes to our seniors.	0
ClaimBuster	17083	Now, that is the issue.	0
ClaimBuster	17084	You got that fact wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	17085	Now, again, if I get up there, if you send me, we're going to have some blunt talks about this, and we're really going to get down in the trenches and say, is this one you want to talk about or fix, because talk won't do it, folks.	0
ClaimBuster	17086	Our analysis indicates that something in the magnitude of about one hundred fifty to two hundred thousand jobs would uh - be made available.	1
ClaimBuster	17087	Well, let me--I have to correct one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	17088	They get to choose -- and they'll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them.	0
ClaimBuster	17089	Germany and Japan spend around $30 billion a piece.	1
ClaimBuster	17090	I think we can do a better job.	0
ClaimBuster	17091	That's not the right course for us.	0
ClaimBuster	17092	Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued.	1
ClaimBuster	17093	And then, I mentioned it the other night, I think if there's a crisis, people are going to say, well, George Bush has taken us through some tough crises, and we trust him to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	17094	You'll still have choice of doctor.	1
ClaimBuster	17095	I believe we can do better.	0
ClaimBuster	17096	I don't believe that uh that Mr. Carter's been any more specific in this case than he has been on many other instances.	0
ClaimBuster	17097	Uh - We would hope to control the House, to get a majority in the House uh - in this election.	0
ClaimBuster	17098	We must make this next century the century of the individual.	0
ClaimBuster	17099	They must know, in other words, that it is national suicide if they begin anything.	0
ClaimBuster	17100	We've got to drill offshore, my friends, and we've got to do it now, and we can do it.	0
ClaimBuster	17101	You know, for a while he was a strong supporter of getting rid of Saddam Hussein.	1
ClaimBuster	17102	He's indicating that we should fight for these islands come what may because they are, in his words, in the area of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	17103	That's what I'd like them to know about me; that I've gotten up every day and worked for the American people and worked so that their children could have their dreams come true.	0
ClaimBuster	17104	I think we are today.	0
ClaimBuster	17105	"When they said, ""We're going to cut Planned Parenthood funding."""	1
ClaimBuster	17106	They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted.	0
ClaimBuster	17107	Let me take uh - South Korea as an example.	0
ClaimBuster	17108	That is not good for America's position in the world, and the world notices.	0
ClaimBuster	17109	But I am discussing the power the President has to grant pardons.	0
ClaimBuster	17110	I really don't need uh - Mr. Nixon to tell me about what my responsibilities are as a citizen.	0
ClaimBuster	17111	I have appointed one member to the Supreme Court: Sandra Day O'Connor.	1
ClaimBuster	17112	The truth is what good policy is based on.	0
ClaimBuster	17113	I also believe that it is -- one of the reasons we can't do it is we're overextended.	0
ClaimBuster	17114	That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work.	1
ClaimBuster	17115	Why do they have to say we're going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they're saying?	0
ClaimBuster	17116	I am not quoting myself.	0
ClaimBuster	17117	Two women, both of them probably in their mid- to late-50s, had just been laid off of their plant.	1
ClaimBuster	17118	I don't think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear.	0
ClaimBuster	17119	I will pay down the debt every year.	0
ClaimBuster	17120	But that's the good news.	0
ClaimBuster	17121	But understand, that was a tactic designed to contain the damage of the previous four years of mismanagement of this war.	0
ClaimBuster	17122	We are growing -- our last report came out -- and it's right around the 1 percent level.	1
ClaimBuster	17123	But this is an important issue.	0
ClaimBuster	17124	Median income is down $4,300 a family and 23 million Americans out of work.	1
ClaimBuster	17125	And what I would like to do is see the National Guard and Reserve be deployed differently here in our own country.	0
ClaimBuster	17126	It's not by trickle-down government, saying we're going to take more money from people and hire more government workers, raise more taxes, put in place more regulations.	0
ClaimBuster	17127	That's the kind of mindset that says sanctions were working.	0
ClaimBuster	17128	In my state, we're leading the country in private sector job growth.	1
ClaimBuster	17129	Mr. Nixon would add a guarantee to islands five miles off the coast of the re- Republic of China when he's never really protested the Communists seizing Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	17130	We want them to continue that.	0
ClaimBuster	17131	Now, everybody will faint in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	17132	And there, again, he sort of slid by the question.	0
ClaimBuster	17133	Do you want to fix the problem or sound-bite it?	0
ClaimBuster	17134	The other was could an administration change the tone in Washington, D.C. And I believe the answer is yes, otherwise I wouldn't be asking for your vote.	0
ClaimBuster	17135	It's time for a new look.	0
ClaimBuster	17136	And I don't know if I've been born again, but I know I was born into a Christian family.	1
ClaimBuster	17137	So, it's not a question of saying our budget is full of a lot of waste.	0
ClaimBuster	17138	I question - and I don't question his concern about the war in Vietnam.	0
ClaimBuster	17139	"Medicare -- the issue of Medicare used to be called ""Mediscare."""	1
ClaimBuster	17140	So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.	1
ClaimBuster	17141	This means that the average family income went up fifteen per cent in the Eisenhower years as against two per cent in the Truman years.	1
ClaimBuster	17142	More in August than July.	1
ClaimBuster	17143	But, what you can't do is spend $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military is not asking for, $5 trillion on tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	17144	So watch Ukraine, and let's make sure that we -- that the Ukrainians understand that we are their friend and ally.	0
ClaimBuster	17145	I want every family to have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care.	0
ClaimBuster	17146	I believe he will go.	0
ClaimBuster	17147	You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.	1
ClaimBuster	17148	Under my plan I will put Medicare in an iron clad lockbox and prevent the money from being used for anything other than Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	17149	If - Iran is not an Arab country, as you know, it is a Moslem country - but if Saudi Arabia should declare an oil embargo against us, then I would consider that an economic declaration of war.	1
ClaimBuster	17150	I'm a product of a public school.	1
ClaimBuster	17151	Thirdly, I believe that India represents a great area for affirmative action by the free world.	0
ClaimBuster	17152	And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	17153	We've made progress in Northern Ireland, in the Middle East.	1
ClaimBuster	17154	And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see.	0
ClaimBuster	17155	That's what my mission will be in the presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	17156	And they have managed, in spite of all of our attempts at arms limitation, to go forward with the biggest military build-up in the history of man.	1
ClaimBuster	17157	They're hurting, and they're angry.	0
ClaimBuster	17158	There's no way you can pay for that five year, $40 billion tax cut for the rich and still buy all those weapons systems you want to buy unless you raid the Social Security Trust Fund.	0
ClaimBuster	17159	I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers.	1
ClaimBuster	17160	So as we phase these industries over, there's a whole of intellectual talent in these industries.	0
ClaimBuster	17161	And finally, he says we ought to have a summit.	0
ClaimBuster	17162	You know, so one of your liberal friends.	0
ClaimBuster	17163	And the Taliban are no longer in power.	1
ClaimBuster	17164	Well, first let me say with respect to the freeze, that back in the spring of 1982 Mr. Bush was a lot more sympathetic to the freeze than he seems to be today.	0
ClaimBuster	17165	Social Security and Medicare are entirely different in terms of the financial stabilities.	1
ClaimBuster	17166	This permits them to maintain their self-respect.	0
ClaimBuster	17167	And you know, according to my mother and my wife and my daughter, this world would be a lot better place if women were running it most of the time.	0
ClaimBuster	17168	It's going up at numbers that nobody's ever seen worldwide.	1
ClaimBuster	17169	I think it's worthy for a follow-up.	0
ClaimBuster	17170	And we can do it in an environmentally sound way.	0
ClaimBuster	17171	The Earned Income Tax Credit, sorry.	0
ClaimBuster	17172	That's why on day one, i will label them a currency manipulator, which allows us to apply tariffs where they're taking jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	17173	Because we have so mismanaged our country over the years, and it is now time to pay the fiddler.	0
ClaimBuster	17174	As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree.	0
ClaimBuster	17175	We have a four trillion dollar debt, and only in America would you finance seventy percent of it five years or less.	1
ClaimBuster	17176	I'm going to cut regulations.	0
ClaimBuster	17177	People need to remember: Six months prior to my arrival, the stock market started to go down.	1
ClaimBuster	17178	"The Clear Skies bill that he just talked about, it's one of those Orwellian names you pull out of the sky, slap it onto something, like ""No Child Left Behind"" but you leave millions of children behind."	0
ClaimBuster	17179	Yes, I'd be glad to.	0
ClaimBuster	17180	You're going to be paying for it.	0
ClaimBuster	17181	It is one that will continue to be a problem for years to come.	0
ClaimBuster	17182	Because the economy was on the verge of collapse, because we were about to go through the worst recession since the Great Depression, as a consequence of some of the same policies that Governor Romney's now promoting.	1
ClaimBuster	17183	Those things would help a great deal with the cities, but we still have a - a very serious problem there.	0
ClaimBuster	17184	It was rather a vague statement that they finally made.	0
ClaimBuster	17185	Governors like me and others have been trying to deal with the consequences.	0
ClaimBuster	17186	Right from the bottom up, the American people have got to say they want it.	0
ClaimBuster	17187	Mr Bush sent two people in secret to toast the Chinese leaders and basically tell them not to worry about it.	1
ClaimBuster	17188	One works for the family, and one works to pay taxes for the government.	0
ClaimBuster	17189	And with respect to this pipeline that Governor Romney keeps on talking about, we've -- we've built enough pipeline to wrap around the entire earth once.	1
ClaimBuster	17190	I mean, these aren't make-up figures.	1
ClaimBuster	17191	I think that grows the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	17192	That answer was about as clear as Boston harbor.	0
ClaimBuster	17193	Let's give them a real choice, the kind of choice you had, and the kind of choice a lot of people have in America.	0
ClaimBuster	17194	And so what I've said is that there's been some missed opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	17195	Are we as strong as we should be?	0
ClaimBuster	17196	And it's paid for, and I'll tell you how I'll pay for it.	0
ClaimBuster	17197	Anytime you think you want to legalize drugs, go to a neonatal unit -- if you can get in.	0
ClaimBuster	17198	That's what I've been critical about the administration for.	0
ClaimBuster	17199	But this is locker room talk.	0
ClaimBuster	17200	Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	17201	That's why I said to Afghanistan: If you harbor a terrorist, you're just as guilty as the terrorist.	1
ClaimBuster	17202	I believe that the free enterprise system is the greatest engine of prosperity the world's ever known.	0
ClaimBuster	17203	And so I simply do not think we should go back to the isolation days and starting blaming foreigners.	0
ClaimBuster	17204	People around the world with accredited degrees in science and math get a green card stapled to their diploma, come to the U.S. of A.	1
ClaimBuster	17205	We can have filters on Internets where public money is spent.	0
ClaimBuster	17206	In view of the difficulties we've had with the islands, in view of the difficulties and disputes we've had with Chiang Kai-shek, that's the only position we can take.	0
ClaimBuster	17207	Number one, we do need to expand domestic production and that means, for example, telling the oil companies the 68 million acres that they currently have leased that they're not drilling, use them or lose them.	1
ClaimBuster	17208	But they have to pay up.	0
ClaimBuster	17209	On our last television debate, I pointed out that it was my position that Americans must choose the best man that either party could produce.	1
ClaimBuster	17210	Well, but there is no -- but there is no evidence -- but there is...	0
ClaimBuster	17211	And it's important that we do have a good relation, because that enables me to better comment to him, and to better to discuss with him, some of the decisions he makes.	0
ClaimBuster	17212	And they're interested in what you're interested in.	0
ClaimBuster	17213	And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress.	0
ClaimBuster	17214	I believe we can meet the problems within the cities of this country and still uh - give a tax reduction.	0
ClaimBuster	17215	Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester.	0
ClaimBuster	17216	But unfortunately, in -- nowhere in the world is America's influence greater today than it was four years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	17217	I'm just as sick as you are by having to wake up and figure out how to defend myself every day.	0
ClaimBuster	17218	And that means we can't provide health care to people who need it.	0
ClaimBuster	17219	Now let me correct one other comment that uh - Governor Carter has made.	0
ClaimBuster	17220	But they always blame Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	17221	"Not a message a commander in chief gives, or this is a ""great diversion."""	0
ClaimBuster	17222	He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.	1
ClaimBuster	17223	You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them.	0
ClaimBuster	17224	We all fight over how much money is there.	0
ClaimBuster	17225	The issue of our natural resources; the right of posterity to inherit the earth, and what kind of earth will it be?	0
ClaimBuster	17226	In May of this year, Governor Carter took the first initiative, approximately twelve months after I had taken my initiative a year ago.	1
ClaimBuster	17227	I believe that we can work together.	0
ClaimBuster	17228	I have always opposed drawing a line.	1
ClaimBuster	17229	I haven't sorted out the penalties.	0
ClaimBuster	17230	And the only difference between me and any other businessman that has the range of businesses that I have is I haven't had that many lawsuits.	1
ClaimBuster	17231	But more importantly, we've reformed the system to make sure that we solve problems early, before they're too late.	0
ClaimBuster	17232	I'd get rid of it.	0
ClaimBuster	17233	We share a common border with another nation.	1
ClaimBuster	17234	There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.	0
ClaimBuster	17235	That's how it's going to be paid for, but we don't know the details.	0
ClaimBuster	17236	They can be carried out underground, they c- could be carried on in outer space.	1
ClaimBuster	17237	And so I have great confidence in him.	0
ClaimBuster	17238	America is at peace and with freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	17239	The US came together as we haven't in many, many years.	0
ClaimBuster	17240	At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president.	1
ClaimBuster	17241	I don't know what affirmative access means.	0
ClaimBuster	17242	But I would make the effort because I think the fate not only of our own civilization, but I think the fate of world and the future of the human race is involved in preventing a nuclear war.	0
ClaimBuster	17243	That's how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world.	1
ClaimBuster	17244	Senator Kennedy also indicated with regard to Cuba that he thought that I had made a mistake when I was in Cuba in not calling for free elections in that country.	1
ClaimBuster	17245	I'm happy to answer the question.	0
ClaimBuster	17246	I hope itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about wealthy people.	0
ClaimBuster	17247	Well, in the first place, I believe that character is a part of being president.	0
ClaimBuster	17248	She asked a question, I think, is whether the health care profession was to blame.	0
ClaimBuster	17249	And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened.	1
ClaimBuster	17250	This is a relevant question here tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	17251	This manual -- several thousands of which were produced -- was distributed, ordering political assassinations, hiring of criminals, and other forms of terrorism.	1
ClaimBuster	17252	Let me just talk to you about one of the short-term fixes.	0
ClaimBuster	17253	And yet he tells you he's for a middle- class tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	17254	We want to see that they do have adequate medical care.	0
ClaimBuster	17255	Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.	0
ClaimBuster	17256	Some desperate child needs to have somebody put their arm around them and say, we love you.	0
ClaimBuster	17257	How strong is our economy?	0
ClaimBuster	17258	And tomorrow night on NBC, from 10:30 to 11 Eastern, we're going to talk about how you pay the debt down, so we're going to come right down to that one.	1
ClaimBuster	17259	I did not support the war in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	17260	And you shouldn't have to apologize for wanting to keep all you can of it.	0
ClaimBuster	17261	They just need the help to be trained.	0
ClaimBuster	17262	One of the big differences between Senator Dole and myself is that I told you how I'm going to pay for every penny of the tax cuts I recommend and we've worked hard to bring this deficit down and that's helped people in the real estate business because the interest rates are lower.	1
ClaimBuster	17263	We're blessed with terrific soldiers, and extraordinary technology and intelligence.	0
ClaimBuster	17264	No prescription drug benefits, no drug therapy, no preventative medicines, no vision care.	0
ClaimBuster	17265	or 15 months ago, on what he believed in.	0
ClaimBuster	17266	I think we ought to raise the age at which a juvenile can carry a handgun from 18 to 21.	0
ClaimBuster	17267	He's been in office two years, and there has been absolutely no progress made toward a new SALT agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	17268	Mr. Bush has been critical of me for that, but I think those are the kinds of tough choices you have to make.	0
ClaimBuster	17269	Now, here's what I believe.	0
ClaimBuster	17270	You've proposed an approach that has a...	0
ClaimBuster	17271	And if we do that, then we have the ability to be able to respond more rapidly.	0
ClaimBuster	17272	At the last debate, we heard Donald talking about what he did to women.	1
ClaimBuster	17273	I wouldn't deal with Arafat, because I felt like he had let the former president down, and I don't think he's the kind of person that can lead toward a Palestinian state.	0
ClaimBuster	17274	And they provide us energy and they provide us innovation and they start companies like Intel and Google.	1
ClaimBuster	17275	We've got to be a nation blessed with a defense capability that's efficient, tough, capable, well organized, narrowly focused - fighting capability.	0
ClaimBuster	17276	I'll give you an example.	0
ClaimBuster	17277	And I think it's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.	0
ClaimBuster	17278	And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.	0
ClaimBuster	17279	Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place.	0
ClaimBuster	17280	And in his short career, he does not understand our national security challenges.	0
ClaimBuster	17281	The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.	0
ClaimBuster	17282	In ruling out the defense of Korea, they invited aggression in that area.	0
ClaimBuster	17283	Any proposals that I made at that time were at the request of the chairman, a Democrat, of one of the leading committees, who said we have to do something before the program goes broke and the checks bounce.	1
ClaimBuster	17284	We have to obviously cut spending.	0
ClaimBuster	17285	The Soviet Union is still jamming Radio Free Europe - Radio - uh- uh - Radio Free Europe is being jammed.	1
ClaimBuster	17286	Governor Carter uh - brags about the unemployment during Democratic administrations and condemns the unemployment at the present time.	0
ClaimBuster	17287	When it comes to community colleges, we are setting up programs, including with Nassau Community College, to retrain workers, including young people who may have dropped out of school but now are getting another chance, training them for the jobs that exist right now.	1
ClaimBuster	17288	So we've -- we've seen progress even under Republican control of the House of Representatives.	0
ClaimBuster	17289	I have suggested that the president should be given other weapons to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strikes beyond the injunction provision of the Taft-Hartley Act.	1
ClaimBuster	17290	If we can't meet with our friends, I don't know how we're going to lead the world in terms of dealing with critical issues like terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	17291	Well, maybe we'll give three or three or four or five or something.	0
ClaimBuster	17292	We recognize that there are places of conflict in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	17293	And they want it because they've understood from the beginning that when we open doors, we're all stronger, just as we were at the Olympics.	0
ClaimBuster	17294	You're a cardiologist, it wouldn't affect you.	1
ClaimBuster	17295	Well, two leading national news networks have both said the president's characterization of my health-care plan is incorrect.	1
ClaimBuster	17296	Strength is imperative for peace, but the two must go hand in hand.	0
ClaimBuster	17297	We also have to make the economy fairer.	0
ClaimBuster	17298	If you've got health insurance through your employer, you can keep your health insurance, keep your choice of doctor, keep your plan.	1
ClaimBuster	17299	Was this really going to war as a last resort?	0
ClaimBuster	17300	Now, when it comes to the issue of the environment, this is one of the worst administrations in modern history.	0
ClaimBuster	17301	I would like the record to show the panelists that Ross Perot took the first shot at the press.	0
ClaimBuster	17302	I am questioning his judgment on these matters, or where he's coming from He has every right to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	17303	We don't have the S&L crisis anymore.	1
ClaimBuster	17304	We've turned the country upside down.	0
ClaimBuster	17305	I went for one tax increase and when I make a mistake I admit it.	1
ClaimBuster	17306	So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?	0
ClaimBuster	17307	We have provided humanitarian assistance and we are helping the opposition organize, and we're particularly interested in making sure that we're mobilizing the moderate forces inside of Syria.	1
ClaimBuster	17308	As a matter of fact, I visited Poland, Yugoslavia and Rumania to make certain that the people of those countries understood that the president of the United States and the people of the United are dedicated to their independence, their autonomy and their freedom.	1
ClaimBuster	17309	I don't think you should support the death penalty to seek revenge.	0
ClaimBuster	17310	There is a huge difference in this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	17311	That stands in stark contrast, by the way, to a man who is going to leave 50 million -- 50 million Americans out of tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	17312	The only point I want to make is this, that in order to make those tough decisions we have to know what our values are and who we're fighting for and what our priorities are and if we are spending $300 billion on tax cuts for people who don't need them and weren't even asking for them, and we are leaving out health care which is crushing on people all across the country, then I think we have made a bad decision and I want to make sure we're not shortchanging our long term priorities.	0
ClaimBuster	17313	There was a Communist dictator that we inherited from the previous Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	17314	We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want -- and President Obama and whoever was working on it -- they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies.	1
ClaimBuster	17315	As I look at Cuba today, I believe that we are following the right course, a course which is difficult but a course which under the circumstance is the only proper one which will see that the Cuban people get a chance to realize their aspirations of progress through freedom and that they get that with our cooperation with the other organi- of the states in the Organization of American States.	0
ClaimBuster	17316	And in terms of peace, we are on the right track.	0
ClaimBuster	17317	Whenever you get a large rally of 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 people, you're going to have some fringe peoples.	0
ClaimBuster	17318	It's being worked now in 1700 communities -- bypassed Congress on this one, Ross -- 1700 communities across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	17319	Uh - On the one hand, for example, he suggests that as far as his medical care program is concerned that that really isn't a problem because it's from Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	17320	"Human rights are not advanced when, at the same time, you then stand back and say, ""Whoops, we didn't know the gun was loaded,'' and you have another totalitarian power on your hands."	0
ClaimBuster	17321	Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage.	1
ClaimBuster	17322	But we have horrible deals.	0
ClaimBuster	17323	"I think mother ought to whisper to Johnny and to Susie, as they button their coats in the morning and leave for the classroom, ""Be sure to say a prayer before you start your day's work."""	0
ClaimBuster	17324	Mali has been taken over, the northern part of Mali by al-Qaeda type individuals.	1
ClaimBuster	17325	And as president, I will always respect everybody's right to practice religion as they choose -- or not to practice -- because that's part of America.	0
ClaimBuster	17326	But the point is it's going to have to be somebody who inspires trust and confidence.	0
ClaimBuster	17327	I know what thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like when an army is defeated.	0
ClaimBuster	17328	But I will tell you, she's all talk.	0
ClaimBuster	17329	It won't take miracles and it won't happen overnight, but we can do much, much better if we have the courage to change.	0
ClaimBuster	17330	All of these things we can do as Americans and we can take on this mission and we can overcome it.	0
ClaimBuster	17331	But, you should pay attention to this campaign, because Governor Romney has made some commitments as well.	0
ClaimBuster	17332	No, we'll get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	17333	Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education.	0
ClaimBuster	17334	It's going to be a big, big opportunity for a lot of people.	0
ClaimBuster	17335	I think the support prices are tied to the average market price of the last three years, which was Mr. Benson's theory.	1
ClaimBuster	17336	That's the best overall energy policy in the brief time we have to discuss it.	0
ClaimBuster	17337	Now, throwing money at the problem is not the answer.	0
ClaimBuster	17338	When you total up all the federal spending he wants to do, it's the largest increase in federal spending in years.	1
ClaimBuster	17339	Now last year, of course, was 1958.	1
ClaimBuster	17340	I agree with Governor Bush that we should have new accountability, testing of students.	0
ClaimBuster	17341	In the case of the product liability bill, which they passed and I vetoed, I think that's what he's talking about, I actually wanted to sign that bill.	1
ClaimBuster	17342	And that composite now is going to be built around the bridges on the Santa Monica Freeway to help minimize the impact of earthquakes and create more jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	17343	We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now.	0
ClaimBuster	17344	Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe.	0
ClaimBuster	17345	You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him.	0
ClaimBuster	17346	It isn't an issue with Mr. Nixon, who now says that he also supports the Eisenhower policy.	1
ClaimBuster	17347	And secondly, the people that murdered Mr. Byrd got the ultimate punishment.	1
ClaimBuster	17348	We have to get our economy going.	0
ClaimBuster	17349	If you ask me if I could fly a fighter plane or be an astronaut, I can't.	0
ClaimBuster	17350	The state then could determine whether the money would be spent for school construction or teacher salaries.	0
ClaimBuster	17351	And the number of small businesses I've gone to that are saying they're dropping insurance because they can't afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive.	1
ClaimBuster	17352	This is a nation, which, if it falls apart, if it -- if it becomes a failed state, there are nuclear weapons there and you've got -- you've got terrorists there who could grab their -- their hands onto those nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	17353	We can't deal with them.	0
ClaimBuster	17354	When Ronald Reagan won the Texas primary election, Mr. Ford added back another one and a half billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	17355	Are we doing enough in that area?	0
ClaimBuster	17356	Indeed, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 10 to 0, with seven abstentions, against the SALT II treaty, and declared that it was not in the national security interests of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	17357	The president reneged on his promise to fund No Child Left Behind.	1
ClaimBuster	17358	The mission must be clear.	0
ClaimBuster	17359	"I asked: ""Are you better off than you were 4 years before?''"	0
ClaimBuster	17360	I visited a Jeep plant, oldest plant in America, a plant in Toledo, Ohio, where they're going to export 41,000 right hand drive Jeeps this year, and they've got 700 new jobs because of it.	1
ClaimBuster	17361	But just briefly, the Clinton Foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with HIV-AIDS to afford treatment, and that's about half all the people in the world who are getting treatment.	1
ClaimBuster	17362	And that's going to require more than is on the table today.	0
ClaimBuster	17363	Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers.	1
ClaimBuster	17364	Making sure that CEOs are not enriching themselves through this process.	0
ClaimBuster	17365	But I do not think that it was an example of a conflict where we should have put our troops in to try to separate the parties for this reason, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	17366	And the concentration of employment opportunities in those areas would help greatly not only to reestablish the tax base, but also to help reduce the extraordinary welfare cost.	0
ClaimBuster	17367	Congress passed a paperwork reduction act.	1
ClaimBuster	17368	And that's in all sections of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	17369	Lower crime rates for eight years in a row.	1
ClaimBuster	17370	Everybody says you can't do that with Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	17371	And when you are reducing productivity at the same time that you are turning out printing-press money in excessive amounts, you're causing inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	17372	We should try to reduce these circumstances.	0
ClaimBuster	17373	It's ironic that there are now -- there is now a smaller percentage of the voters made up of parents with children than ever in American history because of the aging of our population, but at the same time we've got the largest generation of students in public schools ever.	1
ClaimBuster	17374	We've been around for 240 years.	1
ClaimBuster	17375	We have the best health care delivery system in the world and we want to keep it that way.	0
ClaimBuster	17376	I disagree completely with Senator Kennedy on this point.	0
ClaimBuster	17377	That's the plan that I've put forward.	0
ClaimBuster	17378	And we can do it, but we're going to have to make an investment.	0
ClaimBuster	17379	(Laughter) I'm against that; I oppose that.	0
ClaimBuster	17380	33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she's saying there wasn't anything wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	17381	There was a study just a few weeks ago suggesting that in summertime the north polar ice cap will be completely gone in 50 years.	1
ClaimBuster	17382	They also have the Haqqani Network and the Taliban existent within their country.	1
ClaimBuster	17383	Or, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income.	1
ClaimBuster	17384	And we will never take military options off the table.	0
ClaimBuster	17385	Because the fundamentals of the economy were weak even before this latest crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	17386	And what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more.	1
ClaimBuster	17387	This was a bipartisan idea.	1
ClaimBuster	17388	Yes, we're having tough times, but we do not need to go back to the failed policies of the past, when you had a Democratic president and a spendthrift Democratic Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	17389	He said he thought Saddam Hussein was a grave threat, and now he said it was a mistake to remove Saddam Hussein from power.	1
ClaimBuster	17390	When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately.	1
ClaimBuster	17391	I think in those days after 9/11, I thought the president did a terrific job.	0
ClaimBuster	17392	Two is to say if you want to access reading money, you can do so.	0
ClaimBuster	17393	That's the same percentage that it was twenty years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	17394	In addition to military strength, we need to see that the economy of this country continues to grow.	0
ClaimBuster	17395	Now Governor Carter complains about the deficits that uh - uh - this administration has had.	0
ClaimBuster	17396	We have to bring back law and order.	0
ClaimBuster	17397	We all know about the vote held this week - of the five neutralists - and it was generally regarded as a defeat for the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	17398	I believe that the American people, if given the leadership that I would expect to give, would be willing to give this thrust to preserve the peace and the necessary restraint at home to hold the lid on spending so that we could, I think, have a long overdue and totally justified tax decrease for the middle-income people.	0
ClaimBuster	17399	(Applause) And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	17400	I -- I think interesting the president just said something which -- which is that on the day after the attack he went into the Rose Garden and said that this was an act of terror.	1
ClaimBuster	17401	I'm not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say this is the way it's got to be.	0
ClaimBuster	17402	You know, every life is precious.	0
ClaimBuster	17403	I hope a lot of --	0
ClaimBuster	17404	The rest, as to whether the lands are going to be opened in the next five years or so - we're already five years behind in what we should be doing.	0
ClaimBuster	17405	So these are the ways that we can restore the strength of our country, and they don't require long experience in foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	17406	He thinks, I think he said, that the country is coming apart at the seams.	0
ClaimBuster	17407	Their idea was a budget that the that the American Hospital Association said could close 700 hospitals.	1
ClaimBuster	17408	Uh - Mr. McGee, there are about a hundred and four commodities that have some kind of depletion allowance - different kind of minerals, including oil.	1
ClaimBuster	17409	We'll never have that world leadership until we are strong at home, and we can have that strength if we return to the basic principles.	0
ClaimBuster	17410	We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason: we want higher teachers' salaries.	1
ClaimBuster	17411	I suggest, however, that in the interest of fairness that he could give me the benefit of also believing as he believes.	0
ClaimBuster	17412	I have advocated expansions of public school choice alternatives and I said the creation of 3,000 new schools that we are going to help the states to finance.	1
ClaimBuster	17413	It means keeping America even stronger militarily than she is.	0
ClaimBuster	17414	And it's going to take all the nations together, just as when we banded together we pretty much resolved the whole problem of skyjackings sometime ago.	1
ClaimBuster	17415	He proposed more than Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis combined.	1
ClaimBuster	17416	One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash.	1
ClaimBuster	17417	It opposed all of the programs of President Roosevelt and others - the minimum wage and for housing and economic growth and development of our natural resources, the Tennessee Valley and all the rest.	1
ClaimBuster	17418	I've thought a lot about that particular question, and I see our greatest national strength coming from what we stand for in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	17419	In all those elements, Governor Reagan has repeatedly spoken out against them, which, to me, shows a very great insensitivity to giving deprived families a better chance in life.	1
ClaimBuster	17420	I would use pressure and diplomacy.	0
ClaimBuster	17421	But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.	1
ClaimBuster	17422	I am eternally optimistic, and I happen to believe that we've made great progress from the days when I was young and when this country didn't even know it had a racial problem.	0
ClaimBuster	17423	But when we make this into a divisive political issue, and when we don't have bipartisan support -- I can deliver, Governor, a whole bunch of Democrats to get comprehensive immigration reform done, and we can't...	0
ClaimBuster	17424	She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't -- maybe it was.	0
ClaimBuster	17425	The president's not getting the job done.	0
ClaimBuster	17426	Thank you, well, first let me say that I signed the Family Leave Act.	1
ClaimBuster	17427	Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	17428	I can do a better job of waging a smarter, more effective war on terror and guarantee that we will go after the terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	17429	So that I'm hopeful we can try once more.	0
ClaimBuster	17430	Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we're actually going to look at the facts.	1
ClaimBuster	17431	And I take it back, because I think -- he said he made a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	17432	Now then, that money needs to be -- they don't even pay interest on it.	1
ClaimBuster	17433	but after a decade of war, I think we all recognize we've got to do some nation building here at home, rebuilding our roads, our bridges and especially caring for our Veterans who sacrificed so much for our freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	17434	Where did you find this?	0
ClaimBuster	17435	We have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years.	1
ClaimBuster	17436	Well, I don't know in the case of the trial lawyers.	0
ClaimBuster	17437	He talks about peace and I'm thankful for peace.	0
ClaimBuster	17438	In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born.	1
ClaimBuster	17439	I don't think a president can do that.	0
ClaimBuster	17440	Each of those countries is independent, autonomous: it has its own territorial integrity and the United States does not concede that those countries are under the domination of the Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	17441	And I know talks have started again today.	1
ClaimBuster	17442	I believe that it's in our interest and in the interest of Israel and Iran, and Saudi Arabia, for the United States to sell arms to those countries.	0
ClaimBuster	17443	Well, it isn't going to go back up.	0
ClaimBuster	17444	I have proposed a budget which would put ten years on the life of the Medicare trust fund.	1
ClaimBuster	17445	It shouldn't happen in America.	0
ClaimBuster	17446	It might help the contributions from coming in from Indonesia or other foreign countries, rich people in those countries, and then being sent back after the L.A. Times discovers it, $250,000.	0
ClaimBuster	17447	He cut 112 billion dollars, so we're right on the edge right now.	1
ClaimBuster	17448	Again, it may not work, but if it doesn't work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned.	0
ClaimBuster	17449	As he pointed out, we came to the Congress in the same year.	1
ClaimBuster	17450	I like PBS, I love Big Bird.	0
ClaimBuster	17451	Let me start with the Pell Grants.	0
ClaimBuster	17452	We're having trouble meeting recruiting goals.	0
ClaimBuster	17453	Now, John's been in the Congress for 20 years.	1
ClaimBuster	17454	No, I might as well just go with -- --	0
ClaimBuster	17455	And I don't appreciate it when a candidate for president denigrates the contributions of these brave soldiers.	0
ClaimBuster	17456	We've got 1,000 more Border Patrol agents on the southern border.	1
ClaimBuster	17457	The problem I have with the Perot prescription is that almost all economists who've looked at it say that if you cut the deficit this much this quick it will increase unemployment, it will slow down the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	17458	So we can't simply drill our way out of the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	17459	Because of our programs we have been able to significantly cut defense spending.	1
ClaimBuster	17460	I think Mr. Perot put his finger on something there.	0
ClaimBuster	17461	I think we ought to seriously consider with the exceptions of caring for our veterans national defense and several other vital issues.	0
ClaimBuster	17462	And she won't even mention the word and nor will President Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	17463	So far, it is only a beginning.	0
ClaimBuster	17464	(LAUGHTER) But for those who have not made up their mind, I would like to conclude by this promise.	0
ClaimBuster	17465	And natural gas isn't just appearing magically.	0
ClaimBuster	17466	We can't settle for anything but the best.	0
ClaimBuster	17467	And I like, I like Senator Dole, you can probably tell we like each other.	0
ClaimBuster	17468	On the other hand, I don't think that we have any reason to believe that the dimensions of this crisis are anywhere near as great as the savings and loan crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	17469	I think I was on the advisory committee, Margaret.	1
ClaimBuster	17470	It's crooked -- she's -- she's guilty of a very, very serious crime.	1
ClaimBuster	17471	I've been critical of the Administration's failure to suggest policies which would make it possible for us to establish, for example, closer relations with Poland, particularly after the fifty-five-fifty-six period and the Hungarian revolution.	1
ClaimBuster	17472	That is a multi-year project.	1
ClaimBuster	17473	It is part of my consciousness and of my commitment to continue this progress.	0
ClaimBuster	17474	So as soon as we found out that the Benghazi consulate was being overrun, I was on the phone with my national security team and I gave them three instructions.	1
ClaimBuster	17475	That's what we call a sequester.	0
ClaimBuster	17476	Because there is a major problem there.	0
ClaimBuster	17477	That is why President Eisenhower was correct in not apologizing or expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev at the Paris Conference, as Senator Kennedy suggested he could have done.	0
ClaimBuster	17478	But the point is that I know how to handle these crises.	0
ClaimBuster	17479	The dollar's gone through the floor.	0
ClaimBuster	17480	And that's one of the reasons why it's in our interest.	0
ClaimBuster	17481	Firmness but no belligerence, and by no belligerence I mean that we do not answer insult by insult.	0
ClaimBuster	17482	Talk is cheap; words are plentiful, deeds are precious.	0
ClaimBuster	17483	The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession.	0
ClaimBuster	17484	On the neutralists' resolution, which we were so much opposed to, the same thing happened.	1
ClaimBuster	17485	He puts no real assets into the Social Security system.	0
ClaimBuster	17486	But if I am entrusted with the presidency, it will be the first Civil Rights Act of the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	17487	We've been blessed by having a nation that's free and prosperous thanks to the contributions of the greatest generation.	0
ClaimBuster	17488	Out in the west, yeah.	0
ClaimBuster	17489	I don't know what was right, or what was wrong, or what was done.	0
ClaimBuster	17490	This administration, by going into the Star Wars system, is going to add a dangerous new escalation.	0
ClaimBuster	17491	I know how these people think.	0
ClaimBuster	17492	Because that's one of the most critical issues here: North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	17493	Bill Ayers is a professor of education in Chicago.	1
ClaimBuster	17494	[Laughter] I'm going to use my time a little differently.	0
ClaimBuster	17495	In America, on basic moral questions we have always let the people decide in their own personal lives.	0
ClaimBuster	17496	I'm going to rebuild our military power.	0
ClaimBuster	17497	Now, when we have a presidential candidate, for example - Senator Kennedy - stating over and over again that the United States is second in space and the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight - we've had twenty-eight successful shots, they've had eight; when he states that we're second in education, and I have seen Soviet education and I've seen ours, and we're not; that we're second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall we're way ahead of the Soviet Union and all other countries in science; when he says as he did in January of this year that we have the worst slums, that we have the most crowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night; when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige?	1
ClaimBuster	17498	We can do better, and we must.	0
ClaimBuster	17499	But he also made sure that there was a bipartisan support.	0
ClaimBuster	17500	So to answer your question, I would hope we never have to.	0
ClaimBuster	17501	They're stronger now than at any time since 2001.	1
ClaimBuster	17502	We have made sure that they are isolated.	1
ClaimBuster	17503	I noticed recently that Governor Reagan frequently quotes Democratic presidents in his acceptance address.	1
ClaimBuster	17504	I want to cut that business tax.	0
ClaimBuster	17505	You look at North Korea where they have enough plutonium to build six nuclear bombs.	1
ClaimBuster	17506	And let's -- you know, let's be clear about what he is saying and what that means.	0
ClaimBuster	17507	I'd like to see a balanced budget amendment for America, to protect the American taxpayers, and then that would discipline not only the executive branch but the spending Congress, the Congress that's been in control of one party, his party, for 38 years.	1
ClaimBuster	17508	That's why I support a teacher liability act at the federal level, that says if a teacher or principal upholds reasonable standards of classroom discipline they can't be sued.	1
ClaimBuster	17509	That's why I want to get these debts down and these interest rates down, restore America's exports, help rural America, which is suffering so much, and bring the jobs back here for our children.	0
ClaimBuster	17510	Now, these are all positions of the ACLU.	0
ClaimBuster	17511	The president bears the constitutional responsibility, not the secretary of state, for the conduct of foreign affairs.	1
ClaimBuster	17512	But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception.	0
ClaimBuster	17513	And the first voter was a 19-year-old woman.	1
ClaimBuster	17514	Now she's blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln.	1
ClaimBuster	17515	I have made the cause of children and families really my life's work.	0
ClaimBuster	17516	I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	17517	Now America has been carrying a tremendous load in this respect.	0
ClaimBuster	17518	I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.	0
ClaimBuster	17519	After my plan is in place, the wealthiest Americans will pay a higher percentage of taxes then they do today, the poorest of Americans, six million families, won't pay any tax at all.	1
ClaimBuster	17520	Well, actually, he forgot Poland.	1
ClaimBuster	17521	I know Senator Kennedy suggested in his speech at Cleveland yesterday that that committee had not been particularly effective.	1
ClaimBuster	17522	The man who may be developing weapons of mass destruction, we don't know because inspectors aren't in.	1
ClaimBuster	17523	I can't emphasize to you how much.	0
ClaimBuster	17524	I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	17525	But fully, my short range answer is fully fund that McKinney Act.	0
ClaimBuster	17526	"But the Washington Post ran a long editorial today saying they couldn't believe Mr. Bush was making character an issue and they said he was the greatest quote ""political chameleon"" for changing his positions of all times."	1
ClaimBuster	17527	So we have a long history of having a lot of talented women.	1
ClaimBuster	17528	The whole premise behind Senator Obama's plans are class warfare, let's spread the wealth around.	1
ClaimBuster	17529	But let me comment on the report.	0
ClaimBuster	17530	No one from Arizona is against solar.	1
ClaimBuster	17531	I've had a strong record of working with Democrats and Republicans in Texas to make sure no child is left behind.	1
ClaimBuster	17532	Our opponents say, things are okay.	0
ClaimBuster	17533	And I think that's where maybe the vice president and I begin to have some differences.	0
ClaimBuster	17534	Meanwhile, while Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons, some 37 tons of what they called yellow cake, the stuff they use to make enriched uranium, while they're doing that, North Korea has moved from one bomb maybe, maybe, to four to seven bombs.	1
ClaimBuster	17535	There's nothing wrong with that.	0
ClaimBuster	17536	It has not been standing still.	0
ClaimBuster	17537	And the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class.	1
ClaimBuster	17538	The Mideast is very difficult.	0
ClaimBuster	17539	The book you mentioned that Vice President Gore wrote, he also called for taxing -- big energy taxes in order to clean up the environment.	1
ClaimBuster	17540	So what is the answer?	0
ClaimBuster	17541	A 1% increase in interest rates in that $2.8 trillion is $28 billion a year.	1
ClaimBuster	17542	They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people.	1
ClaimBuster	17543	This is a major problem facing America.	0
ClaimBuster	17544	We have to keep the drugs out of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	17545	I spend a good deal of time talking to young people, and in my standard speech out there on the stump I usually end my speech by saying, I want to ask you for something and I want to direct it especially to the young people in the audience.	1
ClaimBuster	17546	First of all, what kind of mixed message does it send when you have $500 million going over to Iraq to put police officers in the streets of Iraq, and the president is cutting the COPS program in America?	1
ClaimBuster	17547	So he's got the oil and gas part, but he doesn't have the clean energy part.	1
ClaimBuster	17548	And all of those things happened because the Philippines do crave democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	17549	I worked with Senator Mitchell, who played me, I guess, in the debate warmup.	1
ClaimBuster	17550	We're in an information age when learning is more important than ever.	0
ClaimBuster	17551	That's what we did in Haiti.	1
ClaimBuster	17552	We can do better than that, particularly in Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	17553	I don't think he'll be reelected because trickle down economics is a failure and he's offering more of it, and what he's saying about my program is just not true.	1
ClaimBuster	17554	And may I make an observation - part of the question you asked, Mr. Trewhitt?	0
ClaimBuster	17555	But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices.	1
ClaimBuster	17556	And the way I view it is there's a lot of entrenched special interests there, people who are, you know, on one side of the issue or another and they spend enormous sums of money and they convince different senators to taut their way or different congressmen to talk about their issue, and they dig in.	0
ClaimBuster	17557	It is terrible to bus tiny little children across town.	0
ClaimBuster	17558	Well, I would say first of all that Senator's - Kennedy's statement that he's just made is not going to help our Gallup Polls abroad and it isn't going to help our prestige either.	0
ClaimBuster	17559	We've gained manufacturing jobs since I've been President.	1
ClaimBuster	17560	And that means that the ordinary American out there who's collecting a paycheck every day, they've got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them.	0
ClaimBuster	17561	I've got 5.5 million hard-working people who put me on the ballot, and I belong to them.	1
ClaimBuster	17562	Everyone in this room, practically, here tonight, is an immigrant.	1
ClaimBuster	17563	But I'm going to create a -- the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry.	0
ClaimBuster	17564	Bob, thank you very much.	0
ClaimBuster	17565	So, she's allowed to do that, but I'm not allowed to respond?	0
ClaimBuster	17566	Well, Mr. Kraft, uh - I violently disagree with your assessment.	0
ClaimBuster	17567	And this decision you're about to make better be about what kind of economic theory you want, not just people saying I'm going to go fix it but what are we going to do?	0
ClaimBuster	17568	He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions.	0
ClaimBuster	17569	We have men and women wearing our uniform in substandard housing.	1
ClaimBuster	17570	Let me just say that obviously tonight we're going to hear some phony numbers about what I think and what we ought to do.	0
ClaimBuster	17571	And I've already made a proposal - and yes, it will cost some money.	0
ClaimBuster	17572	Should we have listened to my opponent who wanted to send the UN into the Persian Gulf or in spite of the mistakes of the past, are we doing better there?	1
ClaimBuster	17573	We don't take care of our veterans.	0
ClaimBuster	17574	Now there is a the democratically elected president in Haiti.	1
ClaimBuster	17575	And since that day, our nation has been on a multi-pronged strategy to keep our country safer.	1
ClaimBuster	17576	Thank goodness the networks have a fact check so I don't have to just go blue in the face anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	17577	But what I won't do is change my core values because of politics or because of pressure.	0
ClaimBuster	17578	It's not much fun sometimes.	0
ClaimBuster	17579	Three weeks from now -- 2 weeks from tomorrow, America goes to the polls and you're going to have to decide who you want to lead this country to economic recovery.	0
ClaimBuster	17580	We didn't fund a lot of other things this year, like the savings and loan mess.	1
ClaimBuster	17581	But ultimately, Syrians are going to have to determine their own future.	0
ClaimBuster	17582	I also have a plan to win the war on terror, funding homeland security, strengthening our military, cutting our finances, reaching out to the world, again building strong alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	17583	Republican governors as well as Democratic governors.	0
ClaimBuster	17584	We later said no, that's not true.	1
ClaimBuster	17585	I'm for getting rid of the death tax, completely getting rid of the death tax.	0
ClaimBuster	17586	This is the problem I have with the big spending liberals.	0
ClaimBuster	17587	New world order to me means freedom and democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	17588	You can't -- but you can't have the president just lay out a whole series of items without giving me a chance to respond.	0
ClaimBuster	17589	Well, first of all, I think it's important to tell you that we did come in during some tough times.	0
ClaimBuster	17590	And I don't believe she does have the stamina.	0
ClaimBuster	17591	I think that would be a very serious mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	17592	... which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't.	0
ClaimBuster	17593	We're the richest country on the face of the planet, the only industrialized nation in the world not to do it.	1
ClaimBuster	17594	Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio.	1
ClaimBuster	17595	We've got more money going out for local police than any previous administration.	1
ClaimBuster	17596	We are mortgaging our children's future.	0
ClaimBuster	17597	Uh - I will say simply, in advance of it, that I believe that in this area, the laws which should be passed uh - as far as the big national emergency strikes are concerned, are ones that will give the president more weapons with which to deal with those strikes.	0
ClaimBuster	17598	Medicare is for seniors, who many of them are on fixed income, to lift them out of poverty.	1
ClaimBuster	17599	I'm meeting folks all over the country.	1
ClaimBuster	17600	And we talk about evidence.	0
ClaimBuster	17601	Health-care costs are on the rise because the consumers are not involved in the decision-making process.	1
ClaimBuster	17602	For the first time in the 20th century the President has done that in all four years and that's why I don't want to see us blow a big hole in the deficit with a tax program we can't pay for, so your interest rates will go up, and you'll have to pay back in higher interest rates what you allegedly will get in a tax cut, so I say keep working on expanding the markets.	1
ClaimBuster	17603	The removal of Russian troops from the Baltics.	0
ClaimBuster	17604	And while I have a last word here, I would like to correct a misstatement of fact by the President.	0
ClaimBuster	17605	And then let's take the last one, championing small business.	0
ClaimBuster	17606	And therefore, wealthy people are going to get it.	0
ClaimBuster	17607	Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places.	0
ClaimBuster	17608	Senator Obama had the opening.	0
ClaimBuster	17609	How many leaders in the world today would respond to us, as a result of what we've done, in that way?	0
ClaimBuster	17610	And that's where our society must head if we're going to be a peaceful and prosperous society.	0
ClaimBuster	17611	I see people in my state, middle class people -- their taxes have gone up in Washington and their services have gone down while the wealthy have gotten tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	17612	We've got fundamental problems in the system.	1
ClaimBuster	17613	That would mean, of course, that for a family of four that that family would have a thousand dollars more personal exemption - money that they could spend for their own purposes, money that the government wouldn't have to spend.	1
ClaimBuster	17614	And the problem is, with Governments - Federal, State and Local - taking $.44 out of every dollar earned, that the Federal Government has pre-empted too many of the tax sources, and that the cities.	1
ClaimBuster	17615	And so what we're seeing is a pretty dramatic reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region.	0
ClaimBuster	17616	This is a movement that came from the people.	1
ClaimBuster	17617	I'd like to start by telling you what my vision is.	0
ClaimBuster	17618	And believe me, if you knew my family and if you knew the private life I have, you would agree in a minute that that's a whole lot more fun than getting involved in politics.	0
ClaimBuster	17619	I will tell you this: I will not give anyone special treatment and I will strictly adhere to the law.	0
ClaimBuster	17620	I agree with that, John.	0
ClaimBuster	17621	I want to remind you that it wasn't just my administration that made the decision on safety.	1
ClaimBuster	17622	We have weakened our capacity to project power around the world because we have viewed everything through this single lens, not to mention, look at our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	17623	So the fact is that Senator Obama is spending unprecedented -- unprecedented in the history of American politics, going back to the beginning, amounts of money in negative attack ads on me.	1
ClaimBuster	17624	I don't want to cut our commitment to education.	0
ClaimBuster	17625	I served for eight years in the United States Senate and served on the Armed Services Committee.	1
ClaimBuster	17626	We've got an energy bill on the Senate floor right now that contains some good stuff, some stuff you want, including drilling off-shore, but you're opposed to it because it would strip away those tax breaks that have gone to oil companies.	1
ClaimBuster	17627	Now, whether it's character or judgment -- whatever it is -- I have a big difference here on this issue and so we'll just have to see how it plays out.	0
ClaimBuster	17628	It had been cut in two by President Gerald Ford.	1
ClaimBuster	17629	And finally, sir, to answer your question, you need somebody in office who will tell the truth.	0
ClaimBuster	17630	But going back to Libya -- because this is an example of how we make choices.	0
ClaimBuster	17631	We end up being problem solvers.	0
ClaimBuster	17632	Every year Congress and the president sign laws that make us do more things and gives us less money to do it with.	1
ClaimBuster	17633	And you got to be careful here, because there's a safety factor, but I think these things - and then also I am one who believes we've got to go the extra mile in clean - being sure that that blood supply is pure.	0
ClaimBuster	17634	That's why we opposed the government take over health care plan that President Clinton tried and tried and tried to get through Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	17635	You could knock out the tax increases and you could do what the people want, and that's create enterprise zones.	0
ClaimBuster	17636	And I am going to be a president who is serious, I hope and expect will be liked by the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	17637	Tell Silvio Berlusconi we're going alone.	0
ClaimBuster	17638	So here's what my plan does.	0
ClaimBuster	17639	He voted twice for a budget resolution that increases the taxes on individuals making $42,000 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	17640	At the same time every year, it increased the amount of money -- virtually every year, there may have been one or two that were skipped in there -- that was subject to that tax.	1
ClaimBuster	17641	I have Blue Cross/Blue Shield.	1
ClaimBuster	17642	That's one of the major differences we have about defending our country.	0
ClaimBuster	17643	And I believe that, while all of the promises have been broken, they've never been carried out.	0
ClaimBuster	17644	But, at the end of the day, my friend, I have to tell you again, and you know what it's like to serve, and you know what it's like to sacrifice, but we can never allow a second Holocaust to take place.	0
ClaimBuster	17645	It was about emergencies, wasn't it?	0
ClaimBuster	17646	Finally, if we don't fix this, you're right.	0
ClaimBuster	17647	That's just what the president did when he vetoed the Family Leave Act.	1
ClaimBuster	17648	Folks, we can build that bridge to the 21st Century, big enough and strong enough for all of us to walk across, and I hope you will help me build it.	0
ClaimBuster	17649	You know, I've had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country.	1
ClaimBuster	17650	Russia is in part resurgent and Putin is feeling powerful because of petro-dollars, as Senator McCain mentioned.	1
ClaimBuster	17651	Now, Governor Romney talked about China, as I already indicated.	1
ClaimBuster	17652	And I'm hoping we can start some payments on it before we get through here.	0
ClaimBuster	17653	And recently when he was asked specifically about Iraq, he said there is nothing we can do about it.	1
ClaimBuster	17654	We need to indict Ahmadinejad.	0
ClaimBuster	17655	Israel is our friend and we'll stand by Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	17656	We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them.	0
ClaimBuster	17657	I would rather that a million come from our own hemisphere, our own country as opposed to Saddam Hussein.	0
ClaimBuster	17658	Those are the fuzzy math figures put together by some group that works for the campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	17659	You're 150 -- excuse me, I think it's a little more, about $100 million shy of what you ought to be under the No Child Left Behind Act to help your education system here.	1
ClaimBuster	17660	There's only been uh - a net savings of $4 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	17661	And today it's less than 1 percent, because we're working together to try to bring this deficit under control.	1
ClaimBuster	17662	And that's the tragedy of the Iran/Contra scandal.	0
ClaimBuster	17663	So you may end up getting a $5,000 tax credit.	0
ClaimBuster	17664	I believe in the balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	17665	I think we're both supportive of them and I would strongly lead in that area as I have in my state as Governor.	0
ClaimBuster	17666	In this particular area, I think the Vice President and I are in general agreement on what we have to do.	0
ClaimBuster	17667	They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years.	1
ClaimBuster	17668	We have -- our military, the morale is high.	0
ClaimBuster	17669	We've gone through a Great Depression in our lifetime that literally was worldwide and almost brought us to our knees.	1
ClaimBuster	17670	If the job were finished, I might have thought twice about seeking reelection for this job.	0
ClaimBuster	17671	And Iraq is going to be free, and America will be better off for it.	0
ClaimBuster	17672	And I think what I don't know is what all of us don't know, and that's what's going to happen both here at home and abroad.	0
ClaimBuster	17673	I see it as a question of values.	0
ClaimBuster	17674	The people need to take their government back.	0
ClaimBuster	17675	I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isn't dangerous and won't kill them and won't destroy their lives, get the message and change.	0
ClaimBuster	17676	And there are ways of doing it.	0
ClaimBuster	17677	She's a United States -- she was a United States senator.	1
ClaimBuster	17678	People don't dare -- medical practitioners, to help somebody along the highway that are hurt because they're afraid that some lawyer's going to come along and get a big lawsuit.	0
ClaimBuster	17679	Right now, because of previous agreements, some made by President Clinton, the goods and products that we send to Colombia, which is our largest agricultural importer of our products, is -- there's a billion dollars that we -- our businesses have paid so far in order to get our goods in there.	1
ClaimBuster	17680	In California, we made 37 billion dollars' worth of telecommunications equipment eligible for export for the first time.	1
ClaimBuster	17681	Not only would it threaten Israel, our strongest ally in the region and one of our strongest allies in the world, but it would also create a possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	17682	I think it's a very clear contrast.	0
ClaimBuster	17683	And I say a majority of the Republicans are opposed to it.	1
ClaimBuster	17684	This is a family tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	17685	The answer is that the United States can't afford to have a es- an es - a espionage lack or should we s- uh - lag - or should I say uh - an intelligence lag - any more than we can afford to have a missile lag.	0
ClaimBuster	17686	Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top.	0
ClaimBuster	17687	She's the one and Obama that caused the violence.	0
ClaimBuster	17688	There's no question in my mind that if the president were to be reelected you'll continue to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up.	0
ClaimBuster	17689	I wake up every day thinking about how best to protect America.	1
ClaimBuster	17690	When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster.	0
ClaimBuster	17691	I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people -- is it morally right?	0
ClaimBuster	17692	Uh - earlier, uh - Mr. Levi, his uh - attorney general, put forward a gun control proposal, which Mr. Ford later, I believe, espoused, that called for the prohibition against the uh sale aw- of the uh - so-called Saturday Night Specials.	1
ClaimBuster	17693	As a businessperson, I had to have -- I need to know the regulations.	0
ClaimBuster	17694	I want to make sure that we have the ships that are required by our Navy.	0
ClaimBuster	17695	I want to keep their taxes down on small business.	0
ClaimBuster	17696	It was personal e-mails, not official.	1
ClaimBuster	17697	I don't even have a seal yet.	1
ClaimBuster	17698	So I have a record.	1
ClaimBuster	17699	One is a path represented by the president, which at the end of four years would mean we'd have $20 trillion in debt heading towards Greece.	1
ClaimBuster	17700	That's all behind us now, and it should be behind us, and the forgotten war, the Korean War, but I guess I can just answer you very plainly, Jason.	0
ClaimBuster	17701	We have a very consistent policy in the Middle East: It is to support the peace process; to support the security of Israel; and to support those who are prepared to take risks for peace.	1
ClaimBuster	17702	He won't tell you because he can't.	0
ClaimBuster	17703	I believe there are 1.4 million children in Texas who do not have health insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	17704	Let's not raise taxes on anybody today.	0
ClaimBuster	17705	And, of course, we know that the Russians control other sources of energy into Europe, which they have used from time to time.	1
ClaimBuster	17706	Your own Council of Economic Advisers -- Mr. Feldstein in his report told you that.	1
ClaimBuster	17707	I think that's the big assignment, the big task, the big function of the federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	17708	It's impossible for mayors or governors to cooperate with the resident, because they can't anticipate what's gonna happen next.	0
ClaimBuster	17709	Freedom is on the march.	0
ClaimBuster	17710	I know these folks and I know their families.	1
ClaimBuster	17711	Well, he mentioned the debt.	1
ClaimBuster	17712	Well, there's a lot of stuff that was put out there, so let me try to address it.	0
ClaimBuster	17713	And we need to reverse that.	0
ClaimBuster	17714	You've got to do that; we got to get those costs down.	0
ClaimBuster	17715	I'm pledging I will not raise taxes; I'm giving a tax cut to the people earning less than $200,000 a year.	0
ClaimBuster	17716	I -- listen, I -- we've got a great country.	0
ClaimBuster	17717	Miss Quinn, I don't have to.	0
ClaimBuster	17718	But nobody was caring much about it.	0
ClaimBuster	17719	We -- as president, I will sit on day one -- actually, the day after I get elected -- I'll sit down with leaders -- the Democratic leaders, as well as Republican leaders, and continue -- as we did in my state -- we met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the -- in the -- in our state in that case.	1
ClaimBuster	17720	She gave us ISIS, because her and Obama created this huge vacuum, and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when -- we should never have been in Iraq, but once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out.	0
ClaimBuster	17721	Now, if these aren't special interests, I've got a lot to learn.	0
ClaimBuster	17722	The captains are leaving the service.	1
ClaimBuster	17723	I remember when Ronald Reagan was the president; he stood on principle.	0
ClaimBuster	17724	First of all, let me say he's not for a government-run health care system?	0
ClaimBuster	17725	I went to increase early childhood education and the notion that we should freeze that when there may be, for example, this Medicare subsidy, I think, doesn't make sense.	0
ClaimBuster	17726	I'd like to have what 43 governors have -- the line item veto, so if the Congress can't cut, and we've got a reckless spending Congress, let the president have a shot at it by wiping out things that are pork barrel or something of that nature.	1
ClaimBuster	17727	Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I'm reaching out to all Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone.	0
ClaimBuster	17728	Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton.	1
ClaimBuster	17729	I'm beginning to think not only did he invent the Internet, but he invented the calculator.	0
ClaimBuster	17730	We have to also stand by our allies.	0
ClaimBuster	17731	There's no certain road to the presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	17732	He suggested we pass an aid to education bill.	1
ClaimBuster	17733	The quality of the air's cleaner since I've been the president.	1
ClaimBuster	17734	We passed this year the most furthest looking transportation bill in the history of this country since Eisenhower started the interstate highways -- $150 billion for improving the infrastructure.	1
ClaimBuster	17735	Well, Prime Minister Allawi was here.	1
ClaimBuster	17736	When something happens that endangers our security, or when something happens that threatens our stature in the world, or when American people are endangered by the actions of a foreign country, uh - just forty uh sailors on the Mayaguez, we obviously have to move aggressively and quickly to rescue them.	0
ClaimBuster	17737	I disagree with the vice president on this issue.	0
ClaimBuster	17738	These are families that get hurt.	0
ClaimBuster	17739	Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account.	1
ClaimBuster	17740	I've been in them all my life.	1
ClaimBuster	17741	And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back.	0
ClaimBuster	17742	Also as far as religion is concerned.	0
ClaimBuster	17743	It was a bad decision for America and would have been bad for our future if I hadn't stopped it.	0
ClaimBuster	17744	What I want to do is change the dynamics on the ground.	0
ClaimBuster	17745	And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.	0
ClaimBuster	17746	And when it comes to public ethics, he has a responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	17747	Now he's having to say that again.	1
ClaimBuster	17748	And the problem, John, with the strategy that's been pursued was that, for 10 years, we coddled Musharraf, we alienated the Pakistani population, because we were anti-democratic.	1
ClaimBuster	17749	I wasn't just getting more power and more power.	0
ClaimBuster	17750	And that allows us also to rebuild alliances and make friends around the world to combat future threats.	0
ClaimBuster	17751	So I am still focussed on gridlock, I guess.	0
ClaimBuster	17752	But we're so, turned so inward we don't understand the global picture.	0
ClaimBuster	17753	That's what we've been doing over the last eight years and that has actually made us more safe.	1
ClaimBuster	17754	There is not a simple answer.	0
ClaimBuster	17755	There is a difference between big federal government and somebody who is coming from outside of Washington who will trust individuals.	0
ClaimBuster	17756	We need to have more second chance programs.	0
ClaimBuster	17757	I've heard them explain - try to explain - how they tell their children how they can go into a store and buy a loaf of bread but then can't go into that store and sit at the counter and get a Coca Cola.	1
ClaimBuster	17758	We shot, what, 44 cruise missiles, worth about a million-two a piece, and hit some radar, that repaired in a couple, three days.	1
ClaimBuster	17759	We do so in my state of Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	17760	Now, you didn't hear any plan from the president, because he doesn't have a plan to lower the cost of health care.	1
ClaimBuster	17761	We need to move in a new direction.	0
ClaimBuster	17762	I will get us on track to a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	17763	And then as a last resort only, continue to use atomic power.	0
ClaimBuster	17764	50 million Americans get no tax relief under his plan.	1
ClaimBuster	17765	Five million people have lost their health insurance under this president.	1
ClaimBuster	17766	But we are going to have to have some leadership from Washington that not only sets out much better regulations for the financial system.	0
ClaimBuster	17767	It's a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	17768	He has to operate in Massachusetts under a balanced budget proviso.	0
ClaimBuster	17769	Is the Middle East in tumult?	0
ClaimBuster	17770	It'd be fine with me.	0
ClaimBuster	17771	So I will have in my race more than $100 million put in -- of my money, meaning I'm not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she's doing.	1
ClaimBuster	17772	I've been working on this for a long, long time.	1
ClaimBuster	17773	"Here's what we'' -- give them a demonstration and then say -- ""Here's what we can do."	0
ClaimBuster	17774	But I can't take what is an article of faith for me and legislate it for someone who doesn't share that article of faith, whether they be agnostic, atheist, Jew, Protestant, whatever.	0
ClaimBuster	17775	The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board.	0
ClaimBuster	17776	In my judgment that statement has been distorted uh - by Mr. Nixon and others in their debates around the country and in their discussions.	0
ClaimBuster	17777	Everybody's running against the incumbent.	1
ClaimBuster	17778	My plan would dedicate $20 billion a year in each of the next 4 years for investments in new transportation, communications, environmental clean-ups and new technologies for the 21st century.	1
ClaimBuster	17779	I'm afraid I misspoke when I said a CIA head in Nicaragua.	0
ClaimBuster	17780	And we did get their attention.	0
ClaimBuster	17781	Now, there are terrorists trying to get their hands on that stuff today.	0
ClaimBuster	17782	Now, I have a plan to fix this problem and it has got to do with energy independence.	0
ClaimBuster	17783	And that's why I was so -- I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	17784	All of these things and all the promises and commitments that Senator Obama and I made (inaudible) made to you tonight will base -- will be based on whether you can trust us or not to be careful stewards of your tax dollar, to make sure America is safe and secure and prosperous, to make sure we reform the institutions of government.	0
ClaimBuster	17785	That's the difference between us.	1
ClaimBuster	17786	For 40 years, the Republican Party platforms called for guaranteeing women equal rights with a constitutional amendment.	1
ClaimBuster	17787	There's a lot of talk about trigger locks being on guns sold in the future.	1
ClaimBuster	17788	You might think that with that kind of concern that Senator Obama would have gone to Afghanistan, particularly given his responsibilities as a subcommittee chairman.	0
ClaimBuster	17789	And everyone of them -- the boys' club leaders, the ministers -- all of them were saying pass enterprise zones.	0
ClaimBuster	17790	I want to make sure the public school system in America keeps its promise so not one child is left behind.	0
ClaimBuster	17791	And what kind of small business do you have?	0
ClaimBuster	17792	The middle-income families in America have been crushed over the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	17793	That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.	0
ClaimBuster	17794	Let's remember the way to win is not to retreat and not to surrender.	0
ClaimBuster	17795	And so, in our seven years, we find that we have been firm in our diplomacy; we have never made concessions without getting concessions in return.	1
ClaimBuster	17796	But I think that we should find a way to allow some kind of civic unions, and I basically agree with Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman.	0
ClaimBuster	17797	I think I should respond to that.	0
ClaimBuster	17798	I think we can agree on that in the course of this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	17799	But in this great society of ours, wouldn't it make a lot more sense, in this gentle and kind society, if we had a program that made it possible for when incidents come along in which someone feels they must do away with that unborn child, that instead we make it available for the adoption?	0
ClaimBuster	17800	I have been accused lately of having a secret plan with regard to the hostages.	1
ClaimBuster	17801	Number one, add another million children to the insured ranks through the Medicaid program.	0
ClaimBuster	17802	We're going into the next century a better America.	0
ClaimBuster	17803	But what we've done is use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the United States to preserve the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	17804	I favor higher salaries for teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	17805	And -- and we're going to have to recognize that we have to do as the president has done.	0
ClaimBuster	17806	And -- and we've got to deal with cost.	0
ClaimBuster	17807	But the only way you can express your love for clean water is to double the appropriations for clean water, and then rant against the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	17808	And what I've also said is for young people who come here, brought here often times by their parents.	0
ClaimBuster	17809	And, Mr. President, just yesterday the Duelfer report told you and the whole world they worked.	1
ClaimBuster	17810	I can talk to people, as my wife Teresa does, about making other choices, and about abstinence, and about all these other things that we ought to do as a responsible society.	0
ClaimBuster	17811	She's been talking about it for years.	1
ClaimBuster	17812	And you're going to stop them?	0
ClaimBuster	17813	It encouraged them to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	17814	And it did and we will win this one and we won't come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail.	0
ClaimBuster	17815	You know what it is?	0
ClaimBuster	17816	And that's why I've proposed what I think is a fair and a responsible proposal that helps protect these people who've already got no relief or actually got a tax increase.	0
ClaimBuster	17817	So, my heritage as a Southerner, my experience in the Oval Office, convinces me that what I have just described is a proper course for the future.	1
ClaimBuster	17818	I never dreamed that some day I would win that nomination and be my party's nominee for president.	0
ClaimBuster	17819	I had the honor of visiting with Prime Minister Allawi.	1
ClaimBuster	17820	Margaret, Kitty and I had very much the same kind of experience that the Bushes had: we lost a baby, lived about twenty minutes after it was born.	1
ClaimBuster	17821	We have to move ahead in order to stay ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	17822	... have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief.	1
ClaimBuster	17823	There's been no change in my attitude at all.	1
ClaimBuster	17824	If the money does not come in there to pay for these programs, we will cut other government spending or we will slow down the phase-in of the programs.	0
ClaimBuster	17825	Why didn't you change it when you were a senator?	0
ClaimBuster	17826	I'll look at it at the time.	0
ClaimBuster	17827	Well what you're seeing in this country is 23 million people struggling to find a job.	1
ClaimBuster	17828	I'm going to keep my word to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	17829	I'm against removing dams in the northwest.	0
ClaimBuster	17830	One of those ideas was to repeal the minimum wage, and several times this year, Governor Reagan has said that the major cause of unemployment is the minimum wage.	1
ClaimBuster	17831	More progress in the past eight years than in the whole eighty years before.	1
ClaimBuster	17832	I think the business community wants to get involved.	0
ClaimBuster	17833	I thought that was the subject we were supposed to be on.	0
ClaimBuster	17834	He said it was in the public interest at the time and most everybody who was involved in it, I guess, thought it was.	1
ClaimBuster	17835	Only 95 percent of them -- 95 percent come in today uninspected.	1
ClaimBuster	17836	Because you'd be in jail.	0
ClaimBuster	17837	And so when I sit down with the Secretary of the Navy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we determine how are we going to be best able to meet all of our defense needs in a way that also keeps faith with our troops, that also makes sure that our veterans have the kind of support that they need when they come home.	1
ClaimBuster	17838	As far as a summit conference is concerned, I want to make my position absolutely clear.	0
ClaimBuster	17839	This is the biggest kiss that's been given to -- to New York banks I've ever seen.	0
ClaimBuster	17840	Certainly the President of the United States, the highest office in the world, the most important office in the world, has a responsibility to young people, as we talked about earlier.	0
ClaimBuster	17841	That answer almost made me want to scowl.	0
ClaimBuster	17842	And that means that the local law enforcement officials need help at the federal level.	0
ClaimBuster	17843	I mean, Senator McCain has been talking tough about earmarks, and that's good, but earmarks account for about $18 billion of our budget.	1
ClaimBuster	17844	But on the other hand, he has a responsibility to be accurate.	0
ClaimBuster	17845	I find that just absolutely...	0
ClaimBuster	17846	Now let's move a million people from welfare to work.	0
ClaimBuster	17847	But, unfortunately, a lot of schools are trapping children in schools that just won't teach and won't change.	0
ClaimBuster	17848	And, like Franklin Roosevelt, I don't care whether an idea is a Republican idea or a Democrat idea.	0
ClaimBuster	17849	Because the Congress failed to act, I am going to announce tomorrow that the Department of Commerce will disclose those companies that have uh - participated in the Arab boycott.	0
ClaimBuster	17850	I think they're better off, all of us are, that we got the interest rates down and the deficit down.	1
ClaimBuster	17851	But what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me.	0
ClaimBuster	17852	I think that this is a kind of a hypocritical policy when, at the same time, we're maintaining a detente with the one nation in the world where there are no human rights at all - the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	17853	We've got agreements, but they are still there.	0
ClaimBuster	17854	Well, you talk about walking a waffle line -- he says he's allowed it, which means he's going to allow the destruction of life up to a certain amount and then he isn't going to allow it.	0
ClaimBuster	17855	The president takes credit for all these people off welfare.	0
ClaimBuster	17856	We are back on the right track.	0
ClaimBuster	17857	The program that the president -- two-thirds of the budget, I as president never get to look at, never get to touch.	0
ClaimBuster	17858	That was done with much thought and deliberation.	0
ClaimBuster	17859	Mr. President, you're batting 0 for 2.	0
ClaimBuster	17860	In adesh- in addition, uh - uh - as a result of my pressure an the Congress, we got a major mass transit program uh - over a four-year period, eleven billion eight-hundred million dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	17861	It means a lot to a lot of people watching us tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	17862	I met with the Black Congressional Caucus at the White House.	1
ClaimBuster	17863	Well, I think -- let's talk about taxes, because I think it's instructive.	0
ClaimBuster	17864	I just want to make this point, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	17865	It's now the largest peacetime government ever in terms of the take from the total economy.	1
ClaimBuster	17866	We just see the world in different ways.	0
ClaimBuster	17867	And how to get them passed?	0
ClaimBuster	17868	I think you'll see more minority candidates and women candidates coming forward.	0
ClaimBuster	17869	Under my plan the man gets immediate help with prescription drugs.	1
ClaimBuster	17870	Children whose parents wouldn't speak English as a first language just move through.	0
ClaimBuster	17871	And at this point, it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six-party -- or the six-point cease-fire.	0
ClaimBuster	17872	My opponent talks about fiscal sanity.	1
ClaimBuster	17873	A president's job is to win the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	17874	And that's why proliferation is one of the centerpieces of a multi-prong strategy to make the country safer.	0
ClaimBuster	17875	Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	17876	That's not the way to end unemployment or to reduce unemployment.	0
ClaimBuster	17877	The fact is I've picked somebody who not only will be a great Vice President, but if, God forbid, something happens to the president, could step into that office and do so with distinction and with strength and with leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	17878	I hope they talked and I hope they've reached some result and that the killing will end.	0
ClaimBuster	17879	We believe in tough love.	0
ClaimBuster	17880	But I can tell you this.	0
ClaimBuster	17881	She's cut the size of government.	1
ClaimBuster	17882	Third, what's really hurting American business more than anything else is the cost of health care.	0
ClaimBuster	17883	We can make a huge difference by saying if you receive federal money we expect you to show results.	0
ClaimBuster	17884	And I hope that he'll be out of office very shortly.	0
ClaimBuster	17885	And so what we did was take away those leases.	0
ClaimBuster	17886	What Mr. Gore's plan will do causing huge payroll taxes or major benefit reductions.	0
ClaimBuster	17887	Yes, I have stated in both uh - debates and state again that I believe in a balanced budget and have supported that concept during my fourteen years in the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	17888	Till they're destroyed, some crazy person can either sell them or use them.	0
ClaimBuster	17889	If you confiscate the Forbes 400 wealth, take it all, you cannot balance the budget this year.	1
ClaimBuster	17890	I cast my lot with the people even when it means that you have to stand up to some powerful interests who are trying to turn the -- the policies and the laws to their advantage.	0
ClaimBuster	17891	A lot of good people have lost jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	17892	If you give me four years more I will work on it some more and I will try to answer these charges, but I prefer to emphasize direct answers to the future and I gave you a direct answer.	0
ClaimBuster	17893	I think this is very harmful at a time Mr. Khrushchev is here - harmful because it's wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	17894	This election is about big things.	0
ClaimBuster	17895	Now, if you study our international competitors, some of our international competitors collect up to $3.50 a gallon in taxes, and they use that money to build infrastructure and to create jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	17896	This is one of the most emotional and difficult issues that could possibly be debated.	0
ClaimBuster	17897	Well, there he goes again, that line has been used before, I mean, exaggerating all the things that he did.	0
ClaimBuster	17898	So we need more protection from America.	0
ClaimBuster	17899	We uh - now encourage people to waste electricity, and uh - by giving uh - the lowest rates to the biggest users.	1
ClaimBuster	17900	We - quite often we have a transient problem.	0
ClaimBuster	17901	I understand what it's like to send young American's in harm's way.	0
ClaimBuster	17902	After 9/11, after the recession had ended, the president asked for another tax cut and promised 5.6 million jobs would be created.	1
ClaimBuster	17903	But we did something else that was interesting.	0
ClaimBuster	17904	Senator Obama was the second highest recipient of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac money in history -- in history.	1
ClaimBuster	17905	... but -- but -- but overall.	0
ClaimBuster	17906	In terms of Darfur, I agree it's genocide.	0
ClaimBuster	17907	... before the invasion, he supported it.	1
ClaimBuster	17908	We've lost 357,000 manufacturing jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	17909	So I welcome that challenge, and just watch --	0
ClaimBuster	17910	That's my vision for public education all around America.	0
ClaimBuster	17911	And I think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, Senator McCain, says more about your campaign than it says about me.	1
ClaimBuster	17912	And he is supporting me 100 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	17913	But, Peter, please understand, the liberals do not like me talking about liberal They don't like it when I say that he says he's a card carrying member.	0
ClaimBuster	17914	And maybe part of that problem is because during the 4 years of the Carter-Mondale administration medical costs in this country went up 87 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	17915	When I make a mistake I'll admit it.	0
ClaimBuster	17916	Social Security is not that tough.	0
ClaimBuster	17917	But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	17918	The woman who bought the guns for the two boys who did that killing at Columbine said that if she had had to give her name and fill out a form there, she would not have bought those guns.	1
ClaimBuster	17919	Traditionally, if you've been involved in a campaign like that, you know that the parents with kids in school are the ones that turn out and vote.	0
ClaimBuster	17920	We've got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	17921	And so I'll just be asking for support to get that put into effect.	0
ClaimBuster	17922	Ten thousand out of 12,000 Humvees aren't armored.	1
ClaimBuster	17923	And that was rejected, and that's why I voted present, because I'm willing to support a ban on late-term abortions as long as we have that exception.	1
ClaimBuster	17924	I have never answered the question, however; second, the one that says, well, tell me, what are some of those ideas?	0
ClaimBuster	17925	But I have a difference with this president.	0
ClaimBuster	17926	Look, we're in an information age.	0
ClaimBuster	17927	There was a momentary fear that he might win and that the markets went phwee, down like that.	0
ClaimBuster	17928	And number three, we need to help and support Russia and the republics in every possible way to become democratic capitalistic societies, and not just sit back and let those countries continue in turmoil.	0
ClaimBuster	17929	My five-point plan does it.	0
ClaimBuster	17930	I don't; I believe in free and fair trade, and that's the thing that saved us.	0
ClaimBuster	17931	I'd like to be the next president of the United States to support and help this great nation and to make sure that we all together remain America as the hope of the earth.	0
ClaimBuster	17932	My opponent voted against the ban.	1
ClaimBuster	17933	Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case...	0
ClaimBuster	17934	I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia?	0
ClaimBuster	17935	Now, this comes from an answer that I've made at least 50 times during this campaign to the press, when I am asked have you any ideas of what you would do if you were there?	0
ClaimBuster	17936	First you've got to have money to pay for these things.	0
ClaimBuster	17937	This is how Donald thinks.	0
ClaimBuster	17938	And just remember this, folks.	0
ClaimBuster	17939	They've had a chance to form consensus.	0
ClaimBuster	17940	As president I have to be sure that those waivers, which we're approving all over the place, are covered under the law.	1
ClaimBuster	17941	We're going to pull the country together.	0
ClaimBuster	17942	We have to be -- we have to know what we're doing.	0
ClaimBuster	17943	I'm very familiar with it.	0
ClaimBuster	17944	Let's get back to Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	17945	But among those you named, I won't actively work for the passage of any of them.	0
ClaimBuster	17946	And I really believe that it - it's far better for us and for the Soviet Union, and more importantly for the people around the world, that these two superpowers find an answer for a SALT II agreement before October three, 1977.	0
ClaimBuster	17947	You talked about it last time, you talked about a risky scheme and Vice President Gore repeated it about ten times in St. Petersburg.	1
ClaimBuster	17948	If the president were to be reelected you're going to see a $716 billion cut to Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	17949	We've gotten away fro values and the fundamentals.	0
ClaimBuster	17950	And that's why I've proposed a $4,000 tuition credit, every student, every year, in exchange for some form of community service, whether it's military service, whether it's Peace Corps, whether it's working in a community.	1
ClaimBuster	17951	I thought the president made the right decision in joining NATO and bombing Serbia.	0
ClaimBuster	17952	I think also that the American people want a balanced program that gives us long-term growth so that they're not having to take money that's desperate to themselves and their families and give it to someone else.	0
ClaimBuster	17953	And the United States needs help from other countries.	0
ClaimBuster	17954	No, I can see why people think that he changes position quite often, because he does.	1
ClaimBuster	17955	I'm glad you thought I was a standard bearer four years ago, but I wasn't.	1
ClaimBuster	17956	And he was right then, and we still are the last best hope of man on earth.	0
ClaimBuster	17957	I want to have tax relief for all people who pay the bills in America, because I think you can spend your money more wisely than the federal government can.	0
ClaimBuster	17958	I understand exactly what the Soviets are up to, but that, too, is a part of national strength.	0
ClaimBuster	17959	Mr. Stone, I have submitted an economic plan that I have worked out in concert with a number of fine economists in this country, all of whom approve it, and believe that over a five year projection, this plan can permit the extra spending for needed refurbishing of our defensive posture, that it can provide for a balanced budget by 1983 if not earlier, and that we can afford - along with the cuts that I have proposed in Government.	0
ClaimBuster	17960	I was especially moved in Richmond a few days ago when 209 of our fellow citizens got to ask us questions.	1
ClaimBuster	17961	And I made a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	17962	And I will not -- I will not under any circumstances, reduce the share that's being paid by the highest income taxpayers.	0
ClaimBuster	17963	It is a question of which administration does the right thing.	0
ClaimBuster	17964	All of these, and especially homeland security, which we'll talk about a little bit later.	0
ClaimBuster	17965	If I'm entrusted with the presidency, here are the choices that I will make.	0
ClaimBuster	17966	Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	17967	I want people to hear what he just said.	0
ClaimBuster	17968	They'll have at least two plans.	1
ClaimBuster	17969	I have no illusions about the Soviet Union leadership or the nature of that state.	0
ClaimBuster	17970	... because it's an important part of the American experience.	0
ClaimBuster	17971	And we are not equal in this treaty for one reason alone - our B-2 bombers are considered to be strategic weapons; their Backfire bombers are not.	0
ClaimBuster	17972	They're moving very rapidly because they know that it is a fast-growing world market.	0
ClaimBuster	17973	My administration worked with the Congress to create the Department of Homeland Security so we could better coordinate our borders and ports.	1
ClaimBuster	17974	Because they could go back worse than things used to be.	0
ClaimBuster	17975	We have taken the initiative, and in southern Africa today the United States is trusted by the black front-line nations and black Africa.	1
ClaimBuster	17976	Again, I'd say if they asked us to play some reasonable role, I don't know how I would respond.	0
ClaimBuster	17977	I'm planning on (inaudible) to grow.	0
ClaimBuster	17978	I believe that we ought to keep guns out of the hands of people that shouldn't have them.	0
ClaimBuster	17979	And, you know, look, I understand that Donald's been strongly supported by the NRA.	1
ClaimBuster	17980	We don't have to live like this.	0
ClaimBuster	17981	We've created five million jobs, and gone from 800 jobs a month being lost, and we are making progress.	1
ClaimBuster	17982	Until we get the surpluses off the farmer's back, however, we should have a program such as I announced, which will see that farm income holds up.	0
ClaimBuster	17983	We can lift our schools up.	0
ClaimBuster	17984	We can't dictate the terms of peace, which means that you have to be steady.	0
ClaimBuster	17985	We'd have won what Bill Clinton won.	0
ClaimBuster	17986	My plan is Social Security plus.	0
ClaimBuster	17987	Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything.	0
ClaimBuster	17988	And these aren't just representatives of the United States, they are my representatives.	0
ClaimBuster	17989	But it's important to have credibility and credibility is formed by being strong with your friends and resolute in your determination.	0
ClaimBuster	17990	Secondly, my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance.	0
ClaimBuster	17991	John, it's been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending.	1
ClaimBuster	17992	Just today, policemen was shot, two killed.	1
ClaimBuster	17993	We should make sure our legal system works.	0
ClaimBuster	17994	I hope to get a sense of should I be fortunate to be the president how my administration will react to the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	17995	She said, I can't be here until 7 or 8 o'clock at night.	1
ClaimBuster	17996	Now, whether it is rightful, on a single issue, for anyone to advocate that someone should not be elected or not, I won't take a position on that.	0
ClaimBuster	17997	So, in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said, let's help to finance the Transcontinental Railroad, let's start the National Academy of Sciences, let's start land grant colleges, because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all Americans, because if all Americans are getting opportunity, we're all going to be better off.	1
ClaimBuster	17998	So, you talk about friend?	0
ClaimBuster	17999	I see Syria with 30,000 civilians dead, Assad still in power.	1
ClaimBuster	18000	We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare.	0
ClaimBuster	18001	He been a senator for 20 years.	1
ClaimBuster	18002	It's an agenda that says we're going to reform Medicare to make sure seniors have got prescription drugs and to give seniors different options from which they can choose.	1
ClaimBuster	18003	And I think it's important to know that that was a process that was necessary to get those companies back on their feet, so they could start hiring more people.	0
ClaimBuster	18004	It's to make sure that everybody pays taxes on the income that they earn and make sure that you take whatever savings there is from the higher income levels and give it to the lower- and middle-income families.	0
ClaimBuster	18005	And you could never quite get the job done.	0
ClaimBuster	18006	And I'm a big fan of NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	18007	If it's incest, how do you draw moral judgments on that?	0
ClaimBuster	18008	I think it cannot work, won't work, and will lead to all kinds of cynical evasions of the law.	0
ClaimBuster	18009	But there are a lot of procedures that haven't kept up in Medicare with the current times.	1
ClaimBuster	18010	But that's what the election's about.	0
ClaimBuster	18011	We have people that want to fight both at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	18012	It is a great tribute to our founders that 224 years later this nation is now looked to by the peoples on every other continent and the peoples from every part of this earth as a kind of model for what their future could be.	1
ClaimBuster	18013	Result: $139 billion windfall profit to the drug companies coming out of your pockets.	1
ClaimBuster	18014	And they're going to end up getting nuclear.	0
ClaimBuster	18015	You can't do that and expect to win the war on terror.	0
ClaimBuster	18016	They have a VAT tax.	1
ClaimBuster	18017	And when we find a problem, we spend extra money to correct it.	0
ClaimBuster	18018	Now, we've got to address one of the biggest threats to our democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	18019	That's why we're going to have to go out into the housing market and we're going to have to buy up these bad loans and we're going to have to stabilize home values, and that way, Americans, like Alan, can realize the American dream and stay in their home.	0
ClaimBuster	18020	I don't have any criticism of Mr. Perot.	0
ClaimBuster	18021	Let's take advantage of the energy resources we have, as well as the energy sources for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	18022	That's why I think it's important for the United States, for instance, not to have this rigid ideological restriction on helping families around the world to be able to make a smart decision about family planning.	0
ClaimBuster	18023	These programs have been cut and slashed and butchered, and they've hurt kids all over this country.	1
ClaimBuster	18024	Just to finish briefly, I started to say that for the last eight years I've been on the National Security Council.	1
ClaimBuster	18025	Look, we need the highest possible ethical standards.	0
ClaimBuster	18026	And I want to thank the University of Denver.	0
ClaimBuster	18027	And we want to pursue that plan in a way which will bring down the level of nuclear armament, will build a more stable and more peaceful world while making choices here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	18028	Let's not, let's help, let's turn the schools back to the teachers and back to the parents and take it away from the National Education Association.	0
ClaimBuster	18029	I think there are still lot of problems in Bosnia.	0
ClaimBuster	18030	Secondly, we all committed ourselves, as have all my predecessors in the Oval Office not to permit the spread of nuclear weapons to a terrorist nation, or to any other nation that does not presently have those weapons or capabilities for explosives.	0
ClaimBuster	18031	And we're still losing a lot of auto jobs, in my judgment, because we don't have a national economic strategy that will build the industrial base of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	18032	Those are the people -- these are the greatest negotiators in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	18033	Will we ever be safe and secure again?	0
ClaimBuster	18034	Senator McCain is right that we've got to stabilize housing prices.	0
ClaimBuster	18035	They now have a plan to cover everybody and their premiums are two-thirds of the rest of the country.	1
ClaimBuster	18036	And we're making progress there.	1
ClaimBuster	18037	But our real power comes, I think, from our values.	0
ClaimBuster	18038	Those pre-conditions would apply that we wouldn't legitimize with a face to face meeting, a person like Ahmadinejad.	0
ClaimBuster	18039	And -- and I just -- so I just have to make this general point that the Bush administration, some of Senator McCain's own advisers all think this is important, and Senator McCain appears resistant.	0
ClaimBuster	18040	But because Tommy Franks did such a great job in planning the operations, we moved rapidly, and a lot of the Baathists and Saddam loyalists laid down their arms and disappeared.	1
ClaimBuster	18041	I signed a bill called the Unborn Victims of Violence Act.	1
ClaimBuster	18042	But we now have an economy that, for the first time -- well, let's put it this way: In the first half of 1980, gross national product was down a minus 3.7 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	18043	Well, let me just respond with regard to Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	18044	I think the governor is blurring housing and the homeless.	0
ClaimBuster	18045	Our expenditures for defense, our expenditures for mutual security, our expenditures for economic assistance and technical assistance are not going to get less.	0
ClaimBuster	18046	That's what I intend to do.	0
ClaimBuster	18047	But all the committees, the attorney general, the special prosecutor, all of them have given me a clean bill of health.	1
ClaimBuster	18048	And the thing I find is if I make a mistake, I admit it.	0
ClaimBuster	18049	I don't want anybody to stampede to cut the president's salary off altogether.	0
ClaimBuster	18050	That's how we built the world's greatest middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	18051	So it is a priority for me.	0
ClaimBuster	18052	And this is what's caused the great migration, where she's taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases -- not probably, who are definitely...	1
ClaimBuster	18053	And now, in the position I hold and in the world in which we live, where Embassies do get blown up in Beirut -- we're supposed to talk about that on the debate the 21st, I understand -- but I pose a threat to several hundred people if I go to church.	1
ClaimBuster	18054	They're the best, the best ever at it.	0
ClaimBuster	18055	My reading of the threat from Iran is that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, it is an existential threat to the State of Israel and it is a threat to other countries in the region because the other countries in the region will feel compelling requirement to acquire nuclear weapons as well.	0
ClaimBuster	18056	They asked him, please repair the tension -- Democrat senators -- please repair the tension...	1
ClaimBuster	18057	That's really part of your mistrust here.	0
ClaimBuster	18058	So let's stop talking about cutting Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	18059	My friend, Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, is pushing a law to make sure that Arab-Americans are treated with respect.	1
ClaimBuster	18060	I disagree with Senator McCain in how to do it, because the way Senator McCain has designed his plan, it could be a giveaway to banks if we're buying full price for mortgages that now are worth a lot less.	1
ClaimBuster	18061	"We sit down with Ahmadinejad, and he says, ""We're going to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth,"" and we say, ""No, you're not""?"	1
ClaimBuster	18062	Well, I thank you for that question, because there's no doubt that history shows us that nations that are strong militarily over time have to have a strong economy, as well.	0
ClaimBuster	18063	We don't have to settle for 23 million people struggling to find a good job.	1
ClaimBuster	18064	But I do say a majority are.	1
ClaimBuster	18065	I support the farm bill, the 1985 farm bill and spending is moving in the right direction.	0
ClaimBuster	18066	One thing I would like to say is I agree with what Senator Dole said.	0
ClaimBuster	18067	But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole.	0
ClaimBuster	18068	"And I'll tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, ""Senator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son's name on it."""	1
ClaimBuster	18069	Mr. Ayers, I don't care about an old washed-up terrorist.	0
ClaimBuster	18070	I have a plan -- not a secret plan.	0
ClaimBuster	18071	The budget was more grossly out of balance last year than ever before in the history of our country - $65 billion - primarily because our people are not at work.	1
ClaimBuster	18072	We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border.	1
ClaimBuster	18073	That is where I think the future of the world lies.	0
ClaimBuster	18074	I believe that the purpose of politics is to give people the tools to make the most of their own lives; to reinforce the values of opportunity and responsibility, and to build a sense of community so we're all working together.	0
ClaimBuster	18075	Governor Romney, you keep on trying to, you know airbrush history here.	0
ClaimBuster	18076	To repeat myself, we have this year the opportunity, which we'll realize, to produce 800 million tons of coal - an unequaled record in the history of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	18077	You guarantee they have a chance to prove they're competent.	0
ClaimBuster	18078	They want to stay free, independent perhaps of us, but certainly independent of the Communists.	0
ClaimBuster	18079	But I find more troubling than this, that on -- on the day following the assassination of the United States ambassador, the first time that's happened since 1979, when -- when we have four Americans killed there, when apparently we didn't know what happened, that the president, the day after that happened, flies to Las Vegas for a political fund-raiser, then the next day to Colorado for another event, other political event.	1
ClaimBuster	18080	I don't have a dog in this fight, but I'd like to get in on this.	0
ClaimBuster	18081	There are a lot of young workers at our rallies we go to that when they hear I'll trust them at their option to be able to manage, under certain guidelines, some of their own money to get a better rate of return so that they'll have a retirement plan in the future, they begin to nod their heads and they want a different attitude in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	18082	Under that, this year, we have seen a $21 billion reduction in the deficit from last year, based mainly on the increased revenues the Government is getting without raising tax rates.	1
ClaimBuster	18083	I wanted to give Clinton the power to use force if necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	18084	We supported a a crime bill that had 60 death penalties including, including the death penalty for drug kingpins.	1
ClaimBuster	18085	In fact, we put together a $5.6 trillion surplus in the '90s that was for the purpose of saving Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	18086	But large businesses that can afford it, we've got a choice.	0
ClaimBuster	18087	All these things take a few minutes.	0
ClaimBuster	18088	And may I say, too, that I would trust that Senator Kennedy would change his position on this - change it; because as long as he as a major presidential candidate continues to suggest that we are going to turn over these islands, he is only encouraging the aggressors - the Chinese Communist and the Soviet aggressors - to press the United States, to press us to the point where war would be inevitable.	0
ClaimBuster	18089	And I think it's very damaging to our country for Mr. Ford to have turned over this responsibility to the secretary of state.	0
ClaimBuster	18090	This is an issue that will require a new attitude.	0
ClaimBuster	18091	Let me first tell you that the best way for Iraq to be safe and secure is for Iraqi citizens to be trained to do the job.	0
ClaimBuster	18092	I'll continue, in the four years, to continue to try to work to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	18093	It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	18094	And frankly, now we're going to do it right.	0
ClaimBuster	18095	That's math that doesn't add up.	0
ClaimBuster	18096	And so call off all those pickets out there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations.	0
ClaimBuster	18097	In the meantime, I'm going to continue praying that they'll carne home.	0
ClaimBuster	18098	Early childhood education, which closes the achievement gap, so that every child is prepared for school, every dollar we invest in that, we end up getting huge benefits with improved reading scores, reduced dropout rates, reduced delinquency rates.	0
ClaimBuster	18099	I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court.	0
ClaimBuster	18100	And the way you define small businesses includes folks at the very top.	1
ClaimBuster	18101	So the point is --	0
ClaimBuster	18102	I understand how hard it is to start a small business.	0
ClaimBuster	18103	But it's not getting out because there are too few debates.	0
ClaimBuster	18104	There is an abundant supply of coal in America.	1
ClaimBuster	18105	An incredible number of young people are active in supporting my effort because they are deeply concerned that we have taken the American dream from them.	0
ClaimBuster	18106	Ross had his hand up.	1
ClaimBuster	18107	We're a serious debtor nation.	1
ClaimBuster	18108	Every time there's been an out-of-bounds remark made by a Republican, no matter where they are, I have repudiated them.	1
ClaimBuster	18109	It is because we have not grown.	0
ClaimBuster	18110	And I can prove it.	0
ClaimBuster	18111	In 1985, I was one of the first Democrats -- broke with my party.	1
ClaimBuster	18112	And secondly, it's a fundamental misunderstanding to say that the war on terror is only Osama bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	18113	But I'm not going to make any excuses.	0
ClaimBuster	18114	That they're appointed for life and that they ought to look at the Constitution as sacred.	0
ClaimBuster	18115	I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts, and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also.	0
ClaimBuster	18116	Now then, to nail it, there's one way out -- a growing, expanding job base.	0
ClaimBuster	18117	Now, the thing I love about it -- I'm just a businessman.	0
ClaimBuster	18118	Well, let me first of all talk about our diplomats, because they serve all around the world and do an incredible job in a very dangerous situation.	0
ClaimBuster	18119	Is India going to win the economic struggle or is China going to win it?	0
ClaimBuster	18120	You mentioned the Heller decision.	1
ClaimBuster	18121	But I think it's important to step back and think about what happened in Libya.	0
ClaimBuster	18122	But I'm not going to continue to throw money at a problem.	0
ClaimBuster	18123	I made a good selection.	0
ClaimBuster	18124	We have to get a handle on it.	0
ClaimBuster	18125	I refer to the fact that in 1958, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I'm very familiar with the position that the United States took in negotiating with the Chinese Communists on these two islands.	1
ClaimBuster	18126	But a president must always be willing to use troops.	0
ClaimBuster	18127	The other called it untrue.	1
ClaimBuster	18128	You know, going to a Buddhist temple and then claiming it wasn't a fundraiser isn't my view of responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	18129	I'm sure he believes just as deeply that his will move that way.	0
ClaimBuster	18130	Yes, there are big problems, and yes, people are hurting.	0
ClaimBuster	18131	Can I say just one other thing here?	0
ClaimBuster	18132	I'm going to stop other things.	0
ClaimBuster	18133	I hope we can talk more about that.	0
ClaimBuster	18134	That's why we have to balance the budget, and I will tell you how I'm going to pay for anything I promise you, line by line.	0
ClaimBuster	18135	You can't talk about it rationally.	0
ClaimBuster	18136	That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose.	1
ClaimBuster	18137	Next Tuesday is Election Day.	1
ClaimBuster	18138	I'll get Osama bin Laden, my friends.	0
ClaimBuster	18139	We have now employed eighty-eight million people in America, the largest number in the history of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	18140	We don't know whether it's going to work or not, but we keep giving the incentives.	0
ClaimBuster	18141	Now, will you sit down with us and once and for all get rid, all of us, of these nuclear weapons and free mankind from that threat?''	0
ClaimBuster	18142	We didn't guard the foreign office, where you might have found information about weapons of mass destruction.	1
ClaimBuster	18143	If you do change your behavior, then it is possible for you to re-join the community of nations.	0
ClaimBuster	18144	Ambassador Stevens -- Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help.	1
ClaimBuster	18145	Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi.	0
ClaimBuster	18146	He really didn't have a new economic program until over 1300 days into his presidency, and not all of his health care initiative has been presented to the Congress even now.	1
ClaimBuster	18147	IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m on record as saying at some point in time I hope our European friends become the peacekeepers in Bosnia and in the Balkans.	0
ClaimBuster	18148	"One vote doesn't make a difference."""	0
ClaimBuster	18149	I've heard a lot of criticism about America, and our national security policy, and all that, and much of that criticism is justified.	0
ClaimBuster	18150	We have got to unite and pull together, and there's nothing we can't do.	0
ClaimBuster	18151	I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment.	1
ClaimBuster	18152	You looked at me like my clock was up.	0
ClaimBuster	18153	It's making the country poorer, which is why I answered the gentleman the way I did before.	0
ClaimBuster	18154	I believe we can increase investment and reduce the deficit at the same time, if we not only ask the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their share; we also provide over $100 billion in tax relief, in terms of incentives for new plants, new small businesses, new technologies, new housing, and for middle class families; and we have $140 billion of spending cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	18155	It's going to grow 39 percent, and Social Security is going to grow 34 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	18156	We had civil administrators come in to set up their ways of building their towns back.	1
ClaimBuster	18157	But I am familiar with the statement, and it was made by one of the top-ranking officials of that organization.	1
ClaimBuster	18158	That's probably not going to survive you get that rate down to 25 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	18159	I mean for instance, we can now, by virtue of new technology actually get all the energy we need in North America without having to go to the -- the Arabs or the Venezuelans or anyone else.	1
ClaimBuster	18160	We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country.	0
ClaimBuster	18161	And I will not go in there and suggest changes in Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	18162	We would have had the U.N. inspectors.	0
ClaimBuster	18163	And he will do very very well.	0
ClaimBuster	18164	I advocated last May in a speech at the United Nations that we move immediately as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all nuclear devices, both weapons and peaceful devices; that we not ship any more atomic fuel to a country that refuses to comply with strict controls over the waste which can be reprocessed into explosives.	1
ClaimBuster	18165	But, you know, coming from you, who, you know, in the past has threatened extinction for North Korea and, you know, sung songs about bombing Iran, I don't know, you know, how credible that is.	1
ClaimBuster	18166	Here's what I'll do: Number one, the borders are more leaking today than they were before 9/11.	1
ClaimBuster	18167	It's called bait and switch.	0
ClaimBuster	18168	Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO.	1
ClaimBuster	18169	The Vice President and I disagree on this.	1
ClaimBuster	18170	Can they rely on us?	0
ClaimBuster	18171	Arab-Americans are racially profiled in what is called secret evidence.	1
ClaimBuster	18172	You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack, it was an act of terror.	1
ClaimBuster	18173	We need to do more and better.	0
ClaimBuster	18174	He has raised taxes several times.	1
ClaimBuster	18175	Secondly, that you get a $2,000 rebate from the government if you're a family of $30,000 or less -- it scales down as you get higher -- that you can use to purchase health care in the private markets.	1
ClaimBuster	18176	He wants to put all our eggs in one basket and give that basket to the major oil companies.	0
ClaimBuster	18177	I think you ought to get the break.	0
ClaimBuster	18178	Was there an effort to bring all the allies together around that?	0
ClaimBuster	18179	The technology is there and we have to drill now.	0
ClaimBuster	18180	And if not, I'll get rid of it.	0
ClaimBuster	18181	Health care is priority number two, because that broken health care system is bad not only for families, but it's making our businesses less competitive.	1
ClaimBuster	18182	We're not going to make those kinds of mistakes.	0
ClaimBuster	18183	That is going to be a big difference between my opponent and me.	0
ClaimBuster	18184	And we've won just about every case that we've filed, that has been decided.	0
ClaimBuster	18185	It is important because the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court.	0
ClaimBuster	18186	But we're bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	18187	Putin has outsmarted her in Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	18188	It is a decision finally that the Nationalists should make and I believe that we should consult with them and attempt to work out a plan by which the line is drawn at the island of Formosa.	0
ClaimBuster	18189	I come from the school of thought that says when people have more money in their pocket during economic times, it increases demand or investment.	0
ClaimBuster	18190	And I'm glad that the Congress moved on this drug bill and have finally called for that related to these narcotics drug kingpins.	0
ClaimBuster	18191	And so I do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said -- I'm proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran.	0
ClaimBuster	18192	Now they have to try harder if they want to keep getting federal funds.	0
ClaimBuster	18193	By the way, I went there once, and we went inside and drove in, and there was a huge poster.	1
ClaimBuster	18194	Robin, I'm going to answer your question.	0
ClaimBuster	18195	He introduced some 300 bills and he's passed five.	1
ClaimBuster	18196	And then after the Republican dirty tricks group got through with me I'm another person, which I consider an absolutely sick operation.	0
ClaimBuster	18197	I know something about prosecuting.	0
ClaimBuster	18198	Now, what can we do?	0
ClaimBuster	18199	I've had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	18200	Senator McCain's absolutely right: The D.C. school system is in terrible shape, and it has been for a very long time.	0
ClaimBuster	18201	We turn it over to the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	18202	They can take it anywhere, across state lines.	0
ClaimBuster	18203	Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	18204	His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they've ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two.	1
ClaimBuster	18205	He then wants to spend another $2 trillion on military spending that our military is not asking for.	1
ClaimBuster	18206	That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of.	1
ClaimBuster	18207	Nobody is even talking about that.	0
ClaimBuster	18208	Governor Rockefeller has been far more critical in June of our position in the world than I have been.	0
ClaimBuster	18209	We ought to say this is good.	0
ClaimBuster	18210	Look, I am a job creator, not a job destroyer.	0
ClaimBuster	18211	And uh - with that uh - in that framework would befit the - any improvements in the programs.	0
ClaimBuster	18212	To stay strong, to stay at peace, to raise high the banner of human rights, to set an example for the rest of the world, to let our deep beliefs and commitments be felt by others in other nations, is my plan for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	18213	"I think that's a good idea"" -- four years ago."	0
ClaimBuster	18214	So that's the next area I'm different than President Bush.	0
ClaimBuster	18215	But let me give you another example of a free trade agreement that Senator Obama opposes.	0
ClaimBuster	18216	And that's the economic package again.	0
ClaimBuster	18217	Their idea was to charge everybody more out-of-pocket costs in their budget that I vetoed.	1
ClaimBuster	18218	Do you know that it's tripled in the last five years?	1
ClaimBuster	18219	And I vowed something because I learned something from Vietnam.	0
ClaimBuster	18220	Until we control health care costs, we're not going to control the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	18221	We would have had sanctions.	0
ClaimBuster	18222	And why I think it is outrageous -- first of all, it isn't true.	0
ClaimBuster	18223	Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order.	0
ClaimBuster	18224	So I believe that the policies that I recommend came under the general heading of strengthening the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	18225	Now, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is he'll maintain traditional Medicare alongside it.	1
ClaimBuster	18226	This is one of the biggest challenges of our times.	0
ClaimBuster	18227	Mr. Nixon earlier indicated that he would defend Quemoy and Matsu even if the attack on these islands, two miles off the coast of China, were not part of a general attack an Formosa and the Pescadores.	1
ClaimBuster	18228	So, I think some of those charges are missing the point.	0
ClaimBuster	18229	Peace in the Middle East is in our nation's interests.	0
ClaimBuster	18230	And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes.	1
ClaimBuster	18231	So should I be fortunate enough to earn your vote, I also understand -- I want to open up markets, but I also understand that farming is a part of our national security.	0
ClaimBuster	18232	Will we use our prosperity to enrich not just the few, but all of our families?	0
ClaimBuster	18233	I've got a good relation with Vladimir.	0
ClaimBuster	18234	But I wouldn't designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check.	0
ClaimBuster	18235	We ought to make one last effort.	0
ClaimBuster	18236	And when I speak of presidential leadership, I refer for example to our attitude on the sit-in strikes.	0
ClaimBuster	18237	Because if you do, it's an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages and to blackmail us.	0
ClaimBuster	18238	I want to increase spending 14 percent, that's how simple it is.	0
ClaimBuster	18239	We cut taxes for middle-class families by about $3,600.	1
ClaimBuster	18240	If you don't agree -- leave this room with anything else tonight and if the people watching us don't leave with anything else, I hope you will leave with this.	0
ClaimBuster	18241	As a matter of fact, over 4 years, they've missed the mark by nearly $600 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	18242	We want to work with them and build a new relationship, and they with us.	0
ClaimBuster	18243	This is not because I didn't have commitment to education.	0
ClaimBuster	18244	As to what we might do, and find in further savings cuts, no, we're not going to starve the hungry.	0
ClaimBuster	18245	Saddam Hussein didn't attack us.	1
ClaimBuster	18246	The question is for the next president, are we making good judgments about how to keep America safe precisely because sending our military into battle is such an enormous step.	0
ClaimBuster	18247	And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	18248	Do you know that he voted for every increase in spending that I saw come across the floor of the United States Senate while we were working to eliminate these pork barrel earmarks?	1
ClaimBuster	18249	"At one point, while you were focused on Iraq, you said well, we can ""muddle through"" Afghanistan."	1
ClaimBuster	18250	We set up a national ceiling on health care costs tied to inflation and population growth set by health care providers, not by the government.	1
ClaimBuster	18251	And not only the training in police procedures, but human relations.	0
ClaimBuster	18252	This needs to be changed.	0
ClaimBuster	18253	A senator runs every 6 years.	1
ClaimBuster	18254	You know, my grandmother -- some of you know -- helped to raise me.	1
ClaimBuster	18255	You can't change the dynamics on the ground if you've criticized the brave leader of Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	18256	And the answer, of course, is that Communist espionage goes on all the time.	0
ClaimBuster	18257	Now he is trying to not release the votes and then go straight to a so-called runoff election without even announcing the results of the first vote.	1
ClaimBuster	18258	The voters should assume I have no litmus test on that issue or any other issue.	0
ClaimBuster	18259	That's what leadership is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	18260	Thank you, Jim, very much.	0
ClaimBuster	18261	They concluded that my plan would cover everybody and his would leave 27 million behind by the year 2000 and that my plan in the next 12 years would save $2.2 trillion in public and private money to reinvest in this economy and the average family would save $1200 a year under the plan that I offered without any erosion in the quality of health care	1
ClaimBuster	18262	I referred to the Dingle-Norwood bill.	1
ClaimBuster	18263	I don't think he was misleading when he called Iraq a grave threat in the fall of 2002.	1
ClaimBuster	18264	Mr. President, have you looked at your pension?	0
ClaimBuster	18265	But I think it's important just to remember a little bit of history.	0
ClaimBuster	18266	When I went to the United States Senate, I asked for an assignment to the Armed Services Committee.	1
ClaimBuster	18267	We have to respect one another.	0
ClaimBuster	18268	Secondly, we ought to have treatment on demand.	0
ClaimBuster	18269	You know, there's a main stream in American politics and you sit right on the far left bank.	0
ClaimBuster	18270	And I would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then.	0
ClaimBuster	18271	And I was taking on discrimination against African-American kids in schools.	1
ClaimBuster	18272	I have supported or voted for tax cuts over 600 times.	1
ClaimBuster	18273	I want to -- obviously in the egregious cases we need to enforce civil rights law, but we need to make sure that internal affairs divisions at the local level do their job and be given a chance to do their job.	0
ClaimBuster	18274	I have fought against it.	1
ClaimBuster	18275	I'll give you an example.	0
ClaimBuster	18276	They have to abide by their treaty with Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	18277	I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives.	0
ClaimBuster	18278	But the Russians, I think we can deal with them but they've got to understand that they're facing a very firm and determined United States of America that will defend our interests and that of other countries in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	18279	So you get a pretty good sense of where he's heading if he were to appoint somebody.	0
ClaimBuster	18280	And Governor Romney, our alliances have never been stronger, in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel, where we have unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation, including dealing with the Iranian threat.	1
ClaimBuster	18281	We have to have the benefits high for those that are low income, but for higher income people, we're going to have to lower some of the benefits.	0
ClaimBuster	18282	Sometimes you just have to do that because you know it's right for the country over the long run.	0
ClaimBuster	18283	And it seems to me what we need to do is to talk about not only tobacco but drugs, because drug use between 12- and 17-year-olds has doubled in this administration in the last 44 months.	1
ClaimBuster	18284	The point is -- the point is that we can fix our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	18285	And in order to have the best intelligence in the world to know who the terrorists are and where they are and what they're plotting, you've got to have the best cooperation you've ever had in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	18286	A lot of them are mentally sick.	0
ClaimBuster	18287	You know, I was in New Hampshire.	1
ClaimBuster	18288	And that makes them advantageous in the marketplace.	1
ClaimBuster	18289	The Soviet Union refused to agree to that, and we went to the summit and it was disastrous.	1
ClaimBuster	18290	When he fought regulatory reform that cost the average family 6 to $7,000 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	18291	No, this war is a matter of using every asset at our disposal to keep the American people protected.	0
ClaimBuster	18292	Now let's expand it so more people can succeed as parents and in the work force.	0
ClaimBuster	18293	Every parent I know would acquire health insurance for their children if they could.	0
ClaimBuster	18294	It's not a government plan.	1
ClaimBuster	18295	I will have an ethical office in the White House that will be under the President's personal concern.	0
ClaimBuster	18296	Kitty and I are very grateful to all of you for the warmth and the hospitality that you've given to us in your homes and communities all across this country.	0
ClaimBuster	18297	We happen to have a statute on the books that's a hate crimes statute in Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	18298	And there was a terrible reaction internationally to Mr. Bush saying he was going to give us 4 more years of trickle-down economics--another across-the- board tax cut and most of it going to the wealthy, with no real guarantee of investment.	1
ClaimBuster	18299	And I am ultimately responsible for what's taking place there because these are my folks, and I'm the one who has to greet those coffins when they come home.	0
ClaimBuster	18300	Well, there's a law pending called the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.	1
ClaimBuster	18301	I will say again: you cannot control health care costs simply by cutting Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	18302	I am not for national registration of firearms.	1
ClaimBuster	18303	But I do not believe that conservation alone is the answer to the present energy problem, because all you're doing then is staving off, by a short time, the day when you would come to the end of the energy supply.	0
ClaimBuster	18304	That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks.	1
ClaimBuster	18305	Since I did this -- this was a year ago -- all of a sudden, they're paying.	1
ClaimBuster	18306	I think you believe in them.	0
ClaimBuster	18307	We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals.	0
ClaimBuster	18308	This is -- this is an important part of the world for us.	0
ClaimBuster	18309	Of course he encourages and other people encourage contacts, and negotiations, and all other things.	0
ClaimBuster	18310	Everybody remembers that; people know what happened.	0
ClaimBuster	18311	But because of some of the mistakes that have been made -- and I give Senator McCain great credit on the torture issue, for having identified that as something that undermines our long-term security -- because of those things, we, I think, are going to have a lot of work to do in the next administration to restore that sense that America is that shining beacon on a hill.	1
ClaimBuster	18312	But we tried this before, promising people an election year tax cut that's not paid for.	1
ClaimBuster	18313	That's why he called him a grave threat.	0
ClaimBuster	18314	This is something that Senator Kennedy and all Americans must know.	0
ClaimBuster	18315	This is an administration that's had no plan.	0
ClaimBuster	18316	If you're 10 we'll put you here, 12 you put here.	1
ClaimBuster	18317	We can build a new modern electric grid.	0
ClaimBuster	18318	The point is, the big winner is going to be Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	18319	I don't have any experience in gridlock government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else.	0
ClaimBuster	18320	The question is what we're going to do in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	18321	So now I want to hire another 100,000 new math and science teachers, and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now.	0
ClaimBuster	18322	Twenty-three million Americans still struggling to find a good job.	1
ClaimBuster	18323	The constitutional amendment for voluntary prayer in school, in my view would be a great idea.	0
ClaimBuster	18324	They're using cheap hand guns.	1
ClaimBuster	18325	I wrote the anti-terrorist report for this government.	1
ClaimBuster	18326	I think they stand for civil rights.	0
ClaimBuster	18327	I believe very much in our renewable capabilities; ethanol, wind, solar will be an important part of our energy mix.	0
ClaimBuster	18328	I would love to respond.	0
ClaimBuster	18329	Surplus is money -- more money than needed.	0
ClaimBuster	18330	Secondly, I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers' salaries.	0
ClaimBuster	18331	We gave them $150 billion back.	1
ClaimBuster	18332	They're in the civilian labor market and they're not fighting anywhere around the world today.	1
ClaimBuster	18333	When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach.	0
ClaimBuster	18334	We've got to start also holding people accountable, and we've got to reward people who succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	18335	And hopefully in the next segment you could lay that to rest.	0
ClaimBuster	18336	We don't know what's going to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	18337	Why don't you give back the money?	0
ClaimBuster	18338	Never wanted to commit troops.	0
ClaimBuster	18339	And it also says that you're going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care.	1
ClaimBuster	18340	But do not erode out of the system the thousand points of light.	0
ClaimBuster	18341	Who does he owe money to?	0
ClaimBuster	18342	Part of the Arizona law said that law enforcement officers could stop folks because they suspected maybe they looked like they might be undocumented workers and check their papers.	1
ClaimBuster	18343	I sometimes think he's like the witch doctor that gets mad when a good doctor comes along with a cure that'll work.	0
ClaimBuster	18344	But they come to me and they say, please get the Congress to stop passing so many mandates telling us how to control things.	0
ClaimBuster	18345	We got away, we got into this feeling that value- free education was the thing.	0
ClaimBuster	18346	As a matter of fact, I'm the first governor in the history of my state to fund that pension system, and I'm very proud of that.	1
ClaimBuster	18347	I think this election has to be geared toward the future.	0
ClaimBuster	18348	So now there are five voices speaking to Kim Jong Il, not just one.	1
ClaimBuster	18349	This president and his administration have told you and all of us it's not a question of when, it's a question of -- excuse me -- not a question of if, it's a question of when.	0
ClaimBuster	18350	Now, the facts are we have to fix it.	0
ClaimBuster	18351	And with inspiration and hard work we can achieve great things.	0
ClaimBuster	18352	We need a strong economic package; we need a tax cut; we need the $500 child credit, and we'll have that soon.	0
ClaimBuster	18353	And therefore, that was the reason that I would not uh - identify any particular course of action uh - when I responded to a question a week or so ago.	0
ClaimBuster	18354	He should be held accountable.	0
ClaimBuster	18355	His words amount to genocide incitation.	0
ClaimBuster	18356	Secretary Clinton has done an extraordinary job.	0
ClaimBuster	18357	But that's not the question.	0
ClaimBuster	18358	But also, I think it is safe to say that we do have sources of energy that have not yet been used or found.	1
ClaimBuster	18359	She talks about solar panels.	1
ClaimBuster	18360	I get the last word (inaudible) I hope.	0
ClaimBuster	18361	If we negotiate from a position where the power balance or wave is moving away from us, it's extremely difficult to reach a successful decision on Berlin as well as the other questions.	0
ClaimBuster	18362	And if you imagine just one company trying to deal with that, now imagine a million companies all across the country.	0
ClaimBuster	18363	I want to make sure the education system fulfills its hope and promise.	0
ClaimBuster	18364	And we need a measure -- and I will support a measure -- that brings about those objectives but avoids that one aspect that I think is very serious.	0
ClaimBuster	18365	The death penalty is a very serious business, Leo.	0
ClaimBuster	18366	One of the things I've done in Texas is I've been able to put together a good team of people.	1
ClaimBuster	18367	But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn't there, but possibly she's consulted.	0
ClaimBuster	18368	Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence?	0
ClaimBuster	18369	This -- this is a critical opportunity for America.	0
ClaimBuster	18370	... just a quick follow-up on this.	0
ClaimBuster	18371	Like Kyoto Treaty would have done.	0
ClaimBuster	18372	And so we have to understand that we can't just surrender and lose jobs year in and year out.	0
ClaimBuster	18373	We're going to build alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	18374	You know, I could talk for the rest of the debate -- I know I don't have the time to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	18375	So how much did you cut (inaudible)?	0
ClaimBuster	18376	We've got to help Russia succeed in its revolution and all of its republics.	0
ClaimBuster	18377	We can also have a- an end to the extremes.	0
ClaimBuster	18378	Here we are with a government that's been dealing with a drug-running Panamanian dictator.	1
ClaimBuster	18379	I want to do -- I don't like this idea of these boards.	0
ClaimBuster	18380	The president has never said whether or not he would do that.	1
ClaimBuster	18381	And I think they looked and thought, well, that's an unusual honor to receive from the President of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	18382	That's why I put out a five-point plan that gets America 12 million new jobs in four years and rising take-home pay.	1
ClaimBuster	18383	When we went out to south central in Los Angeles -- some of you may remember the riots there.	0
ClaimBuster	18384	But as well, we need to continue to pursue adult stem-cell research.	0
ClaimBuster	18385	We also have to have in mind something else with regard to this whole situation in the world, and that is: that as America moves forward, we not only must think in terms of fighting Communism, but we must also think primarily in terms of the interests of these countries.	0
ClaimBuster	18386	My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have.	0
ClaimBuster	18387	Can you run through the list again?	0
ClaimBuster	18388	First, he says he's for medical liability reform, particularly for OB/GYNs.	1
ClaimBuster	18389	It will require bigger cuts in Medicare than I vetoed last time.	1
ClaimBuster	18390	Now I'm back to square one.	0
ClaimBuster	18391	We seem to come full circle again.	0
ClaimBuster	18392	And so I am not going to furlough men like Willie Horton, and I would meet with their, the victims of his last escapade, the rape and the brutalization of the family down there in Maryland.	0
ClaimBuster	18393	I have supported character education programs in our schools, drug-free schools programs.	1
ClaimBuster	18394	Jim, let's -- we've gone on a lot of topics there, and so it's going to take a minute to go from Medicaid to schools...	0
ClaimBuster	18395	So some of it is unfair.	0
ClaimBuster	18396	Bear in mind also, Milosevic has been indicted as a war criminal and he should be held accountable for his actions.	1
ClaimBuster	18397	We are moving forward with negotiations and, you see, I just think it would be dumb negotiating policy with the Soviets to cut out one or the other of the two options right now.	0
ClaimBuster	18398	We need to increase pressure time, and time again on Iran because anything other than a -- a -- a solution to this, which says -- which stops this -- this nuclear folly of theirs, is unacceptable to America.	0
ClaimBuster	18399	And today, there are four to seven nuclear weapons in the hands of North Korea.	1
ClaimBuster	18400	And with all of the money they have, we're defending them, and they're not paying?	0
ClaimBuster	18401	The Vice President suggested a number of things.	1
ClaimBuster	18402	"I think John McCain called the energy bill the ""No Lobbyist Left Behind"" bill."	1
ClaimBuster	18403	No, let -- let -- let me go back and speak to the points that the president made and -- and -- and let's get them correct.	0
ClaimBuster	18404	But they're basically American, I believe in them.	0
ClaimBuster	18405	I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	18406	And it means that we can have tough, vigorous debates around issues.	0
ClaimBuster	18407	This will give them a chance to choose their own futures, not have Senator Obama and government decide that for them.	0
ClaimBuster	18408	"Some say, ""well, you're a little old fashioned."""	0
ClaimBuster	18409	We have to make it possible.	0
ClaimBuster	18410	She's a reformer through and through.	0
ClaimBuster	18411	Then you have to look at our proposals for our economy, not $860 billion in new spending, but for the kinds of reforms that keep people in their jobs, get middle-income Americans working again, and getting our economy moving again.	0
ClaimBuster	18412	And we can do so in a way that marshals our forces, that provides real support for state and local law enforcement officers who have not been getting that support, and do it in a way which will bring down violence in this nation, will help our youngsters to stay away from drugs, will stop this avalanche of drugs that's pouring into the country, and will make it possible for our kids and our families to grow up in safe and secure and decent neighborhoods.	0
ClaimBuster	18413	We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost.	1
ClaimBuster	18414	There's a sense of American occupation.	0
ClaimBuster	18415	Now give me 1 second...	0
ClaimBuster	18416	You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids.	0
ClaimBuster	18417	And this is the reason why, working with Israel, we have created the strongest military and intelligence cooperation between our two countries in history.	1
ClaimBuster	18418	I think that is something we have to take seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	18419	It means having intelligent decisions that keep our prosperity going and shepherds that economic strength so that we can provide that leadership role.	0
ClaimBuster	18420	I thought we were talking about immigration.	0
ClaimBuster	18421	You go upstate New York.	0
ClaimBuster	18422	And if you care about the future of America, if you care about your future, just don't do it.	0
ClaimBuster	18423	I'm going to do those things, because that's what's right in America: Help workers to transition in every respect.	0
ClaimBuster	18424	I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.	1
ClaimBuster	18425	And when we are strong and when we are first, then freedom gains; then the prospects for peace increase; then the prospects for our society gain.	0
ClaimBuster	18426	We've changed for the first time since FDR -- since FDR we had the -- we've always had the strategy of saying we could fight in two conflicts at once.	1
ClaimBuster	18427	The president and I share the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman.	1
ClaimBuster	18428	It's an honor to be here with you, and I appreciate the chance to be with the president.	0
ClaimBuster	18429	Incredibly, incredibly Senator Obama didn't go to Iraq for 900 days and never asked for a meeting with General Petraeus.	1
ClaimBuster	18430	We've got to deal with this problem, and those of us who want to be your President should tell you now what we're going to do, so you can make a judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	18431	I'll get incomes up again.	0
ClaimBuster	18432	I'm not for gay marriage.	0
ClaimBuster	18433	But here's the point he misses.	0
ClaimBuster	18434	And they told me they could not have performed their duty, the duty we all expect of them, if they did not have the ability to communicate with each other under the Patriot Act.	1
ClaimBuster	18435	We feel that you can hold the line and restrain federal spending, give a tax reduction and still have a balanced budget by 1978.	0
ClaimBuster	18436	But he never apologizes for anything to anyone.	0
ClaimBuster	18437	Gonna have to take a look at all the managed care going on in California, or we're going to end up losing our best care that we have in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	18438	The Social Security system was based on a false premise, with regard to how fast the number of workers would increase and how fast the number of retirees would increase.	1
ClaimBuster	18439	I think somebody who doesn't want me to be president might have run that ad.	0
ClaimBuster	18440	Now, you can come back in and you can become a citizen.	0
ClaimBuster	18441	I appoint people of independence and integrity and intelligence, people who will be a credit to the Bench.	0
ClaimBuster	18442	You don't like the answer, but it's an answer.	0
ClaimBuster	18443	The new economic revitalization program that we have in mind, which will be implemented next year, would result in tax credits which would let business invest in new tools and new factories to create even more new jobs - about one million in the next two years.	0
ClaimBuster	18444	We all remember Pearl Harbor.	0
ClaimBuster	18445	That's a lot of marijuana.	0
ClaimBuster	18446	We've seen progress over the past several years.	1
ClaimBuster	18447	Social Security is totally funded by the payroll tax levied on employer and employee.	1
ClaimBuster	18448	"The president stood right here in this hall four years ago, and he was asked a question by somebody just like you, ""Under what circumstances would you send people to war?"""	1
ClaimBuster	18449	DISC, you said, was about 1.4 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	18450	And they're over there, not over here.	1
ClaimBuster	18451	But this can't keep on going.	0
ClaimBuster	18452	This is just 1 of 1000.	1
ClaimBuster	18453	I hate to interrupt you, but at some point...	0
ClaimBuster	18454	We're going to balance the budget, by the year 2002.	0
ClaimBuster	18455	This is primarily an ideological battle - a battle for the minds and the hearts and the souls of men.	0
ClaimBuster	18456	I would like to, of course, and I presume this administration would as well.	0
ClaimBuster	18457	I say that the American people don't want to go back to those policies.	0
ClaimBuster	18458	Office estimate that there is probably tens of billions of dollars that is lost in fraud alone, and they have added that waste adds even more to that.	1
ClaimBuster	18459	The ideas I express are mine.	0
ClaimBuster	18460	Second reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for it.	1
ClaimBuster	18461	We certainly must maintain an engagement there.	0
ClaimBuster	18462	It's a fundamental difference between what we believe.	0
ClaimBuster	18463	I'm tired of being told we can't.	0
ClaimBuster	18464	Whether or not one makes decisions based on sound principles or whether or not you rely upon polls and focus groups on how to decide what the course of action is.	0
ClaimBuster	18465	And these are things I think that will go a long way toward helping America build a stronger economy and a better tax system.	0
ClaimBuster	18466	Well, the resurgence of Russia is one of the central issues that we're going to have to deal with in the next presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	18467	I wouldn't want to be a liberal either, Mr. President, but you're stuck with it because that's your record, that's your record in Arkansas: The biggest tax increase in history.	1
ClaimBuster	18468	First of all, I don't see how it's possible for a one-third of a body, such as the Republicans have in the House and the Senate to stop two-thirds, if the two-thirds are adequately led.	0
ClaimBuster	18469	They feel that the levels we're operating at and the reductions that I have proposed are proper.	0
ClaimBuster	18470	He won't support freeing local districts from the strings of federal money.	0
ClaimBuster	18471	I'm totally focussed on the fact that we may have bank failures and nobody answered it.	0
ClaimBuster	18472	It's a time for unity.	0
ClaimBuster	18473	That's not where we are today.	0
ClaimBuster	18474	Mr. President, I'm glad to be here with you again to share similarities and differences with the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	18475	And I think most people know my position on the sanctity of life.	0
ClaimBuster	18476	But the important thing is what are we going to do now?	0
ClaimBuster	18477	"And the ""Los Angeles Times"" spent a lot of ink going into that."	0
ClaimBuster	18478	But it's the Internal Revenue Service which estimates now that we aren't collecting $100 billion or more in taxes owed in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	18479	But when we find children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach, instead of saying oh, this is okay in America just to shuffle poor kids through schools, there has to be a consequence.	0
ClaimBuster	18480	And for the 5 years previous to our taking office, taxes doubled in the United States, and the budgets increased $318 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	18481	Africa is now the emerging area of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	18482	And it's all a question of what our priorities are.	0
ClaimBuster	18483	The reason you didn't is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do.	0
ClaimBuster	18484	Miss Quinn, I would be very happy to accept the challenge of your question tonight, to tell the voters of this country exactly what I think it's going to cost, because I believe that all too often in past elections, politicians have simply been promising people things that they cannot deliver.	0
ClaimBuster	18485	And the president of South Korea went back to South Korea bewildered and embarrassed because it went against his policy.	0
ClaimBuster	18486	Tom, wave like that and I'll look at you.	0
ClaimBuster	18487	So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.	0
ClaimBuster	18488	And I just told you the facts, sir.	1
ClaimBuster	18489	But at the time that uh - I submitted the Sinai agreement to the Congress of the United States, I submitted every single document that was applicable to the Sinai II agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	18490	But we can do them all at once.	0
ClaimBuster	18491	Well, I don't mind paying a little more.	0
ClaimBuster	18492	I mean, the president received a letter from 38 Democrat senators saying the tensions with Israel were a real problem.	1
ClaimBuster	18493	I wish America had that kind of record and I think most people looking at us tonight would like it if we had more jobs and a lower spending burden on the government.	0
ClaimBuster	18494	And you'll find a tort reform plan.	0
ClaimBuster	18495	No, I think you'll see --	0
ClaimBuster	18496	It's a fundamental difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	18497	I don't rule out modernization, and there are discussions going on now in the Congress, I know with the Pentagon, about a less expensive modernized land-based leg of the triad.	0
ClaimBuster	18498	We agreed in principle on an insurance agreement, and we're working on three or four other areas now, but the way you have to do it is make sure you're competitive.	1
ClaimBuster	18499	What will determine whether Senator Kennedy or I, if I am elected, was a great president?	0
ClaimBuster	18500	Japan is trying to get the commercial airline business.	1
ClaimBuster	18501	But, when I had quoted a Democratic President, as the President says, I was a Democrat.	1
ClaimBuster	18502	And until we do, Americans here at home are not going to be safe.	0
ClaimBuster	18503	I can think of many.	0
ClaimBuster	18504	Actually, we've increased funding for dealing with nuclear proliferation about 35 percent since I've been the president.	1
ClaimBuster	18505	But I'm not going to telegraph my punches, which is what Senator Obama did.	1
ClaimBuster	18506	"People say, ""I don't care."	0
ClaimBuster	18507	First of all, the report to which Senator Kennedy refers is one that was made many, many months ago and related particularly to the uh - period immediately after Sputnik.	1
ClaimBuster	18508	And I might say that two-thirds of the Republicans in the House voted against a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage and a majority of the Democrats sustained it - nearly two-thirds of them voted for the dollar twenty-five.	1
ClaimBuster	18509	Nobody has that except a president who has served a long time or a secretary of state.	1
ClaimBuster	18510	As a matter of fact, the year before I went out of office we gave a $50 million refund to the property taxpayers of Georgia.	1
ClaimBuster	18511	Because this ever-rising arms race madness makes both nations less secure.	0
ClaimBuster	18512	It may later be Catholics; it may be - later be Baptists who are threatened by some foreign country.	0
ClaimBuster	18513	There are many of the points that he has made that I would like to comment upon.	0
ClaimBuster	18514	If you don't have health insurance, you're going to be able to buy the same kind of insurance that Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees.	1
ClaimBuster	18515	Well, you're right about Islamophobia, and that's a shame.	0
ClaimBuster	18516	It is 300,000 people smaller today than it was eight years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	18517	And I don't want to give my friend Ross another shot at me here but I am fighting with the Congress to get this through.	0
ClaimBuster	18518	And of course he's going to raise your taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	18519	And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years.	1
ClaimBuster	18520	But let me just tell you.	0
ClaimBuster	18521	And I've done what no candidate for President has ever done, I told you before the election what I'd do.	1
ClaimBuster	18522	"They said, ""Well, these are the people that have the qualifications."""	0
ClaimBuster	18523	Now, we've made it clear, along with our allies, that when Milosevic leaves, then Serbia will be able to have a more normal relationship with the rest of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	18524	First of all on the issue of partial birth or so-called late-term abortion, I would sign a law banning that procedure, provided that doctors have the ability to save a woman's life or to act if her health is severely at risk.	0
ClaimBuster	18525	I'm going to lead the world in the greatest counterproliferation effort.	0
ClaimBuster	18526	That's the argument between Mr. Nixon and myself and on that issue the American people have to make their judgment and I think it's a important judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	18527	Now, that -- put you in jail in corporate America if you kept books that way but in government it's just kind of the way things are.	0
ClaimBuster	18528	And while I'm all for the McKinney bill, that, by itself, simply won't do.	0
ClaimBuster	18529	I think sometimes Mr. Mondale's running away from his.	0
ClaimBuster	18530	That is the number-one threat we face in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	18531	The NAFTA agreement is defective.	0
ClaimBuster	18532	For the last ten years the budget of the United States has grown from uh - about 11 percent per year.	1
ClaimBuster	18533	The reorganization proposal that I have put forward is one uh first step.	1
ClaimBuster	18534	Together we can get anything done.	0
ClaimBuster	18535	He insulted a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, called her an eating machine.	1
ClaimBuster	18536	This is what it's all about.	0
ClaimBuster	18537	There are plenty of people standing in line to become a citizen.	1
ClaimBuster	18538	So, if we're at a point in history where we want to stop talking about it and do it, I've got a lot of experience in figuring out how to solve problems, making the solutions work, and then moving on to the next one.	0
ClaimBuster	18539	They lost plenty of money on that one.	1
ClaimBuster	18540	This has a great effect on the s- underdeveloped world, which faces problems of low income and high population density and inadequate resources.	1
ClaimBuster	18541	First of all, by the way, I'd eliminate ethanol subsidies.	0
ClaimBuster	18542	It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	18543	But what we haven't yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	18544	Since this campaign began I have had a very rare privilege.	0
ClaimBuster	18545	But apparently his position hasn't changed.	0
ClaimBuster	18546	They must not develop nuclear capability.	0
ClaimBuster	18547	I believe in tax equity for the middle-income taxpayer, increasing the personal exemption.	0
ClaimBuster	18548	This is one instance where I agree with - with the Republican platform.	0
ClaimBuster	18549	I know I can do a better job in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	18550	The Wall Street Journal said 96 percent of small businesses are not affected at all by my plan.	1
ClaimBuster	18551	And Senator Obama says he's for nuclear, but he's against reprocessing and he's against storing.	1
ClaimBuster	18552	Of course, I listen to our generals.	0
ClaimBuster	18553	We have to do a better job in human intelligence.	0
ClaimBuster	18554	But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund...	0
ClaimBuster	18555	We didn't have two and a half million, or three million homeless people living on streets and in doorways in this country ten years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	18556	My plan has five basic parts.	0
ClaimBuster	18557	The second biggest surplus next to Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	18558	In a country as wealthy as ours, for us to have people who are going bankrupt because they can't pay their medical bills -- for my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies because they're saying that this may be a pre-existing condition and they don't have to pay her treatment, there's something fundamentally wrong about that.	1
ClaimBuster	18559	But I think Governor Romney maybe hasn't spent enough time looking at how our military works.	0
ClaimBuster	18560	Whether it's organized labor or whether it's the Hollywood elite or whether some of the media elite or whether it's the labor unions or whatever.	0
ClaimBuster	18561	I believe that the world is changing fast.	0
ClaimBuster	18562	What service are you in?	0
ClaimBuster	18563	I believe the best way to help our small businesses is not only through small-business loans, which we have increased since I've been the president of the United States, but to unbundle government contracts so people have a chance to be able to bid and receive a contract to help get their business going.	1
ClaimBuster	18564	What really matters is what happens to your future and what happens to our country as we stand on the brink of a new century, a time of extraordinary possibility.	0
ClaimBuster	18565	It's got to be fair.	0
ClaimBuster	18566	They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs - a few large companies in many cases - and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place.	0
ClaimBuster	18567	It's precisely what Kim Jong Il wants.	0
ClaimBuster	18568	Now, with respect to DOMA and the marriage laws, the states have always been able to manage those laws.	1
ClaimBuster	18569	We're getting rid of carried interest provisions.	1
ClaimBuster	18570	I'll be against it when I'm president.	0
ClaimBuster	18571	Yes, that's a great question.	0
ClaimBuster	18572	And you know what, the issue is changing.	0
ClaimBuster	18573	It would depend entirely on what they asked us to do, but the real secret there is for them to abide by the agreements they've made and find a way to trust each other, and they're going to have to spend some time and trust each other.	0
ClaimBuster	18574	We've got ten and a half million more jobs, the deficit's been reduced by 60 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	18575	I feel strongly about education.	0
ClaimBuster	18576	I couldn't agree more that the Iraqis want to be free and that they could be free.	0
ClaimBuster	18577	By the time the century turns, we have got to have our deficit under control, we have to work out of so that surplus is building up so when the baby boomers like me retire, we're okay.	0
ClaimBuster	18578	It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives.	1
ClaimBuster	18579	He was right, but then he put in place deficits twice that size for every one of his four years.	1
ClaimBuster	18580	Why shouldn't you get what you want, as opposed to what some lobbyist cuts a deal, writes a little piece in the law and he goes through.	0
ClaimBuster	18581	I doubt that I acknowledged that this year.	0
ClaimBuster	18582	Americans shouldn't have gone there in the first place, had we let them defend themselves, as they have a right to do under Article 57 of the United Nations charter.	1
ClaimBuster	18583	America needs a new direction.	0
ClaimBuster	18584	I think one of the problems we have, particularly for seniors, is there is no prescription drug coverage in Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	18585	He points to the fact that I visited Cuba while Mr. Batista was in power there.	1
ClaimBuster	18586	We're at a fork in the road.	0
ClaimBuster	18587	Let me just quickly say, at the current pace, the president will not secure the loose material in the Soviet Union -- former Soviet Union for 13 years.	0
ClaimBuster	18588	If you itemize your tax return, you get no marriage penalty relief.	1
ClaimBuster	18589	Well, I hope this is the first and last time I have to say this.	0
ClaimBuster	18590	But I think it's worth it, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	18591	So the General Motors experience is relevant.	0
ClaimBuster	18592	We've got young people who have got the grades and the will and the drive to go to college, but they just don't have the money.	0
ClaimBuster	18593	Our diversity is a strength.	0
ClaimBuster	18594	Well, you know, I admire so much Senator Obama's eloquence.	0
ClaimBuster	18595	He caused the death of so many people.	1
ClaimBuster	18596	Senator Obama has never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue.	1
ClaimBuster	18597	It's a time to draw ourselves together: to have a president and a Congress that can work together with mutual respect for a change, cooperating for a change, in the open for a change, so the people can understand their own government.	0
ClaimBuster	18598	But it's in your hands.	0
ClaimBuster	18599	"And they all say, ""Well, it was a long time ago."""	0
ClaimBuster	18600	And I'll tell you exactly why.	0
ClaimBuster	18601	When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful.	1
ClaimBuster	18602	At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides.	0
ClaimBuster	18603	And I would make sure that the uh - Saudis understood this ahead of time so there would be no doubt in their mind.	0
ClaimBuster	18604	We have much more manpower and much more equipment there.	1
ClaimBuster	18605	And as a result, these mainly Hispanic youngsters are some of the best learners in Houston, Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	18606	His whole body was shaking from the nerve disease, the muscular disease that he had.	1
ClaimBuster	18607	I am for the North American Free Trade Agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	18608	That's where he was when he came into office.	1
ClaimBuster	18609	And we can't do it unless we do have adequate funds for, for example, information which has been cut by the Congress, adequate funds for technical assistance.	0
ClaimBuster	18610	We know where you're cutting right now.	0
ClaimBuster	18611	How much did you cut them by?	0
ClaimBuster	18612	Now on the question of gold.	0
ClaimBuster	18613	The President shouldn't have vetoed that bill.	0
ClaimBuster	18614	The force must be strong enough so that the mission can be accomplished.	0
ClaimBuster	18615	Well, I think the answer uh - as to the kind of person that I would select uh - is obvious.	0
ClaimBuster	18616	But between us, we can either destroy the world or we can save it.	0
ClaimBuster	18617	I have disagreed with leaders of my own party.	1
ClaimBuster	18618	Well, if you've got a kid that's extravagant, you can lecture him all you want to about his extravagance.	0
ClaimBuster	18619	You shouldn't be worrying if you get a new job as to whether that's gonna -- and part of our plan is to make it what they call portable -- big word, but that means if you're working for the Jones Company and you go to the Smith Company, your insurance goes with you.	0
ClaimBuster	18620	You know, after we killed bin Laden I was at ground zero for a memorial and talked to a young women who was four years old when 9/11 happened.	1
ClaimBuster	18621	We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.	0
ClaimBuster	18622	I would uh - also like to point out that we, in this country, have let our economy go down the drain.	0
ClaimBuster	18623	We set a very high standard for ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	18624	And I cannot let that stand, because it isn't true.	0
ClaimBuster	18625	And, frankly, you should have changed the laws.	0
ClaimBuster	18626	Now, on the Middle East, as you know, I worked very hard for peace in the Middle East.	1
ClaimBuster	18627	I would have fought to make certain our troops had everybody possible to help them win the mission.	0
ClaimBuster	18628	And in addition, the tax program of the Ford administration, which provides an incentive for industry to move into our major uh - metropolitan areas, into the inner cities, will bring jobs where people are, and help to revitalize those cities as they can be.	1
ClaimBuster	18629	We spoke a multitude of tongues.	1
ClaimBuster	18630	Well, Tom, we're going to have to take on entitlements and I think we've got to do it quickly.	0
ClaimBuster	18631	I was very disappointed in the fact that the uh - GAO released that report because I think it interjected political partisan politics at the present time.	0
ClaimBuster	18632	If in the next 5 minutes a television announcer came on and said, there is a major international crisis -- there is a major threat to the world or in this country a major threat -- my question is, who, if you were appointed to name 1 of the 3 of us, who would you choose?	0
ClaimBuster	18633	And they will make those sacrifices.	0
ClaimBuster	18634	And it makes a difference in terms of how well and effectively women are able to work.	0
ClaimBuster	18635	I think in education, when he lectured the country about the importance of discipline, I didn't like it at first, but I think it helped a little bit.	0
ClaimBuster	18636	I will fight for oil, coal and natural gas.	0
ClaimBuster	18637	Well, let me say I do think that parties are important in that they tell something about the program and something about the man.	0
ClaimBuster	18638	And I left the party eventually, because I could no longer follow the turn in the Democratic leadership that took us down an entirely different path, a path of centralizing authority in the Federal Government, lacking trust in the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	18639	Small businesses begin to grow, and jobs are added.	0
ClaimBuster	18640	And I'm glad that Governor Romney agrees with the steps that we're taking.	1
ClaimBuster	18641	And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth.	0
ClaimBuster	18642	"In our particular church, we did not use that term, ""born again,'' so I don't know whether I would fit that -- that particular term."	1
ClaimBuster	18643	We were losing 800,000 jobs a month when I started.	1
ClaimBuster	18644	Number three, we do have to make sure that we're protecting religious minorities and women because these countries can't develop unless all the population, not just half of it, is developing.	0
ClaimBuster	18645	Number three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	18646	I just figure, as lucky as I've been, I owe it to them and I owe it to the future generations and on a very personal basis, I owe it to my children and grandchildren.	0
ClaimBuster	18647	If I thought that there was no alternative, then I might feel differently.	0
ClaimBuster	18648	"Let me -- I'm not exactly sure what you mean, ""passes the global test,"" you take preemptive action if you pass a global test."	0
ClaimBuster	18649	We have to be tough on the Soviet Union, but I think the American people -- --	0
ClaimBuster	18650	And the answer is, yes, we can help, but it's going to take a different path.	0
ClaimBuster	18651	And you say: Well, how are you going to pay for it?	0
ClaimBuster	18652	That old adage they use--we're going to soak the rich- -we're going to soak the rich--it always ends up being the poor cab driver or the working man that ends up paying the bill.	0
ClaimBuster	18653	That's an incredibly powerful nuclear deterrent.	0
ClaimBuster	18654	It means that we are helping state and local governments set up road projects and bridge projects that keep people in their jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	18655	And so, today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the cost: $200 billion -- $200 billion that could have been used for health care, for schools, for construction, for prescription drugs for seniors, and it's in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	18656	We have never been asked to send troops to the West Bank.	1
ClaimBuster	18657	We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz.	1
ClaimBuster	18658	The United Nations, Kofi Annan offered help after Baghdad fell.	1
ClaimBuster	18659	If I could wish for one thing for great public schools, it would be a strong family unit in every home -- nothing will ever replace that.	0
ClaimBuster	18660	And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.	0
ClaimBuster	18661	And one of the things I think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in America.	0
ClaimBuster	18662	I'd rather, if you gave me 2 bad choices --	0
ClaimBuster	18663	We're going to have to-the MX.	0
ClaimBuster	18664	There has been a restoration of faith and confidence and trust in the presidency because I've been open, candid and forthright.	0
ClaimBuster	18665	We don't have good health care.	0
ClaimBuster	18666	You will know their names.	0
ClaimBuster	18667	I supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts; John McCain opposed it.	1
ClaimBuster	18668	I was just at a coal facility, where some 1,200 people lost their jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	18669	It must be in the national interests, must be in our vital interests whether we ever send troops.	0
ClaimBuster	18670	I've talked to bankers and builders and developers, the housing advocates, community development agencies, and they want leadership from Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	18671	We've been battling over abortion for a long period of time.	1
ClaimBuster	18672	And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated.	1
ClaimBuster	18673	We must associate ourselves with their aspirations.	0
ClaimBuster	18674	We're the best producers in the world, and I want -- I want the farmers feeding the world.	0
ClaimBuster	18675	That's what America is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	18676	There are no guarantees that uh - if you take uh - one road or another that you will be a successful president.	0
ClaimBuster	18677	Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience.	0
ClaimBuster	18678	What I want to emphasize, though, is that I have been a strong proponent of pay-as- you-go.	1
ClaimBuster	18679	They've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	18680	America is a fair society, and it is not right that Vice President Bush pays less in taxes than the janitor who helps him.	1
ClaimBuster	18681	Then I believe that we should move full time on our missile production, particularly on Minuteman and on Polaris.	0
ClaimBuster	18682	Well, think about what the governor -- think about what the governor just said.	0
ClaimBuster	18683	I'm a pretty independent thinker.	0
ClaimBuster	18684	We'll have what economists call middle-out growth.	0
ClaimBuster	18685	There will be no more debates.	1
ClaimBuster	18686	Now in the special session of Congress and also in the session that preceded it, the Democratic Congress - in which there's a two-to-one Democratic majority - was asked by the President to give us the funds and give us the power to do a job and they did nothing at all, And in the special session in which Senator Kennedy was calling the signals, along with Senator Johnson, they turned it down and he himself voted against giving us the powers despite the fact that the bill had already been considered before, that it already had hearings on, and the Congress already knew what it had before it.	1
ClaimBuster	18687	Well, just for the record, when I was governor we had the lowest -- second lowest tax burden of any state in the country, the highest job growth rate of any state when I ran for president and were widely recognized for a lot of other advances.	1
ClaimBuster	18688	That's why my proposal protects everybody from $25,000 a year or less against any tax increases, and treats those $70,000 and under in a way that is more beneficial than the way the President proposes with a sales tax or a flat tax.	0
ClaimBuster	18689	I did not advocate reducing the federal debt because I don't believe that you're going to be able to reduce the federal debt very much in nineteen sixty-one, two, or three.	1
ClaimBuster	18690	I've said that years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	18691	It seems to me that if we're going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close.	0
ClaimBuster	18692	That's why we have to emphasize manufacturing.	0
ClaimBuster	18693	I've watched year in and year out as companies have shut down and people have lost their jobs because China has not played by the same rules, in part by holding down artificially the value of their currency.	1
ClaimBuster	18694	I'm for that proposed law, the governor is against it.	1
ClaimBuster	18695	That's what I thought we ought to do.	0
ClaimBuster	18696	We didn't think that was right.	0
ClaimBuster	18697	And I'm not going to stand for somebody saying that because someone yelled something at a rally -- there's a lot of things that have been yelled at your rallies, Senator Obama, that I'm not happy about either.	0
ClaimBuster	18698	The islands which Mr. Nixon is discussing are five or four miles, respectively, off the coast of China.	1
ClaimBuster	18699	How about a spending freeze on everything but defense, veteran affairs and entitlement programs.	0
ClaimBuster	18700	When uh - the Nixon-Ford Administration started, this was 10 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	18701	But I don't believe this president can.	0
ClaimBuster	18702	I think a lot of people deserve credit and I've tried to give it to them.	0
ClaimBuster	18703	This is not the end of the process; this is the beginning of the process.	0
ClaimBuster	18704	But I'm not in favor of rounding up people and -- and -- and taking them out of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	18705	Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years.	1
ClaimBuster	18706	Number two, let's help families right away by providing them a tax cut -- a middle-class tax cut for people making less than $200,000, and let's allow them to access their IRA accounts without penalty if they're experiencing a crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	18707	But the fact of it is, every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit has been off by billions and billions of dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	18708	But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City.	1
ClaimBuster	18709	I hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president.	0
ClaimBuster	18710	So the appropriate thing strategically to do was to reduce his ability to threaten his neighbors.	0
ClaimBuster	18711	I happen to -- I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit.	0
ClaimBuster	18712	The federal government has cut Medicare and Medicaid in the last few years, states have cut Medicaid -- we've done it in Arkansas under budget pressures.	1
ClaimBuster	18713	In the last debate, my opponent said those lawsuits only caused the cost to go up by 1 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	18714	I don't think you can -- I don't think you can get results that way.	0
ClaimBuster	18715	He jumped on it a year after it had been introduced and it never got passed.	1
ClaimBuster	18716	One of the things we've done is we've taken the -- we're beginning to transform our military.	1
ClaimBuster	18717	And finally, moving generic drugs to the market quicker.	0
ClaimBuster	18718	And we hope that we'll be serving you in the White House in January of 1989.	0
ClaimBuster	18719	I've got to make this point, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	18720	Fourth, let me say that in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the great force on our side is the desire of people to be free.	0
ClaimBuster	18721	So my belief is that, (A), we have to enforce the laws we've already got, make sure that we're keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, those who are mentally ill. We've done a much better job in terms of background checks, but we've got more to do when it comes to enforcement.	0
ClaimBuster	18722	And I think when you make a mistake, you say I made a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	18723	Teddy Roosevelt used to talk about the arena, you know, daring to fail greatly or succeed, no matter.	1
ClaimBuster	18724	I see my friend Senator Mitchell.	0
ClaimBuster	18725	Instead, it's gone up by that amount.	1
ClaimBuster	18726	And what I have proposed is something much better.	0
ClaimBuster	18727	But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate.	1
ClaimBuster	18728	Now our challenge is to take these things, do something with them.	0
ClaimBuster	18729	The budget that we are talking about is not reducing our military spending.	1
ClaimBuster	18730	And it's a big problem.	0
ClaimBuster	18731	And I'd say to the Reform party, take a look at the Republican party.	0
ClaimBuster	18732	We've got a very good record appointing women to high positions and positions of trust, and I'm not defensive at all about it.	1
ClaimBuster	18733	And guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap?	0
ClaimBuster	18734	What's wrong with limiting the terms of members of Congress to 12?	0
ClaimBuster	18735	Let me first give you a sports update.	0
ClaimBuster	18736	And we're going to be fiscally responsible.	0
ClaimBuster	18737	You have to make tough calls.	0
ClaimBuster	18738	And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession.	0
ClaimBuster	18739	And I can assure you that this administration will follow that high moral principle in our future efforts in foreign policy, including our efforts in the Middle East where it is vitally important because the Middle East is the crossroads of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	18740	We've got four million young people volunteering every year, the number hasn't gone down.	1
ClaimBuster	18741	And if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know we're going in, and all of the people that we really wanted -- the leaders -- they're all gone.	0
ClaimBuster	18742	So the point is, I want people to have tax cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	18743	But you have to have a little bit of experience to know where to start.	0
ClaimBuster	18744	One being Russia, where we had IMF loans that ended up in the pockets of a lot of powerful people and didn't help the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	18745	The middle-class need a rescue package.	0
ClaimBuster	18746	But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company.	1
ClaimBuster	18747	And I look forward to having that opportunity.	0
ClaimBuster	18748	Secretary, you have no plan.	0
ClaimBuster	18749	Their budget weakened our support for education.	0
ClaimBuster	18750	You can't wish it away.	0
ClaimBuster	18751	And I have to defend the honor of my state.	0
ClaimBuster	18752	And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO.	1
ClaimBuster	18753	And so, I don't think the Patriot Act abridges your rights at all.	0
ClaimBuster	18754	And then in 1982, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	18755	It's happening in other states that we visit, too.	1
ClaimBuster	18756	I agree that too many incumbent politicians in Washington in both parties have consistently opposed campaign finance reform.	0
ClaimBuster	18757	But I said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe, come and get one for free.	1
ClaimBuster	18758	Our objectives ought to be to strengthen the democracies, to stop Communist and other extremist influences, and stabilize the community in that area.	0
ClaimBuster	18759	And finally, he said he's going to have a novel health care plan.	0
ClaimBuster	18760	You rely on good military people to execute the military component of the strategy, but winning the peace is larger than just the military component.	0
ClaimBuster	18761	It would have charged seniors more for out-of-pocket costs as well as more in premiums because doctors could have charged them more.	1
ClaimBuster	18762	So I think we have to change the nature of politics.	0
ClaimBuster	18763	I care about 100 percent of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	18764	Why am I lowering taxes on the middle-class?	0
ClaimBuster	18765	So Medicare, it's going to be a little tougher.	0
ClaimBuster	18766	We can't have any more instances like what happened when Mr. Bush went to Japan and the Japanese prime minister said he felt sympathy for our country.	1
ClaimBuster	18767	And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.	0
ClaimBuster	18768	And I'll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back.	0
ClaimBuster	18769	And I made it plain to them, we're not.	0
ClaimBuster	18770	So I don't believe that we need to do what you've suggested here.	0
ClaimBuster	18771	I'm going to get the training done for our troops.	0
ClaimBuster	18772	She won't even mention the words, and neither will President Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	18773	I think that measures like these are important.	0
ClaimBuster	18774	And, frankly, Senator McCain voted for four out of five of President Bush's budgets.	1
ClaimBuster	18775	But I want to be a president of the United States who makes sure that we never again do business with a drug-running Panamanian dictator, that we never again funnel aid to the contras through convicted drug dealers.	0
ClaimBuster	18776	I saw a study that came out today that said you're going to raise taxes by $3,000 to $4,000 on middle-income families.	1
ClaimBuster	18777	I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders -- and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones -- made a difference.	1
ClaimBuster	18778	The big struggle will be to prevent the influence of Castro spreading to other countries - Mexico, Panama, Bolivia, Colombia.	0
ClaimBuster	18779	What I was saying is, we're not going to round up 12 million people, undocumented illegals, and take them out of the nation.	0
ClaimBuster	18780	We didn't listen to the nuclear freeze crowd.	0
ClaimBuster	18781	And I hope it's as soon as possible.	0
ClaimBuster	18782	That's not going to happen, so long as I'm your president.	0
ClaimBuster	18783	And now we have a major question facing the American people as to whether we'll deal with this deficit and get it down for the sake of a healthy recovery.	0
ClaimBuster	18784	Mr. Perot wants to do the same thing.	1
ClaimBuster	18785	It was clear-cut votes that Senator Obama voted, I think, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream America.	0
ClaimBuster	18786	"But we're not going to simply kill some people to say, ""Oh, look, we got even.''"	0
ClaimBuster	18787	Fourth graders and eighth graders are tested in English and math.	1
ClaimBuster	18788	Because you left out one other exception, the health of the mother.	0
ClaimBuster	18789	And we all know the state of the Washington, D.C., school system.	0
ClaimBuster	18790	Senator Kennedy has a responsibility to criticize those things that are wrong, but he has also a responsibility to be right in his criticism.	0
ClaimBuster	18791	It had a very, very big impact.	0
ClaimBuster	18792	But as we look at the quality-of-life programs - jobs, health, education, crime, recreation - we feel that as we move forward with a healthier economy, we can absorb the small necessary cost that will be required.	0
ClaimBuster	18793	Now Senator McCain and President Bush had a very different judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	18794	I was in North Pittsburgh - I think it was a few weeks ago, on my campaign - the water mains in that city had begun to leak, and literally, there wasn't money available to fix them.	1
ClaimBuster	18795	But I do think we are right when we try to, for example, give mothers and newborns 48 hours before they can be kicked out of the hospital, ending these drive-by deliveries.	0
ClaimBuster	18796	Now, Social Security, let's lay it to rest once and for all.	0
ClaimBuster	18797	...will be there for you.	0
ClaimBuster	18798	While I was Governor, more than eight years ago, I found 14 separate instances where women were discriminated against in the body of California law, and I had passed and signed into law 14 statutes that eliminated those discriminations, including the economic ones that you have just mentioned - equal pay and so forth.	1
ClaimBuster	18799	So, in some ways, we've got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for Americans and I believe that the economy works best when middle-class families are getting tax breaks so that they've got some money in their pockets, and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in, that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure we're not blowing up the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	18800	We are for programs, in addition, which will see that our medical care for the aged are - is - are much - is much better handled than it is at the present time.	0
ClaimBuster	18801	And that didn't make any sense.	0
ClaimBuster	18802	Well, first of all, I want to underscore the same point the president mad,e which is that if I'm President of the United States, when I'm President of the United States, we will stand with Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	18803	When I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women's rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	18804	For one basic reason, so that students can get more one-on-one time with teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	18805	And that's what I do.	0
ClaimBuster	18806	As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said.	0
ClaimBuster	18807	There was a story today or yesterday in the Washington Post about my economic programs and my chief budget officer and my chief economic officer were both African Americans, even though the Post didn't mention that, which I think is a sign of progress.	1
ClaimBuster	18808	And a year later, 9/11 happened.	1
ClaimBuster	18809	Let me tell you about one of the governor's.	0
ClaimBuster	18810	To negotiate with the Soviet Union a balanced, controlled, observable, and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry, there is a disturbing pattern in the attitude of Governor Reagan.	0
ClaimBuster	18811	Line item veto -- there's a good reform program for you.	0
ClaimBuster	18812	When I was a young man, my father was a senator opposed to the Vietnam War.	1
ClaimBuster	18813	If you're going to increase domestic oil and gas production - and we have to - you have to give those producers an opportunity to uh - develop their land or their wells.	0
ClaimBuster	18814	Now, it may not work.	0
ClaimBuster	18815	That's why they call the President the Commander in Chief.	1
ClaimBuster	18816	The Vice President did call Social Security a few years ago basically or largely a welfare program.	1
ClaimBuster	18817	So I can't tell you where it's coming from, but I am very much concerned about AIDS and I believe that we've got the best researchers in the world out there at NIH working the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	18818	She's raising the money from the people she wants to control.	1
ClaimBuster	18819	Can we -- can we stay on Medicare?	0
ClaimBuster	18820	The administration did not deal with it.	1
ClaimBuster	18821	You know, I support a national patient's bill of rights, Mr. Vice President, and I want all people covered.	1
ClaimBuster	18822	I'm ready to provide that leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	18823	Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there.	0
ClaimBuster	18824	That happened when I was president.	1
ClaimBuster	18825	It is also essential for us to understand what our mission is in Iran, and that is to dissuade Iran from having a nuclear weapon through peaceful and diplomatic means.	1
ClaimBuster	18826	And I'm glad that we have a good director in George Bush.	0
ClaimBuster	18827	The biggest crime increase in history, the biggest drug increase in history in Arkansas.	1
ClaimBuster	18828	And they'll have to undergo the same scrutiny that all projects should in competition with others.	0
ClaimBuster	18829	Donald Trump is a small business.	0
ClaimBuster	18830	Congress -- they're all good people.	0
ClaimBuster	18831	The only bright spot is that over 300,000 jobs have been created by small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	18832	George Bush embraced comprehensive immigration reform.	1
ClaimBuster	18833	One percent of America got more than the 80 percent of America that earned from $100,000 down.	1
ClaimBuster	18834	And that was the line.	0
ClaimBuster	18835	It's energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business.	0
ClaimBuster	18836	But I want to touch on this is tobacco thing.	0
ClaimBuster	18837	We can move forward, and clean up our climate, and develop green technologies, and alternate -- alternative energies for -- for hybrid, for hydrogen, for battery-powered cars, so that we can clean up our environment and at the same time get our economy going by creating millions of jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	18838	We didn't make a judgment in fifty-seven and fifty-six and fifty-five and fifty-four that outer space would be important.	1
ClaimBuster	18839	that is a very good reason for voting for Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen on the 8th of November.	0
ClaimBuster	18840	It's kind of Washington, D.C. focus.	0
ClaimBuster	18841	Number one, let's focus on jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	18842	It certainly looks that way.	0
ClaimBuster	18843	We're selling American automobiles in Japan now.	1
ClaimBuster	18844	My colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, will tell you that Bob Dole kept his word.	0
ClaimBuster	18845	The Joint Chiefs urged the President not to put our troops in that barracks because they were indefensible.	1
ClaimBuster	18846	Abraham Lincoln came to the presidency in 1860 after a rather little known uh - session in the House of Representatives and after being defeated for the Senate in fifty-eight and was a distinguished president.	1
ClaimBuster	18847	I can think of doctors and scientists, Jonas Salk who for example discovered a vaccine which cured one of the most dread diseases we ever had.	1
ClaimBuster	18848	And so yes, everybody's taxed too much and I want to get the taxes down, but not by signing a tax bill that's gonna raise taxes on people.	0
ClaimBuster	18849	"And I -- and I went to my staff, and I said, ""How come all the people for these jobs are -- are all men."""	1
ClaimBuster	18850	It's an issue of principle, not politics.	0
ClaimBuster	18851	Why don't I want to raise taxes on people?	0
ClaimBuster	18852	And that means doing it under the Medicare program.	0
ClaimBuster	18853	Here is the role of the federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	18854	And number three, I will not under any circumstances raise taxes on middle-income families.	0
ClaimBuster	18855	But I think it's important that we have a position, that we take it, and we state it to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	18856	I don't expect you to watch every vote.	0
ClaimBuster	18857	If they're safe, they're coming.	0
ClaimBuster	18858	I've been the governor of a big state.	1
ClaimBuster	18859	I think we can save lives.	0
ClaimBuster	18860	I'm running to get some things done for America.	0
ClaimBuster	18861	So I modified it, the largest tax increase in the history of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	18862	So part of the job of the next commander-in-chief, in keeping all of you safe, is making sure that we can see some of the 21st Century challenges and anticipate them before they happen.	0
ClaimBuster	18863	Well, Katherine, that's a great question.	0
ClaimBuster	18864	And kids across this country are going to recognize, we're bringing back an economy.	0
ClaimBuster	18865	President Obama has moved millions of people out.	1
ClaimBuster	18866	If you think the Republican party is some place for you to come if you're narrow minded or bigoted or don't like certain people in America, the exits are clearly marked for you to walk out of as I stand here without compromise, because this is the party of Lincoln.	0
ClaimBuster	18867	But -- but I can say this, that we're talking about the Middle East and how to help the Middle East reject the kind of terrorism we're seeing, and the rising tide of tumult and -- and confusion.	0
ClaimBuster	18868	If the president were reelected, we'd go to almost $20 trillion of national debt.	1
ClaimBuster	18869	That's a pocketbook issue for women and families all across the country.	0
ClaimBuster	18870	And as a consequence, we've seen millions of young people be able to afford college, and that's going to make sure that young women are going to be able to compete in that marketplace.	1
ClaimBuster	18871	And at the same time a willingness to move forward steadily, thoughtfully cautiously.	0
ClaimBuster	18872	Seventy-five percent of known Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justice.	1
ClaimBuster	18873	I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of Americans, 95 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	18874	I think we ought to have federal liability protection, depending upon whether or not standards have been met.	0
ClaimBuster	18875	I do understand creating jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	18876	Somebody somewhere has to take responsibility for this.	0
ClaimBuster	18877	Saddam Hussein released a tape, as you know, claiming it was a transcript of their meeting, where she said we will not become involved in your border dispute and, in effect, you can take the northern part of the country.	1
ClaimBuster	18878	If you entrust me with the presidency, I will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure our forces stay the strongest in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	18879	We are the strongest and most powerful free society on Earth.	0
ClaimBuster	18880	I don't think so, Candy.	0
ClaimBuster	18881	I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.	0
ClaimBuster	18882	We ended the Korean War; by strong, firm leadership we have kept out of other wars; and we have avoided surrender of principle or territory at the conference table.	1
ClaimBuster	18883	And they both looked at me and said: We need you.	1
ClaimBuster	18884	We have a deficit because this country went into a recession.	1
ClaimBuster	18885	I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise.	0
ClaimBuster	18886	The question is values; the question is strength, the question is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be provided.	0
ClaimBuster	18887	There is no doubt that we have seen in recent years - in recent months - additional acts of violence against Jews in France and, of course, against those who live in Israel, by the PLO and other terrorist organizations.	1
ClaimBuster	18888	Programs that we need, we should make them work better.	0
ClaimBuster	18889	If you're a small business person and you don't insure your employees, Senator Obama will fine you.	1
ClaimBuster	18890	Nobody talked about attacking Pakistan.	1
ClaimBuster	18891	We need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital, particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control.	0
ClaimBuster	18892	What we need to do is raise the minimum wage.	0
ClaimBuster	18893	It means that there will be increased hires.	0
ClaimBuster	18894	And it's a matter of fact that Senator Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history.	1
ClaimBuster	18895	They do some great things.	0
ClaimBuster	18896	I think that says a great deal to the American people about the standards we'll set and the quality of the people that we will pick to serve in our Administration.	0
ClaimBuster	18897	And there's been no concerted effort given to the needs of those who are both poor and black, or poor and who speak a foreign language.	0
ClaimBuster	18898	But I disagree that we don't know the cause of global warming.	0
ClaimBuster	18899	fiscal restraint, I think is necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	18900	So, yes, some may be better off.	0
ClaimBuster	18901	And as I said: You can run but you can't hide the reality.	0
ClaimBuster	18902	First of all, I think it is well to put in perspective where we really do stand with regard to the Soviet Union in this whole matter of growth.	0
ClaimBuster	18903	He can't come here and tell you that he's created health care for Americans because, what, we've got 5 million Americans who have lost their health care, 96,000 of them right here in Missouri.	1
ClaimBuster	18904	Now, here we have to decide between generalized objectives and reality.	0
ClaimBuster	18905	Now six years ago, I stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so because I said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost, what our exit strategy might be, how it would affect our relationships around the world, and whether our intelligence was sound, but also because we hadn't finished the job in Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	18906	The United States of America, Tom, is the greatest force for good, as I said.	0
ClaimBuster	18907	The most important distinction in this campaign is that I represent real hope for change, a departure from trickle-down economics, a departure from tax and spend economics, to invest in growth.	0
ClaimBuster	18908	I have fought excess spending.	1
ClaimBuster	18909	Well, that is just not accurate.	0
ClaimBuster	18910	It's time for a fresh start.	0
ClaimBuster	18911	Secretary Clinton also fought it.	1
ClaimBuster	18912	But I know putting artificial deadlines won't work.	0
ClaimBuster	18913	Yes, it's very difficult to rebut, because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr. Mondale.	0
ClaimBuster	18914	"And the budget plan that I've put out, according to the ""Los Angeles Times"" again, the way these things are typically measured as a percentage of the GDP, will bring government spending down to the lowest level in 50 years."	1
ClaimBuster	18915	"President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, ""We are great, but we can be greater.''"	1
ClaimBuster	18916	The President has asked for my advice.	1
ClaimBuster	18917	Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn't have the money to afford insurance and didn't have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.	1
ClaimBuster	18918	But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly.	1
ClaimBuster	18919	And I don't think we've got all the facts before we make decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	18920	You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history.	1
ClaimBuster	18921	But I have defined the issues and I am not going to let Governor Dukakis go through this election without explaining some of these very liberal position he's the one a liberal, traditional liberal a progressive liberal Democrat.	0
ClaimBuster	18922	Look, this isn't about Governor Bush, it's not about me.	0
ClaimBuster	18923	Let me give you an example.	0
ClaimBuster	18924	We've got $40 billion going to Bermuda.	1
ClaimBuster	18925	I think it depends how you define it.	0
ClaimBuster	18926	President Clinton opposes voluntary prayer amendment.	1
ClaimBuster	18927	Jim, I hope that we can come back to the subject of education because the governor made an extensive statement on it and I have a very different view than the one he expressed.	0
ClaimBuster	18928	I had to make the decision to destroy more life, so do we continue to destroy life -- I made the decision to balance science and ethics.	0
ClaimBuster	18929	Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy.	1
ClaimBuster	18930	This race is about values, it's about change, it's about giving choices to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	18931	That's why Zarqawi and his people are trying to fight us.	0
ClaimBuster	18932	I remember something my dad told me -- I was 18 years old going to Penn Station to go on into the Navy, and he said write your mother -- which I faithfully did; he said serve your country -- my father was an honor, duty and country man; and he said tell the truth.	1
ClaimBuster	18933	I think people need to be held responsible for the actions they take in life.	0
ClaimBuster	18934	So to add nine million new jobs, to control inflation, and to plan for the future with an energy policy now intact as a foundation is our plan for the years ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	18935	Gosh, I sure hope it's not the administration.	0
ClaimBuster	18936	Why did he fail to even promote legislation that would have provided an answer for those that want to come legally and for those that are here illegally today?	1
ClaimBuster	18937	Because there's not enough vouchers; therefore, we shouldn't do it, even though it's working.	1
ClaimBuster	18938	Mr. Ford uh - actually has fewer people now in the private sector in non-farm jobs than when he took office.	1
ClaimBuster	18939	What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.	0
ClaimBuster	18940	Back in 1983, when I was a brand-new United States congressman, the one -- the person I admired the most and still admire the most, Ronald Reagan, wanted to send Marines into Lebanon.	1
ClaimBuster	18941	African-American incomes went up 33 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	18942	He has more of the same.	0
ClaimBuster	18943	It's the age of his ideas that I question.	0
ClaimBuster	18944	And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn't put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid.	1
ClaimBuster	18945	And I don't think there's anything wrong with an honest person who happens to represent an interest of another country for making his case.	0
ClaimBuster	18946	But in late '89 the president signed a secret policy saying we were going to continue to try to improve relations with him, and we sent him some sort of communication on the eve of his invasion of Kuwait that we still wanted better relations.	1
ClaimBuster	18947	The point that is always left out is the fact that we expressed regrets to Castro this winter; that we expressed regrets - the Eisenhower Administration expressed regrets - for a flight over Southern Russia in 1958.	1
ClaimBuster	18948	In 1979 we ran a $29 billion deficit all year.	1
ClaimBuster	18949	First of all, that's simply not true what he just said, of course.	0
ClaimBuster	18950	And the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate.	1
ClaimBuster	18951	I think almost every other developed nation in the world has an energy policy except us.	1
ClaimBuster	18952	And you want to do something about all this extra spending that concerns Mr. Perot and me?	0
ClaimBuster	18953	When Senator McCain was cheerleading the president to go into Iraq, he suggested it was going to be quick and easy, we'd be greeted as liberators.	1
ClaimBuster	18954	I have fought to reform government.	1
ClaimBuster	18955	Yes, if we don't do something about it, we may find ourselves unilaterally, if I may use that term, dismantling some of these weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	18956	Well, they also know if they live in San Diego, Mr. President, if you're caught with 125 pounds of marijuana or less, you go back to Mexico.	1
ClaimBuster	18957	Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager.	1
ClaimBuster	18958	He surely must be aware that most of the equipment and arms and resources for Castro came from the United States, flowed out of Florida and other parts of the United States to Castro in the mountains.	1
ClaimBuster	18959	Now, in the meantime, the special prosecutor, within the last few days, after an investigation himself, said there was no reason for him to get involved because he found nothing that would justify it.	1
ClaimBuster	18960	Number four, get to us a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	18961	Well, you think it's relevant.	0
ClaimBuster	18962	Now that the President gets millions of dollars from the trial lawyers, he probably doesn't like this provision.	1
ClaimBuster	18963	When Governor Romney was asked whether teachers, hiring more teachers was important to growing our economy, Governor Romney said that doesn't grow our economy.	1
ClaimBuster	18964	Now, the President can say well he wants to mend it, not end it.	0
ClaimBuster	18965	I meet with them all the time.	0
ClaimBuster	18966	I will not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs.	0
ClaimBuster	18967	When I was campaigning in 1976, everywhere I went, the mayors and local officials were in despair about the rapidly deteriorating central cities of our nation.	1
ClaimBuster	18968	But if not, instead of continuing to subsidize failure, the money will go to -- the federal money will go to the parents for public school or charter school or tutorial or Catholic school.	0
ClaimBuster	18969	We have learned that you give him an inch he'll take a mile.	0
ClaimBuster	18970	No longer do we give the image of being on the rise.	0
ClaimBuster	18971	Now, finally, if you can't pay the bills you're dead in the water.	0
ClaimBuster	18972	And this administration, having been in office now for two years or more, has still not taken strong and bold action to stop the proliferation of nuclear waste around the world, particularly plutonium.	1
ClaimBuster	18973	It's hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left.	0
ClaimBuster	18974	I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint -- and I've named 20 of them -- the justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life.	0
ClaimBuster	18975	Even though we've seen some hopeful signs, perhaps, in the flash report on the third quarter, that perhaps the economy is coming out of the recession, we've also seen the rise in the rate of the prime; we have seen mortgage rates back up again, a sure sign of inflation in the housing industry.	1
ClaimBuster	18976	And the kinds of budget proposals that you've put forward, when we don't ask either you or me to pay a dime more in terms of reducing the deficit, but instead we slash support for education, that's undermining our long-term competitiveness.	0
ClaimBuster	18977	Take, for example, Third World debt.	0
ClaimBuster	18978	We then started to build up Afghan forces.	1
ClaimBuster	18979	We're on the side of justice against the forces of slavery, against the forces of injustice.	0
ClaimBuster	18980	Seven point nine percent unemployment is a terrible tragedy in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	18981	We indicated at that time that we were not going to intervene militarily.	1
ClaimBuster	18982	I will concede that in all the areas to which I have referred Senator Kennedy would have the spe- federal government spend more than I would have it spend.	0
ClaimBuster	18983	And still he talks about - uh success.	0
ClaimBuster	18984	But we've got to get through these times, but I have a fundamental belief in the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	18985	We just read on the front pages of America's papers that there are over 100,000 hours of tapes, unlistened to.	1
ClaimBuster	18986	Well, I think the answer to why the drop, I think, has been the economy in the doldrums.	0
ClaimBuster	18987	And I think what we'll plainly do is what we did in 1983 when Senator Dole served, and this is something I think he did a good job on when he served on the Social Security commission and they made some modest changes in Social Security to make sure that it would be alive and well into the 21st century.	1
ClaimBuster	18988	I don't think that's true, but you know, let others fire away on it.	0
ClaimBuster	18989	And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground.	0
ClaimBuster	18990	Also in 1975, we almost brought Israel to their knees after the uh - Yom Kippur War by the so-called reassessment of our relationship to Israel.	1
ClaimBuster	18991	This is uh - an effort that ought to be done primarily by strong leadership in the White House, the inspiration of our people, the tapping of uh - business, agriculture, industry, labor and government at all levels to work on this uh project.	0
ClaimBuster	18992	Six predecessors of mine who served in the Oval Office called for this guarantee of women's rights.	1
ClaimBuster	18993	Tom, can I respond to this briefly?	0
ClaimBuster	18994	I never, ever conceived of such a thing.	0
ClaimBuster	18995	So we've got to enforce our civil rights laws.	0
ClaimBuster	18996	So I think we can easily, within seven, eight, ten years, if we put our minds to it, we can eliminate our dependence on the places in the world that harm our national security if we don't achieve our independence.	0
ClaimBuster	18997	Although I'm not so sure I admire the record.	0
ClaimBuster	18998	I think that what -- I think the point of that is that anybody would have a hard time trying to make a tax cut plan that is so large, that would put us into such big deficits, that gives almost half the benefits to the wealthiest of the wealthy.	1
ClaimBuster	18999	The other point I wanna make is about our defense.	0
ClaimBuster	19000	You know, President Obama said the other day when you're whining before the game is even finished...	1
ClaimBuster	19001	He said he was going to broaden the base.	1
ClaimBuster	19002	I think that we have got to balance the budget every single year, pay down the national debt and, in fact, under my proposal the national debt will be completely eliminated by the year 2012.	0
ClaimBuster	19003	Are we as strong as we must be if we're going to maintain our independence, and if we're going to maintain and hold out the hand of friendship to those who look to us for assistance, to those who look to us for survival?	0
ClaimBuster	19004	We need to have full student loan program for in-state tuition.	0
ClaimBuster	19005	Well, I say they're wrong, because I'm going to create tremendous jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	19006	This is a plan that is going to increase the bureaucracy by 20,000 people.	1
ClaimBuster	19007	Now, why does that matter?	0
ClaimBuster	19008	The only building that was guarded when the troops when into Baghdad was the oil ministry.	1
ClaimBuster	19009	If we have children who are not surrounded with love and affection -- you see, I look at my grandchildren and wonder if they'll ever learn to walk because they're always in someone's arms.	0
ClaimBuster	19010	In the course of that, I think the president's campaign has tried to characterize me as -- as someone who's very different than who I am.	0
ClaimBuster	19011	And as soon as I found it out, he went out the door.	0
ClaimBuster	19012	I know I'm ready for it.	0
ClaimBuster	19013	Just -- would you like to hear...	0
ClaimBuster	19014	Not this one, however, that you bring up.	0
ClaimBuster	19015	I think that would be the greatest use of a defensive weapon.	0
ClaimBuster	19016	First of all, I take full responsibility for what happened in Somalia, but the American people must remember that those soldiers were under an American commander when that happened.	0
ClaimBuster	19017	But Kenny was a great talker.	0
ClaimBuster	19018	I would call to your attention that we were in a war that wound down during those eight years, which of course made a change in military spending because of turning from war to peace.	1
ClaimBuster	19019	And I hope people don't think that I'm questioning his patriotism when I say he used his words to describe his participation in that organization.	0
ClaimBuster	19020	That's a decision that only a woman can make, after consulting her conscience and consulting her religious principles.	0
ClaimBuster	19021	So we need to stay right on top of that and constructively help them move toward democracy and capitalism.	0
ClaimBuster	19022	If you could accept a little criticism, I went all across central Illinois and spoke about agricultural issues, about seven stops.	1
ClaimBuster	19023	That's been missing over the last eight years.	0
ClaimBuster	19024	And finally, championing small business.	0
ClaimBuster	19025	And I was surprised at the extent of it.	1
ClaimBuster	19026	I want to make sure we rebuild our military to keep the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	19027	That's a hatchet, and then I would get out a scalpel, OK?	0
ClaimBuster	19028	Under the president's policies, middle-income Americans have been buried.	0
ClaimBuster	19029	You must be tough and smart.	0
ClaimBuster	19030	Now, that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life.	0
ClaimBuster	19031	And I can tell you looking at you right now, in all cases those answers were affirmative.	0
ClaimBuster	19032	And the question is if you surrender or indicate in advance that you're not going to defend any part of the free world, and you figure that's going to satisfy them, it doesn't satisfy them.	0
ClaimBuster	19033	And I will keep that promise.	0
ClaimBuster	19034	Now, that's not a good way to build support and reduce the risk for our troops and make America safer.	0
ClaimBuster	19035	Well, first, uh - let me set the record straight.	0
ClaimBuster	19036	Well Mr. Nixon has stated the record inaccurately in regard to the depressed area bill.	1
ClaimBuster	19037	But when I started this campaign, I started it very strongly.	0
ClaimBuster	19038	Now, you've shown independence -- commendable independence, on some key issues like torture, for example, and I give you enormous credit for that.	1
ClaimBuster	19039	I stood in the South Bronx on the exact spot that President Carter stood on in 1977.	1
ClaimBuster	19040	I don't think that's a proper way to describe aayuh- chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who has fought for his country for thirty-five years, and I'm sure the governor would agree with me on that.	1
ClaimBuster	19041	In the last several years, the so-called Freedom To Farm Law has, in my view, been mostly a failure.	0
ClaimBuster	19042	Eight countries have left it.	1
ClaimBuster	19043	The record does not show that.	1
ClaimBuster	19044	Now, with respect to religion, you know, as I said, I grew up a Catholic.	1
ClaimBuster	19045	It is obvious that we should have a commitment to them, that Social Security benefits should not be taxed and that there would be no peremptory change in the standards by which Social Security payments are made to retired people.	0
ClaimBuster	19046	But when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we'll also be able to help people that can't get -- don't have money because we are going to have people protected.	0
ClaimBuster	19047	But we came through all of those things and we achieved even new heights and new greatness.	0
ClaimBuster	19048	If I could respond to that.	0
ClaimBuster	19049	And they're going to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	19050	What we can't do is go back to the same policies that got us into such difficulty in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	19051	And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion.	0
ClaimBuster	19052	He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I'd blow them out of the water and start another war.	1
ClaimBuster	19053	And so Dodd-Frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that's not qualified, there are big penalties, except they didn't ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was.	1
ClaimBuster	19054	The federal program doesn't do that.	1
ClaimBuster	19055	It will happen starting next January and maybe it can happen the balance of this year.	0
ClaimBuster	19056	And I don't want to respond in kind to all these things.	0
ClaimBuster	19057	You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have.	0
ClaimBuster	19058	Certainly I'm not proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	19059	I think this debate on Social Security, Medicare, national health insurance typifies, as vividly any other subject tonight, the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and Republican Party.	0
ClaimBuster	19060	Washington, by itself, can't do it all.	0
ClaimBuster	19061	I'm strongly in favor of a federal bill to repeal any gag rules on providers.	0
ClaimBuster	19062	I also understand that an administration is not one person, but an administration is dedicated citizens who are called by the president to serve the country, to serve a cause greater than self, and so I've thought about an administration of people who represent all America, but people who understand my compassionate and conservative philosophy.	0
ClaimBuster	19063	And from the beginning, I did vote to give the authority, because I thought Saddam Hussein was a threat, and I did accept that intelligence.	1
ClaimBuster	19064	Number two, something I would add today is I would tighten those sanctions.	0
ClaimBuster	19065	What we need is action.	0
ClaimBuster	19066	I got to watch the clock here.	0
ClaimBuster	19067	That money, I think, ought to be put into rebuilding the base of our cities.	0
ClaimBuster	19068	And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal.	1
ClaimBuster	19069	Those are the Republican chairman's words.	1
ClaimBuster	19070	And coal, coal production is not up; coal jobs are not up.	1
ClaimBuster	19071	For a return to traditions and values that we once had.	0
ClaimBuster	19072	I think the young people of America are especially interested in how they can serve, and that's one of the reasons why I'm interested in doubling the Peace Corps, making sure that we are creating a volunteer corps all across this country that can be involved in their community, involved in military service, so that military families and our troops are not the only ones bearing the burden of renewing America.	0
ClaimBuster	19073	"Will we do the things that we know must be done and know that one day, down in history 100 years or perhaps before, someone will say, ""Thank God for those people back in the 1980's for preserving our freedom, for saving for us this blessed planet called Earth, with all its grandeur and its beauty.''"	0
ClaimBuster	19074	But I'll also have a better plan of how we're going to deal with Iraq: training the Iraqi forces more rapidly, getting our allies back to the table with a fresh start, with new credibility, with a president whose judgment the rest of the world trusts.	0
ClaimBuster	19075	"That's how we repealed ""don't ask/don't tell."""	0
ClaimBuster	19076	People in the highest office of the land must be responsible for decisions they make in life.	0
ClaimBuster	19077	But most importantly, we have to have the same strategy, which Senator Obama said wouldn't work, couldn't work, still fails to admit that he was wrong about Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	19078	We did that by expanding what's called the no-fly zone by increasing our allies' control of the air space now from the Kuwait border to the suburbs of Baghdad.	1
ClaimBuster	19079	And, so, that's the way I'd reply to it and I believe we can have the strongest and best defense possible if we modernize, if we go forward with competitive strategies and if we do follow through on the Packard Commission report.	0
ClaimBuster	19080	Let me give you some specific examples.	0
ClaimBuster	19081	But the idea of a trillion dollar in cuts through sequestration and budget cuts to the military would change that.	1
ClaimBuster	19082	I don't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, while Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us.	1
ClaimBuster	19083	Mr. Bush talked about taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	19084	We have to remember that the cold war that Mr. Khrushchev is waging and his colleagues are waging, is waged all over the world and it's waged right here in the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	19085	Over the last four years we've made real progress digging our way out of policies that gave us two prolonged wars, record deficits and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	19086	Are we closer to peace?	0
ClaimBuster	19087	We need to be strong, we need to be prepared to use that strength, but we must understand that we are a democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	19088	And we can't allow it to happen anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	19089	What we have right now in Washington is a place that's gridlocked.	0
ClaimBuster	19090	This is a very good step forward for our nation's security, and we'll continue to do as we have done in the past.	0
ClaimBuster	19091	But I can tell you this.	0
ClaimBuster	19092	And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	19093	This is what I have done.	1
ClaimBuster	19094	But you wouldn't change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.	1
ClaimBuster	19095	We're a nation that believes that we're all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled.	0
ClaimBuster	19096	A - More countries voted against us in Asia on this issue than voted with us.	1
ClaimBuster	19097	The fact is our borders are not as secure as they ought to be, and I'll make them secure.	0
ClaimBuster	19098	And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up.	0
ClaimBuster	19099	And I have had a couple of exceptions that I support - rape, incest and the life of the mother.	0
ClaimBuster	19100	"I wouldn't pick a judge who said that the Pledge of Allegiance couldn't be said in a school because it had the words ""under God"" in it."	0
ClaimBuster	19101	We can no longer afford to be second best.	0
ClaimBuster	19102	I don't know what the latest cost estimates are, but it's going to be in the range of 25, 50, 75, $100 billion.	0
ClaimBuster	19103	I've also suggested that on the domestic side there are areas where we can make some cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	19104	And so we were going to make sure that we finished the job.	0
ClaimBuster	19105	I know that doesn't directly talk about Hollywood, but it does reinforce the values you're teaching.	1
ClaimBuster	19106	When I'm president, I'm sending that back to Congress and we're going to get a real prescription drug benefit.	0
ClaimBuster	19107	Now, Senator Obama said, without preconditions.	1
ClaimBuster	19108	But, again, Senator Obama has shifted on a number of occasions.	1
ClaimBuster	19109	It's in my health-care proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	19110	We've given away whole industries.	1
ClaimBuster	19111	The guy that served us lunch gave me a letter today.	1
ClaimBuster	19112	And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.	1
ClaimBuster	19113	So I think it's clear that we're better off than we were four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	19114	When I'm President of the United States, I will keep my word.	0
ClaimBuster	19115	He was against the F - 14 fighter, he was against the M - 1 tank, he was against the B - 1 bomber, he wanted to cut the salary of all of the military, he wanted to bring home half of the American forces in Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	19116	So I'm glad I took on that fight and I believe, with all respect, I was right and he was wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	19117	So, obviously, if we can start increasing home values, then there will be creation of wealth.	0
ClaimBuster	19118	Of the 3 of us, I have balanced a government budget 12 times, I have offered and passed campaign finance reform, offered, pushed for and passed in public referendum lobbyist restrictions, done the kinds of things you have to do to get legislators together not only to establish consensus but to challenge them to change.	1
ClaimBuster	19119	"Now, there are people in this room and people on this stage who've been in meetings when I would sit there and say, ""Is this the one we're going to talk about or do something about?"""	0
ClaimBuster	19120	I guess you'd say I'm a good steward of the land.	0
ClaimBuster	19121	That is my agenda and that is why I think that it's not just a question of experience.	0
ClaimBuster	19122	I'll be glad to respond.	0
ClaimBuster	19123	... on some of the issues that people care about tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	19124	But I would never let that friendship with the People's Republic of China stand in the way of the preservation of the independence and freedom of the people on Taiwan.	0
ClaimBuster	19125	The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can't find work.	1
ClaimBuster	19126	Thanks to the miraculous sacrifice of doctors and nurses, the child stayed alive for six months and then died.	1
ClaimBuster	19127	I can make American safer than President Bush has made us.	0
ClaimBuster	19128	We established eighty-four new mental health treatment centers.	1
ClaimBuster	19129	And then long-term we've got to fix our health care system, we've got to fix our energy system that is putting such an enormous burden on families.	0
ClaimBuster	19130	I don't disagree with anything that the President said, except he waited four years to do these things, and my view is it ought to be, it will be done on Day 1.	0
ClaimBuster	19131	But it's also that his entire life he has never forgotten where he came from, coming from Scranton, fighting on behalf of working families, remembering what it's like to see his father lose his job and go through a downward spiral economically.	1
ClaimBuster	19132	That's the main growing thing in the budget.	0
ClaimBuster	19133	I believe that the United States ha- had many successes in recent years, in recent months, as far as the Communist movement is concerned.	0
ClaimBuster	19134	As well, help is on the way, but it's certainly hard to tell it when he voted against the $87-billion supplemental to provide equipment for our troops, and then said he actually did vote for it before he voted against it.	1
ClaimBuster	19135	America gained by continuing the dignity, the decency that has characterized us and it's that that keeps the prestige of America up, not running down America the way Senator Kennedy has been running her down.	0
ClaimBuster	19136	And if we meet our responsibilities I think freedom will conquer.	0
ClaimBuster	19137	Yeah, no question about that, but there also needs to be strong enforcement of the law.	0
ClaimBuster	19138	So we have to look at this comprehensively.	0
ClaimBuster	19139	You'll live in a world, hopefully, that is more educated so it's less likely you'll be harmed in your neighborhood.	0
ClaimBuster	19140	By the president having five powers - four or five powers - and he only has very limited powers today, neither the company nor the union would be sure which power would be used; and therefore, there would be a greater incentive on both sides to reach an agreement themselves without taking it to the government.	0
ClaimBuster	19141	I proposed a constitutional amendment.	1
ClaimBuster	19142	Testing is the cornerstone of reform.	0
ClaimBuster	19143	When I'm President of the United States we're going to have a governors' council and we're going to work directly with the governors to get power back to the people and back to the states.	0
ClaimBuster	19144	Everything comes out of your pocket and my pocket.	1
ClaimBuster	19145	I think that militarily we are as strong as any nation on earth.	0
ClaimBuster	19146	He has done a superb job in getting the prime minister of South Africa, Mr. Vorster, to agree that the time had come for a solution to the problem of Rhodesia.	1
ClaimBuster	19147	But I'll tell you what I was thinking of.	0
ClaimBuster	19148	But that -- that is not the case.	0
ClaimBuster	19149	But it isn't going to be working that way.	0
ClaimBuster	19150	Most health-care costs are covered by third parties.	1
ClaimBuster	19151	What I've seen -- what I've seen is so bad.	0
ClaimBuster	19152	I was in the Senate before I became secretary of state.	1
ClaimBuster	19153	What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens?	0
ClaimBuster	19154	And those teachers can make a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	19155	$3,000 tax credit to help your expenses in taking care of a loved one who needs long-term care.	0
ClaimBuster	19156	What I criticized was the failure of the Administration to use its great influence to persuade the Cuban government to hold free elections, particularly in 1957 and 1958.	0
ClaimBuster	19157	It's to make sure we have fiscal sanity and keep taxes low.	0
ClaimBuster	19158	I look at Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	19159	Whether it's Iran-contra, Iraq-gate or you name it, it's a steady stream.	0
ClaimBuster	19160	I think the people should understand that two-thirds of the defense budget pays for pay and salary, or pay and pension.	1
ClaimBuster	19161	When we think of Russia, remember we're thinking of many countries, now.	0
ClaimBuster	19162	He didn't succeed and I signed it and I'm glad I did.	1
ClaimBuster	19163	We have gone a long way toward correcting these problems, but we still have a long way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	19164	We could look also at other items which Senator Kennedy has named, but I will only conclude by saying this: in this whole matter of prestige, in the final analysis, its whether you stand for what's right.	0
ClaimBuster	19165	Now, the question is, can we win?	0
ClaimBuster	19166	That's what Washington, D.C. needs.	0
ClaimBuster	19167	And there's a whole bunch of other things that I can't click off in this short period of time.	0
ClaimBuster	19168	What we're now talking about is the Vice President's determination to guarantee Quemoy and Matsu, which are four and five miles off the coast of Red China, which are not within the treaty area.	1
ClaimBuster	19169	I want to make America as great as it can be and I ask for your help in doing it.	0
ClaimBuster	19170	I said, do you get audited?	0
ClaimBuster	19171	But each and every one of us can start thinking about how can we save energy in our homes, in our buildings.	0
ClaimBuster	19172	But no president of the United States, in my opinion, should signal in advance to a prospective enemy, what his uhh - decision might be or what option he might exercise.	0
ClaimBuster	19173	And unfortunately now he is trying to reassert himself in Serbian politics.	0
ClaimBuster	19174	They're moving about eight or nine days in Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	19175	And thank God, it has, because the parents of these young people around here go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war.	0
ClaimBuster	19176	And it's very important that we not continue to let our industrial base deteriorate.	0
ClaimBuster	19177	Donald, she has a name.	1
ClaimBuster	19178	And when he crossed the line, I stood up and looked into the camera and I said: This aggression will not stand.	1
ClaimBuster	19179	Now it's in over 30 countries.	1
ClaimBuster	19180	They pulled out of the global warming, declared it dead, didn't even accept the science.	1
ClaimBuster	19181	I believe parents ought to be able to make more choices need more public and charter school choice to send their kids always to a safe school.	0
ClaimBuster	19182	But when the president of the United States is doing something that's right, something that is for the purpose of defending the security of this country against surprise attack, he can never express regrets or apologize to anybody, including Mr. Khrushchev.	0
ClaimBuster	19183	We have got to pull together.	0
ClaimBuster	19184	And the result over time was the Taliban, Al Qaida, and a lot of the difficulties we are facing today.	0
ClaimBuster	19185	And we're going to have to eliminate those that aren't working.	0
ClaimBuster	19186	I do think that sensible gun safety measures are warranted now.	0
ClaimBuster	19187	The quality of the air is cleaner since I've been the president of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	19188	My opponent voted against it.	1
ClaimBuster	19189	We have every two years tests that look at how well our kids are doing.	1
ClaimBuster	19190	I mean, there's-I don't think this is a fair argument.	0
ClaimBuster	19191	Here we are with a government that's been dealing with a drug-running Panamanian dictator.	1
ClaimBuster	19192	My record going back to 1965 in the Congress, the first vote we had was whether or not you should put a little notice on cigarettes.	1
ClaimBuster	19193	And we can renew and rekindle the American spirit and make our future what our founders dreamed it could be.	0
ClaimBuster	19194	And because we didn't listen to the freeze advocates, and strengthen the defense of this country, we now have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age.	1
ClaimBuster	19195	This is not an easy situation.	0
ClaimBuster	19196	If we make the right choices, we can have a prosperity that endures and enriches all of our people.	0
ClaimBuster	19197	Now, I said there was a contrast.	1
ClaimBuster	19198	And if you really want to get involved, just tap into my home page, www.DoleKemp96.org.	0
ClaimBuster	19199	What kind of rights will Americans have?	0
ClaimBuster	19200	I don't claim to know all the answers.	0
ClaimBuster	19201	It's a question between trust and fear, and I would say, I think, Mr. President, about all you've got going in this campaign is fear.	0
ClaimBuster	19202	Here are some promises that I'll make to you now.	0
ClaimBuster	19203	It isn't just naive; it's dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	19204	An economy that has 23 million people looking for work is not a strong economy.	1
ClaimBuster	19205	I also believe in the Golden Rule.	0
ClaimBuster	19206	The American working man and woman are not taxed too little.	0
ClaimBuster	19207	I merely say that the United States should meet its commitments to Que- to uh - Formosa and the Pescadores.	0
ClaimBuster	19208	Obviously, that law waived the statute of limitations, which you could have gone back 20 or 30 years.	1
ClaimBuster	19209	That is the bottom line.	0
ClaimBuster	19210	Well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted.	1
ClaimBuster	19211	Well, I hope all of those Americans out there who are watching us, listening to us and trying to make up their mind about which one of us ought to be president of the United States listen to the Vice President very carefully.	0
ClaimBuster	19212	I think it would be contrary to one of the basic concepts in our system of government - a system of checks and balances.	0
ClaimBuster	19213	First of all, vouchers are up to states.	0
ClaimBuster	19214	So I'm happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I've done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead, with your 30 years, and I'll let the American people make that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	19215	Now, referring to your question with regard to Quemoy and Matsu.	0
ClaimBuster	19216	But if you want change, you need to get somebody that knows how to bring Republicans and Democrats together to get positive things done for America.	0
ClaimBuster	19217	In order to lead, you first have to use the White House as a bully pulpit and lead; then you have to develop consensus or you can't get anything done, and that's where we are now.	0
ClaimBuster	19218	I thought we were going to have equal time, but maybe I just have to interrupt the other 2.	0
ClaimBuster	19219	If it's administered swiftly, justly and fairly, it saves lives.	0
ClaimBuster	19220	And -- and that is not a right strategy for us to move forward.	0
ClaimBuster	19221	Number one, I want to build manufacturing jobs in this country again.	0
ClaimBuster	19222	They ought to say this is the most important thing we do as a state.	0
ClaimBuster	19223	I'm just gonna tell you what the real facts are.	0
ClaimBuster	19224	In 1988 when the war between Iraq and Iran ended, we knew Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, we had dealt with him because he was against Iran -- the enemy of my enemy maybe is my friend.	1
ClaimBuster	19225	And I can recall cases where people would cross the street rather than meet somebody in a wheelchair.	0
ClaimBuster	19226	But with General Ridgway, Mr. Herter, General Collins, Admiral Spruance and many others, I think it's unwise to take the chance of being dragged into a war which may lead to a world war over two islands which are not strategically defensible, which are not, according to their testimony, essential to the defense of Formosa.	0
ClaimBuster	19227	We got to have health care for all Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	19228	That is my commitment to you.	0
ClaimBuster	19229	But I didn't pick Lloyd Bentsen because he was a clone of Mike Dukakis.	1
ClaimBuster	19230	Let's put the American people to work, and let's build the kind of high-tech, high-wage, high-growth economy that the American people deserve.	0
ClaimBuster	19231	Another one is to invest and save and to stimulate growth.	0
ClaimBuster	19232	We've done a lot to give the people more powers to make their own decisions over their own lives.	1
ClaimBuster	19233	We reduced more regulations, eliminated more programs than my two Republican predecessors.	1
ClaimBuster	19234	You deal with Russia based on, what are your -- what are the national security interests of the United States of America?	0
ClaimBuster	19235	Senator Obama has approved storage and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.	1
ClaimBuster	19236	Put it to you bluntly, American people.	0
ClaimBuster	19237	Mondale was referring to an earlier debate between George Bush and Geraldine Ferarro, the Vice-Presidential candidates.	1
ClaimBuster	19238	Senator Kennedy has said tonight again what he has said several times in the course of this - these debates and in the campaign, that American is standing still.	1
ClaimBuster	19239	And after we reform it, it won't be a lifetime career opportunity; good people will go serve and then go back to their homes and not become foreign lobbyists and cash in at 30,000 bucks a month and then take time off to run some president's campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	19240	In fact, just recently steelworkers in Ohio and throughout the Midwest -- Pennsylvania -- are in a position now to sell steel to China because we won that case.	1
ClaimBuster	19241	Otherwise, if we find the heads of state meeting and not making progress, we will find that the cause of peace will have been hurt rather than helped.	0
ClaimBuster	19242	You know, he said some time ago, he said he would forgo his tax increases if the economy was bad.	1
ClaimBuster	19243	I don't want to --	0
ClaimBuster	19244	So this is the way the president has overextended the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	19245	And I just said to you earlier, town hall meeting after town hall meeting, parents come with kids, children -- precious children who have autism.	1
ClaimBuster	19246	We've got one in Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	19247	Tonight I say to the President: Mr. Bush, for 12 years you've had it your way.	0
ClaimBuster	19248	He did not do so.	1
ClaimBuster	19249	The governor has declined to endorse that idea even though the Republican as well as Democratic leaders in Congress have endorsed it.	1
ClaimBuster	19250	The average senior citizen is spending a higher percentage of income on health care today than they were in 1965, before Medicare came in.	1
ClaimBuster	19251	Now, I'm going to restore what we did in the 1990s, ladies and gentlemen: pay as you go.	0
ClaimBuster	19252	I'm going to spend some money on the key issues that we've got to work on.	0
ClaimBuster	19253	First of all, Israel is a true friend.	1
ClaimBuster	19254	You didn't want a status of...	0
ClaimBuster	19255	We went over, we got them out, we brought them back home.	1
ClaimBuster	19256	And he said also that his two favorite justices are Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas.	1
ClaimBuster	19257	And to give them technology of this kind, I disagree with.	0
ClaimBuster	19258	We would have to stretch out our aircraft procurement, we would have to reduce our naval construction program, we would have to reduce the uh - research and development for the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and Marines by 8 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	19259	And, Alan (ph), thank you for your question.	0
ClaimBuster	19260	They want to make sure that they have a roof over their heads and that they have the prospects of a better life in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	19261	It can be a single-parent family.	0
ClaimBuster	19262	It's an example of how oftentimes we may be associated with organizations all of whose particular positions we don't support, even though we support in general the hope that over time, particularly if we can get those reductions in strategic weapons, if we can get a comprehensive test ban treaty, if we can negotiate with the Soviet Union and bring down the level of conventional forces in Europe with deeper cuts in the Soviet side, yes, at some point it may be possible to reduce defense outlays and use those for important things here at home, like jobs and job training and college opportunity and health and housing and the environment and the things that all of us care about.	0
ClaimBuster	19263	In the last three months before an election, they're always for the programs that they always fight the other three-and-one-half years.	1
ClaimBuster	19264	One of the additional powers that I would suggest would be seizure.	0
ClaimBuster	19265	And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they've not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices.	1
ClaimBuster	19266	I think, habitually, Governor Reagan has advocated the injection of military forces into troubled areas, when I and my predecessors - both Democrats and Republicans - have advocated resolving those troubles in those difficult areas of the world peacefully, diplomatically, and through negotiation.	0
ClaimBuster	19267	More and more people get on the rolls as poverty increases.	1
ClaimBuster	19268	We landed on this Eastern shore and then went out over the mountains and the prairies and the deserts and the far western mountains to the Pacific, building cities and towns and farms, and schools and churches.	1
ClaimBuster	19269	And I pay for every dime of it.	0
ClaimBuster	19270	All of these things can be done.	0
ClaimBuster	19271	But, also, I have the ability, and the knowledge, and the background to make the right judgments, to keep this country safe and secure.	0
ClaimBuster	19272	I don't see any evidence that it's a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime.	0
ClaimBuster	19273	Actually, Mitch McConnell had a minimum-wage plan that I supported that would have increased the minimum wage.	1
ClaimBuster	19274	People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do.	0
ClaimBuster	19275	It ought not to be a strength of bombast and threats.	0
ClaimBuster	19276	Americans ought to have it too.	0
ClaimBuster	19277	My answer is, we're not going to spend taxpayers' money on abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	19278	We need to have a new look about how we conduct ourselves in office.	0
ClaimBuster	19279	There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.	0
ClaimBuster	19280	During this campaign we've seen a lot of television shows, a lot of bumper stickers, and a great many uh - slogans of one kind or another.	0
ClaimBuster	19281	On the Amendment that you mentioned, I abandoned it 15 years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	19282	It puts a heavy burden on a state like -- except for emergencies.	0
ClaimBuster	19283	Well, I would say in the latter that the - and that's what I found uh - somewhat unsatisfactory about the figures uh - Mr. Nixon, that you used in your previous speech, when you talked about the Truman Administration.	0
ClaimBuster	19284	They've cut the training money.	1
ClaimBuster	19285	I can tell you, it's rife.	0
ClaimBuster	19286	Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries.	1
ClaimBuster	19287	And fourth, I believe that the polls and other studies and votes in the United Nations and anyone reading the paper and any citizen of the United States must come to the conclusion that the United States no longer carries the same image of a vital society on the move with its brightest days ahead as it carried a decade or two decades ago.	0
ClaimBuster	19288	Perhaps some of that land needs to be set aside.	0
ClaimBuster	19289	She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people.	1
ClaimBuster	19290	Now, I did want to pick up on one of the statements earlier, and maybe I have heard, maybe I have heard the previous statements wrong, Governor.	0
ClaimBuster	19291	What about drugs that have increased, doubled in the last 44 months?	1
ClaimBuster	19292	It means their job is tougher.	0
ClaimBuster	19293	Just -- just -- just a quick follow-up, because I think -- I think this is important.	0
ClaimBuster	19294	This is what it takes to have a sound foreign policy strong at home, strong defense, permanent commitments, not betray the principles of our country, and involve the American people and the Congress in the shaping of our foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	19295	Another is to pass -- to get our seniors to sign up to these drug discount cards, and they're working.	0
ClaimBuster	19296	Make your decision and vote on November the 3rd.	0
ClaimBuster	19297	I'm for research and development.	0
ClaimBuster	19298	Uh - in the crisis of 1973 it was supposed to be a temporary agency, uh now it's permanent, it's enormous, it's growing every day.	1
ClaimBuster	19299	Barbara, one of the blights on this world is the threat and the activities of terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	19300	"He keeps saying, ""Look, I've created 5 million jobs."""	1
ClaimBuster	19301	I've got some news, Senator Obama, the news is bad.	0
ClaimBuster	19302	Why can't they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we've knocked out the leaders, we've had a tremendous success?	0
ClaimBuster	19303	There's a bill on the floor of the United States Senate that he could have showed up and voted for if he's so much for it.	1
ClaimBuster	19304	Obviously energy is going to be a big, big factor.	0
ClaimBuster	19305	No president had ever taken on the tobacco lobby before.	1
ClaimBuster	19306	I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual.	0
ClaimBuster	19307	Number three, we've got to control our own energy.	0
ClaimBuster	19308	I went to meet with the members of the Security Council in the week before we voted.	1
ClaimBuster	19309	Some small business owners, a lot of them, can't even afford health insurance for themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	19310	I think there are things to do in this regard.	0
ClaimBuster	19311	He is out there on out of the mainstream.	0
ClaimBuster	19312	Well, look, I understand your frustration and your cynicism, because while you've been carrying out your responsibilities -- most of the people here, you've got a family budget.	0
ClaimBuster	19313	But I don't think private schools should have a right to take taxpayer money away from public schools at a time when Caley Ellis is standing in that classroom.	0
ClaimBuster	19314	The American people want to keep opening doors.	0
ClaimBuster	19315	And I believe it'll work because, as Ross said, we got the plans.	0
ClaimBuster	19316	It will help change the world; that we can look back and say we did our duty.	0
ClaimBuster	19317	That's not the kind of small business promotion we need.	0
ClaimBuster	19318	A testimony to you, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	19319	And obviously we hope that diplomacy works before you ever use force.	0
ClaimBuster	19320	I think the American people deserve better than they're getting.	0
ClaimBuster	19321	I'm for working with the groups, not just with industry but also with the citizen groups and local communities to control sprawl in ways that the local communities themselves come up with.	1
ClaimBuster	19322	Providing funding to universities and think tanks is great.	0
ClaimBuster	19323	The elements of government through these tax incentives For example, a business that would not have, for a period of time, an increase in the property tax reflecting its development of the unused property that it was making wouldn't be any loss to the city because the city isn't getting any tax from that now.	1
ClaimBuster	19324	As I indicated, our objectives are to replace Assad and to have in place a new government which is friendly to us, a responsible government, if possible.	1
ClaimBuster	19325	That's what a President's for.	0
ClaimBuster	19326	Interesting phenomenon: small towns have good schools, big cities have terrible schools.	0
ClaimBuster	19327	I just want to take one of those points, again, attacking me as not talking about an agenda for -- for getting more trade and opening up more jobs in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	19328	Maybe in your case maybe just two.	0
ClaimBuster	19329	These were areas on which Senator Dole and I differed, but I believed they were the right areas for America to be acting together as one country to help individuals and families make the most of their own lives and raise their kids with good values and a good future.	0
ClaimBuster	19330	We're doing the best we possibly can to share information.	0
ClaimBuster	19331	And I think that's the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	19332	As a matter of fact, when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary -- elected a Republican senator to stop Obamacare, you pushed it through anyway.	1
ClaimBuster	19333	And now they're campaigning on getting prescription drugs for seniors.	1
ClaimBuster	19334	Which is a big mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	19335	And I think we've now got so many examples around the country that we really have to find ways to end this.	0
ClaimBuster	19336	But I can say that I am dedicated to proceeding, and I met just last week with the foreign minister of the Soviet Union, and he indicated to me that uh - the Soviet Union was interested in narrowing the differences and making a realistic and a sound compromise.	1
ClaimBuster	19337	And how do we do that?	0
ClaimBuster	19338	We relied on the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Middle East, which passed the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	19339	She doesn't want to say that, but that's what's happened, and that's what happened big league.	1
ClaimBuster	19340	It's taken months and months and months to get Mr. Bush and the administration to support that legislation, and they're still resisting.	1
ClaimBuster	19341	I believe a free Afghanistan is in this nation's interest.	0
ClaimBuster	19342	If you look at what's happened -- we've made progress, I want to say that at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	19343	I have my own little foundation that's raised about $10 million for the disabled.	1
ClaimBuster	19344	Give the government back to the people.	0
ClaimBuster	19345	I hadn't gotten around to reregistering as yet.	1
ClaimBuster	19346	He says that he's going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform, but we don't know exactly which ones.	1
ClaimBuster	19347	I do understand how to make things work.	0
ClaimBuster	19348	For a while, as I recall, it even seems to me that there was talk of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana and other drugs, and I think that's all wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	19349	I remember getting my future back from doctors and nurses and a doctor in Chicago named Dr. Kalikian .	1
ClaimBuster	19350	We find that more have been built in this Administration than in the previous Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	19351	Depends on how we respond to Russia and it depends on a lot of things.	0
ClaimBuster	19352	And as a result, they're like tinderboxes.	0
ClaimBuster	19353	It is because we've had 12 years of trickle down economics.	1
ClaimBuster	19354	Wear your safety toe shoes when you go.	0
ClaimBuster	19355	Give us a balanced budget amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	19356	He says he's for voluntary testing.	1
ClaimBuster	19357	There were seventy votes for our position and none for theirs.	1
ClaimBuster	19358	I'm going to protect the working man by continuing to veto, and to threaten to veto until we get this new Congress, and then we're going to move forward on our plan.	0
ClaimBuster	19359	But it wou- uh - evidently uh - under the handling of the case it was not.	0
ClaimBuster	19360	Our relationship with the People's Republic of China is based upon the Shanghai Communique, of 1972, and that communique, calls for the normalization of relations between the United States and the People's Republic.	1
ClaimBuster	19361	General Brown has an exemply [sic] record of military performance.	1
ClaimBuster	19362	It's wind, tide, solar, natural gas, nuclear, off-shore drilling, which Senator Obama has opposed.	1
ClaimBuster	19363	"He won't use the term ""radical Islamic terrorism."""	0
ClaimBuster	19364	The present leadership uh - there is uh - is fairly uniform in - in their purpose, and I think it's a close-knit group, uh - and uh - I think it would be unwise for us to say that we will go to war uh - in Yugoslavia uh - if the Soviets should invade, which I think would be an extremely unlikely thing.	0
ClaimBuster	19365	I support a strong national patient's bill of rights.	1
ClaimBuster	19366	But of the people listening tonight, the working families who will benefit from economic packages, they'll be better off when Bob Dole is president and Jack Kemp is vice president.	0
ClaimBuster	19367	That's got to be changed.	0
ClaimBuster	19368	I've been for faith-based initiatives helping to intervene in the lives of young children for years.	1
ClaimBuster	19369	And I merely say that they - if they elect me president, I will do my best to carry the United States through a difficult period; but I would not want people to elect me because I promised them the easy, soft life.	0
ClaimBuster	19370	The last candidate who indicated that he knew who his cabinet was going to be was Mr. Dewey in 1948.	1
ClaimBuster	19371	But people make their own choice.	0
ClaimBuster	19372	Well, we stand with Israel, but we have maintained the ability to serve as an honest broker.	1
ClaimBuster	19373	And I have budgeted for that.	1
ClaimBuster	19374	An Air Force General not too long ago in Europe who said that pretty soon we'd have airplanes without engines, tank commanders who can't drive their tanks more than three-quarters of a mile, because they don't have enough fuel.	1
ClaimBuster	19375	When he ran for the United States Senate from Illinois, he said he would have a middle-income tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	19376	It is breaking family budgets.	0
ClaimBuster	19377	I'll restore that $716 billion to Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	19378	But understand, we only have three to four percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil, which means that we can't drill our way out of the problem.	1
ClaimBuster	19379	I think my plan is better.	0
ClaimBuster	19380	If you look at his record in the Senate, he voted to break the caps -- the spending caps -- over 200 times.	1
ClaimBuster	19381	So to answer your question is, we're withdrawing, not from the world, we're withdrawing manpower so they can be stationed here in America, so there's less rotation, so life is easier on their families and therefore more likely to be -- we'll be more likely to be able to keep people in the all-volunteer army.	0
ClaimBuster	19382	Yeah, in the Reagan recession where unemployment hit 10.8 percent, between that period -- the end of that recession and the equivalent of time to today, Ronald Reagan's recovery created twice as many jobs as this president's recovery.	1
ClaimBuster	19383	I believe it's important to resist the temptation to squander our surplus.	0
ClaimBuster	19384	And your co-payments and deductibles have gone up 30 percent just in the last year alone.	1
ClaimBuster	19385	I can tell you that if you were to elect President Obama, you know what you're going to get.	0
ClaimBuster	19386	These are constitutional rights, and I want to make sure we have judges who interpret the Constitution of the United States according to the law.	1
ClaimBuster	19387	Because NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	19388	And I would say to those I know there are more young people experimenting with drugs today than ever before; drug use has gone up.	1
ClaimBuster	19389	To this day, he has never had a hearing.	1
ClaimBuster	19390	Affirmative action doesn't mean quotas.	0
ClaimBuster	19391	See, all the folks up there at the top said the attention span of the American people is no more than 5 minutes, they won't watch it.	1
ClaimBuster	19392	But we also have to be smart, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	19393	Should the President's age and stamina be an issue in the political campaign?	0
ClaimBuster	19394	I'm totally opposed to diverting one out of every six dollars out of the Social Security trust fund, as the Governor has proposed, into the stock market.	1
ClaimBuster	19395	I believe, though -- I believe, as sure as I'm sitting here, that most Americans really care.	0
ClaimBuster	19396	There's lots we can do in the Pentagon where dishonest contractors have been lining their pockets at the expense of the American taxpayer.	0
ClaimBuster	19397	And that means that we can't have any test of religion.	0
ClaimBuster	19398	Now, does that mean you're not struggling?	0
ClaimBuster	19399	And I think you can use the White House as a bully pulpit to stress the importance of these little children, particularly in their young and formative years, to mold these little precious pieces of clay so that they, too, can live rich full lives when they're grown.	0
ClaimBuster	19400	Far be it from me to suggest otherwise.	0
ClaimBuster	19401	You know, back in April, I put out a statement saying that the situation in Georgia was unsustainable because you had Russian peacekeepers in these territories that were under dispute.	1
ClaimBuster	19402	I don't believe trickle down economics will work.	0
ClaimBuster	19403	But we don't use those people.	1
ClaimBuster	19404	And incidentally, we have got to preserve Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	19405	The United States cannot continue to carry the major share of this burden by itself.	0
ClaimBuster	19406	I don't believe in discrimination.	0
ClaimBuster	19407	This president has left them in shatters across the globe, and we're now 90 percent of the casualties in Iraq and 90 percent of the costs.	1
ClaimBuster	19408	I mean, you've got to stand up and fight somewhere, folks.	0
ClaimBuster	19409	That means that in the middle of the next decade, any car you buy, you're going to end up going twice as far on a gallon of gas.	1
ClaimBuster	19410	We cannot cast aside these regulations.	0
ClaimBuster	19411	And I think where I differ with the Governor of Massachusetts, because I am optimistic.	0
ClaimBuster	19412	Maybe in Idaho, to take care of the requirements, nuclear material requirements, for our Defense Department?	0
ClaimBuster	19413	No, there's been no change of heart.	0
ClaimBuster	19414	General McKiernan, the commander in Afghanistan right now, is desperate for more help, because our bases and outposts are now targets for more aggressive Afghan -- Taliban offenses.	1
ClaimBuster	19415	They haven't formed a unity group, a council of some kind.	0
ClaimBuster	19416	But it's very hard for Republican's in Congress to support comprehensive immigration reform, if their standard bearer has said that, this is not something I'm interested in supporting.	0
ClaimBuster	19417	It would have destroyed the economy of California, and, I must say, we had the support of Congress when we pointed out how ridiculous this attempt was by the Environmental Protection Agency.	1
ClaimBuster	19418	Because they have the opportunity to reenter the community of nations, and we would welcome that.	0
ClaimBuster	19419	My brother probably died partly because of cigarettes.	0
ClaimBuster	19420	And congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary.	0
ClaimBuster	19421	I think that would be a mistake, because when I've sent young men and women into harm's way, I always understand that that is the last resort, not the first resort.	0
ClaimBuster	19422	I would suggest that these proposals could be mentioned.	0
ClaimBuster	19423	The Federal Government continues to spend too much.	0
ClaimBuster	19424	I would hope, under a different monetary policy, that it would be possible to reduce that interest-rate burden, at least a billion dollars.	0
ClaimBuster	19425	What I'm going to do is say to Jim Baker when this campaign is over, all right, let's sit down now, you do in domestic affairs what you've done in foreign affairs, be kind of the economic coordinator of all the domestic side of the House, and that includes all the economic side, all the training side, and bring this program together.	0
ClaimBuster	19426	Now, I'm all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera.	0
ClaimBuster	19427	And as I said, this is not a partisan thing with me.	0
ClaimBuster	19428	Liberal, conservative, you put whatever label you want on it.	0
ClaimBuster	19429	You can't do it on the war, where he says well, I was with the minority but I guess I would have voted with the majority.	1
ClaimBuster	19430	I think uh - the uh - increase and the uh - prospects as far as I'm concerned and the I - less favorable prospects for Governor Carter, reflect that Governor Carter uh - is inconsistent in many of the positions that he takes.	0
ClaimBuster	19431	Now, the new president of Pakistan, Kardari (sic), has got his hands full.	0
ClaimBuster	19432	And General Brown has indicated uh - his apology, his regrets, and I think that will, uh - in this situation, settle the matter.	1
ClaimBuster	19433	But why it is outrageous is because, for political advantage, every time they do that, they scare millions of senior citizens who are totally dependent on Social Security, have no place else to turn.	0
ClaimBuster	19434	The whole philosophy of the Republican party, including uh - my opponent, has been to pile on taxes on low-income people to take 'em off on the corporations.	0
ClaimBuster	19435	And so far as the summit conference is concerned, it should only be entered in upon, it should only be agreed upon, if the negotiations have reached the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other than some phony spirit - a spirit of Geneva, or Camp David, or whatever it is.	0
ClaimBuster	19436	They actually said that she lied.	1
ClaimBuster	19437	We spend more on education 'cause we spend so much more on colleges.	1
ClaimBuster	19438	And I'm very proud of that.	0
ClaimBuster	19439	I am absolutely -- I apologize for those words.	0
ClaimBuster	19440	And remember the Federal deficit has come down $70 billion in one year, in 1987.	1
ClaimBuster	19441	When we took office, we discovered that the program that the Carter-Mondale administration had said would solve the fiscal problems of Social Security for the next 50 years wouldn't solve them for 5.	1
ClaimBuster	19442	America is still the greatest producer, exporter and importer.	0
ClaimBuster	19443	I don't know which is worse, not knowing or knowing and not stopping it.	0
ClaimBuster	19444	We are currently spending $10 billion a month in Iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus.	1
ClaimBuster	19445	And, you know, we visited the website quite a bit and it still doesn't work.	1
ClaimBuster	19446	I believe we need to be strong, and I will keep us strong.	0
ClaimBuster	19447	Uh - I uh - agreed to give the interview uh - to Playboy Other people have done it who are notable - uh - Governor Jerry Brown, uh - Walter Cronkite, uh - Albert Schweitzer, Mr. Ford's own secretary of the treasury, Mr. Simon, uh - William Buckley - many other people.	1
ClaimBuster	19448	But I want a diverse administration, I think it's important.	0
ClaimBuster	19449	So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal.	0
ClaimBuster	19450	And then the president began what I have called an apology tour, of going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America.	1
ClaimBuster	19451	"And when Governor Romney stands here, after a year of campaigning, when during a Republican primary he stood on stage and said ""I'm going to give tax cuts"" -- he didn't say tax rate cuts, he said ""tax cuts to everybody,"" including the top 1 percent, you should believe him because that's been his history."	1
ClaimBuster	19452	Because if we can keep our prosperity going, if we can continue balancing the budget and paying down the debt, then the strong economy keeps generating surpluses.	0
ClaimBuster	19453	The Social Security system was fixed about 5 years, and I think it's projected out to be sound beyond that.	1
ClaimBuster	19454	So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one.	0
ClaimBuster	19455	Nothing will ever top NAFTA.	0
ClaimBuster	19456	There is an issue with the uninsured, there sure is.	0
ClaimBuster	19457	She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website.	1
ClaimBuster	19458	And, you know, we've heard a lot about -- from the governor about not much being done in the last eight years, as if the promises that I made eight years ago have not been kept.	1
ClaimBuster	19459	And, obviously, stricter interpretation and consolidation of the various regulatory agencies that weren't doing their job, that has brought on this crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	19460	We believe that you can uhh - do something more effectively with a moderate increase in money in the drug abuse program.	0
ClaimBuster	19461	Joe wants to buy the business that he has been in for all of these years, worked 10, 12 hours a day.	0
ClaimBuster	19462	What we really should focus on tonight is what we still have to do to help the American people make the most of this future that's out there.	0
ClaimBuster	19463	I've just as high a devotion, just as high an opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	19464	And as long as they are not essential to the defense of Formosa, it's been my judgment ever since 1954, at the time of the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Far East, that our line should be drawn in the sea around the island itself.	0
ClaimBuster	19465	Since I became president, 43, 44 countries have gone democratic, no longer totalitarian, no longer living under dictatorship or communist rule.	1
ClaimBuster	19466	And Detroit had dragged its feet too long in terms of getting that done.	0
ClaimBuster	19467	I get the casualty reports every day.	1
ClaimBuster	19468	An economy with 50 percent of kids graduating from college that can't finds a job, or a college level job, that's not what we have to have.	1
ClaimBuster	19469	I would say Eastern Europe is the area of vulnerability of the uh - s- of the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	19470	So the United States, seeking to preserve the principle of self-determination, to eliminate the possibility of bloodshed, to protect the rights of the minority as we insisted upon the rights of the majority, uh - I believe followed the good conscience of the American people in foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	19471	... the irony is that we've seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there.	1
ClaimBuster	19472	And I guarantee you he would not -- he would not say that presidential top level.	0
ClaimBuster	19473	Now, you and I never got a ride on a lot of these yachts and fancy things it bought, but you and I are paying for it.	1
ClaimBuster	19474	Well, look, you know, I think that we expect presidential campaigns to be tough.	0
ClaimBuster	19475	You called it the gold standard of trade deals.	1
ClaimBuster	19476	And if we do, you don't have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine.	0
ClaimBuster	19477	The president gave the top 1 percent of income-earners in America, got $89 billion last year, more than the 80 percent of people who earn $100,000 or less all put together.	1
ClaimBuster	19478	I never suggested espionage should stop.	1
ClaimBuster	19479	Well, I'm not for photo licensing.	0
ClaimBuster	19480	In addition to that, I believe that this element of discrimination is something that the South has seen so vividly as a blight on our region of the country which has now been corrected - not only racial discrimination but discrimination against people that have to work for a living - because we have been trying to pick ourselves up by our bootstraps, since the long depression years, and lead a full and useful life in the affairs of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	19481	Now, I know that the only way he can win is to make everybody believe the economy's worse than it is.	0
ClaimBuster	19482	Once you have a policy, then you have to go out and be aggressive and enforce that policy.	0
ClaimBuster	19483	You indicated that we shouldn't be passing nuclear treaties with Russia despite the fact that 71 senators, Democrats and Republicans, voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	19484	But the name is there.	0
ClaimBuster	19485	But our long-term security depends on our deep faith in liberty.	0
ClaimBuster	19486	The size of government increased only one-sixth in California of what it increased in proportion to the population in Georgia.	1
ClaimBuster	19487	In addition, we're now able to transition out of Afghanistan in a responsible way, making sure that Afghans take responsibility for their own security.	0
ClaimBuster	19488	"I'm sorry we didn't have a foreign policy question, because just this week Secretary Christopher said, ""Well, we really didn't know much the first couple of years about foreign policy."""	0
ClaimBuster	19489	But it is also essential that he not allow a dollar spent that could be better spent by the people themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	19490	It can and will grow even more in the next four.	0
ClaimBuster	19491	Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up.	1
ClaimBuster	19492	It's a subject I'm very familiar with.	1
ClaimBuster	19493	That's why it's essential we win.	0
ClaimBuster	19494	With all due respect, you already gave them to the oil companies.	1
ClaimBuster	19495	And we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties.	0
ClaimBuster	19496	You've got to help us over there.	0
ClaimBuster	19497	Last week he said that they were spending 3.7 billion dollars, or 4.7 billion dollars on this.	1
ClaimBuster	19498	No, I'm not sure I can promise that; I don't think either one of us can really.	0
ClaimBuster	19499	He can say now that he no longer believes that a line should be drawn leaving these islands out of the perimeter of defense.	0
ClaimBuster	19500	But every economist - liberal, conservative that I'm familiar with - recognizes that in the fourth quarter of this year and in the fifth quar- uh - the first quarter of next year that we'll have an increase in real GNP.	0
ClaimBuster	19501	I believe in the Patriot Act.	0
ClaimBuster	19502	I find that deeply disturbing.	0
ClaimBuster	19503	We're talking about adding to or increasing 200 programs, 20,000 new bureaucrats.	1
ClaimBuster	19504	I appreciate your -- your question, and thank you for being here this evening and to all of those from Nassau County that have come, thank you for your time.	0
ClaimBuster	19505	And I promise you tonight that I'll try to address your concerns and not try to exploit them.	0
ClaimBuster	19506	Why not leave it with them?	0
ClaimBuster	19507	I stood there, and I met the people.	1
ClaimBuster	19508	No, there's no difference on that.	0
ClaimBuster	19509	It doesn't speak to the equality of America.	0
ClaimBuster	19510	Anyway, that's for another debate.	0
ClaimBuster	19511	That's why I have a plan for energy independence within 10 years.	0
ClaimBuster	19512	I found a couple of other things we agree upon.	0
ClaimBuster	19513	And the other thing I think is important...	0
ClaimBuster	19514	The question, I think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place?	0
ClaimBuster	19515	But we were succeeding to the point that the Lebanese Government had been organized -- if you will remember, there were the meetings in Geneva in which they began to meet with the hostile factional forces and try to put together some kind of a peace plan.	1
ClaimBuster	19516	And I want to tell you that one of the things I'm most proud of, among others, because I have worked across the aisle.	1
ClaimBuster	19517	And he said this about it.	0
ClaimBuster	19518	I think we've got to be very careful when we commit our troops.	0
ClaimBuster	19519	We've got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science.	0
ClaimBuster	19520	Now, that, I think, is one of the most serious, sort of, reversals or mixed messages that you could possibly send.	0
ClaimBuster	19521	I saw cases in West Virginia, here in the United States, where children took home part of their school lunch in order to feed their families because I don't think we're meeting our obligations toward these Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	19522	Her client she represented got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.	1
ClaimBuster	19523	Now we have a chance.	0
ClaimBuster	19524	And therefore, it seems to me that we should hold the lid, as we have, to the best of our ability so we can stimulate the private economy and get the jobs where the jobs are - five out of six in this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	19525	What kind of programs are we for?	0
ClaimBuster	19526	I believe it incumbent upon the next president of the United States to get this country moving again, to get our economy moving ahead, to set before the American people its goals, its unfinished business.	0
ClaimBuster	19527	Now, what was his response?	0
ClaimBuster	19528	I had a record of working with Republicans and Democrats as the governor of Texas, and I was hopeful I'd be able to do the same thing.	1
ClaimBuster	19529	And I doubt in all candor if the president knows it.	0
ClaimBuster	19530	We have met young America.	0
ClaimBuster	19531	And first let me say that our nation now needs to speak with one voice during this time, and I applaud the president for working hard to diffuse tensions.	0
ClaimBuster	19532	That's why I have a program for education, a program in the case of equal job opportunities, and one that would also deal with our older citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	19533	So at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average.	1
ClaimBuster	19534	You know, his -- his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney's talked about.	1
ClaimBuster	19535	The question is, are people getting health care, and we have a strong safety net, and there needs to be a safety net in America.	0
ClaimBuster	19536	And I think we'll have some decrease in our disbursements.	0
ClaimBuster	19537	I'm not going to do that; I won't do that.	0
ClaimBuster	19538	And Business Week, which is not a Democratic publication, said that this Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal - and I quote them, I think - was completely irresponsible and would result in inflationary pressures which would destroy this nation.	1
ClaimBuster	19539	When I took office, the worst war in Europe was waging in Bosnia.	1
ClaimBuster	19540	The purpose of this debate and the outcome of the election will determine three basic things: Leadership, upholding the principles of our country, and proper priorities and commitments for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	19541	Because after eight years of failed policies, he and I both agree that what we're going to have to do is to reprioritize, make sure that we're investing in the American people, give tax cuts not to the wealthiest corporations, but give them to small businesses and give them to individuals who are struggling right now, make sure that we finally get serious about energy independence, something that has been languishing in Washington for 30 years, and make sure that our kids get a great education and can afford to go to college.	0
ClaimBuster	19542	I can't think of any.	0
ClaimBuster	19543	And I don't think it should do that.	0
ClaimBuster	19544	A $10,000 deduction a year for the cost of college tuition.	0
ClaimBuster	19545	Now in addition, we had a very - some very good news in the reduction in the rate of inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	19546	So I have to stand up for myself.	0
ClaimBuster	19547	I know the private sector is.	0
ClaimBuster	19548	And I hope you'll give me an opportunity to serve again.	0
ClaimBuster	19549	Because this is not just a -- a health issue, it's an economic issue for women.	0
ClaimBuster	19550	But in almost every category they're lagging.	1
ClaimBuster	19551	If I don't like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company.	0
ClaimBuster	19552	Mr. President, once again, I happen to be against the amendment, because I think the amendment will take this problem out of the hands of elected legislators and put it in the hands f unelected judges.	0
ClaimBuster	19553	I know we're not going to achieve our objective if we send mixed signals to our troops, our friends, the Iraqi citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	19554	And most Americans know the difference.	1
ClaimBuster	19555	Our military is meant to fight and win war.	0
ClaimBuster	19556	We need the missile, I think, because we are so out of balance strategically that we lack a deterrent to a possible first assault.	0
ClaimBuster	19557	But uh - if - if you could just do away with the ones that are unfair, you could lower taxes for everyone.	0
ClaimBuster	19558	The mayors that I've talked to in some of our leading cities tell!	0
ClaimBuster	19559	That's what the war on terror is about.	0
ClaimBuster	19560	Keep in mind in 1960, when our schools were the envy of the world, we were spending $16 billion on them; now we spend more than any other nation in the world -- 199 billion a year -- and rank at the bottom of the industrialized world in terms of education achievement.	1
ClaimBuster	19561	So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work.	0
ClaimBuster	19562	She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later.	0
ClaimBuster	19563	We've got to control that growth to inflation and population increase, but not raise taxes on the American people now.	0
ClaimBuster	19564	If we can come together, nothing can stop us.	0
ClaimBuster	19565	Well, Alan (ph), thank you very much for the question.	0
ClaimBuster	19566	Secretary Bill Perry negotiated that under President Clinton.	1
ClaimBuster	19567	I was not put on the ballot by either of the 2 parties; I was not put on the ballot by any PAC money, by any foreign lobbyist money, by any special interest money.	1
ClaimBuster	19568	I think government- run health will lead to poor-quality health, will lead to rationing, will lead to less choice.	0
ClaimBuster	19569	But we're bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	19570	That was not a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	19571	I want to reduce the size of the classrooms in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	19572	As far as aid for school construction is concerned, I favor that, as Senator Kennedy did, in January of this year, when he said he favored that rather than aid to s- teacher salaries.	1
ClaimBuster	19573	And if we do that, we can have an impact.	0
ClaimBuster	19574	That's an overwhelming support from my own people who know me best.	0
ClaimBuster	19575	I've asked in my security briefings why that is, and I can't go into all the answers, et cetera, but let me say this to you.	0
ClaimBuster	19576	If you have a child, you got a $1,000 child credit.	1
ClaimBuster	19577	And Colin Powell so stated.	1
ClaimBuster	19578	I'm going to give a new direction to this economy in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	19579	And in some ways, it may be difficult to -- to reconcile the two views.	0
ClaimBuster	19580	There ought to be filters in public libraries and filters in public schools so if kids get on the Internet, there is not going to be pornography or violence coming in.	0
ClaimBuster	19581	...of forces agreement at the end of the conflict that existed.	0
ClaimBuster	19582	And as commander-in-chief, that is something that I've worked on and thought about every single day that I've been in the Oval Office.	0
ClaimBuster	19583	Peter, it's one of the most agonizing decisions a president has to make.	0
ClaimBuster	19584	Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.	0
ClaimBuster	19585	My argument with Governor Clinton -- you can call it mud wrestling, but I think it's fair to put it in focus is -- I am deeply troubled by someone who demonstrates and organizes demonstration in a foreign land when his country's at war.	0
ClaimBuster	19586	Bob, let's not go into hypotheticals of that nature.	0
ClaimBuster	19587	Many people predicted what happened, and it was a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	19588	I take him for his word.	0
ClaimBuster	19589	Now, maybe I'm expected to ask that same question again.	0
ClaimBuster	19590	And a number of pages were excised by that agency head there, the man in charge, and he sent it on up here to CIA, where more pages were excised before it was printed.	1
ClaimBuster	19591	... the damage in his -- in his own party.	0
ClaimBuster	19592	This year Mr. Ford will not pass more than 26 percent of all the legislative proposals he puts forward.	0
ClaimBuster	19593	But let's stop labeling each other and lets' get to the heart of the matter which is the future of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	19594	And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	19595	They may be danger -- I voted I for everything since that time.	1
ClaimBuster	19596	If we're an arrogant nation, they'll resent us.	0
ClaimBuster	19597	As president of the United States, people are going to be held accountable in my administration.	0
ClaimBuster	19598	But it's important for us to recognize that we can't just walk away from Pakistan.	0
ClaimBuster	19599	Talk to the people that are working in those industries.	0
ClaimBuster	19600	I'm the president and I'm always responsible, and that's why nobody's more interested in finding out exactly what happened than I do.	1
ClaimBuster	19601	And they have been using these things to have government, through court orders, inhibit the practice of religion.	1
ClaimBuster	19602	But absolutely we can be secure in the long run.	0
ClaimBuster	19603	But I think that -- I just was watching some of the proceedings of the American Bankers Assn, and I think the general feeling is most of the banks are sound, certainly there's no comparison here between what happened to the S&Ls and where the banks stand right now, in my view.	0
ClaimBuster	19604	Actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth.	1
ClaimBuster	19605	So there's a great deal of cynicism out there.	0
ClaimBuster	19606	"He complains about the fact our troops don't have adequate equipment, yet he voted against the $87 billion supplemental I sent to the Congress and then issued one of the most amazing quotes in political history: ""I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it."""	1
ClaimBuster	19607	But let me talk just a minute about what we've done to avoid secrecy in the Ford administration.	0
ClaimBuster	19608	And the approach I took is one that I think is a balanced and necessary approach, to balance science and the concerns for life.	0
ClaimBuster	19609	Now, that's the kind of presidency I believe in.	0
ClaimBuster	19610	And the money is used to pay the benefits for seniors this year.	1
ClaimBuster	19611	It means our border patrol will be more likely to be able to focus on doing their job.	0
ClaimBuster	19612	I want people in my administration and will have people in my administration who understand America.	0
ClaimBuster	19613	I have proposed a league of democracies, a group of people - a group of countries that share common interests, common values, common ideals, they also control a lot of the world's economic power.	0
ClaimBuster	19614	He has not indicated his support of an attempt to provide fair employment practices around the country, so that everyone can get a job regardless of their race or color.	1
ClaimBuster	19615	Those are the concerns of the people that are watching us tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	19616	Not necessarily be in power, but here's what I'll say about the $87 billion.	0
ClaimBuster	19617	The average middle-class family with children would pay about $2,000 more.	1
ClaimBuster	19618	I would be willing to continue to raise the payment for shipment of goods through the Panama Canal Zone.	0
ClaimBuster	19619	If I'm the president, we're going to have emergency room care, we're going have gag orders, we're going to have direct access to OB/GYN.	0
ClaimBuster	19620	Everybody says it'll create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	19621	And that is fundamentally the wrong way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	19622	Now, why do I support the freeze?	0
ClaimBuster	19623	Have no environmental controls, no pollution controls and no retirement.	0
ClaimBuster	19624	So this rescue package means that we will stabilize markets, we will shore up these institutions.	0
ClaimBuster	19625	And this is -- this is Georgian territory.	1
ClaimBuster	19626	One of them is in defense spending, because I've taken on some of the defense contractors.	0
ClaimBuster	19627	Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney's going to have a busy first day, because he's also going to repeal Obamacare, which will not be very popular among Democrats as you're sitting down with them.	0
ClaimBuster	19628	Once a health-care program ends up in a line item in the federal government budget, it leads to more controls.	0
ClaimBuster	19629	Well, she said she was awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o'clock in the morning, but I won't even mention that.	1
ClaimBuster	19630	We are supposed to be operating under a U.N. resolution.	0
ClaimBuster	19631	I want you to have your own asset that you can call your own.	0
ClaimBuster	19632	This uh - talking about more people at work - uh is distorted because with a 14 percent increase in the cost of living in the last uh - two years, it means that - that women and young people have had to go to work when they didn't want to because their fathers didn't make enough to pay the increased cost of uh - food and uh housing and clothing.	1
ClaimBuster	19633	I don't think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and I don't think Senator Dole supports using using drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	19634	That was something that advanced the entire country.	0
ClaimBuster	19635	Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked.	1
ClaimBuster	19636	She went over a minute over, and you don't stop her.	1
ClaimBuster	19637	And he's called that because he's supposed to be in charge of the facts and run our government and strengthen our nation.	0
ClaimBuster	19638	And he could have lowered the cost of Medicare and lowered your taxes and lowered the costs to seniors.	0
ClaimBuster	19639	Secondly, we spend $4.7 billion a year on the uninsured in the State of Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	19640	Now, in my budget for the next ten years I propose $100 billion for this purpose.	0
ClaimBuster	19641	And I'm not gonna exclude the American people from that process in the future, as Mr. Ford and Kissinger have done.	1
ClaimBuster	19642	But we kept the debate going, and we kept this issue to -- to posing to Americans the danger that climate change opposes.	1
ClaimBuster	19643	And we'll have companies that will grow and expand and start from new.	0
ClaimBuster	19644	That's part of the reason why the Libyans stand with us.	0
ClaimBuster	19645	And this fellow stood up, and he was quivering.	1
ClaimBuster	19646	Third, we've got all kinds of agreements on paper, and some that are being executed on getting rid of nuclear warheads.	1
ClaimBuster	19647	Our housing programs have uh - gone bad.	1
ClaimBuster	19648	I want 100 percent of the American people to have a bright and prosperous future.	0
ClaimBuster	19649	Productivity in this country is up, it is way up -- productivity is up.	0
ClaimBuster	19650	Yes, it's a tough problem as Mr. Bush says, but itÃâ‚¬s not an insolvable problem.	0
ClaimBuster	19651	And we've got a wonderful new superintendent there who's working very hard with the young mayor there to try...	1
ClaimBuster	19652	What if we had a homestead act, and said to the people, for $1 we sell you this house.	0
ClaimBuster	19653	I just object to the fact that we cover up and hide things.	0
ClaimBuster	19654	"But the president just arbitrarily brought the hammer down and said, ""Nope."	1
ClaimBuster	19655	"When the Secretary General Kofi Annan offered the United Nations, he said, ""No, no, we'll go do this alone."""	1
ClaimBuster	19656	I helped double the NIH budget to $28 billion a year to find cures.	1
ClaimBuster	19657	We did, actually, send troops into Rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measures.	1
ClaimBuster	19658	But I will tell you what isn't fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	19659	And we are on pace to double our exports, one of the commitments I made when I was president.	1
ClaimBuster	19660	Didn't even guard the ammo dumps.	1
ClaimBuster	19661	Listen, there is 30 nations involved in Iraq, some 40 nations involved in Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	19662	You don't want to join the International Criminal Court just because it's popular in certain capitals in Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	19663	We've brought twice as many cases against unfair trading practices than the previous administration and we've won every single one that's been decided.	1
ClaimBuster	19664	Well, it's a combination, Chris.	0
ClaimBuster	19665	But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt.	1
ClaimBuster	19666	Mr. Bush vetoed it twice because he says we can't do something seventy-two other countries do, even though there was a small business exemption.	1
ClaimBuster	19667	A president can't do that.	0
ClaimBuster	19668	But it does say insurance companies can't jerk you around.	0
ClaimBuster	19669	I ask Hillary, why doesn't -- she made $250 million by being in office.	0
ClaimBuster	19670	Get people who don't have any interest in politics but understand the issue and let them make the recommendation to Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	19671	It was a very different George Bush who was talking much more sympathetically about the freeze in the spring of 1982 than he is today.	0
ClaimBuster	19672	If he'd let the inspectors do their job and go on, we wouldn't have 10 times the numbers of forces in Iraq that we have in Afghanistan chasing Osama bin Laden.	1
ClaimBuster	19673	I -- I hope so.	0
ClaimBuster	19674	But we also need well-equipped and well-trained and well-supported conventional forces.	0
ClaimBuster	19675	Milosevic's government refuses to release the vote count.	1
ClaimBuster	19676	The worst thing we could do in this economic climate is to raise people's taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	19677	The president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more -- if you will, trickle-down government -- would work.	1
ClaimBuster	19678	When you have 900 files gathered up by some guy who is a bouncer in a bar and hired a security officer to collect files, in Watergate -- I know a person who went to jail for looking at one file, one FBI file.	1
ClaimBuster	19679	I believe that in those cases where international custom calls for the expression of a regret, if that would have kept the summit going, in my judgment it was a proper action.	0
ClaimBuster	19680	I know we need to ban partial birth abortions.	0
ClaimBuster	19681	$30 billion, even cut funds for scholarships and college loans.	1
ClaimBuster	19682	I'm not sure I get -- help me with the question and I'll try to answer it.	0
ClaimBuster	19683	You'd exempt Social Security -- I don't want to tax or touch Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	19684	My opponent looked at the same intelligence I looked at and declared in 2002 that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat.	1
ClaimBuster	19685	At a very early age they learn how to learn.	0
ClaimBuster	19686	So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	19687	We will have the lower rate of inflation for the uh - calendar year this year - something slightly under 6 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	19688	I would be willing as president to meet with Mr. Khrushchev or any other world leader if it would serve the cause of peace.	0
ClaimBuster	19689	But there's no doubt that we're not going to be able to do everything that I think needs to be done.	0
ClaimBuster	19690	I was not the standard bearer.	1
ClaimBuster	19691	So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving.	0
ClaimBuster	19692	Those who suffered from discrimination because of race or sex certainly knew we had a racial problem.	0
ClaimBuster	19693	Believe it or not folks, you can't ship it all overseas, you've got to make it here.	0
ClaimBuster	19694	We're not going to have a draft so long as I am the president.	0
ClaimBuster	19695	For example, this Congress, very shortly, will spend a billion dollars a year for its housekeeping, its salaries, its expenses and the like.	0
ClaimBuster	19696	In addition to that, we've suffered because we haven't had leadership in this administration.	0
ClaimBuster	19697	I therefore suggest that in those basic commodities which are supported, that the federal government, after endorsement by the farmers in that commodity, attempt to bring supply and demand into balance - attempt effective production controls - so that we won't have that five or six per cent surplus which breaks the price fifteen or twenty per cent.	1
ClaimBuster	19698	We've got a government of stalemate.	0
ClaimBuster	19699	I've often heard President Eisenhower in discussing this question, make the statement that if we once start the process of indicating that this point or that point is not the place to stop those who threaten the peace and freedom of the world, where do we stop them?	1
ClaimBuster	19700	I believe that part of the reason we have a difficult situation is because we made a bad judgment going into Iraq in the first place when we hadn't finished the job of hunting down bin Laden and crushing al Qaeda.	0
ClaimBuster	19701	When I was in a rope line just the other day, coming out here from Wisconsin, a couple of young returnees were in the line, one active duty, one from the Guard.	1
ClaimBuster	19702	There is no doubt in my mind that in the downtown central cities, with the, with the new commitment on an energy policy, with a chance to revitalize homes and to make them more fuel efficient, with a chance for our synthetic fuels program, solar power, this will give us an additional opportunity for jobs which will pay rich dividends.	0
ClaimBuster	19703	And it focuses not only on increasing the supply, which I think we have to do, but also on working on the consumption side.	0
ClaimBuster	19704	And that's why I want to get the deficit down by controlling the growth of mandatory spending.	0
ClaimBuster	19705	And I'm saying to Barbara, you know, we've always kept family as a bit of an oasis for us.	0
ClaimBuster	19706	So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.	0
ClaimBuster	19707	We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election.	1
ClaimBuster	19708	She lied when she said she didn't call it the gold standard in one of the debates.	1
ClaimBuster	19709	But I think we should start by greatly expanding the so-called child health insurance or CHIP program to give health insurance to every single child in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	19710	The NIH is doing a good job in research.	0
ClaimBuster	19711	Certainly not right when it's happening.	0
ClaimBuster	19712	Sometimes they don't like the decisions made by America, but I don't think you want a president who tries to become popular and does the wrong thing.	0
ClaimBuster	19713	If you include Iran, our present shipment of weapons to the Middle East, only 20 percent goes to Israel.	1
ClaimBuster	19714	It is -- I'm not so sure 80% of the people get the death tax.	1
ClaimBuster	19715	That's key to the strength of our nation.	0
ClaimBuster	19716	...here's one thing I've learned as commander in chief.	0
ClaimBuster	19717	Right here in St. Louis, you've laid off 350 teachers.	1
ClaimBuster	19718	By cutting off trade, by cutting off our diplomatic relations as we have, we will quarantine this regime so that the people of Cuba themselves will take care of Mr. Castro.	1
ClaimBuster	19719	A lot of us are.	0
ClaimBuster	19720	And under my plan, in four years, as the percentage of our gross domestic product, federal spending will be the smallest that it has been in 50 years.	0
ClaimBuster	19721	I want to make sure we've got the best education system in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	19722	So 77 government programs, everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but weren't working very well, 18 government -- 18 government programs for education that were well-intentioned, not weren't helping kids learn, we went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars, $50 billion of waste taken out of the system.	1
ClaimBuster	19723	And the question in this election is: are we going to pass on that same American dream to the next generation?	0
ClaimBuster	19724	because you see China moving towards a free market economy.	1
ClaimBuster	19725	You must understand the region; you must understand the politics in the area; you must provide a strong alternative; and you must show strength -- and all at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	19726	We did it in my state, and we can do it nationally.	1
ClaimBuster	19727	I didn't want to give a slush fund to Halliburton.	0
ClaimBuster	19728	I hope and trust, in the best interest of both countries, and in the best interests of all people throughout this globe, that the Soviet Union and the United States can make a mutually beneficial agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	19729	Iran is at its weakest point, economically, strategically, militarily, then since -- then in many years.	1
ClaimBuster	19730	Does that mean that Saddam Hussein was 10 times more important than Osama bin Laden -- than, excuse me, Saddam Hussein more important than Osama bin Laden?	0
ClaimBuster	19731	Some of them I've got a conflict of interest on, if you know what I mean.	0
ClaimBuster	19732	We need to have transparency.	0
ClaimBuster	19733	Till you change it you're gonna be unhappy.	0
ClaimBuster	19734	Now, these are the conditions that I can lay out.	0
ClaimBuster	19735	It's important that we do that.	0
ClaimBuster	19736	That is something that every family that advocates on behalf of disabled children talk about.	0
ClaimBuster	19737	Every part of my program I've shown how I'm going to pay for it.	1
ClaimBuster	19738	We got the most expensive health care system in the world; it ranks behind 15 other nations when we come to life expectancy, and 22 other nations when we come to infant mortality.	1
ClaimBuster	19739	Here is what I believe, sir.	0
ClaimBuster	19740	My plan requires testing of all students.	0
ClaimBuster	19741	And I think what others could do for our country and themselves if we did the welfare reform thing in the proper way.	0
ClaimBuster	19742	And many of the public schools are meeting the call.	1
ClaimBuster	19743	The so-called Nixon shock against Japan had weakened our relationships there.	0
ClaimBuster	19744	You walk in, you put your little card in there.	0
ClaimBuster	19745	China should solve that problem for us.	0
ClaimBuster	19746	We canceled the B - 1 under the previous administration.	1
ClaimBuster	19747	Now we have the highest spending by Senator Obama's campaign than any time since Watergate.	1
ClaimBuster	19748	The -- first of all, I think Governor Romney was for an assault weapons ban before he was against it.	1
ClaimBuster	19749	I assume she had nothing to do with it.	0
ClaimBuster	19750	I'm sure you probably have heard that.	0
ClaimBuster	19751	... she's going to vote this November.	0
ClaimBuster	19752	People will look it up.	0
ClaimBuster	19753	But that's already the law and that doesn't help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions.	1
ClaimBuster	19754	This is the way it ought to work, give more power back to the states and back to the people back to the taxpayers, not always the long arm of the federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	19755	They've tried to undo them.	0
ClaimBuster	19756	I'll answer it straight to America.	0
ClaimBuster	19757	And I'm pretty good at it.	0
ClaimBuster	19758	In dealing with terrorists, yes, we want to retaliate, but only if we can put our finger on the people responsible and not endanger the lives of innocent civilians there in the various communities and in the city of Beirut where these terrorists are operating.	0
ClaimBuster	19759	As Senator Kennedy points out that as far as his one proposal is concerned - the one for medical care for the aged - that that would be financed out of Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	19760	They also have cut four billion dollars off of mutual security in these last six years.	1
ClaimBuster	19761	Uh - it seems to me that there should have - be an opportunity, uh - as long as it's voluntary, as long as there is no uh - compulsion whatsoever, that uh - an individual ought to have that right.	0
ClaimBuster	19762	And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	19763	And most of that tax cut went to the wealthiest people in the country.	1
ClaimBuster	19764	The last point I want to make on the issue of abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	19765	I don't know how to deal with it exactly.	0
ClaimBuster	19766	I questioned his judgment and his character.	1
ClaimBuster	19767	And if a crisis comes up, I ask who has the judgment and the experience and, yes, the character to make the right decision?	0
ClaimBuster	19768	And unless we're ready to carry out programs like that in the sixties, this battle for economic survival which these people are waging are going to be lost.	0
ClaimBuster	19769	The United States is a strong country.	0
ClaimBuster	19770	And so I'm proud of my choice.	0
ClaimBuster	19771	And we've got a robust research and development program that has been ongoing during my administration.	1
ClaimBuster	19772	You know, I've made some decisions on Israel that's unpopular.	1
ClaimBuster	19773	And number is to grow the economy, because if more people work in a growing economy, they're paying taxes, and you can get the job done that way.	0
ClaimBuster	19774	But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that -- because there is a problem.	0
ClaimBuster	19775	Barb and I lost a child, you know that we lost a daughter, Robin.	1
ClaimBuster	19776	As soon as we get the economy on a sound ground as well, I'd like to see the total repeal of indexing.	0
ClaimBuster	19777	You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders.	0
ClaimBuster	19778	These are they types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation, and I am opposed to that.	0
ClaimBuster	19779	She called it the gold standard.	1
ClaimBuster	19780	And the WIC program, and the school lunch program with senators like George McGovern, Hubert Humphrey and others, to name a few of my Democratic friends.	1
ClaimBuster	19781	And production on private -- on government land --	0
ClaimBuster	19782	Today, according to Prime Minister Rabin, the Soviet Union is weaker in the Middle East than they have been in many, many years.	1
ClaimBuster	19783	I think we're going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us.	0
ClaimBuster	19784	The private market and individual responsibility always work best.	1
ClaimBuster	19785	And incidentally, an excellent -- I mean, I think our success over the last eight years has not been in spite of diversity but because of it.	0
ClaimBuster	19786	As a matter of fact, uh - I've never advocated any cut of $15 billion in our defense budget.	1
ClaimBuster	19787	I see on the TV screens how hard it is.	0
ClaimBuster	19788	"In my faith tradition, it is -- it's written in the book of Matthew, ""Where your heart is, there is your treasure also."""	1
ClaimBuster	19789	We had to get their permission.	0
ClaimBuster	19790	Of course, the vice president is questioning my patriotism.	0
ClaimBuster	19791	Secondly, I did not criticize him for not calling for free elections.	0
ClaimBuster	19792	The American people will be called upon to tighten their belts a bit in meeting some of the problems that we face domestically.	0
ClaimBuster	19793	I would rather lose a campaign about decency than win a campaign about self-interest.	0
ClaimBuster	19794	I'd like to ask the American people what, what's been accomplished.	0
ClaimBuster	19795	And so the question is, who will safeguard this nation, who will safeguard our people and our children?	0
ClaimBuster	19796	And when you go through the process of registration, you in effect, are penalizing that individual who uses his gun for a very legitimate purpose.	0
ClaimBuster	19797	Almost every lawyer says, you don't release your returns until the audit's complete.	1
ClaimBuster	19798	Now, step one was a rescue package that was passed last week.	1
ClaimBuster	19799	His was what he's done to women.	0
ClaimBuster	19800	And as far as currency manipulation, the currency has actually gone up 11 percent since I've been president because we have pushed them hard.	1
ClaimBuster	19801	He said the Republican primary was rigged against him.	1
ClaimBuster	19802	Cheapest money you'll ever spend.	0
ClaimBuster	19803	The lesson was that in the aftermath of World War I, we kind of turned our backs and left them to their own devices and they brewed up a lot of trouble that quickly became World War II.	0
ClaimBuster	19804	They named him because of his votes.	1
ClaimBuster	19805	He points out that he would make pay-as-you-go be the basis for our natural resources development.	0
ClaimBuster	19806	That's the nature of the enemy, by the way.	0
ClaimBuster	19807	Well, I respect everything that the president has said and certainly respect his faith.	0
ClaimBuster	19808	And incidentally, one of them is this.	0
ClaimBuster	19809	And I want to help people in the middle-class.	0
ClaimBuster	19810	We're standing with you strong.	0
ClaimBuster	19811	But it can sure be made better.	0
ClaimBuster	19812	On the one hand, it's a good deal but on the other hand I'd make it better.	0
ClaimBuster	19813	That we ought to ... in addition to that, we ought to pay those retirement benefits on the basis of once a year, rather than twice a year, and save $750 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	19814	It's catastrophic in certain ways.	0
ClaimBuster	19815	Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal -- he's another real winner that you have -- and he's the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that.	1
ClaimBuster	19816	I'm for a massive reform of the estate tax or the death tax.	0
ClaimBuster	19817	They think the only way to do it is for the federal government to do it all.	0
ClaimBuster	19818	And because they didn't have a judicial intervention where she could go somewhere and get help, I voted against it.	1
ClaimBuster	19819	In regard to uh - price stability uh - I'm not aware that that committee did produce recommendations that ever were certainly before the Congress from the point of view of legislation in regard to controlling prices.	1
ClaimBuster	19820	I'm a product of it and I want to help that dream come true for every single citizen in this land, with a good job and good wages, with good schools in every part of this country and every community in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	19821	She trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career.	1
ClaimBuster	19822	Now why were we successful, as our predecessors were not successful?	0
ClaimBuster	19823	We have thumbprint, fingerprint technology today.	1
ClaimBuster	19824	Well, President, you're -- Mr. President, you're absolutely right, which is that, with regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not -- not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate, they're taxed at a lower rate.	1
ClaimBuster	19825	Don't have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have.	0
ClaimBuster	19826	I should have held out for a better deal that would have protected the taxpayer and not ended up doing what we had to do, or what I thought at the time would help.	0
ClaimBuster	19827	But we're going to give you additional choices like they give federal employees in the federal employee health plan.	0
ClaimBuster	19828	You see, we'll never be able to compete in the 21st century unless we have an education system that doesn't quit on children, an education system that raises standards, an education that makes sure there's excellence in every classroom.	0
ClaimBuster	19829	And then, on the floor of the Illinois State Senate, he voted present.	1
ClaimBuster	19830	And that clock is ticking.	0
ClaimBuster	19831	Senator Kennedy has indicated on several occasions in this program tonight that I have been misstating his record and his figures.	1
ClaimBuster	19832	The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn't work.	1
ClaimBuster	19833	But we get the job done.	0
ClaimBuster	19834	Now, I honor your service in World War II, I honor Mr. Perot's service in uniform and the service of every man and woman who ever served, including Admiral Crowe, who was your Chairman of the joint Chiefs and who's supporting me.	1
ClaimBuster	19835	I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah they are around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	19836	But I have a write-off, a lot of it's depreciation, which is a wonderful charge.	0
ClaimBuster	19837	I promise you I will keep mine.	0
ClaimBuster	19838	But the Saudi's and the Qatari, and -- and the Turks are all very concerned about this.	0
ClaimBuster	19839	And another one is: stimulate investment and savings.	0
ClaimBuster	19840	It's not the America that we have to have in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	19841	I mean, we're going to have kind of a nation building core from America?	0
ClaimBuster	19842	Ann, the Vice President made that pledge.	1
ClaimBuster	19843	I hope Mr. Ford doesn't either.	0
ClaimBuster	19844	I'll tell you what PAYGO means, when you're a senator from Massachusetts, when you're a colleague of Ted Kennedy, pay go means: You pay, and he goes ahead and spends.	0
ClaimBuster	19845	He said the centerpiece in my first four years is going to be a middle class tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	19846	I see a future when the world is at peace, with the United States of America promoting the values of democracy and human rights and freedom all around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	19847	I remember going down to Del Rio, Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	19848	It is only in that way that we can persevere.	0
ClaimBuster	19849	It's been looked, When I was chairman of the finance committee which handled Social Security we looked at all these options, and one thing we've got to make certain, when I used to go home my mother would tell me all I've got is my Social Security, don't touch it.	1
ClaimBuster	19850	But the joint chiefs say we're stronger and more confident and solid than ever.	1
ClaimBuster	19851	He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation.	1
ClaimBuster	19852	This is a matter of life and death.	0
ClaimBuster	19853	If he's serious about what he's saying, then the only place he can go to balance that budget is to raid the Social Security Trust Fund, and he tried that in 1985, and I think he's going to try it again.	1
ClaimBuster	19854	I've spelled out my position.	0
ClaimBuster	19855	They've never endorsed a presidential candidate.	1
ClaimBuster	19856	Trade grows about 12 percent year.	1
ClaimBuster	19857	So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people.	0
ClaimBuster	19858	And Mr. Bush is right - the two go hand in hand.	0
ClaimBuster	19859	If these young Americans don't have the skills that make them attractive to employees, they're not going to get jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	19860	I am looking to cut taxes for middle-income people.	0
ClaimBuster	19861	I worry about morale in today's military.	0
ClaimBuster	19862	And I have worked and I admire President Obama.	1
ClaimBuster	19863	Property crime is down 40 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	19864	The surge has been successful and the training program is proceeding apace.	1
ClaimBuster	19865	And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they're too good?	0
ClaimBuster	19866	I do it right at this time particularly because when we have Khrushchev in this country - a man who has enslaved millions, a man who has slaughtered thousands - we cannot continue to have a situation where he can point the finger at the United States of America and say that we are denying rights to our citizens.	1
ClaimBuster	19867	And first, he was going to dig a racetrack and have it going around in the racetrack so it would meet the requirements of SALT II treaty, and now he's decided it'll have a straight up and down thing, so it can he both verifiable and yet hideable from the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	19868	Well, look, Bob, as I said...	0
ClaimBuster	19869	We ought to be doing that.	0
ClaimBuster	19870	And it's my proposal, it's not Senator Obama's proposal, it's not President Bush's proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	19871	Number four, make sure we protect the integrity with the Medicare program and Medicaid program and not do anything in cutting costs which would cause hundreds of hospitals to close which could have been the case if the 270billion dollar Medicare cut that I vetoed, had been enacted in the law.	1
ClaimBuster	19872	And if we're going to find a permanent, fundamental answer to this, it goes to American economic and trade policies that permit these nations to have a chance to get on their own two feet and to get prosperity, so that they can have jobs for themselves and their people.	0
ClaimBuster	19873	All you have to do is speak to them.	0
ClaimBuster	19874	You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year '17, it is a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	19875	Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us.	0
ClaimBuster	19876	5000 students -- why is a high school that big?	0
ClaimBuster	19877	Which was a program under this administration, and how it worked exactly I think we don't know precisely, where thousands of automatic, and AK-47 type weapons were -- were given to people that ultimately gave them to -- to drug lords.	1
ClaimBuster	19878	And the vice president doesn't believe in exploration in Alaska.	1
ClaimBuster	19879	I would only suggest that while we do not take the credit for it - I would not presume to - that since that committee has been formed the price line has been held very well within the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	19880	The people have to make a choice between Mr. Nixon and myself, between the Republican party and the Democratic party, between our approach to the problems which now disturb us as a nation and disturb us as a world power.	0
ClaimBuster	19881	I don't want to --	0
ClaimBuster	19882	I don't mean to be critical of uh - Senator Mondale, but uh - I was uh - very, very surprised when I read that uh - Senator Mondale made a very derogatory, very personal comment about General Brown uh - after the news story that uh - broke about General Brown.	1
ClaimBuster	19883	See that the young people of America, particularly, have faith in the ideals of freedom and faith in God, which distinguishes us from the atheistic materialists who oppose us.	0
ClaimBuster	19884	Maybe I'm trying to save the money.	0
ClaimBuster	19885	I think that was a dereliction of duty.	0
ClaimBuster	19886	This is a great country, but I think it could be a greater country; and this is a powerful country, but I think it could be a more powerful country.	0
ClaimBuster	19887	Well, he'd rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us.	0
ClaimBuster	19888	If we fail, if we fail to move ahead, if we fail to develop sufficient military and economic and social strength here in this country, then I think that uh - the tide could begin to run against us.	0
ClaimBuster	19889	What does the President have to say about taking responsibility for a Vice President who won't apologize for something like that?	0
ClaimBuster	19890	And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw.	1
ClaimBuster	19891	Now, all of that can happen, but I have to ask you to do one thing: Join me in rolling back the president's unaffordable tax cut for people earning more than $200,000 a year.	0
ClaimBuster	19892	Started off as a humanitarian mission and it changed into a nation-building mission, and that's where the mission went wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	19893	It means seeing that our economy moves forward even faster than it has.	0
ClaimBuster	19894	Younger worker after younger worker hears my call that says I trust you.	1
ClaimBuster	19895	I won the Democratic nomination in fifty-one separate contests.	1
ClaimBuster	19896	I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate.	0
ClaimBuster	19897	And by working with all of the nations in the region -- unlike the policies of this administration and unlike the President said, they have not supported negotiations in that region -- we will be much stronger, because we'll have the moral authority that goes with those efforts.	1
ClaimBuster	19898	Discrimination ought to be punished but there ought to be equal opportunity.	0
ClaimBuster	19899	And I think that this uh - is one example where uh - a lot of people have selfish, grasping ideas now.	0
ClaimBuster	19900	So I know it can work; I've seen it happen.	0
ClaimBuster	19901	I chose Senator Walter Mondale.	1
ClaimBuster	19902	People are willing to take risks.	0
ClaimBuster	19903	I'm doing it because all my life I've fought for a system of justice in this country, a system in which every American has a chance to achieve the fullness in life without discrimination.	0
ClaimBuster	19904	And what about the mining of the harbors in Nicaragua which violated international law?	0
ClaimBuster	19905	To do what the Congress and Governor Clinton is suggesting, you'd isolate and ruin Hong Kong.	0
ClaimBuster	19906	All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years.	1
ClaimBuster	19907	And I subscribe completely to the spirit that Senator Kennedy has expressed tonight, the spirit that the United States should move ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	19908	He's done nothing about it.	1
ClaimBuster	19909	I need your support, I ask for your vote.	0
ClaimBuster	19910	He took his eye off the ball, off of Osama bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	19911	He can set up a fact-finding committee.	0
ClaimBuster	19912	You heard what I said about my tax plan.	1
ClaimBuster	19913	If we do that we start a chain reaction; because the Communists aren't after Quemoy and Matsu, they're a- they're after Formosa.	1
ClaimBuster	19914	Or do we want to go forward, marching together, as a nation of strength and that's going to continue to be strong?	0
ClaimBuster	19915	That's what we need more of, Candy.	0
ClaimBuster	19916	And they don't have the same capacities to attack the U.S. homeland and our allies as they did four years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	19917	I think the realities are that both Russia and China would probably pose significant obstacles.	0
ClaimBuster	19918	You have to be very careful of that because you have to protect the people who are already in the pipeline.	0
ClaimBuster	19919	"And so, when you say, ""There you go again'' -- people remember this, you know."	0
ClaimBuster	19920	In precinct politics in Texas and I've seen it at the national level.	0
ClaimBuster	19921	Because everybody's talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul.	1
ClaimBuster	19922	I'm pleased to be at the University of Denver, appreciate their welcome, and also the Presidential Commission on these debates.	0
ClaimBuster	19923	That's right at the middle class.	1
ClaimBuster	19924	We've got five-hundred thousand more Americans unemployed today than we had three months ago.	1
ClaimBuster	19925	I supported -- I supported that.	1
ClaimBuster	19926	Will a woman's right to choose be protected?	0
ClaimBuster	19927	The most recent figures, the last three months, on the third quarter of this year, the inflation rate is 7% - still too high, but it illustrates very vividly that in addition to providing an enormous number of jobs - nine million new jobs in the last three and a half years - that the inflationary threat is still urgent on us.	1
ClaimBuster	19928	Men's wages haven't gone up, gone down.	1
ClaimBuster	19929	Those issues you mentioned, Social Security, prescription drugs, the big drug companies are against the prescription drug proposal that I've made.	1
ClaimBuster	19930	We've got all kinds of giveaways.	0
ClaimBuster	19931	We need to have -- allow small businesses to write insurance across jurisdictional lines so small business can afford health care, small restaurants can afford health care.	0
ClaimBuster	19932	I believe that we could share more fully responsibilities for the Panama Canal Zone with Panama.	0
ClaimBuster	19933	What kind of message does it send to be sending money to open firehouses in Iraq, but we're shutting firehouses who are the first- responders here in America.	1
ClaimBuster	19934	He decides who the right people are.	1
ClaimBuster	19935	If we had done what Senator Obama wanted done in Iraq, and that was set a date for withdrawal, which General Petraeus, our chief -- chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff said would be a very dangerous course to take for America, then we would have had a wider war, we would have been back, Iranian influence would have increased, al Qaeda would have re- established a base.	0
ClaimBuster	19936	Well, the Social Security -- you're an expert and I could, I'm sure, learn from you the details of the Pension Guarantee Fund and the Social Security Fund.	0
ClaimBuster	19937	I proved that I will sign reasonable tort reform.	0
ClaimBuster	19938	So that'll stay the same.	0
ClaimBuster	19939	And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people.	0
ClaimBuster	19940	We need to shift very strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measures.	0
ClaimBuster	19941	And to maintain that peace requires strength.	0
ClaimBuster	19942	It was because they were too extreme.	0
ClaimBuster	19943	The president said he'd cut the deficit in half.	1
ClaimBuster	19944	And that's what's gonna happen in the State of Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	19945	He's man of solid judgment and he's going to be a person to stand by my side.	0
ClaimBuster	19946	But on the big questions, about whether or not we should have gone into Afghanistan, the big question about whether we should have removed somebody in Iraq, I'll stand by those decisions, because I think they're right.	0
ClaimBuster	19947	The S & L crisis was over, they're starting to sell assets, all that money was coming in.	1
ClaimBuster	19948	Horace Greeley said the only thing that endures is character.	1
ClaimBuster	19949	This has been one of the highest level operations in the whole State Department right under the President himself.	1
ClaimBuster	19950	"When you guard the oil ministry, but you don't guard the nuclear facilities, the message to a lot of people is maybe, ""Wow, maybe they're interested in our oil."""	0
ClaimBuster	19951	Secondly, across Texas, typically half of the school day was non-academic pursuits -- in one place it was 35%.	1
ClaimBuster	19952	The CDC, responsible for health in the United States, is setting those priorities and is allocating the flu vaccine accordingly.	1
ClaimBuster	19953	We need to open up markets.	0
ClaimBuster	19954	We, as I have said earlier, fell below the national average in inflation when we did that.	1
ClaimBuster	19955	And I believe the people who pay the bills ought to get some money back.	0
ClaimBuster	19956	John, you heard the president just say that he thought he might try to be for it.	1
ClaimBuster	19957	He's mentioned some ways to do it--and I agree with those.	0
ClaimBuster	19958	A woman came to me and she said, look, I can't afford insurance for myself or my son.	1
ClaimBuster	19959	They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them.	1
ClaimBuster	19960	Health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family.	1
ClaimBuster	19961	But we have got to instill values in these young people.	0
ClaimBuster	19962	The doctor chooses the prescription that you need and nobody can overrule your doctor.	1
ClaimBuster	19963	We're going to do it like you do it.	0
ClaimBuster	19964	I think that defense needs to be -- with fewer people in permanent armed services but with greater mobility on the land, in the air and on the sea, with a real dedication to continuing development of high technology weaponry and well trained people.	0
ClaimBuster	19965	And we need to stand with him.	0
ClaimBuster	19966	Secondly, there is other forms of racial profiling that goes on in America.	0
ClaimBuster	19967	But the front on this war is more than just one place.	0
ClaimBuster	19968	In other words, unless we're going to do it, then pick somebody who likes to talk about it.	0
ClaimBuster	19969	And that means being smart about allowing people to be fully educated, to know what their options are in life, and making certain that you don't deny a poor person the right to be able to have whatever the constitution affords them if they can't afford it otherwise.	0
ClaimBuster	19970	But let me just address what the president just said.	0
ClaimBuster	19971	Well, the AmeriCorps program, I must say, if that's one of your successes, I wouldn't speak about it too loudly.	0
ClaimBuster	19972	But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth.	1
ClaimBuster	19973	Mosul is on the border of Syria.	1
ClaimBuster	19974	So I think first and foremost our power ought to be wielded to in ways that form a more perfect union.	0
ClaimBuster	19975	And we have now achieved an historic arms control agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	19976	The average person wasn't benefitting.	1
ClaimBuster	19977	Well, let me start with Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	19978	We need to fully fund the act named for that wonderful boy Ryan White to make sure we're doing everything we can on research and treatment.	0
ClaimBuster	19979	There's nothing -- the most efficient unit of government the world will ever know is a strong loving family unit.	0
ClaimBuster	19980	And I won't comment on other things that happened in your administration or your past about drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	19981	After setting priorities, I want to give some of your money back.	0
ClaimBuster	19982	We are going to start the engine rolling again, because...	0
ClaimBuster	19983	All of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith.	0
ClaimBuster	19984	Well Mr. Drummond, first of all, referring to Secretary Dulles' press conference, I think if you read it all - and I know that you have - you will find that Secretary Dulles also indicated in that press conference that when the troops were withdrawn from Quemoy, that the implication was certainly of everything that he said, that Quemoy could better be defended.	1
ClaimBuster	19985	Now, why did they reject it?	0
ClaimBuster	19986	And that's the way I feel.	0
ClaimBuster	19987	Let me make sure you understand my decision.	0
ClaimBuster	19988	I'm going to help the Latinos, Hispanics.	0
ClaimBuster	19989	We'll have 125,000 troops trained by the end of this year.	1
ClaimBuster	19990	Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers' salaries?	0
ClaimBuster	19991	We told him he could take the northern part of Kuwait, and when he took the whole thing, we went nuts.	1
ClaimBuster	19992	I suspect we won't agree here tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	19993	When I asked Yassir Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu to come to Washington and got them together and they talked alone for three hours, I was convinced that they had to have a chance to make that peace.	1
ClaimBuster	19994	Ladies and gentlemen, the right war was Osama bin Laden and Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	19995	And if I can't make a great deal -- then we're going to terminate NAFTA and we're going to create new deals.	0
ClaimBuster	19996	Did you approve of his diplomatic activity?	0
ClaimBuster	19997	Well, I'd like to go back just one moment to the previous question, where uh - Mr. Ford, I think, confused the issue by trying to say that we are shipping Israel 40 percent of our aid.	0
ClaimBuster	19998	The point -- the point is -- the point is, we need to examine every agency of government.	0
ClaimBuster	19999	And with regard to friendship below the border and with the countries down there, yes, no administration that I know has established the relationship that we have with our Latin friends.	0
ClaimBuster	20000	Let's get that straight right away.	0
ClaimBuster	20001	You ought to go out and see around this country what's happening in the volunteer section: Americans helping America.	0
ClaimBuster	20002	I know what it takes to get this to happen, and my plan will do that, and one part of it is to make sure that we keep China playing by the rules.	0
ClaimBuster	20003	I would hope that from this point on, we get to the issues that affect the vast majority of Americans, jobs, schools, health care, housing, the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	20004	A report on international terrorism chaired by the Vice President was released and made some very specific recommendations about how to deal with terrorism.	1
ClaimBuster	20005	And the result is exactly what we see.	0
ClaimBuster	20006	Now, the tax relief that I propose is directed specifically at middle-income individuals and families.	1
ClaimBuster	20007	Mixed messages send the wrong signals to the Iraqi citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	20008	I vote against them, my friends.	0
ClaimBuster	20009	It would be squandered, too, believe me.	0
ClaimBuster	20010	I will see that these standards apply to the United States Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	20011	Wasn't a top-down approach, Governor.	0
ClaimBuster	20012	Instead let people make their own choice.	0
ClaimBuster	20013	These are people that give of themselves everyday and every week and every month.	0
ClaimBuster	20014	I invited the former prime minister of Russia to my house and took a risk in asking him to get personally involved, along with the head of Finland, to go to Belgrade and to take a set of proposals from the United States that would constitute basically a surrender by Serbia.	1
ClaimBuster	20015	You have a U.S. attorney here that sends `em back home, so I think that's pretty important.	1
ClaimBuster	20016	It also exists among minority groups.	1
ClaimBuster	20017	(Laughter and applause) But--but--see, let me make it very clear.	0
ClaimBuster	20018	And 100 percent, John, of your ads -- 100 percent of them have been negative.	1
ClaimBuster	20019	Sometimes the views have been distorted.	0
ClaimBuster	20020	I want to see - when I talked at our convention about a thousand points of light, I was talking about the enormous numbers of shelters and organizations that help.	0
ClaimBuster	20021	The last point I'll make about small businesses.	0
ClaimBuster	20022	They say we should be satisfied.	0
ClaimBuster	20023	Let's look at our records, my friends, and then listen to my vision for the future of America.	0
ClaimBuster	20024	And let's give him the credit he deserves for organizing Operation Desert Storm and Desert Shield.	1
ClaimBuster	20025	(LAUGHTER) I -- there's an old high school debating trick, which is to answer something and then attack your opponent at the end.	0
ClaimBuster	20026	The mines are closed down; there are 22000 miners out of work.	1
ClaimBuster	20027	In the 1990s, I went to Beijing and I said women's rights are human rights.	1
ClaimBuster	20028	Along with this, I think we need something else that has been allowed to deteriorate.	0
ClaimBuster	20029	When they sell into us, there's no tax.	1
ClaimBuster	20030	I want it to be clearer.	0
ClaimBuster	20031	And we have a vacancy.	1
ClaimBuster	20032	And I will succeed for those troops, now that we're there.	0
ClaimBuster	20033	"Now when Senator Green, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to the President, he received back on the second of October, 1958 - ""neither you nor any other American need feel the U.S. will be involved in military hostilities merely in the defense of Quemoy and Matsu."""	1
ClaimBuster	20034	Those are the kind of judges I will appoint.	0
ClaimBuster	20035	It's been a good instinct.	0
ClaimBuster	20036	I don't think it's a fair price to pay to destroy precious parts of America's environment.	0
ClaimBuster	20037	All our Arab allies out there thought we ought to do just exactly that.	0
ClaimBuster	20038	Now General Petraeus has praised the successes, but he said those successes are fragile and if we set a specific date for withdrawal -- and by the way, Senator Obama's original plan, they would have been out last spring before the surge ever had a chance to succeed.	1
ClaimBuster	20039	If you take a trillion dollars out of that Social Security Trust Fund, how are the checks going to be -- how are you going to keep faith with the seniors?	0
ClaimBuster	20040	Most people that are lobbying are lobbying the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	20041	What's in the best interests of our people?	0
ClaimBuster	20042	It isn't the few people who live on them - they are not too important.	0
ClaimBuster	20043	And so I think you take a look at it.	0
ClaimBuster	20044	I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	20045	Secondly, whether or not the mission was clear.	0
ClaimBuster	20046	Now they have the bombs and we're less safe.	1
ClaimBuster	20047	I don't fault the President or the vice president for sending their children to private schools or better schools.	0
ClaimBuster	20048	This ultimate terrorist threat is the most fearsome of all, and it's part of a pattern where our country must stand firm to control terrorism of all kinds.	0
ClaimBuster	20049	Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about.	1
ClaimBuster	20050	I accompanied James Lee Witt down to Texas when those fires broke out.	1
ClaimBuster	20051	And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially.	0
ClaimBuster	20052	Appreciate the chance to have a good, honest dialogue about our differences of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	20053	In California - I'm surprised Governor Reagan brought this up - he had the three largest tax increases in the history of that state under his administration.	1
ClaimBuster	20054	What Senator McCain refers to is a measure in the Senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	20055	Now, they're the 2 folks involved so maybe if you put them together, they did it.	0
ClaimBuster	20056	I believe that the question oversimplifies the difficulties of what we must do in Central America.	0
ClaimBuster	20057	Governor Romney not only opposed it, he suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.	1
ClaimBuster	20058	And it was because they did not think through how power should be exercised, did not have the American public with them on a plan that worked, that we ended up the way we did.	0
ClaimBuster	20059	Well, actually Governor, that isn't what your plan does.	0
ClaimBuster	20060	You ask when do you decide to deploy them.	0
ClaimBuster	20061	I'll tell you how it's affected me.	0
ClaimBuster	20062	Yes, we're going to have a strong and credible and effective nuclear deterrent.	0
ClaimBuster	20063	I wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community where everybody has a role to play.	0
ClaimBuster	20064	But there's got to be priorities, and Middle East is a priority for a lot of reasons, as is Europe and the Far East, our own hemisphere.	0
ClaimBuster	20065	Testing should be confidential, but we have to have a knowledge.	0
ClaimBuster	20066	And what we've seen over the last four years is something I don't want to see over the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	20067	We've got a long tradition of hunting and sportsmen and people who want to make sure they can protect themselves.	1
ClaimBuster	20068	Tipper and I have worked on the problem of violence in entertainment aimed at children.	1
ClaimBuster	20069	But the challenge is to know when the United States of American can beneficially effect the outcome of a crisis, when to go in and when not, when American military power is worth the expenditure of our most precious treasure.	0
ClaimBuster	20070	If a Negro baby is born - and this is true also of Puerto Ricans and Mexicans in some of our cities - he has about one-half as much chance to get through high school as a white baby.	1
ClaimBuster	20071	You can't solve a problem unless you diagnose it.	0
ClaimBuster	20072	It's not working for the American family.	0
ClaimBuster	20073	And I've -- and we've always said that that's not appropriate.	0
ClaimBuster	20074	We do not help it.	0
ClaimBuster	20075	I think we can bring it down by 50% in 4 years and grow the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	20076	I'd like the American people to know that I have worked very hard to be on their side.	0
ClaimBuster	20077	But I can't foresee all the things that will happen, and I don't think a president should be judged solely on the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	20078	You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund.	1
ClaimBuster	20079	But why not do what I have offered to do and asked the Soviet Union to do?	0
ClaimBuster	20080	I said that his tax cut plan, for example, raises the question of whether it's the right choice for the country.	0
ClaimBuster	20081	Second, we have to face that in this world, economic security is a whole lot of national security.	0
ClaimBuster	20082	And I don't think they would have supported the uh - bill had they known that they would lose a hundred and forty thousand jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	20083	In addition, the jobs would not be available right now.	1
ClaimBuster	20084	We're not going to follow that path while I'm -- when I'm president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	20085	A minute ago the President quoted Cicero, I believe.	1
ClaimBuster	20086	In other words, if you're a mom and you're pregnant and you get killed, the murderer gets tried for two cases, not just one.	1
ClaimBuster	20087	I think -- I think -- I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate.	0
ClaimBuster	20088	In addition, Republican Congress cut $53 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	20089	I'd say, Bob, I've got policies to continue to grow our economy and create the jobs of the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	20090	Well we need, for example, economic assistance; we need technical assistance; we need exchange; we need programs of diplomatic and other character which will be effective in that area.	0
ClaimBuster	20091	That's why we have to move forward and not go back.	0
ClaimBuster	20092	Free nations will help us achieve the peace we all want.	0
ClaimBuster	20093	If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country.	0
ClaimBuster	20094	But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said...	1
ClaimBuster	20095	I hope it will not be necessary for any power to resume uh - testing in the atmosphere.	0
ClaimBuster	20096	These have been priorities of mine since I got to the Senate, and it is absolutely critical that we develop a high fuel efficient car that's built not in Japan and not in South Korea, but built here in the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	20097	I don't want my ten year old grandchild to go into an X-rated movie.	0
ClaimBuster	20098	And that's what I would say to that person.	0
ClaimBuster	20099	Well, I don't believe in command and control out of Washington, D.C.	0
ClaimBuster	20100	Knowing what the size of the deficit was, knowing there was no plan to control health care costs and knowing that we did not have a strategy to get real economic growth back into this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	20101	Do you really think that our armed forces are really acceptably strong in those areas of conventional capability where they should be?	0
ClaimBuster	20102	And I don't think that that should be a part of political dialog.	0
ClaimBuster	20103	This requires a person who understands what our -- the limits of our capability are.	0
ClaimBuster	20104	That's why they're fighting so vociferously.	0
ClaimBuster	20105	Let me tell you something.	0
ClaimBuster	20106	And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants.	1
ClaimBuster	20107	A supporter of Senator Obama's is Warren Buffett.	1
ClaimBuster	20108	I just had a word of clarification because of something Governor Clinton said.	0
ClaimBuster	20109	We're 9 million jobs short of that.	1
ClaimBuster	20110	First, we have to learn from the past, because we cannot afford to make the mistakes of the past.	0
ClaimBuster	20111	And I think then you're going to see that people are put out of work.	0
ClaimBuster	20112	Permit the president to set the priorities on where we do the spending.	0
ClaimBuster	20113	That's the only way we got him back.	0
ClaimBuster	20114	You've got to say what you're for and you've got to --	0
ClaimBuster	20115	I think that in dealing with the Soviet Union one has to be realistic.	0
ClaimBuster	20116	I believe that any law- abiding, tax-paying citizen who shows up in the morning and doesn't break the law and doesn't interfere with his or her neighbors ought to have the ability to work in our country and shouldn't be subject to unfair discrimination.	0
ClaimBuster	20117	He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	20118	For me, this is about jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	20119	And secondly, I repeat to you --	0
ClaimBuster	20120	But what we can't do is to simply suggest that, as Governor Romney at times has suggested, that giving heavy weapons, for example, to the Syrian opposition is a simple proposition that would lead us to be safer over the long term.	1
ClaimBuster	20121	But that's not what you've done in the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	20122	Now the oil industry recently has had hard times.	0
ClaimBuster	20123	I will bring -- excuse me.	0
ClaimBuster	20124	We have believed in partnership, and that was an example of a partnership between, not only local government and the Federal Government but also between the private sector that built that particular structure.	0
ClaimBuster	20125	Let me also note that the greatest threat that the world faces, the greatest national security threat is a nuclear Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	20126	Both I and all my predecessors have had a deep commitment to controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	20127	The answer was we got...	0
ClaimBuster	20128	there must by K-2 diagnostic teaching tools, teacher training money, available.	0
ClaimBuster	20129	If you believe that the California economy was better in 1992 than it is today, you should vote for Bob Dole.	1
ClaimBuster	20130	We have uh - just advocated uh - this past week a consolidation of the responsibilities for energy.	1
ClaimBuster	20131	Well, everybody's nibbling around the edges.	0
ClaimBuster	20132	I want to make sure our take-home pay turns around and starts to grow.	0
ClaimBuster	20133	The trick is to expand our export base and to expand trade on terms that are fair to us.	0
ClaimBuster	20134	A commitment to grow the economy while protecting the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	20135	And local school districts end up having more of a burden, a bunch of unfunded mandates, the same kind of thing that happened with special education where we did the right thing by saying every school should provide education to kids with special needs, but we never followed through on the promise of funding, and that left local school districts very cash-strapped.	1
ClaimBuster	20136	I think the lesson in Central America, this recent embarrassment in Nicaragua where we are giving instructions for hired assassins, hiring criminals, and the rest -- all of this has strengthened our opponents.	1
ClaimBuster	20137	They're doing it all over America because they have to.	1
ClaimBuster	20138	Maybe that's why he's asked for 860 -- sought and proposed $860 billion worth of new spending and wants to raise people's taxes in a time of incredible challenge and difficulty and heartache for the American families.	1
ClaimBuster	20139	Now, we have tried -- our country has tried to create an Africa crisis response team there, and we've met some resistance.	1
ClaimBuster	20140	Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction.	0
ClaimBuster	20141	I said that wasn't the right thing to do.	1
ClaimBuster	20142	I'll make sure we can reform Medicare and Social Security to preserve them for coming -- coming generations.	0
ClaimBuster	20143	And it's a tremendously successful club.	0
ClaimBuster	20144	That is a fundamental difference that I have with Senator McCain.	0
ClaimBuster	20145	Once the uh - search and analysis procedure had been completed, and once I'm given a list of the five or seven or ten uh - best qualified persons in the country, I would make a selection from among those uh - persons.	0
ClaimBuster	20146	You're almost not old enough to remember this.	0
ClaimBuster	20147	And we are going to have to intervene; there's no doubt about that.	0
ClaimBuster	20148	Well, we can do better than that.	0
ClaimBuster	20149	Then when there were dissidents in the streets of Tehran, a Green Revolution, holding signs saying, is America with us, the president was silent.	1
ClaimBuster	20150	The first half of '84 it's up 81/2 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	20151	And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people.	1
ClaimBuster	20152	That's the way the system works.	0
ClaimBuster	20153	So I'm not exactly sure where the vice president is coming from, but I think one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly American is for us to go around the world saying, Ã¢â‚¬Å“we do it this way, so should you.Ã¢â‚¬Â Now, we trust freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	20154	He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable.	0
ClaimBuster	20155	And they all say to me that we don't want defeat.	0
ClaimBuster	20156	And people all find their ways to express it.	0
ClaimBuster	20157	And their idea was that they knew what was best for the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	20158	My definition -- here's what I can tell the American people: 95 percent of you will get a tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	20159	And we're going lower, in my opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	20160	Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it.	0
ClaimBuster	20161	"So for instance when he says, ""Yours is a $5 trillion cut."""	1
ClaimBuster	20162	My parents came to this country as immigrants.	1
ClaimBuster	20163	Nobody in the world agrees with our policy on Cuba now.	0
ClaimBuster	20164	But you don't have to wonder if it's me talking.	0
ClaimBuster	20165	The government has nothing to do with it.	0
ClaimBuster	20166	As a matter of reality, Fm going to have to because we have had not one but two detailed studies which indicate that there are billions and billions of dollars to be collected that are not being paid these are not taxes owed by average Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	20167	Well, first of all, Jim, I would like to respond to what the governor just said.	0
ClaimBuster	20168	I love my grandchildren --	0
ClaimBuster	20169	But because Arab nations and the Israelis trust the United States, we were able to take the lead in the Sinai II Agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	20170	I just want to make sure that --	0
ClaimBuster	20171	I just want to make sure the return is good.	0
ClaimBuster	20172	And I think now that trust is being violated and it seems to me we ought to face up to it, and the president ought to say tonight that he's not going to pardon anybody that he was involved in business with who might implicate him later on.	0
ClaimBuster	20173	And you can take it out on charts, you look at all the studies the different groups have done, you go out 4, 5, 6 years, we're still drifting along with a huge deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	20174	It's a haven for drug smugglers and we don't have a firm policy when it comes to Fidel Castro.	1
ClaimBuster	20175	I have fought for reform.	1
ClaimBuster	20176	She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever.	0
ClaimBuster	20177	We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.	1
ClaimBuster	20178	The debt and the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	20179	But I thought it would cost a lot -- I think there's a better way to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	20180	And I do resort to prayer.	0
ClaimBuster	20181	We've got this country going in the right direction.	0
ClaimBuster	20182	There is only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom - that that is presented by the international Communist movement.	0
ClaimBuster	20183	And I know what many of them say today, and I know how to bring them back to the table.	0
ClaimBuster	20184	I supported strong action against the tobacco companies to stop the marketing, advertising, and sale of tobacco to young people.	1
ClaimBuster	20185	Now, put together your plans by Christmas, be ready to go when Congress goes, nail these things.	0
ClaimBuster	20186	And for the state to interfere with a Constitutional amendment, and tell a woman that she must carry that pregnancy to term, regardless of her personal belief, that, I think, violates freedom of conscience as much as anything that I can think of.	0
ClaimBuster	20187	It will require some funds, John.	0
ClaimBuster	20188	We have thousands, equivalent of megaton, or million tons, of TNT warheads.	1
ClaimBuster	20189	The only attacks I have made are on people who apparently would break away at that wall from the government side, using the government, using the power of the courts and so forth to hinder that part of the Constitution that says the government shall not only not establish a religion, it shall not inhibit the practice of religion.	1
ClaimBuster	20190	I read his statement the other day.	1
ClaimBuster	20191	That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.	0
ClaimBuster	20192	So I think the tone of this campaign could have been very different.	0
ClaimBuster	20193	He vetoed middle class tax relief this year.	1
ClaimBuster	20194	First of all, what my opponent wants you to forget is that he voted to authorize the use of force and now says it's the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place.	1
ClaimBuster	20195	We're going to have to have a president, however, that doesn't think that somehow the government investing in -- in car companies like Tesla and -- and Fisker, making electric battery cars.	0
ClaimBuster	20196	And I've told everything I know about it.	0
ClaimBuster	20197	He wanted to take them into bankruptcy without providing them any way to stay open.	0
ClaimBuster	20198	We went because there were people who were responsible for 3,000 American deaths.	1
ClaimBuster	20199	So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead.	1
ClaimBuster	20200	I'll catch up with it later.	0
ClaimBuster	20201	Iran continued to sell oil to the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	20202	And I truly respect it.	0
ClaimBuster	20203	And I want to fight for them.	0
ClaimBuster	20204	We're going to pass a million bankruptcies this year for the first time in history.	1
ClaimBuster	20205	If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.	0
ClaimBuster	20206	You've got more money in your pocket as a result of the tax relief we passed and he opposed.	1
ClaimBuster	20207	Well, I don't have any quarrel with that.	0
ClaimBuster	20208	We've been for that for four, five, six years.	1
ClaimBuster	20209	It's important for the success of Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	20210	When we terminated 400,000 desperate, hopeless, defenseless Americans who were on disability -- confused and unable to defend themselves, and just laid them out on the street, as we did for 4 years, I don't think that's what America is all about.	1
ClaimBuster	20211	The president has denied 9.2 million women $3,800 a year, but he doesn't hesitate to fight for $136,000 to a millionaire.	1
ClaimBuster	20212	I love the principle it's founded on.	0
ClaimBuster	20213	He's broken the pay-as-you-go rules.	0
ClaimBuster	20214	Most important good things that happen in America happen in families.	0
ClaimBuster	20215	In Africa we did not.	1
ClaimBuster	20216	And they are the people who ought to go behind bars.	0
ClaimBuster	20217	In addition to that, we just passed a sweeping small business reform that makes it easier for small business people to take out 401 K plans for themselves and employees and much easier for employees to carry it from job to job.	1
ClaimBuster	20218	I also - know that as far as the human beings on this earth are concerned that the nonproliferation of atomic weapons is number one.	0
ClaimBuster	20219	That's why I'm the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out.	1
ClaimBuster	20220	I'm going to keep my word to you.	0
ClaimBuster	20221	Where did you find this?	0
ClaimBuster	20222	But there's going to be a new Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	20223	We've made real progress there.	0
ClaimBuster	20224	The warning signs are real.	0
ClaimBuster	20225	If Iran acquires nuclear weapons, all the other countries will acquire them, too.	0
ClaimBuster	20226	But when I proposed my plan this past Tuesday, he or one of his spokesmen called it socialized medicine.	1
ClaimBuster	20227	I don't want to walk away from them.	0
ClaimBuster	20228	I have no hesitancy in saying so.	0
ClaimBuster	20229	So we've got to deal with that right away.	0
ClaimBuster	20230	I will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations.	0
ClaimBuster	20231	I think we need to have rating systems that are clear.	0
ClaimBuster	20232	That means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil -- 25 percent of the world's oil -- have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with Russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states we've talked about, Iran, Venezuela.	1
ClaimBuster	20233	But we can't be all things to all people in the world, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	20234	There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression.	0
ClaimBuster	20235	My administration started what's called the Proliferation Security Initiative.	1
ClaimBuster	20236	Less regulations if we want jobs here; legal reform if we want jobs here; and we've got to keep taxes low.	0
ClaimBuster	20237	But, if we're talking about how much we think about the working people and so forth, I'm the only fellow who ever ran for this job who was six times President of his own union and still has a lifetime membership in that union.	1
ClaimBuster	20238	Here's what I do: We take over Medicaid children from the states so that every child in America is covered.	0
ClaimBuster	20239	People are all over the country.	1
ClaimBuster	20240	And your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	20241	And we have to also be very cautious in the way we use our military.	0
ClaimBuster	20242	"People grabbed my arms and said, ""Please save my job."""	1
ClaimBuster	20243	Thank you all very much.	0
ClaimBuster	20244	You've got to have a clear vision.	0
ClaimBuster	20245	In 1983 we thought we had a 75 -year fix.	1
ClaimBuster	20246	But when it comes to our national security, I mean what I say.	0
ClaimBuster	20247	There are 168 federal programs that allow quotas.	1
ClaimBuster	20248	I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system.	1
ClaimBuster	20249	There has never been anything like it, and we're going to have a special prosecutor.	0
ClaimBuster	20250	We have seen the barricades that have had to be built around the White House.	1
ClaimBuster	20251	So we don't have the best.	0
ClaimBuster	20252	That conference has met six times.	1
ClaimBuster	20253	Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	20254	And people were able to stay in their homes, and eventually the values of those homes went up, and they actually made money.	1
ClaimBuster	20255	Let's lay down some guidelines so we don't have continuing inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	20256	It's also a curious thing for him to say since right after 1993 he voted to cut the intelligence budget by $7.5 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	20257	We have been wholly indifferent to Latin America until the last few months.	0
ClaimBuster	20258	You see, I don't think the American people are taxed too little.	0
ClaimBuster	20259	That, once again, the printing presses will start to roll; once again we will see the monetization of that debt result in a higher rate of inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	20260	The Taliban came back in, Al Qaida, we then had the situation that required us to conduct the Afghan war.	1
ClaimBuster	20261	And I expect to win.	0
ClaimBuster	20262	If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	20263	The analysis that he's talking about leaves out more than half of the tax cuts that I have proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	20264	And it seems to me that this could be an adjunct, or certainly a great assisting agent in getting that done.	0
ClaimBuster	20265	Let me talk to the workers.	0
ClaimBuster	20266	But what I've also said is, if we're serious about reducing the deficit, if this is genuinely a moral obligation to the next generation, then in addition to some tough spending cuts, we've also got to make sure that the wealthy do a little bit more.	0
ClaimBuster	20267	In fact, just today business organizations like the United States Chamber of Commerce, which generally are pretty supportive of Republicans, said that this would lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system.	1
ClaimBuster	20268	Non-homeland, non-defense discretionary spending was raising at 15 percent a year when I got into office.	1
ClaimBuster	20269	I'm afraid Senator Obama doesn't understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	20270	Mr. Reagan, as you saw tonight -- President Reagan takes the position it will disappear by magic.	0
ClaimBuster	20271	have leased only 2% of the possible.	1
ClaimBuster	20272	Let's have a three-day waiting period, cooling off, so we can have a background check to make sure that criminals and people who really shouldn't have guns don't get them.	0
ClaimBuster	20273	Well, I'd say the first homeless bill in the Senate was the Dole-Byrd Byrd-Dole bill, I can't remember who was in control then.	1
ClaimBuster	20274	The governor has described Medicare as a government HMO.	1
ClaimBuster	20275	We feel that uh - with the programs that I have recommended, the additional $10 billion tax cut, with the moderate increases in the quality-of-life area, we can still have a balanced budget which I will submit to the Congress in January of 1978.	0
ClaimBuster	20276	You've got a $260 billion deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	20277	And I was in the state senate and I was governor and I'm an engineer, a Naval officer, a farmer, a businessman.	1
ClaimBuster	20278	The other point that I would make is this: this downgrading of how much things cost I think many of our people will understand better when they look at what happened when - during the Truman Administration when the government was spending more than it took in - we found savings over a lifetime eaten up by inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	20279	I've supported all the education programs.	1
ClaimBuster	20280	It comes right out of your paycheck.	1
ClaimBuster	20281	If we're a humble nation, but strong, they'll welcome us.	0
ClaimBuster	20282	Contrary to what Senator McCain keeps on saying, I favor nuclear power as one component of our overall energy mix.	1
ClaimBuster	20283	There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.	1
ClaimBuster	20284	And I've said that I'm going to keep this Social Security entitlement, to keep that trust fund sound.	1
ClaimBuster	20285	As far as I'm concerned, this is a campaign about issues.	0
ClaimBuster	20286	And the amount of debt we're adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral.	1
ClaimBuster	20287	I think we will have a continuing responsibility, as the only remaining superpower, to stay involved.	0
ClaimBuster	20288	You and Mr. Mondale have already disagreed about what you had to say about recalling submarine-launched missiles.	1
ClaimBuster	20289	Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans?	0
ClaimBuster	20290	And we can't do that.	0
ClaimBuster	20291	Senator McCain is absolutely right, we cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	20292	They will be protecting the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	20293	Now he can't have it both ways.	0
ClaimBuster	20294	And one way to do it is to get these deadbeat fathers to pay their obligations to these mothers -- that will help strengthen the American family.	0
ClaimBuster	20295	We have to remain vigilant, as I just said.	0
ClaimBuster	20296	Look at the 24 generals and admirals, retired, that have endorsed me, including the deputy commander of Desert Storm.	1
ClaimBuster	20297	Put everybody that's breathing to work.	0
ClaimBuster	20298	But he's promised seniors that their Social Security benefits will not be cut, and he's promised the same trillion dollars to them.	1
ClaimBuster	20299	I've spoken out over and over again against antisemitism and racism, and I think my record as a member of Congress speaks for itself on that.	1
ClaimBuster	20300	So where'd the increase come from?	0
ClaimBuster	20301	So, Social Security has nothing to do with balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	20302	But I am not going to shortchange our troops in harm's way.	0
ClaimBuster	20303	Then the president, in fact, promised them.	1
ClaimBuster	20304	People are going to come in from Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	20305	It's something to build on.	0
ClaimBuster	20306	Fortunately, a democracy took over, but this nation was embarrassed by this current administration's adoption of their policies.	0
ClaimBuster	20307	And if we haven't learned from the negotiating history on that, we'll never learn.	0
ClaimBuster	20308	Now, in 1984 they were told.	1
ClaimBuster	20309	But you heard the president just say to you that we've added money.	1
ClaimBuster	20310	America is great, because America is good.	0
ClaimBuster	20311	So, I feel in that case, as well as in the reorganization of the intelligence agencies, as I've done, we have to do it by executive order.	0
ClaimBuster	20312	In 6 years -- I budget all this in my budget, and in 6 years the college program would cost 8 billion dollars over and above what -- the present student loan program costs 4; you pay 3 billion dollars for busted loans, because we don't have an automatic recovery system, and a billion dollars in bank fees.	1
ClaimBuster	20313	It's about what the 21st century is going to be like for you.	0
ClaimBuster	20314	When I was a young man, I volunteered for the Army.	1
ClaimBuster	20315	She had one of the greatest lines of all lines.	0
ClaimBuster	20316	And let's not raise anybody's taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	20317	Well, Andrea, today we have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads, on land, on air and in the sea.	1
ClaimBuster	20318	Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens.	1
ClaimBuster	20319	And that one doesn't sound good and it's not affordable.	0
ClaimBuster	20320	Maybe you think that makes sense.	0
ClaimBuster	20321	And I've tried to do that in public life, all through it.	1
ClaimBuster	20322	Look, one murder is too many.	0
ClaimBuster	20323	And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that?	0
ClaimBuster	20324	It is tragic that uh - the full transcript of that interview was not released and that there were excerpts, some of the excerpts, taken out of context.	1
ClaimBuster	20325	And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where we're counting slips.	0
ClaimBuster	20326	I've seen what it is like to see a war, to see the burdens of a war, and I don't want to see us make reckless cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	20327	He wanted to give people rights.	0
ClaimBuster	20328	The first two weeks she's got them, some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned.	1
ClaimBuster	20329	Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, the Baltics are free.	1
ClaimBuster	20330	And we're going to have to embrace a culture and an ethic of responsibility, all of us, corporations, the federal government, and individuals out there who may be living beyond their means.	0
ClaimBuster	20331	But it's getting worse by the day.	0
ClaimBuster	20332	We need more troops there.	0
ClaimBuster	20333	His record in the United States Senate does not match his rhetoric.	1
ClaimBuster	20334	I'm not going to do that, because I think the jury is still out on the Soviet experiment.	0
ClaimBuster	20335	More so you than me.	0
ClaimBuster	20336	Thank you for your question.	0
ClaimBuster	20337	I built an unbelievable company.	1
ClaimBuster	20338	They don't happen to be accurate.	0
ClaimBuster	20339	The American people can make up their mind about whether that's a liberal record or a record that's good for America.	0
ClaimBuster	20340	And she worked her way up to become a vice president of a local bank, but she hit the glass ceiling.	1
ClaimBuster	20341	But I do not expect it to come.	0
ClaimBuster	20342	But next door, of course, we have Egypt.	1
ClaimBuster	20343	Of course, we don't have Medicare, but we didn't cut Medicare by $716 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	20344	You know, because of the intelligence coordination that we do with a range of countries, including Israel, we have a sense of when they would get breakout capacity, which means that we would not be able to intervene in time to stop their nuclear program.	1
ClaimBuster	20345	Nobody ever told the American people that we increased spending $1.83 for every dollar of taxes raised.	1
ClaimBuster	20346	I have met with the President when he made the great decisions with regard to Lebanon, Quemoy and Matsu, other matters.	1
ClaimBuster	20347	I voted for IRA tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	20348	You just say: Hey, we don't agree with you.	0
ClaimBuster	20349	Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values?	0
ClaimBuster	20350	And -- and that upset them, but obviously there was a great deal of anger even before that.	0
ClaimBuster	20351	So my plan -- we're going to renegotiate trade deals.	0
ClaimBuster	20352	Then Cuba shot down two of our planes and murdered four people in international air space.	1
ClaimBuster	20353	I should also point out this; once you put the responsibility on the federal government for paying a portion of teachers' salaries, your local communities and your states are not going to meet the responsibility as much as they should.	0
ClaimBuster	20354	Now again, the White House is a bully pulpit.	0
ClaimBuster	20355	No, and they don't have to, providing we have the leadership that we put -- that I'm offering.	0
ClaimBuster	20356	If they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit.	0
ClaimBuster	20357	So I'm not going to take up your time tonight, but let me just say this.	0
ClaimBuster	20358	But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	20359	We cannot lose those jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	20360	And that's why I think we can embody our values by passing a hate crimes law.	0
ClaimBuster	20361	She talks in favor of the rebels.	1
ClaimBuster	20362	However, there were things added in in the House side that we felt made it less of a good bill; as a matter of fact, made it a bad bill.	0
ClaimBuster	20363	Now, Governor Romney's proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military.	1
ClaimBuster	20364	That's why we're moving in the right direction.	0
ClaimBuster	20365	Now, 95 percent of the people in America will receive more money under my plan because they will receive not only their present benefits, which may be taxed, which will be taxed, but then you add $5,000 onto it, except for those people who have the gold-plated Cadillac insurance policies that have to do with cosmetic surgery and transplants and all of those kinds of things.	0
ClaimBuster	20366	And I need the help of everybody across this country to get it passed in a substantial way by the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	20367	He also said Saddam Hussein would have been stronger.	1
ClaimBuster	20368	So if repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse.	0
ClaimBuster	20369	Look, I -- I want to be very clear about what I said.	0
ClaimBuster	20370	That's not what we do.	0
ClaimBuster	20371	Five million people lost their homes.	1
ClaimBuster	20372	But in a nutshell we've got to reform our government or we won't get anything done.	0
ClaimBuster	20373	We've got a big difference there.	0
ClaimBuster	20374	Don't take my word for this.	0
ClaimBuster	20375	And even some in my own party, including my current vice president, had the same critique as you did.	1
ClaimBuster	20376	I don't ask people whether they're Republicans or Democrats.	0
ClaimBuster	20377	And I believe this is a final verdict on the failed economic policies of the last eight years, strongly promoted by President Bush and supported by Senator McCain, that essentially said that we should strip away regulations, consumer protections, let the market run wild, and prosperity would rain down on all of us.	1
ClaimBuster	20378	I know you're into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it's exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you.	1
ClaimBuster	20379	But I know how to get America working again, restore our economy and take care of working Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	20380	Ninety-nine United States senators voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	20381	But I pledge this to you, America: I will do it in the way that Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy and others did, where we build the strongest alliances, where the world joins together, where we have the best intelligence and where we are able, ultimately, to be more safe and secure.	0
ClaimBuster	20382	I am the one who's in the middle on this.	0
ClaimBuster	20383	I never said -- and I defy you to find where I said -- I gave an extensive environmental speech in April, and I said that we ought to have a goal of raising the fuel efficiency standards to 40 miles a gallon.	1
ClaimBuster	20384	I'll have millions of people at my shoulder, shoulder to shoulder with me, and we will see it done work speed -- because it's wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	20385	He, unlike my opponent, is an expert in national defense; helped amend the INF treaty so we got a good, sound treaty, when these people over here were talking about a freeze.	1
ClaimBuster	20386	For comparable states our size, we're signing them up as fast as any other state.	1
ClaimBuster	20387	But Columbine spoke to a larger issue.	0
ClaimBuster	20388	It has, as I said, delayed the actuarial imbalance falling on us for just a few years with that increase in taxes, and I don't believe we can go on increasing the tax, because the problem for the young people today is that they are paying in far more than they can ever expect to get out.	1
ClaimBuster	20389	It cost us billions, a couple billions of dollars, and I'm not so sure democracy is any better off in Haiti than it was before.	1
ClaimBuster	20390	Now, Governor Romney actually wants to expand those tax breaks.	1
ClaimBuster	20391	We have ten and a half million more jobs, a faster job growth rate than under any Republican administration since the 1920s.	1
ClaimBuster	20392	And this is what we've been trying to do, is involve the Federal Government in such partnerships.	0
ClaimBuster	20393	We're the most competitive country in the world now, and then just fight to open those markets and go try to make the sale, and that's what our trade ambassador our commerce secretary and all the other people in our administration are trying to do.	0
ClaimBuster	20394	It won't be painless but we've got to get the job done.	0
ClaimBuster	20395	You know, Mr. Bush has never appointed a judge.	1
ClaimBuster	20396	There may be a way of reaching out to the uninsured, because there are a lot of uninsured people in the country, particularly children, that should be covered.	0
ClaimBuster	20397	And I want to bring to the White House a sense of strength and fiscal responsibility which will build a good strong foundation under which this country, or above which country can move, grow, invest, and build the best America for its people and for our kids and our grandkids.	0
ClaimBuster	20398	It's a good one, though.	0
ClaimBuster	20399	One of them was a father who had been laid off a few months ago and lost his health insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	20400	The platform to which the President refers, in fact, calls for a religious test in the selection of judges.	0
ClaimBuster	20401	We must have a society that's just and fair.	0
ClaimBuster	20402	And you know what happened?	0
ClaimBuster	20403	And if you remember four years ago, we had not only rising unemployment, but a lot of rising cynicism.	1
ClaimBuster	20404	Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology.	1
ClaimBuster	20405	If they want to become a citizen, they can stand in line, too.	0
ClaimBuster	20406	Now, Senator McCain suggests that somehow, you know, I'm green behind the ears and, you know, I'm just spouting off, and he's somber and responsible.	0
ClaimBuster	20407	I don't think that's the role of the president to pick you're right and you're not right.	0
ClaimBuster	20408	I just think trying to be popular, kind of, in the global sense, if it's not in our best interest makes no sense.	0
ClaimBuster	20409	But what she doesn't say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.	1
ClaimBuster	20410	And thank you for agreeing to moderate this debate this evening.	0
ClaimBuster	20411	They will have a conservative bent.	0
ClaimBuster	20412	Well Mr. Edwards, as you probably know, I have consistently answered all questions with regard to who will be in the next cabinet by saying that that is the responsibility of the next president, and it would be inappropriate to make any decisions on that or to announce any prior to the time that I had the right to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	20413	The same way we treated the apartheid diplomats of South Africa.	0
ClaimBuster	20414	And we weren't diagnosing problems.	1
ClaimBuster	20415	I think the American people want to make certain that that dollar is wisely spent.	0
ClaimBuster	20416	I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be.	0
ClaimBuster	20417	She mentions this, which is all fiction, all fictionalized, probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	20418	I'm proud of the fact that violent crime is down in the State of Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	20419	After my trip to South America, I made recommendations that a separate inter-American lending agency be set up which the South American nations would like much better than a lend- than to participate in the lending agencies which treated all the countries of the world the same.	1
ClaimBuster	20420	But it is inappropriate for us, just because there's a problem somewhere around the world, to take the sons and daughters of working people--and make no mistake about it, our all- volunteer armed force is not made up of the sons and daughters of the beautiful people; it's the working folks who send their sons and daughters to war, with a few exceptions.	1
ClaimBuster	20421	I couldn't agree more about going forward, but I certainly don't want to go back to the policies of the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	20422	And a feature that allows parents to automatically check with one click what sites your kids have visited lately.	0
ClaimBuster	20423	He's president so I guess it's a little better deal.	0
ClaimBuster	20424	I know the Cuban state as a police state, and all my life I've worked in a way that demonstrates that.	0
ClaimBuster	20425	Is my time up yet?	0
ClaimBuster	20426	The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul.	1
ClaimBuster	20427	So you cannot compare unemployment, as you sought to, uh - with the present time with the 1950s, because the then administration had people in the military - they were at war, they were fighting overseas, and this administration has reduced the size of the military by a million four hundred thousand.	1
ClaimBuster	20428	This is an area where I've led on in the Senate, working with a Republican ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Dick Lugar, to deal with the proliferation of loose nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	20429	And if we've got math teachers who are able to provide the kind of support that they need for our kids, that's what's going to determine whether or not the new businesses are created here.	0
ClaimBuster	20430	The president decided to give it to the wealthiest Americans in a tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	20431	And I suggest that in a free society owned by the people, the American people ought to know what we told Ambassador Glaspie to tell Saddam Hussein, because we spent a lot of money and risked lives and lost lives in that effort, and did not accomplish most of our objectives.	1
ClaimBuster	20432	I want it to be streamlined.	0
ClaimBuster	20433	A cease-fire, the United States, Russia, and Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	20434	It's not whether we're better off, it's whether they're better off.	0
ClaimBuster	20435	If somebody is coming here to work with a card, it means they're not going to have to sneak across the border.	0
ClaimBuster	20436	And so seniors will have not only a Medicare plan where the poor seniors will have prescription drugs paid for, but there will be a variety of options.	0
ClaimBuster	20437	And, as I say, I don't believe that I could carry on unless I had a belief in a higher authority and a belief that prayers are answered.	0
ClaimBuster	20438	And it's hard to build a consensus.	0
ClaimBuster	20439	That's twice the amount that my predecessor increased VA funding.	1
ClaimBuster	20440	It's for their security as well as ours.	0
ClaimBuster	20441	... but we believed that we could make the country better.	0
ClaimBuster	20442	But that's happening as we sit here today.	0
ClaimBuster	20443	Secondly, as an executive leader.	0
ClaimBuster	20444	And I think that pattern is a dangerous thing to suggest would work for the Oval Office.	0
ClaimBuster	20445	And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off.	0
ClaimBuster	20446	And if they're not, there has to be a consequence.	0
ClaimBuster	20447	I've been an outdoorsman and a sportsman all my life.	1
ClaimBuster	20448	will go out and do the job that we expect of him and do it with the Congress of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	20449	Now, it's very important for our citizens to also know that I don't believe we ought to have amnesty.	0
ClaimBuster	20450	And people in Europe didn't like that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	20451	You mentioned Washington and Lincoln.	1
ClaimBuster	20452	Mr. McGee, I am planning a speech on that subject next week.	0
ClaimBuster	20453	He failed to take on somebody else -- the malpractice suit people, those that bring these lawsuits against -- these frivolous trial lawyers' lawsuits that are running the costs of medical care up 25 to 50 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	20454	There isn't any question but that we must move forward in every possible way to reduce the danger of war; to move toward controlled disarmament; to control tests; but also let's have in mind this: when Senator Kennedy suggests that we haven't been making an effort, he simply doesn't know what he's talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	20455	The math simply doesn't work.	1
ClaimBuster	20456	And that's the way it should be.	0
ClaimBuster	20457	And it's the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody who ran for president.	1
ClaimBuster	20458	Now that we've talked all around the problem about free trade, let's go again to the center of the bull's- eye.	0
ClaimBuster	20459	There is no bigger judgment for a president of the United states than how you take a nation to war.	0
ClaimBuster	20460	But it is a good program.	0
ClaimBuster	20461	Who's been managing this system?	0
ClaimBuster	20462	Well, that's a choice we have to make, isn't it?	0
ClaimBuster	20463	"I remember the headline in the Daily News that said, ""Ford to New York: Drop Dead."""	1
ClaimBuster	20464	Ladies and gentleman, he gave you a speech and told you he'd plan carefully, take every precaution, take our allies with us.	1
ClaimBuster	20465	We need to be disagreeing on ideas, honestly, and talking about the future.	0
ClaimBuster	20466	Not a single young American today is fighting or dying on any foreign battlefield.	1
ClaimBuster	20467	So the worst of all things has happened.	0
ClaimBuster	20468	Those who've come here illegally take their place.	0
ClaimBuster	20469	That is the present American position.	0
ClaimBuster	20470	Secondly, he says that medical liability costs only cause a 1 percent increase.	1
ClaimBuster	20471	I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	20472	No, it's not just campaign rhetoric.	0
ClaimBuster	20473	When I was asked by our government to do the POW project, within a year the Vietnamese had sent people into Canada to make arrangements to have me and my family killed.	1
ClaimBuster	20474	But the people are the ones that determine it.	1
ClaimBuster	20475	They grew up in the Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	20476	I am convinced, having studied health care for a year hard and talking to hundreds and hundreds of people all across America, that you cannot control the cost of Medicare until you control the cost of private health care and public health care, with managed competition, ceiling on cost, and radical reorganization of the insurance markets.	0
ClaimBuster	20477	I left my campaign and suspended it to go back to Washington to make sure that there were additional protections for the taxpayer in the form of good oversight, in the form of taxpayers being the first to be paid back when our economy recovers -- and it will recover -- and a number of other measures.	1
ClaimBuster	20478	And so, those are four ways to help control the costs in health care.	0
ClaimBuster	20479	I was a small oil person for a while in west Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	20480	I want you to be able to get a job.	0
ClaimBuster	20481	Well, Mr. Ford takes the uh - same attitude that the Republicans always take.	0
ClaimBuster	20482	But you won't change the law, because you take in so much money.	0
ClaimBuster	20483	That's an odd thing to say, since we've tripled the homeland security budget from $10 billion to $30 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	20484	Ross says, with great conviction, he opposes the North American Free Trade Agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	20485	They should be judged on their qualifications.	0
ClaimBuster	20486	We did not feel that I could commit.	0
ClaimBuster	20487	Under the 1981 tax bill, people making $200,000 a year got $60,000 in tax relief over 3 years, while people making $30,000 a year, all taxes considered, got no relief at all or their taxes actually went up.	1
ClaimBuster	20488	We're not going to go alone like this president did.	1
ClaimBuster	20489	Well, everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country's interests and our values.	0
ClaimBuster	20490	We were safer before President Bush came to office.	0
ClaimBuster	20491	But the idea of taxing people more, putting more people out of work, you'll never get there.	0
ClaimBuster	20492	But we turned it over to a maniacal fanatic who has slaughtered thousands and thousands of people, calling it executions.	1
ClaimBuster	20493	And we worked it out, and indeed we're moving forward all around the world in a much more peaceful way.	0
ClaimBuster	20494	I could answer a lot of these things tit for tat.	0
ClaimBuster	20495	"Now if the Senator in his answer to this question will say ""I now will depart, or retract my previous views; I think I was wrong in I 955; I think I was wrong in 1959; and I think I was wrong in our television debate to say that we should draw a line leaving out Quemoy and Matsu - draw a line in effect abandoning these islands to the Communists;"" then this will be right out of the campaign because there will be no issue between us."	0
ClaimBuster	20496	Now, let me say, some people say we can't do this but Hawaii does it.	0
ClaimBuster	20497	And we need to do our part.	0
ClaimBuster	20498	I would be very careful about using our troops as nation builders.	0
ClaimBuster	20499	Now with respect to the deficit, the president was handed a $5.6 trillion surplus, ladies and gentlemen.	1
ClaimBuster	20500	It took three and a half years.	1
ClaimBuster	20501	I believe we should have a stronger military force.	0
ClaimBuster	20502	And by the way, they noticed that you skipped Israel.	1
ClaimBuster	20503	Let -- let -- let's...	0
ClaimBuster	20504	Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300.	1
ClaimBuster	20505	In the last week, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I have re-read the testimony of General Twining representing the Administration in 1959, and the Assistant Secretary of State before the Foreign Relations Committee in 1958, and I have accurately described the Administration policy, and I support it wholeheartedly.	1
ClaimBuster	20506	One last point I want to make.	0
ClaimBuster	20507	And Saddam Hussein was a threat, and that we must spread liberty because in the long run, the way to defeat hatred and tyranny and oppression is to spread freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	20508	I'm interested in 240 million points of light.	0
ClaimBuster	20509	That was what he said.	1
ClaimBuster	20510	In the first place, uh - as is the case with the environmental policy and the energy policy that I just described, and the policy for nonproliferation of uh - of nuclear waste, this administration has no urban policy.	1
ClaimBuster	20511	Whenever a majority of the people are for a program, the House and the Senate responds to it.	1
ClaimBuster	20512	In August of 1960, when we tried to get it again, but this time for medical care, we received the support of one Republican in the Senate on this occasion.	1
ClaimBuster	20513	That's why I've called for an investment of $15 billion a year over 10 years.	1
ClaimBuster	20514	I think we need to go back and take a look.	0
ClaimBuster	20515	We will not make war inevitable.	0
ClaimBuster	20516	But you talk about judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	20517	He was asked this on Univision the other day.	1
ClaimBuster	20518	So we did have at that time with good management, the ability to do both.	0
ClaimBuster	20519	They don't want to see the world break out into -- into various forms of chaos, because they have to -- they have to manufacture goods and put people to work and they have about 20,000 -- 20 million, rather, people coming out of the farms every year coming into the cities, needing jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	20520	I feel strongly about it because I don't want it to come out of my time.	0
ClaimBuster	20521	I've talked to them and I've listened.	1
ClaimBuster	20522	I've proven that I can, and for 30 years, I've produced results for people.	0
ClaimBuster	20523	When you make that judgment, you are deciding not only the future of our nation; in a very profound respect, you're deciding the future of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	20524	... because I'm -- I'm so proud of the state that I had the chance to be governor of.	0
ClaimBuster	20525	I said we'd put, pass a crime bill that would put 100,000 police on the street, ban assault weapons, and deal with the problems that ought to be dealt with with capital punishment, including capital punishment for drug kingpins, and we did that.	1
ClaimBuster	20526	And because of the economy's slowing down, I think we can also expect less tax revenue so there's no doubt that as president I'm going to have to make some tough decision.	1
ClaimBuster	20527	I don't believe it will happen.	0
ClaimBuster	20528	Unfortunately, Governor Romney's plan doesn't do it.	0
ClaimBuster	20529	Exxon Mobil, and other oil companies, for example, would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks.	1
ClaimBuster	20530	I understand how hard it is to commit troops.	0
ClaimBuster	20531	We've got to be much more strategic if we're going to be able to deal with all of the challenges that we face out there.	0
ClaimBuster	20532	But I do know this: that if we were to follow that recommendation, that we would lose all of our friends in Latin America, we would probably be condemned in the United Nations, and we would not accomplish our objective.	0
ClaimBuster	20533	You did not say that you would provide government help.	1
ClaimBuster	20534	It's to make sure we raise standards.	0
ClaimBuster	20535	I just think it's wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	20536	We give you broader competition.	0
ClaimBuster	20537	Well no doubt about it, our founding fathers had a great deal of wisdom.	0
ClaimBuster	20538	I will fully research it, go forward as fast as we can.	0
ClaimBuster	20539	There are no magic answers to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	20540	You know, there are some things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	20541	Less dependency upon foreign sources of crude is good for consumers.	1
ClaimBuster	20542	The American Medical, Hospital Association, the Nurses Association, the Catholic Hospital Association all said hundreds of hospitals could close and people would be hurt badly under the Dole-Gingrich Medicare plan that I vetoed.	1
ClaimBuster	20543	Now please, folks, if you don't hear anything else I say, remember where the -- millions of people at work are our tax base.	0
ClaimBuster	20544	We absolutely must, which is why I responded to your first question the way I did.	0
ClaimBuster	20545	But do you realize that over the last ten years that's a higher figure than the average growth during that ten-year period?	1
ClaimBuster	20546	But they are now spending more money on advertising and promotion.	1
ClaimBuster	20547	You and others in this great country have worked hard and done a great deal to give your children and your grandchildren the blessings of a better America.	0
ClaimBuster	20548	And people who are going through them know that there's a job waiting for them if they complete it.	0
ClaimBuster	20549	But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant.	1
ClaimBuster	20550	And yet you take their money.	1
ClaimBuster	20551	He's health for the mother.	0
ClaimBuster	20552	I supported Nunn-Lugar back in the early 1990s when a lot of my colleagues didn't.	1
ClaimBuster	20553	The means are at issue.	0
ClaimBuster	20554	And again, I want to make it possible for all middle-class families to send their kids to college and more Pell grants for those who are in the lower income groups also, and then I want to make sure that we have job training on top of that and lifelong learning, but it all starts with the public school teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	20555	Rudy Giuliani, Mayor of New York, brought crime down 25 percent just in New York City.	1
ClaimBuster	20556	As the vice president is.	0
ClaimBuster	20557	That's what a Chief Executive Officer does.	0
ClaimBuster	20558	Every school and every school district, have every state test the children.	0
ClaimBuster	20559	Now, this has cost us deeply in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	20560	I think it's a good program.	0
ClaimBuster	20561	Senator Obama has asked for nearly $1 billion in pork-barrel earmark projects...	1
ClaimBuster	20562	And now we are back, because we have strengthened the defenses of this country, and believe me, I don't want to see us return to those days.	0
ClaimBuster	20563	And although there was a serious threat to the Social Security System and its integrity during the 1976 campaign and when I became President, the action of the Democratic Congress working with me has been to put Social Security back on a sound financial basis.	1
ClaimBuster	20564	It costs $20-25 billion a year, and I want to see those outrageous claims capped.	1
ClaimBuster	20565	If I lose this election, I will continue in the Senate to try to build a stronger country.	0
ClaimBuster	20566	So this is what our program is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	20567	And if you look at our tax policies, it's a classic example.	1
ClaimBuster	20568	If you don't control the health care costs of the entire system, you cannot get control of it.	0
ClaimBuster	20569	And if I heard the statement day before yesterday, you said you would order -- he said he would order his FDA appointee to review the decision.	1
ClaimBuster	20570	I kept the faith with my family.	0
ClaimBuster	20571	And we didn't touch it.	1
ClaimBuster	20572	I know he wants to disown it.	1
ClaimBuster	20573	That was precisely what I recommended and ultimately what happened.	1
ClaimBuster	20574	My friends, as I said in my opening remarks, these are very difficult times and challenges for America.	0
ClaimBuster	20575	Well, first of all, for the last four years we have worked had to put more and more pressure on the Castro government to bring about more openness and move toward democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	20576	I suggested that we amend our legislation so that we could enjoy closer economic ties.	1
ClaimBuster	20577	Instead of just comes the soft bigotry of low expectations, that there has to be a consequence.	0
ClaimBuster	20578	Personal earnings after taxes per capita have gone up almost $3,000 in these 4 years.	1
ClaimBuster	20579	I'm going to tell you Americans we'll get to work right away and we'll get to work together, and we can get them all done, because that's what America has been doing.	0
ClaimBuster	20580	Lincoln called this country the last best hope of man on earth.	1
ClaimBuster	20581	There was a time when there was hope for those who uh - were poor and downtrodden and who were - uh elderly or who were - uh ill or who were in minority groups, but that time has been gone.	0
ClaimBuster	20582	We're ahead in this competition, as Senator Kennedy, I think, has implied.	0
ClaimBuster	20583	The whole problem came up in 1984.	1
ClaimBuster	20584	And yes, it took me to veto 2 civil rights quota bills because I don't believe in quotas, and I don't think the American people believe in quotas.	1
ClaimBuster	20585	All history tells us that that's a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	20586	I look up and see the Soviet flag on the moon.	0
ClaimBuster	20587	They'll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous.	0
ClaimBuster	20588	I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox.	1
ClaimBuster	20589	We have enough problems in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	20590	I'm not going to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	20591	That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take.	1
ClaimBuster	20592	Thank you, Jim, and Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	20593	And also make sure that when they get out of college, there's a job.	0
ClaimBuster	20594	My grandfather died a while back.	1
ClaimBuster	20595	We've got the plan announced for what we can do for small business.	1
ClaimBuster	20596	No preferences to unqualified people, no quotas, but don't give up on making an extra effort until you're sure everybody has a chance to prove they're qualified.	0
ClaimBuster	20597	I don't want to cost jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	20598	Our schools are getting better, and our schools can be made to be even better still with the right kind of community leadership and partnership at the school level.	0
ClaimBuster	20599	He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes, federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, state property tax, gasoline tax.	1
ClaimBuster	20600	This is a serious threat to security in the world, and I believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	20601	That's what brings jobs in.	0
ClaimBuster	20602	And we're on the track on this one.	0
ClaimBuster	20603	But it is certainly my responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	20604	Middle-class people will have their fair share of changing to do, and many challenges to face, including the challenge of becoming constantly re-educated.	0
ClaimBuster	20605	I put my wallet on the table for you and your children.	1
ClaimBuster	20606	Your home mortgage interest deduction, charity, child tax credit, and so forth, you can use those as part of filling that bucket, if you will, of deductions.	0
ClaimBuster	20607	We ought to protect the American flag with a constitutional amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	20608	Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can -- name -- you almost can't name a good deal.	1
ClaimBuster	20609	Not only ships couldn't, but I'd say companies that are moving their oil can't, people who are trading in their oil can't.	0
ClaimBuster	20610	We've got to proceed very carefully on that.	0
ClaimBuster	20611	It's called premium support, but it's understood to be a voucher program.	1
ClaimBuster	20612	Now the United States, in this case, this administration, has recommended a year ago and we have reiterated it again this year, that the United States, South Korea, North Korea and the uh - People's Republic of China sit down at a conference table to resolve the problems of the Korean peninsula.	1
ClaimBuster	20613	I think there need to be reforms in the IMF.	0
ClaimBuster	20614	You can look at our tax returns.	0
ClaimBuster	20615	It has to have accountability and oversight.	0
ClaimBuster	20616	This country desperately needs a jobs program, and my first priority would be to pass a jobs program, to introduce it on the first day I was inaugurated.	0
ClaimBuster	20617	He was criticizing President Reagan.	1
ClaimBuster	20618	I will grant you that interest rates were too high in 1980, and we can have another debate as to why -- energy prices and so on.	0
ClaimBuster	20619	But there seems to be a lot of preoccupation on -- not certainly only in this debate, but just in general on law.	0
ClaimBuster	20620	The Lewin report is a group of folks who are not politically affiliated.	1
ClaimBuster	20621	I will never cede the authority of our country or our security to any other nation.	0
ClaimBuster	20622	I'm glad you clarified that.	0
ClaimBuster	20623	But our goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the U.N. resolutions that have been in place.	0
ClaimBuster	20624	Now, the President spoke a moment ago about that I was against the minimum wage.	1
ClaimBuster	20625	Now I would be willing to go ahead with negotiations.	0
ClaimBuster	20626	So this comes from the people.	0
ClaimBuster	20627	We will have to have people play on a fair basis, that's number one.	0
ClaimBuster	20628	I respect his right to disagree with me.	0
ClaimBuster	20629	The cornerstone is to have strong accountability in return for money and in return for flexibility.	0
ClaimBuster	20630	That's why I proposed a hydrogen automobile -- hydrogen-generated automobile.	1
ClaimBuster	20631	Seven out of eight years, the budget commitments for defense went down, 37% in all.	1
ClaimBuster	20632	Intensive reading laboratories, teacher retraining.	0
ClaimBuster	20633	Our airports are like from a third world country.	0
ClaimBuster	20634	We need to have rewards.	0
ClaimBuster	20635	The president also took Medicare, which belongs to you.	1
ClaimBuster	20636	Number two, keep working with the states, as we are now, to add 2.2 million more people to the insurance system.	0
ClaimBuster	20637	Let me talk about tax relief.	0
ClaimBuster	20638	Going back 23 years, I don't know, Helen.	0
ClaimBuster	20639	The Lewin report accurately noted that there are going to be 20 million people, over 20 million people added to government-controlled health care.	1
ClaimBuster	20640	Will we have a world of hunger and - and hatred, and will we be living in an armed camp stripped of our friendship and allies hiding behind a tight defense that's been drawn in around us because we are fearful of the outside world?	0
ClaimBuster	20641	I think it's very important to keep the debt going down and completely eliminate it.	0
ClaimBuster	20642	"As George Will said the other day, ""Freedom on the march; not in Russia right now."""	1
ClaimBuster	20643	Of course, I've talked to people like Joe the plumber and tell him that I'm not going to spread his wealth around.	1
ClaimBuster	20644	Now, that is not the judgment that a president of the United States ought to make.	0
ClaimBuster	20645	Seventy-two other nations have been able to do it.	1
ClaimBuster	20646	We've got to pay it back.	0
ClaimBuster	20647	Who would write the prayer?	0
ClaimBuster	20648	We should have more debates.	0
ClaimBuster	20649	The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together.	1
ClaimBuster	20650	It is actuarially out of balance, and this first became evident about 16 years ago, and some of us were voicing warnings then.	1
ClaimBuster	20651	So, I can only tell you about the manual -- that we're not in the habit of assigning guilt before there has been proper evidence produced and proof of that guilt.	0
ClaimBuster	20652	And he has made the point that you have not repudiated some of the semidiplomatic activity of the Reverend Jackson, particularly in Central America.	1
ClaimBuster	20653	Saddam Hussein still is a threat in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	20654	We've got to get costs down, increase value, emphasize wellness.	0
ClaimBuster	20655	It's kind of like a political issue as opposed to a people issue.	0
ClaimBuster	20656	I want to help those with disabilities fit into the mainstream.	0
ClaimBuster	20657	Let me tell you why.	0
ClaimBuster	20658	"He went after John McCain, a prisoner of war, said he prefers ""people who aren't captured."""	1
ClaimBuster	20659	But we shouldn't have been there in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	20660	Another way you can do is to expand Medicaid.	0
ClaimBuster	20661	I grant you that prices may go up, because as you go further and have to go deeper, you are adding to the cost of production.	0
ClaimBuster	20662	If you allow -- also allow -- convince states to -- allow states to allow the mother to match some of the children's health insurance money with it, the pool purchasing power.	0
ClaimBuster	20663	A President must manage that budget.	0
ClaimBuster	20664	And it has got to be brought under control.	0
ClaimBuster	20665	Because new breakthroughs in atomic energy technology there's some indications that by the time the next president's term of office has come to an end, there may be ten, fifteen, or twenty countries with an atomic capacity, perhaps that many testing bombs with all the effect that it could have on the atmosphere and with all the chances that more and more countries will have an atomic capacity, with more and more chance of war.	0
ClaimBuster	20666	We haven't seen the language yet.	1
ClaimBuster	20667	Now, I say whose country is this?	0
ClaimBuster	20668	And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have.	1
ClaimBuster	20669	States like Florida, Colorado, Virginia, and other states.	0
ClaimBuster	20670	I'm going to give them $5,000 to take with them wherever they want to go, and this will give them affordability.	0
ClaimBuster	20671	But I am committed to the one at Portsmouth, Ohio.	0
ClaimBuster	20672	I would take eh - the strongest possible measures short of uh - actual military uh - action there by our own troops, but I doubt that that would be an eventuality.	0
ClaimBuster	20673	If we don't resolve that issue, all others become irrelevant.	0
ClaimBuster	20674	Number one, under my program we would provide matching funds to states to teach everybody with a job to read in the next 5 years and give everybody with a job the chance to get a high school diploma, in big places on the job.	0
ClaimBuster	20675	I think of the man who grabbed me by the shoulder once with tears in his eyes and said his daughter was dying of cancer and he thanked me for giving him a chance to spend some time with her without losing his job because of the Family and Medical Leave Act.	1
ClaimBuster	20676	When -- when he was asked would class size...	0
ClaimBuster	20677	And that launched a campaign to try to get the record companies to put ratings that -- warning labels for parents.	1
ClaimBuster	20678	Just the ground rules here.	0
ClaimBuster	20679	When you came to office, just over $10 trillion in debt, now $16 trillion in debt.	1
ClaimBuster	20680	Then when we had the assault weapons ban in the Senate, Senator Dole fought it bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost brought the entire crime bill down because the National Rifle Association didn't want the assault weapons ban, just like they didn't want the Brady Bill.	1
ClaimBuster	20681	And I think I did a good job.	0
ClaimBuster	20682	I have been talking to a number of Congressmen who have much the same idea that I have, and that is that in the inner city areas, that in cooperation with the local government and the national Government, and using tax incentives and with cooperating with the private sector, that we have development zones.	0
ClaimBuster	20683	He's said that it's been a policy that has led to defeat and retreat.	1
ClaimBuster	20684	And that is, I want to give middle-class families and folks who are striving to get into the middle-class some relief.	0
ClaimBuster	20685	The facts are after my plan, the wealthiest of Americans pay more taxes of the percentage of the whole than they do today.	1
ClaimBuster	20686	Libya is now peacefully dismantling its weapons programs.	1
ClaimBuster	20687	There are 43 million of us.	1
ClaimBuster	20688	And that's been lacking in the last eight years.	0
ClaimBuster	20689	It's been tried for 12 years and it's failed.	1
ClaimBuster	20690	And I only want to say that however good the record is, it's got to be better.	0
ClaimBuster	20691	I believe that our power and prestige in the last eight years has declined.	0
ClaimBuster	20692	And there's one going on right now, which we don't know about it.	1
ClaimBuster	20693	It's a $500 per child tax credit.	1
ClaimBuster	20694	Now, can't somebody agree with me that the government is breaking business's legs with these trade agreements?	0
ClaimBuster	20695	I fought for, and the Congress finally went along with a general revenue sharing program, whereby cities and uh - states, uh - the cities two-thirds and the states one-third, get over six billion dollars a year in cash through which they can uh - provide many, many services, whatever they really want.	1
ClaimBuster	20696	But those are not the things that count.	0
ClaimBuster	20697	We -- we had to go into Pakistan.	0
ClaimBuster	20698	Over the last ten years since he's been governor, they're 30% behind, 30% -- they're 30% of the national average.	1
ClaimBuster	20699	So let's talk about this.	0
ClaimBuster	20700	Savings accounts are losing money instead of gaining money.	1
ClaimBuster	20701	I had hoped this had been a little friendlier evening.	0
ClaimBuster	20702	In the past, those minority groups have often been excluded from participation in the affairs of government.	1
ClaimBuster	20703	Some of them have been Democrats and some of them have been Republicans.	1
ClaimBuster	20704	There are other ways to make sure drugs are cheaper.	0
ClaimBuster	20705	As a result of securing ourselves and ridding the Taliban out of Afghanistan, the Afghan people had elections this weekend.	1
ClaimBuster	20706	So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory.	1
ClaimBuster	20707	And we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region, you know, the Estonians, the Lithuanians, the Latvians, the Poles, the Czechs, that we are, in fact, going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts.	0
ClaimBuster	20708	Well first may I correct a statement which was made before, that under my agricultural program food prices would go up twenty-five percent.	0
ClaimBuster	20709	I came to Washington to solve problems.	1
ClaimBuster	20710	Not reducing the interest -	0
ClaimBuster	20711	And you know, there were some of us that stood up two years ago and said we've got to enact legislation to fix this.	1
ClaimBuster	20712	It is being blocked by the Republican leadership in the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	20713	How can we help people as we are to get their retirements when they work for small businesses, to be able to afford health insurance, to be able to educate their children.	0
ClaimBuster	20714	Yes, and I'll apply it to Congress too.	0
ClaimBuster	20715	The president also unfortunately gave in to the chemical industry, which didn't want to do some of the things necessary to strengthen our chemical plant exposure.	1
ClaimBuster	20716	But if you just want to keep the music going, just stay traditional this next time around, and 4 years from now you'll have everybody blaming everybody else for a bad health care system.	0
ClaimBuster	20717	The Ford administration wants to eradicate hunger and disease in our underdeveloped countries throughout the world.	0
ClaimBuster	20718	And I'm only here to tell you that I believe with all my heart that our first priority must be world peace, and that use of force is always and only a last resort, when everything else has failed, and then only with regard to our national security.	0
ClaimBuster	20719	But I said they have to focus on terror, also.	1
ClaimBuster	20720	Number two, we're going to increase our trade.	0
ClaimBuster	20721	For a long time our American citizens have been excluded, sometimes misled, sometimes have been lied to.	0
ClaimBuster	20722	Look at Sarah Brady, Jim Brady's wife, President Reagan's press secretary, who endorsed me because he knuckled under to the NRA and wouldn't fight for the Brady Bill.	1
ClaimBuster	20723	I have to say that Governor Romney criticized me for being too tough in that tire case; said this wouldn't be good for American workers and that it would be protectionist.	1
ClaimBuster	20724	In the communities which have had real success putting police officers near schools where kids carry weapons, to get the weapons out of the schools, are on the same blocks, you've seen crime go down.	1
ClaimBuster	20725	I believe everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief.	0
ClaimBuster	20726	And it's Katherine Fenton, who has a question for you.	0
ClaimBuster	20727	We ought to put the homeowners first.	0
ClaimBuster	20728	Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now?	0
ClaimBuster	20729	I think those are very very serious questions of judgment, which those of you who are watching us here tonight have a right to judge and review.	0
ClaimBuster	20730	So we're already beginning to see progress.	1
ClaimBuster	20731	We passed landmark legislation in '84.	1
ClaimBuster	20732	And, with faith in God and with conviction in the mission of America, I believe that we can reach higher.	0
ClaimBuster	20733	It averaged about 18% in the first quarter of this year.	1
ClaimBuster	20734	This sounds like real progress here, because we've had a big difference on the safe use of nuclear power for our energy base.	0
ClaimBuster	20735	We haven't done that yet.	0
ClaimBuster	20736	Look at the misery index when the Democrats had both the White House and the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	20737	I'm just telling you our state comes together to do what is right.	0
ClaimBuster	20738	I just have to correct the record.	0
ClaimBuster	20739	That we must cut back.	0
ClaimBuster	20740	The ideals and the values of the United States inspired the entire world.	0
ClaimBuster	20741	What I downgrade, Mr. Nixon, is the leadership the country is getting, not the country.	0
ClaimBuster	20742	It's causing high interest rates.	0
ClaimBuster	20743	And I -- and to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	20744	That's what's wrong with Mr. Bush.	0
ClaimBuster	20745	Now, I have set as strong an example as I can, then at that point when we sit down over at Capitol Hill -- tomorrow night I'm going to be talking about government reform -- it's a long subject, you wouldn't let me finish tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	20746	Incidentally, just this past week, the crown jewel in that program that he had devised was stolen, I guess, because a conference committee turned down the ambitious plan that he had to increase the amount of money that would be available to the Economic Development Administration for loan guarantees and direct loans and credits.	1
ClaimBuster	20747	And when I stood up there and spoke to the Congress, I was speaking off the same intelligence he looked at to make his decisions to support the authorization of force.	1
ClaimBuster	20748	I think the economy has meant more for the Gore and Clinton folks than the Gore and Clinton folks have meant for the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	20749	I once said, in a frivolous moment, when he got out of the race: If you can't stand the heat, buy an air conditioning company.	1
ClaimBuster	20750	Maybe you put off buying a new car.	0
ClaimBuster	20751	What I object to here is the constant reference to surrendering these islands.	0
ClaimBuster	20752	He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood.	1
ClaimBuster	20753	I've got reply on that.	0
ClaimBuster	20754	Take it out of politics.	0
ClaimBuster	20755	But it won't be possible to do, if his tax scheme passes because even his own campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says he'll have to cut Medicare even more than was cut in the bill that I vetoed.	1
ClaimBuster	20756	Of course the greatest threat of all is Iran, four years closer to a nuclear weapon.	0
ClaimBuster	20757	Who has the perseverance, the character, the integrity, the maturity, to get the job done?	0
ClaimBuster	20758	I want to bring the rates down, at the same time lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth, so we keep getting the revenue we need.	0
ClaimBuster	20759	But I want to remind you, the number of uninsured in America during their watch has increased.	1
ClaimBuster	20760	If I had it to do over again I might answer the questions a little better.	0
ClaimBuster	20761	Mr. Kalb, I think what has been hailed as something I'm supposedly, as President, discussing as principle is the recall of just some philosophical discussions with people who are interested in the same things; and that is the prophecies down through the years, the biblical prophecies of what would portend the coming of Armageddon, and so forth, and the fact that a number of theologians for the last decade or more have believed that this was true, that the prophecies are coming together that portend that.	0
ClaimBuster	20762	Now, I think that it's very important to understand that cutting benefits under Social Security means that people like Winifred Skinner from Des Moines, Iowa, who is here, would really have a much harder time.	0
ClaimBuster	20763	And we have to be very vigilant.	0
ClaimBuster	20764	I say that because I think, this year, we will send $90 billion out of this country to pay for imported oil, even though that.	0
ClaimBuster	20765	Why isn't she funding, not for $100 million, but why don't you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?	0
ClaimBuster	20766	This will cost some money on the front end, but over the long term this is the only way that not only are we going to make families healthy, but it's also how we're going to save the federal budget, because we can't afford these escalating costs.	0
ClaimBuster	20767	It's one way to help reduce abortions.	0
ClaimBuster	20768	I'd like to know, Anderson, why aren't you bringing up the e-mails?	0
ClaimBuster	20769	The people deserve that since we have to pick up the tab; you got the PAC money, we'll pay the tab.	0
ClaimBuster	20770	If my daughter or yours looks to somebody like they're not a citizen, I don't want -- I don't want to empower somebody like that.	0
ClaimBuster	20771	I would have someone ride herd on those regulations, and we would start eliminating those discriminations in the Federal Government against women.	0
ClaimBuster	20772	There are six countries in Africa that are members of the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	20773	It's a contract between generations.	0
ClaimBuster	20774	These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	20775	He was deceiving the inspectors.	1
ClaimBuster	20776	Well, it would be if they're given special protective status.	0
ClaimBuster	20777	They have to help us out.	0
ClaimBuster	20778	Very interesting why she's leaving carried interest.	0
ClaimBuster	20779	I think -- you know, I'm starting to understand it.	0
ClaimBuster	20780	I disagree, strongly disagree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	20781	And I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors -- Republican and Democrats -- said, please let us do that.	1
ClaimBuster	20782	And NAFTA doesn't have -- did not have enforceable labor agreements and environmental agreements.	1
ClaimBuster	20783	By 1980 that same person was $500 below the poverty line.	1
ClaimBuster	20784	And to establish a permanent home heating oil reserve here in the northeast.	1
ClaimBuster	20785	I also had a program starting last year.	1
ClaimBuster	20786	We've made some progress during the last eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	20787	And he's kept his head up.	0
ClaimBuster	20788	And thank you for tuning in this evening.	0
ClaimBuster	20789	And ever since that time, I've tried to give something back to my country, to the people who are watching us tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	20790	I'm not interested in his character.	0
ClaimBuster	20791	I think you have to take on medical fraud.	0
ClaimBuster	20792	And then make sure they have the arms necessary to defend themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	20793	I've met them in Appleton, Wisconsin.	1
ClaimBuster	20794	First of all, the world is still a dangerous and uncertain place.	0
ClaimBuster	20795	I'm concerned that we're overdeployed around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	20796	In the Truman Administration, six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain including the satellite countries of Eastern Europe and Communist China.	1
ClaimBuster	20797	Yes, I think the next president of the United States should make one last effort to secure an agreement on the cessation of tests, number one.	0
ClaimBuster	20798	That there is some resentment of U.S. power.	0
ClaimBuster	20799	The President told the terrorists he was going to retaliate.	1
ClaimBuster	20800	We've piled up over a trillion dollars in debt and the next president of the United States is going to have to make some choices.	1
ClaimBuster	20801	We set up a simple structure of government that could be administrated fairly and it was a - a tremendous success.	0
ClaimBuster	20802	We don't have to settle for unemployment at a chronically high level.	0
ClaimBuster	20803	In Lebanon, I stood up to President Reagan, my hero, and said, if we send Marines in there, how can we possibly beneficially affect this situation?	1
ClaimBuster	20804	Mr. Ford is a good and decent man, but he's in - been in office now more than eight hundred days approaching almost as long as John Kennedy was in office.	1
ClaimBuster	20805	If you don't like what I did, you should have changed the laws.	0
ClaimBuster	20806	Neighborhoods are safer when we crack down on people who commit crimes with guns.	0
ClaimBuster	20807	Now, I don't think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it just doesn't work out that way.	0
ClaimBuster	20808	When he gave you that biggest tax increase in history; when he tried to take over your healthcare system.	1
ClaimBuster	20809	We've got to recruit 100,000 new teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	20810	And it's true on this and it's true on CAFE.	1
ClaimBuster	20811	I suggest that people go up on the Web site of Citizens Against Government Waste, and they'll look at those projects.	0
ClaimBuster	20812	But look, I also think we ought to give a little credit to the President of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	20813	It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented.	0
ClaimBuster	20814	But no one knows whether Armageddon, those prophecies mean that Armageddon is a thousand years away or day after tomorrow.	0
ClaimBuster	20815	And they can say that the President of the United States and the United States of America has stood on the right side of history.	0
ClaimBuster	20816	Her name is Alicia Machado.	1
ClaimBuster	20817	This president thought it was more important to give the wealthiest people in America a tax cut rather than invest in homeland security.	1
ClaimBuster	20818	To me that means we have to go on and balance this budget while we protect Medicare and Medicaid and education and the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	20819	Mr. President, countries are leaving the coalition, not joining.	1
ClaimBuster	20820	And we need to fix a lot of the problems.	0
ClaimBuster	20821	I think that by speaking clearly and doing what we say and not sending mixed messages, it is less likely we'll ever have to use troops.	0
ClaimBuster	20822	And he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation from the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy.	1
ClaimBuster	20823	So I want to make sure that we make -- we make America more competitive.	0
ClaimBuster	20824	But when Governor Romney says that he has a very different economic plan, the centerpiece of his economic plan are tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	20825	If I can get you to defend me and I can spend all my money building industry that's a home run for me.	0
ClaimBuster	20826	Now you tell me who stands on the side of the fence.	0
ClaimBuster	20827	And private insurers have to make a profit.	0
ClaimBuster	20828	And I'd be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six- foot portrait of Donald.	1
ClaimBuster	20829	And therefore I want to rebuild the military power.	0
ClaimBuster	20830	In spite of his policies.	0
ClaimBuster	20831	Got four more years, I've got more to do to continue to raise standards, to continue to reward teachers and school districts that are working, to emphasize math and science in the classrooms, to continue to expand Pell Grants to make sure that people have an opportunity to start their career with a college diploma.	0
ClaimBuster	20832	We need to make sure as well that we coordinate this effort with our allies, and particularly with -- with Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	20833	It's going to be one of my highest priorities because transportation accounts for about 30 percent of our total energy consumption.	1
ClaimBuster	20834	Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum.	1
ClaimBuster	20835	Just on Monday of this week I signed a tax bill that included an amendment that would prevent companies in the United States from taking a tax deduction if they have in any way whatsoever cooperated with the Arab boycott.	1
ClaimBuster	20836	And instead directed the money toward a tax cut, a significant part of which went to wealthy interests.	1
ClaimBuster	20837	But Governor Clinton refuses to touch that, simply refuses.	1
ClaimBuster	20838	And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there.	0
ClaimBuster	20839	I pass factories that were thriving 20, 25 years ago, and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100 percent, it is just horrible what's happened to these people in these communities.	1
ClaimBuster	20840	And last week when we were trying to get the Export Administration Act through the Congress - necessary legislation - my administration went to Capitol Hill and tried to convince the House and the Senate that we should have an amendment on that legislation which would take strong and effective action against those who uh - participate or cooperate with the Arab uh boycott.	1
ClaimBuster	20841	And the result is our forces today are overextended.	0
ClaimBuster	20842	I of course disagree with Senator Kennedy insofar as his suggestions as to what should be done uh - with re- on the farm program.	0
ClaimBuster	20843	The world is more dangerous today because the president didn't make the right judgments.	0
ClaimBuster	20844	And I'm very happy that John Kennedy was elected, because John Kennedy looked at the future with courage, saw what needed to be done, and understood his own government.	0
ClaimBuster	20845	In the aftermath of Vietnam, Cambodia, Chile, Pakistan, Angola, Watergate, CIA, we've been hurt.	0
ClaimBuster	20846	Well -- well, but she said one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	20847	I think we have to make a greater effort than we have been making at the secretary of state level, at the ambassadorial level, to work out the differences that we have.	0
ClaimBuster	20848	So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders.	1
ClaimBuster	20849	I wouldn't violate anything my mother said.	0
ClaimBuster	20850	So, first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	20851	It will come from the pockets of the people.	0
ClaimBuster	20852	They've wound up not even extending unemployment benefits and not even extending health care to those people who are unemployed.	1
ClaimBuster	20853	So it's easy to talk about this stuff during a campaign, but it's important for us to understand that it requires a sustained effort from the next president.	0
ClaimBuster	20854	And how do we expect to be able to implement those?	0
ClaimBuster	20855	They will want to do what's good for our country.	0
ClaimBuster	20856	Nobody suggested sending troops to Iraq, if that was the hint there from the President.	1
ClaimBuster	20857	If you leave a business, I think your insurance should go with you to some other business.	0
ClaimBuster	20858	"We just did a drug bust a week earlier, and the guy we arrested had an AK-47 lying on the bed right beside him. """	1
ClaimBuster	20859	He raised a whole bunch of them.	0
ClaimBuster	20860	That's why I'm so strong for accountability.	0
ClaimBuster	20861	It was locker room talk, as I told you.	1
ClaimBuster	20862	We ought to reach out, make certain everybody has a chance to participate.	0
ClaimBuster	20863	And it's going to take discipline of the executive branch; it's going to take discipline of the congressional branch.	0
ClaimBuster	20864	But again, we have a big difference on child care, for example.	0
ClaimBuster	20865	People in the coal industry feel like it's getting crushed by your policies.	1
ClaimBuster	20866	Businesses can contribute, employees can contribute on a contractual basis.	0
ClaimBuster	20867	Colin Powell will be on somebody's ticket 4 years from now -- right?	0
ClaimBuster	20868	He would also strip away the ability of states to provide some of the regulations on insurance companies to make sure you're not excluded for pre-existing conditions or your mammograms are covered or your maternity is covered.	0
ClaimBuster	20869	So I believe America's less safe.	0
ClaimBuster	20870	Now, if later on after a period of time we find that Social Security is in trouble, we'll pull together the top experts of the country.	0
ClaimBuster	20871	There is no question that the poor are worse off.	0
ClaimBuster	20872	The problem, Mr. Bush, is that you've cut back by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable housing for families of low and moderate income.	1
ClaimBuster	20873	But the important thing is -- the important thing is I visited Afghanistan and I traveled to Waziristan and I traveled to these places and I know what our security requirements are.	1
ClaimBuster	20874	I was going to applaud, too.	0
ClaimBuster	20875	One last point on the missiles.	0
ClaimBuster	20876	But let me talk back about where we've been.	0
ClaimBuster	20877	I proposed one to the Congress two years ago, encourages conservation, encourages technology to explore for environmentally friendly ways for coal -- to use coal and gas.	1
ClaimBuster	20878	You took General Motors bankrupt.	1
ClaimBuster	20879	And this is something Republicans have used for a long time.	1
ClaimBuster	20880	We're No.1 in automobile manufacturing production and sales around the world again, the first time since 1970s.	1
ClaimBuster	20881	I don't know of a city in America that doesn't have the kind of problems you're talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	20882	And nobody's going to question my patriotism as the vice president has now repeatedly.	0
ClaimBuster	20883	Now we have a very, very wide-ranging group of advisers who help me prepare for these debates and who teach me about international economics, and foreign affairs, defense matters, health, education, welfare, government reorganization.	1
ClaimBuster	20884	I also think that that unborn child has a right to be wanted.	0
ClaimBuster	20885	And I appreciated the way the administration signed the Defense of Marriage Act.	0
ClaimBuster	20886	But nobody called Sean Hannity.	1
ClaimBuster	20887	This is the kind of record that's there and talk about the future and a drastic change or conversion on the part of Mr. Ford as of last minute is one that just doesn't go.	0
ClaimBuster	20888	The only thing I believe is that whatever the - the knowledge was that Mr. Ford had should have been given to the American people eighteen months ago, immediately after the Mayaguez uh - incident occurred.	0
ClaimBuster	20889	We are not at war.	1
ClaimBuster	20890	I don't think we should spend tax money on private schools.	0
ClaimBuster	20891	So we've got to figure out how are we going to have more people with pension plans, and pension coverage has been declining as more and more people work for small businesses and fewer people work for big businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	20892	It's a threat to the stability of the entire Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	20893	We're all focused on China.	0
ClaimBuster	20894	And we have to stop the violence.	0
ClaimBuster	20895	We're 9 million jobs short of that.	1
ClaimBuster	20896	Both at home and abroad, he has proposed wrong and reckless policies.	0
ClaimBuster	20897	The commanders and the generals there are on track to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	20898	It took me about three years to completely reorganize the Georgia government.	1
ClaimBuster	20899	We need to put the pressure on them as hard as we possibly can, because if we do that, we won't have to take the military action.	0
ClaimBuster	20900	We have no plans to sell additional materiel or goods to Iran, that might be of a warlike nature.	0
ClaimBuster	20901	I uh - believe, however, a comment ought to be made about the direction of the uh - Burger Court, vis-a-vis the uh - court uh - that preceded it.	0
ClaimBuster	20902	Well, I was raised to have a faith and a belief and have been a member of a church since I was a small boy.	1
ClaimBuster	20903	I think that is the wrong choice.	0
ClaimBuster	20904	I strongly support new investments in clean coal technology.	0
ClaimBuster	20905	That makes a difference in whether they can go out there and -- and earn a living for their family.	0
ClaimBuster	20906	Now, Governor Romney has ruled out revenue.	1
ClaimBuster	20907	We didn't recognize them for two months; the American Ambassador didn't show up for nearly eight months.	1
ClaimBuster	20908	It does not happen that the church that I belong to had that as part of its dogma.	1
ClaimBuster	20909	And I believe if we do a better job in education, we'll -- we'll give people the -- the hope and opportunity they deserve and perhaps less violence from that.	0
ClaimBuster	20910	But -- but I want to talk about the values behind Social Security and Medicare, and then talk about Medicare, because that's the big driver of our deficits right now.	0
ClaimBuster	20911	Let me tell you where the biggest discrimination comes.	0
ClaimBuster	20912	If you like your high premiums, you keep them.	0
ClaimBuster	20913	I think it might have been one of my opponent's ads.	0
ClaimBuster	20914	It may be Republican, it may be Democratic.	0
ClaimBuster	20915	But let me just say to America: I am not proposing a government-run program.	0
ClaimBuster	20916	It's because we got everybody to agree that Iran is seeing so much pressure.	0
ClaimBuster	20917	And they came up with a variety of ideas for people to look at.	0
ClaimBuster	20918	I was honored to speak to those troops.	0
ClaimBuster	20919	So Congress passes the law, the President signs it, like he does a lot of things.	1
ClaimBuster	20920	A year ago, I went to Wall Street and said we've got to reregulate, and nothing happened.	1
ClaimBuster	20921	And that's what Osama bin Laden's handbook said, because we captured it in Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	20922	The Economist magazine polled lots of economists, seven Nobel prize winners who said if this tax scheme passes, it will require huge cuts, 40 percent, in the environment and law enforcement and education.	1
ClaimBuster	20923	We can't afford that kind of growth in federal spending.	0
ClaimBuster	20924	And some of the cuts, just to give you an example, we spend $15 billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies.	1
ClaimBuster	20925	It all sounds to me like you're going to have some government setting price.	0
ClaimBuster	20926	You might remember the stock market started to decline dramatically six months before I came to office, and then the bubble of the 1990s popped.	1
ClaimBuster	20927	See, Willow Run could be converted from cars to airplanes in World War II because it was here.	1
ClaimBuster	20928	But I -- I couldn't do that.	0
ClaimBuster	20929	They shouldn't misuse their bench.	0
ClaimBuster	20930	We're selling Japanese rice from California for the first time.	1
ClaimBuster	20931	I respect their -- I respect -- on the one hand he says he agrees with me and then he says he doesn't.	0
ClaimBuster	20932	He's been in the United States Senate 20 years.	1
ClaimBuster	20933	And it's a disgrace, and I will do my level best to clean it up, recognizing that you can't legislate morality.	0
ClaimBuster	20934	And let's take the example of energy, which we already spoke about.	0
ClaimBuster	20935	Well, how about this for a government reform policy?	0
ClaimBuster	20936	And I know it's necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	20937	As a matter of fact, there has been less than one-quarter of 1 percent of foreclosures of the 270,000 loans from government that the farmers have.	1
ClaimBuster	20938	In some ways, he's gone to a more extreme place when it comes to social policy.	0
ClaimBuster	20939	And the breakdown of the political process in Ukraine between Tymoshenko and Yushchenko is a very serious problem.	0
ClaimBuster	20940	But we know from the people he's tried to appoint to the court he wants to.	0
ClaimBuster	20941	Are you for it without quotas?	0
ClaimBuster	20942	Help me pass these programs.	0
ClaimBuster	20943	Right now we spend about $300 billion a year on defense, the Japanese spend around 30 billion in Asia, the Germans spend around 30 billion in Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	20944	And you've got to be firm and consistent.	0
ClaimBuster	20945	Companies are going to locate here depending on whether we've got the most highly skilled workforce.	1
ClaimBuster	20946	I think these questions are inherently personal and moral, and every individual instance is different.	0
ClaimBuster	20947	And so let's look at our records as well as our rhetoric.	0
ClaimBuster	20948	But when I was in that little church across the river from Washington and saw our grandchild christened in our faith, I was very pleased indeed that the mother had not aborted that child, and put the child up for adoption.	1
ClaimBuster	20949	Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly -- and she was extremely angry about it.	1
ClaimBuster	20950	Now, in this connection I want to point out that the facts simply aren't as stated.	0
ClaimBuster	20951	It's not about President Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	20952	It starts with making sure every child learns to read.	0
ClaimBuster	20953	You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue?	1
ClaimBuster	20954	We can't leave a failed Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	20955	As soon as I have -- first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	20956	When that field is online it will produce one million barrels a day.	0
ClaimBuster	20957	I would also like to uh - completely revise our criminal justice system - to do some of the things at the federal level in court reform that I've just described, as has been done in Georgia and other states.	0
ClaimBuster	20958	I don't want to hear them.	0
ClaimBuster	20959	Number 2, we would provide 2-year apprenticeship programs to high school graduates who don't go to college.	0
ClaimBuster	20960	It's what the federal government does to you.	0
ClaimBuster	20961	We should have been much tougher on trade even then.	0
ClaimBuster	20962	There's another group that I feel very close to, and these at the men and women who fought on the battlefield, the children -- the families -- of the ones who died and the people who left parts of their bodies over there.	0
ClaimBuster	20963	Now Senator Kennedy has made some very strong criticisms of my part - or alleged part - in what has happened in Cuba.	1
ClaimBuster	20964	You didn't do that with Mr. with President Bush in 1992.	1
ClaimBuster	20965	And I stand for programs that will mean growth and progress.	0
ClaimBuster	20966	This is going to take fair, shared sacrifice.	0
ClaimBuster	20967	If the president's reelected, Obamacare will be fully installed.	0
ClaimBuster	20968	This is the most religious, great country in history.	0
ClaimBuster	20969	I have never heard a candidate for President, who is a Republican, quote a Republican president, but when they get in office, they try to govern like Republicans.	0
ClaimBuster	20970	But I have tremendous respect for women.	0
ClaimBuster	20971	I do not want any more trickle down government.	0
ClaimBuster	20972	And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	20973	And what we're seeing right now is, in my view, a -- a trickle-down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams.	0
ClaimBuster	20974	Also, in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia and uh - Watergate and uh - the CIA revelations, people have feel - have felt that they've uh been betrayed by public officials, I have to admit that in the uh - heat of the campaign - I've been in thirty primaries during the springtime, I've been campaigning for twenty-two months - I've made some mistakes.	1
ClaimBuster	20975	But I am somebody who believes that Roe versus Wade was rightly decided.	0
ClaimBuster	20976	Let's talk about the programs.	0
ClaimBuster	20977	Do you want jobs in the inner city?	0
ClaimBuster	20978	Now, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand.	0
ClaimBuster	20979	We were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983.	1
ClaimBuster	20980	But we had also better be darn sure we don't leave and make the situation worse, thereby exacerbating our reputation and our ability to address crises in other parts of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	20981	Two years ago, I warned that, because of the subprime lending mess, because of the lax regulation, that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time.	1
ClaimBuster	20982	I think the General Motors thing is very relevant.	0
ClaimBuster	20983	And third, is it even necessary for the President to be so intimately involved in strategic details?	0
ClaimBuster	20984	A President must know those things.	0
ClaimBuster	20985	And there is every evidence, every indication that that government would be hostile to the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	20986	Iran is bordered very extensively by the Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	20987	Not because I agreed with their ideology, but because I thought they were qualified and that elections have consequences when presidents are nominated.	0
ClaimBuster	20988	We busted the 4th largest army, and we did it through leadership.	1
ClaimBuster	20989	So let me try to answer you in this way.	0
ClaimBuster	20990	They're the fundamental aspect of America's economy.	0
ClaimBuster	20991	I have voted in the last uh - eight years uh - and the Vice President was uh - presiding over the Senate and meeting his other responsibilities.	1
ClaimBuster	20992	I mean, it's -- you know, and I've been saying at big speeches where I have 20,000 and 30,000 people, what do you have to lose?	1
ClaimBuster	20993	When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	20994	I do think that he inappropriately drew a comparison between what was happening there and what had happened during the civil rights movement, and we immediately put out a statement saying that we don't think that comparison is appropriate.	1
ClaimBuster	20995	That's something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don't get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.	1
ClaimBuster	20996	They are now 27.5 miles per gallon per automobile fleet.	1
ClaimBuster	20997	Last week I broke up -- I suspended campaigning for two days, or parts of two days, to go back and participate in the meetings that charted the President's summit meeting that he just returned from earlier today.	1
ClaimBuster	20998	I've been a person who has to set a clear vision and convince people to follow.	0
ClaimBuster	20999	I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them.	0
ClaimBuster	21000	You keep your own doctor.	1
ClaimBuster	21001	And if I'm elected president, I will do something about that.	0
ClaimBuster	21002	No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them.	0
ClaimBuster	21003	Of course, we're going to find Osama bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	21004	I ask you to allow me the privilege of leading this great nation of ours, of helping us to be stronger here at home and to be respected again in the world and, most of all, to be safer forever.	0
ClaimBuster	21005	He wants to give average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	21006	And it's a time for government to understand and to cooperate with our people.	0
ClaimBuster	21007	We've seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten.	1
ClaimBuster	21008	And those pessimists who say it can't be done, I'm sorry, I just have a fundamental disagreement with them	0
ClaimBuster	21009	Well, Governor Romney's right, you are familiar with jobs being shipped overseas because you invested in companies that were shipping jobs overseas.	1
ClaimBuster	21010	Now the Republican platform will cost more too.	0
ClaimBuster	21011	Like Jerry Brown, the 800 number.	1
ClaimBuster	21012	I must say that I think I have better opportunity, however, of finding the necessary funds to pay what, admittedly, will be very, very substantial sums of money.	0
ClaimBuster	21013	This is a president who has not met with the civil rights leadership of our country.	1
ClaimBuster	21014	Starting when they're 3 and going to this school until they're 9 and then going into the public school in the 4th grade.	0
ClaimBuster	21015	Now, what happened in July we've covered again and again and again.	1
ClaimBuster	21016	Your doctor chooses your prescription.	1
ClaimBuster	21017	The coalition against Saddam has fallen apart or it's unraveling, let's put it that way.	0
ClaimBuster	21018	It's not driven by members of Congress, and what they would like to see.	0
ClaimBuster	21019	I've kept the faith with my country.	0
ClaimBuster	21020	Today, 47 million people are on food stamps.	1
ClaimBuster	21021	And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles.	0
ClaimBuster	21022	And I'll tell you what, the Treasury should demand that money back and those executives should be fired.	0
ClaimBuster	21023	"""I said, ""OK, you've got a deal."	1
ClaimBuster	21024	I think it's whether you share the broad dreams of the American people, whether you have confidence in the people's ability to get things done or whether you think it all should be turned over, as many of the liberals do, to Washington, D.C. You see, I think it's a question of values, not likability or loveability, it's a question in foreign affairs in experience, knowing world leaders, knowing how to build on a superb record of this administration in arms control, because you'd know exactly how to begin.	0
ClaimBuster	21025	And secondly, to think that another round of resolutions would have caused Saddam Hussein to disarm, disclose, is ludicrous, in my judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	21026	There are some things I don't understand.	0
ClaimBuster	21027	And we are seeing a major offensive taking place -- Al Qaida and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion.	1
ClaimBuster	21028	It's a fundamental difference of opinion here, folks.	0
ClaimBuster	21029	In the first place, never go back to that Democratic grain embargo, that liberal Democrat grain embargo that knocked the markets right out from under us and made Mr. Gorbachev say to me when I was here, how do I know you're reliable suppliers?	1
ClaimBuster	21030	And if we had asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him.	0
ClaimBuster	21031	And I'm sorry, but demonstrating -- it's not a question of patriotism.	0
ClaimBuster	21032	"The president is the one that said, ""We can't allow countries to get nuclear weapons."""	1
ClaimBuster	21033	Over the last 5 years our income has grown more rapidly than the national average.	1
ClaimBuster	21034	At the same time, we have to be prepared.	0
ClaimBuster	21035	It's against the law in the United States to hire people illegally, and we ought to be enforcing that law properly.	1
ClaimBuster	21036	We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them.	1
ClaimBuster	21037	And you look at our miners.	0
ClaimBuster	21038	And I'll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	21039	$90 billion, that would have -- that would have hired 2 million teachers.	1
ClaimBuster	21040	I want to see more vouchers.	0
ClaimBuster	21041	And that means that there will be more industrial activity.	0
ClaimBuster	21042	You're running ads right now that say that I oppose federal funding for stem cell research.	1
ClaimBuster	21043	Let me start with how to control the cost of health care: medical liability reform, for starters, which he's opposed.	1
ClaimBuster	21044	So I would say our prestige is not so high.	0
ClaimBuster	21045	Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons and the world is more dangerous.	1
ClaimBuster	21046	We would like to see the Russians use that sway to encourage democracy to take hold.	0
ClaimBuster	21047	Did I get that right?	0
ClaimBuster	21048	We're a country that owes $20 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	21049	And even some in your own party couldn't buy that.	0
ClaimBuster	21050	We learned our lesson again in Korea, We must not learn it again.	0
ClaimBuster	21051	And the Congress by overriding the bills that I did veto, the Congress has added some $13 billion to the federal expenditures and to the federal deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	21052	We've got to clean this mess up, leave this country in good shape, and pass on the American dream to them.	0
ClaimBuster	21053	We ought to agree that somebody else should do it.	0
ClaimBuster	21054	We went out and built housing.	1
ClaimBuster	21055	Young folks saying I'm going to do something good for my country.	0
ClaimBuster	21056	It has imposed on the individual freedoms of the people, and there are more of these things that could be solved by the people themselves, if they were given a chance, or by the levels of government that were closer to them.	0
ClaimBuster	21057	Because the Soviet change is not fully established yet.	0
ClaimBuster	21058	One last point I should make.	0
ClaimBuster	21059	And that was the serious, serious threat.	0
ClaimBuster	21060	We have a duty to defeat this enemy.	0
ClaimBuster	21061	Now, we have allocated $750 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	21062	Mr. President, I accept your commitment to peace, but I want you to accept my commitment to a strong national defense.	0
ClaimBuster	21063	We're going to make America great.	0
ClaimBuster	21064	Fortunately, he has been during Democratic as well as Republican administrations.	1
ClaimBuster	21065	Well, it was very -- I say nothing.	0
ClaimBuster	21066	How about a line item veto?	0
ClaimBuster	21067	For example, in our State of Texas I worked with the legislature, both Republicans and Democrats, to pass a law that said if you come in the top 10% of your high school class, you're automatically admitted to one of our higher institutions of learning, college.	1
ClaimBuster	21068	The money stays within the Social Security system.	0
ClaimBuster	21069	-- and Glaspie's papers have been presented to the US Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	21070	We've got to show moral support for Georgia.	0
ClaimBuster	21071	We've had some disagreements about that.	1
ClaimBuster	21072	We now have five nations that have atomic bombs that we know about.	1
ClaimBuster	21073	This president has made, I regret to say, a colossal error of judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	21074	Number two, what's important is occasionally you've got to say no, to -- to -- to folks both in your own party and in the other party.	0
ClaimBuster	21075	Your question was on fairness.	0
ClaimBuster	21076	I don't admire Fidel Castro at all.	0
ClaimBuster	21077	Well, we all make mistakes.	0
ClaimBuster	21078	But I think, by improving productivity, they would be far less inflationary than the consumption-oriented tax cut that Governor Reagan is recommending.	0
ClaimBuster	21079	So for those reasons, for the tax, for Medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurance, this is why the American people don't want Medicare -- don't want Obamacare.	1
ClaimBuster	21080	How can we build a strong America militarily that's teeter-tottering on a mountain of debt?	0
ClaimBuster	21081	Governor Reagan, as a matter of fact, began his political career campaigning around this nation against Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	21082	Whether we're going to move a million people from welfare to work.	0
ClaimBuster	21083	But thank goodness we've always had enough people who have been willing in every generation to push past the fear of a broken heart and become deeply involved in forming a more perfect union.	0
ClaimBuster	21084	And we shifted people out of administrative jobs into the field to deliver better services.	1
ClaimBuster	21085	I believe that we should meet our commitments, and if the Chinese Communists attack the Pescadores and Formosa, they know that it will mean a war.	0
ClaimBuster	21086	The Senate has not voted yet on the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty.	1
ClaimBuster	21087	We have an opportunity, really, if you think about it, if we're smart and have got a strategic vision and a leader who understands strategic planning, to make sure that we change the terms of the battlefield of the future so we can keep the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	21088	As a matter of fact, during this current year uh we are shipping Iran, or have contracted to ship to Iran, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms and also to Saudi Arabia, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms.	1
ClaimBuster	21089	Those are all things that we put in the Democratic platform for the first time this year, and I think that's where we can find some common ground, because nobody's pro-abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	21090	So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.	0
ClaimBuster	21091	And that is the current campaign financing system.	0
ClaimBuster	21092	We must be very, very realistic in the nature of that leadership, but we must grind away and talk to find ways of reducing these differences, particularly where arms races are concerned and other dangerous exercises of Soviet power.	0
ClaimBuster	21093	Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment.	0
ClaimBuster	21094	But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary's leaving.	0
ClaimBuster	21095	And frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	21096	The war on terror is to make sure that these terrorist organizations do not end up with weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	21097	It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine-tenths billion dollar a year more than we're presently spending.	1
ClaimBuster	21098	When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what's happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we've made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	21099	I want to give a special thanks to my wife Elizabeth, my daughter Robin for their love and support, and thank the people who are listening and watching all over America.	0
ClaimBuster	21100	That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.	0
ClaimBuster	21101	That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she -- frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.	0
ClaimBuster	21102	And our best days are ahead of us.	0
ClaimBuster	21103	No, I don't have an answer for everything.	0
ClaimBuster	21104	And therefore, when they have to try to purchase drugs they do so on their own, there's no kind of collective bargaining, no power of purchasing among seniors.	0
ClaimBuster	21105	I've had some arguments with him about the speed in which we might have lowered interest rates, but Governor Clinton, he talks about the reaction to the markets.	0
ClaimBuster	21106	We will meet our commitments to maintain the freedom and independence of West Berlin.	0
ClaimBuster	21107	And I believe President Bush and I both love our country equally.	0
ClaimBuster	21108	Social Security is structurally sound.	0
ClaimBuster	21109	By the way, North Korea, most repressive and brutal regime probably on Earth.	0
ClaimBuster	21110	We have to determine when our interests are involved, not the United Nations' interests.	0
ClaimBuster	21111	Senator Obama says that it has to be safe or disposable or something like that.	1
ClaimBuster	21112	But there are some things that government can do and some things they cannot do.	0
ClaimBuster	21113	I believe we ought to measure a lot, three, four, five, six, seven, eighth grade.	0
ClaimBuster	21114	I'm just talking about the 12.8 percent that he paid, and that's what's happening all over this country with wealthy Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	21115	This is the way the framers of the Constitution intended our government to be, a government that comes from the people.	0
ClaimBuster	21116	Well, if you'll turn on the television, as I -- I watched the Arizona Cardinals defeat the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday.	1
ClaimBuster	21117	But I think in terms of the recession, of course you feel it when you're president of the US.	0
ClaimBuster	21118	I volunteered for the Army.	1
ClaimBuster	21119	It also means that we can target things easier and move more quickly, which means we need to be lighter and quicker and more facile and highly trained.	0
ClaimBuster	21120	I am a firm believer that our America 2000 education problem is the answer--a little longer run; it's going to take awhile to educate.	0
ClaimBuster	21121	I don't want to go down the path to Spain.	0
ClaimBuster	21122	And while he's been diverted, with 9 out of 10 active duty divisions of our Army, either going to Iraq, coming back from Iraq, or getting ready to go, North Korea's gotten nuclear weapons and the world is more dangerous.	1
ClaimBuster	21123	If you can't get your act together to pick him up one day when a Panamanian major has kidnapped him and a special forces team is 400 yards away and it's a stroll across the park to get him, and if you can't get your act together, at least pick up the Panamanian major, who they then killed, step up to the plate and admit it was a mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	21124	All of these things suggested, I think, to the Iranian mullahs that, hey, you know, we can keep on pushing along here, we can keep talks going on, we're just going to keep on spinning centrifuges.	0
ClaimBuster	21125	To the American people, I'm doing this because I love you.	0
ClaimBuster	21126	There are all these studies out there.	0
ClaimBuster	21127	You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore...	1
ClaimBuster	21128	And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did.	0
ClaimBuster	21129	The Commander-in-Chief was organizing demonstrations halfway around the world during another era.	1
ClaimBuster	21130	And I've been the chief executive officer of the second biggest state in the union.	1
ClaimBuster	21131	Obviously, I disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to Russians going into Georgia.	1
ClaimBuster	21132	The best expression of my family values is that tonight's my 17th wedding anniversary, and I'd like to close my question by just wishing my wife a happy anniversary, and thank you, my daughter, for being here.	1
ClaimBuster	21133	We've done a lot of hard work together over the last three and a half years.	0
ClaimBuster	21134	They'll be able to compete.	0
ClaimBuster	21135	Finally, to you students up there -- God bless you, I'm doing this for you: I want you to have the American dream.	0
ClaimBuster	21136	I think that would be a mistake, because I think one of the ways we've been able to be so successful in Kosovo and Bosnia and Haiti and in other places is by having the technological edge.	0
ClaimBuster	21137	He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote with him and lost by one vote.	1
ClaimBuster	21138	So you got to have a judicial intervention.	0
ClaimBuster	21139	While I was governor, I was proud that our fourth graders came out number one of all 50 states in English, and then also in math.	1
ClaimBuster	21140	A free Iraq will enforce the hopes and aspirations of the reformers in places like Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	21141	It's probably $5 trillion that we can't bring into our country, Lester.	1
ClaimBuster	21142	I've been fighting for changes in the exclusionary rule so if an honest cop stops somebody and makes a technical mistake, the criminal doesn't go away.	0
ClaimBuster	21143	But my strategy is broader than that.	0
ClaimBuster	21144	I've actually passed 56 individual bills that I've personally written and, in addition to that, and not always under my name, there is amendments on certain bills.	1
ClaimBuster	21145	And I assume some of those are because of our trading partners.	0
ClaimBuster	21146	I called upon the Congress not to hamstring the administration, and in terms of forcing troop withdrawals on a timetable that wasn't necessarily in our best interest or fit our nation's strategy, and so I think it's good public policy, I think it worked, and I'm pleased I took -- made the decision I made.	0
ClaimBuster	21147	And one thing we have to do: Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.	0
ClaimBuster	21148	Well, I think that, given what's happened over the last several weeks and months, our entire Russian approach has to be evaluated, because a resurgent and very aggressive Russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the region.	0
ClaimBuster	21149	Because we disagree very fundamentally on the position of the United States, and if his view prevails then I think that's going to bring an important result to this country in the sixties.	0
ClaimBuster	21150	Number two, John McCain and I have a proposal, jointly, for a commission that closes corporate giveaway loopholes.	1
ClaimBuster	21151	spending - we can afford the tax cuts I have proposed and probably mainly because Mr. Carter's economic policy has built into the next five years, and on beyond that, a tax increase that will be taking $86 billion more out of the people's pockets than was taken this year.	0
ClaimBuster	21152	We had a legitimate difference, and I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	21153	We wanted to end the bloodshed in southern Africa.	0
ClaimBuster	21154	And here's what we can do.	0
ClaimBuster	21155	I just -- I think there has been -- some of the scientists, I believe, Mr. Vice President, haven't they been changing their opinion a little bit on global warming?	0
ClaimBuster	21156	Secondly, he has mentioned the problem of our older citizens.	1
ClaimBuster	21157	We've got to fix our health care system and we've got to invest in our education system for every young person to be able to learn.	0
ClaimBuster	21158	Our country has tremendous problems.	0
ClaimBuster	21159	Is it -- is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them?	0
ClaimBuster	21160	And we're not going to be able to deal with the climate crisis if our only solution is to use more fossil fuels that create global warming.	0
ClaimBuster	21161	Pharmaceuticals were using loopholes to keep brand -- brand drugs in place, and generics are much less expensive than brand drugs.	1
ClaimBuster	21162	That, I think, in addition, would be an anti-inflationary measure that would strengthen the economy of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	21163	Well, I've been a senator, Donald...	1
ClaimBuster	21164	And unfortunately, that's the kind of opinions that you've offered throughout this campaign, and it is not a recipe for American strength, or keeping America safe over the long haul.	0
ClaimBuster	21165	I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	21166	28 years ago, as a young man just graduated from law school, I came to this city, came clear across the country, to watch John Kennedy be nominated for the presidency of the United States, right here in Los Angeles.	1
ClaimBuster	21167	And I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it's the same plan.	1
ClaimBuster	21168	That is a red line for us, because not only is Israel's security at stake, but our security is at stake if that unravels.	0
ClaimBuster	21169	Did we have any allies helping?	0
ClaimBuster	21170	I come from West Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	21171	And we're not doing what we ought to do in terms of the technology.	0
ClaimBuster	21172	And I would just like to say that this debate in a way is a living tribute to Mel Carnahan because he loved the vigorous discussion of ideas in our democracy.	1
ClaimBuster	21173	African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities.	1
ClaimBuster	21174	If you have a heart problem, you don't wait till a heart attack to address it.	0
ClaimBuster	21175	The federal government spends seven percent of the total on education, and the rest of the state governments and local governments and the thousand points of lightened I'm talking about private schools and private church schools and things of this nature--are putting up 93 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	21176	Now I think we have a selective engagement policy.	0
ClaimBuster	21177	For instance, if the Arab countries ever again declare an embargo against our nation on oil I would consider that not a military but an economic declaration of war, and I would respond instantly and in kind.	0
ClaimBuster	21178	And we have serious problems with our conventional forces at the present time, and they'll get worse unless we have a president who is willing to make some of these decisions.	0
NewsClaims	21179	Barely 1 month after Chinese health authorities reported the first cases of a mysterious new pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, the world may be on the cusp of a new pandemic.	1
NewsClaims	21180	A team led by Shi Zheng-Li of the Wuhan Institute of Virology reported on 23 January that 2019-nCoV's sequence was 96.2% identical to that of a bat coronavirus and 79.5% identical to the SARS coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	21181	From the start, the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan—which sold mammals as well as fish—was considered a likely source of the outbreak because most of the early patients had visited it.	1
NewsClaims	21182	The first known patient became ill on 1 December 2019 and had no links to the market, according to a paper published by Chinese researchers in The Lancet on 24 January that offered details about the first 41 patients in Wuhan.	1
NewsClaims	21183	Using these differences and presumed mutation rates, several groups have calculated that the virus began to spread around mid-November 2019—which supports the thesis that spread may have occurred before any of the cases linked to the market.	1
NewsClaims	21184	One group put the origin of the outbreak as early as 18 September 2019.	1
NewsClaims	21185	“Now it seems clear that [the] seafood market is not the only origin of the virus,” he wrote in an email to Science.	1
NewsClaims	21186	The duo targets the protease enzyme used by HIV to copy itself, and it might thwart the coronavirus's protease as well.	1
NewsClaims	21187	U.S. biotech Regeneron is trying to identify monoclonal antibodies effective against 2019-nCoV, as it did previously for MERS and Ebola.	1
NewsClaims	21188	Asked about the reports, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said: “There are no known effective therapeutics against this 2019-nCoV (virus) and the WHO recommends enrolment into a randomized controlled trial to test efficacy and safety.”	1
NewsClaims	21189	The U.S. drugmaker Gilead says it has started clinical trials of patients in China infected with the new coronavirus, using an experimental drug called remdesivir, but stressed that this work is investigational at this stage.	1
NewsClaims	21190	Heat is key to killing coronavirus on surfaces	1
NewsClaims	21191	"""If you wash and dry a cloth face mask on high heat, then you should be good to go,"" according to professor Travis Glenn."	1
NewsClaims	21192	For decontamination of packages and masks, the warmer the better	1
NewsClaims	21193	Heat is key to killing coronavirus, said Travis Glenn, professor of environmental health science at the University of Georgia College of Public Health.	1
NewsClaims	21194	"""Coronavirus lives a few days on many surfaces at room temperature, but it dies far faster at higher temperatures."	1
NewsClaims	21195	"It will also live a lot longer if the temperatures are low,"" said Glenn."	1
NewsClaims	21196	"""Storing packages in a cold garage is not likely to reduce coronavirus on or in those packages."""	1
NewsClaims	21197	Storing delivery boxes in the garage for a few days to allow any possible coronavirus contamination to die off was Glenn’s sister’s strategy.	1
NewsClaims	21198	Heat can also be wielded as a tool, said Glenn.	1
NewsClaims	21199	"""If you heat a material up to 130 degrees F, which is the high setting on a dryer or a very low oven setting, you only need about 20 minutes to kill greater than 99.99% of the virus,"" said Glenn."	1
NewsClaims	21200	"""If you’re heating up to 150 degrees F or higher, then you only need about five minutes to kill greater than 99.99%."""	1
NewsClaims	21201	While it’s not practical to toss an Amazon package or a meal kit delivery in an oven or dryer, it could be a very effective way to disinfect face masks.	1
NewsClaims	21202	"""If you wash and dry a cloth face mask on high heat, then you should be good to go,"" said Glenn, and you may be able to disinfect a cloth mask just by running it through a hot dryer cycle."	1
NewsClaims	21203	"""More testing needs to be done, but we know that the warmer you make it, the less time it takes for the virus to die,"" said Glenn."	1
NewsClaims	21204	"So, you can either rotate two masks, leaving one in the car while you shop, or just leave your mask in your car when you get home, as long as you’re parking someplace warm."""	1
NewsClaims	21205	This may be welcome news for health care and essential retail workers who wear masks daily and may need a faster or more convenient way to disinfect between uses.	1
NewsClaims	21206	Intravenous vitamin C is a safe broad-spectrum antiviral used to effectively treat, cure, or prevent contraction of coronavirus according to many Chinese doctors.	1
NewsClaims	21207	High-dose vitamin C can not only improve antiviral levels but can also prevent and treat acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress (ARDS) related to COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	21208	Federal health agencies and veterinary experts have said since the beginning of the pandemic that pets are unlikely to pose a significant risk to people.	1
NewsClaims	21209	"What’s more, Sykes notes there have been multiple reports of households where one pet tested positive and others didn’t. ""Everything we’ve learned so far suggests that it’s unlikely that pets are a significant source of transmission,"" she says."	1
NewsClaims	21210	Indeed, pets are much more likely to get the virus from humans than the other way around.	1
NewsClaims	21211	Still, most researchers think pets pose little risk to people—and to other pets as well.	1
NewsClaims	21212	A few studies have shown that cats can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to other cats, but all were conducted in an artificial laboratory setting.	1
NewsClaims	21213	Hard evidence from controlled studies for this assertion was lacking—and still is—but everything scientists have seen so far suggests cats and dogs are highly unlikely to pass SARS-CoV-2 to humans.	1
NewsClaims	21214	That could give scientists a better sense of how likely pets are to transmit the virus to other pets, how long pets remain contagious, and what—if any—clinical signs of COVID-19 show up.	1
NewsClaims	21215	"And because there aren’t any drugs for the disease, he says, ""We wouldn’t prescribe anything"" for the pet."	1
NewsClaims	21216	Because pet testing remains rare, it’s unclear how many cats and dogs have been infected with SARS-CoV-2.	1
NewsClaims	21217	A genetic study of the viral sequences in the first two dogs known to have COVID-19 indicates they caught it from their owners.	1
NewsClaims	21218	But some researchers caution that this finding may be due in part to limited testing: Most of the pets that have been evaluated got the tests because they lived with humans who had already tested positive.	1
NewsClaims	21219	Myth #1: Cold weather kills the novel coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	21220	Truth: The CDC and the WHO have said this from the start: the most effective way to protect yourself from COVID-19 is with frequent handwashing with soap and water, or using hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol.	1
NewsClaims	21221	The WHO says there is “no reason to believe cold weather can kill the new coronavirus,” or other diseases, for that matter.	1
NewsClaims	21222	Myth #2: COVID-19 cannot be transmitted in hotter, more humid climates	1
NewsClaims	21223	Myth #3: Taking a hot bath prevents you from getting COVID-19	1
NewsClaims	21224	Truth: This myth has been stemming from the false idea that cold and hot temperatures can kill the virus.	1
NewsClaims	21225	Myth #4: Coronavirus can be transmitted through mosquito bites	1
NewsClaims	21226	From the WHO, “there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes.” This is because the new coronavirus is spread primarily through droplets when someone with the coronavirus sneezes or coughs.	1
NewsClaims	21227	Myth #5: Hand dryers are effective in killing the new coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	21228	Truth: The heat from a hand dryer alone is not enough to kill the new coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	21229	Myth #6: UV lamps kill the new coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	21230	Truth: It’s too soon to tell whether UV light is an effective way to kill the new coronavirus, and the World Health Organization does not suggest its use.	1
NewsClaims	21231	Myth #8: Spraying alcohol and chlorine all over yourself kills the coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	21232	Truth: This will not cure you of COVID-19 if it has already entered your body.	1
NewsClaims	21233	The World Health Organization says they both can be used to disinfect surfaces, however.	1
NewsClaims	21234	Myth #9: Getting a pneumonia vaccine protects against COVID-19	1
NewsClaims	21235	Truth: The WHO says, “vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.” COVID-19 is a respiratory infection, yes, but it requires its own vaccine, which is in the testing phase right now.	1
NewsClaims	21236	Myth #10: Rinsing your nose, and gargling, with saline solution helps prevent COVID-19 infection	1
NewsClaims	21237	But this does not apply to COVID-19, and other respiratory infections.	1
NewsClaims	21238	Myth #11: Eating garlic helps prevent COVID-19 infection	1
NewsClaims	21239	Truth: There is no scientific evidence that eating garlic prevents you from being infected with the novel coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	21240	The best ways are frequent hand washing, the use of hand sanitizer, and social distancing.	1
NewsClaims	21241	Myth #13: Antibiotics prevent and treat COVID-19	1
NewsClaims	21242	Truth: Antibiotics are used to fight bacteria, not viruses, which is what COVID-19 is.	1
NewsClaims	21243	The antibiotic does not treat the virus itself.	1
NewsClaims	21244	Myth #14: There are medicines to prevent and treat coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	21245	Right now, there is no medication recommended to prevent or treat COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	21246	"Biological Weapon"", ""Sputnik: Coronavirus Could be Designed to Kill Elderly Italians"", ""Arab Writers: The Coronavirus Is Part Of Biological Warfare Waged By The U.S. Against China"", ""Iran Cleric Blames Trump For Coronavirus Outbreak in Religious City"", ""Coronavirus: Iran's deputy health minister rejects biological warfare theory"", ""Coronavirus: Misinformation and false medical advice spreads in Iran"", ""Civil Defense Chief: Coronavirus Likely Biological Attack against China, Iran"", ""Virus is biological attack on China and Iran, Iranian civil defense chief claims"", ""Coronavirus may be US 'biological attack': IRGC head Hossein Salami"", ""The Lie that Triggered Khamenei's 'Biological Attack' Conspiracy Theory"", ""Prophet's perfume and flower oil: how Islamic medicine has made Iran's Covid-19 outbreak worse"", ""Senior Iranian cleric who died from coronavirus blamed US for outbreak"", ""Marco Rubio: Russia, China and Iran are waging disinformation war over coronavirus"", ""Bioweapon conspiracy video creeps into Senate coronavirus hearing"", ""Constituyente Elvis Méndez: ""El coronavirus lo inocularon los gringos, ""Why Coronavirus Conspiracy Theories Flourish."	1
NewsClaims	21247	"[324][325], Social media posts and internet memes claimed that COVID-19 derives from ""Chinese Originated Viral Infectious Disease 19"", or similar, as supposedly the ""19th virus to come out of China""."	1
NewsClaims	21248	[25] The conspiracy theory spread widely on social media, but subsequent scientific investigation showed that the virus originated in bats.	1
NewsClaims	21249	[48], On 22 February, US officials alleged that Russia is behind an ongoing disinformation campaign, using thousands of social media accounts on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to deliberately promote unfounded conspiracy theories, claiming the virus is a biological weapon manufactured by the CIA and the US is waging economic war on China using the virus.	1
NewsClaims	21250	"[f], Iran's Press TV asserted that ""Zionist elements developed a deadlier strain of coronavirus against Iran""."	1
NewsClaims	21251	He said Iran was hard-hit because its close ties to China and reluctance to cut air ties introduced the virus, and because early cases had been mistaken for influenza.	1
NewsClaims	21252	It is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation of a related SARS-CoV-like coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	21253	Given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to bat SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses2, it is likely that bats serve as reservoir hosts for its progenitor.	1
NewsClaims	21254	“It’s actually a respiratory virus,” Lavin says, meaning that the virus is transmitted via tiny droplets of spit and mucus that may be expelled when coughing and sneezing.	1
NewsClaims	21255	However, it’s not believed that it’s transmitted by water,” Lavin says.	1
NewsClaims	21256	“The good news is that the average amount of chlorine that’s in a pool is going to kill the virus,” Lavin says.	1
NewsClaims	21257	The CDC reported on March 10 that “there is no evidence that COVID-19 can be spread to humans through the use of pools and hot tubs.	1
NewsClaims	21258	Proper operation, maintenance, and disinfection (e.g., with chlorine and bromine) of pools and hot tubs should remove or inactivate the virus that causes COVID-19.”	1
NewsClaims	21259	Though the risk of transmission from surfaces is relatively low, especially if you’re practicing good hand-washing hygiene, the bigger concern is the people you’ll meet at the pool.	1
NewsClaims	21260	Wash your hands frequently, particularly after you’ve been in a public space or after blowing your nose, sneezing, or coughing.	1
NewsClaims	21261	If soap is not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol.	1
NewsClaims	21262	The novel coronavirus likely originated in bats, but the pathogen may have then hopped into dogs before infecting humans, a new study suggests.	1
NewsClaims	21263	"""This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may have evolved in a new host (or new host tissue) with high ZAP expression,"" which would place evolutionary pressure on the virus to shed CpG sites, Xia wrote."	1
NewsClaims	21264	This is another conspiracy theory about the 2019-nCoV coronavirus, based on recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about biological weapons and the Lugar Lab in Georgia.	1
NewsClaims	21265	"A group of 27 prominent public health scientists, from nine countries, wrote a statement published online by the Lancet, that ""strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin"", and they “overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife,” just like many other viruses that have recently emerged in humans."	1
NewsClaims	21266	Breaking news: China will admit coronavirus coming from its P4 lab	1
NewsClaims	21267	Last updated on Feb 3, 2020: Miles Guo identified the Chinese scientist “Deyin Guo” to be the person who created the Wuhan Coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	21268	Now the Chinese Communist Party is blaming the U.S. for creating Wuhan coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	21269	The Chinese Communist Party will finally admit that the real source of the coronavirus is from “a lab in Wuhan” linked to its covert biological weapon programs.	1
NewsClaims	21270	As the “novel” coronavirus originated in Wuhan is spreading to ten countries, more and more people including international bio-weapon experts are questioning its link to the Wuhan P4 lab located about 20 miles from a seafood market where the first few cases of human infections were found.	1
NewsClaims	21271	A reliable source, one of the Chinese kleptocrats, told Miles Guo today that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) will admit to the public of an “accidental” leak of lab-created virus from a P4 lab in Wuhan to put blames on “human errors”.	1
NewsClaims	21272	A recent case report from a team of UK investigators at the University of Cambridge and Barts Health has found that remdesivir is likely to be a highly effective antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2.	1
NewsClaims	21273	"""The dramatic response to the drug - on repeated challenge - suggests that it can be a highly effective treatment, at least for some patients."""	1
NewsClaims	21274	The problem was its inclusion in a list of medications - known as the covid kit - which, although they have no proven effectiveness in treating Covid-19, was advocated by politicians as a solution to the disease.	1
NewsClaims	21275	According to the company, there is no data that support the effectiveness of the drug against Covid-19.	1
NewsClaims	21276	[2] Several religious groups have claimed their faith will protect them from the virus.	1
NewsClaims	21277	[3] Without evidence, some people have claimed the virus is a bioweapon accidentally or purposefully leaked from a laboratory, a population control scheme, the result of a spy operation, or the side effect of 5G upgrades to cellular networks.	1
NewsClaims	21278	It is thought by most virologists that the SARS-CoV-2 virus originated in bats, and transferred to humans via a spillover event, possibly involving another intermediate animal host.	1
NewsClaims	21279	The Pew Research Center found, for example, that one in three Americans believed the new coronavirus had been created in a lab; one in four thought it had been engineered intentionally.	1
NewsClaims	21280	Though the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has not been determined, unfounded speculation and conspiracy theories regarding the possibility the SARS-CoV-2 virus originated in the Wuhan Institute of Virology have gained popularity during the pandemic.	1
NewsClaims	21281	"[28][26][24][29] Despite much speculation on the Internet, ""lab"" related theories are not supported by scientific evidence."	1
NewsClaims	21282	Although early clinical tests are underway, today there is no vaccine.	1
NewsClaims	21283	On March 12th, 2020, Anderson Cooper and Dr. Sanjay Gupta held a global town hall on “Corona Facts and Fears.” During the discussion, Anderson said to the viewing audience, “And, again, if you are concerned about coronavirus, and you haven’t gotten a flu shot…you should get a flu shot.”	1
NewsClaims	21284	In searching the literature, the only study we have been able to find assessing flu shots and coronavirus is a 2020 US Pentagon study that found that the flu shot INCREASES the risks from coronavirus by 36%.	1
NewsClaims	21285	"), one thing in particular is certainly not helping anyone: Claims that it somehow originated with one woman eating something people are referring to as ""bat soup."""	1
NewsClaims	21286	Initially, this novel coronavirus was believed to have started in a large seafood or wet market, suggesting animal-to-person spread, according to the CDC.	1
NewsClaims	21287	Is it possible that the novel coronavirus began with an infected animal at the market—and then went on to person-to-person transmission once people were infected?	1
NewsClaims	21288	“By comparing the available genome sequence data for known coronavirus strains, we can firmly determine that SARS-CoV-2 originated through natural processes,” Kristian Andersen, PhD, an associate professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research and corresponding author on the paper, said in a statement.	1
NewsClaims	21289	There is no evidence to back up this rumor, which has circulated on the internet.	1
NewsClaims	21290	In response to the outbreak of the corona virus the Chinese authorities have placed more than a dozen cities under quarantine.	1
NewsClaims	21291	The coronavirus 2019-nCoV is a biological weapon developed by the British, even if they pursued scientific goals.	1
NewsClaims	21292	"So, molecular biologists saw structural details similar to the 2019-nCoV on the electron microscope image of the ""British invention""."	1
NewsClaims	21293	There is no evidence to suggest it was developed artificially as a weapon of mass destruction.	1
NewsClaims	21294	Based on our findings we believe this therapeutic approach has the potential to significantly impact the high morbidity and mortality of coronavirus-infected patients and patients infected with other respiratory pathogens.	1
NewsClaims	21295	The president was roundly criticized for pondering whether or not UV light or other disinfectants that have proved effective at killing the Wuhan coronavirus on surfaces could somehow be administered inside the body to treat patients suffering from the disease.	1

NewsClaims	21300	During Thursday's coronavirus task force briefing, President Trump asked White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx whether sunlight has been explored as a possible treatment for those suffering from disease, specifically the coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	21301	MacCleery noted during her testimony that the National Institutes of Health says there is no evidence for silver supplements to prevent or treat any condition.	1
NewsClaims	21302	"""On a recent episode of Mercola's podcast, he actually advises consumers to take the immunity-boosting supplements he sells and then attempt to contract the COVID-19 virus deliberately because his supplements will allegedly reduce their symptoms."	1
NewsClaims	21303	The most striking new claim in recent days, ahead of Biden’s announcement, was in the Wall Street Journal, which reported that US intelligence agencies were told that three unnamed staff at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) were sick enough to go hospital in November 2019 with symptoms that might have been coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	21304	Biden also revealed that two of the 18 US intelligence agencies lean towards the theory it jumped from an animal species to humans and “one leans more toward” the lab theory, suggesting a striking lack of clarity.	1
NewsClaims	21305	Meanwhile, outside of US intelligence circles, the broad consensus among scientific experts remains that the most likely explanation is that Covid-19 jumped to humans from an animal host in a natural event.	1
NewsClaims	21306	The experience of Sars and Mers suggests that coronaviruses do break out naturally and that understanding their origins is difficult.	1
NewsClaims	21307	Remdesivir Is Not An Effective Treatment For COVID-19, WHO Says	1
NewsClaims	21308	"The panel analyzed remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir-ritonavir used on hospitalized COVID-19 patients and wrote that ""the role of these drugs in clinical practice has remained uncertain."""	1
NewsClaims	21309	The World Health Organization is advising against using the antiviral drug remdesivir as a COVID-19 treatment, citing that there is no evidence of the drug improving patients’ recovery.	1
NewsClaims	21310	The company said the promising vaccine was shown to be 95% effective at preventing COVID-19 in clinical trials.	1
NewsClaims	21311	While there is so far no evidence being offered to support this suggestion, the fact that the mere possibility is being reported in mainstream media outlets like the Washington Post and Yahoo News might seem to give credence to earlier conspiracy theories about the virus being engineered in a biowarfare laboratory and deliberately released into the human population.	1
NewsClaims	21312	Whether the virus first infected humans at the infamous Wuhan “wet market” or somehow took a more complicated route via a so far unidentified Chinese laboratory, the ultimate source of the novel coronavirus is still the same: wild populations of bats.	1
NewsClaims	21313	None of the current speculation changes the one fact that is established beyond reasonable doubt — SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic virus, meaning it came from an animal and jumped into the human population.	1
NewsClaims	21314	Indeed, it is thanks to their work that we know that SARS-CoV-2 is 96 percent “identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus” (to quote from a Feb. 3 Nature paper co-authored by the institute’s scientists) and that its most likely original host is the horseshoe bat.	1
NewsClaims	21315	An investigation by the United States military into the origins of the virus, while noting the high degree of “speculation and rumor” around the issue, concurred that “the weight of evidence seems to indicate ‘natural.	1
NewsClaims	21316	In the Nature Medicine paper, the scientists reach the definitive conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 is “the product of natural evolution,” Golding added, “ending any speculation about deliberate genetic engineering.”	1
NewsClaims	21317	As the NYT reported, Pottinger and colleagues urged the CIA and other agencies to search for evidence that might “bolster his theory” that the “virus may have originated in one of the laboratories in Wuhan studying deadly pathogens” — even though “they didn’t have any evidence” to support such a contention.	1
NewsClaims	21318	This “Wuhan Virus” insult infuriated Beijing, leading one Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson to spin his own retaliatory conspiracy theory about the origins of COVID-19 — that it was brought to China by the US military.	1
NewsClaims	21319	Despite these competing geopolitical conspiracy theories, the most likely explanation about the origins of COVID-19 remains the original one: that the virus first spread into the human population of Wuhan from an animal at the city’s notorious “wet market.”	1
NewsClaims	21320	While bats are consumed in China and may have been sold in the Wuhan wet market, it seems unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 jumped directly to people from wild bats.	1
NewsClaims	21321	An “intermediate host” was probably involved in the virus’s evolution into a form more adapted to humans.	1
NewsClaims	21322	A frenzy of speculation has arisen around the idea that the novel coronavirus responsible for the global COVID-19 pandemic might originally have escaped from a laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan.	1
NewsClaims	21323	Scientists writing in Nature Medicine journal on March 17 made clear that “all notable SARS-CoV-2 features” were also observed “in related coronaviruses in nature” and that therefore “we do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible.”	1
NewsClaims	21324	Currently pangolin — a scaly mammal endangered in the wild but often sold in Chinese markets — is the leading contender.	1
NewsClaims	21325	Facebook Messenger video falsely claims hot lemon juice can kill the coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	21326	On its website, the World Health Organization says that, while it recommends eating plenty of fruits and vegetables to stay healthy, there is no scientific evidence that lemon treats or prevents COVID-19 infection.	1
NewsClaims	21327	A video being passed around on Facebook Messenger claims that curing the novel coronavirus is as easy as drinking hot lemon juice.	1
NewsClaims	21328	Second, there is no evidence that vitamin C is effective against COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	21329	"The hot lemon can kill the proliferation of this virus in our bodies!"""	1

NewsClaims	21333	The study showed no evidence that hydroxychloroquine prevented death or helped patients recover from COVID-19 more quickly.	1
NewsClaims	21334	Myth: Coronavirus is man-made	1
NewsClaims	21335	As the coronavirus outbreak turned into a full-fledged public health crisis, a fringe theory about the virus' origins started to take hold on the internet: that the virus didn't come from nature, but had instead been created in a lab.	1
NewsClaims	21336	One version popularized outside China suggested that a Chinese lab had been secretly working on a bioweapon that got leaked.	1
NewsClaims	21337	Myth: Home remedies can cure or prevent the virus	1
NewsClaims	21338	And vitamin C. But despite what some corners of social media would have you believe, there's no evidence from the outbreak that eating garlic, sipping water every 15 minutes or taking vitamin C will protect people from the new coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	21339	Some posts have suggested that putting sesame oil on your body or spraying yourself with alcohol or chlorine will kill the virus.	1
NewsClaims	21340	That's also false.	1
NewsClaims	21341	Same goes for using essential oils, colloidal silver and steroids.	1
NewsClaims	21342	There are some chemical disinfectants , including bleach, 75% ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform, that may kill the virus on surfaces.	1

NewsClaims	21349	Getting a letter or package from China won't put you at risk of contracting the virus, according to WHO	1
NewsClaims	21350	Taken together, our findings plus the evidence to date suggest that azithromycin is not a sufficiently effective treatment to justify routine use for treatment of COVID-19, neither in the community nor in hospitals.	1
NewsClaims	21351	Additionally, there was an aim to cast doubt on the virus’ origins in China and demonstrate China’s support for multilateral efforts to combat its spread.	1
NewsClaims	21352	Some small studies have demonstrated the potential for convalescent plasma in treating COVID-19 patients, but there are also some contradictory studies as well.	1
NewsClaims	21353	First reported by The New York Times, the hold was placed after senior U.S. public health policy officials in charge of the national COVID-19 response, including National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci and Clifford Lane, NIAID deputy director, argued the emerging data was not strong enough to support approval under EUA.	1
NewsClaims	21354	In March, the FDA created a pathway with strict guidelines for physicians to use convalescent plasma on seriously ill COVID-19 patients.	1
NewsClaims	21355	In July, the National Institute of Health updated its treatment guidelines which suggest there is “insufficient data” to support convalescent plasma as an approved treatment for COVID-19, CNBC said.	1
NewsClaims	21356	It cannot be said that the virus escaped from a P4 laboratory located in Wuhan, as the video claims	1
NewsClaims	21357	The AFP fact-checking cell had, for example, proved that the coronavirus detected in China had not been created in the laboratory and then patented, which the author of the video is careful not to specify.	1
NewsClaims	21358	Nothing proves that the virus is a creation of the man and more precisely of the French	1
NewsClaims	21359	The “patented” and “created by the French” coronavirus?	1
NewsClaims	21360	"On social networks, a new conspiratorial theory which circulates massively affirms that the coronavirus was created ""in laboratory"" and ""patented""."	1
NewsClaims	21361	"The author of the video over-interprets the term ""inventor"" which is used to designate the owners of the patent, and not the inventors of a potential virus."	1

NewsClaims	21371	PHOENIX – As the first wave of the pandemic picked up speed in Arizona in the spring of 2020, Juan and Rosa Aguirre heard that doctors in Mexico were prescribing a medicine thought to prevent and cure COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	21372	Medical experts contend there isn’t yet enough credible science to justify using ivermectin as an off-label prevention or treatment for COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	21373	"The ivermectin controversy gained heft in Arizona when a Wisconsin pulmonologist, Pierre Kory, told a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in December 2020 that mountains of data from around the world support ivermectin’s ""miraculous impact"" as a preventative and healing agent of COVID-19."	1
NewsClaims	21374	Still, Shah said, most studies purporting that ivermectin is safe and effective in treating COVID-19 patients lack scientific rigor.	1
NewsClaims	21375	Studies around the world, she said, provide evidence of the medicine’s efficacy in treating COVID-19 patients.	1
NewsClaims	21376	Does eating an alkaline diet prevent you from getting infected with the novel coronavirus?	1
NewsClaims	21377	No, that's not true: This claim is a medical myth saying that eating an alkaline diet could prevent someone from being infected with the coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	21378	On Facebook, dietician Julie Perk reiterated that the diet does not prevent coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	21379	NO, the Institut Pasteur did not create the SARS-CoV-2 virus and release it in the city of Wuhan to cause the pandemic and implicate the Chinese authorities	1
NewsClaims	21380	A scientific paper published on March 17, 2020 refutes the theory that a creation by a laboratory may be behind this emerging virus.	1
NewsClaims	21381	"See below ""There is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was created by humans""."	1
NewsClaims	21382	A scientific article published on March 17, 2020 disproved the idea that this virus resulted from a laboratory creation.	1
NewsClaims	21383	Coronaviruses are mainly transmitted from person to person via respiratory droplets, either by being inhaled or deposited on mucosal surfaces, including aerosols produced when coughing and speaking.	1
NewsClaims	21384	Transmission through contact with contaminated fomites is considered possible, although it has not yet been documented for SARS-CoV-2, and cultivable virus has not been detected in real-life situations [1,2].	1
NewsClaims	21385	Viral RNA has also been detected on rare occasions in blood specimens, but there is no evidence of transmission through contact with blood [3-5].	1
NewsClaims	21386	Research from the United Kingdom in September and October 2020 concluded that children, notably those between 12-16 years of age, played a significant role in introducing SARS-CoV-2 infection into households, coinciding with the timing of school reopenings [12].	1
NewsClaims	21387	It is therefore possible that the difference in observed attack rates by age was due to spousal contacts having higher risk of transmission compared to other contacts, rather than a true age-related difference; there appears to be a research gap in understanding transmission risk for child contacts and non-spouse adult contacts [11].	1
NewsClaims	21388	In educational settings, notably primary schools, where appropriate infection prevention and control measures are in place, SARS-CoV-2 transmission from children does not appear to occur very frequently [18-22].	1
NewsClaims	21389	There is evidence that there is an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to teachers when secondary schools are open.	1
NewsClaims	21390	It has been observed that the effect of school closures for reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission was small in the second wave compared to the first wave in Europe, suggesting that schools were able to operate more safely in the second wave through having implemented measures such as symptom screening, asymptomatic testing, contact tracing, sanitisation, ventilation, distancing, reducing group sizes and preventing the mixing of groups [24].	1
NewsClaims	21391	Nonetheless, in the third wave, widespread community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (with high transmissibility) increases the possibility of onward transmission in schools and subsequently household settings [17,25], particularly in the absence of appropriate in-school mitigation measures.	1
NewsClaims	21392	An age-structured modelling study from the Netherlands, based on the virus characteristics of previously dominant SARS-CoV-2 strains, concluded that the largest impact on community transmission was achieved by reducing contacts in secondary schools [29].	1
NewsClaims	21393	Several outbreak investigation reports have shown that COVID-19 transmission can be particularly effective in crowded, confined indoor spaces [31] .	1
NewsClaims	21394	Transmission can be linked with to specific activities, such as singing in a choir [32].	1
NewsClaims	21395	Poor ventilation in confined indoor spaces is associated with increased transmission of respiratory infections and COVID-19 in particular [33].	1
NewsClaims	21396	In a restaurant outbreak of 10 cases in three families in Guangzhou, China, transmission was attributed to the spread of respiratory droplets carrying SARS-CoV-2 by the airflow generated by the air-conditioning [34].	1
NewsClaims	21397	Similarly, two other outbreaks from China in January 2020 attribute air conditioning systems using a re-circulating mode as a likely aid to transmission [35].	1
NewsClaims	21398	Well-maintained, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems may have a complementary role in decreasing transmission in indoor spaces by increasing the rate of air change, decreasing recirculation of air and increasing the use of outdoor air [33]	1
NewsClaims	21399	Participating in meetings and sharing the same office space has been reported in literature as a risk factor for contracting COVID-19 [39,40].	1
NewsClaims	21400	canteen and dressing rooms), transport and accommodation may also contribute to transmission [42].	1
NewsClaims	21401	A systematic review and meta-analysis of 172 observational studies both in healthcare settings and the community, that looked into the effect of distance from the source patient and the use of respiratory and eye protection in the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, concluded that physical distancing of at least one metre, use of face masks and eye protection were associated with a much lower risk of transmission [49].	1
NewsClaims	21402	Medical professionals from the preeminent organizations on public health Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization have started changing their stance that COVID-19 is airborne.	1
NewsClaims	21403	Prior to this, doctors hypothesized that COVID-19 was transmitted by droplets larger than aerosols and primarily through contaminated surfaces.	1
NewsClaims	21404	Doctors are concerned with the dosage of droplets that leads to infection.	1
NewsClaims	21405	Detering Airborne Transmission with an Air Filter	1
NewsClaims	21406	Besides those physical barriers, another weapon to combat airborne transmission is an air filter.	1
NewsClaims	21407	An air filter can capture these small particles and trap them, limiting their spread.	1
NewsClaims	21408	MERV 16 filters capture up to 96% of virus-sized airborne particles and virus-sized airborne particles*.	1
NewsClaims	21409	The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-Conditioning Engineers recommends a minimum MERV rating of 13 to neutralize airborne viruses.	1
NewsClaims	21410	Filters are critical in helping capture those droplets circulating in the airstream.	1
NewsClaims	21411	They do not have a 100 percent success rate and virus-laden droplets can still circulate even with an air purifier.	1
NewsClaims	21412	Along with our precautionary measures, air filters do help in limiting the spread of airborne viruses whether it is a whole-home or portable system.	1
NewsClaims	21413	Social distancing, frequently washing hands and surfaces, shielding your mouth and nose with a mask, and installing an air purifier are the best methods to keep you and your family safe.	1

NewsClaims	21416	Coronavirus myths: viral nature of misinformation	1
NewsClaims	21417	SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by exposure to infectious respiratory fluids	1
NewsClaims	21418	The principal mode by which people are infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is through exposure to respiratory fluids carrying infectious virus.	1
NewsClaims	21419	People release respiratory fluids during exhalation (e.g., quiet breathing, speaking, singing, exercise, coughing, sneezing) in the form of droplets across a spectrum of sizes.1-9 These droplets carry virus and transmit infection.	1
NewsClaims	21420	Risk of transmission is likewise greatest close to an infectious source where the concentration of these exhaled droplets and particles is greatest.	1
NewsClaims	21421	Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from inhalation of virus in the air farther than six feet from an infectious source can occur	1
NewsClaims	21422	Although infections through inhalation at distances greater than six feet from an infectious source are less likely than at closer distances, the phenomenon has been repeatedly documented under certain preventable circumstances.10-21 These transmission events have involved the presence of an infectious person exhaling virus indoors for an extended time (more than 15 minutes and in some cases hours) leading to virus concentrations in the air space sufficient to transmit infections to people more than 6 feet away, and in some cases to people who have passed through that space soon after the infectious person left.	1
NewsClaims	21423	Current evidence strongly suggests transmission from contaminated surfaces does not contribute substantially to new infections.	1
NewsClaims	21424	Transmission through soiled hands and surfaces can be prevented by practicing good hand hygiene and by environmental cleaning.	1
NewsClaims	21425	A Peruvian criminal court recently issued an order accusing Bill Gates, George Soros and the Rockefeller family of creating the COVID-19 virus.	1

NewsClaims	21440	Kremlin-backed media has broadcast propaganda which states Covid-19, the new form of coronavirus, was created as a tool for the benefit of the UK.	1
NewsClaims	21441	EXCLUSIVE: Russian media blames BRITAIN for the coronavirus outbreak: Propaganda accuses UK of 'smearing something in Wuhan' and links the virus to Salisbury novichok attack	1
NewsClaims	21442	The British 'smeared something in Wuhan' in the same way that they 'smear[ed] nerve agent on Skripal's door handle';	1
NewsClaims	21443	'Maybe they smeared something in Wuhan, Hubei, too, such as an escalator hand rail on the subway – something thousands of people touch daily.'	1
NewsClaims	21444	Those who received PCV13 had a 35% lower incidence of COVID-19 diagnosis, 32% lower incidence of COVID-19 hospitalization and 32% lower incidence of COVID-19 death, the study showed.	1
NewsClaims	21445	In contrast, an alternative pneumococcal vaccine (PPSV23), which prevents severe pneumococcal disease was not associated with protection.	1
NewsClaims	21446	"""One of the most interesting aspects of our findings was that the patients who received PCV13 received some protection against COVID-19, while those who received PPSV23, another pneumococcal vaccine, did not."""	1
NewsClaims	21447	The genomic data cannot pinpoint the origin, but they do show that the jump from animals to humans happened recently, Koopmans says.	1
NewsClaims	21448	Development of entirely new treatments has started as well.	1
NewsClaims	21449	"""Now it seems clear that [the] seafood market is not the only origin of the virus,"" he wrote in an email to"	1
NewsClaims	21450	That doesn't mean 2019-nCoV jumped directly from bats to humans, says evolutionary biologist Kristian Andersen of Scripps Research.	1
NewsClaims	21451	Scientists don't know how long the incubation period lasts or whether infected people who show no symptoms can transmit the virus.	1
NewsClaims	21452	But by 28 January, several countries had reported local human-to-human transmission, which may change the equation.	1
NewsClaims	21453	"""Remdesivir has had activity against every coronavirus we've tested, and I'd be surprised if it didn't have activity against"" 2019-nCoV, says co-author Mark Denison, a virologist at Vanderbilt University."	1
NewsClaims	21454	The same study showed better outcomes for remdesivir, an experimental drug made by Gilead and previously tested against Ebola that interferes with the viral polymerase enzyme.	1
NewsClaims	21455	In meetings on 22 and 23 January, a special WHO committee that includes Koopmans was divided on whether a PHEIC was warranted, in part because there was no evidence the disease was spreading between people outside of China.	1
NewsClaims	21456	"China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported on 26 January that a seemingly healthy man appeared to have infected ""a few colleagues."""	1
NewsClaims	21457	That indicates the market played a role in spreading the virus, says Daniel Lucey, an infectious disease specialist at Georgetown University—but he says other data suggest it wasn't the origin.	1
NewsClaims	21458	"""But to be honest, we still do not know where the virus came from now."""	1
NewsClaims	21459	The duo targets the protease enzyme used by HIV to copy itself, and it might thwart the coronavirus's protease as well.	1
NewsClaims	21460	Lucey contends the virus was already circulating silently among humans before it contaminated the seafood market, possibly by infected animals, humans, or both.	1
NewsClaims	21461	From the start, the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan—which sold mammals as well as fish—was considered a likely source of the outbreak because most of the early patients had visited it.	1
NewsClaims	21462	Almost certainly from animals, but when and how are mysteries.	1
NewsClaims	21463	The ideal treatment for 2019-nCoV may well be a drug like remdesivir plus monoclonal antibodies, Denison says.	1
NewsClaims	21464	"""Mosquitoes do not carry COVID, but because the symptoms are so similar you’ll need to talk with your doctor to see about getting a COVID test,"" Juanette Willis, with the DeKalb County Board of Health, told FOX 5."	1
NewsClaims	21465	For powerful, long-lasting immunity, a so-called live attenuated vaccine is the gold standard.	1
NewsClaims	21466	That's great news for humans, because it's easy to tear open with soap or alcohol-based disinfectants.	1
NewsClaims	21467	Chloroquine phosphate, used for decades to treat malaria, changes the pH level in human cells, making them less acidic—and less hospitable to certain viruses.	1
NewsClaims	21468	A class of drugs called protease inhibitors, long used to treat HIV and hepatitis C, disrupt the viral replication process.	1
NewsClaims	21469	Another class of medications targets an enzyme called polymerase, which strings together copies of the virus's genetic material, RNA, inside the host cell.	1
NewsClaims	21470	Two promising candidates in this category—remdesivir, originally developed to treat Ebola, and favipiravir, first deployed against the flu—impersonate the building blocks of RNA and get incorporated into the chain.	1
NewsClaims	21471	In rare cases, those viruses are also zoonotic, which means they can pass between humans and animals—as was the case with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory system (SARS), two severe coronaviruses in people.	1
NewsClaims	21472	Initially, this novel coronavirus was believed to have started in a large seafood or wet market, suggesting animal-to-person spread, according to the CDC.	1
NewsClaims	21473	But a large number of people diagnosed with the virus reportedly didn't have exposure to the wet markets, and now it's clear that the virus is primarily spreading person-to-person, says the CDC.	1
NewsClaims	21474	"While experts still haven't pinpointed the actual source, new research released online by the CDC on April 21 concludes that SARS-CoV-2 ""is probably a novel recombinant virus""—one that has features closely related to coronaviruses found in bats and pangolins (scaly-skinned mammals)."	1
NewsClaims	21475	However, none of the existing coronaviruses represents its immediate ancestor, notes Susanna K. P. Lau, MBBS, MD, head of microbiology at the University of Hong Kong, and colleagues, who analyzed the genome of the novel coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	21476	"""Although the Wuhan market was initially suspected to be the epicenter of the epidemic, the immediate source remains elusive,"" Dr."	1
NewsClaims	21477	If the Wuhan market were the source, it's possible, they say, that bats carrying the bat coronavirus were mixed in the market, enabling a new combination virus to develop.	1
NewsClaims	21478	"""However, no animal samples from the market were reported to be positive,"" the team points out."	1
NewsClaims	21479	"What's more, neither the first identified case in a human nor other early patients had visited the market, ""suggesting the possibility of an alternative source."""	1
NewsClaims	21480	", also throws cold water on an Internet rumor that the virus may have been created in a lab: ""there is currently no evidence showing that SARS-CoV-2 is an artificial recombinant."""	1
NewsClaims	21481	"""By comparing the available genome sequence data for known coronavirus strains, we can firmly determine that SARS-CoV-2 originated through natural processes,"" Kristian Andersen, PhD, an associate professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research and corresponding author on the paper, said in a statement."	1
NewsClaims	21482	Andersen and colleagues' research implicates bats and possibly pangolins.	1
NewsClaims	21483	", but even if bats are partly to blame, the likelihood that ""bat soup"" played a role is just an extremely misinformed (and potentially xenophobic) rumor."	1
NewsClaims	21484	No, Coronavirus Was Not Caused by 'Bat Soup'–But Here's What Researchers Think May Be to Blame	1
NewsClaims	21485	Since then, more than 9.6 million people worldwide have developed the infection, and at least 490,000 people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University's real-time tracker, which maps confirmed cases of the illness we now know as COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	21486	"helping anyone: Claims that it somehow originated with one woman eating something people are referring to as ""bat soup."""	1
NewsClaims	21487	The clip was reportedly met with outrage from Twitter users, who quickly began calling out Chinese eating habits as the cause of the outbreak.	1
NewsClaims	21488	"No serious sources suggest China ""created"" the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has caused the COVID-19 outbreak."	1
NewsClaims	21489	A recent analysis of the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 virus found no evidence that it was developed artificially in a lab or otherwise engineered.	1
NewsClaims	21490	The virus comes from a family of viruses originating in animals that includes others such as SARS and MERS.	1
NewsClaims	21491	It was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in central China in late 2019 and has been rapidly spreading across the world.	1
NewsClaims	21492	Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, or travel to an area reporting COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	21493	Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	21494	Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?	1
NewsClaims	21495	However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections.	1
NewsClaims	21496	No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.	1
NewsClaims	21497	By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.	1
NewsClaims	21498	To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).	1
NewsClaims	21499	By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.	1
NewsClaims	21500	The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.	1
NewsClaims	21501	The most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water.	1
NewsClaims	21502	However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.	1
NewsClaims	21503	Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health.	1
NewsClaims	21504	There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases.	1
NewsClaims	21505	From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather.	1
NewsClaims	21506	Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body.	1
NewsClaims	21507	Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV.	1
NewsClaims	21508	Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts.	1
NewsClaims	21509	The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands.	1
NewsClaims	21510	Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.	1
NewsClaims	21511	To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.	1
NewsClaims	21512	The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.	1
NewsClaims	21513	However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	21514	The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands.	1
NewsClaims	21515	To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes.	1
NewsClaims	21516	WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene.	1
NewsClaims	21517	‘I see the disinfectant — where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute.	1
NewsClaims	21518	The horrific incident came days after Donald Trump seemingly suggested ingesting disinfectants and ultraviolet light as a possible treatment for coronavirus last week.	1
NewsClaims	21519	Man drank pint of disinfectant after Donald Trump suggested it as Covid-19 treatment	1
NewsClaims	21520	‘So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous — whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light — and I think you said that hasn’t been checked but you’re going to test it,’ Trump said during a White House press conference with coronavirus task force coordinator Dr Deborah Birx.	1
NewsClaims	21521	This conspiracy theory should be easy to debunk: it is biologically impossible for viruses to spread using the electromagnetic spectrum.	1
NewsClaims	21522	It’s worth repeating, as the World Health Organization (WHO) points out, that viruses cannot travel on mobile networks, and that COVID-19 is spreading rapidly in many countries that do not have 5G networks.	1
NewsClaims	21523	A recent variant of this conspiracy theory, particularly beloved by anti-vaccination activists, is the idea that COVID is part of a dastardly Gates-led plot to vaccinate the world’s population.	1
NewsClaims	21524	The Epoch Times insists on calling COVID “the CCP virus” in all its coverage.	1
NewsClaims	21525	A spicier variant is that COVID not only escaped from a lab, but it was intentionally created by Chinese scientists as a biowarfare weapon.	1
NewsClaims	21526	This idea was spread initially by Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, who Tweeted “it’s possible that the US military brought the virus to Wuhan.”	1
NewsClaims	21527	These comments, according to Voice of America news, “echoed a rumored conspiracy, widely circulated in China, that US military personnel had brought the virus to China during their participation in the 2019 Military World Games in Wuhan last October.”	1
NewsClaims	21528	In early March, Italian attorney Francesco Billota penned a bizarre article for Il Manifesto, falsely claiming that GM crops cause genetic pollution that allows viruses to proliferate due to the resulting environmental “imbalance.”	1
NewsClaims	21529	Vaccines could be based on either GM attenuated viruses or use antigens produced in GM insect cell lines or plants.	1
NewsClaims	21530	Alex Jones, between rants about hoaxes and the New World Order, urges viewers to buy expensive miracle pills that he claims can cure all known diseases.	1
NewsClaims	21531	Dr. Mercola, a quack anti-vax and anti-GMO medic who has been banned from Google due to peddling misinformation, claims that vitamins (and numerous other products he sells) can cure or prevent COVID.	1
NewsClaims	21532	Despite evidence to the contrary, nearly 3 in 10 Americans believe the coronavirus was created in a lab, according to survey results released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center.	1
NewsClaims	21533	"Approximately 29% of those surveyed said the virus was ""most likely"" made in a lab, with a large share of that group (23%) saying it was done so intentionally."	1
NewsClaims	21534	Only 6% of respondents said the coronavirus was created accidentally, while 43% said it most likely came about naturally.	1
NewsClaims	21535	Younger adults and those with a high school diploma or a lower education level were more likely to believe that the coronavirus was made in a lab.	1
NewsClaims	21536	Republicans were also more likely than Democrats to say the coronavirus was created by scientists.	1
NewsClaims	21537	He suggested that it may be possible that coronavirus is a targeted biological weapon, like he said Ebola and the bird flu were, that infects some people and not others, and he said that the U.S. government may be testing a pathogenic agent it began developing in 1999.	1
NewsClaims	21538	There's no evidence that taking vitamin C regularly can help prevent coronavirus or COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	21539	Myth 1: The novel coronavirus was engineered in a lab in China.	1
NewsClaims	21540	Because the pathogen first emerged and began infecting people in Wuhan, China, President Donald Trump has claimed—without evidence—that it started in a laboratory there.	1
NewsClaims	21541	Some conspiracy theorists have even speculated it was engineered as a bioweapon, although U.S. intelligence agencies have categorically denied this possibility, stating that the intelligence community “concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified.” No credible evidence has emerged to support an accidental lab release either.	1
NewsClaims	21542	As Scientific American reported earlier this year, Chinese virologist Shi Zhengli—who studies bat coronaviruses and whose laboratory Trump and others had suggested was COVID-19’s source—compared the pathogen’s sequence against that of other coronaviruses her team had sampled from bat caves and found that it did not match any of them.	1
NewsClaims	21543	Zhengli also explained in detail why her lab could not have been the source of the virus in a lengthy response in Science.	1
NewsClaims	21544	But the evidence suggests SARS-CoV-2 was not created in a lab.	1
NewsClaims	21545	Myth 2: Wealthy elites intentionally spread the virus to win power and profit.	1
NewsClaims	21546	Myth 5: Hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment.	1
NewsClaims	21547	In a tweet, Trump called the hydroxychloroquine treatment “one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine,” and he has mentioned it repeatedly in his public coronavirus briefings.	1
NewsClaims	21548	Several studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine does not protect against COVID-19 in those who are exposed.	1
NewsClaims	21549	Myth 6: The Black Lives Matter protests led to increased transmission.	1
NewsClaims	21550	A white paper analysis of protests in 315 of the largest U.S. cities by the National Bureau of Economic Research found no evidence that they led to more COVID-19 cases or deaths.	1
NewsClaims	21551	Myth 8: We can achieve herd immunity by letting the virus spread through the population.	1
NewsClaims	21552	Myth 4: You don’t need to wear a mask.	1
NewsClaims	21553	Although early guidance on masks from the CDC and the WHO was confusing and inconsistent, there is now a strong consensus among public health authorities—supported by numerous studies—that wearing a face covering can limit the transmission of the coronavirus through small exhaled droplets.	1
NewsClaims	21554	"According to American media, COVID-19 originated from China and ""was quickly spread around the world by air travelers who ran high fevers."""	1
NewsClaims	21555	"The US One America News Network TV-channel (OANN) cited Greg Rubini, a US intelligence expert, who said that it ""was genetically engineered as a Bio-Weapon at the Univ."	1
NewsClaims	21556	Independent analysts have spoken with numerous biologists who suggest the virus was likely created artificially.	1
NewsClaims	21557	Of course, some American and mainstream media rushed to refute any arguments suggesting the virus was man-made.	1
NewsClaims	21558	But researchers believe that the risk is low because donors have fully recovered from the infection.	1
NewsClaims	21559	Your doctor may consider convalescent plasma therapy if you're in the hospital with COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	21560	The risk of getting COVID-19 from convalescent plasma hasn't been tested yet.	1
NewsClaims	21561	These can be given to people with COVID-19 to boost their ability to fight the virus.	1
NewsClaims	21562	It's not yet known if convalescent plasma therapy will be an effective treatment for COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	21563	However, more research is needed to determine if convalescent plasma therapy will be an effective treatment for COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	21564	Convalescent plasma therapy may help people recover from COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	21565	However, this therapy might help you recover from the disease.	1
NewsClaims	21566	In India, the use of hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure for COVID-19 is being recommended to more people.	1
NewsClaims	21567	As safety concerns prompt several countries to reconsider the controversial use of a malaria drug to treat COVID-19, India’s government is recommending that front-line workers take the medicine to prevent infection.	1
NewsClaims	21568	The task force says its latest decision is based on three new observational studies, conducted by government agencies, that it says show that the anti-malarial drug can prevent infection.	1
NewsClaims	21569	A case-controlled study cannot determine whether the drug actually prevented infection, says Joseph Cheriyan, a clinical pharmacologist at the University of Cambridge, UK.	1
NewsClaims	21570	So far, scientists have proven that the new coronavirus could not have had been created in a lab.	1
NewsClaims	21571	Their analyses clearly show that the SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construction or a deliberately manipulated virus and is of animal origin.	1
NewsClaims	21572	"""Our current data does not specifically pinpoint the geographical area where the virus emerged, so we cannot specifically confirm emergence in Wuhan; however, the number of early case reports and diagnostic testing is highly convincing for emergence in China in late 2019."""	1
NewsClaims	21573	"""This combination of data puts viral emergence in China between October and December of 2019."	1
NewsClaims	21574	Instead, Dr Tom Jefferson suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could have been lying dormant across the world until emerging under favourable environmental conditions.	1
NewsClaims	21575	Earlier this month, an Oxford University professor claimed that the coronavirus may not have originated in China.	1
NewsClaims	21576	Dr Rossman says that currently, the best evidence for the location and date of SARS-CoV-2 emergence into the human population comes from the early detection of positive cases in China and from the determination of cases presumed to be caused by SARS-Cov-2 through the symptoms exhibited (the study of which is called symptomology).	1
NewsClaims	21577	"Dr Rossman adds that ""we know the SARS-CoV-2 virus rapidly degrades in the environment (such as on contaminated surfaces) and so it is very unlikely that the virus would be able to persist in the environment."""	1
NewsClaims	21578	SHANGHAI/GENEVA (Reuters) - Doctors in Shanghai are using infusions of blood plasma from people who have recovered from the coronavirus to treat those still battling the infection, reporting some encouraging preliminary results, a Chinese professor said on Monday.	1
NewsClaims	21579	“We are positive that this method can be very effective in our patients,” he said.	1
NewsClaims	21580	Scientists are testing two antiviral drugs and preliminary results are due in weeks, while the head of a Wuhan hospital had said plasma infusions from recovered patients had shown some encouraging preliminary results.	1
NewsClaims	21581	However, it is possible that the virus originated in bats and adapted to be able to cause human infection through transmission from other animals based on other similar coronaviruses.	1
NewsClaims	21582	COVID-19 is a naturally occurring virus and was not made in a laboratory.	1
NewsClaims	21583	But according to an April report, 13 of the 41 original cases had no link to the market — which suggests the market wasn't the origin site of the pandemic.	1
NewsClaims	21584	Experts from the WHO and China conducted an investigation into the coronavirus' origins in Wuhan.	1
NewsClaims	21585	Further examination of blood samples taken in 2019 could be the best way to find out when this pandemic really began.	1
NewsClaims	21586	A growing body of evidence suggests the coronavirus was spreading globally months before the first cases in a Wuhan market captured global attention last December.	1
NewsClaims	21587	A May investigation also led the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention to rule the market out as the origin place of the outbreak.	1
NewsClaims	21588	The WHO team confirmed the virus didn't make its initial jump from animals to humans at the Huanan market.	1
NewsClaims	21589	The Wuhan market was not the origin of the pandemic	1
NewsClaims	21590	Few people wear masks on a pier in Oceanside, California, June 22, 2020.	1
NewsClaims	21591	Most likely, the market was simply the site of an early superspreader event, with one sick person infecting an atypically large number of others.	1
NewsClaims	21592	"The levels go down, but less so in cases of severe infection,"" Marion Koopmans, a virologist on the WHO team, told the Wall Street Journal."	1
NewsClaims	21593	Although pinpointing the exact date of the virus' first jump from animals to people is impossible without more data, these findings suggest the pandemic's December anniversary is arbitrary.	1
NewsClaims	21594	"The U.S. president has at times referred to the disease as a ""Chinese virus,"" a term he said he embraced after a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman tweeted an unsubstantiated theory about U.S. Army athletes introducing the pathogen to Wuhan."	1
NewsClaims	21595	"""What we know is that the ground zero for this virus was within a few miles of that lab,"" Peter Navarro, a Trump trade adviser, said Sunday on Fox News."	1
NewsClaims	21596	"""If you simply do an Occam’s razor approach that the simplest explanation is probably the most likely, I think it’s incumbent on China to prove that it wasn’t that lab."""	1
NewsClaims	21597	The U.S.-China blame game has helped fuel scrutiny of the Wuhan lab, which was studying bat-borne coronaviruses like the one that causes Covid-19.	1
NewsClaims	21598	The facility has been the center of multiple conspiracy theories, including one that’s circulated on Chinese social media since late January that the new coronavirus escaped from the lab.	1
NewsClaims	21599	Multiple posts have cited previous blunders by Chinese scientists as evidence that similar research projects haven’t been executed properly.	1
NewsClaims	21600	While many Republicans have emphasized the Chinese origins of a virus that has killed more than 40,000 Americans, Cotton has been among the most vocal urging an investigation into the lab’s role.	1
NewsClaims	21601	"On Friday, he told Fox News that ""circumstantial evidence"" was ""stacking up pretty quickly that this virus may have originated in those labs in Wuhan."""	1
NewsClaims	21602	Although the first known cluster centered on a wet market in Wuhan, the ultimate origins of the virus remain a mystery and Chinese officials have raised the possibility that the virus didn’t begin in the country at all.	1
NewsClaims	21603	Meanwhile, General Mark Milley, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, has endorsed studies that have shown the virus evolved naturally, as opposed to being genetically engineered.	1
NewsClaims	21604	"Shi Zhengli -- a researcher at the institute known as ""Bat Woman"" for her expeditions in bat caves -- said in a February social media post that she would ""swear on my life"" that the virus had nothing to do with the lab."	1
NewsClaims	21605	Wuhan Lab Denies Any Link to First Coronavirus Outbreak	1
NewsClaims	21606	A top Wuhan laboratory official has denied any role in spreading the new coronavirus, in the most high profile response from a facility at the center of months of speculation about how the previously unknown animal disease made the leap to humans.	1
NewsClaims	21607	Yuan Zhiming, director of the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory, hit back at those promoting theories that the virus had escaped from the facility and caused the outbreak in the central Chinese city.	1
NewsClaims	21608	"""There is absolutely no way that the virus originated from our institute,"" Yuan said in an interview Saturday with the state-run China Global Television Network."	1
NewsClaims	21609	"The CDC explains this a bit more, saying ""In general, because of poor survivability of [other coronaviruses SARS and MERS] on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures."""	1
NewsClaims	21610	The best way to stop the spread of the virus remains to regularly wash your hands with soap and water for twenty seconds, or if that’s not available, using a hand sanitiser that has at least 60% alcohol.	1
NewsClaims	21611	"And the WHO explains that: ""The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low."""	1
NewsClaims	21612	"The NHS says simply ""There is currently no evidence that you can catch coronavirus from parcels and letters"", and that it’s ""very unlikely it can be spread through things like packages or food."""	1
NewsClaims	21613	The main way the virus spreads is believed to be from person-to-person contact.	1
NewsClaims	21614	"A scientific paper surveying the available evidence on how long coronaviruses can survive on inanimate surfaces, published after the Covid-19 outbreak began, concluded that ""Human coronaviruses can remain infectious on inanimate surfaces for up to 9 days."""	1
NewsClaims	21615	"It’s possible that the suggestion that the novel coronavirus can survive on surfaces for 28 days may stem from an article by AccuWeather, which referenced a 2010 study and said that at ""lower temperatures, the virus could survive on a stainless steel surface from 5 to 28 days""."	1
NewsClaims	21616	The advice from medical bodies including the NHS, the USA’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the World Health Organisation (WHO) all say that the risk of catching the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 from a package is low, or that there’s no evidence this can happen.	1
NewsClaims	21617	FACT: Studies show hydroxychloroquine does not have clinical benefits in treating COVID-19	1
NewsClaims	21618	Current data shows that this drug does not reduce deaths among hospitalised COVID-19 patients, nor help people with moderate disease.	1
NewsClaims	21619	Since the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), there have been widespread claims on social media that certain foods and supplements can prevent or cure COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	21620	Overall, there’s no evidence indicating that foods can even affect the pH levels of blood, cells or tissues – let alone cure viral infections.	1
NewsClaims	21621	However, there’s no scientific evidence that lemon can cure the disease.	1
NewsClaims	21622	Coronavirus: there are no miracle foods or diets that can prevent or cure COVID-19	1
NewsClaims	21623	There is also currently no existing scientific evidence demonstrating that a ketogenic diet can prevent coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	21624	Lemon is a good source of vitamin C, which is important for helping immune cells work properly.	1
NewsClaims	21625	"Some of the ""alkaline foods"" said to ""cure"" coronavirus were lemons, limes, oranges, turmeric tea and avocados."	1
NewsClaims	21626	Though we all want to protect ourselves against COVID-19, there is currently no evidence that eating certain foods or following certain diets will protect you against coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	21627	The ketogenic diet won’t prevent coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	21628	"Fake news spread on social media claims ""super foods"" can cure COVID-19."	1
NewsClaims	21629	Misinformation spread on social media suggests the virus can be cured by eating foods with a pH (level of acidity) that is higher than the virus’s pH.	1
NewsClaims	21630	However, the BDA does advise adults living in the UK to take a daily supplement of 10 micrograms of vitamin D and eat vitamin D rich foods, like oily fish, egg yolks, and fortified breakfast cereals to ensure adequate vitamin D levels.	1
NewsClaims	21631	The ketogenic (keto) diet, which is a high-fat and low-carbohydrate diet, has been said to be protective against COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	21632	The bottom line is that there are no miracle foods or supplements guaranteed to protect people from novel coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	21633	One viral Facebook video claimed that drinking warm water with lemon slices could combat novel coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	21634	Though garlic is considered to be a healthy food, there’s no evidence showing that eating it can prevent or cure COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	21635	Singles out a certain food over others to protect or treat the virus	1
NewsClaims	21636	The British Dietetic Association (BDA) has stated no specific food or supplements can prevent a person from catching COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	21637	The coronavirus is part of the American biological war against Russia and China.	1
NewsClaims	21638	"""We have been informed by Denmark of a number of persons infected with coronavirus from mink, with some genetic changes in the virus,"" WHO said in a statement emailed to Reuters in Geneva."	1
NewsClaims	21639	COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark will cull its mink population of up to 17 million after a mutation of the coronavirus found in the animals spread to humans, the prime minister said on Wednesday.	1
NewsClaims	21640	The head of the WHO’s emergencies programme, Mike Ryan, called on Friday for full-scale scientific investigations of the complex issue of humans - outside China - infecting mink which in turn transmitted the virus back to humans.	1
NewsClaims	21641	Denmark plans to cull its mink population after coronavirus mutation spreads to humans	1
NewsClaims	21642	The radiation warps the structure of their genetic material and prevents the viral particles from making more copies of themselves.	1
NewsClaims	21643	As a result, a concentrated form of UVC is now on the front line in the fight against Covid-19.	1
NewsClaims	21644	I.e if it is the case that the likliness of transmission of Covid-19 on equipment is low whereas the cost of the operation including H is high it may not be worthwhile.	1
NewsClaims	21645	Is using UV light to kill Covid-19 effective?	1
NewsClaims	21646	Banks have even been using the light to disinfect their money.	1
NewsClaims	21647	A survey released by French polling institute IFOP on 6 April revealed that 59% of the French population believes chloroquine is effective against the new coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	21648	"Former conservative industry minister and Nice Mayor Christian Estrosi, a personal friend of Raoult’s, recently appeared on TV after recovering from COVID-19 and told viewers he was ""convinced"" the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin cured him."	1
NewsClaims	21649	Bioweapons, secret labs, and the CIA: pro-Kremlin actors blame the U.S. for coronavirus outbreak	1
NewsClaims	21650	While epidemiologists work to identify the exact source of the outbreak, officially known as 2019-nCov, pro-Kremlin actors are already blaming the United States for supposedly using bioweapons to disseminate the virus.	1
NewsClaims	21651	During the Cold War, a Soviet disinformation campaign blamed the United States for the AIDS virus.	1
NewsClaims	21652	"Known as Operation Infektion, the campaign began in 1983 when a little-known Indian newspaper — later exposed to be financed by the Soviet leadership — published an anonymous letter with the headline, ""AIDS May Invade India: Mystery Disease Caused by U.S."	1
NewsClaims	21653	The column pushed a conspiracy theory that the virus causing AIDS was developed in an underground U.S. biological weapons lab.	1
NewsClaims	21654	Narratives blaming the United States for the coronavirus outbreak first appeared on fringe pro-Kremlin outlets, and are spreading to well-established Kremlin media, Russian politicians, and social media platforms including YouTube and VKontakte (VK).	1
NewsClaims	21655	Fringe pro-Kremlin outlets have accused the United States of using bioweapons against China, claiming the U.S. is using economic and military tools to pressure its competitor China.	1
NewsClaims	21656	An alternate version of the narrative, disseminated by Katushya.org, states that the Chinese military is claiming the virus was artificially produced in U.S. laboratories with the goal of breaking China from within.	1
NewsClaims	21657	Pro-Kremlin outlets claimed the United States was behind the spread of coronavirus in China.	1
NewsClaims	21658	, the lab is one of many U.S. bases around the world for bioweapons manufacturing, implying it could be doing so again in the current outbreak.	1
NewsClaims	21659	In one case he claimed the virus appeared in China because U.S. pharmaceutical companies want to cash in on the vaccine, while in the other he said the U.S. has allegedly used biological weapons against China.	1
NewsClaims	21660	Russian MP Vladimir Zhirinovsky claimed the United States had economic motives for allegedly spreading the coronavirus: mostly, to undermine China’s economy.	1
NewsClaims	21661	In addition to news outlets, small Russian YouTube channels are beginning to share videos which narrators discuss the coronavirus outbreak and link its appearance in China to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency as well as U.S. bioweapons research.	1
NewsClaims	21662	Screenshots of YouTube videos claiming the CIA is behind the coronavirus and that it is a bioweapon of the United States.	1
NewsClaims	21663	The Russian social network VK has is also being employed to spread the same disinformation narratives blaming the United States for the outbreak.	1
NewsClaims	21664	Accounts on the Russian social network VK spread the same narrative of the United States being behind the coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	21665	It is unknown whether these narratives blaming the United States for the coronavirus outbreak will spread alongside the outbreak itself, but it serves as a reminder of Russia’s long history of employing anti-U.S. influence operations during public health crises.	1
NewsClaims	21666	MYTH: Pets will give you coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	21667	We do not yet know if pets can transmit the virus to people.	1
NewsClaims	21668	MYTH: Encouraging your children to practice good hand hygiene won’t make a difference	1
NewsClaims	21669	Good hand hygiene is always beneficial and the most important way to prevent the spread of illness.	1
NewsClaims	21670	In fact, if school-age kids use sanitizer at least four times over the course of the school day, it can reduce illness-related absences by at least 25 percent in the school.	1
NewsClaims	21671	Fact check: An alkaline diet won't kill the coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	21672	Though a healthy diet can help strengthen immune systems, there is not enough of an effect to stop the coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	21673	The idea behind the benefits of an alkaline diet claim is that increasing the body's pH levels will create an environment that's deadly to the virus.	1
NewsClaims	21674	There are no established or approved preventive measures or treatments for COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	21675	"A claim posted on Facebook alleged that the pH of the coronavirus varies from 5.5 to 8.5, and ""all we need to do, to beat coronavirus,"" is eat alkaline foods above the pH levels of the virus."	1
NewsClaims	21676	The idea that alkaline foods will help beat the coronavirus is also false.	1
NewsClaims	21677	The claim: An alkaline diet will help beat the coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	21678	"The time needed to freeze and thaw food and food packaging makes contamination with COVID-19 even less likely."""	1
NewsClaims	21679	"Cornell University’s Institute for Food Safety likewise reports that ""it is extremely unlikely that any food or food packaging would be contaminated with COVID-19."	1
NewsClaims	21680	"""As of now, there is no evidence of transmission from packaging, particularly frozen food packaging, to humans,"" Amira Roess, PhD, MPH, a professor of global health and epidemiology at George Mason University in Virginia, told Healthline."	1
NewsClaims	21681	"""In one report, over 200,000 frozen food samples were tested for COVID-19, and one came back positive."	1
NewsClaims	21682	But that genetic material only means the virus was there, not necessarily that it was still viable and active on the packaging — or in sufficient quantities to cause infection.	1
NewsClaims	21683	And while it’s possible that touching an object, such as food packaging, and then touching your mouth or nose could transmit it, the virus is much more likely to be spread through the air.	1
NewsClaims	21684	"Based on current data, the amount of virus found on packaging is likely not enough to pose a risk for humans,"" she added."	1
NewsClaims	21685	The CDC also notes there’s no evidence of the virus spreading by eating food.	1
NewsClaims	21686	For extra reassurance, Roess said people concerned about transmission via frozen food should wipe the items down as soon as they return from the grocery store, before putting them in the freezer.	1
NewsClaims	21687	Can the New Coronavirus Be Transmitted by Frozen Foods?	1
NewsClaims	21688	"""While it’s impossible to predict ‘zero risk’ for obtaining an infection via active virus on any particular surface, it is very unlikely and very low risk,"" Rohde said."	1
NewsClaims	21689	Those handling the products before shipping or in transit should wear masks and gloves, she added.	1
NewsClaims	21690	The World Health Organization has said the new coronavirus and COVID-19, the respiratory disease it causes, were unknown before the outbreak was reported in Wuhan, central China, late last year.	1
NewsClaims	21691	Italy’s first COVID-19 patient was detected on Feb. 21 in a small town near Milan, in the northern region of Lombardy.	1
NewsClaims	21692	This guidance includes frequently washing your hands and cleaning and disinfecting surfaces that are used often.	1
NewsClaims	21693	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is simply not known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	21694	"""To our knowledge, this is the first free-ranging, native wild animal confirmed with SARS-CoV-2,"" Thomas DeLiberto and Susan Shriner, of the USDA’s Animal and Plant Inspection Service, said."	1
NewsClaims	21695	Three companies are presently working on mink vaccines that may be ready by the spring, Hildebrandt said.	1
NewsClaims	21696	At least 367 people got infected with mink variants, and 12 of those people had Cluster-5.	1
NewsClaims	21697	"Epidemiologists use the term ""One Health"" to describe why investigating zoonotic disease outbreaks is critical to the health of people, livestock, wildlife, and the environment."	1
NewsClaims	21698	European farms are also managed more cooperatively, which may have offered more opportunities for the farm-to-farm spread that was documented there.	1
NewsClaims	21699	Some of these mutations can help the virus spread faster, worsen the severity of disease, make it harder for the body to fight, or make therapeutics or vaccines less effective.	1
NewsClaims	21700	Then, in mid-December, a wild mink trapped near a Utah mink farm was confirmed to have the virus.	1
NewsClaims	21701	Speed is essential for any zoonotic disease response.	1
NewsClaims	21702	To limit risk of the virus spreading further, the bodies must be buried immediately, predators and scavengers kept away, the lined trucks disinfected.	1
NewsClaims	21703	Currently, mink farmers are hanging onto this year’s pelts while scientists work out whether fur can spread the virus and if so how to decontaminate it.	1
NewsClaims	21704	They knew mink might be susceptible, because they share some immune response similarities and a key lung receptor with people.	1
NewsClaims	21705	Researchers found the virus passed from people to mink and back again, mutating as it went.	1
NewsClaims	21706	In Europe, the virus had spread from farm to farm, and also jumped back to humans.	1
NewsClaims	21707	"The mink almost certainly got it from farmworkers, a jump called ""reverse zoonosis."""	1
NewsClaims	21708	Steroid Drugs Are an Effective Treatment for Severe COVID-19: WHO	1
NewsClaims	21709	The RCMP and PHAC have consistently denied any connections between the pandemic and the virus shipments.	1
NewsClaims	21710	All of this has led to conspiracy theories linking the novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, Canada's microbiology lab, and the lab in Wuhan.	1
NewsClaims	21711	MYTH: Coronavirus was formulated in a lab in Wuhan	1
NewsClaims	21712	Local health officials in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China reported several cases of pneumonia among a group of people linked to a wholesale market in Wuhan in December 2019.	1
NewsClaims	21713	MYTH: Recreational drugs cure coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	21714	Facebook posts have claimed that weed is a cure for coronavirus (False: Cannabis “Kills Coronavirus,” 2020).	1
NewsClaims	21715	Rumors have said the same about cocaine.	1
NewsClaims	21716	One medication, an antiviral drug called Remdesivir, has been shown in certain studies to improve symptoms and shorten hospital stays.	1
NewsClaims	21717	There are also two vaccines that have received emergency use authorization from the FDA – one made by Pfizer and one made by Moderna.	1
NewsClaims	21718	MYTH: Spraying chlorine/rubbing alcohol on your body can cure coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	21719	Rubbing or spraying cleaning products—whether that’s chlorine or rubbing alcohol—will not kill viruses already inside your body.	1
NewsClaims	21720	MYTH: Inhaling bleach fumes cures coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	21721	Inhaling bleach fumes is dangerous and will not kill viruses that are already inside you.	1
NewsClaims	21722	MYTH: Ultraviolet light can kill coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	21723	MYTH: Air dryers can kill coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	21724	MYTH: Antibiotics are effective at treating coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	21725	“Antibiotics do not treat viruses of any kind, including coronaviruses,” Dr. Kenney states unequivocally.	1
NewsClaims	21726	MYTH: Sesame oil and garlic can prevent transmission of coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	21727	While garlic has been shown to have some antimicrobial properties, neither garlic nor sesame oil will prevent the transmission of this virus.	1
NewsClaims	21728	MYTH: Regularly rinsing your nose with saline can prevent coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	21729	There is no evidence that rinsing your nose with saline can prevent coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	21730	But you can help reduce your risk of catching coronavirus by following proper hand hygiene before touching your mouth, nose, or eyes, all of which have mucosal linings where the virus may enter.	1
NewsClaims	21731	MYTH: Drinking liquids will wash the virus into your stomach where it will die	1
NewsClaims	21732	While it is always a good idea to stay hydrated, it is definitely still possible to become infected even if you are drinking fluids.	1
NewsClaims	21733	MYTH: It’s not safe to receive a package from China	1
NewsClaims	21734	It is, in fact, safe to accept packages that have been shipped from China.	1
NewsClaims	21735	The CDC notes that there’s a low risk of infection from products that have been shipped from areas with outbreaks because of the virus’s “low survivability on surfaces” (2019-nCoV Frequently Asked Questions, 2020).	1
NewsClaims	21736	“This EUA opens the way for us to provide emergency use of remdesivir to more patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19,” said Daniel O’Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Gilead Sciences.	1
NewsClaims	21737	It is not yet known if remdesivir is safe and effective for the treatment of COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	21738	Jeremy Corbyn’s brother Piers has claimed that Bill Gates and George Soros are behind the coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	21739	Two Studies Find That Humidity Prevents Coronavirus Spread	1
NewsClaims	21740	Two independent studies have identified a useful tool for stopping the coronavirus: humid air.	1
NewsClaims	21741	According to the research, dry air not only hampers our lungs’ ability to clear out respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2, but also makes it harder for our immune systems to fight it off once we’ve been infected,	1
NewsClaims	21742	And on the contrary, relative humidity between 40 and 60 percent seems to make it much harder for the coronavirus to take hold — an epidemiological clue that we could weaponize against the virus.	1
NewsClaims	21743	Iwasaki collaborated with Swiss physician Walter Hugentobler, who noticed that pilots and flight attendants caught the flu at unusually-high rates, eventually linking the phenomenon to extremely-dry cabin air, according to	1
NewsClaims	21744	More recently, MIT engineer Hazhir Rahmandad found that COVID-19 spread more rapidly in dry regions of Iran than those with greater humidity.	1
NewsClaims	21745	While the news seems to indicate that the pandemic may drop off during the summer, government leaders and the public could take that as a sign to relax protective lockdown measures and return to normal life.	1
NewsClaims	21746	she’s lobbying the World Health Organization to call for greater indoor humidification as a protective measure, especially in places like nursing homes — but the organization has yet to respond.	1
NewsClaims	21747	The discredited and unsubstantiated theory claims that a news programme aired in 2015 about a Chinese lab’s experiments and research on other coronaviruses was proof that the novel virus had originated in that same lab.	1
NewsClaims	21748	"Salvini tweeted, in all caps, ""2015, the Chinese created a supercoronavirus with bats and mice!!!"""	1
NewsClaims	21749	"A director at the Italian National Research Council (CNR) told La Repubblica: ""The current virus does not originate from the first version of Sars, and not least did it come from mice."	1
NewsClaims	21750	The magazine Nature, which published the 2015 study on which the TV programme was based, has also said that the novel coronavirus did not originate in a lab.	1
NewsClaims	21751	Scientists from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute in Queensland have developed two new drugs to both prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, and also treat people who have been exposed to the virus so they do not develop severe disease.	1
NewsClaims	21752	"""Our drugs stop the tag from being removed and also protect the untagged ACE2 receptors from being infected."""	1
NewsClaims	21753	"""Our new peptide-based drugs can keep the padlock closed and prevent infection taking hold,"" Professor Rao said."	1
NewsClaims	21754	Coronaviruses are known to circulate in mammals and birds, and scientists have already suggested that nCoV-2019 originally came from bats.	1
NewsClaims	21755	Now, the South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou says that two of its researchers have identified the pangolin as the potential source of nCoV-2019.	1
NewsClaims	21756	The statement has no supporting evidence and is another example of conspiracy narratives on a plot against China, profitable to the US; on the UK which invented coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	21757	As for the statement that British scientists from Porton Down laboratory put poison on the Skripals' door handle, it is not supported by any evidence.	1
NewsClaims	21758	According to results published Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine, two-thirds of COVID-19 patients improved after taking Gilead Sciences’ remdesivir drug.	1
NewsClaims	21759	"""The idea is, if we give a direct-acting antiviral to the patient and we stop it from replicating, hopefully, if we can catch it early enough in the disease, they don’t go into the inflammatory cascade that leads to lung failure,"" Grimes said."	1
NewsClaims	21760	Remdesivir is administered once daily.	1
NewsClaims	21761	Perez said they hope the drug will help slow the viral replication in patients to prevent them from needing intubation or, at least, to remove them from mechanical ventilation sooner.	1
NewsClaims	21762	No benefit of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 patients, study finds	1
NewsClaims	21763	Convalescent plasma therapy didn't help 52 seriously ill COVID-19 patients recover in the first known randomized study of its kind, although it was stopped early because of low enrollment.	1
NewsClaims	21764	Six (20.7%) of 29 patients with life-threatening disease receiving convalescent plasma recovered, compared with 7 (24.1%) of 29 of the control group (HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.30 to 2.63];	1
NewsClaims	21765	Two patients receiving convalescent plasma group experienced adverse events within hours after transfusion but improved with supportive care.	1
NewsClaims	21766	The authors noted that most previous studies on convalescent plasma lacked standardization and procedure control in donor selection and the type or level of antibodies in the convalescent plasma.	1
NewsClaims	21767	"""This may explain the varied therapeutic effects seen across a variety of diseases or even across patients with the same disease,"" they said, adding that the World Health Organization has issued guidance on clinical trials of convalescent plasma in a pandemic."	1
NewsClaims	21768	"In a commentary in the same journal, Arturo Casadevall, MD, PhD, of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore and colleagues said that while convalescent plasma didn't lead to significant improvements in clinical status or death rate, the study generated ""potentially hopeful signals,"" adding that convalescent plasma may be useful in combination with antiviral drugs."	1
NewsClaims	21769	This is another conspiracy theory about the 2019-nCoV coronavirus, based on recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about biological weapons and the Lugar Lab in Georgia.	1
NewsClaims	21770	"A group of 27 prominent public health scientists, from nine countries, wrote a statement published online by the Lancet, that ""strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin"", and they “overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife,” just like many other viruses that have recently emerged in humans."	1
NewsClaims	21771	However, the solution, when mixed, develops into a dangerous bleach which has caused serious and potentially life-threatening side effects.	1
NewsClaims	21772	“Everyone needs to pay attention to COVID-19 prevention by following well-accepted guidelines related to social distancing, face covering, hand-washing, and self-isolation and testing in the setting of possible COVID-related symptoms.”	1
NewsClaims	21773	Colloidal silver has not been shown effective against new virus from China	1
NewsClaims	21774	CLAIM: Colloidal silver products can help prevent or protect against the new coronavirus from China.	1
NewsClaims	21775	“There are no complementary products, such as colloidal silver or herbal remedies, that have been proven effective in preventing or treating this disease (COVID-19), and colloidal silver can have serious side effects,” Dr. Helene Langevin, National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health director, said in a statement.	1
NewsClaims	21776	MYTH: “The COVID-19 virus was stolen out of a Canadian lab by Chinese spies.”	1
NewsClaims	21777	PolitiFact, FactCheck.org, and the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. all concluded that there is no evidence that the COVID-19 virus was stolen by Chinese spies from a Canadian lab.	1
NewsClaims	21778	MYTH: “The COVID-19 virus contains ‘HIV-like insertions,’ suggesting it was engineered.”	1
NewsClaims	21779	MYTH: “The COVID-19 virus is a manmade bioweapon.”	1
NewsClaims	21780	Scientific evidence points to the virus originating in bats.	1
NewsClaims	21781	A March 2020 study published in the journal Nature Medicine concluded that the virus “is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus.”	1
NewsClaims	21782	MYTH: “The French Pasteur Institute patented the virus”	1
NewsClaims	21783	The Pasteur Institute, a French research foundation, did not invent or patent the COVID-19 virus.	1
NewsClaims	21784	MYTH: “The COVID-19 virus was engineered in a laboratory at the University of North Carolina”	1
NewsClaims	21785	“There is no evidence that this is true; scientists believe that an animal is the most likely source of the coronavirus.”	1
NewsClaims	21786	MYTH: “A group funded by Bill Gates patented the COVID-19 virus.”	1
NewsClaims	21787	While it is true that the U.K.-based Pirbright Institute has accepted funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the patent referenced in these claims covers a separate strain of coronavirus that only affects chickens, not humans.	1
NewsClaims	21788	MYTH: “5G cell phone technology is linked to the coronavirus outbreak.”	1
NewsClaims	21789	There is no evidence that the health effects of the COVID-19 virus are related to 5G, according to articles from Reuters and FullFact.org.	1
NewsClaims	21790	MYTH: “Colloidal silver can cure COVID-19.”	1
NewsClaims	21791	According to the U.S. National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, “scientific evidence doesn’t support the use of colloidal silver dietary supplements for any disease or condition.” Using colloidal silver can cause a condition called argyria, a permanent bluish-gray discoloration of the skins, nails, and gums.	1
NewsClaims	21792	In a February 2020 article by The Associated Press, NCCIH director Helene Langevin said, “There are no complementary products, such as colloidal silver or herbal remedies, that have been proven effective in preventing or treating this disease (COVID-19), and colloidal silver can have serious side effects.”	1
NewsClaims	21793	MYTH: “Miracle Mineral Solution can cure COVID-19.”	1

NewsClaims	21798	MYTH: “Lemon and hot water can cure COVID-19.”	1
NewsClaims	21799	MYTH: “George Soros owns a lab in Wuhan where the coronavirus was created”	1
NewsClaims	21800	However, he does not own the company, and there is no evidence connecting the company – or Soros – to the outbreak.	1

NewsClaims	21810	The analysis of public genome sequence data from SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses found no evidence that the virus was made in a laboratory or otherwise engineered.	1
NewsClaims	21811	"""By comparing the available genome sequence data for known coronavirus strains, we can firmly determine that SARS-CoV-2 originated through natural processes,"" said Kristian Andersen, PhD, an associate professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research and corresponding author on the paper."	1
NewsClaims	21812	The resulting genomic sequence data has shown that Chinese authorities rapidly detected the epidemic and that the number of COVID-19 cases have been increasing because of human to human transmission after a single introduction into the human population.	1
NewsClaims	21813	The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was so effective at binding the human cells, in fact, that the scientists concluded it was the result of natural selection and not the product of genetic engineering.	1
NewsClaims	21814	"""These two features of the virus, the mutations in the RBD portion of the spike protein and its distinct backbone, rules out laboratory manipulation as a potential origin for SARS-CoV-2"" said Andersen."	1
NewsClaims	21815	"""They conclude that the virus is the product of natural evolution,"" Goulding adds, ""ending any speculation about deliberate genetic engineering."""	1
NewsClaims	21816	The researchers proposed bats as the most likely reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 as it is very similar to a bat coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	21817	A coronavirus from a pangolin could possibly have been transmitted to a human, either directly or through an intermediary host such as civets or ferrets.	1
NewsClaims	21818	However, clinical data are still very limited and inconclusive, and the beneficial effects of these medicines in COVID-19 have not been demonstrated.	1
NewsClaims	21819	Taking low-dose aspirin may reduce the risk of severe illness or death from COVID-19, study says	1
NewsClaims	21820	Taking low-dose aspirin may reduce ICU admissions and in-hospital deaths of COVID-19 patients, according to a new study.	1
NewsClaims	21821	While this is reassuring, it’s also important to remind patients that there is NO evidence that elderberry can help treat or prevent COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	21822	Overall, there is no strong evidence that elderberry can cause cytokine storm syndrome, but there’s also no good evidence that it can improve symptoms or prevent COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	21823	CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article claimed a laboratory near Wuhan could be to blame for the outbreak of coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	21824	This has since been disputed, with the source said to be an animal market	1
NewsClaims	21825	China's deadly coronavirus outbreak was linked to a secret lab created to study the world's most dangerous diseases, insiders claimed.	1
NewsClaims	21826	However the sources of the outbreak is said to be at a seafood and animal market in Wuhan - not a lab.	1
NewsClaims	21827	Yesterday, coronavirus was linked to bats after the first cases were traced back to a food market in the city.	1
NewsClaims	21828	Scientists said the flying mammals could host the virus.	1
NewsClaims	21829	The outbreak has also been linked to eating venomous snakes, which were also seen at the food market.	1
NewsClaims	21830	The claim: The coronavirus may have originated in a Chinese laboratory.	1
NewsClaims	21831	One of the most prominent initial reports on the virus is an article published in January 2020 by the right-leaning Washington Times that suggests the coronavirus may have originated in a research laboratory in Wuhan, China.	1
NewsClaims	21832	Related:WHO says coronavirus came from an animal and was not made in a lab	1
NewsClaims	21833	More:Fact check: Coronavirus originated in China, not elsewhere, researchers and studies say	1
NewsClaims	21834	"They concluded it does not show signs of having been manufactured or purposefully manipulated in a lab, though the exact origin remains murky and experts debate whether it may have leaked from a Chinese lab that was studying it."""	1
NewsClaims	21835	Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., has suggested to Congress and Fox News that there may be a connection between the Wuhan lab and the origin of the virus.	1
NewsClaims	21836	What researchers say: COVID-19 likely originated in nature	1
NewsClaims	21837	Medical journals have pointed toward animals in nature as the origin of the virus.	1
NewsClaims	21838	"""It is probable, likely, that the virus is of animal origin,"" WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said."	1
NewsClaims	21839	On April 21, the World Health Organization noted at a briefing that available evidence indicates coronavirus originated in animals in China late last year and was not manipulated or produced in a laboratory as has been alleged.	1
NewsClaims	21840	Richard Ebright, a professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, said earlier this year in an interview with The Washington Post: “Based on the virus genome and properties, there is no indication whatsoever that it was an engineered virus.”	1
NewsClaims	21841	The Scripps Research Institute released a study that rejects the notion that the virus was man-made.	1
NewsClaims	21842	A statement in the Lancet, a medical journal, written by public health officials who have been following the progression of the virus also asserted that animals are the likely source: “Scientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife.”	1
NewsClaims	21843	Another study published in the Lancet found results based on samples collected from nine patients who had contracted the virus corroborated the theory that the virus had come from bats.	1
NewsClaims	21844	Although scientists say they believe bats were likely the original host, it’s also very possible, the study notes, that the virus was transferred from a bat to another animal that may have been at the seafood market in Wuhan.	1
NewsClaims	21845	While experts agree the virus came from nature, its origins beyond that remain unclear.	1
NewsClaims	21846	One scenario has the virus occurring naturally – from a bat, say – but accidentally escaping the research facility because of poor safety protocols.	1
NewsClaims	21847	Anthony Fauci, the U.S.'s top infectious disease expert, was dismissive of the theory of an accidental escape from a Chinese laboratory, USA TODAY reported on April 18.	1
NewsClaims	21848	But two administration officials with knowledge of the investigation, speaking to USA TODAY on condition of anonymity because it is classified and sensitive, said they have always questioned China's account of how the virus originated and have taken seriously suggestions that it may have resulted from a lab accident that the Chinese are covering up.	1
NewsClaims	21849	"But even as of Jan. 15, 2021, its origins are unclear, as described in this State Department statement: ""The U.S. government does not know exactly where, when, or how the COVID-19 virus — known as SARS-CoV-2 — was transmitted initially to humans."	1
NewsClaims	21850	We rate the claim that COVID-19 may have originated in a Chinese lab as PARTLY FALSE.	1
NewsClaims	21851	Suggestions that the novel coronavirus was engineered for use in bioweapons in a high-security biomedical laboratory in Wuhan, China, were debunked, based on scientific research since the virus began its global spread.	1
NewsClaims	21852	Investigations continue into where COVID-19 began, and no conclusions can be drawn, nor has evidence been presented, that definitively explains the pathogen’s origin.	1
NewsClaims	21853	Circumstantial evidence suggests the virus could have escaped from the Wuhan lab due to a lapse in safety measures.	1
NewsClaims	21854	"While the authors of the study have demonstrated that the virus can ""survive the time and temperatures associated with transportation and storage conditions associated with the international food trade,"" the potential for contamination of food with infectious virus may be possible."	1
NewsClaims	21855	It’s a hypothesis that the authors have advanced, without definitive evidence of transmission at this point in time.	1
NewsClaims	21856	Even if you were to consume food containing infectious virus, the acidity of your stomach would likely kill the virus instantly, making it a non-issue in terms of infectious spread within your body.	1
NewsClaims	21857	And rightfully so, since the main mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is droplet-spread, person-to-person, and not by surfaces or even fomites.	1
NewsClaims	21858	"The CDC has stated that ""currently there is no evidence to suggest that handling food or consuming food is associated with Covid-19."""	1
NewsClaims	21859	And, of course this should include meticulous attention to hand hygiene, cleaning of utensils, material and food contact surfaces.	1
NewsClaims	21860	The authors of the new study hypothesize that workers in meat processing plants could potentially be a vector for spread of the virus, following exposure to the infected meat that that was previously frozen in other countries.	1
NewsClaims	21861	iv found that SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for Covid-19, can survive on frozen meat and fish for periods up to 3 weeks, as researchers continue to explore the possibility that contaminated food could be the source of new outbreaks in countries which had previously controlled the virus.	1
NewsClaims	21862	"It does, however, argue that efforts to reduce the risk of Covid-19 outbreaks ""seeded by contaminated food must begin at the source; that is food processing premises,"" as the authors state."	1
NewsClaims	21863	That said, the contribution from poor working conditions (crowding, poor ventilation, lack of PPE, and shouting due to elevated ambient noise levels) along with contact with other infected workers who report to work—may also be responsible for spread of the virus.	1
NewsClaims	21864	Covid-19 Coronavirus Can Survive On Frozen Meat And Fish For Up To 3 Weeks, Study Finds	1
NewsClaims	21865	As a result, the potential for infectivity—possessing a high enough viral load which is then capable of transmission to a person—after eating the particular food is quite remote.	1
NewsClaims	21866	Thus far, there is no need to be overly concerned, as health officials in Shenzen or Yantai have yet to find any credible threat from these food-borne sources.	1
NewsClaims	21867	"Moreover, the WHO has also issued a statement on food safety and handling explaining that ""it is highly unlikely that people can contract Covid-19 from food or food packaging."""	1
NewsClaims	21868	In light of the new information obtained from the study, people should still realize that the risk of catching the virus from exposure to, or eating previously refrigerated or frozen meat and fish is theoretical at best.	1

NewsClaims	21888	It appears that most of the early cases had contact history with the original seafood market; however, the disease has now progressed to be transmitted by human-to-human contact.	1
NewsClaims	21889	It appears that the virus is becoming more transmissible between humans.	1
NewsClaims	21890	Owing to a shortage of specific treatments and considering the relatedness of 2019-nCoV to SARS-CoV, some drugs and pre-clinical vaccines against SARS-CoV could probably be used to treat this virus.	1
NewsClaims	21891	In total, we have collected 39 cases claiming that the US created the coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	21892	While the pro-Kremlin media has been pushing all sorts of different and often contradictory narratives – ranging from bizarre conspiracy theories, to Ukraine responding inadequately to the pandemic, to the West either failing to react or reacting hysterically – the articles that saw the biggest engagement numbers all claimed that the virus was manufactured by the United States.	1
NewsClaims	21893	This was echoed by Oxford’s Gilbert: “People leaving their homes to receive flu shots should take care to protect themselves against exposure to coronavirus by following all the public health guidelines on social distancing, handwashing and wearing face coverings.”	1
NewsClaims	21894	MYTH: “The COVID-19 virus was stolen out of a Canadian lab by Chinese spies.”	1
NewsClaims	21895	PolitiFact, FactCheck.org, and the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. all concluded that there is no evidence that the COVID-19 virus was stolen by Chinese spies from a Canadian lab.	1
NewsClaims	21896	As NewsGuard’s Washington correspondent Gabby Deutch documented in Wired, the earliest example of this claim was a January 26, 2020 article on GreatGameIndia.com titled “Coronavirus Bioweapon–How China Stole Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponized It.” The article was then republished, word-for-word, on Red-rated misinformation site ZeroHedge.com, then one of the top 900 sites in the U.S., whose version was subsequently reposted on RedStateWatcher.com, an anonymously-run conservative site that is among the top 140 U.S. news sites as measured by engagement.	1

NewsClaims	21901	There is no evidence that the health effects of the COVID-19 virus are related to 5G, according to articles from Reuters and FullFact.org.	1
NewsClaims	21902	The earliest mention NewsGuard could find tying 5G to the new coronavirus was a Jan. 20, 2020 article on the Red-rated, anonymously-run French conspiracy theory blog Les Moutons Enragés, according to data First Draft News shared with NewsGuard.	1
NewsClaims	21903	MYTH: “Colloidal silver can cure COVID-19.”	1

NewsClaims	21905	Existing sellers of colloidal silver began promoting it as a treatment for COVID-19, most prominently on a Feb. 12, 2020 broadcast of televangelist Jim Bakker’s TV show.	1
NewsClaims	21906	On March 6, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Federal Trade Commission warned Bakker to stop representing his silver products as a treatment for COVID-19 on his show and website.	1

NewsClaims	21924	The outbreak that has now swept the world instead began with a simpler story, albeit one with tragic consequences: The prime suspect is “natural” transmission from bats to humans, perhaps through unsanitary markets.	1
NewsClaims	21925	U.S. intelligence officials don’t think the pandemic was caused by deliberate wrongdoing.	1
NewsClaims	21926	But scientists don’t rule out that an accident at a research laboratory in Wuhan might have spread a deadly bat virus that had been collected for scientific study.	1
NewsClaims	21927	On March 12, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lijian Zhao charged in a tweet: “It might be [the] US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan.” He retweeted an article that claimed, without evidence, that U.S. troops might have spread the virus when they attended the World Military Games in Wuhan in October 2019.	1

NewsClaims	21930	So if what Montagnier said is true, the whole family of coronaviruses – which originated over 10,000 years ago – would have to be lab-made, and this is obviously nonsensical.	1
NewsClaims	21931	The 2008 Nobel Laureate for physiology or medicine from France, Luc Antoine Montagnier, caught the media’s attention when he recently endorsed a COVID-19 conspiracy theory – that the virus is human-made.	1

NewsClaims	21945	Throughout the summer, conspiratorial narratives such as the virus being a laboratory creation or a tool of globalist elites for wrecking economic havoc continued to fade[3].	1
NewsClaims	21946	Pro-Kremlin media hail the Sputnik V vaccine across the different language audiences, at times falsely alleging strong international support[5], and accusing the West of attempts to sabotage the Sputnik V vaccine for political and economic reasons[6].	1
NewsClaims	21947	To reach domestic audiences, Russian state-controlled media employ similar narratives as for audiences abroad: according to these, China [9] and Russia are handling the pandemic situation better than EU member states [10] or Ukraine, with safe and effective vaccines [11] at an advanced stage of development, which are sought after by other countries [12] .	1

NewsClaims	21953	The CDC said this strain of deadly virus “breeds rapidly in tissue fibers.” The CDC is urging people to using a wet washcloth when cleaning themselves after using the bathroom instead of toilet paper.	1

NewsClaims	22063	Scientific collaboration with China, on the most dangerous pathogens (referred to as “class 4,” denoting pathogens that can only be the object of research in extremely secure laboratories, designated as “P4”), and on emerging viruses, fits into the context of a French-Chinese agreement for preventing and combatting emerging infectious viruses, signed in Peking on October 9, 2004.	0
NewsClaims	22064	It also fits into the context of the International Health Regulations of 2005, which entered into affect after the agreement, that uphold the principle of containment at source in the battle against infectious diseases.	0
NewsClaims	22065	This intergovernmental collaboration directed:	0

NewsClaims	22072	However, the Institut Pasteur of Shanghai (IPS) is absolutely an independent and distinct Franco-Chinese institut​	0
NewsClaims	22073	Regarding the alleged work of the Shanghai Pasteur Institute (IPS) on the coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	22074	Since the emergence of the nouvel coronavirus in Wuhan, the Institut Pasteur of Shanghai (IPS), in line with its mandate, fulfilled its role as a cooperative Franco-Chinese platform, facilitating a better understanding of the evolution of the new virus.	0
NewsClaims	22075	It published, as early as the first weeks, an article about the three-dimensional structure of the virus.	0
NewsClaims	22076	Its scientific experts furthermore proposed their services to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as the Virology Institut of Wuhan, to help the on-site staff, but they were not contacted.​	0
NewsClaims	22077	The IPS has neither active projects inside the P4 laboratory in Wuhan, nor active projets in any of the P3 laboratories in Wuhan.	0
NewsClaims	22078	The IPS thus brought its active support to other institutes in the Asia region (Hong Kong, Laos, and Cambodia, primarily) and mobilized itself to help preparations in the most vulnerable countries (including African institutes.)	0

NewsClaims	22081	Furthermore, in 2004 the Institut created a vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-1.	0
NewsClaims	22082	The construction of the P4 laboratory of Wuhan began in 2011 and was inaugurated in 2017, which is to say, a dozen years after the invention disclosure that was touted as evidence in the conspiracy theory video.	0

NewsClaims	22112	The lack of effective antiviral drugs against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a glaring issue since the beginning of the pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	22113	Investigators and physicians alike have been searching for a potential therapy that can fill this much needed role.	0
NewsClaims	22114	Early on, there were hopes that remdesivir, which was originally developed to treat hepatitis C and later found effective against Ebola, could be used as an antiviral against COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	22115	However, a large clinical trial showed results which were inconclusive, and the World Health Organization subsequently announced that remdesivir did not significantly reduce mortality rates.	0

NewsClaims	22122	After 30 days of persistent symptoms, he was admitted to a hospital and given supplemental oxygen.	0
NewsClaims	22123	The investigators implemented a 10-day course of remdesivir and within 36 hours, they observed a dramatic improvement in his symptoms.	0
NewsClaims	22124	The clinical response to remdesivir was accompanied by a progressive decrease in levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), which is produced by the liver in response to inflammation.	0
NewsClaims	22125	Doctors also observed an increase in the number of lymphocytes, and performed chest scans that showed clearing of lung inflammation.	0
NewsClaims	22126	The patient was discharged from the hospital on day 43 but was readmitted and again tested positive for COVID-19 on day 54.	0
NewsClaims	22127	Another course of remdesivir was administered, followed by convalescent plasma therapy on day 69 and 70.	0

NewsClaims	22150	Solving this medical mystery is important to prevent future pandemics.	0
NewsClaims	22151	What’s increasingly clear is that the initial “origin story” — that the virus was spread by people who ate contaminated animals at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan — is shaky.	0
NewsClaims	22152	Scientists have identified the culprit as a bat coronavirus, through genetic sequencing; bats weren’t sold at the seafood market, although that market or others could have sold animals that had contact with bats.	0
NewsClaims	22153	The Lancet noted in a January study that the first covid-19 case in Wuhan had no connection to the seafood market.	0
NewsClaims	22154	There’s a competing theory — of an accidental lab release of bat coronavirus — that scientists have been puzzling about for weeks.	0
NewsClaims	22155	Less than 300 yards from the seafood market is the Wuhan branch of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.	0
NewsClaims	22156	Researchers from that facility and the nearby Wuhan Institute of Virology have posted articles about collecting bat coronaviruses from around China, for study to prevent future illness.	0

NewsClaims	22160	Richard Ebright, a Rutgers microbiologist and biosafety expert, told me in an email that “the first human infection could have occurred as a natural accident,” with the virus passing from bat to human, possibly through another animal.	0
NewsClaims	22161	But Ebright cautioned that it “also could have occurred as a laboratory accident, with, for example, an accidental infection of a laboratory worker.” He noted that bat coronaviruses were studied in Wuhan at Biosafety Level 2, “which provides only minimal protection,” compared with the top BSL-4.	0
NewsClaims	22162	Ebright described a December video from the Wuhan CDC that shows staffers “collecting bat coronaviruses with inadequate [personal protective equipment] and unsafe operational practices.” Separately, I reviewed two Chinese articles, from 2017 and 2019, describing the heroics of Wuhan CDC researcher Tian Junhua, who while capturing bats in a cave “forgot to take protective measures” so that “bat urine dripped from the top of his head like raindrops.”	0

NewsClaims	22173	Several online stories inaccurately claim that the new coronavirus contains HIV “insertions” and shows signs of being created in a lab.	0
NewsClaims	22174	But there is no evidence that the new virus was bioengineered, and every indication it came from an animal.	0
NewsClaims	22175	Full Story	0
NewsClaims	22176	We’ve seen similar claims before, but this time many claims are being fueled by an unpublished — and highly dubious — scientific paper.	0
NewsClaims	22177	By delving into the genetic or protein sequences of the virus, many of these stories have an aura of scientific credibility.	0
NewsClaims	22178	But scientists who study viruses say they are incorrect.	0
NewsClaims	22179	One set of stories, subsequently shared on Facebook, inaccurately asserts a link between the new coronavirus, also known as 2019 novel coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV, and HIV, largely based on an unpublished manuscript by scientists in India.	0
NewsClaims	22180	The paper, which was posted on the preprint website bioRxiv (pronounced “bio-archive”) on Jan. 31, claimed to have identified very short “insertions” in the virus’ protein sequence that had an “uncanny similarity” to HIV.	0
NewsClaims	22181	Numerous scientists, however, almost immediately pointed out flaws in the analysis, noting that the sequences are so short, they match a bevy of other organisms — and there’s no reason to conclude they derive from HIV.	0
NewsClaims	22182	The paper was voluntarily withdrawn by its authors just two days later, with one saying, “It was not our intention to feed into the conspiracy theories and no such claims are made here.”	0
NewsClaims	22183	But the speedy withdrawal wasn’t fast enough to prevent some websites from picking up the story and concluding that the new coronavirus had been crafted in a laboratory.	0
NewsClaims	22184	A ZeroHedge article with the headline, “Coronavirus Contains ‘HIV Insertions,’ Stoking Fears Over Artificially Created Bioweapon,” pounced on some of the language in the preprint to argue that the scientists were saying the virus might be “man-made.” The story also cited tweets from a visiting scientist at Harvard who had commented on the preprint and stated that the scientist’s tweets suggested that the virus “might have been genetically engineered for the purposes of a weapon.”	0
NewsClaims	22185	ZeroHedge is a website that we’ve written about before, including for spreading the false idea that the new coronavirus was stolen from a lab in Canada and then weaponized by the Chinese government.	0
NewsClaims	22186	Originally published the same day of the preprint, the ZeroHedge article was updated the following day to include tweets from the Harvard visiting scientist, who by then had seen some of the criticisms of the preprint and was now advocating for additional studies to be done before jumping to any conclusions.	0
NewsClaims	22187	The Harvard scientist, it should be said, is an epidemiologist, health economist and nutritionist, and does not have expertise in virology or bioinformatics.	0
NewsClaims	22188	The bulk of the article, however, remains unchanged.	0
NewsClaims	22189	Well after the preprint was withdrawn, a website that traffics in vaccine misinformation, Health Impact News, also highlighted the invalid HIV connection.	0
NewsClaims	22190	Separately, a blogger posted a different bogus analysis — also making the rounds on Facebook — that posits a portion of the new coronavirus genome is similar to part of a viral vector that was used in previous research on the severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, virus.	0
NewsClaims	22191	Based on this, the author argues that the new virus could have leaked from a Chinese lab working on a vaccine.	0
NewsClaims	22192	The SARS virus caused a global outbreak in 2003 and is similar but distinct from 2019-nCoV.	0
NewsClaims	22193	Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist behind InfoWars and the false idea that the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012 was a hoax, also waded into the coronavirus misinformation pool.	0
NewsClaims	22194	Scientists with expertise in viral genomics, however, say that no such evidence exists.	0
NewsClaims	22195	Kristian Andersen, the director of infectious disease genomics at the Scripps Research Translational Institute, told us in an email that in both cases, the analyses are “completely wrong.”	0
NewsClaims	22196	The HIV study, he said, was a “misunderstanding of how to perform these types of analyses” that also cherry-picked its findings.	0
NewsClaims	22197	The short proteins the Indian scientists found to be similar to HIV are not from HIV at all, Andersen said, but are the result of the natural evolution of coronaviruses.	0
NewsClaims	22198	“Had the authors compared nCoV to related bat viruses (and not just SARS as they did),” he wrote, “they would have realized that the peptides are also present in the bat viruses — and most certainly don’t come from HIV.”	0
NewsClaims	22199	Indeed, other experts have noted the same shortcomings, including Trevor Bedford, a computational biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, who performed the proper sequence alignments and shared the results in a Twitter thread.	0
NewsClaims	22200	He found that all of the so-called “insertions” appear in a bat virus identified from a cave in Yunnan, China — or were artifacts of improper alignment.	0
NewsClaims	22201	Only one “insertion” is not fully shared with the bat virus, Bedford explained, and “in no way suggests engineering” since it is consistent with the types of insertions and deletions that happen in coronaviruses.	0
NewsClaims	22202	“There is absolutely no evidence for either (1) sequence insertions or (2) their relationship to HIV,” he concluded.	0
NewsClaims	22203	The vector, he said, was used to understand coronaviruses and develop vaccines — but is different from 2019nCoV.	0
NewsClaims	22204	“While they’re similar (like worms and people are similar) there is absolutely no way that nCoV is in any way related,” he said.	0
NewsClaims	22205	“If one were to look at the two genomes side by side, it’s very easy to show that they’re obviously not the same — or that one somehow led to the other.”	0
NewsClaims	22206	HIV Drugs	0
NewsClaims	22207	As we’ve just established, there’s no connection between HIV and the new coronavirus, but the fact that some countries are using HIV drugs to treat the new coronavirus is included in many of the social media posts to lend credence to the bogus theory.	0
NewsClaims	22208	One Facebook post says, “Ask yourself why they have been treating with HIV drugs from the start,” and the ZeroHedge story proclaims, “The virus even responds to treatment by HIV medications.”	0
NewsClaims	22209	In fact, it’s not yet clear if the virus does respond to HIV drugs — but the rationale to try it is pretty simple.	0
NewsClaims	22210	Timothy Sheahan, a virologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told us in a phone interview that there aren’t that many FDA-approved antiviral drugs, so when a new virus emerges, doctors just give patients “whatever they think might help.”	0
NewsClaims	22211	Many existing antivirals, he said, are HIV medications, so it’s natural to turn to those.	0
NewsClaims	22212	And there is some precedent for HIV drugs possibly working against coronaviruses.	0
NewsClaims	22213	During the SARS outbreak, for example, scientists performed a drug screen and identified the HIV drug cocktail of lopinavir and ritonavir as having potential antiviral activity against SARS.	0
NewsClaims	22214	That drug combo was also associated with better outcomes among a small group of SARS patients, although it was never tested in a clinical trial, so it’s hard to say if it was truly effective.	0
NewsClaims	22215	It is also currently being tested in a clinical trial in Saudi Arabia against another disease caused by a coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS.	0
NewsClaims	22216	Sheahan, however, is skeptical that HIV drugs will be very effective against the new virus.	0
NewsClaims	22217	The levels of the drug that are likely required to diminish viral replication, he said, “are not achievable” in people.	0
NewsClaims	22218	And in his experiments against the MERS virus in cell culture and in mice, he found lopinavir and ritonavir offered little improvement in severe lung disease or viral replication.	0
NewsClaims	22219	No Signs of Bioengineering	0
NewsClaims	22220	As for the general notion that the virus has been bioengineered, there’s no evidence that’s true.	0
NewsClaims	22221	On the contrary, as we’ve explained before, all lines of evidence point to the virus coming from an animal.	0
NewsClaims	22222	That’s consistent with what scientists have learned about the ecology of coronaviruses in the last 20 years, Sheahan said, including SARS and MERS — and it fits with the fact that the virus shares 96% of its genome with a bat virus.	0
NewsClaims	22223	And not only are there no HIV “insertions” in the virus, but by looking at the virus’ genome, scientists also see zero signs of human tampering.	0
NewsClaims	22224	Bedford, the Fred Hutchinson computational biologist, pointed out on Twitter that the virus’ genetic differences to its most recent common ancestor are “consistent with differences expected to arise during natural evolution.”	0
NewsClaims	22225	An engineered virus, he explained, would likely have a “distorted” amino acid to nucleotide ratio, and also have changes focused in on a “subset of genes.” In other words, when engineering occurs, it’s usually to bring about a meaningful change to the virus — but there’s no evidence of that in the 2019-nCoV genome.	0
NewsClaims	22226	Typically, scientists change nucleotides in a targeted way to create changes in the amino acids they code for.	0
NewsClaims	22227	Since amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, that’s the way to change the proteins the virus produces.	0
NewsClaims	22228	But as Bedford said, out of all the nucleotide changes, relatively few — around 14% — alter the corresponding amino acid, or about what you would expect in a naturally evolving virus.	0
NewsClaims	22229	This ratio also matches that of the bat virus that’s found to be the most similar to 2019-nCoV.	0
NewsClaims	22230	Further, when comparing the amino acid changes that do exist, the number of changes in the respective genes in both 2019-nCoV and the bat virus are highly similar.	0
NewsClaims	22231	Again, if the virus had been engineered, one might expect many of the changes to cluster in one or two genes, but that’s not the case here.	0
NewsClaims	22232	All of this argues against the idea of the new virus having come out of a lab.	0

NewsClaims	22334	The discovery of the peptide-based drugs was made possible after the researchers uncovered a previously unknown mode of entry that SARS-CoV-2 exploits to invade cells and cause COVID-19 disease.	0
NewsClaims	22335	Laboratory tests show the first peptide-based drug reduces infection by cloaking the ACE2 receptor protein on human cells.	0

NewsClaims	22339	It also boosts the immune system's ability to recognise the virus.	0
NewsClaims	22340	Senior researcher and head of QIMR Berghofer's Gene Regulation and Translational Medicine Group, Professor Sudha Rao, said they were able to develop the drugs after discovering that some people have a chemical tag which acts like a padlock on the ACE2 receptor.	0
NewsClaims	22341	"""The tag can either keep the receptor locked or open—controlling infection."	0
NewsClaims	22342	"This means people who have the 'padlock-like' tag on their ACE2 receptors will be less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and those without the tag are more vulnerable to infection,"" Professor Rao said."	0
NewsClaims	22343	The researchers also discovered that if the virus invaded the cells it would unlock the tag from the inside—allowing more efficient virus replication.	0
NewsClaims	22344	"""These are the first drugs we are aware of that can operate on dual fronts."	0
NewsClaims	22345	"We hope, if the clinical trials are successful, that the first drug could be given as a therapy alongside vaccination to prevent the virus binding to cells and taking hold, while the second peptide could be used to stop the virus replicating in already-infected patients."""	0

NewsClaims	22565	As the new coronavirus spreads, theories about its origins have circulated.	0
NewsClaims	22566	And as scientists have studied the virus, some theories have been debunked as false.	0
NewsClaims	22567	The article quoted a former military intelligence officer who claimed the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a maximum-security Chinese laboratory granted authority to research dangerous pathogens, “is linked to Beijing’s covert bio-weapons program.”	0

NewsClaims	22573	And opinion columnist Steven Mosher touted the idea in the New York Post in February.	0
NewsClaims	22574	Vox reported the claim also has been shared widely via message boards in China, prompting Chinese officials to release a statement denouncing the information.	0
NewsClaims	22575	Researchers have been racing to learn about the virus since it was recognized in December 2019 as a new strain.	0
NewsClaims	22576	The Washington Post reported most countries have abandoned their bioweapons programs after years of work did not yield satisfactory results.	0
NewsClaims	22577	Researchers concluded that if the virus were engineered, its genome sequence would more closely resemble earlier and more serious versions of the coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	22578	“If someone were seeking to engineer a new coronavirus as a pathogen, they would have constructed it from the backbone of a virus known to cause illness,” the report said.	0
NewsClaims	22579	“But the scientists found that the SARS-CoV-2 backbone differed substantially from those of already known coronaviruses and mostly resembled related viruses found in bats and pangolins.”	0
NewsClaims	22580	The statement referenced multiple academic and government sources that supported the Lancet article’s conclusion.	0
NewsClaims	22581	These sources include the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; Nature; U.S. National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine; the New England Journal of Medicine; the Chinese Medical Journal; and the medical journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution.	0
NewsClaims	22582	Researchers who analyzed the genome of the coronavirus found its sequence shared a very high resemblance to a coronavirus in bats, but it's possible other animals may have been involved in the transmission process.	0
NewsClaims	22583	“2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus,” a study published in the science journal Nature said.	0
NewsClaims	22584	Researchers concluded the genome sequences of the coronavirus “was closely related … to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses.”	0
NewsClaims	22585	This is based on circumstantial evidence such as the Wuhan Institute of Virology's history of studying coronaviruses in bats, the lab's proximity to where some of the infections were first diagnosed and China's lax safety record in its labs.	0

NewsClaims	22603	In the worst cases, it can cause respiratory failure.	0
NewsClaims	22604	Covid-19 has killed more than 2,340 people, mostly in China, and infected more than 76,000.	0
NewsClaims	22605	The US has tested more than 400 people and found 14 confirmed cases, mostly linked to travelers.	0
NewsClaims	22606	A similar outbreak in 2003 involved the Sars virus, which was thought to have come from bats.	0
NewsClaims	22607	Experts said the coronavirus disinformation campaign has parallels with previous conspiracy theories traced to Moscow, including a KGB disinformation campaign in the 1980s that convinced many around the world that US scientists created the HIV virus that causes Aids.	0
NewsClaims	22608	Several thousand online accounts – previously identified for airing Russian-backed messages on major events such as the war in Syria, the Yellow Vest protests in France and Chile’s mass demonstrations – are posting “near identical” messages about the coronavirus, according to a report prepared for the state department’s Global Engagement Center and seen by AFP.	0
NewsClaims	22609	The accounts are run by humans, not bots, and post at similar times in English, Spanish, Italian, German and French.	0
NewsClaims	22610	They can be linked back to Russian proxies, or carry messages similar to Russian-backed outlets such as RT and Sputnik, the report said.	0
NewsClaims	22611	“In this case, we were able to see their full disinformation ecosystem in effect, including state TV, proxy websites and thousands of false social media personas all pushing the same themes,” said Lea Gabrielle, the head of the Global Engagement Center, which is tasked with tracking and exposing propaganda and disinformation.	0
NewsClaims	22612	The US believes the Russian disinformation campaign is making it harder to respond to the epidemic, particularly in Africa and Asia, as some of the public has become suspicious of the western response.	0
NewsClaims	22613	The WHO warned on Friday that the window to stem the global outbreak was narrowing, voicing alarm at a surge of cases with no clear link to China.	0
NewsClaims	22614	A state official said Russian operatives appeared to have been given “carte blanche” to attack the US.	0

NewsClaims	22623	The blood would be screened to check if he or she had other diseases like hepatitis B or C, he added.	0
NewsClaims	22624	There are no fully licensed treatments or vaccines against the new coronavirus, and the process of developing and testing drugs can take many months and even years.	0
NewsClaims	22625	‘VERY IMPORTANT AREA’	0
NewsClaims	22626	Convalescent plasma has been proven “effective and life-saving” against other infectious diseases, including rabies and diphtheria, Dr. Mike Ryan, head of WHO’s health emergencies program, told reporters in Geneva.	0
NewsClaims	22627	“It is a very important area to pursue,” Ryan said.	0
NewsClaims	22628	“Because what hyperimmune globulin does is it concentrates the antibodies in a recovered patient.	0
NewsClaims	22629	You are essentially giving the new victim’s immune system a boost of antibodies to hopefully get them through the very difficult phase.	0
NewsClaims	22630	“So it must be given at the right time, because it mops up the virus in the system, and it just gives the new patient’s immune system a vital push at the time it needs it.	0
NewsClaims	22631	But it has to be carefully timed and it’s not always successful.”	0
NewsClaims	22632	Ryan added: “So it is a very important area of discovery, and I believe they are starting trials on that in China.	0
NewsClaims	22633	But it is a very valid way to explore therapeutics, especially when we don’t have vaccines and we don’t have specific antivirals.”	0
NewsClaims	22634	As well as using plasma therapies, the Chinese doctors are also trying antiviral drugs licensed for use against other infections to see if they might help.	0
NewsClaims	22635	ROME (Reuters) - The new coronavirus was circulating in Italy in September 2019, a study by the National Cancer Institute (INT) of the Italian city of Milan shows, signaling that it might have spread beyond China earlier than thought.	0
NewsClaims	22636	But it has said “the possibility that the virus may have silently circulated elsewhere cannot be ruled out.”	0
NewsClaims	22637	The WHO said on Monday it was reviewing the results from Italy and additional information published there at the weekend and was seeking clarification.	0
NewsClaims	22638	The Italian researchers’ findings, published by the INT’s scientific magazine Tumori Journal, show 11.6% of 959 healthy volunteers enrolled in a lung cancer screening trial between September 2019 and March 2020 had developed coronavirus antibodies well before February.	0
NewsClaims	22639	A further SARS-CoV-2 antibodies test was carried out by the University of Siena for the same research titled “Unexpected detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the pre-pandemic period in Italy”.	0
NewsClaims	22640	It showed that four cases dating back to the first week of October were positive for antibodies, meaning they had got infected in September, Giovanni Apolone, a co-author of the study, told Reuters.	0
NewsClaims	22641	“This is the main finding: people with no symptoms not only were positive after the serological tests but also had antibodies able to kill the virus,” Apolone said.	0
NewsClaims	22642	“It means that the new coronavirus can circulate among the population for a long time and with a low rate of lethality, not because it is disappearing, only to surge again,” he said.	0
NewsClaims	22643	The WHO said it would contact the paper’s authors “to discuss and arrange for further analyses of available samples and verification of the neutralization results”.	0
NewsClaims	22644	Italian researchers told Reuters in March that they reported a higher than usual number of cases of severe pneumonia and flu in Lombardy in the last quarter of 2019 in a sign that the new coronavirus might have circulated earlier than thought.	0
NewsClaims	22645	There’s no evidence that the new coronavirus can survive on packages for 28 days	0
NewsClaims	22646	"A number of posts on Facebook, which have been shared thousands of times, have warned that ""if you order anything from CHINA be careful with your packages"" due to the coronavirus outbreak, because ""the virus can live on a surface for up to 28 days""."	0
NewsClaims	22647	This worry is likely overstated.	0
NewsClaims	22648	There is currently no evidence that this virus can survive that long on packages.	0
NewsClaims	22649	What does the medical advice say?	0
NewsClaims	22650	"As Dr Todd Ellerin, an expert in infectious diseases, wrote on the Harvard Medical School blog: ""Remember, this is a respiratory virus similar to the flu."	0
NewsClaims	22651	We don’t stop receiving packages from China during their flu season.	0
NewsClaims	22652	"We should follow that same logic for this novel pathogen."""	0
NewsClaims	22653	What do we know about how long this coronavirus survives on surfaces?	0
NewsClaims	22654	Because the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 (technically known as SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, there is little direct evidence on how it behaves.	0
NewsClaims	22655	However, because coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that have been studied for decades, it’s possible to look at the characteristics of similar viruses as a reasonable guide to this one.	0
NewsClaims	22656	But it’s worth noting that this was a study of	0
NewsClaims	22657	animal	0
NewsClaims	22658	coronaviruses, not human ones, and that the viruses lasted longest in very cold and dry conditions: at 4°C and 20% humidity.	0
NewsClaims	22659	This study was considered in the above paper that concluded human coronaviruses can survive for up to 9 days.	0
NewsClaims	22660	"In practice, as the WHO says, a package that ""has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature"" is unlikely to see the virus last as long."	0
NewsClaims	22661	"And as the CDC puts it, while it may be possible to pick up the virus from contaminated surfaces in general, ""this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads""."	0
NewsClaims	22662	Important Information about the novel coronavirus (the virus that causes COVID-19) is constantly evolving.	0
NewsClaims	22663	We will refresh our novel coronavirus content periodically based on newly published peer-reviewed findings to which we have access.	0
NewsClaims	22664	For the most reliable and up-to-date information, please visit the CDC website or the WHO’s advice for the public.	0
NewsClaims	22665	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by the most recent strain of virus from the coronavirus family to infect humans.	0
NewsClaims	22666	This family of viruses also includes Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).	0
NewsClaims	22667	They are called novel coronaviruses because it’s the first time these specific viruses have jumped from animals to humans.	0
NewsClaims	22668	Coronavirus myths, debunked	0
NewsClaims	22669	Rumors have spread rapidly about many aspects of the virus.	0
NewsClaims	22670	Here’s the truth about these coronavirus myths about where the virus originated, who is at risk, how it’s transmitted, and contamination concerns.	0
NewsClaims	22671	That was the start of COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	22672	MYTH: Coronavirus only affects older people	0
NewsClaims	22673	While older people may be more at risk of infection because their immune systems may not be as strong as those of younger adults, they’re far from the only group of people at risk, explains Dr. Patrick J. Kenney, DO, FACOI, who is double-board certified in Internal Medicine and Infectious Disease.	0
NewsClaims	22674	Several groups of people have an increased risk of infection, including those who are immunosuppressed.	0
NewsClaims	22675	Roll outs have begun nationwide but it may be some time before you can get the vaccine yourself.	0
NewsClaims	22676	Even worse, doing so may be harmful to your health.	0
NewsClaims	22677	Chlorine may be used to clean surfaces in your home but should be kept away from your body (WHO, n.d.).	0
NewsClaims	22678	This is similar to the previous myth.	0
NewsClaims	22679	Bleach may also be used to clean surfaces in your home but should be kept away from the body (WHO, n.d.).	0
NewsClaims	22680	Ingesting or inhaling chemicals can be deadly.	0
NewsClaims	22681	Exposing parts of your body to ultraviolet (UV) light can be dangerous.	0
NewsClaims	22682	The UV radiation may cause skin irritation, so you should not use UV sterilization lamps on your hands or other parts of your skin (WHO, n.d.).	0
NewsClaims	22683	It currently isn’t known exactly how temperature affects the virus.	0
NewsClaims	22684	People have wondered the same thing about warm weather as they have about air dryers.	0
NewsClaims	22685	Although some similar viruses such as the common cold spread easier during colder months, the CDC notes that this doesn’t mean you cannot be infected by them during warmer months (2019-nCoV Frequently Asked Questions and Answers, 2020).	0
NewsClaims	22686	The World Health Organization (WHO) says air dryers are not effective at killing the virus, and they advise that you still wash your hands using proper hand hygiene before drying them with an air dryer or paper towels (WHO, n.d.).	0
NewsClaims	22687	A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be detected in aerosols for up to three hours, on copper for up to four hours, on cardboard for up to 24 hours, and on plastic and stainless steel for up to 72 hours (Doremalen, 2020).	0
NewsClaims	22688	However, we don’t know how a warmer temperature would affect that timeline.	0
NewsClaims	22689	But there are common household cleaners that can inactivate the virus, and washing your hands following proper protocol can decrease your risk of infection.	0
NewsClaims	22690	Antibiotics target bacteria, not viruses.	0
NewsClaims	22691	COVID-19 is caused by a virus.	0
NewsClaims	22692	Surfaces in your home can also be cleaned with 70% ethanol (alcohol) cleanser, which can be purchased commercially, or bleach or sodium hypochlorite solutions, all of which inactivate the virus.	0
NewsClaims	22693	The fluids do not wash all of the virus particles into the stomach.	0
NewsClaims	22694	MYTH: You can diagnose yourself with COVID-19 by holding your breath	0
NewsClaims	22695	There is no evidence to suggest that being able to hold your breath is associated with whether or not you have COVID-19.	0

NewsClaims	22743	According to data by the media-analysis group Zignal Labs, more than 16,000 posts on Facebook related to Gates and coronavirus vaccine misinformation have been liked and commented almost 900,000 times, The New York Times reported in April.	0
NewsClaims	22744	However, Facebook isn't the only platform used to spread these conspiracies.	0
NewsClaims	22745	On YouTube, the 10 most popular videos about Gates' purported microchipping vaccine have received over 5 million views, according to the same New York Times report.	0
NewsClaims	22746	"On Twitter, images and tweets describing Gates as a ""deep state puppet"" who wants a vaccine to control the population are also being posted and circulated."	0
NewsClaims	22747	These social-media platforms have tried to take steps to curtail the anti-vaccination or coronavirus misinformation movement on its website.	0
NewsClaims	22748	"On May 11, Twitter announced that it would start labeling ""misleading"" coronavirus information."	0
NewsClaims	22749	Last year, YouTube announced that it would demonetize videos on its platform that are pushing the anti-vaccine agenda.	0
NewsClaims	22750	"YouTube and Facebook also recently took down the 26-minute ""Plandemic"" movie from its platforms."	0
NewsClaims	22751	The debunked film featured the discredited scientist Judy Mikovits' claims that the US and vaccine companies created the coronavirus pandemic for profit.	0
NewsClaims	22752	However, the Gates conspiracy theorists don't just live online in the form of bots and fringe theorists on social media.	0
NewsClaims	22753	Public figures like Roger Stone and Laura Ingraham have also been pushing this message.	0
NewsClaims	22754	Gates has been a longtime supporter of vaccinations, and, so far, Gates has donated $300 million to coronavirus vaccine efforts, according to Vox.	0
NewsClaims	22755	Factors such as age and underlying health conditions such as diabetes can put you at a higher risk of contracting coronavirus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.	0
NewsClaims	22756	But one more factor that could affect your chances of getting coronavirus is your blood type, at least according to one recent study.	0
NewsClaims	22757	People who have blood Type A were “associated with” a 45% “higher risk of acquiring COVID-19” compared to people with other blood types, according to a study published Wednesday in the peer-reviewed New England Journal of Medicine by a team of European scientists.	0
NewsClaims	22758	Meanwhile, people with blood Type O, the most common blood type, less likely to get coronavirus as people with other blood types.	0
NewsClaims	22759	Don’t miss: Here are 9 hand sanitizers that the FDA warns can be toxic if absorbed by the body	0
NewsClaims	22760	The researchers arrived at this result after performing genetic analysis on more than 1,900 severely ill coronavirus patients in Spain and Italy and comparing them with over 2,000 patients who were not sick.	0
NewsClaims	22761	Also see: Here’s a look at who is most at risk of contracting COVID-19 and how much they earn for taking that risk	0
NewsClaims	22762	A commonality they found was a DNA cluster which determines blood types, among other components within the human body.	0
NewsClaims	22763	This prompted further research into which specific blood types were present in the majority of the severe cases of coronavirus they looked at.	0
NewsClaims	22764	Because the DNA cluster is found in other parts of the body, it may not be the case that blood type can predict one’s risk of contracting coronavirus, said Roy Silverstein, a hematologist who is the chairman of the department of medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin.	0
NewsClaims	22765	“ ‘Those who are not Type A should not interpret this study to mean that they can let their guard down.	0
NewsClaims	22766	Similarly, the data are not yet convincing enough to recommend that those with Type A need to do even more than what is recommended.’ ” — Roy Silverstein, Medical College of Wisconsin	0
NewsClaims	22767	“Those who are not type A should not interpret this study to mean that they can let their guard down,” Silverstein, former president the American Society of Hematology, said.	0
NewsClaims	22768	“Similarly, the data are not yet convincing enough to recommend that those with Type A need to do even more than what is recommended.”	0
NewsClaims	22769	A prior study published by the Southern University of Science and Technology in China, which has not been peer-reviewed, and a study by 23andMe, a privately held genetic-analysis company, pointed to similar results.	0
NewsClaims	22770	But even still, Silverstein urged people to take these findings “with a grain of salt.”	0
NewsClaims	22771	“This study, along with other studies from China and from 23andMe all suggest, but do not prove, a statistical association between non-O blood type with either risk of infection with the COVID-19 virus, or with risk of developing severe disease if infected.”	0
NewsClaims	22772	But the studies, he said, should prompt “more rigorous clinical studies as well as basic science studies to probe the mechanisms by which ABO blood type and or ABO genes might influence coronavirus ability to infect cells or the body’s immune response to the virus.”	0

NewsClaims	22804	Trail of Deceit: The Most Popular COVID-19 Myths and How They Emerged	0
NewsClaims	22805	by John Gregory and Kendrick McDonald	0
NewsClaims	22806	Editor’s Note: This report was updated in June 2020 to add additional COVID-19 myths that have become prominent online.	0
NewsClaims	22807	As COVID-19 has spread across the globe, NewsGuard’s team of journalists has been tracking, rating, and flagging websites spreading information about the disease in the Coronavirus Misinformation Tracking Center.	0
NewsClaims	22808	The tracker lists a growing number of websites that have published false claims about COVID-19, from false cures and phony treatments to conspiracy theories about the disease’s origins.	0
NewsClaims	22809	Many of the sites in the tracking center publish the same hoaxes and myths as misinformation spreads virally from one domain to another and through social media posts that amplify false articles.	0
NewsClaims	22810	Here, we document and debunk the top 10 COVID-19 myths that have spread across these sites—and trace how each myth emerged and began to spread across the internet.	0
NewsClaims	22811	Click each myth below to see its entry.	0
NewsClaims	22812	Or scroll down to browse through the full list.	0
NewsClaims	22813	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	22814	The evidence provided for the claim was that two Chinese scientists were escorted from the lab in July 2019.	0
NewsClaims	22815	The CBC did, in fact, report that two Chinese scientists were escorted from the lab that month.	0
NewsClaims	22816	However, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) told the CBC that they were asked to leave due to an investigation of what it described as a “policy breach” and “administrative matter,” and that the matter was not connected to the COVID-19 virus outbreak.	0
NewsClaims	22817	“This is misinformation and there is no factual basis for claims being made on social media,” PHAC spokesperson Eric Morrissette told the CBC in January 2020.	0
NewsClaims	22818	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	22819	As NewsGuard’s Washington correspondent Gabby Deutch documented in Wired, the earliest example of this claim was a January 26, 2020 article on GreatGameIndia.com titled “Coronavirus Bioweapon–How China Stole Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponized It.” The article was then republished, word-for-word, on Red-rated misinformation site ZeroHedge.com, then one of the top 900 sites in the U.S., whose version was subsequently reposted on RedStateWatcher.com, an anonymously-run conservative site that is among the top 140 U.S. news sites as measured by engagement.	0
NewsClaims	22820	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	22821	This claim was attributed to research posted on the website BioRxiv.org, where users can submit scientific studies before they have been peer-reviewed and published.	0
NewsClaims	22822	According to a February 2020 article on the fact-checking website HealthFeedback.org, the study’s finding that there is a similarity between the new strain of coronavirus and HIV “was detected using extremely short protein sequences, a practice that often gives rise to false positive results,” and the authors failed to note that the same sequences are found in many other organisms.	0
NewsClaims	22823	The authors of the study withdrew it from BioRxiv.org two days after it first appeared on the website.	0
NewsClaims	22824	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	22825	The preprint study on BioRxiv.org was first promoted by Harvard University epidemiologist and health economist Eric Feigl-Ding in a series of tweets on Jan. 31, 2020, though he did note the study had not been peer-reviewed.	0
NewsClaims	22826	Ding’s tweets and the preprint study were then cited in a ZeroHedge.com article posted that same day, which was in turn republished in full on InfoWars.com, a Red-rated far-right website that falsely asserted that the mass shooting Sandy Hook Elementary was a hoax, among other false claims.	0
NewsClaims	22827	MYTH: “The COVID-19 pandemic was predicted in a simulation.”	0
NewsClaims	22828	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	22829	The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and the Gates Foundation did host a pandemic preparedness exercise called Event 201 in October 2019.	0
NewsClaims	22830	However the scenario used in the exercise involved a fictional coronavirus with different characteristics than the COVID-19 virus.	0
NewsClaims	22831	For example, in this simulation, the virus originated on pig farms in Brazil, not in China.	0
NewsClaims	22832	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	22833	This earliest example of this claim was Jan. 22, 2020 post on Reddit’s conspiracy subreddit channel, referencing October 2019 news articles about the simulation along with more recent articles about the outbreak in China.	0
NewsClaims	22834	It was then more widely circulated in a Jan. 23 article from InfoWars.	0
NewsClaims	22835	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	22836	“Pirbright does not currently work with human coronaviruses,” the institute said in a January 2020 post on its website responding to the patent conspiracy theory.	0
NewsClaims	22837	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	22838	Fact-checking websites FactCheck.org and Snopes pointed to a Jan. 21, 2020 tweet from Jordan Sather, a U.S. conspiracy theorist with 140,000 Twitter followers and 218,000 subscribers to his “Destroying the Illusion” YouTube channel, as the earliest example of this claim.	0
NewsClaims	22839	InfoWars then repeated it in the Jan. 23 article about the simulation co-hosted by the Gates Foundation described above.	0
NewsClaims	22840	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	22841	A study published in the journal Nature in February 2020 found the new virus’s genome is “96 percent identical” to a bat coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	22842	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	22843	Similar conspiracy theories have been promoted by misinformation websites during earlier disease outbreaks.	0
NewsClaims	22844	For example, NaturalNews.com, a Red-rated network of site promoting both medical and political conspiracies, previously labeled the Ebola virus as a “bioweapon” during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Africa.	0
NewsClaims	22845	The earliest mention NewsGuard could find of the COVID-19 virus being called a “bioweapon” was a Jan. 23, 2020 video from U.S. conspiracy theorist David Zublick, titled “Breaking: Coronavirus Is Bioweapon For Population Control.” Zublick has 160,000 subscribers on YouTube.	0
NewsClaims	22846	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	22847	In an April 2020 article from the BBC, Dr. Simon Clarke, a microbiology professor at the University of Reading, described claims that 5G either transmits the virus, or suppresses the immune system, thus making people more vulnerable to it, as “complete rubbish.” A March 2020 report from the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection found no evidence that 5G networks posed a risk to human health.	0
NewsClaims	22848	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	22849	The earliest mention NewsGuard could find tying 5G to the new coronavirus was a Jan. 20, 2020 article on the Red-rated, anonymously-run French conspiracy theory blog Les Moutons Enragés, according to data First Draft News shared with NewsGuard.	0
NewsClaims	22850	The claims then spread across Facebook Groups and YouTube channels already steeped in misleading 5G claims (such as asserting that it can cause cancer) with a new angle highlighting the novel coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	22851	They were then amplified on social media by celebrities such as actor Woody Harrelson and boxer Amir Khan.	0
NewsClaims	22852	Some in the U.K. eventually attacked 5G telephone poles, prompting the Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport to call on platforms to take action against the spread of these conspiracies.	0
NewsClaims	22853	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	22854	Colloidal silver is a liquid substance containing silver particles.	0
NewsClaims	22855	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	22856	Despite the lack of evidence supporting its use, colloidal silver has been promoted as a cure for all kinds of ailments, from bacterial and viral infections to cancer, since the late 19th century.	0
NewsClaims	22857	Existing sellers of colloidal silver began promoting it as a treatment for COVID-19, most prominently on a Feb. 12, 2020 broadcast of televangelist Jim Bakker’s TV show.	0
NewsClaims	22858	On March 6, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Federal Trade Commission warned Bakker to stop representing his silver products as a treatment for COVID-19 on his show and website.	0
NewsClaims	22859	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	22860	Miracle Mineral Solution, or MMS, is chlorine dioxide, a powerful bleaching agent that has been promoted as a cure-all for everything from cancer to autism.	0
NewsClaims	22861	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	22862	The earliest mention of the theory that MMS could treat the new coronavirus strain was a January 25, 2020 tweet from Jordan Sather, the U.S. conspiracy theorist described above as originating the Bill Gates patent conspiracy.	0
NewsClaims	22863	It was later promoted in a January 27, 2020 article posted on the website of Jim Humble, a former Scientologist and gold prospector who claimed to have discovered MMS in 1996.	0
NewsClaims	22864	THE TRUTH:	0

NewsClaims	22867	The earliest example of this claim was a Jan. 31, 2020 post from an anonymous Twitter account based in the Philippines, sharing a recipe claiming the virus “can be cured by one bowl of freshly boiled garlic water,” according to a February 2020 article from FactCheck.org.	0
NewsClaims	22868	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	22869	While a clinical trial is underway in China to test whether a high-dose vitamin C regimen is effective against the new strain of coronavirus, the claim that it is a proven treatment for COVID-19 is not supported by scientific evidence.	0
NewsClaims	22870	Vitamin C has some marginal benefits for the common cold, such as reducing the duration of symptoms if it is taken before catching the cold, but those benefits can be achieved with a diet that includes 200 milligrams of vitamin C, according to Harvard Health Publishing.	0
NewsClaims	22871	The daily dosage being tested in the Chinese trial is 60 times higher.	0
NewsClaims	22872	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	22873	The claim originated in a Jan. 26, 2020 press release titled “Vitamin C Protects Against Coronavirus,” from the International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine, which promotes large doses of nutritional supplements.	0
NewsClaims	22874	The article was then republished in full the next day on HealthImpactNews.com, a Red-rated network of health sites with 450,000 Facebook followers that has promoted false health claims such as the debunked link between vaccines and autism.	0
NewsClaims	22875	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	22876	This myth relies on the false claim that what you eat or drink creates an alkaline environment in your body, making it less acidic by raising its pH level.	0
NewsClaims	22877	In reality, drinking lemon juice (or anything else) cannot change your body’s pH level.	0
NewsClaims	22878	Similar alkaline diet remedies have been falsely promoted as cancer cures, prompting Cancer Research UK to call them “biological nonsense” in a March 2014 article.	0

NewsClaims	22884	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	22885	The Italian Government has never forbidden the testing of migrants for the COVID-19 virus.	0
NewsClaims	22886	As stated by the director of the provincial health authority of Ragusa Angelo Aliquò in February 2020, “Ministerial guidelines say that only those who come from areas at risk and have symptoms need to be tested.” According to NewSicilia.it, three migrants with symptoms who arrived in Italy on the Ocean Viking ship were tested for COVID-19 in February 2020, and the tests came back negative.	0
NewsClaims	22887	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	22888	This claim appears to have first been published by the Red-rated Italian website VoxNews.info on Feb. 27, 2020, misquoting an interview of Aliquò by Il Primato Nazionale, a site connected to the neo-fascist movement CasaPound.	0
NewsClaims	22889	The next day, the Red-rated ViralMagazine.it published an almost identical article — adding more fabricated quotes attributed to Aliquò — which received more than 80,000 Facebook interactions, more than a third of which were shares, according to CrowdTangle data.	0
NewsClaims	22890	MYTH: “Bill Gates plans to use COVID-19 to implement a mandatory vaccine program with microchips to surveil people.”	0
NewsClaims	22891	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	22892	Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and his charitable foundation have long supported vaccine initiatives.	0
NewsClaims	22893	However, there is no vaccine — for COVID-19 or otherwise — with a microchip or other surveillance feature.	0
NewsClaims	22894	In December 2019, researchers at MIT, who had received funding from the Gates Foundation, published a paper about technology they developed that can keep a vaccination record on a patient’s skin with an ink-like injection that could be read by smartphone.	0
NewsClaims	22895	The technology does not have the capacity to track patients’ movements, Kevin McHugh, a Rice University bioengineering professor who worked on the study while at MIT, told FactCheck.org.	0
NewsClaims	22896	The Gates Foundation told FactCheck.org that the research is unrelated to COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	22897	Some versions of this conspiracy theory also assert that the purpose of the “tracking” vaccine is to control or reduce the world population, which is also false.	0
NewsClaims	22898	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	22899	According to FactCheck.org and BuzzFeed News, conspiracy theorists have distorted comments that Gates made during a March 18 Reddit forum.	0
NewsClaims	22900	Gates discussed “digital certificates,” a technology used to transmit encrypted information online, as part of a solution to expand COVID-19 testing.	0
NewsClaims	22901	However, conspiracy theorists claim that Gates was referring instead to the MIT research into skin-based vaccination records — which is not related to the “digital certificates” Gates was describing.	0
NewsClaims	22902	The website BioHackInfo.com published a story containing the false claims on March 19, 2020, the day after Gates’ Reddit forum, using the term “microchip,” which did not appear in either Gates’ statements or the research.	0
NewsClaims	22903	FactCheck.org and BuzzFeed News reported that the conspiracy theory was subsequently amplified by a YouTube video from the Jacksonville, Florida-based Law of Liberty Baptist Church, which received 1.9 million views as of publication.	0
NewsClaims	22904	MYTH: “Getting a flu shot increases your risk of getting COVID-19.”	0
NewsClaims	22905	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	22906	There is no evidence that the flu vaccine either increases or decreases the risk of being infected with the COVID-19 virus.	0
NewsClaims	22907	Studies cited to back this false claim, such as one published in the journal Vaccine in January 2020, did not mention the COVID-19 virus, having used data collected years before the virus emerged.	0
NewsClaims	22908	While some studies — including the research published in Vaccine — have found an association between the flu shot and non-influenza respiratory illnesses, such as the common cold, over the course of a single flu season, that association was not found in a larger study that included data from multiple seasons.	0
NewsClaims	22909	According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “the preponderance of evidence suggests that this is not a common or regular occurrence and that influenza vaccination does not, in fact, make people more susceptible to other respiratory infections.”	0
NewsClaims	22910	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	22911	DisabledVeterans.org, a news site that calls itself a “watchdog” of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, first promoted the claim in a March 11, 2020 article that cited the January 2020 Vaccine study.	0
NewsClaims	22912	The same study was cited in an April 16, 2020 article by Collective Evolution, a NewsGuard Red-rated conspiracy theory website that has more than 5 million followers on Facebook.	0
NewsClaims	22913	MYTH: “Wearing a face mask can cause hypercapnia, a condition of too much carbon dioxide”	0
NewsClaims	22914	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	22915	Hypercapnia is caused by having much carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, such as can be caused by underwater diving.	0
NewsClaims	22916	Health care workers who regularly wear face masks for long periods of time do not develop this condition.	0
NewsClaims	22917	According to health fact-checking website HealthFeedback.org, even surgical and N95 masks are porous enough to allow gas molecules such as carbon dioxide to pass through, while limiting exposure to the respiratory droplets that could spread the COVID-19 virus.	0
NewsClaims	22918	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	22919	The earliest example of this claim was an April 6, 2020 post from a Facebook user in Bangkok, Thailand, cited in a May 2020 article from Agence France-Presse.	0
NewsClaims	22920	English language posts promoting the same claim began circulating in Thailand and South Africa that same month, AFP reported.	0
NewsClaims	22921	MYTH: “Wearing a face mask will push the COVID-19 virus into your brain”	0
NewsClaims	22922	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	22923	There is no evidence that wearing a mask will cause the COVID-19 virus to enter the brain.	0
NewsClaims	22924	“Breathing out the virus is not going to appreciably change the amount that is there,” Sarah Stanley, an infectious diseases professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told The Associated Press in a May 2020 fact-checking article.	0
NewsClaims	22925	“Therefore, there should be no reason why wearing a mask would increase your chance of infection in the brain.”	0
NewsClaims	22926	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	22927	A May 11, 2020 article on NewsGuard Red-rated anti-technology website Technocracy.news from Dr. Russell Blaylock, a retired neurosurgeon, was the earliest example of this claim identified by NewsGuard.	0
NewsClaims	22928	Blaylock has previously promoted the debunked link between vaccines and autism in a health newsletter he edits for conservative news site Newsmax.com.	0
NewsClaims	22929	PJ Media, a Red-rated site that is among the top 70 news sites in the U.S. as measured by engagement, repeated Blaylock’s false face mask claims in a May 14 article.	0

NewsClaims	22938	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	22939	The institute explains on its website that in 2004, it patented a strategy to create a vaccine for another strain of the SARS coronavirus, which is not the virus responsible for the Covid-19 disease.	0
NewsClaims	22940	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	22941	As French media Le Monde and Sciences et Avenir have reported, this hoax started with a since-deleted video published on Facebook on March 17.	0

NewsClaims	22943	MYTH: “The French government authorized euthanasia in the middle of the crisis”	0
NewsClaims	22944	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	22945	In March 2020, the French government issued a decree that allowed doctors to temporarily use anti-epileptic drug Rivotril to alleviate pain for end-of-life patients in severe respiratory distress.	0
NewsClaims	22946	However, the decree did not authorize euthanasia or physician-assisted death.	0
NewsClaims	22947	There is no evidence that any patient in France was euthanized under these circumstances, and euthanasia is illegal in the country.	0
NewsClaims	22948	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	22949	First circulated on social media, this false claim was shared on April 7 on NewsGuard Red-rated anti-Islam website RiposteLaique.com.	0
NewsClaims	22950	A day later, it was promoted by French far-right website NS2017.wordpress.com.	0
NewsClaims	22951	On April 16, Red-rated French website BVoltaire.fr published an interview with a French medical doctor named Joëlle de Monredon claiming that the government’s move was “euthanasia and eugenics.” This interview was republished on April 18 by Contre-Info.com, a NewsGuard Red-rated website owned by a nonprofit connected with the Catholic nationalist organization Renouveau Français.	0

NewsClaims	22953	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	22954	As countries started lifting lockdowns, Google and Apple developed a tool for governments to build their own contact-tracing apps to curb the spread of the virus.	0
NewsClaims	22955	In their latest updates, smartphones from the two brands included this exposure notification system.	0
NewsClaims	22956	Some countries, like Italy, used this feature to build their national app, but others, like France, chose not to.	0
NewsClaims	22957	In countries where governments decided to use it, citizens still had to download the app first, and to activate the feature before it did anything.	0
NewsClaims	22958	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	22959	In Italy, NewsGuard Red-rated site ByoBlu.com claimed on May 26 that the Google feature had been automatically installed and activated on people’s phones.	0
NewsClaims	22960	In France, the Red-rated website LumiereSurGaia.com, a hub of coronavirus hoaxes and false information about topics such as UFOs and the environment, published on May 29 an article claiming that the French government had secretly installed its app on people’s phones, and encouraged users to uninstall it.	0
NewsClaims	22961	(At that time, the French government app had not even been released).	0
NewsClaims	22962	The false claim was then reposted on May 31 by Red-rated site ReseauInternational.net and, on June 1, by WikiStrike.com.	0
NewsClaims	22963	These three websites are among the most popular misinformation sites in France.	0
NewsClaims	22964	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	22965	This variation on the false claim that the COVID-19 virus is manmade relies on misrepresenting a study published in the journal Nature Medicine in 2015.	0
NewsClaims	22966	The research found that bat coronaviruses were capable of directly infecting humans, but it did not involve the same strain of coronavirus that causes COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	22967	The study authors included researchers from UNC as well as the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China.	0
NewsClaims	22968	A March 2020 editor’s note on the original study addressed the conspiracy theory.	0

NewsClaims	22970	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	22971	The earliest mention of this false claim found by NewsGuard was a story from ShadOlsonShow.com in late February.	0
NewsClaims	22972	Radio host Olson reported on his site that he was “First to reveal the links to the ‘gain of function’ coronavirus study by Dr. Ralph Baric at the University of North Carolina.” The claim received further attention when it was spread in a series of March 3, 2020 tweets from an account using the name Greg Rubini, which has 129,000 followers.	0
NewsClaims	22973	According to a June 2020 article from BuzzFeed News, the Twitter account is run by an Italian man named Gregorio Palusa, a sound engineer and marketer.	0
NewsClaims	22974	Palusa has no proven expertise in national security or intelligence, but conservative cable news network One America News brought this myth further into the mainstream by citing his tweets under the Greg Rubini pseudonym in a March 14 report, describing him as “a citizen investigator and monitored source amongst a certain set in the D.C. intelligence community,” according to liberal nonprofit Media Matters.	0

NewsClaims	22977	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	22978	There is no evidence that Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), has personal financial investments in vaccines being developed for COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	22979	Fauci’s agency is working with pharmaceutical company Moderna on a potential vaccine — one of 141 that are currently in development, according to the World Health Organization — but PolitiFact found no record of a business relationship between Fauci and Moderna in an April 2020 search of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s database.	0
NewsClaims	22980	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	22981	PolitiFact reported that the false accusation against Fauci was made in an April 12, 2020 post on an anti-vaccine Facebook page called I Am Awake, which has 13,000 likes on the platform.	0

NewsClaims	22990	This study comes on the heels of another recent report from Shenzen, China which found SARS- CoV-2 genetic material, not live virus capable of replication, on the surface of frozen chicken wings, a story recently covered by fellow Forbes contributor, Bruce Lee.	0
NewsClaims	22991	Needless to say, as Lee emphasizes, finding genetic material on the surface of food is not the same as finding live replicating virus.	0
NewsClaims	22992	This distinction is important because viruses are quite different than bacteria—they cannot survive on their own without a live host.	0
NewsClaims	22993	Besides, having even enough virus is even more crucial to risk of infection.	0
NewsClaims	22994	In fact, another recent report by Reuters also found the presence of viral genetic material on the outer packaging of frozen seafood in Yantai, China.	0
NewsClaims	22995	Even the possibility of aerosolization of fomites (virus on surfaces) while offered, is still quite remote and does not constitute the primary mode of transmission.	0
NewsClaims	22996	For the new study, the researchers inoculated 500 tiny individual cubes of salmon, chicken and pork from supermarkets in Singapore with a hefty dose of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles.	0

NewsClaims	23019	However it does not establish that this is may be a mode of possible transmission of Covid-19.	0

NewsClaims	23036	Gilead first partnered with hospitals around the country in February 2020 to run safety and efficacy trials of remdesivir as a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, and initiated two of its own Phase 3 studies.	0
NewsClaims	23037	The following month, a number of hospitals began enrolling patients infected with moderate to severe COVID-19 for the double-blind clinical trial, meaning neither the researchers nor the patients know who is getting the treatment and who is getting a placebo.	0

NewsClaims	23067	"""Whilst it is disappointing that there was no significant benefit from lopinavir-ritonavir for patients in hospital, these findings have allowed us to focus our efforts on other promising treatments, and have informed the way in which individual patients are treated."""	0
NewsClaims	23068	[1]	0
NewsClaims	23069	The authors also found that lopinavir-ritonavir did not reduce the length of patients' hospital stay, with 69% (1,113/1,616 patients) in the lopinavir-ritonavir group leaving hospital within 28 days, compared with 70% (2,382/3,424 patients) of those receiving usual care.	0
NewsClaims	23070	Both groups had a median stay of 11 days.	0
NewsClaims	23071	No significant difference was observed in the risk of needing to be placed on a ventilator, with 10% (152/1,556 patients) of those in the lopinavir-ritonavir group needing ventilation, compared with 9% (279/3,280 patients) in those receiving usual care.	0
NewsClaims	23072	Results were consistent across all patient subgroups - including age, sex and ethnicity - with no evidence of any benefit from lopinavir-ritonavir treatment.	0
NewsClaims	23073	The authors note that few patients who had undergone intubation - insertion of a tube into the airway to aid breathing using a ventilator - took part in the trial due to difficulties in giving the treatment to patients who could not swallow, and so it is not possible to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of lopinavir-ritonavir for mechanically ventilated patients.	0
NewsClaims	23074	Results from the large-scale RECOVERY clinical trial - combined with findings from an earlier, smaller trial and with the WHO interim results - provide strong evidence that lopinavir-ritonavir is not an effective treatment for patients hospitalised with COVID-19, and clinical care guidelines should be updated accordingly.	0
NewsClaims	23075	"Writing in a linked Comment, lead authors Bin Cao and Frederick G Hayden (who were not involved the study), from the China-Japan Friendship Hospital and Capital Medical University, China, and the University of Virginia School of Medicine, USA, say: ""Compared with the first randomised trial to investigate lopinavir-ritonavir in patients with COVID-19 by Cao and colleagues (including the authors of this Comment), the size of the lopinavir-ritonavir group in the RECOVERY trial was much larger and hence provides a more solid evidence base regarding possible lopinavir-ritonavir treatment effects."	0

NewsClaims	23139	These defendants had tried to appeal, but Judges Tito Gallego, Luis Legia, and Tony Changarei issued a delay, justifying it due to the “unpredictable” nature of the “pandemic.”	0
NewsClaims	23140	It was only predictable for ordinary people, however, as the alleged creators of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) “who have been involved in it and continue to manage it with particular secrecy in their environment” are entirely unaffected.	0
NewsClaims	23141	In fact, Bill Gates has never once been seen wearing a face mask, nor is he willing to take the vaccines he is now pushing everyone else to get for their “safety” and “protection” against the WuFlu.	0
NewsClaims	23142	“No world government, individuals or legal entities, nor the defense of the accused can claim that this pandemic has the quality of ‘foresight,’ except for the creators of the new world order, such as Bill Gates, Soros, Rockefeller, etc.,” the magistrates wrote in their resolution, which was posted to the LP Law portal.	0

NewsClaims	23146	Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Gates et al.	0
NewsClaims	23147	The document specifically names billionaire financier and globalist agitator George Soros, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, and the entire Rockefeller family as criminals who are guilty of “managing” and “continuing to direct” the virus straight into the “new world order.”	0

NewsClaims	23150	for their many crimes against humanity and punish them accordingly.	0

NewsClaims	23162	Exposure occurs in three principal ways: (1) inhalation of very fine respiratory droplets and aerosol particles, (2) deposition of respiratory droplets and particles on exposed mucous membranes in the mouth, nose, or eye by direct splashes and sprays, and (3) touching mucous membranes with hands that have been soiled either directly by virus-containing respiratory fluids or indirectly by touching surfaces with virus on them.	0
NewsClaims	23163	The largest droplets settle out of the air rapidly, within seconds to minutes.	0
NewsClaims	23164	The smallest very fine droplets, and aerosol particles formed when these fine droplets rapidly dry, are small enough that they can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours.	0
NewsClaims	23165	Infectious exposures to respiratory fluids carrying SARS-CoV-2 occur in three principal ways (not mutually exclusive):	0
NewsClaims	23166	Inhalation of air carrying very small fine droplets and aerosol particles that contain infectious virus.	0
NewsClaims	23167	Risk of transmission is greatest within three to six feet of an infectious source where the concentration of these very fine droplets and particles is greatest.	0
NewsClaims	23168	Deposition of virus carried in exhaled droplets and particles onto exposed mucous membranes (i.e., “splashes and sprays”, such as being coughed on).	0
NewsClaims	23169	Touching mucous membranes with hands soiled by exhaled respiratory fluids containing virus or from touching inanimate surfaces contaminated with virus.	0
NewsClaims	23170	The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection varies according to the amount of virus to which a person is exposed	0
NewsClaims	23171	Once infectious droplets and particles are exhaled, they move outward from the source.	0
NewsClaims	23172	The risk for infection decreases with increasing distance from the source and increasing time after exhalation.	0
NewsClaims	23173	Two principal processes determine the amount of virus to which a person is exposed in the air or by touching a surface contaminated by virus:	0
NewsClaims	23174	Decreasing concentration of virus in the air as larger and heavier respiratory droplets containing virus fall to the ground or other surfaces under the force of gravity and the very fine droplets and aerosol particles that remain in the airstream progressively mix with, and become diluted within, the growing volume and streams of air they encounter.	0
NewsClaims	23175	This mixing is not necessarily uniform and can be influenced by thermal layering and initial jetting of exhalations.	0
NewsClaims	23176	Progressive loss of viral viability and infectiousness over time influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and ultraviolet radiation (e.g., sunlight).	0
NewsClaims	23177	With increasing distance from the source, the role of inhalation likewise increases.	0
NewsClaims	23178	Per published reports, factors that increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection under these circumstances include:	0
NewsClaims	23179	Enclosed spaces with inadequate ventilation or air handling within which the concentration of exhaled respiratory fluids, especially very fine droplets and aerosol particles, can build-up in the air space.	0
NewsClaims	23180	within which the concentration of exhaled respiratory fluids, especially very fine droplets and aerosol particles, can build-up in the air space.	0
NewsClaims	23181	Increased exhalation of respiratory fluids if the infectious person is engaged in physical exertion or raises their voice (e.g., exercising, shouting, singing).	0
NewsClaims	23182	of respiratory fluids if the infectious person is engaged in physical exertion or raises their voice (e.g., exercising, shouting, singing).	0
NewsClaims	23183	Prolonged exposure to these conditions, typically more than 15 minutes.	0
NewsClaims	23184	Prevention of COVID-19 transmission	0
NewsClaims	23185	The infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2 needed to transmit infection has not been established.	0
NewsClaims	23186	Although animal studies22-24 and epidemiologic investigations25 (in addition to those described above) indicate that inhalation of virus can cause infection, the relative contributions of inhalation of virus and deposition of virus on mucous membranes remain unquantified and will be difficult to establish.	0
NewsClaims	23187	Despite these knowledge gaps, the available evidence continues to demonstrate that existing recommendations to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission remain effective.	0
NewsClaims	23188	These include physical distancing, community use of well-fitting masks (e.g., barrier face coverings, procedure/surgical masks), adequate ventilation, and avoidance of crowded indoor spaces.	0
NewsClaims	23189	These methods will reduce transmission both from inhalation of virus and deposition of virus on exposed mucous membranes.	0

NewsClaims	23192	Here’s how long it takes to get infected	0
NewsClaims	23193	Issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and adopted by many businesses, it’s the guideline that most of us have lived by during COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	23194	Because when you’re inside, microscopic droplets are trapped right alongside you in a confined space, and standing six feet away from someone doesn’t stop the SARS-CoV-2 virus from floating in the air of your living room where you can potentially inhale it.	0

NewsClaims	23198	Bush, alongside his MIT colleague Martin Z.	0
NewsClaims	23199	Bazant, have answered that question with a complex mathematical model, which simulates the fluid dynamics of virus-loaded respiratory droplets in any space, from a cozy kitchen to a gigantic concert hall.	0
NewsClaims	23200	And because the equation is far too complicated for most people to understand, they turned their findings into a free online tool.	0
NewsClaims	23201	Go to this website, and you can create your own custom scenario to judge COVID-19 risks for yourself.	0
NewsClaims	23202	[Image: COVID-19 Indoor Safety Guideline]	0
NewsClaims	23203	The tool assumes one person in a room with you has COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	23204	Then, it hands you an incredible amount of control to tweak the variables at play.	0
NewsClaims	23205	These variables include details about the building: What’s the square footage?	0
NewsClaims	23206	What’s the height of the ceiling?	0
NewsClaims	23207	How about the HVAC system—is it a standard domestic furnace or does it have a fancy HEPA filter?	0
NewsClaims	23208	What’s the humidity?	0
NewsClaims	23209	Is a window open?	0
NewsClaims	23210	The variables also include all sorts of details about human behavior: How many other people are there with you?	0
NewsClaims	23211	Are they wearing masks?	0
NewsClaims	23212	Cotton or surgical?	0
NewsClaims	23213	Do they wear masks properly or pull them down their face a bit?	0
NewsClaims	23214	Are they whispering or singing?	0
NewsClaims	23215	At first glance, all of these controls might seem overwhelming.	0
NewsClaims	23216	(And they are!)	0
NewsClaims	23217	But the payoff is worth it.	0
NewsClaims	23218	Because the tool gives you a very clear answer of how long how many people can safely be in a space together.	0
NewsClaims	23219	Let’s try an example.	0
NewsClaims	23220	You just enjoyed Thanksgiving dinner in a typical 20-foot-by-20-foot dining room with a group of 10 people.	0
NewsClaims	23221	People talked normally.	0
NewsClaims	23222	Nobody was wearing masks since they were eating.	0
NewsClaims	23223	The air was of average humidity.	0
NewsClaims	23224	"""Based on this model, it should be safe for this room to have: 10 people for 18 minutes."""	0
NewsClaims	23225	If you had simply followed a six-foot distance guideline and worn a mask, as the CDC suggests, these guests would be safe hanging out indefinitely.	0
NewsClaims	23226	Which is clearly nonsensical.	0
NewsClaims	23227	"""But what if they were wearing masks?"""	0
NewsClaims	23228	you ask.	0
NewsClaims	23229	Good question.	0
NewsClaims	23230	Let’s assume no one ate and instead talked through coarse cotton masks.	0
NewsClaims	23231	It buys another six minutes.	0
NewsClaims	23232	But with a catch: If those surgical masks are worn improperly by half of the people—say, the masks fit loosely or the wearers’ noses are sticking out—the safe time plummets back down to 32 minutes.	0
NewsClaims	23233	Human factors matter a lot.	0
NewsClaims	23234	"After working on the source math behind this tool, Bush concludes that we absolutely should because it’s the most ""dramatic"" effect he noticed; it moves the needle in any circumstance, buying you precious minutes to stay safe."	0
NewsClaims	23235	However, masks are not hazmat suits.	0
NewsClaims	23236	They cannot overcome the reality of being in a small space with other people.	0
NewsClaims	23237	To prove the point, let’s make that dining room bigger.	0
NewsClaims	23238	In fact, let’s stretch it into a 180,000-square-foot Walmart.	0
NewsClaims	23239	And let’s fill it with 1,000 people who are good about wearing their coarse cotton masks.	0
NewsClaims	23240	The only other variable I’m changing is that the air is probably a bit drier than in your home.	0
NewsClaims	23241	In these conditions, the tool says people should be safe for 68 minutes—if only	0
NewsClaims	23242	one	0
NewsClaims	23243	person has COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	23244	Just keep this in mind: Where I live, around Chicago, as many as 1 in 15 people currently have COVID-19, so as many as 66 people in that Walmart could have COVID-19 out of 1,000.	0
NewsClaims	23245	Here, we run into a shortcoming of the tool.	0
NewsClaims	23246	It models a single sick person in a space, not what happens when real infection rates hit what they are now.	0
NewsClaims	23247	And there’s no way to tweak it accordingly.	0
NewsClaims	23248	Obviously this is just a model.	0
NewsClaims	23249	It’s a simulation—researchers’ best guess of how our world works.	0
NewsClaims	23250	It isn’t perfect and cannot guarantee your safety in any situation.	0
NewsClaims	23251	But after using this MIT tool for more than an hour, I went from feeling comforted to feeling like things are even less safe than I thought.	0

NewsClaims	23453	We then found that a short region of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) from a bat coronavirus (BatCoV RaTG13)—which was previously detected in Rhinolophus affinis from Yunnan province—showed high sequence identity to 2019-nCoV.	0
NewsClaims	23454	We carried out full-length sequencing on this RNA sample (GISAID accession number EPI_ISL_402131).	0
NewsClaims	23455	Simplot analysis showed that 2019-nCoV was highly similar throughout the genome to RaTG13 (Fig.	0

NewsClaims	23463	The S genes of 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 are longer than other SARSr-CoVs.	0
NewsClaims	23464	The major differences in the sequence of the S gene of 2019-nCoV are the three short insertions in the N-terminal domain as well as changes in four out of five of the key residues in the receptor-binding motif compared with the sequence of SARS-CoV (Extended Data Fig.	0
NewsClaims	23465	3).	0
NewsClaims	23466	Whether the insertions in the N-terminal domain of the S protein of 2019-nCoV confer sialic-acid-binding activity as it does in MERS-CoV needs to be further studied.	0
NewsClaims	23467	The close phylogenetic relationship to RaTG13 provides evidence that 2019-nCoV may have originated in bats.	0

NewsClaims	23490	5) and showed no cross-reactivity against other human coronaviruses except SARSr-CoV7.	0
NewsClaims	23491	We were only able to obtain five serum samples from the seven patients with viral infections.	0
NewsClaims	23492	We monitored viral antibody levels in one patient (ICU-06) 7, 8, 9 and 18 days after the onset of disease (Extended Data Table 2).	0
NewsClaims	23493	A clear trend was observed in the IgG and IgM titres, which increased over time, except that the IgM titre was decreased in the last sample (Fig.	0
NewsClaims	23494	2b).	0
NewsClaims	23495	As a second analysis, we tested samples from 5 of the 7 virus-positive patients around 20 days after disease onset for the presence of viral antibodies (Extended Data Tables 1, 2).	0
NewsClaims	23496	All patient samples—but not samples from healthy individuals—were strongly positive for viral IgG (Fig.	0
NewsClaims	23497	2b).	0
NewsClaims	23498	There were also three IgM-positive samples, indicating an acute infection.	0
NewsClaims	23499	We next successfully isolated the virus (called 2019-nCoV BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019) from both Vero E6 and Huh7 cells using the BALF sample of patient ICU-06.	0
NewsClaims	23500	Clear cytopathogenic effects were observed in cells after incubation for three days (Extended Data Fig.	0
NewsClaims	23501	6a, b).	0
NewsClaims	23502	The identity of the strain WIV04 was verified in Vero E6 cells by immunofluorescence microscopy using the cross-reactive viral N antibody (Extended Data Fig.	0
NewsClaims	23503	6c, d) and by metagenomics sequencing, most of the reads of which mapped to 2019-nCoV, and qPCR analysis showed that the viral load increased from day 1 to day 3 (Extended Data Fig.	0
NewsClaims	23504	6e, f).	0
NewsClaims	23505	Viral particles in ultrathin sections of infected cells displayed a typical coronavirus morphology, as visualized by electron microscopy (Extended Data Fig.	0
NewsClaims	23506	6g).	0
NewsClaims	23507	To further confirm the neutralization activity of the viral IgG-positive samples, we conducted serum-neutralization assays in Vero E6 cells using the five patient sera that were IgG-positive.	0
NewsClaims	23508	We demonstrate that all samples were able to neutralize 100 TCID 50 (50% tissue-culture-infective dose) of 2019-nCoV at a dilution of 1:40–1:80.	0
NewsClaims	23509	We also show that this virus could be cross-neutralized by horse anti-SARS-CoV serum (gift from L.-F. Wang) at dilutions of 1:40; however, the potential for cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV antibodies needs to be confirmed with anti-SARS-CoV serum from humans (Extended Data Table 4).	0
NewsClaims	23510	ACE2 is known to be a cell receptor for SARS-CoV14.	0
NewsClaims	23511	To determine whether 2019-nCoV also uses ACE2 as a cellular entry receptor, we conducted virus infectivity studies using HeLa cells that expressed or did not express ACE2 proteins from humans, Chinese horseshoe bats, civets, pigs and mice.	0
NewsClaims	23512	We show that 2019-nCoV is able to use all ACE2 proteins, except for mouse ACE2, as an entry receptor to enter ACE2-expressing cells, but not cells that did not express ACE2, indicating that ACE2 is probably the cell receptor through which 2019-nCoV enters cells (Fig.	0
NewsClaims	23513	3).	0
NewsClaims	23514	We also show that 2019-nCoV does not use other coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidase N (APN) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) (Extended Data Fig.	0

NewsClaims	23524	The study provides a detailed report on 2019-nCoV, the likely aetiological agent responsible for the ongoing epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in China and other countries.	0
NewsClaims	23525	Virus-specific nucleotide-positive and viral-protein seroconversion was observed in all patients tested and provides evidence of an association between the disease and the presence of this virus.	0
NewsClaims	23526	However, there are still many urgent questions that remain to be answered.	0
NewsClaims	23527	The association between 2019-nCoV and the disease has not been verified by animal experiments to fulfil the Koch’s postulates to establish a causative relationship between a microorganism and a disease.	0
NewsClaims	23528	We do not yet know the transmission routine of this virus among hosts.	0
NewsClaims	23529	We should closely monitor whether the virus continues to evolve to become more virulent.	0
NewsClaims	23530	Finally, considering the wide spread of SARSr-CoV in their natural reservoirs, future research should be focused on active surveillance of these viruses for broader geographical regions.	0
NewsClaims	23531	In the long term, broad-spectrum antiviral drugs and vaccines should be prepared for emerging infectious diseases that are caused by this cluster of viruses in the future.	0
NewsClaims	23532	Most importantly, strict regulations against the domestication and consumption of wildlife should be implemented.	0
NewsClaims	23533	Note added in proof: Since this paper was accepted, the ICTV has designated the virus as SARS-CoV-215; in addition, the WHO has released the official name of the disease caused by this virus, which is COVID-1916.	0

NewsClaims	23536	A previously unknown variant of coronavirus that appeared in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019 has already infected thousands of people, with cases confirmed in at least 20 countries.	0
NewsClaims	23537	So far, their efforts have gained very little traction.	0
NewsClaims	23538	The practice of spreading disinformation about public health threats is nothing new.	0
NewsClaims	23539	"Experiments."""	0
NewsClaims	23540	Over several years, the false narrative was picked up by other media, before eventually making its way to the United States, including CBS Evening News.	0
NewsClaims	23541	In 1992, Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service admitted that Operation Infektion had been backed by the KGB.	0
NewsClaims	23542	A similar pattern of spreading disinformation appears to be evolving alongside the current outbreak.	0
NewsClaims	23543	While it is not as far along as Operation Infektion, the mechanisms available to spread narratives quickly are much larger and faster in today’s media environment than they were during the Cold War.	0
NewsClaims	23544	Multiple narratives get things rolling	0
NewsClaims	23545	The economic version of the narrative, published by Topcor.ru, suggested that the ongoing trade war with China has cost the U.S. billions of dollars, and the latter would benefit from the virus undermining the former’s economy.	0
NewsClaims	23546	The fringe outlet suggested that the outbreak is essentially a U.S. bioweaponry reconnaissance operation with the goal of testing the capabilities of Chinese biological weapons defenses.	0
NewsClaims	23547	Additional outlets referred to statements by pro-Kremlin military expert Igor Nikulin on	0
NewsClaims	23548	TV Zvezda	0
NewsClaims	23549	, who claimed that the appearance of the virus looked like sabotage.	0
NewsClaims	23550	According to Nikulin, the United States actively researches lethal disease vectors to test them within a population while simultaneously developing cures for them.	0

NewsClaims	23571	While Operation Infektion took years to spread, ultimately it sowed doubt regarding the origins of the AIDS virus.	0

NewsClaims	23576	All rights reserved.	0
NewsClaims	23577	Social media posts claim children vaccinated against the flu are at a significantly higher risk of contracting other respiratory infections, including coronaviruses.	0
NewsClaims	23578	This is false; large studies in British Columbia and the US found no evidence that the influenza vaccine increases the risk of contracting a coronavirus, and health officials throughout North America recommend the flu vaccine for children during the COVID-19 pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	23579	“Bombshell as flu shots found to cause huge increases in coronavirus infections,” says the headline of an article shared as a screenshot on July 31, 2020 on Facebook.	0
NewsClaims	23580	“Children who are vaccinated with flu shots have a 440 percent increase in risk of contradicting other respiratory infections such as coronavirus, researchers found in a published paper,” claims the post, which also circulated on Instagram.	0
NewsClaims	23581	Screenshot of a Facebook post taken on August 3, 2020	0
NewsClaims	23582	Several posts claim the evidence came from “The British Medical Journal,” sharing this link.	0
NewsClaims	23583	However, that is not a scientific study, but rather a response to an article about the COVID-19 pandemic from a retired pediatrician.	0
NewsClaims	23584	BMJ executive editor Theodora Bloom explained in an email that “Rapid responses” are comments to the editors that appear on the journal’s website but “are not indexed in PubMed and they are not journal articles.”	0
NewsClaims	23585	“Although we moderate Rapid Responses to ensure they are not libellous, for example, they are certainly not endorsed by the publication,” she said.	0
NewsClaims	23586	Another version of the post reveals that the source of the claim is an article on the website NaturalNews, one of a network of internet domains found to host health disinformation which AFP has fact-checked in the past.	0
NewsClaims	23587	NaturalNews was removed from Facebook in May 2020 “for spammy and abusive behavior, not the content they posted,” according to a Facebook spokeswoman.	0
NewsClaims	23588	“They misled people about the popularity of their posts and relied on content farms in Macedonia and the Philippines.”	0
NewsClaims	23589	Screenshot of a Facebook post taken on August 3, 2020	0
NewsClaims	23590	Brian Ward, professor in the McGill University Department of Medicine, said in an email that the claim has been “cherry-picked from a very weak study.”	0
NewsClaims	23591	It is based on a 2012 study titled: “Increased Risk of Noninfluenza Respiratory Virus Infections Associated With Receipt of Inactivated Influenza Vaccine.”	0
NewsClaims	23592	The study was conducted from 2008-2009, a decade before the novel coronavirus pandemic, and only included 115 children during one flu season.	0
NewsClaims	23593	It found that over nine months, the children in the group that received trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine “had an increased risk of virologically-confirmed non-influenza infections.”	0
NewsClaims	23594	Ward explained that the study, though published in Clinical Infectious Diseases, has methodological flaws, including having 1.5 times more children in the flu vaccine group, compared to the placebo group.	0
NewsClaims	23595	Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the University of Oxford’s Nuffield Department of Medicine, also said in an email that it is important not to overstate the findings of a small study.	0
NewsClaims	23596	Gilbert further explained: “It isn’t that the flu shot directly made children more susceptible to other viruses.”	0
NewsClaims	23597	She said the children in the placebo group who were not vaccinated were more likely to get the flu and there seemed to be short-term protection from other viruses right after recovering from the flu.	0
NewsClaims	23598	Based on this study, “no-one should make decisions to avoid flu vaccinations,” Gilbert said.	0
NewsClaims	23599	Flu shot and coronavirus risk	0
NewsClaims	23600	Danuta Skowronski, the principal investigator at the British Columbia Center for Disease Control (BCCDC), published a study in May 2020 that included thousands of people over multiple flu seasons in Canada.	0
NewsClaims	23601	It found the “influenza vaccine did not affect seasonal coronavirus risk.”	0
NewsClaims	23602	Skowronski, who plays a critical role in Canada’s national influenza program, helped develop test negative design, a methodology used worldwide to monitor how well the influenza vaccine protects.	0
NewsClaims	23603	Asked if there was any particular coronavirus risk to children who receive the flu shot, Skowronski said: “We saw no association in children nor in adults between the receipt of influenza vaccine and coronavirus risk.”	0
NewsClaims	23604	Similarly, a 2013 study conducted in the US state of Wisconsin covering six flu seasons and including more than 3,000 patients found: “Influenza vaccination was not associated with detection of noninfluenza respiratory viruses.”	0
NewsClaims	23605	Claims that a 2017 study also found the flu shot left people vulnerable to infections were also shown to be misleading by AFP Fact Check here.	0
NewsClaims	23606	Flu shot recommended	0
NewsClaims	23607	The US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has not yet voted on the flu vaccine recommendations for 2020-2021, but Lisa Black, a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), said in an email that AAP has not changed its guidance because of the pandemic and “recommends that everyone over 6 months is vaccinated for influenza.”	0
NewsClaims	23608	The same is true of the Canadian Paediatric Society.	0
NewsClaims	23609	Spokeswoman Genevieve Brouillette said in an email: “Our general guidance (that everyone over 6 months of age be immunized against the seasonal flu) won’t be changing.”	0
NewsClaims	23610	The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that how and where people get a flu vaccine may need to change due to the COVID-19 pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	23611	The flu shot is a regular target of disinformation.	0
NewsClaims	23612	AFP Fact Check has debunked the false claim that the vaccine contains coronaviruses, the false claim that receiving a flu shot will make you test positive for COVID-19, and false ingredient lists for the annual immunization.	0
NewsClaims	23613	Note: The objective of this report is to provide a snapshot overview of the current trends and insights into disinformation activities related to COVID-19/Coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	23614	It does not provide a comprehensive or complete overview and focusses primarily on the external dimension, in line with the European External Action Service (eeas) mandate.	0
NewsClaims	23615	The report was authored by the EEAS Strategic Communications and Information Analysis Division, which contributes to the EU’s efforts to counter disinformation, including through detection, analysis and exposure of disinformation campaigns.	0
NewsClaims	23616	In addressing disinformation and identifying and analysing disinformation surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak, the EEAS is working closely with the European Commission, European Parliament services and EU Member States.	0
NewsClaims	23617	The EEAS also cooperates on this issue with international partners (G7, NATO and non-state actors).	0
NewsClaims	23618	The results are regularly published on EUvsDisinfo.eu and social media channels.	0
NewsClaims	23619	Insights are shared with EU institutions and EU Member States in real time, including through the Rapid Alert System on Disinformation.	0
NewsClaims	23620	SUMMARY	0
NewsClaims	23621	In line with the previous EEAS Special Reports and based on publicly available information, this edition gives an overview of recent developments around COVID-19 related disinformation.	0
NewsClaims	23622	The report focusses on foreign state and non-state actors trying to exploit the uncertainty in societies as well as people’s fears and insecurities to advance their own agenda.	0
NewsClaims	23623	While misinformation and disinformation[1] relating to issues surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic have continued to spread across the globe, the volume has – according to our findings – shown at least a temporary decrease during the period observed, alongside a general downward trend on COVID-19 related web searches[2].	0
NewsClaims	23624	There is a crystallizing and clustering around specific topics and narratives: alleged links between COVID-19 and 5G networks; COVID-19 restrictions as pretext establishing global domination of secretive elites; and attacks on individuals engaged in the development of vaccines, especially Bill Gates.	0
NewsClaims	23625	External actors, notably pro-Kremlin sources, are still involved in spreading disinformation, including by amplifying existing conspiracy theories, which link the COVID-19 pandemic to biological warfare, 5G technology and fuel anti-vaccination sentiment.	0
NewsClaims	23626	The efforts of state actors like China to deflect blame, to use the pandemic to promote their own governmental system and enhance their image abroad continue.	0
NewsClaims	23627	The claim that there are clandestine US biological laboratories on the territory of “former Soviet republics”[3] has been spread both by pro-Kremlin outlets as well as Chinese officials and state media.	0
NewsClaims	23628	Disinformation around COVID-19 has real world consequences.	0
NewsClaims	23629	It has become clear that disinformation is not just a potential health risk when false cures are propagated.	0
NewsClaims	23630	The spread of false information pertaining to the 5G network has also led to multiple arson attacks on telecommunication infrastructure across Europe.	0
NewsClaims	23631	[4]	0
NewsClaims	23632	In some regions and countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is used to restrict freedom of speech and freedom of the media.	0
NewsClaims	23633	The EEAS has observed numerous cases in which governments or state officials have used the crisis to curtail media freedoms.	0
NewsClaims	23634	The work of independent media and fact-checkers is crucial to deliver reliable and authoritative information about the pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	23635	Continued threats and harassment against fact-checkers and fact-checking organisations are being observed.	0
NewsClaims	23636	Social media companies continue to invest into detecting and countering misinformation and disinformation on their platforms.	0
NewsClaims	23637	While the efforts are commendable, it is clear that much more needs to be done.	0
NewsClaims	23638	In detail: COVID-19 related disinformation, propaganda and other activities (April 23 – 18 May)	0
NewsClaims	23639	Disinformation and propaganda around COVID-19	0
NewsClaims	23640	As the previous reports, this one focusses specifically on recent activities related to foreign state and non-state actors.	0
NewsClaims	23641	Foreign actors have been trying to exploit citizens’ fears, insecurities and concerns for their own agenda, which must be distinguished from the legitimate democratic debate where citizens voice concerns and criticism in connection with the pandemic and measures taken by governments	0
NewsClaims	23642	The information environment relating to COVID-19 continues to be crowded with disinformation and while many of the targets (the West as such, the EU and NATO, the United States) and themes remain the same, new targets have emerged, notably Bill and Melinda Gates and the Gates Foundation.	0
NewsClaims	23643	Pro-Kremlin media outlets continue to disinform about COVID-19, however the intensity of the disinformation campaign seems to have decreased[5].	0
NewsClaims	23644	Overall, the EUvsDisinfo database now contains nearly 500 examples of COVID-19-related pro-Kremlin disinformation.	0
NewsClaims	23645	Although pro-Kremlin disinformation messages about EU actions in response to COVID-19 and EU solidarity continue to circulate, at least three English-language pro-Kremlin outlets reduced the number of COVID-19 related articles since the second half of April, compared to late March and the beginning of April.	0
NewsClaims	23646	One of those outlets, “South Front”[6], has even removed a dedicated section on COVID-19 from its website.	0
NewsClaims	23647	According to recent reports in Dutch media[7], the General Intelligence and Security service of the Netherlands has determined that Russian narratives about COVID-19 were shared in a number of Dutch-speaking social media groups.	0
NewsClaims	23648	The narratives emphasized alleged lack of European solidarity in the field of COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	23649	Such findings are largely consistent with prominent pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about COVID-19, reported by EUvsDisinfo.eu.	0
NewsClaims	23650	Inside Russia, state-controlled channels continue to report on the domestic situation, acknowledging that COVID-19 is a complex challenge, including for Russia.	0
NewsClaims	23651	At the same time, some state-controlled media outlets continue to spread false information about Bill Gates and vaccines; however in at least one case another state-run media outlet has called this out as “conspiracy theories” and challenged it[8].	0
NewsClaims	23652	Russia’s state-controlled TV channels also used the broader COVID-19 situation to advance earlier-established disinformation narratives about the collapse of “perverse” Western values[9] (i.e.	0
NewsClaims	23653	no one in Europe demands gay parades anymore) and abandonment of Ukraine (“the West have disposed of Ukraine like trash”)[10].	0
NewsClaims	23654	In line with our previous analysis, China’s general aim of controlling the narrative on COVID-19 and deflecting any criticism of the country is still present.	0
NewsClaims	23655	China – “having made sacrifices to buy time for the rest of the world”[11] – is portrayed as a responsible and transparent actor in the pandemic and a model for other countries to follow.	0
NewsClaims	23656	In parallel, where established facts or prevailing narratives could be seen as unfavourable to China or could support criticism of Chinese authorities there seems to be the effort of creating doubt in relation to those.	0
NewsClaims	23657	For example, creating doubts about China’s role in the COVID-19 outbreak[12] and countering international calls for an independent inquiry into the origins of the outbreak of the virus in China[13].	0
NewsClaims	23658	At the same time, there has been a shift towards more directly challenging and mocking[14] the US administration and its response to the pandemic[15].	0
NewsClaims	23659	China’s state-run media has been implying a US cover-up[16] and demanding answers from the country[17].	0
NewsClaims	23660	Multiple Russian state-controlled media channels, including RIA Novosti news agency and RT[18], explicitly defended China in face of international criticism of handing the COVID-19 outbreak.	0
NewsClaims	23661	EU-sanctioned TV host and media manager Dmitry Kiselyov compared criticism of the Chinese government to Russia being held responsible for the chemical attack in Salisbury[19] and meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections[20] – referring to two prominent pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives.	0
NewsClaims	23662	Multiple pro-Kremlin outlets have reported (in Russian, French and English) about alleged clandestine US biological laboratories in Ukraine.	0
NewsClaims	23663	The implication behind such disinformation messages is that the US is afraid of leakage[21] of infectious substances on its own territory, that such labs facilitated the US support for Euromaidan[22] that epidemics[23] start around the labs, and more directly that COVID-19 might have been created in one of the labs in Ukraine[24].	0
NewsClaims	23664	These type of messages build on a prominent pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the “secret military laboratories”, most notably in the case of Lugar lab in Georgia.	0
NewsClaims	23665	As such, they are easily replicated throughout the region: in Armenia, Georgia, Moldova[25].	0
NewsClaims	23666	The same conspiracy theory about US biological laboratories in former Soviet republics has been also spread by Chinese officials and state media.	0
NewsClaims	23667	This started with statements of a Russian Foreign ministry spokesperson[26] in mid-April, which were later referred to by a Chinese MFA spokesperson[27].	0
NewsClaims	23668	It has been tweeted more than once by an official account of the Chinese MFA[28] and covered by China’s state-run media[29].	0
NewsClaims	23669	RT Russian in turn published an article quoting concerns[30] of a representative of China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs about these alleged laboratories[31].	0
NewsClaims	23670	The messaging by Chinese officials and media talk about the need to address “concerns from local people and surrounding countries” or “international concerns”.	0
NewsClaims	23671	The US biolab theory has become embedded into Chinese state media articles implying a wider cover-up by the US[32].	0
NewsClaims	23672	Nature magazine has reported[33] that Chinese state media[34] and officials[35] have been heavily promoting unproven traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) as treatments for COVID-19, including highlighting the sending of TCM to third countries as international aid.	0
NewsClaims	23673	[36] However, there is currently no scientific proof of any medicine preventing or curing COVID-19, a fact also confirmed by the WHO[37].	0
NewsClaims	23674	Freedom House has stated in their overview of Chinese activities[38] that “since March, coordinated and covert attempts by China-linked actors to manipulate information—particularly regarding COVID-19” have been detected in a number of countries, with content often delivered in local languages.	0
NewsClaims	23675	The analysis also highlights a departure from Beijing’s more traditional model of positive propaganda combined with suppression of criticism.	0
NewsClaims	23676	That expanding nature of the Chinese influence toolbox – including a more confrontational tone and “Russian-style disinformation tactics” – has been also noted by other analysts[39] and illustrated by various cases[40] mentioned in our current and previous reports.	0
NewsClaims	23677	The Syrian regime is further advancing its disinformation campaign against sanctions claiming that Western countries are perpetrating an “economic war” against Syria and the Syrian people and that sanctions have crippled the health sector and are impeding the country’s response to COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	23678	This was reiterated by Assad claiming that COVID-19 comes in addition to “an economic challenge, which we have been facing as a result of over nine years and unjust sanctions imposed on our people”[41].	0
NewsClaims	23679	Prior to that, the regime’s political representative to the UN further advanced this narrative at a meeting of the UNSC on the humanitarian situation in Syria, claiming that “illegitimate economic measures prevent the medical and health bodies in Syria to obtain the necessary equipment for the test, diagnosis and prevention and treatment of COVID-19”.	0
NewsClaims	23680	[42]	0
NewsClaims	23681	Terrorist groups have been calling for an opportunistic use of the chaos and distraction caused by COVID-19 to perpetrate attacks.	0
NewsClaims	23682	This narrative has raised security and stability implications since it materialised in an increased number of attacks in conflict areas (e.g.	0
NewsClaims	23683	Syria, Iraq) widely reported in the media[43].	0
NewsClaims	23684	When it comes to adverse narratives, the Global Coalition noted that COVID-19 is being described by Da’esh as a retribution for its activities in Iraq and Syria.	0
NewsClaims	23685	An intense appearance of COVID-19 related mis- and disinformation was observed across the Western Balkans, together with an increased activity of local fact-checkers contributing to awareness raising and opening public debate on the issue both locally and internationally.	0
NewsClaims	23686	Local independent fact-checkers are confirming cases of the spread of pseudo-science, conspiracy theories etc., including in relation to health advice and to the alleged impact of 5G networks on COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	23687	[44]	0
NewsClaims	23688	Bill Gates[45] and the Gates Foundation have been attacked by multiple actors throughout the last months.	0
NewsClaims	23689	Similar to other private organisations, they are accused of sinister intentions, like seeking global domination[46].	0
NewsClaims	23690	Building on top of these accusations, multilateral initiatives like the Global Pledging effort[47], which partners with private actors, are accused of generating money not for the fight against COVID-19, but to further their private interests.	0
NewsClaims	23691	The COVID-19 pandemic is also used to undermine NATO presence in the Baltic States[48].	0
NewsClaims	23692	A sophisticated influence operation, jointly targeting NATO, media, fact-checkers and state-institutions in the Baltic States[49], is an example of how the pandemic is instrumentalised in attempts to sow distrust among Western partners and intimidate individual voices of the press.	0
NewsClaims	23693	The disinformation narratives used in such influence operations are consistent with those in pro-Kremlin media outlets, as observed by EUvsDisinfo[50].	0
NewsClaims	23694	Update: Social media platforms	0
NewsClaims	23695	Actions taken by the platforms	0
NewsClaims	23696	Twitter announced it would grant researchers access to a real-time data stream of “tens of millions of daily public tweets about COVID-19”, to track misinformation and disinformation.	0
NewsClaims	23697	Twitter said that any developer or researcher with an approved Twitter developer account can apply for access to the COVID-19 stream if they meet certain criteria and the data is used for “the public good.” Twitter said it had never offered a full stream on a particular topic before.	0
NewsClaims	23698	[51] Additionally, Twitter announced that they are introducing “new labels and warning messages that will provide additional context and information on some Tweets containing disputed or misleading information related to COVID-19”.	0
NewsClaims	23699	[52]	0
NewsClaims	23700	Facebook announced in their April 2020 Coordinated Inauthentic Behaviour Report[53] that it took down 8 networks for coordinated inauthentic behaviour in April.	0
NewsClaims	23701	Six of them (in the US, Georgia, Myanmar and Mauritania) focussed on domestic audiences.	0
NewsClaims	23702	However, the other two were taken down for foreign interference, with one network emanating from Russia, and one from Iran.	0
NewsClaims	23703	Facebook[54] removed numerous assets of outlets “News Front”[55] and “South Front”[56] (followed by over 270 thousand users) for coordinated inauthentic behaviour on behalf of a foreign entity.	0
NewsClaims	23704	Ahead of the Facebook takedown, EUvsDisinfo exposed[57] these outlets as disseminating pro-Kremlin disinformation on multiple topics, including conspiracy theories about COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines and the global response[58].	0
NewsClaims	23705	According to Facebook, the coordinated inauthentic activity originated in Russia, the non-government controlled areas in Donbas region and Crimea.	0
NewsClaims	23706	“News Front” has previously been linked to the Russian security services (see: reporting by the DFR Lab[59] and Zeit[60]).	0
NewsClaims	23707	Poynter’s Coronavirus Facts Alliance accounts for over 5.000 COVID-19 related fact-checks since February 2020[61], which signifies a significant burden.	0
NewsClaims	23708	Facebook reported labelling about 50 million pieces of content related to COVID-19 on their platform alone with warnings, based on around 7,500 articles by their independent fact-checking partners[62].	0
NewsClaims	23709	Platforms are also still vulnerable to being the tool for viral distribution of false information and conspiracy theories.	0
NewsClaims	23710	In the beginning of May, for example, a pseudo-documentary[63] containing multiple cases of false, misleading and harmful claims spread with high velocity across the internet.	0
NewsClaims	23711	It was first uploaded to YouTube and amplified by conspiracy groups on Facebook[64], gaining millions of views within only a few days.	0
NewsClaims	23712	YouTube and Facebook have removed the “Plandemic” scene, saying that it spread inaccurate information about Covid-19 that could be harmful to the public.	0
NewsClaims	23713	However, the video continued to circulate, as people post new copies.	0
NewsClaims	23714	[65] This shows that further and continued efforts by the platforms are necessary beyond the Code of Practice[66] and as outlined in the previous edition of this report.	0
NewsClaims	23715	Independent research on social media platforms	0
NewsClaims	23716	Bellingcat[67] has discovered an ongoing information operation on Twitter and Facebook using a network of bots made up of newly created and stolen accounts.	0
NewsClaims	23717	The network is pushing topics supportive of the Chinese government and critical of either popular figures or protestors who are against it.	0
NewsClaims	23718	Bellingcat claims that the “content of the accounts correlates with findings made in the past, both by Twitter[68] and other entities[69], of state-linked information operations that are being run out of People’s Republic of China.”	0
NewsClaims	23719	The Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, that has previously researched the broad COVID-19 related censorship on Chinese social media platforms[70], has discovered that communications among international users of WeChat – the most popular social media platform in China and third in the world – are subject to surveillance that was previously thought to be exclusively reserved for China-based accounts[71].	0
NewsClaims	23720	Documents and images transmitted among non-China-registered accounts are monitored for content that is politically sensitive in China and then used to invisibly train WeChat’s Chinese online censorship system.	0
NewsClaims	23721	Earlier research had found that all users who have registered their WeChat accounts with a Chinese phone number are subject to Chinese online censorship regime wherever they are located in the world, even if they have later changed their account to a non-Chinese phone number[72].	0
NewsClaims	23722	This export of Chinese online censorship has raised questions about its role on politics in other countries[73].	0
NewsClaims	23723	The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) has reported a growing significance and impact of Chinese non-state actors on Western social media platforms.	0
NewsClaims	23724	Across March and April, “a loosely coordinated pro-China trolling campaign on Twitter harassed Western media outlets, impersonated Taiwanese users in an effort to undermine Taiwan’s position with the World Health Organization (WHO), spread false information about the COVID-19 outbreak, and joined in pre-existing inauthentic social media campaigns”.	0
NewsClaims	23725	[74]	0
NewsClaims	23726	Data from the Hamilton dashboard of GMF’s Alliance for Securing Democracy (ASD) shows that there has been a marked increase in the number of posts by Chinese officials on Twitter – from up to 4000 posts in December 2019 to 17.000 tweets in April since the COVID-19 crisis began in early 2020[75].	0
NewsClaims	23727	Twitter is blocked in China.	0
NewsClaims	23728	ASD also found that COVID-19 related messaging on Chinese state media, government and diplomatic Twitter accounts in the end of April and beginning of May were attacking the United States for its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, accused Washington of spreading conspiracy theories and framed China as a victim of “scapegoating” from the West.	0
NewsClaims	23729	Other messaging signalled China’s return to normalcy, while highlighting the negative effects the virus is having inside the United States.	0
NewsClaims	23730	[76]	0
NewsClaims	23731	Media freedom	0
NewsClaims	23732	Since mid-March 2020, media watchdogs have drawn attention to numerous cases in which governments have used the crisis to curtail media freedoms, including in the Eastern Partnership countries and Russia, Western Balkans, and the Southern Neighbourhood.	0
NewsClaims	23733	Across the entire Neighbourhood, media are facing restrictions on access to public information and censorship.	0
NewsClaims	23734	Journalists and bloggers are facing threats, harassment and physical violence.	0
NewsClaims	23735	Moreover, the economic downfall has caused additional financial challenge for the already cash-stripped media sector due to reduced revenues from advertising.	0
NewsClaims	23736	This puts the political or economic neutrality of the concerned media outlets at risk, and increases vulnerabilities to malign foreign influence.	0
NewsClaims	23737	Numerous institutions have called for greater respect of media freedoms and an emergency financial assistance to independent media in times of COVID-19[77], including Amnesty International[78], Reporters Without Borders[79] and International Federation of Journalists[80].	0
NewsClaims	23738	İfade Özgürlüğü Derneği[81] (Freedom of Expression Association, an organisation conducting research projects on internet censorship, academic freedom, press freedom and artistic expression) reported on 3 May on[82] that as of May 2020, 415,000 websites and 140,000 URL addresses have been blocked in Turkey, observing a “continued increase in internet censorship” since the outbreak of the pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	23739	42,000 tweets, 7,200 Twitter accounts, 12,450 YouTube videos and 6,500 Facebook posts have also been blocked.	0
NewsClaims	23740	A Novaya Gazeta article[83] on the COVID-19 situation in the region of Chechnya was removed following the order of the Russian government; the journalist Elena Milashina herself had faced physical attacks and threats.	0
NewsClaims	23741	Later, Russian authorities allowed Novaya Gazeta to publish a censored version of the article – a section of which was replaced by a black square.	0
NewsClaims	23742	The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused the New York Times and the Financial Times of making anti-Russia allegations by misrepresenting the statistics of new COVID-19 infections.	0
NewsClaims	23743	According to the ministry, the outlets made a “politically engaged attempt, to shift public attention from domestic troubles to yet another sensational anti-Russia fake news item”[84].	0
NewsClaims	23744	The ministry said[85] it would send letters to the editorial boards of the New York Times and the Financial Times over their reporting that Russia is undercounting and underreporting COVID-19 deaths, and ask them to publish refutations prepared by the Russian authorities.	0
NewsClaims	23745	The ministry would also contact the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media and UNESCO Director-General, and will notify the UN Secretariat.	0
NewsClaims	23746	According to reporting, this might even lead to a loss of accreditation for those media outlets in Russia, with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova saying that “[further] steps will depend on whether they publish retractions”.	0
NewsClaims	23747	[86]	0
NewsClaims	23748	Looking at China, there are media reports of strengthening suppression of information about China’s handling of the COVID-19 outbreak[87].	0
NewsClaims	23749	An increasingly strong enforcement of internet censorship goes beyond merely blocking or deleting unwanted information from online platforms and includes intimidation, detainment and other real world reprisals against internet users by security officials[88].	0
NewsClaims	23750	Concerning China’s domestic media, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has stated that “Beijing has used the crisis to further tighten its control of the media, banning the publication of any reports that question how it has been managed.	0
NewsClaims	23751	This has been made easier since state and privately-owned media organizations are all strictly controlled by the Communist Party”.	0
NewsClaims	23752	[89] China is ranked 177th out of 180 countries in RSF’s 2020 World Press Freedom index.	0
NewsClaims	23753	[90]	0
NewsClaims	23754	19 foreign journalists have been expelled or forced to leave China in the past 12 months[91], the majority of them during the COVID-19 pandemic[92].	0
NewsClaims	23755	In the case of three Wall Street Journal reporters, COVID-19 related coverage was invoked as the justification for the expulsion by the Chinese authorities[93].	0
NewsClaims	23756	Restrictions on foreign correspondents limit the availability of independent information that could be useful in understanding and assessing the measures taken in bringing the outbreak under control in the first country severely affected.	0
NewsClaims	23757	Expulsions of foreign journalists is, however, a long-term the issue that goes beyond the COVID-19 crisis.	0
NewsClaims	23758	The Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China (FCCC) annual survey for 2019[94] also found that “Chinese authorities increasingly use the threat of expulsion and visa denial to retaliate and warn against critical foreign coverage; summon journalists to meetings with officials; and harass Chinese citizens who work for the foreign press.”	0

NewsClaims	23859	Editor's Note: U.S. Masters Swimming has posted an updated version of this article.	0
NewsClaims	23860	Many pools and gyms are closing in an attempt to stop the spread of COVID-19, a virus that has upended daily life for millions of people around the globe.	0
NewsClaims	23861	With lots of conflicting advice and misinformation floating around in cyberspace, we reached out to an expert, Roberta Lavin, a professor of medicine at the University of Tennessee’s College of Nursing, for guidance on how you can safely navigate these uncharted waters.	0
NewsClaims	23862	(Here's some information on when you might be able to swim again and some resources for swimmers who are out of the water.)	0
NewsClaims	23863	Can COVID-19 be transmitted via water?	0
NewsClaims	23864	These droplets can speed undetected from person to person, causing an infection after the virus enters a person’s eyes, nose, or mouth.	0
NewsClaims	23865	Though this is the typical means of transmission, science is still sorting out the particulars of this new, or novel, coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	23866	“The question remains about all the modes of transmission, which we don’t know at this point.	0
NewsClaims	23867	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on March 10 that “the COVID-19 virus has not been detected in drinking water.	0
NewsClaims	23868	Conventional water treatment methods that use filtration and disinfection, such as those in most municipal drinking water systems, should remove or inactivate the virus that causes COVID-19.”	0
NewsClaims	23869	Does chlorine in pool water inactivate the virus?	0
NewsClaims	23870	Assuming that your pool is properly maintained, the disinfecting chemicals in the water should be enough to render the virus inactive.	0
NewsClaims	23871	If chlorine inactivates the virus, can I go swim?	0
NewsClaims	23872	“I think of all the things you could do, swimming is probably safer than most activities,” Lavin says.	0
NewsClaims	23873	But because most pools are housed inside a gym facility or other public space, that presents possibilities for infection before you ever reach the chlorinated water.	0
NewsClaims	23874	“You have to assume that people are infected,” Lavin says.	0
NewsClaims	23875	“Anything they touch would be contaminated.	0
NewsClaims	23876	It would be hard to get in and out of the pool without touching anything or interacting with another person.”	0
NewsClaims	23877	Think about it: How many surfaces do you touch on a normal visit to and from the pool?	0
NewsClaims	23878	You’re reaching for a door handle and using the card scanner or otherwise signing in.	0
NewsClaims	23879	You’re getting changed and putting your clothes in a locker or on a bench.	0
NewsClaims	23880	You’re touching a communal shower tap.	0
NewsClaims	23881	If you use the restroom, that’s a whole other series of doors and surfaces to navigate.	0
NewsClaims	23882	There’s plenty of places for a tiny, invisible virus to cling to and follow you home where it might infect you or a loved one.	0
NewsClaims	23883	Emerging research suggests that the coronavirus can survive on hard surfaces like plastic and steel for up to three days.	0
NewsClaims	23884	It may also hang in the air in tiny droplets called aerosols for up to a half an hour, at which time it can settle on surfaces.	0
NewsClaims	23885	If you’re planning to take part in an organized Masters workout, it's probably best that you don't.	0
NewsClaims	23886	When several swimmers get into a lane together to complete an interval workout, there’s the inevitable few moments at the wall (often while breathing heavily) in proximity to one another that can be a prime opportunity for viral transmission if one of you is carrying the virus.	0
NewsClaims	23887	And not everyone who has the virus shows signs of infection.	0
NewsClaims	23888	Theoretically, if you could go swim laps alone without touching any surfaces or coming into contact with another person, it might be safe to do so.	0
NewsClaims	23889	“If swimmers were in a large Olympic-style pool swimming laps and there was one swimmer in every other lane, then they are probably 6 feet apart,” Lavin says.	0
NewsClaims	23890	But when was the last time you had that sort of arrangement at your local Masters practice?	0
NewsClaims	23891	“And there’s another problem.	0
NewsClaims	23892	Part of our nature is to say, ‘Oh, no.	0
NewsClaims	23893	I’m not getting sick,’ and you deny that it could be a possibility.	0
NewsClaims	23894	And you go out and push through,” Lavin says.	0
NewsClaims	23895	“I think that’s one of the big problems for a lot of people, especially athletes.	0
NewsClaims	23896	You deny that it could possibly be an injury or that you could possibly be sick and you’re going to soldier on through it.	0
NewsClaims	23897	This is not the time to do that.”	0
NewsClaims	23898	Is swimming in open water a better option?	0
NewsClaims	23899	It’s often been said that the solution to pollution is dilution, and that may be true here, too, Lavin says.	0
NewsClaims	23900	“Because of the flow of the water and the amount of dilution in a larger body of water such as a lake or river, the virus would not be a concern.	0
NewsClaims	23901	The bigger concern there is that you shouldn’t be swimming in a lake or river by yourself.	0
NewsClaims	23902	And, of course, with social distancing, the goal is to keep people 6 or more feet away from each other.”	0
NewsClaims	23903	Also, across much of the United States, open water venues are only beginning to thaw or are still very cold, which presents the potential for hypothermia if you’re swimming for too long.	0
NewsClaims	23904	Proceed with caution or find alternative means of working out at home.	0
NewsClaims	23905	U.S. Masters Swimming has canceled Spring Nationals and is recommending LMSCs and clubs not to have events until at least May 10.	0
NewsClaims	23906	Is that a good idea?	0
NewsClaims	23907	“It’s an excellent idea,” Lavin says.	0
NewsClaims	23908	“We should have been [canceling large gatherings] sooner probably.” The reason is because of this particular virus’s highly contagious nature.	0
NewsClaims	23909	“We are now fairly certain people are contagious before they ever have symptoms, so they are spreading that virus all over the place before they have any symptoms.	0
NewsClaims	23910	All it takes is a couple of people in an environment in close contact like that” to widen the pandemic, Lavin says.	0
NewsClaims	23911	“The average person is spreading the virus to 2.5 more people.	0
NewsClaims	23912	If you put people in an environment like a large gathering and then everyone goes home, they take the virus back home with them and infect others in their community.”	0
NewsClaims	23913	This creates an ongoing cycle of transmission and infection that becomes very difficult to manage.	0
NewsClaims	23914	The CDC has also recommended a cancelation or postponement of all events with 50 or more people, and President Donald Trump went a step further and recommended avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people.	0
NewsClaims	23915	Many Masters meets and open water swims, as well as workouts, easily surpass those totals.	0
NewsClaims	23916	What does it mean to ‘flatten the curve?’	0
NewsClaims	23917	“You keep hearing people talk about ‘flattening the curve,’” Lavin says, referring to a means of reducing the catastrophic potential of COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	23918	“Part of the purpose of that is to reduce cases a bit, but it’s also to slow the spread so that hospitals will be able to handle patients.	0
NewsClaims	23919	If we keep the spread down below the number of hospital beds and ICU beds, we can provide excellent treatment and more people will live.	0
NewsClaims	23920	If it gets above the number of available hospital beds and ICU beds and doctors and nurses, then we provide poor treatment.”	0
NewsClaims	23921	In addition, the strain on frontline caregivers is significant and grows with each additional transmission.	0
NewsClaims	23922	“Healthcare workers are at greater risk” of infection themselves when they are overwhelmed with patients, Lavin says.	0
NewsClaims	23923	“When they’re tired, they can’t keep up” with safety protocols, such as changing masks and gowns as frequently as they should.	0
NewsClaims	23924	“When people get tired, they make mistakes.”	0
NewsClaims	23925	And if a whole rush of people become ill all at once, that also leads to some difficult decisions for health care workers about who should receive lifesaving care and who might have to go without in times of limited resources.	0
NewsClaims	23926	“Right now, we don’t have enough people or protective gear” to respond adequately to a mass-infection situation, she says.	0
NewsClaims	23927	Therefore, it’s critical that we flatten the curve by following CDC guidelines and reducing person-to-person contact.	0
NewsClaims	23928	These guidelines state:	0
NewsClaims	23929	Wash with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds each time.	0
NewsClaims	23930	Avoid touching your face, particularly your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.	0
NewsClaims	23931	Avoid close contact with people who are sick or who may have been exposed to the virus.	0
NewsClaims	23932	Stay at least 6 feet away from others.	0
NewsClaims	23933	These recommendations are particularly important for those who are at higher risk of infection, including older adults and those with a chronic medical condition such as heart disease, diabetes, and lung disease.	0
NewsClaims	23934	Stay home if you’re sick.	0
NewsClaims	23935	If you develop symptoms or think you may have been exposed to the virus, call your healthcare provider for advice.	0
NewsClaims	23936	Do not go directly to the office or the emergency room.	0
NewsClaims	23937	Call first and ask for guidance.	0
NewsClaims	23938	Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue (or cough or sneeze into your elbow or upper arm).	0
NewsClaims	23939	Throw used tissues in the trash and immediately wash your hands thoroughly.	0
NewsClaims	23940	If you are sick and must go out in public, wear a face mask.	0
NewsClaims	23941	If you are not sick, skip the face mask so that more supplies will be available to healthcare workers and others who truly need these devices.	0
NewsClaims	23942	(Editor's Note, May 9: This guidance from the CDC has changed since this article was originally published on March 19.	0
NewsClaims	23943	The CDC now recommends that everyone wear a cloth face covering when going out in public to reduce the risk of asymptomatic transmission of the virus.)	0
NewsClaims	23944	Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily.	0
NewsClaims	23945	This includes doorknobs, tables, countertops, handles, light switches, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, sinks, and any other high-traffic surfaces.	0
NewsClaims	23946	Rubbing alcohol, diluted bleach, and hydrogen peroxide can all disinfect surfaces.	0
NewsClaims	23947	Is there anything else you want Masters swimmers to know to keep themselves safe?	0
NewsClaims	23948	“I would say that to the extent that you’re in an area where you can swim outside, do so in small groups while keeping more than 6 feet between each other,” Lavin says.	0
NewsClaims	23949	“I think that is probably at this point a safe thing to do.	0
NewsClaims	23950	But swimming in the pool, the problem is you’re going to have to go into the gym and touch doors and benches and change clothes.	0
NewsClaims	23951	It’s probably just better not to.”	0
NewsClaims	23952	But you don’t have to become a couch potato either.	0
NewsClaims	23953	In fact, in these stressful and uncertain times, it’s more important than ever to get regular physical exercise.	0
NewsClaims	23954	Recommit to your at-home dryland training routine using free weights, resistance bands, or whatever materials you have at home.	0
NewsClaims	23955	And if you’re permitted to, take advantage of getting out into fresh air.	0
NewsClaims	23956	“It’s spring.	0
NewsClaims	23957	It’s beautiful out.	0
NewsClaims	23958	It’s a great time to go for a walk,” Lavin says.	0
NewsClaims	23959	False claims and misinformation about coronavirus cures have circulated on social media as people search for hope and good news during the pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	23960	One viral claim about alkaline diets – eliminating foods that are high in acidity to change the body's pH levels – has been shared on various occasions, and has also been debunked multiple times.	0
NewsClaims	23961	The pH of the coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	23962	The post cited research from the Journal of Virology from the American Society for Microbiology.	0
NewsClaims	23963	Though an article about a coronavirus and pH was published in the journal in April 1991, the abstract makes it clear that the study was about a different coronavirus, the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus type 4, or MHV4.	0
NewsClaims	23964	The journal doesn't claim that the MHV4 virus has a specific pH level or range.	0
NewsClaims	23965	Rather, the study looks at what happens when mice or rat cells are infected with MHV4 at pH levels ranging from 5.5 to 8.5.	0
NewsClaims	23966	That is incorrect.	0
NewsClaims	23967	The study cited in the post is unrelated to the new coronavirus, because COVID-19 was unknown until the current outbreak.	0
NewsClaims	23968	The body regulates pH levels, meaning that diets don't change the pH levels of blood cells or tissues.	0
NewsClaims	23969	"An analysis by the MD Anderson Center about the relationship between alkaline diets and pH levels explained that a dietary change may result in a pH shift in saliva or urine, because these are waste products, but ""there’s no way you could ever eat enough that it really impacts your blood."""	0
NewsClaims	23970	Alkaline foods and the coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	23971	Eating more alkaline foods is not a proven preventive measure or cure for the coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	23972	Though a healthy diet can help strengthen an immune system, there is no proof that an alkaline diet specifically is beneficial.	0
NewsClaims	23973	The Facebook post incorrectly states the pH levels of some of the listed foods.	0
NewsClaims	23974	The post listed lemons with a pH of 9.9 and limes with a pH of 8.2, when they both have a pH level of 2 to 3.	0
NewsClaims	23975	"Donald Schaffner, a food science specialist, told The Associate Press, ""These pH values for these foods are completely wrong,"" and people can eat these foods if they want, but the best way to prevent getting sick is to stay away from other people."	0
NewsClaims	23976	Our rating: False	0
NewsClaims	23977	The claim that an alkaline diet will help beat the coronavirus is FALSE.	0
NewsClaims	23978	The claim that coronavirus has a pH level of 5.5 to 8.5 cited a study from 1991 about a different coronavirus, not the one that causes COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	23979	The post misinterpreted the findings of that study.	0

NewsClaims	23985	SPRINGFIELD, Mass.	0
NewsClaims	23986	(WWLP) – The COVID-19 outbreak is a global pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	23987	And with that, comes a lot of false information on the internet.	0
NewsClaims	23988	22News has been vigilant in separating fact from fiction when it comes to coronavirus, both nationally and locally.	0
NewsClaims	23989	There are many myths about COVID-19 that have been circulating through social media — here are some of the most common ones, from the World Health Organization.	0
NewsClaims	23990	"The WHO says there is ""no reason to believe cold weather can kill the new coronavirus,"" or other diseases, for that matter."	0
NewsClaims	23991	Myth #2: COVID-19 cannot be transmitted in hotter, more humid climates	0
NewsClaims	23992	Truth: Protective measures, like proper handwashing and social distancing, need to be taken no matter where you live.	0
NewsClaims	23993	Myth #3: Taking a hot bath prevents you from getting COVID-19	0
NewsClaims	23994	Just like the cold weather and hot and humid climate myths, this is not true.	0
NewsClaims	23995	Your body temperature stays relatively stable even when you take an extremely hot bath.	0
NewsClaims	23996	This just leaves you with a risk of a burn.	0
NewsClaims	23997	This prevents viruses on your hands from infecting you when you touch your face.	0
NewsClaims	23998	Truth: As temperatures continue to warm as we dive into spring, mosquitoes will become more common again in Western Massachusetts.	0
NewsClaims	23999	That typically brings a risk of Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) and West Nile Virus, but the increasing population of mosquitoes does not create another channel in which you can get COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	24000	This is because the new coronavirus is spread primarily through droplets when someone with the coronavirus sneezes or coughs.	0
NewsClaims	24001	Myth #5: Hand dryers are effective in killing the new coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	24002	Truth: The heat from a hand dryer alone is not enough to kill the new coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	24003	However, in combination with washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, this method is very effective.	0
NewsClaims	24004	You can also dry your hands after using paper towels, or instead use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.	0
NewsClaims	24005	Myth #6: UV lamps kill the new coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	24006	It should especially not be used on hands or your body as it can cause irritation.	0
NewsClaims	24007	UV light has been known to kill the flu virus, however.	0
NewsClaims	24008	Myth #7: Thermal scanners can detect everyone who is infected with coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	24009	Truth: Thermal scanners, like thermometers, can detect people who have a higher-than-normal body temperature due to infection from COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	24010	But not everyone who is infected with the coronavirus has a fever yet.	0
NewsClaims	24011	"According to the WHO, ""it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever."""	0
NewsClaims	24012	(WHO)	0
NewsClaims	24013	Spraying alcohol and chlorine all over your body can be harmful if it gets into your eyes or mouth.	0
NewsClaims	24014	The World Health Organization says they both can be used to disinfect surfaces, however.	0
NewsClaims	24015	Myth #9: Getting a pneumonia vaccine protects against COVID-19	0
NewsClaims	24016	Truth: The World Health Organization says there is some evidence that regularly rinsing your nose with saline can help you get over the common cold more quickly.	0
NewsClaims	24017	But this does not apply to COVID-19, and other respiratory infections.	0
NewsClaims	24018	The same applies to gargling a saline solution.	0
NewsClaims	24019	Truth: There is no scientific evidence that eating garlic prevents you from being infected with the novel coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	24020	However, according to the National Institutes of Health, it does have some antimicrobial properties.	0
NewsClaims	24021	Myth #12: The coronavirus only affects older people, and not younger people	0
NewsClaims	24022	However, people who are older are more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the new coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	24023	People with preexisting conditions are also at an increased risk for more severe complications, such as people with heart disease, diabetes, and lung disease.	0
NewsClaims	24024	Truth: The World Health Organization is helping with research and development efforts to find treatments for coronavirus, however, they are still under investigation, and must be tested through clinical trials.	0
NewsClaims	24025	Right now, there is no medication recommended to prevent or treat COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	24026	New coronavirus threat galvanizes scientists	0
NewsClaims	24027	Barely 1 month after Chinese health authorities reported the first cases of a mysterious new pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, the world may be on the cusp of a new pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	24028	As	0
NewsClaims	24029	Science	0
NewsClaims	24030	went to press, the number of confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, dubbed 2019-nCoV, had shot up to more than 4500, most of them in mainland China but more than 80 in 17 other countries and territories.	0
NewsClaims	24031	China has quarantined 35 million people in Wuhan and several other cities in a desperate attempt to slow the spread of the virus.	0
NewsClaims	24032	But as the case numbers keep soaring, the realization has set in that it may be too late to have much impact.	0
NewsClaims	24033	Even seasoned epidemiologists are astonished at the virus's dizzying spread.	0
NewsClaims	24034	Early estimates of the number of infected people—thought to far exceed the number of confirmed cases—became obsolete overnight.	0
NewsClaims	24035	"""Our original results are NO LONGER VALID,"" University of Hong Kong epidemiologist Gabriel Leung tweeted on 22 January, 1 day after his group had posted its first mathematical model of the epidemic."	0
NewsClaims	24036	Leung is now estimating that Wuhan alone had 43,590 infections by 25 January—and that the number is doubling every 6 days.	0
NewsClaims	24037	"""How widespread does this go?"""	0
NewsClaims	24038	asks Marion Koopmans, a virologist at Erasmus Medical Center.	0
NewsClaims	24039	"""This deserves our full attention."""	0

NewsClaims	24044	So far 2019-nCoV appears to be milder than its cousin, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which had a mortality rate of 10%.	0
NewsClaims	24045	Only 106 deaths have been recorded to date.	0
NewsClaims	24046	But hundreds more people are seriously ill, and their fate is unclear.	0
NewsClaims	24047	And countless other questions remain.	0
NewsClaims	24048	If asymptomatic people frequently infect others, it could vastly complicate efforts to contain 2019-nCoV.	0
NewsClaims	24049	The virus's explosive spread has been met by an unprecedented rush by scientists to uncover its origins, find treatments, and develop vaccines that could save millions of lives if the world really does face a pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	24050	Here are some of the ways researchers are attempting to better understand 2019-nCoV and reduce its harm.	0
NewsClaims	24051	Where Did the Virus Come From?	0
NewsClaims	24052	Genetic analyses are starting to yield some clues.	0
NewsClaims	24053	Chinese researchers first shared a genomic sequence of 2019-nCoV on 11 January.	0
NewsClaims	24054	"Labs in China and abroad have since announced nearly three dozen additional sequences of the virus—""a stellar job,"" Koopmans says."	0
NewsClaims	24055	A team led by Shi Zheng-Li of the Wuhan Institute of Virology reported on 23 January that 2019-nCoV's sequence was 96.2% identical to that of a bat coronavirus and 79.5% identical to the SARS coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	24056	SARS, for example, probably moved from bats to civets—sold as a delicacy in many markets—to humans.	0
NewsClaims	24057	On 27 January, Xinhua reported that researchers have found evidence of the new coronavirus in 33 of 585 environmental samples taken at the market on 1 January—the day it was closed—and on 12 January.	0
NewsClaims	24058	They all came from the western end, which had a concentration of booths selling wildlife.	0
NewsClaims	24059	The first known patient became ill on 1 December 2019 and had no links to the market, according to a paper published by Chinese researchers in	0
NewsClaims	24060	The Lancet	0
NewsClaims	24061	on 24 January that offered details about the first 41 patients in Wuhan.	0
NewsClaims	24062	In that group, 12 others also had no links to the market.	0
NewsClaims	24063	An analysis of the first 30 publicly posted sequences shows they differ from each other by no more than seven nucleotides (see graphic, right).	0
NewsClaims	24064	Using these differences and presumed mutation rates, several groups have calculated that the virus began to spread around mid-November 2019—which supports the thesis that spread may have occurred before any of the cases linked to the market.	0
NewsClaims	24065	One group put the origin of the outbreak as early as 18 September 2019.	0
NewsClaims	24066	Bin Cao, a pulmonary specialist at Capital Medical University in Beijing and the corresponding author of	0
NewsClaims	24067	The Lancet	0
NewsClaims	24068	article, agrees the story is more complicated than many thought.	0
NewsClaims	24069	Science.	0
NewsClaims	24070	Could Existing Drugs Work?	0
NewsClaims	24071	It may take years to develop treatments specifically designed for 2019-nCoV, but researchers hope existing drugs can help.	0
NewsClaims	24072	Wuhan's Jin Yintan Hospital has already launched a randomized, controlled trial of the anti-HIV drug combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, according to the report in	0
NewsClaims	24073	The Lancet.	0
NewsClaims	24074	"There's a precedent from the SARS outbreak: In a nonrandomized trial published in 2004, researchers saw an ""apparent improved outcome"" from the same two protease inhibitors, combined with a third drug, ribavirin, in SARS patients."	0
NewsClaims	24075	Saudi Arabia is now conducting a trial with the same protease inhibitors, combined with interferon beta-1b, against Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), a coronavirus distantly related to SARS and 2019-nCoV that is occasionally spread by camels.	0
NewsClaims	24076	But in a recent mouse study by Ralph Baric of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, this cocktail had lackluster results against MERS.	0
NewsClaims	24077	Remdesivir combined with interferon slowed viral replication in MERS-infected mice, and their lung function improved.	0
NewsClaims	24078	U.S. biotech Regeneron is trying to identify monoclonal antibodies effective against 2019-nCoV, as it did previously for MERS and Ebola.	0
NewsClaims	24079	"""The idea of using those in combination would have profoundly good prospects."""	0
NewsClaims	24080	Can Vaccines be Developed in Time?	0
NewsClaims	24081	In the stock pandemic movie, scientists develop a vaccine just in time to save the world.	0
NewsClaims	24082	In real life, new vaccines have never been developed fast enough to have a significant impact on an emerging virus.	0
NewsClaims	24083	But in the case of 2019-nCoV, scientists are trying to work at Hollywood speed.	0
NewsClaims	24084	The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a nonprofit formed in 2016 to fund and shepherd the development of new vaccines against emerging infectious diseases, has already given two companies and an academic group a total of $12.5 million to develop 2019-nCoV vaccines.	0
NewsClaims	24085	The efforts began hours after Chinese researchers first published a viral sequence 3 weeks ago.	0
NewsClaims	24086	One is a collaboration between the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and U.S. biotech Moderna, which makes vaccines by converting viral sequences into messenger RNA (mRNA).	0
NewsClaims	24087	(When injected into the body, mRNA causes the body to produce a viral protein, which triggers immune responses.)	0
NewsClaims	24088	Moderna and NIAID have worked on a vaccine against MERS that consists of mRNA coding for a protein on the viral surface called the spike; in theory, all the team needs to do now is swap in the genetic sequence for 2019-nCoV's spike.	0
NewsClaims	24089	CEPI funded a second company, Inovio, to produce vaccines that work in a similar way but are made of DNA.	0
NewsClaims	24090	It, too, has a template for a 2019-nCoV vaccine: another candidate MERS vaccine that relies on the spike protein.	0
NewsClaims	24091	CEPI's third grant went to researchers at the University of Queensland who are developing a vaccine made of viral proteins produced in cell cultures.	0
NewsClaims	24092	Vaccine projects are also underway in mainland China, Hong Kong, Belgium, and Germany.	0
NewsClaims	24093	Once candidate vaccines are available, researchers will test them in animals, then seek approval for phase I human trials.	0
NewsClaims	24094	"""We're building the airplane as we're flying,"" says Inovio CEO Joseph Kim."	0
NewsClaims	24095	NIAID Director Anthony Fauci says the first clinical trial of the Moderna vaccine could start within 3 months.	0
NewsClaims	24096	In the best-case scenario, Barney Graham, who leads the project for NIAID, says the Moderna vaccine could be ready for larger, real-world efficacy tests in humans by summer.	0
NewsClaims	24097	Even if it works, mass-producing it or any other vaccine quickly would present a huge challenge.	0
NewsClaims	24098	With luck, however, the outbreak will fade by summer, and with it the urgency of having a vaccine at the ready.	0
NewsClaims	24099	"""Nobody knows what's going to happen,"" says Stéphane Bancel, Moderna's CEO."	0
NewsClaims	24100	"""We're all hoping we'll never need this vaccine."""	0
NewsClaims	24101	-- Authorization Enables Broader Use of Remdesivir to Treat Hospitalized Patients with Severe COVID-19 Disease in the United States --	0
NewsClaims	24102	-- Based on Patients’ Severity of Disease, Authorization Allows 5-day and 10-day Treatment Durations --	0
NewsClaims	24103	FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for the investigational antiviral remdesivir to treat COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	24104	The EUA will facilitate broader use of remdesivir to treat hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to remdesivir at additional hospitals across the country.	0
NewsClaims	24105	Allocation of the currently limited available supply of remdesivir will be made based on guiding principles that aim to maximize access for appropriate patients in urgent need of treatment, with direction from and in collaboration with the government.	0
NewsClaims	24106	Remdesivir is authorized for the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 disease.	0
NewsClaims	24107	The optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.	0
NewsClaims	24108	Under the EUA, both 5-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease.	0
NewsClaims	24109	The authorization is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process.	0
NewsClaims	24110	The EUA allows for the distribution and emergency use of remdesivir only for the treatment of COVID-19; remdesivir remains an investigational drug and has not been approved by FDA.	0
NewsClaims	24111	The U.S. government will coordinate the donation and distribution of remdesivir to hospitals in cities most heavily impacted by COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	24112	Given the severity of illness of patients appropriate for remdesivir treatment and the limited availability of drug supply, hospitals with intensive care units and other hospitals that the government deems most in need will receive priority in the distribution of remdesivir.	0
NewsClaims	24113	Gilead is working with the U.S. government on the logistics of remdesivir distribution and will provide more information when the company begins shipping the drug under the EUA.	0
NewsClaims	24114	“We will continue to work with partners across the globe to increase our supply of remdesivir while advancing our ongoing clinical trials to supplement our understanding of the drug’s profile.	0
NewsClaims	24115	We are working to meet the needs of patients, their families and healthcare workers around the world with the greatest sense of urgency and responsibility.”	0
NewsClaims	24116	The EUA is based on available data from two global clinical trials – the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in patients with moderate to severe symptoms of COVID-19, including those who were critically ill, and Gilead’s global Phase 3 study evaluating 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir in patients with severe disease.	0
NewsClaims	24117	Multiple additional clinical trials are ongoing to generate more data on the safety and efficacy of remdesivir as a treatment for COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	24118	Remdesivir must be administered intravenously.	0
NewsClaims	24119	The optimal dosing and duration of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 is still unknown.	0
NewsClaims	24120	Under this EUA, the 10-day dosing duration is suggested for patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and the 5-day dosing duration is suggested for patients not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and/or ECMO.	0
NewsClaims	24121	If a patient on the 5-day dosing duration does not demonstrate clinical improvement after five days, treatment may be extended for up to five additional days (10 days total).	0
NewsClaims	24122	As previously announced, Gilead has donated the entirety of its existing supply of finished and unfinished product to help address the urgent medical needs posed by this pandemic around the world.	0
NewsClaims	24123	Assuming a 10-day treatment course, Gilead’s donation of 1.5 million individual doses of remdesivir equates to more than 140,000 treatment courses that will be provided at no cost to treat patients following potential emergency authorizations and regulatory approvals, including this EUA.	0
NewsClaims	24124	Gilead will continue to support clinical trials, and expanded access and compassionate use programs for remdesivir.	0
NewsClaims	24125	In addition, Gilead will evaluate global allocation of supply on an ongoing basis using multiple, independent data sources to track the incidence and severity of the outbreak.	0
NewsClaims	24126	An EUA is intended to provide availability of a medicine during an emergency; an EUA is not the equivalent of an FDA approval.	0

NewsClaims	24128	Scale-Up of Remdesivir Supply	0
NewsClaims	24129	Gilead has aggressively implemented a multipronged approach to scale up production and rapidly build supply of the investigational antiviral remdesivir.	0
NewsClaims	24130	The company has invested significant capital, at risk, to meet the supply needs for clinical trials and emergency treatment programs, and to prepare for even greater demand following regulatory authorizations, should these occur.	0
NewsClaims	24131	Through process refinements, Gilead has substantially shortened the manufacturing lead time from raw materials through to finished product.	0
NewsClaims	24132	Gilead has also supplemented internal manufacturing with significant additional capacity from multiple partners in North America, Europe and Asia.	0
NewsClaims	24133	The company has set a goal of producing at least 500,000 treatment courses by October, 1 million treatment courses by December 2020 and millions more in 2021, if required.	0
NewsClaims	24134	These goals were based on a 10-day treatment course.	0
NewsClaims	24135	Gilead now anticipates being able to cover significantly more patients based on the SIMPLE study results, which demonstrated similar efficacy with 5-day and 10-day dosing durations in patients with severe disease.	0
NewsClaims	24136	Looking ahead, Gilead is building a geographically diverse consortium of leading pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturing companies to help reach and exceed manufacturing goals, and go above and beyond what any company could do individually.	0
NewsClaims	24137	More details about these efforts are available here.	0

NewsClaims	24185	"It recommended several fruits and vegetables supposedly ""more alkaline"" or ""above the pH level"" of SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the disease."	0
NewsClaims	24186	The information is inaccurate.	0
NewsClaims	24187	"""Viruses themselves do not have pH levels, because they are not water-based solutions,"" a group of health experts convened by international nonprofit organization Meedan stated in their COVID-19 Expert Database website."	0
NewsClaims	24188	According to Oxford University’s	0
NewsClaims	24189	Lexico,	0
NewsClaims	24190	"a solution is considered water-based if its ""medium or main ingredient"" is water."	0
NewsClaims	24191	The pH scale is used to determine if a water-based solution is acidic (pH level of below 7), neutral (pH level of 7), or basic, oftentimes called alkaline (pH level of above 7).	0
NewsClaims	24192	Eating more alkaline food does not affect blood pH but may affect a person’s saliva and urine pH levels, said Meedan’s team of experts.	0
NewsClaims	24193	"However, ""these changes are variable from person to person and will not prevent or cure COVID-19."""	0
NewsClaims	24194	Maria Carmela Taob, a faculty member of the Department of Food Science and Nutrition (DFSN) of the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman, shared a similar sentiment.	0
NewsClaims	24195	Taob explained that a food’s designation -- whether acidic, neutral, or alkaline -- is based on the ash it leaves behind after being combusted under laboratory conditions.	0
NewsClaims	24196	"Meat, fish, poultry, eggs, cheese, and grains produce ""acid-ash,"" while most fruits and vegetables except for prunes, plums, and cranberries generate ""alkaline-ash."""	0
NewsClaims	24197	Coffee, tea, certain sweets, fats, and starches are considered neutral.	0
NewsClaims	24198	The flier, which listed seven fruits, garlic, dandelion, and turmeric tea, assigned wrong pH level to each food, ranging from 7.4 to 22.7.	0
NewsClaims	24199	"In an April 5 FB post, Benelyn Dumelod, an associate professor from UP DFSN, disputed this, saying the maximum pH value of any ""food or nonfood, living or nonliving"" is 14."	0
NewsClaims	24200	Below is a comparison of the foods’ pH values as declared in the flier, against their correct pH values according to several sources including Dumelod.	0
NewsClaims	24201	None were alkaline, or had a pH level between 7.1 and 14.	0
NewsClaims	24202	Both Taob and the experts at Meedan pointed out that a well-balanced diet -- including the consumption of a variety of fruits and vegetables -- can help support one’s immune system.	0
NewsClaims	24203	As far as the World Health Organization (WHO) is concerned, there is still no drug or vaccine proven to cure or prevent one from acquiring COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	24204	Clinical trials, however, are currently being performed in several parts of the world.	0
NewsClaims	24205	"The viral flier, which bore the title ""Goodbye Corona Virus!"	0
NewsClaims	24206	"The symptoms listed in the flier indicating ""if a person has COVID-19"" are also misleading."	0
NewsClaims	24207	"While dry cough and fever are listed by WHO as common symptoms of the disease, sore throat and the loss of the sense of smell and taste are ""less common"" and may affect some patients only."	0
NewsClaims	24208	"Shortness of breath, on the other hand, is developed by ""seriously-ill"" individuals, which is just around one of every five COVID-19 patients, added the WHO’s list of symptoms."	0
NewsClaims	24209	The earliest retrievable online copy of the flier carrying the false claims was uploaded last April 16 on Twitter.	0
NewsClaims	24210	It got over 41,000 retweets and 53,700 likes, and has received comments from netizens pointing out the disinformation.	0
NewsClaims	24211	However, posts bearing the claims about alkalizing foods have been circulating since March in both FB and private messaging application WhatsApp, as shown by fact check articles of Africa Check, the Associated Press, and the Agence France-Presse.	0
NewsClaims	24212	They appear to have twisted the contents of a 1991 study published in the Journal of Virology that looked into coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus type 4 (MHV4), and not the SARS-CoV-2.	0
NewsClaims	24213	The false flier was published as original content by at least five netizens on FB from June 17 to 22, and continues to be shared this July.	0
NewsClaims	24214	The posts surfaced a day before the total recorded COVID-19 cases worldwide surpassed the eight million mark, and the same day the Philippines’ own number of cases reached over 27,000.	0

NewsClaims	24223	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by the most recent strain of virus from the coronavirus family to infect humans.	0
NewsClaims	24224	This family of viruses also includes Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).	0
NewsClaims	24225	They are called novel coronaviruses because it’s the first time these specific viruses have jumped from animals to humans.	0
NewsClaims	24226	Coronavirus myths, debunked	0
NewsClaims	24227	Rumors have spread rapidly about many aspects of the virus.	0
NewsClaims	24228	Here’s the truth about these coronavirus myths about where the virus originated, who is at risk, how it’s transmitted, and contamination concerns.	0
NewsClaims	24229	Local health officials in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China reported several cases of pneumonia among a group of people linked to a wholesale market in Wuhan in December 2019.	0
NewsClaims	24230	That was the start of COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	24231	MYTH: Coronavirus only affects older people	0
NewsClaims	24232	While older people may be more at risk of infection because their immune systems may not be as strong as those of younger adults, they’re far from the only group of people at risk, explains Dr.	0
NewsClaims	24233	Patrick J. Kenney, DO, FACOI, who is double-board certified in Internal Medicine and Infectious Disease.	0
NewsClaims	24234	Several groups of people have an increased risk of infection, including those who are immunosuppressed.	0
NewsClaims	24235	MYTH: Recreational drugs cure coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	24236	"Facebook posts have claimed that weed is a cure for coronavirus (False: Cannabis ""Kills Coronavirus,"" 2020)."	0
NewsClaims	24237	Rumors have said the same about cocaine.	0
NewsClaims	24238	One medication, an antiviral drug called Remdesivir, has been shown in certain studies to improve symptoms and shorten hospital stays.	0
NewsClaims	24239	There are also two vaccines that have received emergency use authorization from the FDA – one made by Pfizer and one made by Moderna.	0
NewsClaims	24240	Roll outs have begun nationwide but it may be some time before you can get the vaccine yourself.	0
NewsClaims	24241	MYTH: Spraying chlorine/rubbing alcohol on your body can cure coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	24242	Rubbing or spraying cleaning products—whether that’s chlorine or rubbing alcohol—will not kill viruses already inside your body.	0
NewsClaims	24243	Even worse, doing so may be harmful to your health.	0
NewsClaims	24244	Chlorine may be used to clean surfaces in your home but should be kept away from your body (WHO, n.d.).	0
NewsClaims	24245	MYTH: Inhaling bleach fumes cures coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	24246	This is similar to the previous myth.	0
NewsClaims	24247	Inhaling bleach fumes is dangerous and will not kill viruses that are already inside you.	0
NewsClaims	24248	Bleach may also be used to clean surfaces in your home but should be kept away from the body (WHO, n.d.).	0
NewsClaims	24249	Ingesting or inhaling chemicals can be deadly.	0
NewsClaims	24250	MYTH: Ultraviolet light can kill coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	24251	Exposing parts of your body to ultraviolet (UV) light can be dangerous.	0
NewsClaims	24252	The UV radiation may cause skin irritation, so you should not use UV sterilization lamps on your hands or other parts of your skin (WHO, n.d.).	0
NewsClaims	24253	MYTH: Air dryers can kill coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	24254	It currently isn’t known exactly how temperature affects the virus.	0
NewsClaims	24255	People have wondered the same thing about warm weather as they have about air dryers.	0
NewsClaims	24256	Although some similar viruses such as the common cold spread easier during colder months, the CDC notes that this doesn’t mean you cannot be infected by them during warmer months (2019-nCoV Frequently Asked Questions and Answers, 2020).	0
NewsClaims	24257	The World Health Organization (WHO) says air dryers are not effective at killing the virus, and they advise that you still wash your hands using proper hand hygiene before drying them with an air dryer or paper towels (WHO, n.d.).	0
NewsClaims	24258	A study published in the	0
NewsClaims	24259	New England Journal of Medicine	0
NewsClaims	24260	found that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be detected in aerosols for up to three hours, on copper for up to four hours, on cardboard for up to 24 hours, and on plastic and stainless steel for up to 72 hours (Doremalen, 2020).	0
NewsClaims	24261	However, we don’t know how a warmer temperature would affect that timeline.	0
NewsClaims	24262	But there are common household cleaners that can inactivate the virus, and washing your hands following proper protocol can decrease your risk of infection.	0
NewsClaims	24263	MYTH: Antibiotics are effective at treating coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	24264	"""Antibiotics do not treat viruses of any kind, including coronaviruses,"" Dr. Kenney states unequivocally."	0
NewsClaims	24265	Antibiotics target bacteria, not viruses.	0
NewsClaims	24266	COVID-19 is caused by a virus.	0
NewsClaims	24267	MYTH: Sesame oil and garlic can prevent transmission of coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	24268	While garlic has been shown to have some antimicrobial properties, neither garlic nor sesame oil will prevent the transmission of this virus.	0
NewsClaims	24269	MYTH: Regularly rinsing your nose with saline can prevent coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	24270	There is no evidence that rinsing your nose with saline can prevent coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	24271	But you can help reduce your risk of catching coronavirus by following proper hand hygiene before touching your mouth, nose, or eyes, all of which have mucosal linings where the virus may enter.	0
NewsClaims	24272	Surfaces in your home can also be cleaned with 70% ethanol (alcohol) cleanser, which can be purchased commercially, or bleach or sodium hypochlorite solutions, all of which inactivate the virus.	0
NewsClaims	24273	MYTH: Drinking liquids will wash the virus into your stomach where it will die	0
NewsClaims	24274	While it is always a good idea to stay hydrated, it is definitely still possible to become infected even if you are drinking fluids.	0
NewsClaims	24275	The fluids do not wash all of the virus particles into the stomach.	0
NewsClaims	24276	MYTH: You can diagnose yourself with COVID-19 by holding your breath	0
NewsClaims	24277	There is no evidence to suggest that being able to hold your breath is associated with whether or not you have COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	24278	If you think you might be sick, seek medical attention.	0
NewsClaims	24279	MYTH: It’s not safe to receive a package from China	0
NewsClaims	24280	It is, in fact, safe to accept packages that have been shipped from China.	0
NewsClaims	24281	"The CDC notes that there’s a low risk of infection from products that have been shipped from areas with outbreaks because of the virus’s ""low survivability on surfaces"" (2019-nCoV Frequently Asked Questions, 2020)."	0

NewsClaims	24284	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is warning consumers not to purchase or drink a product sold online as a medical treatment due to a recent rise in reported health issues.	0
NewsClaims	24285	Since 2010, the FDA has warned consumers about the dangers of Miracle or Master Mineral Solution, Miracle Mineral Supplement, MMS, Chlorine Dioxide (CD) Protocol, Water Purification Solution (WPS) and other similar products.	0
NewsClaims	24286	Miracle Mineral Solution has not been approved by the FDA for any use, but these products continue to be promoted on social media as a remedy for treating autism, cancer, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis and flu, among other conditions.	0
NewsClaims	24287	“The FDA’s drug approval process ensures that patients receive safe and effective drug products.	0
NewsClaims	24288	Miracle Mineral Solution and similar products are not FDA-approved, and ingesting these products is the same as drinking bleach.	0
NewsClaims	24289	Consumers should not use these products, and parents should not give these products to their children for any reason,” said FDA Acting Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D.	0
NewsClaims	24290	“The FDA will continue to track those selling this dangerous product and take appropriate enforcement actions against those who attempt to evade FDA regulations and market unapproved and potentially dangerous products to the American public.	0
NewsClaims	24291	Our top priority is to protect the public from products that place their health at risk, and we will send a strong and clear message that these products have the potential to cause serious harm.”	0
NewsClaims	24292	Websites selling MMS describe the product as a liquid that is 28% sodium chlorite in distilled water.	0
NewsClaims	24293	Product directions instruct consumers to mix the sodium chlorite solution with citric acid – such as lemon or lime juice – or another acid before drinking.	0
NewsClaims	24294	In many instances, the sodium chlorite is sold with a citric acid “activator.” When the acid is added, the mixture becomes chlorine dioxide, a powerful bleaching agent.	0
NewsClaims	24295	The FDA recently received new reports of people experiencing severe vomiting, severe diarrhea, life-threatening low blood pressure caused by dehydration and acute liver failure after drinking these products.	0
NewsClaims	24296	The FDA is not aware of any scientific evidence supporting the safety or effectiveness of MMS products, despite claims that the solution is an antimicrobial, antiviral and antibacterial.	0
NewsClaims	24297	The FDA encourages consumers to talk to a health care professional about treating medical conditions or diseases.	0
NewsClaims	24298	Consumers who have experienced an adverse health effect after ingesting this product should seek immediate medical attention.	0
NewsClaims	24299	Anyone who has experienced an adverse health effect that may be related to MMS should report it through the FDA’s MedWatch Safety Information program as soon as possible at 800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htm.	0
NewsClaims	24300	The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.	0

NewsClaims	24342	And even though there is a Journal of Virology and Antiviral Research, there appears to be no such study in there proving up alkaline diets in the fight against COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	24343	According to All India Radio on March 31, 2020:	0
NewsClaims	24344	The research report referred to in the Journal of Virology & Anti viral Research is related to a completely different coronavirus - Mouse Hepatitis Virus Type-4 or MHV-4 & not COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	24345	The report was published way back in 1991.	0
NewsClaims	24346	People are desperate for hope during the coronavirus outbreak, and online claims touting this diet are going viral.	0
NewsClaims	24347	But this is not an effective preventative measure in fighting off the virus responsible for more than 51,700 deaths globally.	0
NewsClaims	24348	In the U.S. alone, some 5,100 people have died.	0
NewsClaims	24349	The post, with more than 300 shares, had commenters claiming they were following the diet and others noting the advice was bogus.	0
NewsClaims	24350	In fact, there is no published, medical proof that this diet could keep someone from becoming ill with, or dying from, COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	24351	Africa Check, a fact-checking site, debunked the claim on March 25, 2020.	0
NewsClaims	24352	And Reuters addressed a similar claim on March 10, 2020, confirming with the World Health Organization that there are no treatments - no cure and no available vaccine - yet for COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	24353	"""There are no specific treatments for COVID-19 and treatment is based on clinical presentation."	0
NewsClaims	24354	"Most cases are mild and self-limiting, and treated symptomatically,"" a WHO spokesperson told Reuters."	0
NewsClaims	24355	The false claim may have originated in online theories that alkaline diets help prevent cancer.	0
NewsClaims	24356	Lead Stories has also debunked that claim.	0
NewsClaims	24357	In a story we published in 2019, medical experts denied the connection between a diet high in alkaline foods and a cure for cancer.	0
NewsClaims	24358	A good analysis on this medical myth is published by the MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas.	0
NewsClaims	24359	"Titled ""Alkaline diet: What cancer patients should know,"" it reads:"	0
NewsClaims	24360	The alkaline diet is based on the theory that eating certain foods can change the body's acid levels, also called the pH levels.	0
NewsClaims	24361	Some believe that changing the body's pH levels can improve your health and help you lose weight or even prevent cancer.	0
NewsClaims	24362	But there's no way the foods you eat can alter the pH level of your blood.	0

NewsClaims	24412	The claim that discussing a possible pandemic in 2015, over the struggle with Ebola, or supporting such discussions in 2019, when may reveal Bill Gates planned to create it himself, is not supported by any evidence.	0

NewsClaims	24424	is such method effective THANKS	0
NewsClaims	24425	It seems there could be potential - article extract below - , for equipment use at least.	0
NewsClaims	24426	Personally I'd research thoroughly to establish the effectivity and method and then risk assess to weigh up the cost/benefit against risks especially given the severity of UVC misuse.	0
NewsClaims	24427	There is also a third type: UVC.	0
NewsClaims	24428	This relatively obscure part of the spectrum consists of a shorter, more energetic wavelength of light.	0
NewsClaims	24429	It is particularly good at destroying genetic material – whether in humans or viral particles.	0
NewsClaims	24430	Luckily, most of us are unlikely to have ever encountered any.	0
NewsClaims	24431	That’s because it’s filtered out by ozone in the atmosphere long before it reaches our fragile skin.	0
NewsClaims	24432	Or that was the case, at least, until scientists discovered that they could harness UVC to kill microorganisms.	0
NewsClaims	24433	Since the finding in 1878, artificially produced UVC has become a staple method of sterilisation – one used in hospitals, airplanes, offices, and factories every day.	0
NewsClaims	24434	Crucially, it’s also fundamental to the process of sanitising drinking water; some parasites are resistant to chemical disinfectants such as chlorine, so it provides a failsafe.	0
NewsClaims	24435	Though there hasn’t been any research looking at how UVC affects Covid-19 specifically, studies have shown that it can be used against other coronaviruses, such as Sars.	0
NewsClaims	24436	In China, whole buses are being lit up by the ghostly blue light each night, while squat, UVC-emitting robots have been cleaning floors in hospitals.	0

NewsClaims	24444	4 COVID-19 myths	0
NewsClaims	24445	Last updated Oct.	0
NewsClaims	24446	13, 2020	0
NewsClaims	24447	Have you heard the one about how the coronavirus (COVID-19) isn’t nearly as bad as catching the flu?	0
NewsClaims	24448	"How about the claim that only ""old people"" need to worry about COVID-19?"	0
NewsClaims	24449	after	0
NewsClaims	24450	you’ve been infected?	0
NewsClaims	24451	None of these things are true.	0
NewsClaims	24452	But myths like these can gain a lot of traction because people read or hear about them and then repeat them to friends and family.	0
NewsClaims	24453	"That’s why it’s important to separate fact from fiction before hitting the ""share"" button."	0
NewsClaims	24454	"""Besides practicing social distancing and regular handwashing, sharing accurate information is one of the best things we can do to help slow the spread of COVID-19,"" says infectious diseases and infection control specialist Roy Chemaly, M.D."	0
NewsClaims	24455	To set the record straight, here’s what he wants you to know about some of the most common myths related to COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	24456	"Myth #1: COVID-19 only affects ""old people,"" so I’m not at risk."	0
NewsClaims	24457	Fact: The COVID-19 pandemic concerns everyone, because people of any age can be infected with the virus that causes it.	0
NewsClaims	24458	And while most cases of COVID-19 are mild, the elderly and people with chronic health conditions, such as cancer, are even more vulnerable.	0
NewsClaims	24459	Children appear to be both less susceptible to infection by the virus and less likely to develop COVID-19 as a result.	0
NewsClaims	24460	"Still, says Chemaly, ""It’s important to remember that healthy people in their 30s and 40s have developed severe COVID-19 symptoms, and some people with chronic health conditions in their 70s and 80s have not."	0
NewsClaims	24461	"So, no one is risk-free."""	0
NewsClaims	24462	Fact: Bacteria that causes food-borne illness can be destroyed by exposing it to high temperatures during the cooking process.	0
NewsClaims	24463	The same can be said of some other microorganisms, too.	0
NewsClaims	24464	If you actually	0
NewsClaims	24465	have	0
NewsClaims	24466	the coronavirus, though, the best thing you can do is stay at home.	0
NewsClaims	24467	Take care of yourself there until the infection has run its course, or until your symptoms become severe enough that you need to seek medical attention.	0
NewsClaims	24468	"""There is no existing treatment right now that can actually kill the virus,"" says Chemaly."	0
NewsClaims	24469	"""At this point, we can only treat the symptoms."	0
NewsClaims	24470	Myth #3: COVID-19 is not as bad as the flu.	0
NewsClaims	24471	Fact: COVID-19 is different from the flu in several important ways.	0
NewsClaims	24472	First, the 2019 novel coronavirus appears to be more contagious.	0
NewsClaims	24473	Second, symptoms of the flu tend to come on suddenly, then get worse within a day or two.	0
NewsClaims	24474	Symptoms of COVID-19 can be mild and much more gradual, building up over several days or even weeks.	0
NewsClaims	24475	Third, while most flu-related deaths are caused by secondary infections (such as pneumonia) or other complications, most deaths stemming from COVID-19 are caused by the body’s immune response to the virus itself.	0
NewsClaims	24476	"""The severe respiratory distress syndrome that some people develop as a result of infection makes it hard for them to breathe,"" explains Chemaly."	0
NewsClaims	24477	"""Finally, because we haven’t encountered this particular coronavirus before as a species, we have no vaccine, no effective anti-viral treatment, and no immunity, whereas we have all three of those for the flu,"" Chemaly says."	0
NewsClaims	24478	Myth #4: Social distancing doesn’t apply to me.	0
NewsClaims	24479	"Fact: This myth has multiple variations: everything from, ""I don’t have any symptoms, so I can still go out,"" to ""my local or state government hasn’t put a stay-at-home order in place, so I don’t need to do it"" to ""there aren’t that many coronavirus cases in my area, so I don’t need to worry"" – or even ""I’ve been pretty good about staying home, so it’s OK if I make an exception and go out this time."""	0
NewsClaims	24480	But they’re all untrue.	0
NewsClaims	24481	According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some people infected with the coronavirus may not show any symptoms.	0
NewsClaims	24482	That means they might not even know they have COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	24483	"""And just because someone doesn’t"	0
NewsClaims	24484	know	0
NewsClaims	24485	"they have the coronavirus, doesn’t mean they’re not contagious,"" says Chemaly."	0
NewsClaims	24486	"That’s also why no city, part of town or neighborhood can be considered ""safe,"" even if few confirmed cases have been reported there yet."	0
NewsClaims	24487	"""Don’t underestimate your personal risk for coronavirus — or put others at risk — based on a false claim,"" says Chemaly."	0

NewsClaims	24518	(CNN) As the novel coronavirus -- and panic about the coronavirus -- continues to spread around the world, so too are bogus claims, conspiracy theories and misinformation about the disease.	0
NewsClaims	24519	"There's so much inaccurate information floating around out there that the World Health Organization is calling it an ""infodemic."""	0
NewsClaims	24520	In perhaps the clearest sign of the times, WHO has joined TikTok to help set the record straight.	0
NewsClaims	24521	The myths exist both on the fringes of the internet and in more mainstream outlets.	0
NewsClaims	24522	And while social media platforms are now taking steps to elevate credible information and remove content that could confuse people, they're fighting an uphill battle.	0
NewsClaims	24523	Meanwhile, censorship and government mistrust in some countries have created a petri dish for misinformation to spread.	0
NewsClaims	24524	Here's the truth about the new coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	24525	Reality: Don't believe everything you read on the internet.	0
NewsClaims	24526	The rumors, which originated from unverified social media accounts and weren't supported by any credible evidence, got more elaborate as time went on.	0
NewsClaims	24527	Another that gained traction among nationalistic parts of the Chinese social mediasphere suggested that the virus originated in the US -- and that many Americans thought to have died of the flu this season were actually killed by COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	24528	Scientists in both China and the West have widely dismissed these theories, though that hasn't stopped them from spreading.	0
NewsClaims	24529	Experts are still trying to figure out the exact source of the virus, but research indicates that it likely originated in bats and was transmitted to an intermediate host before jumping to people -- just like its cousin that caused the 2003 SARS epidemic.	0
NewsClaims	24530	Reality: Garlic is good for you.	0
NewsClaims	24531	So is water.	0
NewsClaims	24532	And vitamin C. But despite what some corners of social media would have you believe, there's Garlic is good for you.	0
NewsClaims	24533	So is water.	0
NewsClaims	24534	But if the virus is already in your body, putting those substances on your skin or under your nose won't kill it -- and can actually be dangerous.	0
NewsClaims	24535	And this should go without saying, but please, please, do not ingest chemical disinfectants either.	0
NewsClaims	24536	There's currently no cure for the novel coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	24537	And while research is underway, it could be more than a year before a vaccine becomes available.	0
NewsClaims	24538	The best way to protect yourself right now is to do what you would every cold and flu season.	0
NewsClaims	24539	Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze with your elbow or a tissue that you throw away immediately after.	0
NewsClaims	24540	And disinfect the objects and surfaces you touch.	0

NewsClaims	24554	Given the shortage of masks in the US and the resulting price-gouging , US officials have warned the public not to hoard masks, particularly N95 respirators, so that they remain available to those most at risk.	0
NewsClaims	24555	Those who should wear masks are people who already have the new coronavirus and could potentially infect others, those caring for an infected patient in close settings and health care workers.	0
NewsClaims	24556	Outside the US, the guidance around face masks is different.	0
NewsClaims	24557	Authorities across Asia, which has now been dealing with the virus for months, have urged that people wear surgical masks particularly on public transportation or in other crowded places to prevent transmission of the virus.	0
NewsClaims	24558	However, Hong Kong's health authority does say that N95 respirators are generally not recommended for use by the general public, given that wearing and removing it properly requires special training.	0
NewsClaims	24559	To determine whether you need to wear a mask or not, it's best to check the latest guidance issues by your country's health authorities.	0
NewsClaims	24560	The organization also says that UV lamps shouldn't be used to sterilize hands or other areas of the body because the radiation can irritate skin.	0
NewsClaims	24561	President Donald Trump has previously suggested that heat kills the virus and that because of this, the current outbreak will have dissipated by spring.	0
NewsClaims	24562	Reality: Feel free to check your mail.	0
NewsClaims	24563	Researchers are still studying exactly how the new coronavirus infects people, but judging by previous coronaviruses, it doesn't stay alive for long on objects and surfaces.	0
NewsClaims	24564	Myth: Kids can't get the coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	24565	Reality: Anyone of any age can get the new coronavirus, though older people and those with pre-existing medical conditions appear to be more vulnerable to serious infections.	0
NewsClaims	24566	While most confirmed cases of the virus have occurred in adults, children have been infected too, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention	0
NewsClaims	24567	Myth: People who get the coronavirus will die	0
NewsClaims	24568	Reality: Officials Officials estimate the death rate for the virus to be around 3% to 4% globally, based on the information they have, though they expect that number to fall.	0
NewsClaims	24569	People who get coronavirus will typically get sick with a mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness, similar to a common cold.	0
NewsClaims	24570	Symptoms include a runny nose, cough, sore throat, headache and a fever that can last for a couple of days.	0
NewsClaims	24571	Most of the time, symptoms will go away on their own.	0
NewsClaims	24572	The disease can be fatal but those cases are rarer.	0
NewsClaims	24573	For those with a weakened immune system, the elderly and the very young, there's a chance the virus could cause a lower, and much more serious, respiratory tract illness like pneumonia or bronchitis.	0
NewsClaims	24574	Given that thousands of people have been infected and authorities are still struggling to contain the virus, though, even a 3% to 4% mortality rate is worrisome.	0
NewsClaims	24575	CORRECTION: This story has been corrected to reflect the varied guidance around face masks in countries outside the US.	0
NewsClaims	24576	A clinical hold on a potential treatment for COVID-19 is becoming political.	0
NewsClaims	24577	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) placed a hold on the Emergency Use Authorization for convalescent plasma as a potential treatment for COVID-19 over what was described as a lack of robust data supporting its use.	0
NewsClaims	24578	"""The three of us are pretty aligned on the importance of robust data through randomized control trials, and that a pandemic does not change that,"" Lane told the Times, as reported by CNN."	0
NewsClaims	24579	Convalescent plasma is collected from patients who have recovered from a virus such as the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	24580	The idea is that the plasma, which contains antibodies against the virus, will be administered into patients who are critically ill.	0
NewsClaims	24581	That pathway is still available for physicians to use should they deem it necessary, but the granting of a broader EUA is still up for debate – and that is not sitting well with President Donald Trump.	0
NewsClaims	24582	During a press briefing Wednesday, Trump questioned whether or not the decision to withhold EUA was political, rather than clinical.	0
NewsClaims	24583	“I hear great things about it ... that’s all I can tell you,” Trump said, according to CNBC.	0
NewsClaims	24584	“It could be a political decision because you have a lot of people over there who don’t want to rush things because they want to do it after Nov. 3, and you’ve heard that one before.”	0
NewsClaims	24585	Trump added that he heard convalescent plasma was “good” from “people at the FDA” and said it should be approved “if it’s good.” He stated that success rates from the use of convalescent plasma are “way over” 50% and urged approval of the plasma treatment.	0
NewsClaims	24586	That guideline could change as there are multiple convalescent plasma clinical studies being conducted across the globe.	0
NewsClaims	24587	Takeda Pharmaceutical is known to be working on developing a treatment for COVID-19 from the blood of patients who have recovered.	0
NewsClaims	24588	Takeda’s TAK-888 is an anti-SARS-CoV-2 polyclonal hyperimmune globulin currently in development to treat high-risk individuals with COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	24589	The state of New York, which was the U.S. epicenter for COVID-19 in the spring, initiated a clinical trial to study the efficacy of the blood-based treatment.	0
NewsClaims	24590	This week, the U.S. Department of Defense awarded Plasma Technologies a $750,000 contract to scale up convalescent plasma as a potential COVID-19 treatment.	0
NewsClaims	24591	The use of convalescent plasma has been studied in outbreaks of other respiratory infections, including the 2009-2010 H1N1 influenza virus pandemic, 2003 SARS-CoV-1 epidemic, and the 2012 MERS-CoV epidemic.	0
NewsClaims	24592	“Although promising, convalescent plasma has not been shown to be effective in every disease studied.	0
NewsClaims	24593	It is therefore important to determine through clinical trials, before routinely administering convalescent plasma to patients with COVID-19, that it is safe and effective to do so,” the FDA said in its guidance back in March.	0

NewsClaims	24595	Health authorities found virus strains in humans and in mink which showed decreased sensitivity against antibodies, potentially lowering the efficacy of future vaccines, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said.	0
NewsClaims	24596	"""We have a great responsibility towards our own population, but with the mutation that has now been found, we have an even greater responsibility for the rest of the world as well,"" Frederiksen told a news conference."	0
NewsClaims	24597	The findings, which have been shared with the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, were based on laboratory tests by the State Serum Institute, the Danish authority dealing with infectious diseases.	0
NewsClaims	24598	"""The Danish authorities are investigating the epidemiological and virological significance of these findings."""	0
NewsClaims	24599	Authorities in Denmark said five cases of the new virus strain had been recorded on mink farms and 12 cases in humans, and that there were between 15 million and 17 million mink in the country.	0
NewsClaims	24600	Outbreaks at mink farms have persisted in the Nordic country, the world’s largest producer of mink furs, despite repeated efforts to cull infected animals since June.	0
NewsClaims	24601	Denmark’s police, army and home guard will be deployed to speed up the culling process, Frederiksen said.	0
NewsClaims	24602	Christian Sonne, professor of Veterinary and Wildlife Medicine at Aarhus University, said in an email he believed culling the herd now as a precautionary measure was a sound decision and could prevent a future outbreak that would be more difficult to control.	0
NewsClaims	24603	Sonne co-authored a letter published in the journal Science last week calling for the cull.	0
NewsClaims	24604	"""China, Denmark, and Poland should support and extend the immediate and complete ban of mink production,"" Sonne and his co-authors wrote last week."	0
NewsClaims	24605	Tougher lockdown restrictions and intensified tracing efforts will be implemented to contain the virus in some areas of Northern Denmark, home to a large number of mink farms, authorities said.	0
NewsClaims	24606	"""The worst case scenario is a new pandemic, starting all over again out of Denmark,"" said Kare Molbak, director at the State Serum Institute."	0

NewsClaims	24611	As Science went to press, the number of confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, dubbed 2019-nCoV, had shot up to more than 4500, most of them in mainland China but more than 80 in 17 other countries and territories.	0
NewsClaims	24612	China has quarantined 35 million people in Wuhan and several other cities in a desperate attempt to slow the spread of the virus.	0
NewsClaims	24613	But as the case numbers keep soaring, the realization has set in that it may be too late to have much impact.	0
NewsClaims	24614	Even seasoned epidemiologists are astonished at the virus's dizzying spread.	0
NewsClaims	24615	Early estimates of the number of infected people—thought to far exceed the number of confirmed cases—became obsolete overnight.	0
NewsClaims	24616	“Our original results are NO LONGER VALID,” University of Hong Kong epidemiologist Gabriel Leung tweeted on 22 January, 1 day after his group had posted its first mathematical model of the epidemic.	0
NewsClaims	24617	Leung is now estimating that Wuhan alone had 43,590 infections by 25 January—and that the number is doubling every 6 days.	0
NewsClaims	24618	“How widespread does this go?” asks Marion Koopmans, a virologist at Erasmus Medical Center.	0
NewsClaims	24619	“This deserves our full attention.”	0
NewsClaims	24620	Early this week, the World Health Organization (WHO) had not yet declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the loudest alarm the agency can sound.	0
NewsClaims	24621	In meetings on 22 and 23 January, a special WHO committee that includes Koopmans was divided on whether a PHEIC was warranted, in part because there was no evidence the disease was spreading between people outside of China.	0
NewsClaims	24622	But by 28 January, several countries had reported local human-to-human transmission, which may change the equation.	0
NewsClaims	24623	So far 2019-nCoV appears to be milder than its cousin, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which had a mortality rate of 10%.	0
NewsClaims	24624	Only 106 deaths have been recorded to date.	0
NewsClaims	24625	But hundreds more people are seriously ill, and their fate is unclear.	0
NewsClaims	24626	And countless other questions remain.	0
NewsClaims	24627	Scientists don't know how long the incubation period lasts or whether infected people who show no symptoms can transmit the virus.	0
NewsClaims	24628	China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported on 26 January that a seemingly healthy man appeared to have infected “a few colleagues.” If asymptomatic people frequently infect others, it could vastly complicate efforts to contain 2019-nCoV.	0
NewsClaims	24629	The virus's explosive spread has been met by an unprecedented rush by scientists to uncover its origins, find treatments, and develop vaccines that could save millions of lives if the world really does face a pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	24630	Here are some of the ways researchers are attempting to better understand 2019-nCoV and reduce its harm.	0
NewsClaims	24631	Where Did the Virus Come From?	0
NewsClaims	24632	Almost certainly from animals, but when and how are mysteries.	0
NewsClaims	24633	Genetic analyses are starting to yield some clues.	0
NewsClaims	24634	Chinese researchers first shared a genomic sequence of 2019-nCoV on 11 January.	0
NewsClaims	24635	Labs in China and abroad have since announced nearly three dozen additional sequences of the virus—“a stellar job,” Koopmans says.	0
NewsClaims	24636	That doesn't mean 2019-nCoV jumped directly from bats to humans, says evolutionary biologist Kristian Andersen of Scripps Research.	0
NewsClaims	24637	SARS, for example, probably moved from bats to civets—sold as a delicacy in many markets—to humans.	0
NewsClaims	24638	On 27 January, Xinhua reported that researchers have found evidence of the new coronavirus in 33 of 585 environmental samples taken at the market on 1 January—the day it was closed—and on 12 January.	0
NewsClaims	24639	They all came from the western end, which had a concentration of booths selling wildlife.	0
NewsClaims	24640	That indicates the market played a role in spreading the virus, says Daniel Lucey, an infectious disease specialist at Georgetown University—but he says other data suggest it wasn't the origin.	0
NewsClaims	24641	In that group, 12 others also had no links to the market.	0
NewsClaims	24642	Lucey contends the virus was already circulating silently among humans before it contaminated the seafood market, possibly by infected animals, humans, or both.	0
NewsClaims	24643	CREDITS: (GRAPHIC) C. BICKEL/SCIENCE; (DATA) TREVOR BEDFORD/NEXTSTRAIN.ORG The genomic data cannot pinpoint the origin, but they do show that the jump from animals to humans happened recently, Koopmans says.	0
NewsClaims	24644	An analysis of the first 30 publicly posted sequences shows they differ from each other by no more than seven nucleotides (see graphic, right).	0
NewsClaims	24645	Bin Cao, a pulmonary specialist at Capital Medical University in Beijing and the corresponding author of The Lancet article, agrees the story is more complicated than many thought.	0
NewsClaims	24646	“But to be honest, we still do not know where the virus came from now.”	0
NewsClaims	24647	Could Existing Drugs Work?	0
NewsClaims	24648	It may take years to develop treatments specifically designed for 2019-nCoV, but researchers hope existing drugs can help.	0
NewsClaims	24649	Wuhan's Jin Yintan Hospital has already launched a randomized, controlled trial of the anti-HIV drug combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, according to the report in The Lancet.	0
NewsClaims	24650	There's a precedent from the SARS outbreak: In a nonrandomized trial published in 2004, researchers saw an “apparent improved outcome” from the same two protease inhibitors, combined with a third drug, ribavirin, in SARS patients.	0
NewsClaims	24651	Saudi Arabia is now conducting a trial with the same protease inhibitors, combined with interferon beta-1b, against Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), a coronavirus distantly related to SARS and 2019-nCoV that is occasionally spread by camels.	0
NewsClaims	24652	But in a recent mouse study by Ralph Baric of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, this cocktail had lackluster results against MERS.	0
NewsClaims	24653	The same study showed better outcomes for remdesivir, an experimental drug made by Gilead and previously tested against Ebola that interferes with the viral polymerase enzyme.	0
NewsClaims	24654	Remdesivir combined with interferon slowed viral replication in MERS-infected mice, and their lung function improved.	0
NewsClaims	24655	“Remdesivir has had activity against every coronavirus we've tested, and I'd be surprised if it didn't have activity against” 2019-nCoV, says co-author Mark Denison, a virologist at Vanderbilt University.	0
NewsClaims	24656	Development of entirely new treatments has started as well.	0
NewsClaims	24657	The ideal treatment for 2019-nCoV may well be a drug like remdesivir plus monoclonal antibodies, Denison says.	0
NewsClaims	24658	“The idea of using those in combination would have profoundly good prospects.”	0

NewsClaims	24662	"It launched a page on its website called Coronavirus Rumor Control to fight the misinformation as officials work to assure the public there is, in fact, no ""national quarantine,"" nor has FEMA deployed ""military assets."""	0
NewsClaims	24663	"""No, FEMA does not have military assets,"" the site notes."	0
NewsClaims	24664	"Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf told Fox News on Saturday that ""we have no plans for a national lockdown or a national quarantine,"" calling that disinformation."	0

NewsClaims	24669	First casualty of war	0
NewsClaims	24670	In a sense, it's not surprising that bad information spreads during a crisis, says Gary Webb, chair of the Department of Emergency Management and Disaster Science at the University of North Texas.	0
NewsClaims	24671	"""People are just seeking out information, where we're kind of searching for answers and trying to kind of muddle our way through all of this ambiguity and and uncertainty,"" Webb tells NPR."	0
NewsClaims	24672	"""And I think in any time we face a situation like that, there's going to be kind of an explosion in information."	0
NewsClaims	24673	"And not all of that is going to be credible and accurate information."""	0
NewsClaims	24674	Part of the blame for the ease with which rumors and bad information spreads is due to social media, Webb says.	0
NewsClaims	24675	"""So many people rely on it to communicate with friends and family members."	0
NewsClaims	24676	"And it's for many people a primary source of information,"" he says."	0
NewsClaims	24677	"""But at the same time, we know that social media can also be bombarded with inaccurate information."""	0
NewsClaims	24678	Swimming with the sharks	0
NewsClaims	24679	Some of the misinformation that spreads in times of crisis is less than harmful.	0
NewsClaims	24680	There were rumors claiming sharks were swimming in the streets during Hurricane Florence — perhaps the inspiration for recent false claims that dolphins were spotted frolicking in the canals of Venice because the water was now clean due to a coronavirus-related lack of boat traffic.	0
NewsClaims	24681	It's not clear where much of this material originates, although Trump administration officials have blamed foreign governments.	0
NewsClaims	24682	"""What we know — whether it's Russia, or whether it's other cyber actors... [is] they like to sow discord on any controversial issue,"" Wolf said on another Fox show."	0
NewsClaims	24683	"""So, it doesn't just have to be elections."	0
NewsClaims	24684	It can be any issue.	0
NewsClaims	24685	"And we're seeing that now with the coronavirus."""	0
NewsClaims	24686	Trump himself was angered that a spokesman for China's foreign ministry falsely alleged that the U.S. Army had introduced the coronavirus to Wuhan, its original epicenter in China.	0
NewsClaims	24687	"Webb isn't convinced much of misinformation that spreads in crises has sinister origins, saying much of it ""stems from some inconsistent messaging that's coming out about the virus."	0
NewsClaims	24688	"And I think that inconsistency is really happening at all levels."""	0
NewsClaims	24689	"FEMA, he says, is ""trying to reduce some of those inconsistencies and also reduce some of the confusion and ambiguity"" with its website."	0
NewsClaims	24690	Hucksters and flimflam	0
NewsClaims	24691	A related problem: In a crisis there are always those who try to illegally cash in.	0
NewsClaims	24692	Another myth that FEMA is rebuking holds that the government is currently mailing out $1,000 checks to Americans.	0
NewsClaims	24693	Although members of Congress are debating relief legislation, the particulars aren't yet final.	0
NewsClaims	24694	"FEMA says: ""The U.S. government is not mailing checks in response to COVID-19 at this time."	0
NewsClaims	24695	"Anyone who tells you they can get you the money now is a scammer."""	0
NewsClaims	24696	Attorney General William Barr vowed at the White House on Monday that the Justice Department would crack down on coronavirus scammers.	0
NewsClaims	24697	That followed action by the department to shut down a website that was offering what it called a vaccine kit — a fraud.	0
NewsClaims	24698	The Justice Department alleged that the operators of the website were running a wire fraud scheme to profit off of the fear around the COVID-19 pandemic.	0

NewsClaims	24724	Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was involved in the emergence of the coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	24725	A biological weapon?	0
NewsClaims	24726	"The retrovirus (RNA-containing viruses, which includes HIV) belongs to the same genome ""class"" as drosophiles, white mice, Escherichia coli and its plasmid/ring genome, which is convenient for rapid laboratory reproduction of modified genetic engineering."	0
NewsClaims	24727	To imagine that a world pandemic has arisen as a result of mutations in drosophila or white mice is as ridiculous as to claim the same thing about retrovirus.	0
NewsClaims	24728	There are a variety of relevant factors: the warm winter and coming cool summer,the outbreak occurring in Wuhan where bioweapon labs are located, the US extensive research modifying retro-viruses in bats to be embedded in the human genome, the current level of bio-science– With all of this in mind, the artificial origin of the current coronavirus seems probable.	0
NewsClaims	24729	According to UWI sources in the medical industry engaged in the study of COVID-19, the specific features of the novel coronavirus (rapid mutation, gradual weakening, etc.)	0
NewsClaims	24730	show that it is synthetic, made in the laboratory.	0
NewsClaims	24731	Survivors have problems with the lungs (fibrosis), and the genome has the potential to develop into cancer.	0
NewsClaims	24732	Thus the real danger for the survivors will come in future.	0
NewsClaims	24733	In theory, the new coronavirus is quite suitable as a biological weapon.	0
NewsClaims	24734	The virus is respiratory, meaning it spreads effectively.	0
NewsClaims	24735	It has a long incubation period.	0
NewsClaims	24736	The coronavirus takes control of the first stages of the infection.	0
NewsClaims	24737	It can suppress the immune response in the first stages.	0
NewsClaims	24738	When the number of copies exceeds a certain level, an immunity is triggered, but already as a systemic immune response.	0
NewsClaims	24739	This response is so strong that it leads to lung damage.	0
NewsClaims	24740	The immune system gives such a strong answer that in lungs is formed edema, their vital volume is reduced to a minimum, making it impossible for the victim to breathe.	0
NewsClaims	24741	"For example, both American and Chinese researchers criticized an Indian paper which claimed that four unique inserts in COVID-19, all of which are similar to amino acid residues in key structural proteins of HIV-1, are ""unlikely to be fortuitous in nature,"" suggesting that the virus might have been designed."	0
NewsClaims	24742	Or perhaps these scientists have something they want to conceal?	0
NewsClaims	24743	A dangerous experiment	0
NewsClaims	24744	In 2015, Professor Ralph Baric, the head of the Department of Epidemiology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, made a chimera coronavirus and published an article showing its potential danger.	0
NewsClaims	24745	Nature magazine reported on the experiment.	0
NewsClaims	24746	The researchers had experimented with the creation of a hybrid coronavirus by crossing the surface protein SHC014 with the SARS virus in bats.	0
NewsClaims	24747	The result was a mutant virus that develops very quickly and actively in human cells, and is extremely deadly.	0
NewsClaims	24748	The discovery sparked a heated debate in the scientific community.	0
NewsClaims	24749	Scientists at the time said a deadly virus could leak out of the lab, taking a lot of lives.	0
NewsClaims	24750	The fact that the experiment was conducted after US authorities imposed a moratorium on funding research on influenza viruses such as SARS and MERS in 2014 has also sparked criticism, as an exception seems to have been made in this case.	0
NewsClaims	24751	"""The only impact of this work is the creation, in a lab, of a new, non-natural risk"", said Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist and biodefense expert at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey."	0
NewsClaims	24752	So we have scientific research that has proven the possibility of creating a deadly virus based on coronavirus found in Chinese bats.	0
NewsClaims	24753	The research was conducted in the US, and although this kind of research was prohibited, the government made an exception for it.	0
NewsClaims	24754	In 4 years, the US ran simulations where the virus emerged in China and led to the death of half a million people in the US itself.	0
NewsClaims	24755	During the exercise, there were reports of a possible diversion of biological weapons from a military laboratory in Fort Detrick.	0

NewsClaims	24855	SARS-CoV-2 Transmission and Children	0
NewsClaims	24856	(Last update 26 March 2021)	0
NewsClaims	24857	Children and adolescents have lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 than adults, and children younger than 10-14 years appear to be less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 than older children and adults (20 years and older).	0
NewsClaims	24858	This has been concluded by multiple systematic literature reviews, although heterogeneity in study results has been reported [6,7].	0
NewsClaims	24859	In one of these studies, children (under 20 years of age) had a pooled odds ratio (OR) of being an infected contact of 0.56 (95% CI 0.37-0.85) compared to adults, albeit with substantial study heterogeneity [6].	0
NewsClaims	24860	Further stratification by age showed that the lower susceptibility was limited to those younger than 10-14 years [6].	0
NewsClaims	24861	This finding was also observed for infections by B.1.1.7 variant SARS-CoV-2, which is more transmissible than wild-type SARS-CoV-2 across all age groups [8,9].	0
NewsClaims	24862	There are currently few published studies that have presented data on new variants of concern and their potential transmissibility and disease severity in children, representing a knowledge gap in the field.	0
NewsClaims	24863	Several hypotheses have been formulated to explain the lower infection rates and disease severity observed in children [10].	0
NewsClaims	24864	These include that it could be due to lower case ascertainment as children are more often asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic.	0
NewsClaims	24865	However, the lower infection rates in children have been observed also in studies where asymptomatic contacts have been tested [11].	0
NewsClaims	24866	In assuming that all household contacts have an equal exposure risk to a given household index case, the authors of one systematic review hypothesised that assessing household contacts could provide a clearer indication of SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibilities.	0
NewsClaims	24867	In looking at household contacts only, the pooled OR for secondary infections among child household contacts versus secondary infections among adult household contacts was 0.41 (95% CI: 0.22-0.76) [6].	0
NewsClaims	24868	Another systematic review of household studies found higher secondary attack rates in adult contacts than in child contacts, a difference that held even when all contacts, irrespective of symptoms, were tested [11].	0
NewsClaims	24869	However, these results, as also pointed out by the authors, could not account for the type of household contacts.	0
NewsClaims	24870	Furthermore, household studies have not generally demonstrated an elevated risk of onward transmission from children.	0
NewsClaims	24871	One preprint study of 150 households in Germany found lower secondary attack rates in households where the index cases was younger than 18 years [13].	0
NewsClaims	24872	A large cohort study from Scotland of over 300 000 adults living in households with children found that the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 was slightly lower for those living with young children (0-11 years old), and that there was no increased risk for such individuals even during periods when nurseries and primary schools were open [14].	0
NewsClaims	24873	In contrast to findings from household studies, a population-based study conducted in Austria seems to indicate that children of all ages have a roughly equivalent infection risk.	0
NewsClaims	24874	A representative sample of over 10 000 randomly selected staff and students from 243 primary and secondary school were tested regardless of symptoms in three consecutive periods.	0
NewsClaims	24875	For the first three rounds (September 2020, November 2020, and March 2021), there was neither a statistically significant difference between prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests among primary school students and middle or lower secondary school students, nor between students and teachers [15].	0
NewsClaims	24876	However, the study found that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in children was substantially higher among schools with higher shares of children from socially disadvantaged backgrounds (OR: 3.58).	0
NewsClaims	24877	This study is ongoing and study participants are planned to be tested every three to five weeks at 10 different points during the 2020/2021 academic year.	0
NewsClaims	24878	A population based cohort in the United Kingdom among 9 334 392 adults aged 65 years and under found that in contrast to wave 1, evidence existed of increased risk of reported SARS-CoV-2 infection and covid-19 outcomes among adults living with children of any age during wave 2 (hazard ratio 1.06 (95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.08).	0
NewsClaims	24879	However, this did not translate into a materially increased risk of covid-19 mortality, and absolute increases in risk were small [16].	0
NewsClaims	24880	Children tend to have less severe COVID-19 outcomes than adults, meaning that children positive for SARS-CoV-2 may be under-represented in case-based reporting as well as in studies that have not tested asymptomatic contacts [17].	0
NewsClaims	24881	Population-based studies, such as the ones using representative sampling of individuals with COVID-19 compatible symptoms or studies that include testing regardless of symptoms, may help to address this gap.	0
NewsClaims	24882	SARS-CoV-2 in Educational Settings	0
NewsClaims	24883	(Last update 26 March 2021)	0
NewsClaims	24884	Although there is some heterogeneity in the findings from the literature noted above, there is general consensus from research from several European settings that schools do not act as amplifiers of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and rather that case rates in schools are following background levels of community transmission [17, 28].	0
NewsClaims	24885	A study from Sweden compared onward transmission from students in lower-secondary schools (typical student age 14-16 years) that remained open with onward transmission from students in upper-secondary schools (typical student age 17-19 years) that were closed during the study period.	0
NewsClaims	24886	The study found a small increase in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in parents of lower-secondary school students (OR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.03-1.32), but double the risk for lower-secondary school teachers versus upper-secondary school teachers (OR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.52-2.67) [23].	0
NewsClaims	24887	This may lead to the need for school closures, either in response to school-specific outbreaks or to alleviate current or anticipated risk of or increase in community transmission and the pressure on healthcare systems [26].	0
NewsClaims	24888	School closures have a negative impact on children and adolescents’ health and wellbeing, as well as on their long term educational outcomes [27], so keeping schools open when possible is a key objective [28].	0
NewsClaims	24889	School closures, if deemed necessary, should initially be arranged for children in older age groups.	0
NewsClaims	24890	Another modelling study from Denmark which assumed that children under 10 years of age were 50% less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than adults, indicates that, all other measures being constant, opening only primary schools (grades 0-4) in February 2021 would not lead to a substantial increase in new cases or hospitalisations, provided that the transmissibility of variant B.1.1.7 increases by 40% compared to the previously circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses.	0
NewsClaims	24891	Case rates increased slightly, while hospital admissions remained stable through February and March [30].	0

NewsClaims	24930	MYTH: Kids can’t catch it	0
NewsClaims	24931	Kids can catch it.	0
NewsClaims	24932	In general, they are not as likely to get as sick as some adults become, but some kids can get quite sick.	0
NewsClaims	24933	They are most likely to be affected the younger they are (12 months and under).	0
NewsClaims	24934	MYTH: Children are only contagious if they show symptoms	0
NewsClaims	24935	It is a scary thought, but you can still have and spread coronavirus even if you don’t have symptoms.	0
NewsClaims	24936	The No.	0
NewsClaims	24937	1 guideline is: No matter who or what you touch, if you wash your hands before you touch your face, you probably won’t catch it.	0
NewsClaims	24938	The risk of catching coronavirus is lower for kids who are at their home and not exposed to other kids at school or daycare.	0
NewsClaims	24939	It is good for families to practice habits like good hand hygiene and avoid kissing on the lips or sharing drinks.	0
NewsClaims	24940	MYTH: Masks are enough to protect you	0
NewsClaims	24941	The CDC recently suggested that people wear cloth face masks in public if they can’t consistently stay 6 feet away from all other persons.	0
NewsClaims	24942	But masks can be harmful if they give you a false sense of security.	0
NewsClaims	24943	Cloth masks help to keep infected people from spreading viruses when they cough or talk, but their effectiveness for protecting you from other people’s viruses can be very poor, depending on the thickness of the fabric and the number of fabric layers in the mask.	0
NewsClaims	24944	Typically, masks have been used in hospital settings to protect healthcare workers and as a reminder to not touch your face, but that’s with trained people.	0
NewsClaims	24945	When wearing a cloth face mask in public, remember to not touch your face until you have cleaned your hands, and make sure that the mask covers your nose and wraps under your chin.	0
NewsClaims	24946	And definitely wear a mask if you have to be in public with any beginning symptoms of illness, like a scratchy throat, a little cough, or change in your senses of taste or smell.	0
NewsClaims	24947	We have learned that pets may be infected with the virus, but they may have no symptoms.	0
NewsClaims	24948	Because animals can spread other diseases to people, it's always a good idea to wash your hands after handling your pets before you eat or touch your face.	0

NewsClaims	24958	The trial had two coprimary endpoints measured within 28 days from randomisation: time to first self-reported recovery, analysed using a Bayesian piecewise exponential, and hospital admission or death related to COVID-19, analysed using a Bayesian logistic regression model.	0
NewsClaims	24959	Eligible participants with outcome data were included in the primary analysis, and those who received the allocated treatment were included in the safety analysis.	0
NewsClaims	24960	The trial is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN86534580.	0
NewsClaims	24961	Findings	0
NewsClaims	24962	The first participant was recruited to PRINCIPLE on April 2, 2020.	0
NewsClaims	24963	The azithromycin group enrolled participants between May 22 and Nov 30, 2020, by which time 2265 participants had been randomly assigned, 540 to azithromycin plus usual care, 875 to usual care alone, and 850 to other interventions.	0
NewsClaims	24964	2120 (94%) of 2265 participants provided follow-up data and were included in the Bayesian primary analysis, 500 participants in the azithromycin plus usual care group, 823 in the usual care alone group, and 797 in other intervention groups.	0
NewsClaims	24965	402 (80%) of 500 participants in the azithromycin plus usual care group and 631 (77%) of 823 participants in the usual care alone group reported feeling recovered within 28 days.	0
NewsClaims	24966	We found little evidence of a meaningful benefit in the azithromycin plus usual care group in time to first reported recovery versus usual care alone (hazard ratio 1·08, 95% Bayesian credibility interval [BCI] 0·95 to 1·23), equating to an estimated benefit in median time to first recovery of 0·94 days (95% BCI −0·56 to 2·43).	0
NewsClaims	24967	The probability that there was a clinically meaningful benefit of at least 1·5 days in time to recovery was 0·23.	0
NewsClaims	24968	16 (3%) of 500 participants in the azithromycin plus usual care group and 28 (3%) of 823 participants in the usual care alone group were hospitalised (absolute benefit in percentage 0·3%, 95% BCI −1·7 to 2·2).	0
NewsClaims	24969	There were no deaths in either study group.	0
NewsClaims	24970	Safety outcomes were similar in both groups.	0
NewsClaims	24971	Two (1%) of 455 participants in the azothromycin plus usual care group and four (1%) of 668 participants in the usual care alone group reported admission to hospital during the trial, not related to COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	24972	Interpretation	0
NewsClaims	24973	Our findings do not justify the routine use of azithromycin for reducing time to recovery or risk of hospitalisation for people with suspected COVID-19 in the community.	0
NewsClaims	24974	These findings have important antibiotic stewardship implications during this pandemic, as inappropriate use of antibiotics leads to increased antimicrobial resistance, and there is evidence that azithromycin use increased during the pandemic in the UK.	0
NewsClaims	24975	Funding	0
NewsClaims	24976	Identifying treatments that can be used to speed recovery and reduce hospitalisations due to COVID-19 in the community is critically important, particularly among older adults and people with comorbidities, who are at a high risk of adverse outcomes.	0

NewsClaims	24997	Research in context	0
NewsClaims	24998	We searched PubMed on Jan 24, 2021, using the following search terms [(randomised OR trial) AND (azithromycin OR macrolide) AND (COVID* OR SARS-CoV-2 OR SARS-CoV)], with no language restrictions, and identified 243 results.	0
NewsClaims	24999	Adding a filter for clinical trials limited the number of results to 16.	0
NewsClaims	25000	Of these, we identified two randomised clinical trials with over 100 participants that provided some data on the effectiveness of azithromycin as a treatment for COVID-19 compared with control treatment or usual care.	0
NewsClaims	25001	Additional searches of medRxiv and Google Scholar on Jan 24, 2021, using similar search terms with no language restrictions, identified a further randomised clinical trial of azithromycin.	0
NewsClaims	25002	All identified trials were in hospitalised patients.	0
NewsClaims	25003	A large randomised trial among patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the UK found no difference in 28-day mortality, duration of hospital stay or treatment in hospital, or intensive care unit admissions among 2582 participants randomly assigned to receive azithromycin versus 5181 participants randomly assigned to receive usual care alone.	0
NewsClaims	25004	A randomised trial in Brazil among 675 patients admitted to hospital with mild to moderate COVID-19 found no difference in clinical status by 15 days among patients randomly assigned to receive usual care plus azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine versus usual care plus hydroxychloroquine, versus usual care alone.	0
NewsClaims	25005	A trial by the same group, among 447 patients admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19, found that patients randomly assigned to azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine, versus hydroxychloroquine alone, had poorer clinical status at 15 days, although outcomes were more similar between the two groups by 29 days.	0
NewsClaims	25006	We identified no randomised clinical trials of azithromycin as a treatment for COVID-19 in the community.	0
NewsClaims	25007	All three randomised clinical trials that we identified were in hospital settings, and only one assessed azithromycin as a standalone therapy for COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	25008	To our knowledge, PRINCIPLE is the first randomised trial to assess the effectiveness and safety of azithromycin as a standalone treatment for patients with COVID-19 in the community.	0
NewsClaims	25009	We found that azithromycin did not substantially improve time to recovery and found little evidence of an effect on admissions to hospital, when used in the community to treat COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	25010	Randomised trials have found that azithromycin is not an effective treatment for patients who are admitted to hospital with COVID-19, either alone or in combination with hydroxychloroquine.	0

NewsClaims	25114	No, Coronavirus Was Not Caused by 'Bat Soup'–But Here's What Researchers Think May Be to Blame	0
NewsClaims	25115	When news of any new, fast-spreading virus starts making the rounds, two things happen: public panic ensues and misinformation starts to proliferate—and the new coronavirus has sparked both.	0
NewsClaims	25116	In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus—now known as SAR-CoV-2 (initially named 2019-nCoV)—was detected in Wuhan, a city in Central China's Hubei province.	0
NewsClaims	25117	Since then, more than 9.6 million people worldwide have developed the infection, and at least 490,000 people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University's real-time tracker, which maps confirmed cases of the illness we now know as COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	25118	The US accounts for more than 2.4 million of those cases and nearly 125,000 deaths.	0
NewsClaims	25119	While health officials across the world—and, honestly, the entire world in general—try to figure out what exactly the new coronavirus is (Where did it start?	0
NewsClaims	25120	How is it transmitted?	0
NewsClaims	25121	What's making it so infectious?	0
NewsClaims	25122	"(Seriously—the searches for ""bat soup"" in Google Trends truly skyrocketed)."	0
NewsClaims	25123	"Where exactly did the ""bat soup"" claim come from?"	0
NewsClaims	25124	According to Foreign Policy, a video recently surfaced of a Chinese woman holding an entire bat with chopsticks, appearing to eat the creature in a soup.	0
NewsClaims	25125	The Daily Mail also reported on the video, and YouTube channel RT shared the footage.	0
NewsClaims	25126	The clip was reportedly met with outrage from Twitter users, who quickly began calling out Chinese eating habits as the cause of the outbreak.	0
NewsClaims	25127	But here's the thing, per Foreign Policy: That video in question reportedly wasn't filmed in Wuhan or China in general—the woman in the video, who news outlets have identified as Wang Mengyun, is a host of an online travel show who was actually eating a dish in Palau, an island country located in the western Pacific ocean.	0
NewsClaims	25128	The video was also reportedly filmed in 2016—well before the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan.	0
NewsClaims	25129	Mengyun has also reportedly apologized for the footage.	0
NewsClaims	25130	"""I am sorry everyone."	0
NewsClaims	25131	"I should not have eaten a bat,"" she said, according to the South China Morning Post."	0
NewsClaims	25132	“[I] had no idea during filming that there was such a virus,” she continued.	0
NewsClaims	25133	“I realized it only recently.”	0
NewsClaims	25134	So where did coronavirus originate—and is it linked to bats at all?	0
NewsClaims	25135	This is where it gets tricky: Coronaviruses in general are a large family of viruses that can affect many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, and bats, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).	0
NewsClaims	25136	In rare cases, those viruses are also zoonotic, which means they can pass between humans and animals—as was the case with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory system (SARS), two severe coronaviruses in people.	0
NewsClaims	25137	But a large number of people diagnosed with the virus reportedly didn't have exposure to the wet markets, and now it's clear that the virus is primarily spreading person-to-person, says the CDC.	0
NewsClaims	25138	"While experts still haven't pinpointed the actual source, new research released online by the CDC on April 21 concludes that SARS-CoV-2 ""is probably a novel recombinant virus""—one that has features closely related to coronaviruses found in bats and pangolins (scaly-skinned mammals)."	0
NewsClaims	25139	However, none of the existing coronaviruses represents its immediate ancestor, notes Susanna K. P. Lau, MBBS, MD, head of microbiology at the University of Hong Kong, and colleagues, who analyzed the genome of the novel coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	25140	"""Although the Wuhan market was initially suspected to be the epicenter of the epidemic, the immediate source remains elusive,"" Dr. Lau and colleagues write."	0
NewsClaims	25141	If the Wuhan market were the source, it's possible, they say, that bats carrying the bat coronavirus were mixed in the market, enabling a new combination virus to develop.	0
NewsClaims	25142	"""However, no animal samples from the market were reported to be positive,"" the team points out."	0
NewsClaims	25143	"What's more, neither the first identified case in a human nor other early patients had visited the market, ""suggesting the possibility of an alternative source."""	0
NewsClaims	25144	"Dr. Lau and colleagues' study, released ahead of publication in the CDC journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, also throws cold water on an Internet rumor that the virus may have been created in a lab: ""there is currently no evidence showing that SARS-CoV-2 is an artificial recombinant."""	0
NewsClaims	25145	Another recent paper in Nature Medicine underscores that point.	0
NewsClaims	25146	Andersen and colleagues' research implicates bats and possibly pangolins.	0
NewsClaims	25147	"Overall, the origin of the novel coronavirus is still filled with what-ifs and maybes, but even if bats are partly to blame, the likelihood that ""bat soup"" played a role is just an extremely misinformed (and potentially xenophobic) rumor."	0
NewsClaims	25148	The information in this story is accurate as of press time.	0
NewsClaims	25149	However, as the situation surrounding COVID-19 continues to evolve, it's possible that some data have changed since publication.	0

NewsClaims	25325	[238] Iranian social media had circulated a story from British tabloids that a British man and others had been cured of coronavirus with whiskey and honey,[235][239] which combined with the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers as disinfectants, led to the false belief that drinking high-proof alcohol can kill the virus.	0

NewsClaims	25332	As the COVID-19 crisis worsens, the world also faces a global misinformation pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	25333	Conspiracy theories that behave like viruses themselves are spreading just as rapidly online as SARS-CoV-2 does offline.	0
NewsClaims	25334	Here are the top 10 conspiracy theories making the rounds.	0
NewsClaims	25335	Blaming 5G	0
NewsClaims	25336	The latter are waves/photons, while the former are biological particles composed of proteins and nucleic acids.	0
NewsClaims	25337	But that isn’t really the point — conspiracy theories are enticing because they often link two things which at first might appear be correlated; in this case, the rapid rollout of 5G networks was taking place at the same time the pandemic hit.	0
NewsClaims	25338	Cue a viral meme linking the two, avidly promoted by anti-vaccine activists who have long been spreading fears about electromagnetic radiation, egged on by the Kremlin.	0
NewsClaims	25339	Even so, this conspiracy theory — after being spread by celebrities with big social media followings — has led to cellphone towers being set on fire in the UK and elsewhere.	0
NewsClaims	25340	Bill Gates as scapegoat	0
NewsClaims	25341	Most conspiracy theories, like the viruses they resemble, constantly mutate and have several variants circulating at any one time.	0
NewsClaims	25342	Many of these plots and subplots seem to involve Bill Gates, who became a new target of disinformation after gently criticizing the defunding of the World Health Organization.	0
NewsClaims	25343	According to the New York Times, anti-vaxxers, members of QAnon and right-wing pundits have seized on a video of a 2015 Ted talk given by Gates — where he discussed the Ebola outbreak and warned of a new pandemic — to bolster their claims he had foreknowledge of the COVID pandemic or even purposely caused it.	0
NewsClaims	25344	There is some truth in this, of course: vaccinating much of the world’s population may well be the only way to avoid an eventual death toll in the tens of millions.	0
NewsClaims	25345	But anti-vaxxers don’t believe vaccines work.	0
NewsClaims	25346	Instead some have spread the myth that Gates wants to use a vaccination program to implant digital microchips that will somehow track and control people.	0
NewsClaims	25347	The spread of misinformation has meant that ID2020, a small non-profit that focuses on establishing digital IDs for poorer people around the world, has had to call in the FBI.	0
NewsClaims	25348	(The Cornell Alliance for Science is partly funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.)	0
NewsClaims	25349	The virus escaped from a Chinese lab	0
NewsClaims	25350	This one at least has the benefit of being plausible.	0
NewsClaims	25351	It is true that the original epicenter of the epidemic, the Chinese city of Wuhan, also hosts a virology institute where researchers have been studying bat coronaviruses for a long time.	0
NewsClaims	25352	One of these researchers, Shi Zhengli, a prominent virologist who spent years collecting bat dung samples in caves and was a lead expert on the earlier SARS outbreak, was sufficiently concerned about the prospect that she spent days frantically checking lab records to see if anything had gone wrong.	0
NewsClaims	25353	She admits breathing a “sigh of relief” when genetic sequencing showed that the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus did not match any of the viruses sampled and studied in the Wuhan Institute of Virology by her team.	0
NewsClaims	25354	However, the sheer coincidence of China’s lead institute studying bat coronaviruses being in the same city as the origin of the COVID outbreak has proven too juicy for conspiracists to resist.	0
NewsClaims	25355	The idea was seeded originally via a slick hour-long documentary produced by the Epoch Times, an English-language news outlet based in the United States with links to the Falun Gong religious cult that has long been persecuted by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).	0
NewsClaims	25356	The theory has now tipped into the mainstream, being reported in the Washington Post, the Times (UK) and many other outlets.	0
NewsClaims	25357	COVID was created as a biological weapon	0
NewsClaims	25358	According to Pew Research, “nearly three-in-10 Americans believe that COVID-19 was made in a lab,” either intentionally or accidentally (the former is more popular: specifically, 23 percent believe it was developed intentionally, with only 6 percent believing it was an accident).	0
NewsClaims	25359	This theory that the Chinese somehow created the virus is particularly popular on the US political right.	0
NewsClaims	25360	It gained mainstream coverage thanks to US Sen. Tom Cotton (Republican, Arkansas) who amplified theories first aired in the Washington Examiner (a highly conservative media outlet) that the Wuhan Institute of Virology “is linked to Beijing’s covert bio-weapons program.”	0
NewsClaims	25361	This theory can be easily debunked now that there is unambiguous scientific evidence — thanks to genetic sequencing — that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has entirely natural origins as a zoonotic virus originating in bats.	0
NewsClaims	25362	The Examiner has since added a correction at the top of the original piece admitting the story is probably false.	0
NewsClaims	25363	The US military imported COVID into China	0
NewsClaims	25364	The Chinese government responded to the anti-China theories with a conspiracy theory of its own that seeks to turn blame back around onto the United States.	0
NewsClaims	25365	For China, as the Atlantic reported, this conspiracy theory, and an accompanying attempt to rename COVID the “USA virus,”’ was a transparent “geopolitical ploy” — useful for domestic propaganda but not widely believed internationally.	0
NewsClaims	25366	GMOs are somehow to blame	0
NewsClaims	25367	Genetically modified crops have been a target of conspiracy theorists for years, so it was hardly a surprise to see GMOs blamed in the early stages of the COVID pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	25368	Anti-GMO activists have also tried to blame modern agriculture, which is strange, since the known path of the virus into the human population — as with Ebola, HIV and many others — was through the very ancient practice of people capturing and killing wildlife.	0
NewsClaims	25369	Ironically, GMOs will almost certainly be part of any vaccine solution.	0
NewsClaims	25370	If any of the ongoing 70 vaccine projects work (which is a big if), that would be pretty much the only guaranteed way the world can get out of the COVID mess.	0
NewsClaims	25371	If GMOs do help save the world from the curse of COVID, maybe they’ll stop being a dirty word.	0
NewsClaims	25372	COVID-19 doesn’t actually exist	0
NewsClaims	25373	According to professional conspiracy theorists like David Icke and InfoWars’ Alex Jones, COVID-19 doesn’t actually exist, but is a plot by the globalist elite to take away our freedoms.	0
NewsClaims	25374	Early weaker versions of this theory were prevalent on the political right in the notion that the novel coronavirus would be “no worse than flu” and later versions are now influencing anti-lockdown protests across several states in the US.	0
NewsClaims	25375	Because believers increasingly refuse to observe social distancing measures, they could directly help to spread the epidemic further in their localities and increase the resulting death rate.	0
NewsClaims	25376	The pandemic is being manipulated by the ‘deep state’	0
NewsClaims	25377	Some believe that a “deep state” of America’s elite is plotting to undermine the president — and that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the face of the US coronavirus pandemic response — is a secret member.	0
NewsClaims	25378	Fauci’s expression of disbelief when the deep state was mentioned during a press briefing supposedly gave the game away.	0
NewsClaims	25379	COVID is a plot by Big Pharma	0
NewsClaims	25380	Many conspiracy theory promoters are in reality clever actors trying to sell quack products.	0
NewsClaims	25381	NaturalNews, another conspiracist site, sells all manner of pills, potions and prepper gear.	0
NewsClaims	25382	These conspiracists depend for their market on getting people to believe that evidence-based (i.e.	0
NewsClaims	25383	conventional) medicine doesn’t work and is a plot by big pharmaceutical companies to make us ill.	0
NewsClaims	25384	Big Pharma conspiracies are a staple of anti-vaccination narratives, so it is hardly surprising that they have transmuted into the age of the coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	25385	COVID death rates are inflated	0
NewsClaims	25386	Another far-right meme is the idea that COVID death rates are being inflated and therefore there is no reason to observe lockdown regulations or other social distancing measures.	0
NewsClaims	25387	Prominent in promoting this myth is Dr. Annie Bukacek, whose speech warning that COVID death certificates are being manipulated has been viewed more than a quarter of a million times on YouTube.	0
NewsClaims	25388	Bukacek appears in a white lab coat and with a stethoscope around her neck, making her look like an authoritative medical source.	0
NewsClaims	25389	Dig a little deeper, however, as Rolling Stone magazine did, and it turns out she’s actually a far-right anti-vaccination and anti-abortion activist, previously noted for bringing tiny plastic fetuses into the Montana state legislature.	0
NewsClaims	25390	Her insistence that COVID death rates are inflated has, of course, no basis in fact.	0
NewsClaims	25391	More likely the current death toll is a serious under-count.	0
NewsClaims	25392	T0 further clarify the issue, the Centers for Disease Control has published information about excess deaths associated with COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	25393	How to recognize and debunk conspiracy theories	0
NewsClaims	25394	It is important to speak out and combat online misinformation and conspiracist narratives, whether on COVID or climate change or anything else.	0
NewsClaims	25395	This handbook (PDF) by John Cook and Stephan Lewandowsky, both of whom have extensive experience in combating climate denialism, is an essential tool.	0
NewsClaims	25396	Note: As in previous coverage, it is our policy to avoid linking directly to websites and social media feeds that promote misinformation and conspiracy theories, so as not to drive traffic to them and give them higher visibility.	0

NewsClaims	25423	The report draws on open sources, does not provide a comprehensive or complete overview and focusses primarily on the external dimension, in line with the European External Action Service (EEAS) mandate.	0
NewsClaims	25424	The report was authored by the EEAS Strategic Communications and Information Analysis Division, which contributes to the EU’s efforts to counter disinformation, including through detection, analysis and exposure of disinformation campaigns.	0
NewsClaims	25425	In addressing disinformation and identifying and analysing disinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the EEAS is working closely with the European Commission, European Parliament services and EU Member States.	0
NewsClaims	25426	The EEAS also cooperates on this issue with international partners (G7, NATO and civil society).	0

NewsClaims	25428	Insights are shared with EU institutions and EU Member States in real time, including through the Rapid Alert System on Disinformation.	0
NewsClaims	25429	Summary	0
NewsClaims	25430	Since the last special report, COVID-19 related online mis- and disinformation decreased and shifted focus towards vaccines, according to multiple analyses of thousands of available fact-checks since the beginning of the pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	25431	The spread and reach of mis- and disinformation online remains worryingly high.	0
NewsClaims	25432	A lack of tools and access to relevant data hinders research to estimate its direct impact on human behaviour.	0
NewsClaims	25433	Based on current developments and observations, we expect that the health crisis around COVID-19 will continue to provide ample of opportunities worldwide for the spread of mis- and disinformation.	0
NewsClaims	25434	They can be expected especially concerning tightening confinement measures as well as vaccine development and distribution.	0
NewsClaims	25435	State actors like China and Russia are maximising the effect of the so-called “vaccine diplomacy” in their communication efforts, most likely with the intent to enhance their reputation and economic position abroad.	0
NewsClaims	25436	They are leveraging diplomatic channels, state-controlled media and networks of supportive and alternative media outlets and social media to distribute their messages.	0
NewsClaims	25437	While in the MENA region disinformation narratives are not yet at play given the delayed COVID-19 second wave, in Syria the regime continues to leverage COVID-19 to advance its political agenda through recurring disinformation on the EU sanctions.	0
NewsClaims	25438	the regime continues to leverage COVID-19 to advance its political agenda through recurring disinformation on the EU sanctions.	0
NewsClaims	25439	In the EU and its neighbouring countries, pro-Kremlin outlets continue to amplify voices that downplay the threat of the virus and aim to undermine governments’ strategies of curbing the second wave of infections.	0
NewsClaims	25440	Assessments facilitated by the EU Code of Practice on Disinformation show continuous efforts by platforms to curb the spread of mis- and disinformation.	0
NewsClaims	25441	However, proliferation, profitability and visibility of potentially harmful information remains high across online platforms.	0
NewsClaims	25442	The work of fact-checkers and professional, independent media since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic remains indispensable to uncover and debunk false, misleading and potentially harmful information.	0
NewsClaims	25443	Fact-checking spread has shown to have a positive impact in reducing misinformation about specific COVID-19 related claims[1].	0
NewsClaims	25444	This activity is paramount in mitigating the potential harmful consequences and enhancing societal resilience.	0
NewsClaims	25445	In detail: COVID-19 related disinformation, misinformation and other activities (May – November)	0
NewsClaims	25446	With respect to the ongoing debate[2] to establish clearly outlined definitions for various types of false, misleading and potentially harmful information, this report will make conscious references to misinformation, which “refers to untrue information that individuals spread without any intent to mislead, though the effects of such misinformation can still be harmful” and disinformation, which describes “verifiably false content that is created, presented and disseminated for economic gain or to intentionally deceive the public, and may cause public harm”.	0
NewsClaims	25447	These are often part of Information Influence Operations, which refer to coordinated efforts by either domestic or foreign actors to influence a target audience using a range of deceptive means, including suppressing independent information sources in combination with disinformation.	0
NewsClaims	25448	If in earlier reporting periods, pro-Kremlin media cast doubts on EU actions and solidarity in response to COVID-19, now the main narrative shifted towards vaccines.	0
NewsClaims	25449	Triumphant narratives[4] about Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine replaced them.	0
NewsClaims	25450	Western vaccine manufacturers are openly mocked on multi-lingual Russian state-controlled media, including for developing “the monkey vaccine”[7] (as some of the manufacturers use a chimpanzee viral vector).	0
NewsClaims	25451	In some cases, this lead to conspiracy narratives that the vaccine will “turn people into monkeys”[8].	0
NewsClaims	25452	In Italy pro-Kremlin media consistently amplify [13] local voices, which call the government’s strategy of handling the second wave of the infections senseless, including claims that the wearing of masks is useless.	0
NewsClaims	25453	Pro-Kremlin media has also called COVID-19 restrictions “a result of a bizarre psychosis and collective paranoia[14]”.	0
NewsClaims	25454	In Germany, RT has also amplified voices questioning the threat of COVID-19, and calling testing and mask-wearing into question.	0
NewsClaims	25455	An RT video[16] interview with a local physician expressing such views has been viewed over 1 million times.	0
NewsClaims	25456	There is a risk that COVID-19 related disinformation may increase as Europe is undergoing new lockdowns.	0
NewsClaims	25457	The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) documented[17] the strategical use and rapid, international spread of disinformation during the pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	25458	A completely fabricated report of fatal US COVID-19 vaccine trials was circulated via the website of the so-called “Luhansk People’s Republic” in the non-government-controlled areas, and “achieved widespread dissemination in multiple languages and across multiple communities” from the US to Australia – despite fact checks by multiple organisations across Europe.	0
NewsClaims	25459	The press release was published the day after Russia announced plans to mass-produce its own vaccine in a matter of weeks[18].	0
NewsClaims	25460	Since the last reporting period (23rd April – 18th May), over 100 new examples of pro-Kremlin linked disinformation about COVID-19 have been added to the EUvsDisinfo public database.	0
NewsClaims	25461	Articles containing these examples of disinformation received over 230 thousand likes, shares, comments on social media.	0
NewsClaims	25462	Since the outbreak of the pandemic, EUvsDisinfo has collected over 640 examples of pro-Kremlin disinformation related to COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	25463	According to our findings, currently the volume of pro-Kremlin disinformation surrounding the pandemic is smaller compared to spring (likely due to other events presenting fertile ground for disinformation campaigns, including Navalny poisoning, protests in Belarus, etc.	0
NewsClaims	25464	).	0
NewsClaims	25465	An analysis across more than 9000 fact checks by the International Fact Checking Network (IFCN) underlined that false claims, disinformation and conspiracies also follow in magnitude and focus on the informational needs of users[19].	0
NewsClaims	25466	First Draft explained this trend with information vacuums (“data deficits”[20]), where high levels of demand for information only meet low supply of available authoritative information.	0
NewsClaims	25467	Overall, Google Trends data offers indicators that online public interest in COVID-19 related information appears to be substantially lower compared to the beginning of the pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	25468	[21]	0
NewsClaims	25469	With the Middle-East and North-Africa (MENA) region potentially experiencing a delayed second COVID-19 wave compared to Europe, it is likely to assume a similarly delayed resurge of disinformation and a prevalence of vaccines-related disinformation narratives, if any.	0
NewsClaims	25470	In Syria, the regime continues to leverage COVID-19 to advance its political goals.	0
NewsClaims	25471	In line with a recurring narrative, the regime’s representative to the UN blamed the EU and the US for allegedly hindering through their sanctions the medical assistance to Syrians in the COVID-19 context as well as the reconstruction process and the returns of refugees.	0
NewsClaims	25472	[22]	0
NewsClaims	25473	A variety of false information and misleading narratives on COVID-19 have been circulating in the Western Balkans media environment since mid-March.	0
NewsClaims	25474	Local independent fact-checkers confirmed a multitude of cases of misinformation, including in relation to vaccines and health advice.	0
NewsClaims	25475	Many of these included a supportive narrative focused on children and the need to protect them, targeting family audiences.	0
NewsClaims	25476	[23] Across the region, claims that COVID-19 is a ‘fraud’ and that face masks are ‘harmful’ were shared widely on platforms such as Facebook, often in the form of sweeping statements based on ‘twisted’ statistical data.	0
NewsClaims	25477	[24] Debunking efforts were undertaken by fact-checking organisations [25] and, occasionally, also by traditional news outlets [26] .	0
NewsClaims	25478	Since spring 2020, the fact-checking community in Turkey stepped up its efforts[27] to debunk COVID-19-related misinformation.	0
NewsClaims	25479	In autumn, the number of COVID-19 related debunks was lower.	0
NewsClaims	25480	In this period, claims about the ineffectiveness or risk[28] of wearing masks, different ‘natural methods’ to prevent or test for [29] COVID-19 and some conspiracy narratives (like masks carrying tracking chips[30]) were debunked.	0
NewsClaims	25481	Occasionally these debunks were vaccine-related.	0
NewsClaims	25482	Since the beginning of the outbreak, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has utilised the pandemic to positively influence its image abroad, both by highlighting its efforts in countering COVID-19 and/or attacking and casting doubt[31] on any criticism towards it.	0
NewsClaims	25483	Generally, the communication strategy appears to be two-fold: blaming others[35] and emphasising own successes.	0
NewsClaims	25484	The current trend marks the continuation of the “mask diplomacy” now focusing on vaccines and correspondingly dubbed “vaccine diplomacy”[36].	0
NewsClaims	25485	China’s “vaccine diplomacy” is well-advanced and promoted in state-controlled media: China is promising preferential access to its COVID-19 vaccines[37] to developing countries across Asia[38], Africa[39] and Latin America[40].	0
NewsClaims	25486	According to large-scale surveys by Pew Research Center[41] and YouGov-Cambridge Globalism Project[42] (called an “illustration of Western brainwashing”[43] in the CCP-owned Global Times), China’s image abroad has suffered over the handling of the COVID-19 crisis and “vaccine diplomacy” is seen as a way to bolster diplomatic ties[44].	0
NewsClaims	25487	Chinese media and officials on Twitter have criticized the US handling of the crisis[45] and their withdrawal from multilateral initiatives[46] while reinforcing China’s commitment to the United Nations system.	0
NewsClaims	25488	In parallel, some media and officials have dismissed the US’ advances on vaccine[47] and accused it in pursuing a “new cold war”[48].	0
NewsClaims	25489	Chinese officials have also publicly[49] pointed at Australia’s call for an independent investigation on the origin of the virus as one reason for strained relations between the countries.	0
NewsClaims	25490	Australia’s trade with China has been affected[50] as a result.	0
NewsClaims	25491	Narratives shared by Chinese state-controlled media, but also by Chinese officials on Twitter notably[51] emphasize China’s response to COVID-19 as a deep commitment to multilateralism.	0
NewsClaims	25492	Domestic success stories on rapid and large-scale testing (like in Qingdao[52] and Kashgar[53]), reopening[54] of the country and the economy [55] are being promoted outside the country.	0
NewsClaims	25493	In official diplomatic channels, it translates into the promotion of China’s commitment to COVAX[56] as a sign of mutual support and justifies cooperation (like with Finland[57], Morocco[58] and other African countries[59]).	0
NewsClaims	25494	Externally, emphasis on multilateralism is tied to objectives like building a “global community of health”[60] and China’s recovering economy is depicted as exceptional and beneficial[61] to the post-pandemic world.	0
NewsClaims	25495	Social Media Platforms	0
NewsClaims	25496	The European Commission’s most recent assessment of reports[62] provided by the signatories of the EU Code of Practice on Disinformation, which highlight the actions taken to limit disinformation on COVID-19 on signatories’ respective platforms, presents the efforts to address disinformation around COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	25497	Actions by signatories range from the promotion of authoritative information sources to limiting the appearance of content containing false or misleading information, cooperation with fact-checkers as well as review of rules regarding online advertisement.	0
NewsClaims	25498	Platforms also established dedicated portals to update users on their actions to better protect users during the pandemic[63].	0
NewsClaims	25499	Despite these continuous efforts, academic research showed that mis- and disinformation continue to thrive online.	0
NewsClaims	25500	The Oxford Internet Institute found and analysed over 8000 COVID-related videos containing misinformation and conspiracies that were “shared almost 20 million times on social media, which is more than the shares gathered by the five largest English-language news sources on YouTube combined”.	0
NewsClaims	25501	[64] A study published in Nature Magazine shows that the situation could be worse on less compliant and emerging social media platforms.	0
NewsClaims	25502	[65]	0
NewsClaims	25503	The same study highlights that cross-platform traffic undermines individual platforms’ actions, which suggests a need for closer cooperation between them to effectively curb the dissemination and spread of potentially harmful material.	0
NewsClaims	25504	The need for better access to platform data to estimate impact, spread and trends of misinformation narratives remains largely unaddressed, despite privacy compliant proposals like the creation of a “Google Trends” for social media platforms[66].	0
NewsClaims	25505	August 2020 study[67] from non-profit organisation Avaaz estimated that “[g]lobal health misinformation spreading networks spanning at least five countries generated an estimated 3.8 billion views on Facebook in the last year.” Peaking in April 2020, “[h]ealth misinformation spreading websites at the heart of the networks received up to 460 million views on Facebook.” Avaaz concluded that Facebook is “failing to keep people safe and informed during the pandemic”, but could “provide all users who have seen misinformation with independently fact-checked corrections” and downgrade misinformation systematically in users’ news feeds to address the problem.	0
NewsClaims	25506	Research[68] by threat intelligence company CounterAction highlighted that over two million Germans are part of Facebook groups where COVID-19 related mis- and disinformation is circulating and amplified.	0
NewsClaims	25507	According to the research, half of the analysed posts include language that incites people to harmful behaviour, mostly concerning the vaccine.	0
NewsClaims	25508	Data showed that engagement with misinformation is not limited to political fringes, but spans party affiliation and geography.	0

NewsClaims	25510	Brussels-based NGO EU Disinfo Lab found[69] that “[i]t is possible to monetise disinformation or conspiratorial narratives on crowdfunding platforms both indirectly and directly” and that while “[s]ome crowdfunding platforms have taken action against instances of monetisation attempts connected to COVID-19 disinformation and scams […] these actions seem incoherent and are not regularly enforced.” These monetisation streams continued even when the content in question has been demonetised or removed on other social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube.	0
NewsClaims	25511	The Global Disinformation Index (GDI) found[70] that over one-third (about 200) of English language websites publishing high volumes of divisive and polarising content on inter alia COVID-19 carry advertisement which generates an estimated US$350 000 in monthly income for these websites.	0
NewsClaims	25512	“Google, as the market leader, is the ad exchange most commonly found on these worst offender sites.” In the short term, GDI proposes advertisers use available information on worst offending sites to assess the overlap between their online marketing practices with their brand identity and adjust their ads targeting in cases of a mismatch.	0

NewsClaims	25711	Quiz: How Much Do You Know About Coronavirus?	0
NewsClaims	25712	News about the novel coronavirus is breaking nearly 24-7, which makes it challenging at best to keep up with the latest scientific evidence, especially when you’re bombarded by false or misleading claims on social media.	0
NewsClaims	25713	So how much do you really know about COVID-19?	0
NewsClaims	25714	Take our quiz to gauge how knowledgeable you are.	0
NewsClaims	25715	As the world continues to battle the coronavirus, it is also fighting a different sort of epidemic: misinformation.	0
NewsClaims	25716	This “infodemic” is just as harmful as COVID-19 itself, leading people to downplay the severity of the disease and ignore public health advice in favor of unproved treatments or “cures.” A recent survey by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and Gallup found that four in five Americans say the online spread of misinformation is the biggest problem facing the media.	0
NewsClaims	25717	Even with widely available evidence to the contrary, beliefs are hard to change.	0
NewsClaims	25718	Here are some of the most insidious falsehoods about the pandemic, and why they are wrong.	0
NewsClaims	25719	In reaction to calls for an independent, international investigation into how the virus originated, China has invited researchers from the World Health Organization to discuss the scope of such a mission.	0
NewsClaims	25720	In a video from a conspiracy theory film entitled Plandemic and a book she co-authored, a woman named Judy Mikovits, who once published a high-profile, now retracted study on chronic fatigue syndrome, makes unsubstantiated claims about National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, suggesting they have used their power to profit from disease.	0
NewsClaims	25721	Science and the Web site PolitiFact have fact-checked some of the film’s claims, many of which appear elsewhere in this article.	0
NewsClaims	25722	The video was widely shared by anti-vaxxers and the conspiracy theory group QAnon.	0
NewsClaims	25723	It garnered more than eight million views on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram before it was taken down because of its false statements.	0
NewsClaims	25724	Yet the large number of people who watched it suggests misinformation spreads perniciously.	0
NewsClaims	25725	Myth 3: COVID-19 is no worse than the flu.	0
NewsClaims	25726	Starting in the early days of the pandemic, Trump repeatedly claimed that the disease is not more dangerous than seasonal influenza.	0
NewsClaims	25727	But on September 9 the Washington Post published recordings of Trump​ telling journalist and author Bob Woodward—in interviews in early February and late March—that the president knew COVID-19 was more deadly than the flu and that he wanted to play down its severity.	0
NewsClaims	25728	Although COVID-19’s exact mortality rate is hard to pin down, epidemiologists suspect it is far higher than that of the flu.	0
NewsClaims	25729	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the latter causes roughly 12,000 to 61,000 deaths per year in the U.S. By contrast, COVID-19 has caused more than 191,000 deaths in the country as of this writing.	0
NewsClaims	25730	*	0
NewsClaims	25731	Many people also have partial immunity to the flu because of vaccination or prior infection, whereas most of the world has not yet encountered COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	25732	So no, coronavirus is not “just the flu.”	0
NewsClaims	25733	Masks have long been known as an effective means of source control (preventing a sick patient from spreading a disease to others), but the early guidance was based, in part, on the fact that there was a shortage of high-quality “N95” and surgical masks.	0
NewsClaims	25734	We now know that cloth face masks can be an effective alternative.	0
NewsClaims	25735	But despite the evidence, many people still refuse to wear one, considering it a violation of civil liberties or emasculating.	0
NewsClaims	25736	Georgia’s governor Brian Kemp went so far as to sign an executive order banning city governments from implementing mask mandates.	0
NewsClaims	25737	And he sued Atlanta’s mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms when she instituted one, although he has now dropped the lawsuit.	0
NewsClaims	25738	But as coronavirus cases have spiked around the U.S. in recent months, even states that were once staunch holdouts have now implemented mask orders.	0
NewsClaims	25739	When a small, now widely criticized study in France suggested the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine might be effective at treating the disease, Trump and others seized on it and have continued to tout the medication despite growing evidence that it does not benefit COVID-19 patients.	0
NewsClaims	25740	The Food and Drug Administration initially issued an emergency use authorization for the drug, but the agency later warned against its use because of the risk of heart problems and ultimately revoked its authorization.	0
NewsClaims	25741	And in June the National Institutes of Health halted its clinical trial of the medication, stating that while it was not harmful to patients, it did not provide any benefit.	0
NewsClaims	25742	Yet Trump continues to hype the drug.	0
NewsClaims	25743	Just a few weeks ago, he retweeted a video—viewed tens of millions of times before social media companies took it down—featuring Stella Immanuel, a Houston, Tex.–based physician (who has made questionable assertions in the past, including that doctors had used alien DNA in treatments and that demons cause certain medical conditions by having sex with people in their dreams) claiming hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment for COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	25744	When thousands of people started taking to the streets in late May and June to protest the police killing of George Floyd and violence against Black Americans, some people questioned whether the mass gatherings would cause a spike in coronavirus cases.	0
NewsClaims	25745	But despite the concerns of Republicans such as Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio that the demonstrations pose as big a risk as going to church or the gym, such a marked increase from the protests has not been observed.	0
NewsClaims	25746	And those who did not attend the protests may actually have stayed home more than they would have otherwise.	0
NewsClaims	25747	The fact that the demonstrations happened outdoors, where the risk of transmission is much lower, and that many protesters wore masks likely prevented superspreading events.	0
NewsClaims	25748	Meanwhile, as states have reopened, there has been a notable increase in cases tied to bars and restaurants, as well as other indoor environments—likely because of the risk of airborne spread.	0
NewsClaims	25749	Myth 7: Spikes in cases are because of increased testing.	0
NewsClaims	25750	As coronavirus cases began surging in many parts of the U.S. in recent months, Trump has frequently claimed that these spikes are merely to the result of more people being tested.	0
NewsClaims	25751	He has tweeted that “without testing ... we would be showing almost no cases” and has said in interviews that the reason they appear to have gone up is because of increased testing.	0
NewsClaims	25752	If that scenario were true, we would expect the percentage of positive tests to go down.	0
NewsClaims	25753	But numerous analyses have shown the opposite.	0
NewsClaims	25754	The rate has risen in many states with big outbreaks (such as Arizona, Texas and Florida), while it has decreased in those that have controlled their outbreaks (such as New York), indicating that the national increase in positive tests reflects a true increase in cases.	0
NewsClaims	25755	Early on in the pandemic, some speculated that the polices chosen by the U.K. and Sweden gave the impression that they planned on letting the virus circulate through their population until they reached herd immunity—the point at which enough people are immune to the virus to prevent it from spreading to others.	0
NewsClaims	25756	(Both nations’ governments have denied that this idea was their official strategy, but the U.K. was late to issue a full lockdown, and Sweden had decided against widespread restrictions.)	0
NewsClaims	25757	There is a fundamental flaw with this approach, however: Experts estimate that roughly 60 to 70 percent of people would need to get COVID-19 to achieve herd immunity.	0
NewsClaims	25758	And given the relatively high mortality rate of the disease, letting it infect that many individuals could lead to millions of deaths.	0
NewsClaims	25759	That tragedy is what happened during the 1918 influenza pandemic, in which roughly 50 million people are thought to have perished.	0
NewsClaims	25760	The U.K.’s COVID-19 death rate is among the world’s highest.	0
NewsClaims	25761	Sweden, for its part, has had significantly more deaths than neighboring countries, and its economy has suffered, despite not shutting down.	0
NewsClaims	25762	It is likely that many lives could have been saved if these countries had acted sooner.	0
NewsClaims	25763	Myth 9: Any vaccine will be unsafe and a bigger risk than getting COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	25764	As scientists race to develop a vaccine against the disease, worrying reports have emerged that many people may refuse to get one once it is available.	0
NewsClaims	25765	Conspiracy theories about potential vaccines have circulated among anti-vax groups and in viral videos.	0
NewsClaims	25766	In Plandemic, Mikovits falsely claims that any COVID-19 vaccine will “kill millions” and that other vaccines have done so (in fact, vaccines save millions of lives each year).	0
NewsClaims	25767	Another conspiracy theory asserts that Bill Gates has a secret plan to use vaccines to implant trackable microchips in people; Gates has denied the claim, which is not supported by evidence.	0
NewsClaims	25768	Most Americans still support vaccination, yet the few voices of opposition have been growing.	0
NewsClaims	25769	A recent study observed that although clusters of anti-vaxxers on Facebook are smaller than pro-vaccination groups, they are more heavily interconnected with clusters of undecided people.	0
NewsClaims	25770	A recent Gallup poll found that one in three Americans would not get a COVID-19 vaccine if it were available today, with Republicans being less likely to be vaccinated than Democrats.	0
NewsClaims	25771	There is good reason to be cautious about the safety of a new vaccine, but that need for prudence is why the top contenders are currently conducting large-scale clinical trials in tens of thousands of people to determine safety and efficacy.	0
NewsClaims	25772	If one or more of them pass muster, it will be critical for people to get vaccinated to save lives—including, perhaps, their own.	0

NewsClaims	25792	In the official document, the magistrates assumed the conspiracy theory according to which business elites and global policies planned the pandemic in order to control the population through vaccines and establish a “new world order.”	0
NewsClaims	25793	A few days earlier, a group of Donald Trump supporters violently stormed the U.S. Capitol, disrupting the Congressional session that was to certify Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election.	0
NewsClaims	25794	The iconic image of the assault was that of Jacob Anthony Chansley, a man with a painted face and dressed in animal skin and horns.	0
NewsClaims	25795	Chansley calls himself “the shaman” of QAnon, one of the groups that participated in the Capitol break-in.	0
NewsClaims	25796	This movement is made up of followers of a conspiracy theory promoted by the U.S. far-right that claims Trump is leading the resistance against the political elites, businessmen and media who profess Satanism and practice pederasty.	0
NewsClaims	25797	Theories like QAnon have multiplied in Latin America in recent decades.	0
NewsClaims	25798	Although they rely on fake news disseminated massively through social networks, they are presented as “alternative information” and have an increasing impact on political systems, even affecting democratic institutions.	0
NewsClaims	25799	Conspiracies behind historical events	0
NewsClaims	25800	These theories consider that secret conspiracies are behind some of the most important events in history, and like fake news, are found in Internet forums, social networks and instant messaging applications: ideal channels to be disseminated.	0
NewsClaims	25801	It is a phenomenon that is difficult to define.	0
NewsClaims	25802	According to Peter Knight, it can apply to anything from elaborate theories to mere suspicions about hidden agendas.	0
NewsClaims	25803	Jack Bratich points out that one of the main characteristics of these theories is that they are labeled by society as “conspiracy theories” with the intention of marginalizing and dismissing them.	0
NewsClaims	25804	As a result, their believers tend to reinforce ties among themselves in order to seek identity reaffirmation in the face of a social majority that disdains their discourse.	0
NewsClaims	25805	In recent months, the world has witnessed unusual historical events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the start of vaccination to combat the virus, or the assault on the Capitol in the United States.	0
NewsClaims	25806	Although there have always been conspiracy hypotheses that seek to shed light on historical events, in exceptional circumstances such as the current one, they spread more effectively.	0
NewsClaims	25807	Some of the most recognized theories have emerged at critical junctures such as the French Revolution, the Bolshevik Revolution, the Crash of ’29, the World Wars, the Cold War, the Kennedy assassination, the HIV/AIDS pandemic or 9/11, to name a few.	0
NewsClaims	25808	Simple explanations such as these provide emotional reassurance to those who believe in them because they argue that the traumatic events that are occurring have a planned origin, i.e., they are intentionally provoked within the framework of a hidden plan and not by factors beyond their control.	0
NewsClaims	25809	Moreover, they acquire greater legitimacy when they are given credibility by the mass media itself.	0
NewsClaims	25810	Conspiracy theories in Latin America	0
NewsClaims	25811	In a region as convulsed as Latin America, conspiracy theories have played an important role.	0
NewsClaims	25812	Those with a global impact have coexisted with other more homegrown ones, such as the one that claims that, after the Soviet occupation of Germany, Adolf Hitler did not commit suicide but went into exile in Argentina, or one of the most recent ones that claims that former Peruvian president Alan García faked his death to escape justice.	0
NewsClaims	25813	For Mark Fenster, conspiracy theories can be effective in challenging the established order, simplifying complex political and historical events.	0
NewsClaims	25814	However, at other times they put the democratic system at risk because they can be used by extremist political groups to defame their rivals, condition electoral processes or stigmatize certain ethno-cultural, religious or political groups.	0
NewsClaims	25815	As pointed out by Karl Popper in The Open Society and its Enemies, political movements with authoritarian or totalitarian inclinations often disseminate these theories as an additional argument to discredit, persecute and repress the opposition.	0
NewsClaims	25816	These tales of hidden intrigues reinforce in their followers a Manichean vision of the world in which a minority (it can be a political, business or media elite, or an ethnic-cultural or religious group), the “bad guys”, are the ones guilty of conspiring in some way or another against the country or humanity from positions of power, while they, the “good guys”, lead the resistance.	0
NewsClaims	25817	Dictatorships and populists have resorted to conspiracy theories	0
NewsClaims	25818	In Latin America, both military dictatorships and populist movements have resorted to conspiracy theories to attack their opponents, dividing society into two antagonistic political camps.	0
NewsClaims	25819	In the 1970s, far-right academics in Argentina claimed that Jews were maneuvering a plan to transform Argentine Patagonia into a state similar to Israel.	0
NewsClaims	25820	At the beginning of the 21st century Chavista sectors in Venezuela accused the opposition of conspiring internationally with the United States and Colombia to provoke the assassination of President Hugo Chávez.	0
NewsClaims	25821	In 2016, during the plebiscite campaign about the peace accords in Colombia, extremist groups linked to the party of former President Alvaro Uribe spread the false theory that the negotiations between the government of Juan Manuel Santos and the FARC were a maneuver of “Castro-Chavism” to establish a “gay dictatorship” in the country.	0
NewsClaims	25822	In all cases these theories were used to point out who the enemies of the country are and, in this way, legitimize actions aimed at confronting them.	0
NewsClaims	25823	As Carlos Malamud points out, these discourses are not “conspiratorial” because they warn of the presence, sometimes real, of groups seeking to interfere in national affairs or subvert the established order, but because they are assigned a much greater influence and capacity than they have.	0
NewsClaims	25824	2021 is a year with many electoral processes in Latin America in which conspiracy theories, global or regional, will play an important role.	0
NewsClaims	25825	This is a crucial issue, although complex to analyze and difficult to combat.	0
NewsClaims	25826	They are complex to analyze because there is a risk of labeling dissident discourses as “conspiracy theories” just because they question the established order.	0
NewsClaims	25827	They are difficult to combat because those who believe in these types of theories do not do so because they consider them reasonable or proven, but because they reinforce a sense of individual or collective belonging to a particular group.	0

NewsClaims	25829	Dexamethasone and other corticosteroid drugs are effective treatments for seriously ill COVID-19 patients, according to a meta-analysis of seven randomized controlled trials including a total of more than 1,700 participants.	0

NewsClaims	25837	"""The results were consistent across the trials and show benefit regardless of age or sex."""	0
NewsClaims	25838	Dexamethasone has been in use in hospitals as a COVID-19 treatment for seriously ill patients for several months now, after the UK RECOVERY trial reported in June that the drug reduced mortality in COVID-19 patients ill enough to require mechanical ventilation.	0
NewsClaims	25839	The new meta-analysis reviewed data from this and two other trials of dexamethasone, plus three trials of hydrocortisone and one small study of methylprednisolone.	0
NewsClaims	25840	All three drugs are often prescribed by doctors to help dampen inflammation and other immune system responses.	0
NewsClaims	25841	They had been proposed as potential COVID-19 treatments partly because patients who die from the disease often succumb to overreactive immune responses.	0
NewsClaims	25842	The WHO has cautioned that the findings do not mean that steroids should be given to all COVID-19 patients, and the organization currently recommends doctors not to prescribe the drugs to people with mild disease.	0
NewsClaims	25843	One study included in the meta-analysis found that corticosteroids might even increase mortality in non-severe patients.	0
NewsClaims	25844	It’s still not clear exactly when steroids should be given to patients with worsening disease for the best outcome, Nahid Bhadelia, the medical director of the Special Pathogens Unit at the Boston University School of Medicine, tells	0

NewsClaims	25855	In addition to side effects affecting the heart, they are known to potentially cause liver and kidney problems, nerve cell damage that can lead to seizures (fits) and low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia).	0
NewsClaims	25856	These medicines are being used in the context of the ongoing pandemic for treating patients with COVID-19 and investigated in clinical trials.	0
NewsClaims	25857	Results from large, well-designed studies are needed to make any conclusions.	0
NewsClaims	25858	Some clinical trials currently investigating the effectiveness of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19 use higher doses than those recommended for the authorised indications.	0
NewsClaims	25859	While serious side effects can occur with recommended doses, higher doses can increase the risk of these side effects, including abnormal electrical activity that affects the heart rhythm (QT-prolongation).	0
NewsClaims	25860	Healthcare professionals are recommended to closely monitor patients with COVID-19 receiving chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine and to take into account pre-existing heart problems that can make patients more prone to heart rhythm issues.	0
NewsClaims	25861	They should carefully consider the possibility of side effects, particularly with higher doses, and exercise extra caution when combining treatment with other medicines such as azithromycin that may cause similar side effects on the heart.	0
NewsClaims	25862	Patients and healthcare professionals are reminded to report any suspected side effects to their national regulatory authorities.	0
NewsClaims	25863	A number of large, randomised clinical trials are looking at the benefits and risks of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	25864	In the context of COVID-19, these medicines should only be used as part of clinical trials or in line with nationally agreed protocols.	0

NewsClaims	25876	"Even though the World Health Organization (WHO) has tried to dispel such myths surrounding ""miracle"" foods and coronavirus, misinformation continues to circulate."	0
NewsClaims	25877	Here are some of the most common myths debunked:	0
NewsClaims	25878	Myth 1: garlic	0
NewsClaims	25879	There is some evidence showing that garlic has antibacterial effects, with existing studies indicating the active compounds of garlic (including allicin, allyl alcohol and diallyl disulfide) are protective against some types of bacteria like salmonella and staphylococcus aureus.	0
NewsClaims	25880	However, research investigating garlic’s antiviral properties is limited.	0
NewsClaims	25881	Myth 2: lemons	0
NewsClaims	25882	However, many other citrus fruits and vegetables contain vitamin C.	0
NewsClaims	25883	Myth 3: vitamin C	0
NewsClaims	25884	As previously stated, Vitamin C is known to play a role in supporting the normal functioning of the immune system.	0
NewsClaims	25885	Yet, it’s not the only nutrient that maintains the the immune system.	0
NewsClaims	25886	Most of the misinformation on vitamin C and coronavirus comes from studies that have investigated the links between vitamin C and the common cold.	0
NewsClaims	25887	Despite claims online that vitamin C can prevent and treat the common cold, the evidence in support of this is not only limited, but conflicting too.	0
NewsClaims	25888	There are also significant differences between the common cold and coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	25889	There’s currently no strong evidence that supplementing with vitamin C will prevent or cure COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	25890	Most adults will also meet their vitamin C requirements from a diet that includes a variety of fruits and vegetables.	0
NewsClaims	25891	Myth 4: alkaline foods	0
NewsClaims	25892	A pH below 7.0 is considered acidic, a 7.0 pH is neutral, and above pH 7.0 is alkaline.	0
NewsClaims	25893	However, many of these online sources give incorrect pH values to these foods.	0
NewsClaims	25894	For example, the pH of a lemon was said to be 9.9, when it’s actually very acidic, with a pH of 2.	0
NewsClaims	25895	There are claims that acidic foods can become alkaline after being metabolised by the body.	0
NewsClaims	25896	The body regulates acidity levels, regardless of the types of food being consumed.	0
NewsClaims	25897	Myth 5: keto diet	0
NewsClaims	25898	"This comes from the idea that it can ""boost"" the immune system."	0
NewsClaims	25899	Though one study showed that keto might prevent or treat the flu, this study used mice models.	0
NewsClaims	25900	This makes it difficult to know if keto would have a similar effect on humans at preventing or treating the flu.	0

NewsClaims	25903	A healthy and varied diet containing the five main food groups can help provide most people with the nutrients they need.	0
NewsClaims	25904	Most of the nutrients we already get from our regular diet (including copper, folate, iron, zinc, selenium, and vitamins A, B6, B12, C, and D) are all involved in maintaining normal immune function.	0
NewsClaims	25905	People are also encouraged to take protective measures against COVID-19, including washing hands frequently, maintaining social distancing, and following lockdown orders.	0
NewsClaims	25906	This is because our main source of vitamin D is sunlight – and because of lockdown measures, many of us aren’t getting enough sunlight exposure.	0

NewsClaims	25915	In addition, there are no EU approved nutrition and health claims that a single food or supplement can fight viral infections, like COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	25916	The novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that emerged in the city of Wuhan, China, last year and has since caused a large scale COVID-19 epidemic and spread to more than 70 other countries is the product of natural evolution, according to findings published today in the journal Nature Medicine.	0
NewsClaims	25917	"In addition to Andersen, authors on the paper, ""The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2,"" include Robert F. Garry, of Tulane University; Edward Holmes, of the University of Sydney; Andrew Rambaut, of University of Edinburgh; W. Ian Lipkin, of Columbia University."	0
NewsClaims	25918	Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause illnesses ranging widely in severity.	0
NewsClaims	25919	The first known severe illness caused by a coronavirus emerged with the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in China.	0
NewsClaims	25920	A second outbreak of severe illness began in 2012 in Saudi Arabia with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).	0
NewsClaims	25921	On December 31 of last year, Chinese authorities alerted the World Health Organization of an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus causing severe illness, which was subsequently named SARS-CoV-2.	0
NewsClaims	25922	As of February 20, 2020, nearly 167,500 COVID-19 cases have been documented, although many more mild cases have likely gone undiagnosed.	0
NewsClaims	25923	The virus has killed over 6,600 people.	0
NewsClaims	25924	Shortly after the epidemic began, Chinese scientists sequenced the genome of SARS-CoV-2 and made the data available to researchers worldwide.	0
NewsClaims	25925	Andersen and collaborators at several other research institutions used this sequencing data to explore the origins and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 by focusing in on several tell-tale features of the virus.	0
NewsClaims	25926	The scientists analyzed the genetic template for spike proteins, armatures on the outside of the virus that it uses to grab and penetrate the outer walls of human and animal cells.	0
NewsClaims	25927	More specifically, they focused on two important features of the spike protein: the receptor-binding domain (RBD), a kind of grappling hook that grips onto host cells, and the cleavage site, a molecular can opener that allows the virus to crack open and enter host cells.	0
NewsClaims	25928	Evidence for natural evolution	0
NewsClaims	25929	The scientists found that the RBD portion of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins had evolved to effectively target a molecular feature on the outside of human cells called ACE2, a receptor involved in regulating blood pressure.	0
NewsClaims	25930	This evidence for natural evolution was supported by data on SARS-CoV-2's backbone - its overall molecular structure.	0
NewsClaims	25931	If someone were seeking to engineer a new coronavirus as a pathogen, they would have constructed it from the backbone of a virus known to cause illness.	0
NewsClaims	25932	But the scientists found that the SARS-CoV-2 backbone differed substantially from those of already known coronaviruses and mostly resembled related viruses found in bats and pangolins.	0
NewsClaims	25933	"Josie Golding, PhD, epidemics lead at UK-based Wellcome Trust, said the findings by Andersen and his colleagues are ""crucially important to bring an evidence-based view to the rumors that have been circulating about the origins of the virus (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19."""	0
NewsClaims	25934	Possible origins of the virus	0
NewsClaims	25935	Based on their genomic sequencing analysis, Andersen and his collaborators concluded that the most likely origins for SARS-CoV-2 followed one of two possible scenarios.	0
NewsClaims	25936	In one scenario, the virus evolved to its current pathogenic state through natural selection in a non-human host and then jumped to humans.	0
NewsClaims	25937	This is how previous coronavirus outbreaks have emerged, with humans contracting the virus after direct exposure to civets (SARS) and camels (MERS).	0
NewsClaims	25938	There are no documented cases of direct bat-human transmission, however, suggesting that an intermediate host was likely involved between bats and humans.	0
NewsClaims	25939	In this scenario, both of the distinctive features of SARS-CoV-2's spike protein--the RBD portion that binds to cells and the cleavage site that opens the virus up--would have evolved to their current state prior to entering humans.	0
NewsClaims	25940	In this case, the current epidemic would probably have emerged rapidly as soon as humans were infected, as the virus would have already evolved the features that make it pathogenic and able to spread between people.	0
NewsClaims	25941	In the other proposed scenario, a non-pathogenic version of the virus jumped from an animal host into humans and then evolved to its current pathogenic state within the human population.	0
NewsClaims	25942	For instance, some coronaviruses from pangolins, armadillo-like mammals found in Asia and Africa, have an RBD structure very similar to that of SARS-CoV-2.	0
NewsClaims	25943	Then the other distinct spike protein characteristic of SARS-CoV-2, the cleavage site, could have evolved within a human host, possibly via limited undetected circulation in the human population prior to the beginning of the epidemic.	0
NewsClaims	25944	The researchers found that the SARS-CoV-2 cleavage site, appears similar to the cleavage sites of strains of bird flu that has been shown to transmit easily between people.	0
NewsClaims	25945	SARS-CoV-2 could have evolved such a virulent cleavage site in human cells and soon kicked off the current epidemic, as the coronavirus would possibly have become far more capable of spreading between people.	0
NewsClaims	25946	Study co-author Andrew Rambaut cautioned that it is difficult if not impossible to know at this point which of the scenarios is most likely.	0
NewsClaims	25947	If the SARS-CoV-2 entered humans in its current pathogenic form from an animal source, it raises the probability of future outbreaks, as the illness-causing strain of the virus could still be circulating in the animal population and might once again jump into humans.	0
NewsClaims	25948	The chances are lower of a non-pathogenic coronavirus entering the human population and then evolving properties similar to SARS-CoV-2.	0

NewsClaims	25981	Lock It Out	0
NewsClaims	25982	Each particle of the new virus, SARS-CoV-2, is studded with spikes, which allow it to attach itself to a human cell, poke a hole, and burrow inside.	0
NewsClaims	25983	Like the germ that caused the SARS epidemic in 2003, it sticks to a protein on human cells called ACE2, which is especially prevalent in the lungs and small intestine.	0
NewsClaims	25984	(SARS-CoV-2 is at least 10 times stickier than its cousin, which may account for its rapid spread.)	0
NewsClaims	25985	One way to stop the invader is to keep it from attaching in the first place.	0
NewsClaims	25986	This is what your immune system tries to do—it sends out antibodies that gum up the spikes so the virus can't stick to ACE2.	0
NewsClaims	25987	But there are other ways of achieving the same effect.	0
NewsClaims	25988	1.	0
NewsClaims	25989	Make a vaccine.	0
NewsClaims	25990	It contains a defanged version of the virus that your immune system can use for target practice—but it can also cause infection.	0
NewsClaims	25991	That's why many researchers are working on vaccines that contain not the whole virus but just the outer spikes.	0
NewsClaims	25992	Mixed with immune-boosting molecules called adjuvants, they'll elicit a safe antibody response.	0
NewsClaims	25993	2.	0
NewsClaims	25994	Take antibody-rich blood plasma from people who have survived Covid-19 and inject it into newly infected or at-risk patients.	0
NewsClaims	25995	Plasma won't teach the body how to fend off the virus, and one injection won't last forever—but it could be a good way to prepare health workers before they head to a hot spot.	0
NewsClaims	25996	3.	0
NewsClaims	25997	Flood the zone with decoys—synthetic molecules that look like ACE2 and trick the virus into binding with them instead, protecting lung cells from damage.	0
NewsClaims	25998	4.	0
NewsClaims	25999	Invent drugs that hinder ACE2 from binding with the virus.	0
NewsClaims	26000	In theory, these compounds would work on both SARS and Covid-19, stopping the viruses from sticking to cells.	0
NewsClaims	26001	But ACE2 plays a number of other roles throughout the body; it helps regulate blood pressure, kidney function, and even fertility.	0

NewsClaims	26032	TRUE.	0
NewsClaims	26033	The following symptoms may develop 2-14 days after exposure: fever (77-98%), cough (46-88%), or shortness of breath (3-31%).	0
NewsClaims	26034	Most people (75%) develop symptoms by 7 days following exposure.	0
NewsClaims	26035	Most people have mild symptoms and do not require care from a medical provider and should stay home until well.	0
NewsClaims	26036	Patients with more serious symptoms, like shortness of breath, should call their medical provider.	0
NewsClaims	26037	I have heard that if you can take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds without coughing, discomfort, or tightness, etc., it basically indicates no infection.	0
NewsClaims	26038	In critical time, please self-check every morning in an environment with clean air.	0
NewsClaims	26039	FALSE.	0

NewsClaims	26045	FALSE.	0
NewsClaims	26046	While drinking enough water to stay hydrated is important, drinking sips of water every 15 minutes does not prevent infection from COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	26047	Social distancing (maintaining 6 feet) from other people, frequent hand washing and avoiding touching your face will help to prevent infection with COVID-19.	0

NewsClaims	26054	Try not to drink liquids with ice.	0
NewsClaims	26055	FALSE.	0
NewsClaims	26056	Drinking water is important to stay healthy, as is eating a balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables and getting enough rest.	0
NewsClaims	26057	Drinking warm or hot liquids may soothe your throat and help a cough, but they do not prevent infection from COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	26058	COVID-19 lasts on metal surfaces or fabric for 6-12 hours.	0
NewsClaims	26059	PARTLY TRUE.	0
NewsClaims	26060	Currently it appears that COVID-19 may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials.	0
NewsClaims	26061	However, most transmission occurs from close contact or droplet transmission.	0

NewsClaims	26086	In the past, Wickramasinghe has asserted that another disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) also came from space.	0
NewsClaims	26087	"He even co-wrote a book with Fred Hoyle in the 1970s called ""Diseases from Space"" and, for decades, has tried to prove that diseases like SARS or influenza have come from space."	0
NewsClaims	26088	"It would be unprecedented to discover that a virus could survive the radiation it would be exposed to on such a long journey through space (never mind the trip back to Earth) and still be able to infect humans after it landed, astrobiologist Graham Lau, who hosts NASA's ""Ask an Astrobiologist"" series, told Space.com."	0
NewsClaims	26089	However, while it would be an incredibly unique and groundbreaking finding if this were true, Wickramasinghe simply does not have evidence to support his claims, Lau said.	0
NewsClaims	26090	"""It's one of those cases where extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,"" Lau told Space.com."	0
NewsClaims	26091	"""Even though it's an interesting idea, we just don't have any reason to embrace that idea right now."	0

NewsClaims	26095	Additionally, from what we know about the new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, it lines up with what we know about terrestrial viruses.	0
NewsClaims	26096	The virus is responsible for the disease COVID-19, which has infected more than 187,000 people globally, according to the New York Times.	0
NewsClaims	26097	"""If this thing had some different kind of biomolecule in it that's different from life as we know it,"" Lau said, then there might be reason to investigate whether the virus had extraterrestrial origins."	0
NewsClaims	26098	However, even in that case, there could be Earthly explanations, he added.	0
NewsClaims	26099	Wickramasinghe's claim ties into the theory of panspermia, a longstanding but not proven theory which poses that life on Earth originated with help from microorganisms and biological material from outer space, Lau said.	0
NewsClaims	26100	And while there is not yet concrete evidence that panspermia has occurred here on Earth or is even possible, theoretically, it could happen, he said.	0
NewsClaims	26101	Theoretically, biological materials could survive on a space rock, lie dormant and continue to survive if they were properly shielded from the radiation in space and survive the process of impacting Earth, Lau said, noting that scientists have found organic molecules such as amino acids inside meteorites.	0
NewsClaims	26102	The UK-led campaign cites a review of 100+ vitamin C trials​​ just published in Nutrients​ – some of which are specific to COVID-19; some specific to sepsis and broader respiratory issues – to back its case.	0
NewsClaims	26103	Lead author of that review and VitaminC4Covid campaign director, Patrick Holford, told NutraIngredients vitamin C data was as strong as that which existed for vitamin D and had the potential to reduce COVID-19 symptoms at low cost and “​suppress viral replication in the early stages”.​	0
NewsClaims	26104	“The critical phase of COVID-19 is a direct result of an inflammatory reaction by the body’s immune system, akin to sepsis, that only occurs if there is a large quantity of dead virus particles,”​ said Holford, who is the founder of the Food for the Brain Foundation and has written 45 nutrition-focused books.	0
NewsClaims	26105	“Early suppression and rapid resolution of symptoms, as shown in cold studies giving 4 to 8 grams of vitamin C in the first 24 hours of infection, has the potential to stop conversion to critical COVID, ​thus taking the pressure off the National Health Service.”​	0
NewsClaims	26106	The Nutrients​ review has been presented to the British Health Minister Matt Hancock as well as the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG), the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) and the National Institute for Clinical Evidence (NICE).	0

NewsClaims	26108	Holford said a key campaign focus was raising vitamin C levels in the elderly, for whom a disproportionate percentage are simultaneously affected by COVID-19 and vitamin C deficient.	0
NewsClaims	26109	The campaign seeks £10,000 (€11,000) as a minimum to screen vitamin C levels in Welsh care home residents and £200,000 (€221,000) for a definitive vitamin C and colds trial which, if started during the pandemic would also indicate the protective effect of vitamin C in those with colds that test covid positive.	0
NewsClaims	26110	“The irony is that Zhongnan Hospital ran out of COVID patients by the end of April as a consequence of the Chinese government shipping in 50 tons – 50 million 1g doses - into Wuhan on February 2nd and distributing to all hospitals which not only gave hospitalised patients high doses of vitamin C, intravenously in ICUs, but also gave daily vitamin C to all hospital workers,”​ Holford said.	0
NewsClaims	26111	Professor David Smith from Oxford University’s Department of Pharmacology and VitaminC4Covid Scientific Advisory Board Member, said evidence was mounting “that vitamin C treatment may be beneficial.” ​	0
NewsClaims	26112	Professor Smith added: “…There are some 30 trials in progress testing the therapeutic benefit of high dose vitamin C in late stage Covid-19.”​	0
NewsClaims	26113	Rob Verkerk PhD, founder, executive and scientific director at the Alliance for Natural Health (ANH) went further, stating, “​doctors and other health professionals who avoid recommendations on vitamin C in relation to COVID disease prevention and treatment, should be considered medically negligent.”​	0

NewsClaims	26120	Holford, who in 1984 established the Institute for Optimum Nutrition​​ with Nobel Prize-winning vitamin C researcher Linus Pauling, said the campaign went beyond vitamin C or even the coronavirus pandemic.	0

NewsClaims	26133	At the time, many politicians across the political spectrum, including on the left, were pushing similar messages, encouraging residents to go for aperitivos.	0
NewsClaims	26134	Then came the lockdown.	0
NewsClaims	26135	Salvini pivoted.	0
NewsClaims	26136	His new attack line: the lockdowns don’t go far enough.	0
NewsClaims	26137	#chiuderetutto — shut everything down — his social media headers read.	0
NewsClaims	26138	Inevitably, as lifelong eurosceptics, Salvini and Meloni began attacking the EU’s response to the crisis, even arguing, without evidence, that some member states wanted to exploit the pandemic to their benefit.	0
NewsClaims	26139	But with attention still running thin, the attacks have become relentless — and the content posted by Salvini and Meloni increasingly extreme.	0
NewsClaims	26140	On Wednesday, the two leaders took a conspiracy theory doing the rounds in some WhatsApp groups and pushed it to their millions of followers on Facebook and Twitter.	0
NewsClaims	26141	"""INCREDIBLE!!!"""	0
NewsClaims	26142	"""WE WANT THE TRUTH!"""	0
NewsClaims	26143	Meloni said on the social networking platform.	0
NewsClaims	26144	Both leaders called for the government to answer questions in parliament.	0
NewsClaims	26145	The conspiracy theory has been debunked by Italian fact-checkers and several news outlets, including Il Post and La Repubblica.	0
NewsClaims	26146	In short, the 2015 research had nothing to do with COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	26147	"Therefore it [COVID-19] absolutely cannot be the virus created in the Chinese lab that is discussed in the [2015] programme."""	0
NewsClaims	26148	President Joe Biden has ordered US intelligence agencies to conduct a 90-day review of what is known about the origins of Covid-19 and whether it could have escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan.	0
NewsClaims	26149	So what does this mean for the lab leak theory?	0
NewsClaims	26150	Has new evidence emerged?	0
NewsClaims	26151	Despite the Biden announcement and various stories in the US media claiming support is growing for the Wuhan lab leak theory, the answer is that surprisingly little has changed in terms of good quality evidence – at least in the public domain.	0
NewsClaims	26152	How reliable is the evidence?	0
NewsClaims	26153	The intelligence relating to the three staff at the WIV has been described as uncorroborated evidence from a foreign source, ie it was not obtained – or so far verified – by a US intelligence agency, and was initially looked at under the Trump administration.	0
NewsClaims	26154	“It was very precise,” one source told the WSJ, but added the crucial caveat: “What it didn’t tell you was exactly why they got sick.”	0
NewsClaims	26155	According to the New York Times, not one but two intelligence documents were produced discussing the sick workers, one focused on the three individuals, the second about what was known about the origins of the coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	26156	There are multiple issues, however, with how to interpret this information.	0
NewsClaims	26157	Questions include whether the symptoms seen were of coronavirus or bad flu (or something else) and whether the sickness – if it was coronavirus – was related to work in their lab, or simply suggests that Covid-19 was circulating in the general population in Wuhan a few weeks earlier than assumed.	0
NewsClaims	26158	Biden’s comments, launching the review, are revealing – not least when he said that the US intelligence community does “not believe there is sufficient information” to fully understand the likelihood of different scenarios for explaining the origin of the virus that causes Covid-19.	0
NewsClaims	26159	So where are we with the animal host theory?	0
NewsClaims	26160	Much has been made by some of the fact that no intermediate animal host – between humans and bats – has so far been identified, which has been cited in some places as somehow supporting the lab leak theory.	0
NewsClaims	26161	The reality is that identifying animal hosts in past coronavirus outbreaks has been a lengthy and uncertain process.	0
NewsClaims	26162	While it is known that dromedaries were a major reservoir host for Mers, even now the role of the animals in transmitting the virus is poorly understood.	0
NewsClaims	26163	The same was true with the Sars outbreak.	0
NewsClaims	26164	While civet cats were suspected as intermediate hosts, it took years to confirm.	0
NewsClaims	26165	In neither case was there was a suggestion of a lab leak.	0
NewsClaims	26166	Because of that, the model of transmission via an intermediate host has remained the predominant one under consideration.	0
NewsClaims	26167	Another issue is that a lot of focus of research into the origins of Covid-19 so far has relied on the very specialised field of the interpretation of gene sequences of the virus, an area that is less accessible to non-experts including journalists.	0
NewsClaims	26168	But wasn’t there a World Health Organization mission to Wuhan to study the origins of Covid-19?	0
NewsClaims	26169	There was indeed.	0
NewsClaims	26170	But the terms of reference of that mission, agreed with China, were to study the potential animal origins of the coronavirus, a fact that was well known to the US and other countries.	0
NewsClaims	26171	It did not include provisions for an audit of the WIV laboratory or to look into so-called “gain of function” research at the lab into viruses, which the Chinese are unlikely to have agreed to.	0
NewsClaims	26172	During that mission to Wuhan, researchers spent just three hours at the lab.	0
NewsClaims	26173	However, in public comments team members were sceptical of the lab leak theory after their visit, on the basis of what they were allowed to see – although that does not rule other material having been hidden.	0
NewsClaims	26174	And China, as the WHO’s head, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, made clear, did not provide all the information that many had been hoping for, including full epidemiological data on some 174 early cases.	0
NewsClaims	26175	Why has the lab leak theory come back now?	0
NewsClaims	26176	That’s complicated.	0
NewsClaims	26177	The overt hostility of the Trump administration to China, and the way it pushed the lab leak claims, including a dodgy dossier that was doing the rounds last year, made it a pretty tainted source.	0
NewsClaims	26178	The advent of a Biden administration, which is less hostile to China, combined with the limitations in the WHO investigation, created an environment where some have felt able to ask questions about Covid-19’s origins without appearing to buy into Trump-era conspiracies.	0
NewsClaims	26179	However, like the Benghazi attack in 2012, the Wuhan lab leak theory remains something of a cause celebre for the US right in the midst of what is essentially a cold war between the US and China.	0
NewsClaims	26180	In particular, it has been seen as a stick to beat the Biden administration’s handling of it, not least following the decision to close down a state dDepartment group that had been looking into the lab leak theory.	0
NewsClaims	26181	That effort, first reported by CNN, was quietly launched by the then secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, last autumn and reportedly became quickly mired in concern that it was part of a politicised effort by the Trump administration to blame China and cherry-pick facts to prove a theory.	0
NewsClaims	26182	Indeed, one source quoted by CNN was highly critical of the work being done.	0
NewsClaims	26183	“They basically conducted it in secret, cutting out the state department’s technical experts and the intelligence community, and then trying to brief certain senior officials in the interagency on their ‘tentative conclusions’ even before they’d let the department leaders they worked for know an investigation was under way at all.”	0
NewsClaims	26184	That sounds familiar …	0
NewsClaims	26185	It does indeed.	0
NewsClaims	26186	Many aspects of Wuhan lab leak story have echoes of the search for WMD in the run-up to the Iraq war in 2003 which included efforts to “stove pipe” intelligence analysis to fit the operating theory.	0
NewsClaims	26187	Then as now, experts (then weapons inspectors also under the aegis of a UN body) were sent into a highly obstructive environment amid a highly politicised debate.	0
NewsClaims	26188	Leaks of dubious intelligence – some of it provided by third party countries like the infamous Curveball claims – were reported without sufficient scepticism and expert warnings sidelined.	0
NewsClaims	26189	So has the lab leak theory become more credible or not?	0
NewsClaims	26190	The bottom line is that it is still impossible to know with any certainty, as Biden has said.	0
NewsClaims	26191	Lab accidents do happen all the time, meaning that without further evidence a lab leak remains a possibility.	0
NewsClaims	26192	Chinese obstruction of research into Covid-19’s origins, combined with its own promotion of conspiracy theories over a foreign origin of the disease, make it look like it has something sinister to hide.	0
NewsClaims	26193	As the experience of the Iraq weapons inspectors demonstrated, obstruction can be profoundly misunderstood as suggesting a motive: ie Saddam Hussein was not hiding WMD but had substantially disarmed.	0
NewsClaims	26194	And where we are today, as Adam Taylor put it cleverly in the Washington Post on Thursday, is nowhere close to a resolution.	0
NewsClaims	26195	“Although the resurgent chatter may suggest new clues or proof, the inverse is in fact true.	0
NewsClaims	26196	It is the persistent absence of any convincing evidence either for or against the theory that has prompted calls for more investigation.”	0

NewsClaims	26202	Stories and information can spread like wildfire on social media -- go viral -- especially false information.	0
NewsClaims	26203	WCVB is experiencing that phenomenon first-hand as we find one of our stories in the middle of a growing COVID-19 conspiracy online – a story that has been taken out of context and stamped with inaccurate and misleading headlines.	0
NewsClaims	26204	In the attempt to legitimize those claims, the posts are pointing to a WCVB story from January.	0
NewsClaims	26205	But the claims are not true, and the story never made any of them.	0
NewsClaims	26206	Some of the false claims have been translated into multiple languages and are circulating around the world.	0
NewsClaims	26207	Here are the facts about the story and what we know about the investigation into Dr.	0
NewsClaims	26208	Charles Lieber:	0
NewsClaims	26209	Harvard Department Chairman Arrested	0
NewsClaims	26210	"""The complaint alleges that Dr. Lieber signed a contract with the Chinese University in Wuhan."""	0
NewsClaims	26211	Those words were spoken by Andrew Lelling, U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, on Jan.	0
NewsClaims	26212	28.	0
NewsClaims	26213	They are now being used to fuel the conspiracy and misconceptions.	0
NewsClaims	26214	Lelling was speaking at a news conference regarding the arrest of Dr. Lieber, the chairman of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University.	0
NewsClaims	26215	"Dr. Lieber, of Lexington, Mass., is charged with ""Making false statements to the agency of the United States Government,"" or lying to federal authorities about his ties to China."	0
NewsClaims	26216	According to court documents, Dr. Lieber was the Principal Investigator of the Lieber Research Group at Harvard University.	0
NewsClaims	26217	Since 2008, the group had received more than $15 million in grants from the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense.	0
NewsClaims	26218	However, prosecutors allege that on applications with the NIH and DoD, Dr. Lieber did not disclose that he was being paid a salary of up to $50,000 per month and up to $158,000 per year in living expenses by China's Thousand Talents Plan and the Wuhan University of Technology.	0
NewsClaims	26219	The complaint alleges that Dr. Lieber worked with the University for significant periods between at least 2012 and 2017.	0
NewsClaims	26220	Federal investigators also determined that Dr. Lieber was awarded more than $1.5 million to establish a nanotechnology research lab at WUT.	0
NewsClaims	26221	"""China's Thousand Talents Plan, according to the complaint (is) a Chinese government-run program designed to entice scientists and researchers in the United States to share their research expertise with China,"" Lelling said at that news conference."	0

NewsClaims	26260	The EUvsDisinfo database has been accumulating coronavirus-related disinformation cases for more than two months – it’s time to take a look and see what’s hiding in plain sight.	0
NewsClaims	26261	Comparing the cases on the coronavirus published between January 22 and March 25 with the caseload from this week alone, it appears that the anti-American vibe is still going strong.	0
NewsClaims	26262	The second most common narrative is that the EU is failing to cope with the crisis and is disintegrating as a result, together with the border-free Schengen area.	0
NewsClaims	26263	In particular, this narrative of failure and lack of EU solidarity is trending after the delivery of Russian aid to Italy – we have added 26 new disinformation cases to the database.	0
NewsClaims	26264	The narrative that the virus is being used as a weapon against China and its economy comes in third place with 24 cases.	0
NewsClaims	26265	And in fourth place is the rather creative notion that the whole coronavirus crisis is a secret plan of the global elite, with 17 cases and counting.	0
NewsClaims	26266	Rounding out our top five is a group of messages targeting Ukraine in the context of the coronavirus crisis, with the pro-Kremlin media successfully managing to mix in accusations of Nazism.	0
NewsClaims	26267	Total cases: 13.	0
NewsClaims	26268	Do the most common narratives also mean most engagement?	0
NewsClaims	26269	In order to answer this question, we looked at the 152 cases collected between January 22 and March 25, which have had more time to age on social media and generate likes, shares, and comments.	0
NewsClaims	26270	We derived 442 URLs and analysed them using BuzzSumo.	0
NewsClaims	26271	Then we linked the most popular URLs with cases to see which of the narratives have struck a chord with the public.	0
NewsClaims	26272	Check out the ten most popular disinformation messages below.	0
NewsClaims	26273	If 68,700 likes, shares, and comments across different social media platforms doesn’t seem like much, the 263,902 engagements for all those 152 coronavirus-related disinformation articles looks somewhat more worrying.	0
NewsClaims	26274	Especially since this is a topic where disinformation can bring life-threatening consequences.	0
NewsClaims	26275	But it’s also important to lighten the mood occasionally in these challenging times, and here the pro-Kremlin disinformation machine never fails.	0
NewsClaims	26276	Here were this week’s funniest cases:	0

NewsClaims	26283	Pentagon Study: Flu Shot Raises Risk of Coronavirus by 36% (and Other Supporting Studies)	0
NewsClaims	26284	Setting safety and efficacy of influenza vaccination aside, is Anderson’s claim that the flu shot will help people fight COVID-19 remotely true?	0
NewsClaims	26285	The short answer is no.	0
NewsClaims	26286	In fact, the results of many peer-reviewed, published studies prove that Anderson’s recommendation may have been the worst advice he could have given the public.	0
NewsClaims	26287	“Receiving influenza vaccination may increase the risk of other respiratory viruses, a phenomenon known as “virus interference…’vaccine derived’ virus interference was significantly associated with coronavirus…” Here are the findings:	0
NewsClaims	26288	2020 Pentagon study: Flu vaccines increase risk of coronavirus by 36%	0
NewsClaims	26289	Examining non-influenza viruses specifically, the odds of coronavirus in vaccinated individuals were significantly higher when compared to unvaccinated individuals with an odds ratio (association between an exposure and an outcome) of 1.36.	0
NewsClaims	26290	In other words, the vaccinated were 36% more likely to get coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	26291	Many other studies suggest the increased risk of viral respiratory infections from the flu shot:	0
NewsClaims	26292	2018 CDC Study: Flu shots increase risk of non-flu acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) in children.	0
NewsClaims	26293	This CDC supported study concluded an increased risk of acute respiratory illness (ARI) among children <18 years caused by non-influenza respiratory pathogens post-influenza vaccination compared to unvaccinated children during the same period.	0
NewsClaims	26294	2011 Australian Study: Flu shot doubled risk of non-influenza viral infections and increased flu risk by 73%.	0
NewsClaims	26295	A prospective case-control study in healthy young Australian children found that seasonal flu shots doubled their risk of illness from non-influenza virus infections.	0
NewsClaims	26296	Overall, the vaccine increased the risk of virus-associated acute respiratory illness, including influenza, by 73%.	0
NewsClaims	26297	2012 Hong Kong Study: Flu shots increased the risk of non-flu respiratory infections 4.4 times and tripled flu infections.	0
NewsClaims	26298	A randomized placebo-controlled trial in Hong Kong children found that flu shots increased the risk of non-influenza viral ARIs fivefold (OR 4.91,CI 1.04—8.14) and, including influenza, tripled the overall viral ARI risk (OR 3.17, CI 1.04—9.83).	0
NewsClaims	26299	2017 Study: Vaccinated children are 5.9 more likely to suffer pneumonia and 30.1 times more likely to have been diagnosed with Allergic Rhinitis than unvaccinated children.	0
NewsClaims	26300	Vaccinated children were 30.1 times more likely to have been diagnosed with Allergic Rhinitis and 5.9 times more likely to have been diagnosed with pneumonia than unvaccinated children.	0
NewsClaims	26301	2014 Study: Influenza-vaccinated children were 1.6 times more likely than unvaccinated children to have a non-influenza “Influenza-like-illness” (ILI).	0
NewsClaims	26302	Even more published science	0
NewsClaims	26303	The well-respected Cochrane Collaboration’s comprehensive 2010 meta-analysis of published influenza vaccine studies found that the influenza vaccination has “no effect” on hospitalization, and that there is “no evidence that vaccines prevent viral transmission or complications.” The Cochrane Researchers concluded that the scientific evidence “seem[s] to discourage the utilization of vaccination against influenza in healthy adults as a routine public health measure.”	0
NewsClaims	26304	In their meta-analysis, the Cochrane researchers accused the CDC of deliberately misrepresenting the science in order to support their universal influenza vaccination recommendation.	0
NewsClaims	26305	Nevertheless, CNN and other mainstream media outlets continually broadcast CDC pronouncements as gospel and, ironically, ridicules those of us who actually read the science as “purveyors of ‘vaccine misinformation”.	0

NewsClaims	26354	Scientists have since raised serious concerns about the study's data and analysis, given that few other studies have linked hydroxychloroquine with a high mortality rate.	0
NewsClaims	26355	Today, the journal issued an Expression of Concern, and noted that an independent audit of the data has been commissioned.	0
NewsClaims	26356	But the findings had already prompted health regulators in several countries, and the World Health Organization, to pause enrolment in trials of the drug last week.	0
NewsClaims	26357	The situation with the drug is far from clear-cut.	0
NewsClaims	26358	The	0

NewsClaims	26360	study isn’t the first to document the drug’s adverse effects.	0
NewsClaims	26361	Several randomized and observational studies of the drug published in the past two months have also found adverse effects, including diarrhoea and heart-rhythm abnormalities, while reporting conflicting results about the drug’s efficacy.	0
NewsClaims	26362	Recommendation extended	0
NewsClaims	26363	Despite the lack of clear evidence that the drug is safe or protects people from coronavirus infection, on 22 May an Indian health ministry task force released the advice for front-line workers, including the police and people conducting door-to-door surveys to estimate the COVID-19 burden to take hydroxychloroquine to prevent infection.	0
NewsClaims	26364	The advice expands on a similar recommendation, made in March, in which the task force said that health-care workers caring for people with COVID-19, and household contacts of people with confirmed COVID-19, should also take the drug.	0
NewsClaims	26365	Dozens of coronavirus drugs are in development — what happens next?	0
NewsClaims	26366	Only one of these studies has been published, on 31 May	0
NewsClaims	26367	2	0
NewsClaims	26368	, which compared people with the disease to those without it, known as a case-controlled study.Scientists at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) looked at whether more than 300 health-care workers who had caught the virus were more or less likely to have taken hydroxychloroquine than a similar number of health-care workers who hadn’t caught the virus.	0
NewsClaims	26369	The study found that those who caught the virus were less likely to have taken the drug.	0
NewsClaims	26370	But several scientists say these findings don’t mean much.	0
NewsClaims	26371	Only a randomized controlled trial, in which people are randomly chosen to take the drug or the placebo, and followed up to determine their risk of acquiring the disease, can answer this question, he says.	0
NewsClaims	26372	At best, the study’s findings justify further research, but they aren’t strong enough to support the government’s recommendation, says Sahaj Rathi, a New-Delhi-based transplant hepatologist.	0
NewsClaims	26373	"""I was looking for evidence to justify the advisory, but I don’t see that,"" he says."	0
NewsClaims	26374	Samiran Panda, the director of the ICMR’s National AIDS Research Institute in Pune and the lead author of the study, says the trial was designed to investigate the drug’s public-health relevance, and not to find conclusive evidence of its efficacy.	0
NewsClaims	26375	The head of the ICMR, Balram Bhargava, who is based in New Delhi, has said previously that it would have been unethical to do such a study and deny some people the drug, given that it could be beneficial.	0
NewsClaims	26376	Safety concerns	0
NewsClaims	26377	But a randomized trial is also important to assess a drug’s safety, particularly if a medicine is being recommended to healthy people to prevent infection, rather than to treat a disease, says Rathi.	0
NewsClaims	26378	"""Here we are giving a medicine, which carries a small but known risk of side effects, to healthy people."""	0
NewsClaims	26379	The ICMR says it does have some safety data, from an unpublished observational study of 1,323 health-care workers who took the drug prophylactically.	0
NewsClaims	26380	The agency reports that 1.7% of people experienced hypoglycaemia and 1.9% had cardiovascular effects.	0
NewsClaims	26381	"It concludes that the drug is ""relatively safe""."	0
NewsClaims	26382	How countries are using genomics to help avoid a second coronavirus wave	0
NewsClaims	26383	But scientists question this assessment.	0
NewsClaims	26384	A roughly 2% rate of cardiovascular side effects or hypoglycaemia is high for a drug when there is a lack of rigorous evidence that it works, says Shriprakash Kalantri, an internal-medicine specialist at the Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences in the Indian state of Maharashtra.	0
NewsClaims	26385	Bhargava told	0
NewsClaims	26386	Nature	0
NewsClaims	26387	that the task force behind the government’s latest advisory did consider the drug’s side effects.	0
NewsClaims	26388	The government recommends that people taking hydroxychloroquine get an electrocardiogram at some point during the weeks-long drug regimen to check for any heart-rhythm abnormalities.	0
NewsClaims	26389	Big consequences	0
NewsClaims	26390	Doctors worry that the government’s latest advice will create an overly optimistic perception of the drug, given the environment of panic surrounding the virus.	0
NewsClaims	26391	When the ICMR started recommending the drug in March, doctors warned that this would trigger indiscriminate hydroxychloroquine use.	0
NewsClaims	26392	Those concerns have largely been borne out.	0
NewsClaims	26393	In Mumbai, health authorities initially prescribed the drug to children, contrary to the ICMR’s advice, and considered a plan to give the drug to people under 55 years old in COVID-19 hotspots, such as Mumbai’s Dharavi — one of Asia’s most densely populated slums.	0
NewsClaims	26394	This plan was later shelved, but state authorities continue to give the drug to household contacts of confirmed patients.	0
NewsClaims	26395	Yogesh Jain, a Chhattisgarh-based public-health expert, says he is especially concerned about the use of a potentially ineffective drug among poor people without sufficient monitoring.	0
NewsClaims	26396	"""You are just heaping misery on more people by adding them to an advisory which was not based on any scientific foundation,"" says Jain."	0
NewsClaims	26397	Should pets be tested for coronavirus?	0
NewsClaims	26398	A dog wearing a mask in Shanghai	0
NewsClaims	26399	Science’s COVID-19 reporting is supported by the Pulitzer Center.	0
NewsClaims	26400	Last Thursday, the first cat tested positive for the new coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	26401	The feline had diarrhea, vomiting, and difficulty breathing, and it had come down with COVID-19 about 1 week after its owner did, Belgian health officials announced.	0
NewsClaims	26402	Yet despite these cases—and a third dog that tested positive for coronavirus in Hong Kong earlier this month—the number of pets diagnosed with COVID-19 pales in comparison with the human total, now estimated to be more than 800,000.	0
NewsClaims	26403	And experts, including those at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), continue to emphasize that dogs and cats pose little risk to people.	0
NewsClaims	26404	Still, veterinarians want more information.	0
NewsClaims	26405	Though human tests might work on animals, they are in short supply—and veterinarians prefer species-specific tests, anyway.	0
NewsClaims	26406	Several labs have developed a SARS-CoV-2 test for pets, but none has begun to broadly administer it.	0
NewsClaims	26407	WADDL created its test at the request of local and federal animal health agencies.	0
NewsClaims	26408	Officials were concerned because a nursing home in Kirkland, Washington—site of one of the first U.S. cluster outbreaks of COVID-19 in early March—was also home to a number of residents’ cats.	0
NewsClaims	26409	Dogs and cats share many of the same cell receptors we do—which viruses can bind to—and during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (a coronavirus relative of SARS-CoV-2), scientists reported that cats could become infected with the virus and pass it on to other felines.	0
NewsClaims	26410	WADDL’s SARS-CoV-2 pet test is similar to the human test: It uses the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify RNA from the virus.	0
NewsClaims	26411	Baszler says his team developed it with dozens of archived samples of nasal and throat swabs from cats and dogs collected from the western United States, some of which were seeded with SARS-CoV-2.	0
NewsClaims	26412	Though none of these animals had COVID-19, the test was able to pick up the virus in the seeded samples, while not reporting false positives for other coronaviruses.	0
NewsClaims	26413	Baszler says the World Health Organization has approved the diagnostic and that WADDL could start to test up to 100 pets per day, if needed.	0
NewsClaims	26414	IDEXX Laboratories, a global network of more than 80 diagnostic labs, also announced a SARS-CoV-2 test for animals in mid-March.	0
NewsClaims	26415	Like the WADDL test, it’s based on PCR and was developed using samples from cats and dogs.	0
NewsClaims	26416	(In IDEXX’s case, test development used horse samples, too.)	0
NewsClaims	26417	The company has analyzed more than 4000 samples, including specimens from animals with respiratory disorders.	0
NewsClaims	26418	"""All have come back negative,"" says Jim Blacka, the company’s senior director."	0
NewsClaims	26419	"""If there is a need to start testing pets, we’re ready to commercialize it and make it widely available."""	0
NewsClaims	26420	But there are roadblocks to implementing either test.	0
NewsClaims	26421	The first issue is a lack of urgency.	0
NewsClaims	26422	"""Yet nobody is reporting a spike"" in respiratory infections in cats and dogs."	0
NewsClaims	26423	Even the three pets that have tested positive for the virus shouldn’t sound an alarm, says Jonathan Epstein, vice president for science and outreach at the EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit that tracks emerging diseases in animals.	0
NewsClaims	26424	"""Detecting RNA is different from [animals] shedding infectious virus,"" he says."	0
NewsClaims	26425	USDA released an FAQ last week that cautioned against pet testing.	0
NewsClaims	26426	"""At this time, testing for companion animals will only be done if animal and public health officials agree testing should occur due to a link to a known human case of COVID-19,"" it reads."	0
NewsClaims	26427	"""We will not be testing the general companion animal population."""	0
NewsClaims	26428	The document, Rankin argues, effectively prevents labs from broadly testing companion animals for SARS-CoV-2 without USDA approval.	0
NewsClaims	26429	Baszler says the recommendations are helpful, because it’s unclear what to do if a pet tests positive for the virus.	0
NewsClaims	26430	"""If you get a positive dog in a home where no one else is sick, what do you do with that animal?"""	0
NewsClaims	26431	he asks.	0
NewsClaims	26432	"""Do you quarantine it?"	0
NewsClaims	26433	Where?	0
NewsClaims	26434	"And who decides when that quarantine gets lifted?"""	0
NewsClaims	26435	"Rushing into testing without a road map, he says, ""just creates angst and fear."""	0
NewsClaims	26436	Baszler says he is working with state veterinary officials to develop such a plan for pet testing.	0
NewsClaims	26437	He says if the efforts do begin, the first focus should be on animals in homes in which humans have already tested positive.	0
NewsClaims	26438	If those animals were positive, too, veterinarians could study them to learn more about how the virus affects cats and dogs.	0
NewsClaims	26439	"If animals do spread the virus, he says, ""You’d want to take extra precautions if you have elderly relatives visiting, or if you’re bringing dogs to nursing homes as emotional support animals."""	0
NewsClaims	26440	For now, Behravesh recommends treating our pets like we now treat ourselves.	0
NewsClaims	26441	"""If you’re sick, restrict your access to your pet as much as you can,"" she says."	0
NewsClaims	26442	Don’t pet other people’s dogs.	0
NewsClaims	26443	"Always wash your hands,"" she says."	0
NewsClaims	26444	"""It’s really important that people don’t panic."""	0
NewsClaims	26445	Epstein agrees.	0

NewsClaims	26450	GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization played down media reports on Wednesday of “breakthrough” drugs being discovered to treat people infected with the new coronavirus, which is causing an epidemic in China and has spread to at least 20 other countries.	0
NewsClaims	26451	A Chinese TV report said researchers at Zhejiang University had found an effective drug for the virus, while Britain’s Sky News said researchers had made a “significant breakthrough” in developing a vaccine.	0
NewsClaims	26452	Oil prices jumped on the reports.	0
NewsClaims	26453	[O/R]	0
NewsClaims	26454	The process of developing and testing drugs or vaccines against a new pathogen normally takes many years and is often fraught with pitfalls and failures.	0
NewsClaims	26455	Even at the accelerated pace enabled by new technologies, the earliest that scientists hope to be able to start initial human trials of a new coronavirus vaccine is by June this year.	0
NewsClaims	26456	Doctors looking for ways to treat patients infected with the new coronavirus are likely to try antiviral medicines licensed for use against other viral infections to see if they might help, as well as potential antiviral drugs still in development.	0
NewsClaims	26457	“It is not approved anywhere globally,” a Gilead spokesman told Reuters in Beijing.	0
NewsClaims	26458	Gilead said it had increased manufacturing of remdesivir to create a stockpile that might be used in future viral disease outbreaks.	0

NewsClaims	26471	Overview	0
NewsClaims	26472	On 30 January 2020, the BBC reported on the growing number of conspiracy theories and bad health advice regarding COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	26473	Notable examples at the time included false health advice shared on social media and private chats, as well as conspiracy theories such as the disease's origins in (Chinese) bat soup and the outbreak being planned with the participation of the Pirbright Institute.	0
NewsClaims	26474	[6][7] On 31 January, The Guardian listed seven instances of misinformation, adding the conspiracy theories about bioweapons and the link to 5G technology, and including varied false health advice.	0
NewsClaims	26475	[8]	0
NewsClaims	26476	In an attempt to speed up research sharing, many researchers have turned to preprint servers such as arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, and SSRN.	0
NewsClaims	26477	Papers are uploaded to these servers without peer review or any other editorial process that ensures research quality.	0
NewsClaims	26478	Some of these papers have contributed to the spread of conspiracy theories.	0
NewsClaims	26479	"The most notable case was an unreviewed preprint paper uploaded to bioRxiv which claimed that the virus contained HIV ""insertions""."	0
NewsClaims	26480	Following objections, the paper was withdrawn.	0
NewsClaims	26481	[9][10][11] Preprints about COVID-19 have been extensively shared online and some data suggest that they have been used by the media almost 10 times more than preprints on other topics.	0
NewsClaims	26482	[12]	0
NewsClaims	26483	"According to a study published by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, most misinformation related to COVID-19 involves ""various forms of reconfiguration, where existing and often true information is spun, twisted, recontextualised, or reworked""; less misinformation ""was completely fabricated""."	0
NewsClaims	26484	"The study also found that ""top-down misinformation from politicians, celebrities, and other prominent public figures"", while accounting for a minority of the samples, captured a majority of the social media engagement."	0
NewsClaims	26485	"According to their classification, the largest category of misinformation (39%) was ""misleading or false claims about the actions or policies of public authorities, including government and international bodies like the WHO or the UN""."	0
NewsClaims	26486	[13]	0
NewsClaims	26487	A natural experiment—an experiment that takes place spontaneously, without human design or intervention—shows a potential link between coronavirus misinformation and increased infection and death.	0
NewsClaims	26488	There was one instance of this reported where two similar television news shown on the same network were compared.	0
NewsClaims	26489	One reported the effects of coronavirus more seriously and about a month earlier than the other.	0
NewsClaims	26490	People and groups exposed to the news show reporting the effects later had higher infection and death rates.	0
NewsClaims	26491	[14]	0
NewsClaims	26492	Misinformation on this subject has been used by politicians, interest groups, and state actors in many countries for political purposes: to avoid responsibility, scapegoat other countries, and avoid criticism of their earlier decisions.	0
NewsClaims	26493	Sometimes there is a financial motive as well.	0
NewsClaims	26494	[15][16][17] A number of countries have been accused of spreading disinformation with state-backed operations in the social media in other countries to generate panic, sow distrust, and undermine democratic debate in other countries, or to promote their models of government.	0
NewsClaims	26495	[18][19][20][21]	0

NewsClaims	26506	One early source of the bio-weapon origin was former Israeli secret service officer Dany Shoham, who gave an interview to The Washington Times about the Wuhan laboratory.	0
NewsClaims	26507	"[31][32] The Epoch Times, a newspaper affiliated with Falun Gong, refers to the SARS-CoV-2 virus as the ""CCP virus"", and a commentary in the newspaper posed the question, ""is the novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan an accident occasioned by weaponizing the virus at that [Wuhan P4 virology] lab?"	0

NewsClaims	26522	"Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada said that this had ""no factual basis""."	0
NewsClaims	26523	[50] The stories seem to have been derived[51] from a July 2019 news article[52] stating that some Chinese researchers had their security access to the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, a Level 4 virology lab, revoked after a Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigation.	0
NewsClaims	26524	Canadian officials described this as an administrative matter and said there was no risk to the Canadian public.	0

NewsClaims	26527	"[51] Responding to the conspiracy theories, the CBC stated that ""CBC reporting never claimed the two scientists were spies, or that they brought any version of the coronavirus to the lab in Wuhan""."	0
NewsClaims	26528	While pathogen samples were transferred from the lab in Winnipeg to Beijing on 31 March 2019, neither of the samples was a coronavirus, the Public Health Agency of Canada says the shipment conformed to all federal policies, and there has not been any statement that the researchers under investigation were responsible for sending the shipment.	0

NewsClaims	26666	The study incorrectly suggested that there were no excess deaths due to COVID-19 in the US without taking into account the total excess mortality from all causes reported during the pandemic, with 300,000 being associated to it per CDC data.	0
NewsClaims	26667	Deaths per age group were also shown as a proportion percentage rather than in raw numbers under the erroneous presumption that they would reflect the effects of the pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	26668	In addition, the study observed a reduction in deaths from other causes and suggested that deaths due to heart and respiratory diseases could be being incorrectly categorized as deaths due to COVID-19, failing to take into account that those with such conditions are more vulnerable to the virus and therefore more likely to die from it.	0

NewsClaims	26674	[156] A factcheck.org article on the issue reported that while 6% of the death certificates included COVID-19 exclusively as the cause of death and 94% had additional conditions that contributed to it, COVID-19 was listed as the underlying cause of death in 92% of them, as it may directly cause other severe conditions such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.	0
NewsClaims	26675	[157] In mid-October 2020, the number of deaths from COVID-19 in the United States was reported at 218,511 (CDC), 219,681 (Johns Hopkins University) and 219,541 (The New York Times).	0

NewsClaims	26717	On 24 January 2020, a video circulated online appearing to be of a nurse named Jin Hui[173] in Hubei, describing a far more dire situation in Wuhan than reported by Chinese officials.	0
NewsClaims	26718	The video claimed that more than 90,000 people had been infected with the virus in China, that the virus could spread from one person to 14 people (R 0 =14) and that the virus was starting a second mutation.	0
NewsClaims	26719	[174] The video attracted millions of views on various social media platforms and was mentioned in numerous online reports.	0
NewsClaims	26720	However, the BBC said that, contrary to its English subtitles in one of the video's existing versions, the woman does not claim to be either a nurse or a doctor in the video and that her suit and mask do not match the ones worn by medical staff in Hubei.	0

NewsClaims	26728	Casedemic	0
NewsClaims	26729	COVID-19 deniers use the word casedemic as a shorthand for a conspiracy theory holding that COVID-19 is harmless and that the reported disease figures are merely a result of increased testing.	0
NewsClaims	26730	The concept is particularly attractive to anti-vaccination activists, who use it to argue that public health measures, and particularly vaccines, are not needed to counter what they say is a fake epidemic.	0

NewsClaims	26733	[177]	0
NewsClaims	26734	The term has been adopted by alternative medicine advocate Joseph Mercola, who has exaggerated the effect of false positives in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to construct a false narrative that testing is invalid because it is not perfectly accurate.	0
NewsClaims	26735	In reality, the problems with PCR testing are well-known and accounted for by public health authorities.	0
NewsClaims	26736	Such claims also disregard the possibility of asymptomatic spread, the number of potentially-undetected cases during the initial phases of the pandemic in comparison to the present due to increased testing and knowledge since, and other variables that can influence PCR tests.	0

NewsClaims	26854	[249][250][251] The study also only looked at one wearer wearing the one neck gaiter made from a polyester/spandex blend, which is not sufficient evidence to support the claim about gaiters made in the media.	0
NewsClaims	26855	"[250] The study found that the neck gaiter, which was made from a thin and stretchy material, appeared to be ineffective at limiting airborne droplets expelled from the wearer; Isaac Henrion, one of the co-authors, suggests that the result was likely due to the material rather than the style, stating that ""Any mask made from that fabric would probably have the same result, no matter the design."	0

NewsClaims	26939	mRNA in the cytosol is very rapidly degraded before it would have time to gain entry into the cell nucleus.	0
NewsClaims	26940	(mRNA vaccines must be stored at very low temperature to prevent mRNA degradation.)	0
NewsClaims	26941	Retrovirus can be single-stranded RNA (just as SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is single-stranded RNA) which enters the cell nucleus and uses reverse transcriptase to make DNA from the RNA in the cell nucleus.	0
NewsClaims	26942	A retrovirus has mechanisms to be imported into the nucleus, but other mRNA lack these mechanisms.	0
NewsClaims	26943	Once inside the nucleus, creation of DNA from RNA cannot occur without a primer, which accompanies a retrovirus, but which would not exist for other mRNA if placed in the nucleus.	0
NewsClaims	26944	[304][305] Thus, mRNA vaccines cannot alter DNA because they cannot enter the nucleus, and because they have no primer to activate reverse transcriptase.	0

NewsClaims	27244	The intelligence remains secret.	0
NewsClaims	27245	But what we know is that before she was removed, she sent one of the deadliest viruses on Earth, and multiple varieties of it to maximize the genetic diversity and maximize what experimenters in China could do with it, to a laboratory in China that does dangerous gain of function experiments.	0

NewsClaims	27337	- New data show therapy reduced risk of hospitalizations and death by 87 percent - Second positive Phase 3 trial readout for bamlanivimab and etesevimab together - Results support use of bamlanivimab 700 mg and etesevimab 1400 mg, the dose authorized in U.S. and several countries around the world	0
NewsClaims	27338	These results provide additional efficacy and safety data that support the use of the dose recently granted both Emergency Use Authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a positive scientific opinion by the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP).	0
NewsClaims	27339	This new Phase 3 cohort of BLAZE-1 included 769 high-risk patients, aged 12 and older with mild to moderate COVID-19 (therapy: n=511; placebo: n=258).	0
NewsClaims	27340	There were four events in patients taking bamlanivimab with etesevimab and 15 events in patients taking placebo, representing an 87 percent risk reduction (p0.0001).	0
NewsClaims	27341	Bamlanivimab and etesevimab together also demonstrated statistically significant improvements on key secondary endpoints.	0
NewsClaims	27342	These results are consistent with those seen in other data sets from BLAZE-1: in the previous Phase 3 cohort, bamlanivimab 2800 mg with etesevimab 2800 mg reduced the risk of hospitalizations and deaths by 70 percent and in the Phase 2 cohort, bamlanivimab alone reduced the risk of hospitalizations and ER visits by approximately 70 percent.	0
NewsClaims	27343	The viral load reductions were also consistent with what was observed in the previous Phase 3 cohort of the study.	0
NewsClaims	27344	In this new Phase 3 cohort, there were four deaths total, all of which were deemed related to COVID-19 and all of which occurred in patients taking placebo; no deaths occurred in patients receiving treatment with bamlanivimab and etesevimab together.	0
NewsClaims	27345	Across the two Phase 3 cohorts of the study that have been analyzed to date, there have been no deaths in patients receiving treatment with bamlanivimab and etesevimab together, and 14 deaths in patients receiving placebo, 13 of which were deemed COVID-19 related.	0
NewsClaims	27346	In this data set, the safety profile of bamlanivimab and etesevimab together was consistent with observations from other Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials evaluating these antibodies.	0

NewsClaims	27459	Joe Biden received his first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on live US television on Monday afternoon, in keeping with public officials’ efforts to show Americans such vaccines are safe.	0
NewsClaims	27460	Shortly after 3.20pm, Biden appeared before cameras at a medical facility.	0
NewsClaims	27461	He rolled up his sleeve and said: “I’m ready.” After the jab, Biden thanked scientists and medical workers, saying their efforts were “just amazing”.	0
NewsClaims	27462	He also praised the White House, saying “I think that the administration deserves some credit getting this off the ground” and that the vaccine provides “great hope”.	0
NewsClaims	27463	“There’s nothing to worry about,” Biden also said of receiving the vaccine.	0
NewsClaims	27464	He said that his wife, Jill Biden, had already received her first dose earlier in the day.	0
NewsClaims	27465	Covid-19 has killed at least 317,684 people in the US and infected nearly 17.9 million, according to Johns Hopkins University data.	0
NewsClaims	27466	The same source recorded 189,099 new cases on Sunday and 1,509 deaths, both figures down on record highs last week but for weekend days, when numbers usually drop.	0
NewsClaims	27467	The Covid Tracking Project said 113,633 people were hospitalized, another small drop.	0
NewsClaims	27468	Hospital and intensive care capacity is under intense strain.	0
NewsClaims	27469	The first shots of the Moderna vaccine, which like the Pfizer-BioNTech shot requires two doses but which is easier to store, were packed and shipped from Tennessee on Sunday.	0
NewsClaims	27470	“I don’t want to get ahead of the line, but I want to make sure we demonstrate to the American people that it is safe to take,” the president-elect said.	0
NewsClaims	27471	Top US politicians – including Mike Pence, the vice-president, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House speaker, and Mitch McConnell, Republican Senate majority leader – received doses on Friday, putting them among the first Americans to receive injections.	0
NewsClaims	27472	By publicizing their injections, and showing no adverse reactions, they hope to stem a rising tide of skepticism about vaccine safety and efficacy.	0
NewsClaims	27473	Kamala Harris, the vice-president elect, and her husband are poised to get their first doses next week.	0
NewsClaims	27474	Such efforts to show the inoculations are safe are increasingly important, given recent data on American attitudes toward Covid-19 vaccines.	0
NewsClaims	27475	While half of Americans said they would take the vaccine, according to a recent poll, one-quarter of adults said they would not, while another quarter said they weren’t sure.	0
NewsClaims	27476	Experts have said that “herd immunity” – when the overall population is largely immune because a significant portion of it is – will be seen when 60% to 70% reach some level of immunity.	0
NewsClaims	27477	Notably absent from these public campaigns is Donald Trump.	0
NewsClaims	27478	He has mostly remained out of the public eye while continuing to fume over his loss to Biden – and weighing increasingly long-shot attempts to hold on to power.	0
NewsClaims	27479	Trump, who has expressed misinformation about vaccine safety, has not disclosed when he will get his first dose.	0
NewsClaims	27480	Earlier in December, Trump said on Twitter that he was “not scheduled” to receive it, but was looking “forward to doing so at the appropriate time”.	0
NewsClaims	27481	White House officials have claimed that Trump is speaking with his doctors about timing.	0
NewsClaims	27482	In October, Trump was hospitalized with coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	27483	The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stated that people who received such treatment should not receive the vaccine for a minimum of 90 days, to prevent any possible interference.	0
NewsClaims	27484	“When the time is right, I’m sure he will remain willing to take it,” a White House spokesman, Brian Morgenstern, said on Friday.	0
NewsClaims	27485	“It’s just something we’re working through.”	0
NewsClaims	27486	Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, gave a different explanation, telling reporters part of Trump’s decision to wait was “to show Americans that our priority are the most vulnerable.	0
NewsClaims	27487	01:06 'Santa Claus is good to go': Dr Fauci says he vaccinated Father Christmas – video	0
NewsClaims	27488	“The president wants to send a parallel message, which is, you know, our long-term care facility residents and our frontline workers are paramount in importance, and he wants to set an example in that regard.”	0
NewsClaims	27489	This position is at odds with other experts including Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious diseases expert.	0
NewsClaims	27490	“Even though the president himself was infected, and he has, likely, antibodies that likely would be protective, we’re not sure how long that protection lasts.	0
NewsClaims	27491	So, to be doubly sure, I would recommend that he get vaccinated,” Fauci told ABC.	0
NewsClaims	27492	“We know that infection doesn’t induce a very strong immune response and it wanes over time,” he said.	0
NewsClaims	27493	“So I think, as a clear precaution, it is appropriate to be vaccinated because it’s safe.	0
NewsClaims	27494	I think people should be vaccinated, indeed.”	0
NewsClaims	27495	On March 10, 2020, Now8News published an article positing that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that COVID-19, a disease caused by the new coronavirus, had been found in packages of toilet paper, and that people should start using a wet washcloth to clean themselves instead:	0
NewsClaims	27496	COVID-19 Found in Toilet Paper […] The coronavirus has been found in the one place people never expected, toilet paper.	0
NewsClaims	27497	Testing by Washington State Health department confirmed the COVID-19 virus particles were present in the samples they took from five separate packages of toilet paper from Big Box stores.	0
NewsClaims	27498	Now8News is a junk news site that traffics in misinformation.	0
NewsClaims	27499	Now8News does not carry a readily available disclaimer labeling its content as “satire” or “fake news,” but this website’s content is undoubtedly fiction.	0
NewsClaims	27500	We’ve been debunking misinformation from Now8News since at least 2015, including junk news articles about people having sex with pigs at Walmart, a cannibal eating a person at a haunted house in Texas, and a lottery winner who died after dipping his testicles in gold.	0
NewsClaims	27501	Those unfamiliar with this site, however, were given no indications that this toilet-paper story was false.	0
NewsClaims	27502	It was presented like a traditional news story and even includes fabricated quotes from the CDC.	0
NewsClaims	27503	Now 8 News writes:	0
NewsClaims	27504	The CDC is urging people to using a wet washcloth when cleaning themselves after using the bathroom instead of toilet paper.	0
NewsClaims	27505	“Use a washcloth to clean yourself after you go to the bathroom, it’s not a big deal, that’s what we did back in the old days,” said Peter Lendl, who headed the investigation of the contaminated toilet paper.	0
NewsClaims	27506	“Just know which one is yours.”	0
NewsClaims	27507	This is not a genuine quote from the CDC.	0

NewsClaims	27511	Airborne Transmission of Coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	27512	Airborne Transmission in Tight Spaces	0
NewsClaims	27513	This is important news.	0
NewsClaims	27514	Unlike these heavier droplets, airborne diseases can be picked up in airstreams, can travel farther than heavier droplets, and require different prevention strategies.	0
NewsClaims	27515	For the sake of comparison and understanding, heavier droplets are like a bowling ball and smaller airborne droplets are like a ping-pong ball.	0
NewsClaims	27516	The wind or airstream is going to have a greater impact on redirecting a ping-pong ball than it is a bowling ball.	0
NewsClaims	27517	Subsequently, airborne droplets can be caught up in the airstream and recirculated throughout a poorly ventilated building.	0
NewsClaims	27518	This recent development has fast-tracked the recent requirement for wearing masks while indoors.	0
NewsClaims	27519	A New York Times model shows how these droplets can spread from you to others around you.	0
NewsClaims	27520	Loud and Crammed Indoor Spaces	0
NewsClaims	27521	Loud and crammed indoor spaces like bars are also more vulnerable to airborne transmission.	0
NewsClaims	27522	People are congregating in tight spaces and because of the noise levels; they have to talk louder thus expelling droplets more rapidly and forcefully.	0
NewsClaims	27523	The same thing can be said about weddings, church services, birthday parties, and funerals.	0
NewsClaims	27524	These settings usually have people talking, singing, laughing, and crying in small indoor spaces leading to a higher chance of transmission and infection.	0
NewsClaims	27525	Many of these same principles extend to office spaces, schools, healthcare settings, and other indoor places with large gatherings that require face-to-face communication.	0
NewsClaims	27526	For safe social gatherings, health professionals recommend heading outdoors.	0
NewsClaims	27527	Despite the infinite amount of ventilation provided by the outdoors, droplets can still start concentrating after a long enough time of talking, laughing, etc.	0
NewsClaims	27528	increasing the possibility of infection.	0
NewsClaims	27529	For this, health professionals recommend staying distanced, moving, limiting guests, and wearing a mask.	0
NewsClaims	27530	If you are not staying in the same spot, like moving through a grocery store or walking, then your rate of infection decreases.	0
NewsClaims	27531	As of the publication of this blog, doctors have not specified a dosage rate required for infection.	0
NewsClaims	27532	Asymptomatic Superspreaders	0
NewsClaims	27533	Doctors are also still exploring the differences between super-spreaders and less efficient spreaders.	0
NewsClaims	27534	Superspreaders can rapidly spread coronavirus to others even if they are asymptomatic.	0
NewsClaims	27535	To help deter infections by asymptomatic superspreaders, cities and states are implementing mask mandates for indoor spaces since they help filter out larger droplets and can reduce spread.	0
NewsClaims	27536	Many major retailers like Target, Walmart, Kroger, and Aldi are also requiring masks in stores, even if the local government has not mandated it.	0
NewsClaims	27537	Many other retailers have erected Plexiglas barriers between shoppers and workers.	0
NewsClaims	27538	Check with your local store to see their current mandates.	0
NewsClaims	27539	Using these filters in conjunction with an air purifier, helps you quickly change out the air.	0
NewsClaims	27540	This process helps reduce the spread of airborne viruses.	0
NewsClaims	27541	Experts are also still trying to determine how long the virus lives on surfaces.	0
NewsClaims	27542	This determines the risk involved in changing out those virus-filled air filters.	0
NewsClaims	27543	Protecting yourself against COVID-19 and other airborne viruses require a multi-part approach.	0
NewsClaims	27544	Healthy Air System™	0
NewsClaims	27545	Aprilaire also offers a multi-part approach to indoor air quality in your home.	0
NewsClaims	27546	This approach helps protect against airborne viruses and other airborne pollutants like mold, mildew, dander, and odors.	0
NewsClaims	27547	Along with air filtration, we recommend humidity control and fresh air ventilation to best attack those indoor air quality issues as part of our Healthy Air System™.	0
NewsClaims	27548	This suite of solutions uses humidity control to impact those airborne pollutants’ living environment.	0
NewsClaims	27549	Air filtration and fresh air ventilation combine to capture airborne pollutants and bring in fresh air to reduce the proliferation of airborne viruses.	0
NewsClaims	27550	Medical professionals are still learning more about this novel virus.	0
NewsClaims	27551	Until there is a vaccine, it is best to take as many precautions to protect yourself and your family.	0
NewsClaims	27552	You can help protect yourself by wearing a mask, social distancing, and washing hands and surfaces frequently.	0
NewsClaims	27553	This virus has a mortality rate of around 3 to 4 percent and for those that have recovered; it can have long-lasting health impacts as it attacks your heart and brain.	0

NewsClaims	27604	According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , “There is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.”	0
NewsClaims	27605	Scientists are debating the importance of these cases in animals.	0
NewsClaims	27606	For instance, Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, in the United Kingdom, says:	0
NewsClaims	27607	“We have to differentiate between real infection and just detecting the presence of the virus.	0

NewsClaims	27610	Face masks always protect against the coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	27611	Healthcare workers use professional face masks that fit tightly to protect themselves from infections.	0
NewsClaims	27612	Disposable and cloth masks can protect against droplets, but neither can protect against aerosolized particles.	0
NewsClaims	27613	The CDC recommend that all people wear cloth face masks in public areas where it is difficult to maintain a 6-foot, or 2-meter, distance from others.	0
NewsClaims	27614	This helps slow the spread of the virus.	0
NewsClaims	27615	Even while wearing a mask, it is essential to continue with other precautions, such as not touching the face, physical distancing, and washing the hands frequently.	0

NewsClaims	27702	As the world becomes more connected, some regions are rolling out 5G mobile technology.	0
NewsClaims	27703	This has prompted a raft of conspiracy theories.	0
NewsClaims	27704	One of the most recent to emerge is that 5G is responsible for the swift spread of SARS-CoV-2 across the globe.	0
NewsClaims	27705	This is a myth.	0
NewsClaims	27706	Some people believe that 5G helps viruses communicate, often citing a paper from 2011.	0

NewsClaims	27740	Such documentation would, in theory, allow people who have had a COVID-19 vaccine to move freely once again.	0
NewsClaims	27741	However, at present there is not enough evidence to prove whether or not thecurrently authorized vaccinesstop the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.	0
NewsClaims	27742	The trial results for the Pfizer-BioNTech , Moderna-NIAID , and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines so far suggest they are effective in preventing symptoms of COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	27743	However, research on whether or not these vaccines and other vaccine candidates are also likely to prevent transmission is lacking.	0
NewsClaims	27744	Russian biologist Igor Nikulin, who was presented as a former member of the U.N.

NewsClaims	27780	But not everyone agrees with that hypothesis.	0
NewsClaims	27781	"One expert told Live Science that ""there are a lot of weaknesses"" in the study and that the data don't support the study's conclusions."	0
NewsClaims	27782	Evolution of a virus	0
NewsClaims	27783	Before the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 made the jump to humans, two other coronaviruses , SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, evolved in bats and passed through other animals on their way to people.	0
NewsClaims	27784	SARS-CoV passed through civets and MERS-CoV through camels, and the molecular structure of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that the virus also passed through an intermediate animal , but scientists don't yet know which one.	0
NewsClaims	27785	In February, authors of a preliminary study published to the preprint database bioRxiv suggested that pangolins may bridge the gap between bats and humans, since SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses that infect pangolins sport similar spike proteins — a structure on the surface of the virus that allows it to infect cells.	0
NewsClaims	27786	But other scientists argued that, despite their spike proteins, pangolin coronaviruses bear many differences to SARS-CoV-2 that make pangolins unlikely to be the source of infection, The New York Times reported .	0
NewsClaims	27787	With the mystery unresolved, biology professor Xuhua Xia of the University of Ottawa in Canada launched his own investigation into how the coronavirus passed from bats to people.	0
NewsClaims	27788	His analysis, published April 14 in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution , offered a new solution: dogs.	0
NewsClaims	27789	Xia reached his conclusion by scanning the genetic code of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses for a specific feature known as a CpG site, a sequence of genetic code in which the compound cytosine (C) is followed by the compound guanine (G).	0
NewsClaims	27790	The human immune system sees CpG sites as a red flag, signaling that an invasive virus is present.	0
NewsClaims	27791	A human protein called zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) latches onto the CpG sites on the viral genetic code and recruits help to break down the pathogen, according to UniProt , an online protein database.	0
NewsClaims	27792	The theory follows that, the fewer CpG sites, the less vulnerable a virus will be to ZAP.	0
NewsClaims	27793	Related: 10 deadly diseases that hopped across species	0
NewsClaims	27794	Xia found that SARS-CoV-2 carries fewer CpG sites than the other known coronaviruses that first evolved in animals, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.	0
NewsClaims	27795	In addition, the closest known relative of SARS-CoV-2 , the bat coronavirus RaTG13, contains fewer CpG sites than related bat coronaviruses , according to the analysis.	0
NewsClaims	27796	Essentially, in order to survive and reproduce, a pathogen like SARS-CoV-2 needs to be able to evade the host’s immune fighters, and in this case it would mean getting rid of CpG sites that could alert ZAP proteins to the virus.	0
NewsClaims	27797	From the intestines of dogs?	0
NewsClaims	27798	Unfortunately, little data exists on exactly how much ZAP appears in different animal tissues, Xia told Live Science.	0
NewsClaims	27799	So he worked backwards, looking for animal coronaviruses with low CpG levels.	0
NewsClaims	27800	He found a coronavirus that primarily infects the canine intestine, and thus inferred that the dog gut might contain adequate ZAP levels to drive viral evolution in this way.	0
NewsClaims	27801	"""Only canids seem to have the tissue generating low-CpG CoVs during my study,"" Xia said."	0
NewsClaims	27802	"If a precursor to SARS-CoV-2 breached the canine intestine, then this would have ""resulted in rapid evolution of the virus"" to lose CpG sites and become better equipped to infect humans, he wrote in the paper."	0
NewsClaims	27803	Beyond the low CpG levels, the paper did not note other genetic similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and the dog coronavirus, but suggested that the canine gut might provide the right environment for such viruses to evolve.	0
NewsClaims	27804	But why the dog intestine?	0
NewsClaims	27805	Some research suggests that ZAP mRNA, which contains instructions to build the protein, appears in both the dog lung and colon but that higher concentrations accumulate in the lungs, Xia said.	0
NewsClaims	27806	It may be that a glut of ZAP in the lungs guards the organ from coronaviruses, while the lower concentrations of ZAP in the colon leave the gut open to severe infection, though there are reasons to be cautious in coming to this conclusion, Xia said.	0
NewsClaims	27807	But does this hypothesis make sense?	0
NewsClaims	27808	"""I think the data do not support these conclusions,"" Pleuni Pennings, an assistant professor of ecology and evolution at San Francisco State University, who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email."	0
NewsClaims	27809	Pennings, whose research group has examined the CpG levels of many viruses, pointed out several weaknesses in the study's logic.	0
NewsClaims	27810	Inconclusive evidence	0
NewsClaims	27811	In a 2018 study published in the journal PLOS Genetics , Pennings surveyed CpG levels in the HIV virus and investigated how the pathogen evolves within individual people.	0
NewsClaims	27812	She then led a similar study of several other viruses — including Dengue fever virus, influenza , and hepatitis B and C — to learn how often these bugs lose or gain CpG sites through mutations.	0
NewsClaims	27813	Her group found that, in general, mutations that add CpG sites tend to be found in viral samples taken from people less often than mutations that remove CpG sites from the genome.	0
NewsClaims	27814	CpG-creating mutations may be costly to viruses in that they alert the body to infection, so over time, evolutionary forces minimize their appearance, Pennings said.	0
NewsClaims	27815	"That said, many viruses still carry CpG sites, so the mutations may carry some benefit ""even if it comes with a slight cost,"" she added."	0
NewsClaims	27816	So SARS-CoV-2 is not unusual in that way.	0
NewsClaims	27817	"""There are many viruses with lower [CpG] values than SARS-CoV-2,"" Pennings said."	0
NewsClaims	27818	"""When you look at all viruses, the [CpG] value is not strange at all,"" she said."	0
NewsClaims	27819	Xia did find that SARS-CoV-2 contains fewer CpG sites than other animal-borne coronaviruses, and assuming that finding is correct, then it raises the question of why that came to be, she added.	0
NewsClaims	27820	But even if there is an evolutionary reason to explain why SARS-CoV-2 lost CpG sites, that evolutionary reason may not give the virus a special advantage for infecting humans, Pennings said.	0
NewsClaims	27821	"In his paper, Xia noted that studies have ""shown an association between decreased CpG in viral RNA genomes and increased virulence,"" meaning low-CpG viruses appear associated with more severe infection."	0
NewsClaims	27822	"However, although evolution favors mutations that delete CpG sites, and there's a general trend tying fewer CpG sites to more severe infection, ""it doesn’t mean that viruses with low numbers of CpG sites are necessarily more virulent,"" Pennings said."	0
NewsClaims	27823	For example, the BK virus contains very few CpG sites and resides in the kidneys of an estimated 60% to 80% of adults , but typically only triggers symptoms in immunosuppressed people, she noted.	0
NewsClaims	27824	(The virus was named the initials of the first person it was isolated from.)	0
NewsClaims	27825	"If the CpG levels present in SARS-CoV-2 are somehow related to disease severity, ""then this would provide an efficient way for vaccine development,"" Xia said."	0
NewsClaims	27826	In this hypothetical scenario, scientists could eliminate CpG sites from the coronavirus genome in a lab dish, thereby weakening the bug to the point that it could safely be incorporated into a vaccine.	0
NewsClaims	27827	But as of yet, no correlation has been drawn between CpG and the relative severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections.	0
NewsClaims	27828	Several pangolin coronaviruses included in Xia's study also contained few CpG sites, on par with SARS-CoV-2 and the bat virus RaTG13.	0
NewsClaims	27829	Given other genetic differences between human and pangolin coronaviruses, however, the ancestor shared between this low-CpG pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 would likely have existed over 130 years ago, Xia said.	0
NewsClaims	27830	"""We expect a SARS-CoV-2 progenitor to be much more recent,"" he said."	0
NewsClaims	27831	But did dogs serve as an intermittent host for the coronavirus?	0
NewsClaims	27832	At this point, there's little evidence to suggest so.	0

NewsClaims	27838	Save this story for later.	0
NewsClaims	27839	Photograph: Getty Images	0
NewsClaims	27840	So now, as we confront what could be a society-altering disease outbreak, it seems worth taking a hard look at the widely reviled yet seemingly ubiquitous electric hand dryer.	0
NewsClaims	27841	Are they as hygienic as paper towels, as their manufacturers claim?	0
NewsClaims	27842	"The earliest pitches for hand dryers played up their supposed ability when it comes to ""preventing the spread of contagious disease,"" as a 1924 newspaper ad for the Airdry Electric Towel put it."	0
NewsClaims	27843	"More recently, Dyson, whose Airblade hand dryer promises to ""scrape water from hands like a windshield wiper,"" has bragged that its HEPA air filter captures particles as tiny as .3 microns in diameter, much like the N95 face masks that are now selling for AirPod Pro–equivalent prices on Amazon."	0
NewsClaims	27844	But the quality of the intake filter doesn’t address whether blowing air at high speeds is a smart idea given that it may be sending droplets and particles from your just-washed hands flying rapidly every which way.	0
NewsClaims	27845	When you dig into the science on hand dryers, you’ll come across reason to be concerned.	0
NewsClaims	27846	A study published in 1989 found that gentler, old-style hand dryers blew bacteria over a three-foot radius and onto the user’s clothes, which considering the era was probably an acid-washed jean jacket.	0
NewsClaims	27847	"It tested conventional hot-air models with and without filters and determined that the filters ""most likely reduce the number of potentially pathogenic bacteria with the potential to colonize hands but do not eliminate the risk entirely."""	0
NewsClaims	27848	"A 2015 study found that super-aggro hand-dryers like the ones made by Dyson, which use higher-speed jets of air at room temperature, ""produced significantly greater aerosolization of virus on the hands"" than the traditional kind."	0
NewsClaims	27849	Paper towels, meanwhile, were found to cause about the same amount of viral spread as hot-air models.	0
NewsClaims	27850	A 2012 analysis of 12 studies over four decades published in	0
NewsClaims	27851	Mayo Clinic Proceedings	0
NewsClaims	27852	"concluded that ""[f]rom a hygiene viewpoint, paper towels are superior to electric air dryers"" and that they should be used in ""locations in which hygiene is paramount, such as hospitals and clinics."""	0
NewsClaims	27853	Though it could be argued that hygiene should be paramount in the restroom of, say, your neighborhood Panera Bread, too.	0
NewsClaims	27854	"The analysis did find that dryers like Dyson’s ""led to much less bacterial transfer than hot air dryers."""	0
NewsClaims	27855	So does that tell us anything about whether hand dryers could spread a virus like the one that causes Covid-19?	0
NewsClaims	27856	I called Peter Setlow, a biochemist at the University of Connecticut and one of the authors of that 2018 study.	0
NewsClaims	27857	"Setlow is a ""spore guy"" not an infectious disease expert, but he nonetheless came away from that research with a deep and abiding distrust of hand dryers regardless of the model."	0
NewsClaims	27858	"""Sorry, hand-dryer industry,"" he told me."	0
NewsClaims	27859	"""My personal opinion is that they shouldn’t be used."""	0
NewsClaims	27860	There’s been understandable blowback from the hand-dryer industry, which questions the methodology of some of this research and notes that certain studies pegging hand dryers as disease vectors—including the one cited above, from 2015—were carried out by researchers who had worked as consultants for paper-towel manufacturers.	0
NewsClaims	27861	This is true in some, though not all, cases.	0
NewsClaims	27862	Dyson got in on the game by funding a study, published last April, that found—surprise!	0
NewsClaims	27863	—hands dried with the company’s own Airblade harbored fewer bacteria than those dried with paper towels.	0
NewsClaims	27864	There’s reason to be skeptical of last year’s paper.	0
NewsClaims	27865	"In the study, subjects ""slowly"" moved their hands in and out of the machine for a full minute, something no normal human is ever going to do."	0
NewsClaims	27866	Besides, Dyson says elsewhere that the model dries hands satisfactorily in a mere 12 seconds, so which is it?	0
NewsClaims	27867	More importantly, that study only looked at the bacteria left behind on hands post-drying, not whether particles might have been blown onto your clothes.	0
NewsClaims	27868	It’s not just a matter of public health: There are fortunes at stake in the science war between the paper-towel and hand-dryer industries.	0
NewsClaims	27869	Multifold paper towels, the kind commonly used in bathrooms, are a several-billion-dollar-a-year behemoth, and one recent estimate of the global market for hand dryers puts the number at a shade under $800 million, and growing.	0

NewsClaims	27873	If the science seems to lean in that direction, though, why have electric dryers continued to claim more and more tiled territory?	0

NewsClaims	27875	Unlike paper towels, hand dryers don’t create waste and they’re drastically cheaper over time.	0
NewsClaims	27876	The annual cost for paper towels in a public restroom can easily top a thousand dollars, while the electricity required to run a hand dryer costs about a fifth of that, according to one estimate.	0

VG	28877	The first was to find something to do with an aweful lot of spare time and to make some money ( cant live on freah air ) and so the original Parkweb Oracle site was launched and although it wasnt the kind of money I was used to it is enough to comfortable survive . 	1
VG	28878	But like I said 2 reasons . 	0
VG	28879	I wanted to give a little back to all of the people that helped me and stood by me through my addiction - I made a promise to them all when I was back on my feet so to speak I would do something to try and make a difference . 	0

VG	28882	Hence it can be maintained that the nationalization of a concern , or even of a whole industrial branch , is not a socialistic measure since the rest of the economy continues to be based on the principle of private initiative and of the market economy since the nationalized branch is itself subject to the discipline of the market , particularly by paying its way by means of sales rather than by means of subsidies from the state . 	1
VG	28883	The only point we want to stress is that , between a socialized economy and one certain branches of which have been nationalized , there is more than a quantitative difference . 	0

VG	28892	It might , though , make us think about why things since 1945 have been so different . 	0
VG	28893	On the first aspect : the conflict that we undertook ( rightly , I believe ) in 1939 belonged to a world in which wars were still fought between clearly defined sovereign states struggling over the control of territory . 	0
VG	28894	Both sides could ( and did ) inflict the tactics of terror on the other by aerial bombardment ; but whether in France or Russia or the Western Desert , the heart of the conflict was about promoting or resisting territorial advance . 	0
