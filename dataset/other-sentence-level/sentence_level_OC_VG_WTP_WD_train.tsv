OC	58	I don ' t feel like it ' s so astute to point out that the Oscars are kind of pompous and out of touch . 	1
OC	59	Plus criticisms like that , coming from someone who lost , just come off as petty . 	0
OC	60	Add the excessive bitterness , and I don ' t think she really accomplished more than making herself look like an ass . 	0

OC	72	/ end rant from motorcyclist with a brain . . . . and alive after 13 years of riding in sydney traffic : P Edited at 2008-03-05 02 : 27 am UTC 	0
OC	73	Only idiots ride in between lanes . 	0
OC	74	Gay , bi , or whatever , I think that ' s the lesson I learned , and the film is about what happens if you * don ' t * learn and apply that lesson . 	0
OC	75	The publicity for the film gets the film wrong , but I think the film gets this point sort of " right . " 	0
OC	76	I hear you more clearly . 	0
OC	77	I suppose I could agree with you and still go in a slightly different direction : I think stunted passion can drive people to lead lives in which they appear to be passionless . 	1
OC	78	It ' s not an easy mindset to recall after nearly a decade being out of the closet , but I would say that I spent a good deal of my 20s , when I felt both uncomfortable with my own sexuality and isolated about being who I was , using my drive and my power as an intellectual , emotional , and spiritual being to either route my passion anywhere BUT sex , or to holding myself in . 	0
OC	79	In a sense , what the movie gets " right " for me happens most clearly with Ennis ' s character : the force of nature of his passion is one he devotes to containing himself , rather than trying to break free . 	0
OC	80	And he does fail to contain himself in many ways . . . but what ' s tragic is that had he failed a little more , he might have been able to succeed at something a lot more fulfilling . 	0
OC	81	Does that make any sense ? 	0
OC	82	Maybe one way I could come at it is nothing more than this : I had a couple of clunky , difficult relationships with women before I came out as a queer man , and I ' ve had a couple of decent relationships with women since coming out , fucking around with a lot of men , and giving my whole heart and soul to a couple of men over the years . 	0
OC	83	Which is to say : although my desires for women are a fairly small part of my overall makeup , I could only express them decently once I took the brakes off my WHOLE self . 	0

OC	96	There is also a group rallying against our practices with sheep ! ! ! 	0
OC	97	( Sheep have a flap of ' foreskin ' type thing that hangs off their butts and gets painfully infected by parasites and leads to their death - so sheep herders in the maritimes have been and other peoples have been cutting that skin off for THOUSANDS OF YEARS - but now they ' re writting letters to us demanding we ban it . 	0
OC	98	They ' ve got pictures circulating of people from Abu Ghraib , covered in what appears to be shit and blood , being beat , hung upside down , raped and worse - though I shudder to think of what could be worse than what I ' ve seen so far . 	0

OC	141	* smacks blonde wig on Axel * I think as far as DiZ is concerned , he is very smart but also in certain areas very dumb - - witness the fact that he didn ' t notice his apprentices were going to turn on him , when some of them ( cough Vexen cough ) aren ' t exactly subtle by nature . 	1

OC	170	Barring a clear choice based on teachers , however , you might want to save Buddhism for a later part of your undergraduate career . 	0
OC	171	Barring that , I would first go with your instincts based on your knowledge ( direct or by reputation ) of the philosophy professors teaching those classes if you want to choose between the two . 	0

OC	203	The folks they officially grant permission to perform exorcism are supposed to be levelheaded enough to avoid this kind of bad press , while still combating the possessions the Church has to believe occur now and then . 	0
OC	204	It seems counterintuitive , but the Church knows just as well as anyone how ridiculous they would look treating every rebellious teen as possessed , or what have you . 	0
OC	205	The chief of the branch should be even more responsible than the run-of-the-mill exorcist , not less . 	0
OC	206	Yes . 	1
OC	207	Well , frankly ? 	0
OC	208	The job of exorcist is supposed to be rather like folks involved in canonization - to be skeptical , seek solid evidence , then act - not to see devils everywhere and try to solve every problem with exorcism . 	0
OC	209	I don ' t believe in their party line , but they do , and this is inconsistent with what the job is supposed to entail , if I remember correctly from Catholic Boot Camp . 	0

OC	217	I cant even imagine what the medical examiner had to face when they showed up . and I also remember that at first I assumed the husband who got killed was the guy she was fighting over . 	0
OC	218	she got the idea from being a chemical expert in the army , but apparently the training and expertise didnt delve far enough into body disposal . 	0
OC	219	I remember reading that the acid didnt work out as well as she would have hoped . 	0
OC	220	and I havent seen anything on the internet posted since the army took over her prosecution and made her disappear . 	0
OC	221	ya , I cant believe she did it in the first place , and then that she wandered around with the baby and then confessed ! 	0
OC	222	so let that be a lesson . . . if youre gonna cheat on your husband , do it with a guy who doesnt also have an insane homicidal stalker . 	0

OC	1578	Obviously everyone except for Wilf is protected by not having fully human DNA and thus being immune to the overwrite . 	0
OC	1579	So are we supposed to assume that the only non-Master people left on the planet are Wilf , the Doctor , Donna , and maybe the green people ? 	0
OC	1580	The Naismith family also needs some background info , as well as the green people . 	0
OC	1581	Still , how does a former prime minister gather a crazed group of disciples ? 	0
OC	1582	Presumably , because at the end of series three they only rewound to right before the arrival of the American convoy , there ' d still be stuff left about Saxon ' s existence . 	0

OC	1594	What makes it even harder is the fact that she is admittedly open to both sexes , which makes things seem even more possible , but I don ' t know how to reconcile my feelings for her . 	0
OC	1595	I have been struggling with this for a really long while and she has expressed interest in meeting me as well . 	0
OC	1596	I really , really want to meet her , but I am afraid because I don ' t know what to expect , if anything . 	0
OC	1597	Thank you for the opportunity to get this off of my chest . 	0
OC	1598	I can ' t seem to get over this insane crush that I have on a girl that I met in the Colbert community . 	0
OC	1599	She and I have a lot in common and I always eagerly await her comments , replies , etc and find myself wanting to do things for her and talk to her , but I already have someone in my life and it is frankly really confusing . 	0
OC	1600	Part of me is telling myself to be careful because I already have someone , but another part of me really wishes that I could go for her . 	0
OC	1601	I honestly have little attraction to men as a rule in the physical sense , so personality , talents , mannerisms , and interests become more of the basis for my feelings for someone . 	0

OC	1646	I use Photobucket because it ' s easy and the service it provides is enough for what I do ( read : not a lot ) . 	0
OC	1647	But I wouldn ' t recommend it if you intend on linking a lot of people to it because it has a tendency to go " OMG TOO MANY PAGE VIEWS EXCEEDED BANDWIDTH WE ARE GONNA MAKE DIS IMAGE UNAVAILABABLE UNTIL NEXT MONTH ! " 	0
OC	1648	I -could - be wrong about it , but I ' m pretty sure I ' m not . 	0
OC	1649	I was going to suggest Facebook , but FB has a 60 image limit per album and uploads can be a bit of a bitch . 	1
OC	1650	It crashes a lot in the middle of big uploads , which is very frustrating . 	0

OC	1675	i seem to have successfully extracted myself from academia , for the time being - - somehow managed to graduate last sunday - - and have landed in the most mahvelous summer job at the tar pits as the assistant excavator and it ' s like summer camp , only better , because i get PAID to learn anatomy and hang out with the loveliest people and i HURT everywhere my last day at the vile lawfirm was tuesday first day at the museum on wednesday and five days straight excavating since then and i hurt EVerywhere my back , my right arm , my left palm , my abdominal muscles , my feet - - which is bizarre because i spend most of my day lying on my stomach , leaning over a 3 x 3 foot grid of asphalt picking at dead animals and i am just so thrilled to be in so much pain it ' s great and i don ' t have a paper to write ! 	1

OC	1702	It ' s hard to resist arguing with them , but they ' re all so fucking stupid that it doesn ' t even get you anywhere . 	0
OC	1703	I know , it ' s irritating . 	0
OC	1704	I have issues with " film critics " who insert their own visions of what they believe is " proper sociology " --whether it ' s a homophobic straight man sniffing at the concept of two men , or homo-superior asswipes who believe that how THEY met and how THEY live THEIR lives should be the universally-accepted way of depicting man-to-man relationships without accepting differences or nuances . 	0
OC	1705	Some people have issues with the story . . . others don ' t want to deal with the hype about it . . . . others see something to it . . . and all points of view are fine . 	0
OC	1706	As difficult as it may be to crack the shells some of us use to protect ourselves from life ' s difficulties and frustrations , you learn nothing about yourself if you choose to learn nothing from the experiences of others , fictional or not . 	0
OC	1707	I ' ve had my own experience in losing people and property by murder , death , robbery , and accident to know that it ' s awful to live through and easier to deal with with the compassion of others . 	0
OC	1708	I don ' t have to live through a hurricane myself in order to do SOMETHING to help people affected by one . . . 	0
OC	1709	Putting it another way , my mother never had to understand my " thing " for facial hair and particular traits in men in order for her empathize with my need for male companionship . . . she knows the need for male companionship satisfied by my dad . . . 	0
OC	1710	If you can ' t put yourself in a position to either sympathize or empathize with at least one of the things you credit to my " logic " , then the storyline will hold nothing for you . . . and that would be unfortunate . 	0
OC	1711	No , you don ' t need to be bi male shepherds on a mountain in Wyoming to " legitimately " comment on it . . . for you to UNDERSTAND the story , you need to be able to sympathize or empathize with the characters and their situation . 	1
OC	1712	And that is bullshit posturing not worth the electrons that carry their spew of " holding court " . 	0
OC	1713	I think most movie critics are full of pompous self-centered hot air to begin with , and these guys worry too much about the genre and storyline than they do about the technical expertise of the screenplay or the quality of the cinematography or direction or production , or the artistic value of the sound track or skills of the actors . 	0
OC	1714	Aha ! 	0
OC	1715	Yes , it was completely anonymous . 	0

OC	1734	Sometimes the " I am putting all the food I own into this one meal before it goes bad while I am at home for a week " meal ends up being pretty damn good , but it was not the International Passport with Swedish pancakes and lingonberries . 	0
OC	1735	So I made myself a spinach salad with sliced pears , crumbled bacon , shredded Jarlsberg cheese , and raspberry vinaigrette . 	0
OC	1736	I had every intention of going to the Harvard Square IHOP on Saturday afternoon before flying back home , but I realized that I had a ton of food in my fridge that needed to be cooked and eaten ( including a pound of salmon that had gone bad anyway - FAIL ) . 	0
OC	1737	Does that not mean anything to you ? 	0

OC	1747	And honestly , if I wanted to have a screenshot of a site to make it look nice , I ' d probably at least consider using Safari ; the stuff is more typographically " correct " using that rendering , which in the context of an image of a site may well look better . 	0
OC	1748	A lot of people seem to prefer it , though . 	0

OC	2126	Everyone takes turns opening a gift , and if someone gets something you want , you can steal it from them . 	0
OC	2127	Everyone buys a unisex gift and wraps it with no name tag . 	0
OC	2128	It ' s the most fun if you have at least 10 people because people constantly steal from each other and in my family it can get ruthless XD 	0
OC	2129	It ' s better / easier for me if I use packaged egg whites , because then I have a hope of using the " leftovers " before they go bad . 	1
OC	2130	As to why I don ' t have shell eggs , it ' s twofold : I do better when I avoid egg yolks , and my use of eggs in general is mostly for baking . 	0
OC	2131	So as long as I keep that in mind and reduce the oil by at least 1 / 3 , it should be okay . 	0
OC	2132	Really , the only thing likely to give me fits is the egg / oil mix , because I ' ve found that my egg white breads don ' t " hold " the oil the same way when made with whole eggs . 	1
OC	2133	I don ' t have any milk-milk , so I ' ll need to reconstitute some from powder , then measure it , because I ' m not sure exactly how much powder and water are needed for three tablespoons ( 2tsp of powder and 8tsp of water ? ) and with quantities in this range , there ' s less tolerance for error , but that ' s not bad . 	1
OC	2134	I have the flour and the sugar , so that ' s set . 	0
OC	2135	It was a thinking-out-loud sort of thing . 	0
OC	2136	And it ' s not the last word . 	0
OC	2137	According to the head of a group advocating for G / L federal employees , Obama * can ' t * simply unilaterally change pension and healthcare rights without Congressional action . 	0
OC	2138	But something * did * happen . 	0
OC	2139	It ' s not all that we would have wanted , but it ' s more than ever happened under Bush . 	0
OC	2140	The words of my defensive driving instructor ! ! 	0
OC	2141	Believe me , that ' s exactly what was going through my head ! 	0
OC	2142	I understand your frustration and disappointment , but don ' t treat something valuable as nothing because it ' s not everything all at once . 	0
OC	2143	I was envious of them , but I would never be that stupid go between the traffic . 	0
OC	2144	That ' ll learn you ! 	0
OC	2145	The only reason our schools are " competitive " is because the administration choose to do things like this : force us to choose between our own school and everyone else . 	0
OC	2146	and , of course , we are obligated to choose our own school . 	0
OC	2147	I may crash some Paxon after " party , " because I miss you guys , but Stanton prom is free , and your prom is expensive . 	1

OC	2150	I remember it was MIDNIGHT I actually went to sleep whereas when you came I was at the computer . 	0
OC	2151	It seems to me that the overwhelming mass of their garments is only accentuated with the ridiculous level of adornment ; it â s as if someone reached back into the early 90 â s , got their hands on a Bedazzler and went plastic rhinestone crazy . 	0

OC	2154	gosh , that murakami exhibit at the brooklyn museum was awesome , wasn ' t it ? 	0
OC	2155	But if we do , there ' s an obligation to be careful where we point the thing . 	1
OC	2156	It ' s generally a bad idea to make one ' s " feminist " argument at the expense of actual women ' s experiences . 	0
OC	2157	if something causes wisps of steam to begin issuing from my ears , I will almost certainly learn something significant from it . 	0
OC	2158	There are folks whose writing I read primarily for that purpose - though a fair chunk of the time , it ' s my own argument that gets vivisected . 	0
OC	2159	That kind of situation is what the phrase " stop being on my side , you ' re making my side look stupid " was invented for . 	0

OC	2168	Ok have a good evening : ) may be see you later : ) 	0
OC	2169	It ' s not just an academic exercise in utopian philosophy ; real people , with diverse individual needs , will be living the changes we make . 	0
OC	2170	Making feminist arguments at the expense of actual women ' s experiences is , IMO , one of the most significant fracture points within feminism , The reverse is also true : the political is personal . 	0
OC	2171	Mind you , Canada isn ' t perfect , by any means ; another part of why it was possible for me is because my family was supportive - I ' d have been in a much more precarious position if they weren ' t . 	0
OC	2172	Kid won , of course . ) 	0
OC	2173	( My son ' s father didn ' t even get an opt-in ; he was . . . not very stable - but again , Canadian conditions meant I only had to consider that problem in terms of the personal , weighing fairness to him against what it could mean for my baby if he took it into his head to try for custody . 	0
OC	2174	I ' m pretty sure we ' re at least close to the same page - it ' s partly because Canada has some of those social and legal conditions that I was able to let my daughter ' s father opt out . 	1
OC	2175	( IOW , I think he might be a Nice Guy ( tm ) . ) 	0
OC	2176	What I suspect here is that he has a vested interest in not changing the institutional injustices , because in a just world , women wouldn ' t need men . 	0
OC	2177	I suspect the latter , because of him bringing up " pregnancy is so dangerous " as an argument supporting mandatory support - the only connection I can see between them is that the financial support would mean better health care ( assuming the father , or his parents , have or are able to earn enough to make a difference ) and an improved , but not risk-free , outcome ; otherwise , obligating the father ' s involvement has no effect on those dangers ( or may have a negative effect ) . 	0
OC	2178	I ' m not so sure the KiSA is on your side ; he didn ' t seem to have the slightest interest in the injustices I was trying to talk about - at best , he ' s convinced they ' re immutable ; at worst , he ' s got a hidden agenda . 	1

OC	2865	The McLellan family had written to Canadian senators to say they cancelled a vacation in Canada because of the hunt , which they called " horrible " and " inhumane , " Montreal ' s La Presse reports . 	0
OC	2866	While I don ' t at all agree with the seal hunt , I give huge props to this : Senator fires back at U .

OC	2867	She said Americans are not in a position to criticize others . 	0
OC	2868	In her response , Senator CÃ©line Hervieux-Payette said that what she finds horrible is " the daily massacre of innocent people in Iraq , the execution of prisoners â mainly blacks â in American prisons , the massive sale of handguns to Americans , the destabilization of the entire world by the American government ' s aggressive foreign policy , etc .

OC	2871	Full article . 	0
OC	2872	CNN probably unfairly concluded that blacks overwhelmingly voted for prop 8 , but it doesn ' t excuse anyone for voting for prop 8 , because a lot of every race was responsible for its passage . 	0
OC	2873	( Actually , the pro-8 people really really twisted it so bad it made me want to puke . ) 	0
OC	2874	We all know religion was what caused the passage , but my main gripe was that people decided to fall on religion instead of their experience to vote . 	0
OC	2875	But let ' s assume that poll conducted by CNN was severely flawed as speculated . 	0
OC	2876	I was more upset that a majority of people who voted for the issue didn ' t see the measure as an issue of rights and equality for all , just about gay marriage . 	0
OC	2877	Again , expectations were turned upside-down , and that was what upset me the most . 	0
OC	2878	Even the Catholic church made a huge push to support 8 as well , but the Hispanics who are usually very religious only barely supported the measure . 	0
OC	2879	So many good ones to choose from ! 	0
OC	2880	Turns out it was the other way around . 	0
OC	2881	I originally thought that the Hispanic population would have overwhelmingly voted for prop 8 , and that the blacks would be 50 / 50 . 	0

OC	3294	A quick summary is that Apple want the fonts to look nice , whereas Microsoft want the text to be more readable . 	0
OC	3295	After my post a bit earlier in Windows Safari , kurisu posted this fascinating article on the differences between Windows and OS X ( and now Safari for Windows ) font rendering , which has puzzled me for ages . 	0
OC	3296	I think it ' s fair to say that neither is " better " , but it ' s interesting to see the way the different approaches go . 	1
OC	3297	So far we ' ve watched Seasons 1 , 2 and 7 . 	0
OC	3298	Season 7 was amazing ! 	1
OC	3299	We are trying to catch up on Survivor before watching this current season of Heroes vs Villains to really appreciate who all these people are . 	0
OC	3300	Unfortunately , I had only seen 14-19 and Matt had only seasons 18 & 19 . 	0
OC	3301	We can get seasons 11-now on itunes . 	0
OC	3302	But what about seasons 3-6 ? 	0
OC	3303	There are so many great people with intense ( good & bad ) personalities , crazy challenges , big surprises and it ' s all pirate themed . 	0
OC	3304	And allowing men to skip out entirely on responsibility for their offspring leaves single moms in the lurch . 	0
OC	3305	I can find them online for free but the quality is TERRIBLE ! 	0
OC	3306	Anyone know where I can get seasons 3-6 that isn ' t a choppy , garbley mess with a giant logo slapped over a huge part of it ? 	0
OC	3307	The only good thing about this whole nightmare is seeing how loving and selfless people are being towards the victims of this fire . 	0
OC	3308	And that doesn ' t even touch the vast differences between the lives we are able to live NOW versus the experiences of non-urban gay and bi men prior to the 1970 ' s . 	0
OC	3309	It ' s one thing to not understand what you ' ve never experienced , it ' s another thing entirely to disdain what you don ' t understand without making an attempt to walk a mile in the boots you turn your nose up over . 	0
OC	3310	You have to apply your OWN experiences and ability to read non-verbal communication and pluck yourself out of L . A . or Cambridge and the life you live NOW in order to feel the impact of the setting and circumstances of the story . . . and if you ' ve never been in love , never lived with vast distance between you and someone you love , never lived in small-town rural America , never lived with having nearly everyone in a 20-mile radius KNOWING you and your family , never lived with all those people who are the extent of your known world putting very exacting expectations on how you will live and die . . . then you will have trouble connecting with the film and the story . 	0
OC	3311	The story of " Brokeback Mountain " is sparse . . . that is part of its power , because it requires the reader or viewer to put his / her OWN experiences into play and feel the emotion generated from within yourself --not something that grabs you by the shoulders and says " Oh , Bob--I LOVE YOU ! " and turns into a chick-flick full of flowery prose and verbal vomit that leads you to big block letters saying " THIS IS A LOVE STORY . . . YOU CAN TELL FROM THE LINES . " 	1
OC	3312	And while Mars-Jones may have worked with Edmund White and spent some time in Charlottesville , Virginia , I have serious doubts if the Brit truly grasps the lives of rural Americans who are NOT in the " ivory tower " . 	1
OC	3313	I agree with you whole-heartedly about Ehrenstein--he probably has never stepped outside of his little world to see , much less understand , how rural gay AND bisexual men live outside his little bubble of long-term happy partnership in a place where the dirtiest thing one encounters is the street person he passes on the sidewalk and inhabits the happy land of make-believe of movies and live-as-queerly-as-you-want-without-fear . 	0
OC	3314	They are happy to be urban--and urbane- - " queers " of 2005 , and they never presume to " lower themselves " to understand lives that are different from their own . . . very much like the Log Cabin Republicans who are more concerned about taking care of their POSESSIONS than they are about the big-picture of what their political support does to us as a minority population . . . as " W " has no clue or compassion regarding the outcomes of his policies , since he has never lived with privation , never had to worry about how he would pay the bills if his job went away because someone always swooped in to fix things for him if things fell apart in his private life . 	1
OC	3315	That is the big problem with blowhards like them- - they have never experienced the isolation and loneliness and societal pressure put on less-than-college-degreed rural American gay and bisexual men . . . therefore the story and the premise means NOTHING to them . 	0
OC	3316	I ' m pretty numb right now and trying to stay that way so I don ' t have a meltdown . 	0
OC	3317	But it always leads to lives and potential unfulfilled when love is thwarted . . . and depression , too . 	1
OC	3318	It ' s a love story alright . . . but it ' s a tragedy , too . . . passion between two people does not always lead to a happy conclusion when conditioning from childhood and reinforcement by a society that can ' t be separated from your own life makes your allegiance to compliance more important than what you love . 	0

OC	3654	I think my spiffy new icon tells you quite a lot about what I , as a feminist , think of men ( however they identify ) who want to slay villains for me . 	0
OC	3655	As I ' ve already mentioned , I ' m down with ( authentic ) male feminists ; they are my brothers-in-arms , and I ' m very glad to have them fighting beside me , watching my back , and all those other good warrior metaphors . 	0

OC	3659	So - you can see Sir Lancelot in action at Derek ' s Doing Feminism - not Derek ; you should have no trouble identifying the guy in the tin suit in the comments , even before I take him to task . 	0
OC	3660	Since ol ' Lance has already transformed himself into Brave Sir Robin and flounced ( ' bout a six , I figure ; the execution was technically quite good , if unoriginal , until he spoiled it by coming back for one parting shot ) , there ' s little point in piling on him there ; I doubt it ' ll penetrate his + 4 Armor of Complacence ( what , surely you don ' t think he won ' t sneak back to see how we took it ? ) , and it ' ll just distract further from what could be a very productive discussion ( which you could join if you ' re so inclined ) . 	0
OC	3661	Anyway , it wouldn ' t be courteous to Derek . 	0
OC	3662	And , since I ' m going to mention over there that I ' ve snarked about it here , with link , chances are we ' ll have a meal of Silly Knigget deliver itself right to my doorstep - dinner ' s on me ! 	0

OC	4940	I was typing in my e-mail , depending on gmail ' s autosave function to save it as I went . 	0
OC	4941	I spent most of my shift at work writing a paper . 	0
OC	4942	Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck . 	0
OC	4943	Well , internet explorer just " encountered a problem and had to close " and it turns out gmail wasn ' t autosaving ( at least , not since 5pm when I had only a basic outline finished ) and my whole paper is gone . 	0
OC	4944	Assuming height-weight proportionate in both cases , which can make a difference . 	0
OC	4945	Plain . 	0
OC	4946	Looks aren ' t everything . 	1
OC	4947	In fact , they usually lead to an artificially inflated sense of worth for the attractive person , and attitudes which usually piss me off to no end . 	0
OC	4948	Plus they ' ll likely be bad at sex , having never had to put much effort into it and not the intelligence to realize how much fun it can actually be . 	0
OC	4949	The ' plain ' girl probably has plenty of things that make her beautiful , if one looks . 	0
OC	4950	And there are many measures for that . 	0
OC	4951	The intelligence would be a definite aphrodisiac , assuming she knew how to apply it to the situation . 	0
OC	4952	Then there are the girls who are pretty dang hot but seem to think they ' re plain , yet happen to be Mensa material , AND are flexible as hell and passionate to no end in bed . 	0
OC	4953	THOSE are the ones I look for . 	0
OC	4954	It isn ' t hopeless anywhere in the world . 	0
OC	4955	But it ' s a hell of a climb out of the grave they ' re making us think we ' re digging ourselves . 	0
OC	4956	Some are just more blatant and short-term about their despotic megalomania . 	0
OC	4957	You ' d probably have to travel far less distance , if you ' d have to travel at all , in order to live in a place just as corrupted as the US has become . 	0
OC	4958	Problem is , having lived through that myself , as I say , I ' m not sure it ' s a story I really needed to sit through again . 	0

OC	4988	I especially love the guy throwing his mind out the window ( he lost his mind voluntarily ) . 	0
OC	4989	Also , the moon is often connected with insanity ( which you probably knew , based on this poem ) , so it fits together perfectly . 	0
OC	4990	Well , I agree . 	0
OC	4991	Those panels look GREAT ! 	0
OC	4992	Whatareyatalking about ? ? 	0
OC	4993	But it isn ' t any more hopeless than most of the rest of the world . 	1
OC	4994	FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU i would have killed to see that . 	0
OC	4995	It isn ' t like these people and their agenda only exists within the borders of the US or that it ' s an American idea and Americans mean to take over the world starting with their own country . 	0
OC	4996	After all , it ' s a New World Order they ' re aiming for . 	0
OC	4997	I ' m one of the people who is kinda intimidated by you and your many stories but I ' m afraid to tell you that because it would come off as bitchy and maybe it still will . 	0

OC	5009	I ' ll be a guinea pig for the project . 	0
OC	5010	googling that , i discovered that it was probably loaded with a virus / spyware / malware , and so one shouldn ' t do it and just delete the movie . . 	0
OC	5011	how was the performance ? ? ? 	0
OC	5012	Tried a site and after completing the download of two movies and going to watch them via my VLC media player ( plays all / most codecs flawlessly ) , got the ominous message " To play this movie , you need to download moviexplayer from X " . . 	0
OC	5013	. . 	0
OC	5014	This particular argument has more to do with social standards . 	0
OC	5015	It is accepted that all people are " sinners " but Christians are supposed to repent their sins . 	0
OC	5016	I ' m not a Christian so I ' m not sure how " Grace " figures into this discussion . 	0
OC	5017	My understanding is that " grace " has to do with salvation . 	0
OC	5018	My argument is just that it is hypocritical to punish homosexuals for being unrepentant sinners but allow divorced people off the hook . 	0
OC	5019	Christ didn ' t say anything about homosexuals but he was quite explicit about divorce . 	0
OC	5020	The issue seems to be that giving social status in the Church to unrepentant sinners would encourage sin by setting a bad example . 	0
OC	5021	How have we , as citizens in this Land of the Free , come to spit in the face of our Founding Fathers ? 	0

OC	5025	Why should they deny any rights to homosexuals from a few verses in the Bible ? 	1
OC	5026	Bop it ! 	0

OC	5044	: ( I believed in her character , where that kind of thing would take really REALLY good fanfic to be convincing , yeah ? 	0
OC	5045	Poor kids . 	0
OC	5046	So , um , thank you for pointing it out . 	0
OC	5047	. . . how much out of the loop am I to have had no idea there was a new Robyn record out ? 	0

OC	5050	True . 	0
OC	5051	Trite ? 	0
OC	5052	Preachy ? 	0
OC	5053	Do you really think , if he wasn ' t there to do it , you wouldn ' t pick yourself up ? 	0
OC	5054	You don ' t really need someone to save you . 	0
OC	5055	But as it turns out you manage faster on your own when there ' s no one to crawl into bed with you . 	0
OC	5056	That is what I would say to myself : you think you have fallen to the point where he is essential to push you out of bed , you need somebody to do it and he is the only one that cares enough . 	0
OC	5057	They were right ; they just handled the announcement poorly . 	0
OC	5058	That there is even a need for that implies that people aren ' t happy with the government . 	0
OC	5059	The essence of the social contract is that if people aren ' t happy , the government should change--not that the government should try to gather intelligence to increase its power over them . 	0
OC	5060	Well , yeah , and the NSA too . 	0
OC	5061	Still , domestic intelligence ? 	0
OC	5062	Mocking the Catholic church at this stage in history is almost redundant . 	0

OC	5075	Holy shit that is cool . 	0
OC	5076	Is that a white dude ? 	0
OC	5077	On the upside you don ' t actually have to attend any of the lectures if you don ' t feel you need to . 	0
OC	5078	Yes there are lectures on Saturdays . 	0
OC	5079	It ' d be easy to get to cons , has a long battery life , and best of all , isn ' t expensive . 	0
OC	5080	You . . . should get a netbook . 	0
OC	5081	Also , are you going to Anthrocon later this year ? 	0
OC	5082	You could probably pay it off with the savings you get by not running the fan at those speeds all the time . 	0
OC	5083	I ' m not making it out to FC , and it ' d be cool to hang out with you for a while . 	0
OC	5084	: ) 	0

OC	5089	amazing ! 	0
OC	5090	don ' t start today though - lets wait and see if anyone else is in then we can all do it together , i think we ' ll all be more motivated to do it that way xx 	1
OC	5091	I ' m not an expert , but I ' m also going to be doing this on our floors in a couple of months . 	0
OC	5092	I think , if I had it to do over again , I would concentrate more on the edges and use non-water-soluble poly . 	0
OC	5093	They ' re currently working on our house , but should be done and looking for a new project in February or March . . . 	0
OC	5094	: ) If you want an expert , though , we have a pair of carpenters that did a floor in my old landlord ' s apartment , and it looked beautiful . 	0

OC	5105	However , you can ' t do that with everyone . 	0
OC	5106	well being honest with some people is good . 	0
OC	5107	but since you don ' t like the " best friend " idea . 	0
OC	5108	I know you don ' t like the title of best friend , but normally that is the person you can be most honest with . 	0
OC	5109	Ermm . . . 	0
OC	5110	I ' ll say that your inner circle of friends are prolly the only ones you should be as honest as you want with . 	0
OC	5111	Why ? 	0
OC	5112	Ok , that kinda means that being confrontational with everyone is a bad idea . 	1
OC	5113	I guess if you are willing to get along with fewer people , then it ' s really no big deal . 	0
OC	5114	My sympathies and love are with you both . 	0
OC	5115	ever . 	0
OC	5116	I suspect this has to do with a keyboard-interface-related mental trigger - certainly my phrasings , and I ' m pretty sure my debative skills and tactics , become sharper and more precise , when I ' m resisting the temptation to descend into ad hominem arson ( " I may be a skunk , but you ' re a piece of junk . 	0
OC	5117	mitch clementine ! 	0
OC	5118	i bet NO ONE has ever said that before . 	0
OC	5119	Reading the article I ( as a Catholic ) have two theories : 1 ) Dudeman has actually gotten some proof somewhere that the Vatican has been beset by the Devil . 	0
OC	5120	2 ) Dudeman , at age 85 , has a gotten a touch of senile dementia that ' s affected him from investigating over 70 , 000 cases of demonic possession over his career . 	0
OC	5121	That senile dementia is now causing him to see shadows where there are none . 	0
OC	5122	I ' m discovering something very interesting about feminist discourse : if something causes wisps of steam to begin issuing from my ears , I will almost certainly learn something significant from it . 	1

OC	5159	This year â s prom dress assortment is a fabric realization of what can only be described as Betty Crocker â s nightmare . 	1
OC	5160	Cakes , why do they all look like cakes ? 	0
OC	5161	It â s a wonder these posh teens can even fit through door frames with such voluminous skirts . 	0
OC	5162	True to the gluttonous American , these crude confections have enough tulle to feed a third world fishing village , enough sequins to outfit an entire army of transvestites , and enough fabric to clothe all seven the Von Trap children with still a generous portion left over for their fat great aunt . 	0

OC	5233	Sometimes the arguments are so devoid of intelligence , or I ' ve heard them so many times before , that there ' s no reward in refuting them , but if the other side is willing to engage , then having to explain myself and not getting any free passes means that the argument gets a good workout . 	0
OC	5234	Is this HHGGTG ? 	0
OC	5235	But right now we don ' t have that . 	0
OC	5236	Instead , we have conservative think tanks complaining that what little aid we do give costs too much . 	0
OC	5237	What " choice for men " comes down to for me is who bears the cost instead . 	1
OC	5238	I ' m a lot more comfortable with the idea of a father being able to legally opt out if there ' s a sufficient support system in place so that the child ' s mother can raise the child without assistance from the father - even if she chooses not to . 	0
OC	5239	But it ' s not particularly relevant here unless one takes the attitude that child support is supposed to be either compensation for , or an equivalent " punishment " to , pregnancy , and I don ' t see how one can reconcile that attitude with feminism . 	0
OC	5240	And as for calling folks on things , it depends on the situation . 	0
OC	5241	I think the bringing up of " pregnancy is so dangerous " may simply have been a context failure . 	1
OC	5242	I typically see that argument used in the context of pro-choice or childfree advocacy , and he may have just internalized that as " the feminist position . " 	0
OC	5243	So marked . 	0

OC	5823	It ' s like infecting someone with a disease on purpose and saying they " caught " it . 	0
OC	5824	And if you don ' t agree it ' s only because the meme that makes you think otherwise is a strong one . 	0
OC	5825	But , anyway , yeah . 	0
OC	5826	Well , I actually don ' t much care for the term in general , as it means engaging with a corner of philosophy of the mind that I find a little silly . 	1

OC	6052	It ' s her journal , I ' m pretty sure she can post whatever the fuck she wants on it . 	1
OC	6053	Yep , checked there right after checking the main survivor site on cbs . 	0
OC	6054	It looks like Hulu ' s policy seems to be to only offer what is currently being offered by who has that copyright . 	0
OC	6055	I ' ve noticed that with other shows too . 	0
OC	6056	When you could get all 4 recent seasons of survivor on the main site there were all on hulu . 	0
OC	6057	now both hulu and the main site only have clips and bits of the last 2 seasons . 	0

OC	6060	Criiiiptic . 	0
OC	6061	Expect it sometime when I ' m less exhausted and tipsy . 	0
OC	6062	I understand you ' re starting out with a general " someone , " not revealing the sex or identity until a line or two later . 	0
OC	6063	It might ( I say might because this is completely subjective ) be stronger if you stated , " He lost his mind / in the middle of the road . " 	0
OC	6064	Post it ! 	0
OC	6065	Do it ! 	0
OC	6066	Rock it ! 	0

OC	6069	I ' m sorry to hear that keeping up with technological progression is being especially irritating . 	0
OC	6070	I owe you an email , Sir ! 	0
OC	6071	Scary enough to compel you to clean the bathroom ! 	0
OC	6072	: : waves wildly : : Glad you ' re not , like , holed up in a cave somewhere , eating beetles . 	0

OC	6087	I also don ' t have any jobs to give to those 15000 Inuit , native , and traditional hunters who earn a living from this enterprise . . . 	0
OC	6088	I ' m sorry to go off on you - I ' m just so angry at Americans for writing , and for Paul McCartney ' s photo op in PEI . 	0
OC	6089	In this case , polar bears , which used to be numerous in Newfoundland and Labrador , and NWT kept the seals down , but since they ' re on the extinction list . . . they haven ' t been doing alot lately . 	0
OC	6090	The number of seals has actually doubled since the 70s . . . and do you know how much they eat ? 	0
OC	6091	They would populate themselves into famine if left unchecked . 	0
OC	6092	I used to be against it , until I had to study the fisheries and now I get that though many animals are cute , and these are the ones I don ' t like seeing killed ( seals , deers , rabbits , kangaroos ) that sometimes it is necessary . 	1
OC	6093	I don ' t want to get argumentative on LJ , but why don ' t you agree with the seal hunt ? 	0
OC	6094	Do you agree with hunting deer ? 	0
OC	6095	Culling cat and dog populations by neutering ? 	0
OC	6096	The unfortunate truth is that we ' ve killed off many of the predators that kept seal populations in check ( like we did with deer and moose , etc ) . 	0
OC	6097	and i love how that picture turned out ! 	0
OC	6098	congrats . . 	0
OC	6099	all good news ! ! 	0

OC	6104	We will see . . . . 	0
OC	6105	Dude , you are not just barking up the wrong tree , your mellow-yet-professional , probably New Age , yoga-teaching ass is barking up about three different wrong trees simultaneously . 	0
OC	6106	I just hope it reaches you before the New Year . 	0
OC	6107	that was really cute 	0
OC	6108	When he asked for the pamphlets back to pass around to the next class , I stood up and tore my copy up in front of him . 	0

OC	6115	Oh , and she always complains to her husband about how she doesn ' t even know who she is anymore and he spends too much time at the office and is he cheating on her with his secretary . 	0
OC	6116	She ' s just one of those moms who wears the mom jeans while trucking her kids to soccer and ballet . 	0
OC	6117	Neither . 	1
OC	6118	Sent from Vicenze in NW Italy , where it ' s raining a ton but the gelato is good . 	0
OC	6119	I ' m not sure I ' d sign on to the Marxist part of your definition of radical feminist . 	1
OC	6120	That only describes a fraction of the overall group . 	0
OC	6121	In Germany , single motherhood is less common than in the U . S . - people are less delusional about sex and birth control . 	0
OC	6122	But up until recently , anyway , going on welfare as a single mother was not terribly stigmatized . 	0
OC	6123	The German social safety net has been progressively undermined over the past few years , so I have to think that this option is getting harder - they have a lot more emphasis on working to earn one ' s benefits , which is obviously a problem if you have little ones . 	0
OC	6124	( Germany ' s public daycare system is also being slowly de-funded . ) 	0
OC	6125	Sunflower , you were in Canada when you had your babies , yes ? 	0
OC	6126	Because as jfpbookworm points out , the supports are awfully thin here in the U . S . The only reason men get stuck with child support is that society as a whole isn ' t willing to support children of single parents . 	1
OC	6127	At least in Canada , you ' re covered for health care . 	0
OC	6128	( Here , too , in theory , but there are holes in the CHIPS program . ) 	0
OC	6129	First my jaw fell open , and then I laughed so hard I woke the bird AND the husband ! 	0

OC	6132	YESSSS ! ! 	0
OC	6133	lol . 	0
OC	6134	i don ' t see you either ! 	0
OC	6135	I think it is seriously messed up that you think about it . 	0
OC	6136	Also , Jack is going to be messed up after Children Of Earth . 	0
OC	6137	Even though the next episode promises to be even more ridiculous , I ' m still excited . 	0
OC	6138	It ' ll be interesting to see how Donna ' s memories are preserved . 	0
OC	6139	DOOOO IIITTT 	0
OC	6140	I might just do it . . . 	1
OC	6141	This is a really interesting concept . . 	0
OC	6142	What are you doing for the superbowl ? 	0
OC	6143	I ' m gonna be in the stir . 	0
OC	6144	I ' m going to be shopping on my way to work at 7am tomorrow morning because I fail and forgot my office christmas gifts , and then I have to go out and buy Dirty Santa presents on Christmas Eve - oh joy : / 	0
OC	6145	At least with girls , all you have to do is get them something shiny or something that smells good and they will be happy : ) Those pictures of the twins with their dog just made me melt < 333 Nothing is more attractive than a guy who is not afraid to show his love for his pets : ) Good luck catching up on your Christmas stuff . 	0
OC	6146	men are impossible to buy for and it ' s so frustrating ! ! 	0
OC	6147	That ' s crazy . 	0
OC	6148	I ' m jealous . 	0
OC	6149	I ' d fucking love to , but I ' ve already half-commited myself to a spur of the moment trip to NEWFOUNDLAND . 	0
OC	6150	WTF Are you going ? ! 	0
OC	6151	You can ' t really have that kind of set-up though , but a small office might get you pretty close . . . 	0
OC	6152	In a small office where my boss is my dad and I know the accountant pretty well , and I talk to the same fifteen subcontractors on the phone , it ' s not an overly social environment like most other jobs I ' ve had have been ( which is probably the main reason I don ' t have a rapidly developing ulcer right now ) , so I don ' t have to be that outgoing . 	0
OC	6153	About the job thing , I ' ve always just faked outgoing-ness . 	0
OC	6154	It ' s just all so out of control . 	0
OC	6155	I ' ve been listening to news less lately , too . 	0
OC	6156	Otherwise I ' ll just throw up or grind my teeth into little shards . 	0
OC	6157	Change the channel right away . 	0
OC	6158	Any time a Republican says something ? 	0
OC	6159	A friend of mine had the same problem now that we made a gift exchange last week , he had to give a gift to one of my male friends and no one could think of something for him ! 	0
OC	6160	I ' m bringing my gigantic tent , and so far it ' s just me in there . . . if anyone is desperate , and I like them . . . : ) 	0
OC	6161	Ooh , I love the paw one in particular ! 	0
OC	6162	It seems like all the jobs out there are sales , or customer service , and neither is pleasant . 	0
OC	6163	But probably that will be hard to find in this economy . 	1
OC	6164	I want to know more about the other kids too . 	0
OC	6165	I was thinking exactly what you were thinking about Glee . 	0
OC	6166	And the love triangle is a very boring one . 	0
OC	6167	ZZZZT ! ! ! 	0
OC	6168	" Nope--can ' t happen to me . . . " 	0
OC	6169	Well , maybe it ' s something about winter that causes these attempted thieves to lose 30 IQ points , and think they can steal that copper without getting that electric chair effect . 	1
OC	6170	So , there are apparently idiots in other places , but it ' s interesting that they ' re all in northern climes . 	0
OC	6171	Yet another Darwin Award . . . 	0
OC	6172	One isn ' t supposed to eat in the church . 	0
OC	6173	No one should have rolls in the church . 	0
OC	6174	That is so awesome . 	0
OC	6175	I hope it was CC ' d to Paul and Linda . 	0

OC	6181	not neil gaiman ' s house , i don ' t have a passport . 	0
OC	6182	oh motivation , you are illusive . 	0
OC	6183	true . 	0
OC	6184	Christianist lawmaking harms both the law and Christianity . 	0
OC	6185	The variety of " Christian " that would go around trying to codify the exclusivity of their beliefs into law has no more respect for atheists than it does for gays . 	0
OC	6186	Actually it was 10 : 30 . . . . but it didn ' t even wake up Ian ! 	0
OC	6187	Suffice it to say that I got sick of testing concrete products . 	0
OC	6188	I guess my complaint , then , is that your friend ' s ancestors couldn ' t spell . 	0
OC	6189	Nope , no reference . 	0

OC	6216	especially while looking for growing things ! 	0
OC	6217	yes nightwalking ! 	0
OC	6218	I never found mushrooms though , which would be cool . 	0
OC	6219	I used to make things called " night bouquets " which are pretty illegal ( or at least rude ) , where I ' d grab a flower from each storefront I passed until I had a bunch , and then I ' d gift it to someone who would look at it like " um , okay . . " 	0
OC	6220	Those extra ten seconds could come in handy later . 	0
OC	6221	And hey , I figure the quote feature is there for you to use , and taking advantage of it is just the sensible thing to do ! 	1
OC	6222	So helpful to both the viewer and any possible psychopaths waving guns around ! 	0
OC	6223	Garden State ? 	0
OC	6224	It ' s already been so long . 	0

OC	6228	I don ' t know if I ' ve said this to you before , but I really like how you draw things like hands and bodies ( not just your faces ! ) . 	0
OC	6229	Especially the neck and collar area . 	0
OC	6230	Ah oh man , XD ; ; I ' m sorry , but imagining the people who were next to you and their faces is really funny for some reason . 	0

OC	6301	I haven ' t jumped in on a meme of this type in a while , so why not . 	0
OC	6302	If you ' re looking for an honest answer , then I think it has to do with the confidence that being in a relationship brings . 	1
OC	6303	That confidence is attractive to other people . 	0
OC	6304	I definitely have had that same experience though . 	0
OC	6305	I ' ve gone for like 2 years without even a spare though from someone , but then , as soon as I start dating someone , they all come out of the woodwork . 	0

OC	6390	I grant you there ' s a certain amount of urban sniffery in those two perspectives on thot of truth in th my pserspective there ' s also a lot of truth in what they say that most people jibbering madly about the movie just don ' t want to deal with . 	0

OC	6480	Hm , well YepRoc ' s site is not online right now . 	0
OC	6481	maybe it ' s not that they didn ' t want to fuck you before , but just feel safer telling you once you ' re in a relationship and they can ' t really act on it ? 	1

OC	6486	It is streamable from YepRoc - - matter of fact I should update the post with a link to that . 	0
OC	6487	Wow , you didn ' t know ? 	0
OC	6488	I ' m so happy you ' ve decided as such . 	0
OC	6489	This is a great , great record . 	1
OC	6490	I keep hearing people say things like " best record since Element of Light " and " Best Record since I Often Dream of Trains " - - I ' m hesitant to say that kind of thing because I ' m not a critic ; but it is certainly in a league with Robyn ' s very best work . 	0

OC	6497	I ' ll have to ask Fay how she cooked their rooster - he turned out very tasty . 	1
OC	6498	What I take offense at is the suggestion there ' s something wrong with me for disliking the story ( and presumably by extension , the movie . ) 	0
OC	6499	Note that I ' m talking about the response to my opinion of this particular work in the aggregate , not necessarily or specifically yours . 	0
OC	6500	Whether or not the word " love " gets used or not , clearly there ' s supposedly passion in the story . . . but what does it do ? 	0
OC	6501	I take offense at the insinuation that I ' m some kind of traitor to the " Gay Cause " for thinking the story sucks and that the hype around the movie is simply INTOLERABLE . 	1
OC	6502	Passion moves fucking mountains and surmounts daunting difficulties . 	0
OC	6503	It ' s like getting a huge verbal buildup for a fireworks display that turns out to be a guy waving a couple of sparklers . 	0
OC	6504	And no , the story needn ' t have a " happy ending " in order to be satisfying . 	0

OC	6518	What ' s really pissing me off is watching a liberal reporter tour damaged areas of Lebanon with a representative of Hezbollah while he whines about what the Israelis are doing to their cities . 	1
OC	6519	WTF ? 	0
OC	6520	Maybe if your rag-headed leader hadn ' t ordered the invasion of Israel , and the kidnapping of troops they wouldn ' t be shelling the fuck out of your little hidey holes , which happen to be in civilian areas . 	0
OC	6521	Cowardly fucks . 	0
OC	6522	And the reporter is eating it up , when he should be kicking the fucker ' s ass for assuming the rest of the world is as stupid as they are . 	0
OC	6523	Oh , and the whiney ass , self-centered , American bitch that couldn ' t understand why she wasn ' t being evacuated immediately . 	0
OC	6524	" The Italians , and French got their people out . 	0

OC	6556	I ' ve just been tussling with that particularly poisonous variety of " feminist ally " , a Knight in Shining Armor . 	0
OC	6557	I ' d like to say I took him apart , but , while I believe I acquitted myself very well , I fear he missed the point altogether , and flounced with his complacence and his virtuously noble self-image unscathed . 	0
OC	6558	When I deal with them , I sound for all the world like a stereotypical grim-and-strident radical feminist - out come phrases like " sexist entitlement " and " male privilege " . 	0
OC	6559	Nope , I ' m definitely not a Fun Feminist when it comes to that . 	0
OC	6560	A Knight in Shining Armor is the sort of male self-described feminist ( or he may describe himself as a feminist ally , or some other term chosen to show that of course he ' d never usurp our movement - this one favors " radical pro-feminist " ) who is involved with feminism because he ' s Good and Noble , and will slay all the evil misogynistic patriarchal villains and make the world safe for womankind . 	0

OC	6697	I don ' t think this movie was shelved so much because of it ' s being offensive as much as it just being embarassingly badly done . 	1
OC	6698	I know that many animators have been pushing for some kind of official rerelease just because the segments with Brer Rabbit are just damn good animation , but otherwise it wasn ' t hugely financially or critically successful and really didn ' t quite fit next to other live action / animation hybrid family films like Mary Poppins or Bedknobs and Broomsticks on the Disney Classics shelves . 	0
OC	6699	The most labor any black person does is cooking , there ' s no bloody uprising , nobody is beaten , bought or sold . 	0
OC	6700	Remus does get a browbeating from the mother and grandmother for telling stories to the kid , and he does get very " no mam , yessum " humble and even depressed about it , but that ' s as bad as things get . 	0
OC	6701	Not bad as in imoral , but bad as in just poor quality . 	0
OC	6702	It ' s not ever overtly offensive or in any way compelling durring the live segments , but Remus does look tweeked out of his gord durring Zippadee Doo Dah and whenever the little boy cries his transforms into the vissage of a demon . 	0
OC	6703	thank you ! 	0
OC	6704	For two reasons : the animation is some of the best done character animation that exists and because the live action elements are VERY badly written , acted and directed . 	0
OC	6705	So yeah , my basic thoughts ? 	0

VG	7979	There are two real reason I started a couple of forums and they are both related to my former addiction to alcohol . 	0
VG	7980	The above is really some background first off . 	0
VG	7981	However when the problem took hold , the demise to my job and my health also began . 	0
VG	7982	Prior to having a problem I was a UK highly respected IT Consultant and was very successful . 	0
VG	7983	My health had suffered to the point where any job that I used to do was impossible as I am not allowed to drive due to seizures . 	0
VG	7984	Since getting over it nearly a year and a half ago now I had to decide what to do . 	0
VG	7985	The first was to find something to do with an aweful lot of spare time and to make some money ( cant live on freah air ) and so the original Parkweb Oracle site was launched and although it wasnt the kind of money I was used to it is enough to comfortable survive . 	1
VG	7986	But like I said 2 reasons . 	0
VG	7987	I wanted to give a little back to all of the people that helped me and stood by me through my addiction - I made a promise to them all when I was back on my feet so to speak I would do something to try and make a difference . 	0

VG	7990	Hence it can be maintained that the nationalization of a concern , or even of a whole industrial branch , is not a socialistic measure since the rest of the economy continues to be based on the principle of private initiative and of the market economy since the nationalized branch is itself subject to the discipline of the market , particularly by paying its way by means of sales rather than by means of subsidies from the state . 	1
VG	7991	The only point we want to stress is that , between a socialized economy and one certain branches of which have been nationalized , there is more than a quantitative difference . 	0

VG	7994	Thus initiating military action against Iraq is not a simple matter of honouring clear treaty obligations ( as in 1939 ; the case can be made , though with some awkwardness , for the first Gulf conflict ) , nor of rebutting direct aggression , territorial or economic or whatever , against ourselves . 	1
VG	7995	Strategy reorganised itself around a balance of terror , Mutually Assured Destruction . 	0
VG	7996	The post-Cold War period may have seen the dissolution of this strategic assumption ; but it has not taken us back to the age when nation states fought territorial campaigns . 	0
VG	7997	Hiroshima was the start of a process leading to the development of weaponry that made territorial struggles irrelevant . 	0
VG	7998	The long-distance delivery of weapons of mass destruction altered the character of war itself . 	0
VG	7999	The fact that the war was finally won in the East by tactics that had nothing to do with this ( the atomic bomb ) doesn ' t alter the circumstances in which the war began . 	0
VG	8000	It might , though , make us think about why things since 1945 have been so different . 	0
VG	8001	On the first aspect : the conflict that we undertook ( rightly , I believe ) in 1939 belonged to a world in which wars were still fought between clearly defined sovereign states struggling over the control of territory . 	0
VG	8002	Both sides could ( and did ) inflict the tactics of terror on the other by aerial bombardment ; but whether in France or Russia or the Western Desert , the heart of the conflict was about promoting or resisting territorial advance . 	0

WD	9478	However , I think that the evaluation / decision needs to weigh the impact that inclusion will have on the class as a whole . . . not just whether it ' s good for that one child . . . . because , imo , inclusion to benefit 1 at the expense of others is wrong . 	1
WD	9479	Public school teachers make more money than private school teachers . 	0
WD	9480	I understand & support the desire of parents to have their dcs , regardless of abilities ( high or low ) , in the most beneficial educational environment possible and I know that I made some broad statements / gave examples that obviously doesn ' t apply to every inclusion situation . 	0
WD	9481	I do agree with others who said inclusion does need to be done / evaluated on an individual basis . 	0
WD	9482	ed kid w / the same inclusion student if it feels that doing so is beneficial to the inclusion student without discussing with the parents of the reg . 	0
WD	9483	ed . child whether doing so is desired by them & beneficial for their child . 	0
WD	9484	The fact of the matter is that doing so ( calming down a student ) is not their job or their responsibility . 	0
WD	9485	Some schools , though , such as my dcs ' , will repeatedly place a reg . 	0
WD	9486	Honestly there are likely a lot more people that feel the way I do it ' s just not something popular to speak out about here . 	0
WD	9487	But in general , I don ' t think I could ever be convinced that it ' s " wrong " for me to be anti-homeschool . 	0
WD	9488	The best musicians tend to make the most money . 	0
WD	9489	In addition he adds that single-sex education for boys would allow adequate time for male maturation and would benefit the boys by giving them more structure and discipline due to their tendencies of restlessness and aggression ( Mael , 1998 ) It seems clear that single-sex education advocates have done their research and that it does make sense that girls and boys being separated would foster an environment of non-stereotyping and encourage learning . 	0
WD	9490	Thus my lack of surprise to learn that public school students outperform private school students on a level playing field and that public schools and their teachers are more open to innovations and trying new learning techniques . 	0
WD	9491	On the other hand , it can work in the girls ' favour if they do run the class with a teacher and its a very small group . 	0

WD	9504	Based on my experience , and my research on competition , gender , and education , promoting all-girls ' education in the grade school years is a useful strategy to raise women who know how to lean in throughout life . 	0
WD	9505	Further in the study Mael highlights both the benefits for females and males to single-sex education he states that because coeducational schools foster obsession over hair and clothes and tend to make girls more silent that the single-sex education of girls is better for their mentality . 	0
WD	9506	Also , if girls schools don ' t have the interest / enough numbers to run advanced maths classes they may not offer it at all or only offer it as a correspondence subject . 	0

WD	9513	The whole premise of this is flawed . 	0
WD	9514	People have taken their children out of public schools BECAUSE of the poor quality of education . 	0
WD	9515	The downturn in quality didn ' t start with people taking their kids out , it had been going on slowly but surely for years . 	0
WD	9516	Lack of discipline , turning teachers into babysitters , banning prayer and the Ten Commandments , and refusing to have anyone fail are just a few of the weapons that liberals and the Federal government have used to turn the public school system into a disaster . 	0
WD	9517	They have been screwing things up for decades now and to dymb to see the error ( s ) of their ways . 	0
WD	9518	The Public School System is a mess in many districts and it ' s not the responsibility of the parent to sacrifice their child ' s education in order to keep that failing system going . 	1

WD	9521	De La Salle would have mixed results because although single-sex education does have its benefits to boys , there is no clear evidence that exists either way . 	0
WD	9522	Sometimes single sex schools don ' t have the numbers ( or enough interest ) to run certain subjects for example â girls schools may not run shop classes , boys schools may not run home-ec classes . 	0
WD	9523	The point of view that those of us who pay for a private education are some how contributing to the failing public system is just crazy 	0
WD	9524	It ' s an opinion . 	0
WD	9525	It ' s not wrong to hold the opinoin that in general it ' s better for kids to go to school than to be homeschooled . 	1
WD	9526	And I never said that I think all homeschoolers are like the Duggars or all socially awkward , just that the overall " School " experience to me is very important for development of all children , and to me , that can ' t be entirely replicated at home . 	0
WD	9527	I have reasons behind it . 	0
WD	9528	Yes I do . 	0
WD	9529	Do I still think a decent majority of homeschoolers do it for reasons like sheltering kids , religion , wanting to keep control on kids , special snowflake syndrome , etc ? 	0
WD	9530	Do I judge all families that choose to homeschool based on that ? 	0
WD	9531	I ' m sorry but I do . 	0

WD	9536	But , from 2007-2010 , JHS was unable to â initiate this program as designed â and now plans to revamp the program . 	0
WD	9537	There is no need to politicize the classroom any more than it already has been . 	0
WD	9538	So , I guess by the author ' s reasoning , we ' re ALL " good " people . 	0
WD	9539	Good parents do what is best for their children , and they already support public schools with their tax dollars whether or not their children attend . 	0
WD	9540	It went great as far as academics and learning . 	0
WD	9541	I was sent to private schools my first 7 of years of schooling . 	0
WD	9542	It wasn ' t that I was stupid or that my parents wouldn ' t help , it was that I was bored to tears and had teachers who , even obvious to a 7th grader , HATED their jobs . 	0
WD	9543	Then , I was switched to public schooling in a " better " district , and my grades went from A ' s to D ' s . 	0
WD	9544	I know it sounds wrong , but that ' s the way it is . . . 	0
WD	9545	5 ) Religion is a touchy issue . 	0
WD	9546	A 2010 study on two separate pre-school classes displays negative , social affects on students , " In one class , the teacher used gender-specific language to address the children . 	0
WD	9547	The other teacher did not . 	0
WD	9548	It is clear to me that the issue of single-sex education juggles an academic as well as a psychological / social side . 	0
WD	9549	A article published by ABC News focuses on the negative effects of single-sex education when it comes to the social aspect . 	0
WD	9550	But does that single-sex environment only further the intelligence of the " elite " students in private education ? 	0
WD	9551	Again , Penn State ' s Lynn Liben denies any benefits of single-sex schooling , " Kids ' own occupational aspirations are going to be limited , and there could be long-term consequences where , for example , girls are used to being in roles only among other girls , then they have to face the real world where that ' s not the case . " 	0
WD	9552	Another factor in this issue is that most single-sex schools are private , and require an entrance test . 	0
WD	9553	Therefore , one can argue that the students in single-sex schools are already at an advantage . 	0
WD	9554	Studies show that women suffer from a stereotype threat in math and science , meaning that in the fields of math and science women are more apprehensive to perform due to their perceived inferiority to men . 	0
WD	9555	Perhaps that is why girls at my high school were so confident in their work , there were no boys to do better and perhaps this is why women are always found to do better in single-sex school environments . 	0
WD	9556	Even Jesus was against school prayer . 	0
WD	9557	Matt 6 : 5-6 Anyways , children can pray in school if they want to . 	0
WD	9558	Japan , where no one prays at school , has the lowest crime rate of any developed nation . 	0
WD	9559	I mean , c â mon ! 	0
WD	9560	How pathetic . 	0
WD	9561	Are we so weak minded ? 	0
WD	9562	Wow , here we go again . 	0
WD	9563	Christians blaming moral decline on prayer being taken out of school . 	0
WD	9564	At the end of the day , we are not preparing our students for the real world . 	0
WD	9565	That right hasn â t been taken away , they merely need to keep it to themselves . 	0
WD	9566	It just isn â t fair to have prayer required in schools . 	1
WD	9567	Many schools are choosing to spend those limited resources on single-sex programs despite the fact that â there is no well-designed research showing that single-sex education improves students â academic performance , but there is evidence that sex segregation increases gender stereotyping and legitimizes institutional sexism . â 	0
WD	9568	The Socialist agenda of world domination makes no place for solemn â swearing â between individuals . 	0
WD	9569	As a result of prioritizing single-sex classes , these schools don â t have the funds to spend on techniques that have actually been proven to improve academic outcomes , like smaller class sizes and personalized learning environments with mentors , counseling , and other supports . 	0
WD	9570	Private schools usually offer smaller classrooms , and generally provide better facilities for students . 	0
WD	9571	What â s next ? 	0
WD	9572	Today , parents and students can choose a variety of ways to homeschool . 	0
WD	9573	There are co-ops that offer classes to all levels from pre-k to high school . 	0
WD	9574	Some offer these classes throughout the week and you can choose which classes to take . 	0
WD	9575	Others offer classes once a week and parents teach . 	0
WD	9576	In fact , I didn ' t really grasp geometry till I started gardening . 	0
WD	9577	Today ' s homeschoolers can learn Russian or even geometry without their parent ' s assistance through DVDs and online courses . 	0
WD	9578	Homeschool has morphed into a uniquely American creation . 	0
WD	9579	We should all be proud of what it has become no matter where we stand on the homeschool versus public school debate . 	0
WD	9580	Then there is the mix of private school and homeschool , where the student is taught in a classroom three days a week and the parent downloads assignments from the same teacher the other two days a week . 	0
WD	9581	You can participate in any sport or any extracurricular function via these co-ops that you can in public school . 	0
WD	9582	I think mainstream is not that much good for our kids . 	1
WD	9583	There must be some changes for getting out their best from them . 	0
WD	9584	I ' m a regular education teacher . 	0
WD	9585	I have students mainstreamed into my class every year . 	0
WD	9586	My opinion is that it needs to be done far more judiciously than it is done now- if six exceptional children are put in my class , that is the equivalent of putting an entire special ed classroom into my regular class . 	0
WD	9587	I personally feel like these kids are shortchanged- some of them are good kids who need an adult close by and able to give more focused attention . 	0
WD	9588	In a class of 30+ , this isn ' t going to happen consistently . 	0
WD	9589	And some of the ones who come to me have legally imposed modifications , some of which have little or no bearing on what I teach , so I am not allowed to handle my class in a way I think it should be done . 	0
WD	9590	That impairs my efficiency as an educator . 	0
WD	9591	Also , some have so many modifications that for all intents and purposes they are merely taking a special ed class whose physical location just happens to be in a regular classroom . 	0
WD	9592	From my point of view , mainstreaming is not a terrible idea , but it is lamentable in its execution , and because of that , damaging in its results . 	1
WD	9593	Dr . Densmore encourages parents to keep themselves on an even keel and project a steady , positive attitude . 	0
WD	9594	Lib mentality on crack ! 	0
WD	9595	Extreme behavioral trouble , kids that just aren ' t able to keep up with what they ' re learning in average classes , etc . But on the whole , I like mainstreaming . 	1
WD	9596	Besides forbidding perjury , ( calling God to witness a lie ) and false swearing , this passage also forbids all rash and unnecessary swearing , and especially warns against promissory oaths â that require a performance . 	0
WD	9597	Public schools receive money from federal and state governments and are obligated to do whatever the state and national governments say . 	0
WD	9598	I have 2 kids born 3 years 2 days apart . 	0
WD	9599	It is a juggling act for teachers in inclusive classrooms to handle the needs of so many different students but it is well worth the reward . 	1
WD	9600	He also notes in the article the classroom ' s reaction to Jonas ' demeanor ( slow to articulate his words , delay in making his meaning understanding ) and how there is a clearly defined moment where the classroom establishes that Jonas is " different " . 	0
WD	9601	The professor realizes in that instance that this is a moment for himself and the classroom to accept and engage Jonas and somehow help him navigate his way throughout the course and the classroom . 	0
WD	9602	Forced prayer isn â t prayer anyway . 	0
WD	9603	When prayer was removed from the schools I think that it worked to the Christians advantage , not against them . 	0
WD	9604	I have a feeling that all we Christians are asking for when they want prayer back into the schools is for some sort of superior respect above all other religions in allowing us to have our sacred prayers brought into the schools . 	0
WD	9605	How many of us would stand for that kind of equality ? 	0
WD	9606	Jesus said to expect persecution , suffering , being servants of all and to be in the face of regular culture standards . 	0
WD	9607	Why would Christians demand or even expect that their way of doing things should be allowed and even made a routine ? 	0
WD	9608	It makes no sense to expect a public school to act in a Christian manner . 	0
WD	9609	He did not say to get upset when the government goes the opposite way of what is comfortable to us and try to make our systems fit our religious needs the best . 	0
WD	9610	If prayer being in the schools or not seriously affects the outcome of our students , or affects anything at all in the Christian world negatively than I think we have a lot more serious problems to think about than whether or not the kids are allowed to pray or not in school . 	0
WD	9611	It makes no sense to expect a public school to bring prayer back , if that â s what we want , we should send our kids to a Christian school . 	0
WD	9612	We not only have a strong parental relationship but the siblings do as well . 	0
WD	9613	This alone is a wonderful opportunity for building social skills . 	0
WD	9614	The usual argument for private schools is that they have the freedom to offer any curriculum that they choose , and the freedom to hire or fire teachers who can teach effectively . 	0
WD	9615	He notes that student bodies are increasingly riddled with drugs , violence , promiscuity , emotional disorders , crime , illiteracy , peer dependency and contempt for authority . 	0
WD	9616	It is disturbing to read the 101 reasons to homeschool . 	0
WD	9617	How is that for socialization ? 	0
WD	9618	One reason we choose to homeschool is because our family wanted to maintain family relationships in a way that cannot be done if our children are in school six-plus hours a day . 	0

WD	9631	He argues that the language of â separate but equal â in relation to the single-sex education debate is out of place because while racial segregation of schooling was about limiting students â access , single-sex education is about broadening students â access and opportunities . 	0
WD	9632	The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) disagrees . 	0

WD	9699	In fact I had one teacher tell me she didn ' t assign homework because the kids didn ' t do it anyway . . . WHAT ? 	0
WD	9700	They can ' t bring home their books , so they rarely have homework to reinforce what they ' ve learned in school . 	0
WD	9701	I also don ' t agree for constant reward parties for doing everyday things . 	0
WD	9702	So reward the bad behavior ? ? 	0

WD	9706	If you want prayer forced send your child to a religious specific school . 	0

WD	9710	Ok if anyone has actually read this entire thing I thank you for your time and I apologize if I have jumped around a lot . 	0
WD	9711	I know that more than half of you remember when you were young if you didn â t do what your father told you , you were going to get the belt , and you know what you sure never made that mistake again . 	0
WD	9712	In today â s society it has become acceptable to avoid all sense of responsibility . 	0
WD	9713	People today are basically in my mind , for a lack of a better word soft . 	0
WD	9714	Now , you even show your child a belt with the intention of hitting him / her and your own child can sue you . 	0
WD	9715	This was different . 	0
WD	9716	This was saying we believe in coeducation , because we live in a coed world , but in this one particular area we â re giving up . 	0
WD	9717	Those schools weren â t founded on the premise that men and women have incompatible intellects , but in recognition of what were often limited educational opportunities for women . 	0
WD	9718	Their origin stories belonged to the past , and their traditions continued , Hogwarts-like , under their own steam . 	0
WD	9719	Everything I could think of saying sounded offensive or deflating or dumb : math is hard for girls ; theyâthat is , youâneed special treatment ; boys â and girls â brains are different ; pre-algebra with boys in the room is just too excitingâyou won â t know what hit you ! 	0
WD	9720	If we â d chosen an all-girls â school , that would be one thing . 	0
WD	9721	I â d never found the arguments especially persuasive . 	0
WD	9722	But what really brought me up short was imagining how I would explain the policy to my daughter , whose best friends were boys . 	0
WD	9723	A few years ago , when I was looking at middle schools for my daughter , I heard about a school that sounded lovely except for one thing : it had a policy of separating math classes by gender . 	0
WD	9724	Having reported on a vogue for single-sex classrooms in the nineties , I knew the rationale : girls and boys distract one another ; girls need extra ego boosts and a gentle approach when it comes to studying math and science . 	0
WD	9725	The public schools are not going to get better . 	1
WD	9726	no . teachers keep asking for more with no difference in teaching just more money and if they dont get it what happens they strike . well thats real nice on kids education is it not boo hoo you TAKE YOUR KIDS PRIVATE IF YOU CARE AS I DID 	1
WD	9727	BIG E . what about all the money we do send to our schools . does it help our child . 	0
WD	9728	Now , we are talking about a school-sponsored prayer . 	0
WD	9729	No student-sponsored prayer is , or needs to be , prohibited . 	0
WD	9730	But in the Cold War , America was distinguishing itself from a Communist enemy that was known to be atheistic . 	0
WD	9731	So , the school district in New York decided to develop a prayer which they thought anyone who believed in God could pray . 	0
WD	9732	But you have to look at the background on this . 	0
WD	9733	Our country was initially populated by people escaping religious persecution who were looking for a safe have to practice their own religion . 	0
WD	9734	When we came together as a country , we had a religiously diverse population , so when we wrote the constitution , we had to say that the government would not support any religion at the expense of others , nor would it prohibit the free exercise of religion . 	0
WD	9735	Prayer in public schools was a complicated issue where there was a religious diversity amongst students and teachers , because , how could , say , Catholics and Protestants agree on a prayer to say . 	0
WD	9736	( Those of you who pray , do you ever pray generic prayers ? ) 	0
WD	9737	I am sorry but we are forced through our property taxes to support a system that we do not believe works and shows no sign of improving . 	1
WD	9738	We also incur the additional cost associate with sending our child to a school we feel confident will give her what she need to be successful in life . 	0
WD	9739	So I say Allison Benedikt , treat the cause not the system . 	0
WD	9740	The major thing was that I always felt like the presence of boys would have made the girls far less bitchy ( as they did in my co-ed school experiences ) . 	0
WD	9741	My wife and I live in a very expensive suburb . 	0
WD	9742	We pay very high taxes , most of which are allocated to an adequate school system that is monetarily driven by a broken system designed to teach children the answers to the questions not how they derive at them . 	0
WD	9743	As such there is pressure on the schools to meet the GPA standards that there states put on the schools that they have forgotten why the children are there in the first place . 	0
WD	9744	Every other week we hear stories about another child that has died from an overdose of heroin and how it has become an epidemic in the school systems . 	0
WD	9745	The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( IDEA ) of 1990 requires all schools to provide services for children who need special education in the â least restrictive environment conducive to learning . â 	0
WD	9746	And in that aspect , he ' s correct : According to Virginia law , parents who have a religious objection can opt to not only home-school their children but to do so without any government oversight , meaning there is no mandatory curriculum and no checks placed on the family to ensure the children are learning at an appropriate level . 	0
WD	9747	It was previously mentioned in this project that coeducational schools need to adopt a non-stereotyping language and equal opportunity environment to foster equity and success between boys and girls . 	0
WD	9748	There is about 5 cases a year for the whole province of Quebec , mostly very immature children . 	0

WD	9751	He sounds ready . 	0
WD	9752	Everybody in my family ( my siblings , husband â s sibling ) skipped a year in school i . e . moved forward faster . 	0
WD	9753	Three of my girls were born in August , but there is no question of holding them back . 	1
WD	9754	I am a product and proponent of the public school system , and do my best to support to support local public schools ( especially when it comes to music and arts programs ) whenever possible . 	0
WD	9755	I also send my son to a local private elementary school . 	0
WD	9756	More to the point , US public schools are the best in the world . 	1
WD	9757	So , no special education , no behavior problems , and no unbalanced portion of low socio-economic students coming from families with suspect value of education . 	0
WD	9758	If students fail the high-stakes test in America , schools are forced to pass them on to the next grade , again , because public schools are rarely allowed to enforce retention policies to prevent students from being placed in classes beyond their demonstrable ability . 	0
WD	9759	They are required to teach EVERYONE regardless of ability , income , behavior , etc . . . Other countries have education systems built upon the tract theory where if a student fails a test at a certain grade level , that student moves into an alternative education tract that will prepare them for " career " training at their " ability level . " 	0
WD	9760	The ugly truth about private schools is that these institutions can select who attends through entrance exams and other admissions criteria . 	0
WD	9761	It is absolutely correct . 	0
WD	9762	Public schools have neither option . 	0
WD	9763	They can also enforce consequences for attendance and discipline policies . 	0
WD	9764	We were taught tolerance and acceptance . 	0
WD	9765	Clearly we â re off to a great start . 	0
WD	9766	With private schools stealing students away from public schools , the problem is exacerbated further . 	0
WD	9767	This ultimately results in other countries getting to the point where only best are tested and compared internationally , whereas American public schools test EVERY student at EVERY level . 	0
WD	9768	Pulled him out again and put him in a selective school and he ' s loving it . 	0
WD	9769	This could lead to costly court battles , or more children entering into inadequate homeschooling programs . 	0
WD	9770	What if the child ' s parents dissent ? 	0
WD	9771	Although I accept that initial intentions can be noble , sometimes , the language of liberation can carry an unintended payload . 	0
WD	9772	If you don ' t do well , it isn ' t necessarily the school ' s fault . 	0
WD	9773	Public school is what you and your parents make of it . 	1
WD	9774	Everyone I know went to public school and on to college . 	0
WD	9775	It really is up to the student to do the work . 	0
WD	9776	Maybe schools were better then . 	0
WD	9777	We didn ' t feel unprepared . 	0
WD	9778	I hope these kids get a chance in life their parents are denying them . 	0
WD	9779	And people who are fortunate enough to send their children to a private school or to , even better , homeschool , are not going to make a difference . 	0
WD	9780	Social advancement ? 	0
WD	9781	Human nature makes the final result , of anything having a lack of competition and guaranteed employment , stagnation for the simple lack of incentive . 	0
WD	9782	Unions and their inherent lack of competition is what is wrong with our schools , government and anything else unions monopolize . 	0
WD	9783	It ' s human nature . 	0
WD	9784	The problem is without competition , the product becomes stale and innovation disappears . 	0
WD	9785	Unions DO NOT like competition ( try walking across a strike line , you SCAB ) . 	0
WD	9786	For years they nearly had one , the result , the sad shape of our public school system . 	0
WD	9787	Public schools want a monopoly . 	0
WD	9788	Those enrolled in private schools still support public schools thru RET ' s like every other property owner . 	0
WD	9789	Whether the result is choosing a state school , independent school or home education will depend on our children , our selves and our family situations . 	0
WD	9790	If we don ' t make decisions based on our ideas and beliefs , our moral values and our understanding of the world - then surely we are failing to do our best for our children . 	0
WD	9791	To say school is best is every bit as ideological as any argument for home education . 	0
WD	9792	But then everyone is . 	0
WD	9793	But they are guided by their own values , beliefs and yes - ideology . 	0
WD	9794	Others come to it later because school has not worked for their child . 	0
WD	9795	Some choose it at the start because their child appears to be unsuited to early formal education , or because they favour education methods not available in state schools . 	0
WD	9796	Home educators come from many backgrounds , with many different beliefs and use many different educational methods - from the very structured , adult-led to the informal , child-led . 	0
WD	9797	Public schools are fad driven . 	0
WD	9798	Remember new math ? 	0
WD	9799	For example , consider the theories that " boys are visual learners " and " girls are auditory learners . " 	0
WD	9800	Their research suggests that learning is best accomplished when the delivery method matches the subject matter . 	0
WD	9801	According to researchers Dr . Rebecca Bigler and Dr . Lise Eliot , " Placing children into classrooms based on their gender and making assumptions about their physiology , brains , interests , and learning ability will virtually guarantee that teachers ' expectations are biased and their gender-based practices are misguided for most of their students . " 	0
WD	9802	Bigler and Eliot maintain that many of the popular ideas about gender learning are simply untrue . 	0
WD	9803	Still , critics of single-sex education contend that the vast majority of research is based on pseudoscience " laughable to neuroscientists . " 	0
WD	9804	The differences that have been identified are considered too small to warrant separating students . 	0
WD	9805	While co-ed schools can reinforce stereotypes , girls and boys can be free to pursue math , science , poetry , or art , without gender role pressure in single-sex environments . 	0
WD	9806	A mother of a single-sex educated girl remarked , " I feel that the single gender environment has given her a level of confidence and informed interest in math and science that she may not have had otherwise . " 	0
WD	9807	Minna 	0
WD	9808	Anyway , I guess it ' s a individual decision , but I think to do it for any reason but survival is a bit shallow and probably useless . 	1

WD	9811	Any advantage he may have had in sports vanished as soon as the rest of the football team learned their right from their left . 	0
WD	9812	There ' s a real possibility that he would have been diagnosed with a disorder when his real problem was lack of maturity . 	0
WD	9813	It would have been a horrible struggle for him to start at age 5 , and he would have been held back anyway . 	0
WD	9814	I try not to be anti-homeschooling , but . . . it ' s just hard for me . 	1
WD	9815	I really haven ' t met any homeschoolers who turned out quite right , including myself . 	0
WD	9816	I apologize if what I ' m saying offends any of you - that ' s not my intention , I know that there are many homeschooled children who do just fine , but that hasn ' t been my experience . 	0

WD	9832	Not saying that private schools don ' t have problems either but none to the ratio that public schools have . 	0

WD	9847	Co-ed schools are also the cause for some boys dropping out of school when in fact the society benefits by keeping these boys engaged in education and make them complete school . some posters here have admitted girls could better benefit by attending single sex-schools than co-ed schools . 	0

WD	9855	What a stupid argument ! 	0
WD	9856	We are all so glib in the way we promise and don â t perform and never realize that it is sapping our moral energy . â Think then , what happens to a nation rife with perjury , broken marriage covenants , unforgiveness , cults with demonic covenants , extortion , bribery , libel , slander , profanity , hypocrisy , idle talk , and lawsuits initiated solely for revenge and personal gain . 	0

WD	9860	I felt I was letting both sides down when teaching in an inclusive secondary in London . 	0
WD	9861	The presumptions behind it are fusty and often plain sillyâwhich might make them easy for kids who don â t conform to them to dismiss , except that their teachers and principals are repeating them so earnestly . 	0

WD	9871	Well last night I caught 60 Minutes ' rebroadcast of Redshirting - Holding kids back from kindergarten , which I had missed back in March , and I was , once again , all in a huff . 	0
WD	9872	This piece of journalism , as have many others ( in both print & broadcast ) focused solely on the superficial and relatively transient perceived benefits of holding your 5-year-old back , while Mr . Safer & team failed to explore any of the real developmental reasons some children really do need to put off kindergarten for a year and how that extra time may benefit them in the short and long term . 	0

WD	9880	Redshirting your 5-year-old solely for the purpose of giving them an advantage in sports , a leg up in the future popularity contest , or just to save them from the horrible fate of being the " youngest " in their class ( and the last to have a driver ' s license ) drives me NUTZ ! 	0

WD	9884	I tended to teach the kids in my class as individuals . 	0
WD	9885	I would also like to add that I personally , in many years in a very mixed comprehensive in Inner London , never took the blindest bit of notice of who was currently " failing " as a group , whether it be black , Asian , white boys , girls or bunny rabbits . 	0
WD	9886	At school , or homeschooled . 	0
WD	9887	The kids that do well and attain up to their optimum levels are the ones with good parental support . 	0
WD	9888	You really can ' t expect a child to listen to a teacher telling them they can succeed , when their parents can ' t be bothered to pick them up after a football match , or send them to school dirty , unwashed . 	0
WD	9889	Sadly , many parents seemed to regard school as a babysitter , not something to be worked with , and were all to ready to blame the teachers or school rather then themselves or the child . 	0
WD	9890	If a teacher can call the parent and get backed up , and work with the parent , then the kid will do well and work through difficulties . 	0
WD	9891	The one factor that I did notice made the biggest difference was , as mentioned above , parenting . 	0
WD	9892	My high school graduating class had fewer than 50 seniors , yet PTA meetings had to be held in the auditorium . 	0

WD	9898	I taught in public high schools for 15 years . 	0
WD	9899	My advice to parents ? 	0
WD	9900	It is time we stop rewarding a bad system , and reform it with the good old reward system that promotes doing better called competition . 	0
WD	9901	The school board for my system was made up of lay people , each of whom had a personal agenda that had nothing to do with education . 	0
WD	9902	In 15 years I never saw a board member visit either of my two schools . 	0
WD	9903	I believe a more disciplined school in the formative teenage years pays off when the child matures . 	0
WD	9904	I know my friend ' s case is rather extreme , but the thing is . . . the vast majority of my homeschooled friends have similar issues . 	0
WD	9905	Many of them are also very over-protected by their parents , and many of them , to be honest , act more like 6th-graders than 10th-graders . 	0
WD	9906	Jewelry ? 	0

WD	9911	Just because we had a strict uniform , by no means did that mean there wasn â t competition wardrobe-wise . 	0
WD	9912	I was sent on a wild goose chase from clique to clique . 	0
WD	9913	I actually had to go down there one day , find the culprit and set the record straight . 	0
WD	9914	There was to be no cross-contamination between groups ; you had to choose your friends or the queen bees would choose for you . 	0
WD	9915	When I eventually found her , she gave me a snobby and unapologetic , â Sorry , are we done here ? â , swiveled on her pink Converse and strutted in the opposite direction . 	0
WD	9916	Not everything in the media is okay . 	0
WD	9917	Being outdoors by yourself can be dangerous . 	0
WD	9918	She acts younger than her age , and I often find that in order to get along with her , I have to act less mature as well . 	0
WD	9919	Now , I understand her parents ' point of view . 	0
WD	9920	But if you ' re going to survive in it , you have to know what you ' re up against . 	0
WD	9921	I can tell you without a doubt that when my friend reaches adulthood and leaves home , she will be stepping into a world that she knows nothing about , and she ' s going to suffer because of it . 	0
WD	9922	Would she send me to a public school now - ABSOLUTELY NOT ! ! ! 	1
WD	9923	I was even a public school high school teacher ! 	0
WD	9924	I trust that was tongue in cheek ? 	0
WD	9925	And , until America starts realizing that education is a privilege that should be supported and respected , where teachers are revered , we are always going to have problems . 	0
WD	9926	But she ' s not a child anymore , she ' s going to legally be an adult in two years , and she does not understand the world at all . 	0
WD	9927	So yes , if you want a strong , no bull , parent supported , child first , customer service-based , " you will follow the rules or you will get kicked out " educational atmosphere where education and discipline and respect are demanded , then you should send your child to a private school . 	0
WD	9928	And as long as the schools live in fear of these parents and " live to serve the public " and don ' t want to anger parents and are worried about their government funding , they are always going to kowtow to pissy parents and weak teachers and administrators . 	0
WD	9929	Yeah , the world is a pretty suckish place , and I can completely understand why any parent would want to shield their child from it . 	0
WD	9930	I can not believe that someone in the room did not beotch slap her for suggesting such lunacy . 	0
WD	9931	There is no more public education , it is all indoctrination , warm and fuzzy political correctness . 	0
WD	9932	She is a total marxist moron . 	0
WD	9933	They have something to lose if they act a fool . 	0
WD	9934	YOU ARE IDIOTS . 	0
WD	9935	I apologize , but your child may be playing violent video games and what not , but when they go out and rape or shoot someone . 	0
WD	9936	Parents are the ones that are supposed to be teaching they â re kids values and morals and what is right and wrong . 	0
WD	9937	O â and side note all those parents that think that â Angry Music & Video Games â are the root of all evil and its what â s causing your children to become evil and lash out at society . 	0
WD	9938	SOCIETY SIDE NOTE : The reason that society is bad today is not because of the lack of Fear for God . 	0
WD	9939	It is because of what our society has become . 	0
WD	9940	It will not be because of the video game it will be your lack of parenting , maybe you should have hit them those last few times . 	0
WD	9941	And if any of you are saying â Well what about the belt ? â there is a difference between getting a belt to the butt and physically assaulting your child multiple times with your fists . 	0
WD	9942	All parents carefully consider their child ' s education and those decisions are not taken lightly . 	0
WD	9943	The parents think of school as a free baby sitter . 	0
WD	9944	People who send their children to a private school are not â bad â people . 	0
WD	9945	I ' m just going to say " so why not move her to 3rd grade where she belongs ? " 	0
WD	9946	They want the best for their kids ! 	0
WD	9947	I have worked for a group that goes into the school systems to talk to the kids . 	0
WD	9948	I think the individual schools themselves and and the individual needs of your daughters are more important than generalisations about education and single-sex or co-ed schools . 	0
WD	9949	However , if you want an opinon from a general education pespective , and you can read up on this , the general rule is that single sex schools are better for the academic performance of your daughters . 	1
WD	9950	Research is quite clear about this . 	0
WD	9951	The children in the private system , are polite , listen to what you are telling them and responsive . 	0
WD	9952	For the benefit of chidlren of course . 	0
WD	9953	I agree - Kids can do great in the public school system and parents DO need to be involved . 	1
WD	9954	It is wasting valuable school time . 	0
WD	9955	I have had parents tell me , I gave birth , my job is over , it is your ( mine , the teachers , ect ) to raise and educate these kids . 	0
WD	9956	It stems from children having kids , forcing them off on the grandparents , and the children thinking that they mother is there sister . 	0
WD	9957	One of the benefits of SEN education arguably benefits all children ; class sizes are smaller ensuring a better teacher to pupil ratio . 	0
WD	9958	How prevalent is redshirting anyway ? 	0
WD	9959	*How many homeschooling families do you know ? * I cited three as specific examples , so you ' re way off already . 	0
WD	9960	*None of them cite a desire to avoid diversity as a reason to homeschool . * There are numerous studies on why people homeschool , and a significant portion of the reasons boil down to " wanted to avoid having my children subjected to opinions , values , beliefs , etc . , that I don ' t agree with .

WD	9961	Do you have any advice on how to start to get people together and have the law changed and to allow school prayer back so it will be constitutional ? 	0
WD	9962	I will like to start prayer in the schools of Moses Lake , Wa . 	1
WD	9963	You can pray whenever you want . 	0
WD	9964	Do not be like them , for your Father knows what you need before you ask him . â 	0
WD	9965	I always thought of girls as the sports stars and the valedictorians , because at my school they were . 	0
WD	9966	But when you pray , go into your room , close the door and pray to your Father , who is unseen . 	0
WD	9967	I tell you the truth , they have received their reward in full . 	0
WD	9968	And when you pray , do not keep on babbling like pagans , for they think they will be heard because of their many words . 	0
WD	9969	Then your Father , who sees what is done in secret , will reward you . 	0
WD	9970	This entire article is ridiculous . 	0
WD	9971	Who are you all to say that we need God in our lives . 	0
WD	9972	You can pray quietly whenever you want and does the bible not say in : Matthew 6 : 5-8 â And when you pray , do not be like the hypocrites , for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men . 	0
WD	9973	You are still allowed to pray in school as long as it doesn â t affect the education that the school system is trying to give our children . 	0
WD	9974	All the enrichment camps and afterschool activities will not make up for the fact that your kid is bored for 6-8 hours per day in school and whips through their homework in a flash , or takes all night because they are so bored they can ' t stand it . 	0
WD	9975	I believe that parents should send their kids to the school the best fits the needs of the child at the time . 	0
WD	9976	Yes , parents can provide support and should , but when your child is bored at school , there is only so much you can do to help with that . 	0
WD	9977	Occasionally , you will get lucky and have a teacher that will challenge your kid in class , but if not , then what ? 	0
WD	9978	And it is the cornerstone of a child â s well-being , â Densmore told me . 	0
WD	9979	The National Association for the Education of Young Children offers lots of information about the benefits of play and how parents and teachers can help facilitate it . 	0
WD	9980	Prayer should be back in school to give these kids that are going up a sense of belief , trust and fear of God , because kids these days think they could do anything they want to and get away with it . 	1
WD	9981	On the community level , Densmore encourages parents to take an active role . 	0
WD	9982	Parents should talk with teachers , principals , and other parents . 	0
WD	9983	Look for preschools with facilitated play as the center of their curriculum . 	0
WD	9984	I have only one more problem . 	0
WD	9985	Where would we find enough time for an actual school day ? 	0
WD	9986	This is where the difference is . 	0
WD	9987	Teaching things that contradicting any belief , or lack of belief , is one thing . 	0
WD	9988	Teaching " God " and then praying to that deity is something else , and just as problematic as teaching " no God " then insisting all recite " There is no God " at some point in the school day over and over . 	0
WD	9989	Now if those who would prefer the be public school prayer have no problem with children reciting that last one too , and also showing similar respect to any other deity ( ies ) any of them might possibly believe in , or their family does . 	0
WD	9990	If the shoe were switched would those so quick to treat enforced prayer as something that hurts no one if they were taught to pray to Allah , Zoroaster , Zeus and the Gods ? 	0
WD	9991	The inmates are running the asylum in many public schools . 	0
WD	9992	They cannot correct errors , cannot encourage high achievers for fear of upsetting the regular students , assign homework , or expect respect from the students . 	0
WD	9993	No matter how much we may or may not respect Darwin and what he brought forth , he was no God , as I ' m sure all would say . 	0
WD	9994	No matter when your child starts kindergarten , it â s a new beginning for him or herâand for you . 	0
WD	9995	Additionally , many homeschooling families belong to like-minded groups that meet regularly and participate in field trips . 	0
WD	9996	The more people leave , the worse its going to become . 	0
WD	9997	Pray on your own time . 	0
WD	9998	They do not belong . 	0
WD	9999	Offend everybody equally ! ! 	0
WD	10000	No prayers in schools ! 	1
WD	10001	And if the answer to that is " Maybe , but those children are still alive " , then consider this : an estimated 16 children per year commit suicide because of problems at school . 	0
WD	10002	Even the language of the serious case review demonstrates this failure of understanding . 	0
WD	10003	Small wonder that home-educating parents are afraid of conferring power on people who do not know what it is that they are judging . 	0
WD	10004	This is particularly so for families who have taken children out of school ; they would be in the insidious position of being answerable to a system that they believe has already failed them . 	0
WD	10005	The idea that you can protect children simply by increasing government involvement ignores the difficulties the education system itself imposes on the lives of many families . 	0
WD	10006	Every year we would by used uniforms and used books whenever possible . 	0
WD	10007	My Parents could barley afford to send my sister and I to private school . 	0
WD	10008	When we moved to an areas with better schools , we would go to public schools or magnet schools . 	0
WD	10009	We took sack lunches and cut cost where ever possible . 	0
WD	10010	Both my sister and I plan to send our children to private school as well . 	1
WD	10011	We scrapped by then and now my sister and I have been pretty successful in life . 	0
WD	10012	Because we got a better education than was available in most public schools . 	0
WD	10013	Why ? 	0
WD	10014	My parents would have always send us to Public schools if they were good schools . 	0
WD	10015	When we both got to college we were ahead of the game with AP credits and CLEP tests . 	0
WD	10016	He made this children take the Vineyard Adaptive Behavior Scales test , which identifies well-adapted behaviors and maturity . 	0
WD	10017	Why don ' t students that have a particularly strong religious faith go to schools that are especially for them ( e . g . Muslims go to Muslim schools , Christians to Christian schools , Jewish to Jewish schools etc . ) , and for all other students , no religious doctrine in the schools , period . 	1
WD	10018	Here ' s a suggestion : why don ' t we all stop pretending that Canada is this utopian place where everyone holds hands and sings about buying the world a coke in their own language . 	0
WD	10019	I find it simply offensive that Christianity is seen as some sort of imperialistic oppressive practice even when the majority of the students in the class are Christian , because it makes students of other faiths ' uncomfortable , yet any other religion cries racism when the situation is reversed . 	0
WD	10020	If my memory serves me correctly , there has been plenty of controversy over reciting the Lord ' s Prayer in schools , yet this special status has been given to Muslim students , in this case . 	0
WD	10021	If so then people better start brushing up on their knowledge of less widely practiced religions , such as Wicca , Shinto , Satanism , Kabbalah , Bahai ' i , etc . And what happens when one practice interferes with another practice ' s beliefs . 	0
WD	10022	Are we supposed to grant exceptions to everyone claiming to be part of a religious group ? 	0
WD	10023	When does it end ? 	0
WD	10024	We are getting to a place in this country where political correctness is trumping almost everything else . 	0

WD	10026	Hi Carol This is such sound advise and thank goodness there are Head Teachers like yourself out there ! ! 	0
WD	10027	My Son has complex needs and starts mainstream in September and it makes me angry when I hear Parents like Joanne having such a struggle to find a place for their Child I agree too , that although labels are scary for Parents , with them , the Children do get more benefits and support , so can be a positive thing Fran 	0
WD	10028	These beliefs on the effects of homeschooling on socialization have led to numerous studies on homeschooled kids . 	0
WD	10029	Rather than prove these beliefs to be correct , they show a very clear picture that homeschooled children and teens present a distinct advantage over their peers in public school . 	0
WD	10030	Because of the growing incidences of peer pressure and bullying , violence , drugs , promiscuity and moral relativism , the greater is the belief of parents that they need to take their kids out of public school before these influences have a detrimental effect on both their lives and their future . 	0
WD	10031	It is ironic to say the least that in Dr . Brian Ray â s California study , around 92 percent of public school superintendents harbors the erroneous notions that homeschooled kids are socially impaired , emotionally unstable , and â too judgmental â of their community and the world in general . 	0
WD	10032	President Theodore Roosevelt once said , â To educate a man in mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to society . â 	0
WD	10033	This is an ideal that is being espoused by homeschooling parents who no longer wish to expose their children to the questionable teachings and people that are a part of the public school system . 	0
WD	10034	Teachers , on the other hand , are afraid that they will lose their jobs to more effective parents who are not even certified educators . 	0
WD	10035	It is not surprising , therefore , that they would constantly put down homeschooling as not an effective form of education , specifically targeting the â lack of social skills â as a main point against homeschoolers . 	0
WD	10036	What she will get is brainwashed to be a liberal zombie and grow up to write and believe stupid articles like this one . 	0
WD	10037	What a load of BS . 	0
WD	10038	All I can say is WOW ! ! ! 	0
WD	10039	That ' s right , I do not give a s**t about the public schools system , I care about giving my child the best education and best opportunities possible and she will NOT get that at a public school . 	0
WD	10040	I never post on these things but today I had to . 	0
WD	10041	However it may take a little while to really settle down to an â absence of a rigid routine â before you can enjoy this freedom from timetables and rules of an educational institution . 	0
WD	10042	Greater Freedom â The morning rush to catch the school bus â¦ it all seems to belong to some distant world now , â smiles Mariam , who has been homeschooling her only child for the past two years . 	0

WD	10050	I â m thinking / planning on submitting this to the local Sarnia newspaper in repsonse to all the poorly written letters lobbying for prayer to be brought back into the schools . 	0
WD	10051	Additionally , it is said that homeschooled children do well on standardised tests , and as adults , are known to be self-directed learners and reliable employees . 	0
WD	10052	On the other hand , as a family member recently pointed out to me , by homeschooling children we could be stunting the development of their socialisation skills . 	0
WD	10053	I make that point because teachers specialise in specific subject areas and if parents choose to homeschool their children , it is expected that they would have vast knowledge of each subject area which they choose to teach their children . 	0
WD	10054	Research in the United States has shown that homeschooling is growing at a rate of seven to 15 per cent per year , with millions of children currently learning at home . 	0
WD	10055	Indeed , that is a distinct possibility and the onus would have to be on the parents to ensure that does not happen . 	0
WD	10056	And , some studies indicate that children who are redshirted also have higher use of special education services in elementary school and higher rates of behavioral problems in adolescence . 	0
WD	10057	I ' m always fasinated by the ideology argument . 	0
WD	10058	But to just bring in services for one group flies in the face of equality . 	0
WD	10059	I think that religion should be either implemented for ALL religions ; or otherwise , for none . 	1
WD	10060	Doesn â t it make sense that they would therefore do a better job and that public schools would therefore do better in quantitative comparisons ? 	0
WD	10061	The public school system lets them deal with real life too , unfortunate that it may be but that is what ' s out there in college and the work force too . 	0

WD	10067	I attended a single sex high school some 40 years ago . 	0
WD	10068	Granted that was a different day but still I cherish the memory . 	0
WD	10069	Adolescence is hard enough without having to try learning in an environment of hormone-laced competition and distraction . 	0
WD	10070	If I had teen-aged children today I would seek out single-sex education for them without hesitation . 	1
WD	10071	Then those who ran public education decreed that every child should have a college-prep curriculum . 	0
WD	10072	When I left that school , seniors were lucky to have two hours of shop ; the rest of the time they spent taking courses for which they had no need , desire or use . 	0
WD	10073	The Supreme Court said that it violated the establishment clause of the Constitution to have this prayer , even though the prayer was a generic prayer . 	0

WD	10078	Co-ed schools these days are becoming morally corrupt . 	0
WD	10079	Most Kids are distracted , do a lot of sexting , indulge / experiment in sexual acts , go on emotional outbursts ( act like adults ! ) and so on . . . 	0
WD	10080	You are a bad person if you don ' t do whatever it takes to get YOUR child the best education and start in life possible , and if that means sending your child to private school , that ' s what you do . 	1
WD	10081	So , does delaying kindergarten give kids a head start ? 	0
WD	10082	Private and parochial schools are more likely to adhere to the same value system as the families whose kids attend them , while public schools tend to reflect the values of whatever politician is in charge of them at the moment . 	0
WD	10083	I found the attitude and behaviour of students in the co ed school to be better , and i attribute that to the influence of the opposite sex . 	0
WD	10084	IMO the only ' bad person ' here is the person writing the article . 	0
WD	10085	The writer is free to send her kids wherever she wants and so is everyone else . 	0
WD	10086	Even despite this range , the overall frequency is much lower than previously thought . 	0
WD	10087	However , evidence also indicates that age at school entry is a poor predictor of school success , with younger children performing just as well or better than their older peers . 	0
WD	10088	It appears that it can , at least for the first few years of elementary school , and this is especially true for kids who are already at risk for school difficulties due to socio-economic factors ( unfortunately those are also the kids who are least likely to start later ) . 	0
WD	10089	I have five Daughters and they all went to private schools and everyone of them have a degree and now have good paying jobs . 	0

WD	10093	This is the caliber of people we have in some schools in the public system . 	0
WD	10094	This fool was reinforcing bad behavior . 	0
WD	10095	We used to call it " being held back " where I grew up . . . 	0
WD	10096	" Parents make that decision for all kinds of different reasons . 	0
WD	10097	Tried for three years to keep my children at the local public school . 	0
WD	10098	On the school board etc . If they want the middle class to leave their kids at public school they need to put effort in to meet their educational needs of the children and give us a reason to stay not just fob us off with your children will be all right because of their demographic background . 	0
WD	10099	The standard was set at the lowest common denominator with no effort put into challenge children who were bored . 	0
WD	10100	They need to bring back classes where all children ' s needs are met not just the worst behaved , why should the whole class be punished because one child ' s behaviour . 	0
WD	10101	Composite classes should be discouraged as teachers are unable to meet all the levels needed and are more likely to ignore those who can do the work at the higher grade . 	0
WD	10102	They do not have time to offer more complex work or seem reluctant to celebrate intelligence , attention to detail and completing work that comes from the higher achieving students . 	0
WD	10103	In all of the three years before baled from public school despite talks and promises that things would improve nothing changed . 	0
WD	10104	We left and went from bored , hating school children to excited about learning , keen to get to school , enthused again . 	0
WD	10105	Not exactly over night but certainly by the end of the 2nd term at the new school . 	0
WD	10106	Public schools need to do more to keep those of us who care about education attending their schools . 	0
WD	10107	You want creativity , not teaching to the test . 	0
WD	10108	But there is in practice very limited access to these - it costs money , and these schools are few and far between . 	0
WD	10109	When Ed Balls thinks about all those children growing up uncontaminated by all this his head must nearly explode . 	0
WD	10110	One single ideology ! 	0
WD	10111	You want great outdoor space and small classrooms and personal attention . 	0
WD	10112	If you look at education philosophy and ideas it becomes clear that our current state school system is very much based on a narrow set of ideas . 	0
WD	10113	To not have an ideology - does this mean that you don ' t think that any other world view is acceptable , or that you simple don ' t think ? 	0
WD	10114	That it is wrong to do something because you belief it is right and have thought about the ideas behind it ! 	0
WD	10115	If they survive all this lot they can be brainwashed into embracing multiculturalism , diversity , man-made climate change and sex education , even when their parents don ' t want it for them . 	0

WD	10121	Upon leaving my all girls school , I learned that someone there had told people I left due to a heroin addiction . 	0
WD	10122	I mean , WHAT IN THE WORLD ? ! 	0
WD	10123	I asked them to tell me why . 	0
WD	10124	I later learned that I came off as a combination of snobby , shy and rude â simply because I hadn â t spent enough time in social situations or just being around the opposite sex , and I had no idea how to talk to them ! 	0
WD	10125	Switching schools changed that all for the better . 	0
WD	10126	Having spent middle school â those really developmental years , around very few boys â talking to them became a major cause of stress . 	0

WD	10138	I sent my kids to a private , religious based school . 	0
WD	10139	I wanted my children to grow up with their faith being a part of their every day lives . 	0
WD	10140	Also , if your children attended this school , parent involvement was an expectation . 	0
WD	10141	As a result , every Home / School association meeting was packed . 	0
WD	10142	Everyone went to orientation . 	0
WD	10143	I knew the parents of every child my kids went to school with . 	0
WD	10144	Disipline was never a problem - if there was a concern with your child , you met with the teacher and / or the principle and worked out a solution . 	0
WD	10145	They never had any issues with bullying ( they had an anti-bullying program before it was popular ) . 	0
WD	10146	I personlly am acquainted with four families who are home schooling their large families . 	0
WD	10147	All four have no intention of book-schooling their daughters past age 13 as they need to learn : homemaking skills " . 	0
WD	10148	One of the girls , who has not been taught for two years , could be Josh Powell ' s twin . 	0
WD	10149	She is intelligent and desperate to learn , but her parents won ' t allow it . 	0

WD	10152	As an admissions officer , we had applicants whose " record keeping " consisted of sending boxes full of paper for our office to review as part of the application . 	0
WD	10153	If their students did get an interview , which was rare , they didn ' t have the social skills to survive the first round . 	0
WD	10154	Wow . 	0
WD	10155	Even when they beg this from you ? 	0
WD	10156	It ' s 12 : 40 . . . 	0
WD	10157	That the Commonwealth of Virginia has such a rich tradition of the education of young people and allows this travesty is shameful . 	0
WD	10158	The point is not to fling those stereotypes back and forth , but to have a respectful discussion about the ideas of a home education versus a public standardized environment . 	0
WD	10159	And if any part of that made no sense , just point it out . 	0
WD	10160	I think putting a 4 year old on kindergarten is more about the parents need to prove how superior their child is than it is about what is best for the child Or , more likely , it ' s a low to middle income parent , and they ' d rather send the child to school than pay for another year of daycare while they work . 	0
WD	10161	Neither of these scenarios were true for me . 	0
WD	10162	My daughter had a late August birthday and a Sept 1 cutoff . 	0

WD	10164	As the morality of our society crashes , so , too , does the level of morality and level of education in our public schools . 	0
WD	10165	The evidence wasn â t very good then for a gap between the genders â learning styles so significant that it would mandate separate instruction , and it hasn â t gotten any better . 	0
WD	10166	Of course there are psychological and intellectual differences between men and women , but meta-analyses of the best studies show that those differences are relatively small , that there is a great deal of variability among individuals , and that , as the neuroscientist Lise Eliot writes , â fundamentally , men and women are more similar than different . â 	0
WD	10167	The best lawyers tend to make the most money . 	0
WD	10168	Men were hardwired for sleeping around and math , women for monogamy and English . 	0
WD	10169	Most people didn â t know much about brain science , but that didn â t stop them from trotting out vaguely recalled findings based on a handful of M . R . I . s showing that men and women thought differently . 	0
WD	10170	In one way , the fashion in single-sex classrooms has not changed at all . 	0
WD	10171	â Math class is tough ! â as that infamous talking Barbie complained . 	0
WD	10172	I remembered all this last week when I read about a new trend toward single-sex classrooms . 	0
WD	10173	Only about a dozen public schools were trying them in 2002 , but since the Department of Education relaxed its rules on gender-segregated classrooms , in 2006 , about five hundred public schools across the country have adopted them , according to an A . P . story . 	0
WD	10174	In May , the A . C . L . U . sent cease-and-desist letters to school districts in Alabama , Maine , Mississippi , West Virginia , and Virginia that have been separating boys and girls for academic instruction . 	0
WD	10175	Any personal experiences to share ? 	0
WD	10176	What do you think about kindergarten redshirting ? 	0
WD	10177	A lot of the academic stuff evens itself out by 3rd grade . 	0
WD	10178	Some kids take longer to learn subjects and it doesn â t necessarily mean they â re less smart than , say , kids who learned to read a year earlier . 	0
WD	10179	My child goes to public school , and if the school starts to suck then guess what I ' ll send her to private school to get a better education Because sometimes you just can ' t fix stupid ! 	1
WD	10180	If my daughters can be in an environment that celebrates girls as intelligent , creative individuals , without the boy craziness ( and reducing of one ' s self to something befitting a boy ' s attention ) , than I will take it . 	0
WD	10181	No , you are not a " bad " person if you send your kids to private school . 	0
WD	10182	Most public schools cannot handle really " bright " kids . 	0
WD	10183	This is especially true at the elementary school level where they have to teach to the middle at best and the lower achieving kids most of the time . 	0
WD	10184	Why ? 	0
WD	10185	They have to teach to the test , so their focus is making sure their kids will pass the standardized tests that are given . 	0
WD	10186	Kids that are really bright , quick learners , etc . get bored and in a lot of cases start acting up . 	0
WD	10187	It â s available as an mp3 as well as manuscript on the Message Downloads page of ChurchandCulture . org . 	0
WD	10188	And if you want to know how much our children are at risk in terms of peer relationships , the media and more -- and how active parenting must be in our day -- please get hold of â The Under Protective Parent â series . 	0
WD	10189	Homeschooling is one of the ways we can fight back . 	0
WD	10190	He would have been bored going over the same things and not getting challenged . 	0
WD	10191	We live in a day of under-protective parenting . 	0
WD	10192	It â s what lets you pick their friends and control the nature , speed and context of their broader socialization . 	0
WD	10193	It â s what lets you insulate them from the world before their maturity is ready to engage it on their own . 	0
WD	10194	It â s what allows you to optimally shape their spiritual life , and pour into it without contest during those years when there should be no contest . 	0
WD	10195	I hope and pray and that every parent will consider homeschooling their child at least through the most pivotal years , which to my thinking , is late elementary and middle school years . 	0
WD	10196	I cannot say this strongly enough . 	0
WD	10197	We had to have a GED or a degree from a correspondence school . 	0
WD	10198	Having multiple inclusion kids in a classroom can slow a class down . 	0
WD	10199	A little flexibility like that is fine but I think it would be easy to go over board . 	0
WD	10200	I have sent my son to private schools so that he could avoid the negative elements of society . 	0
WD	10201	Homeschool was very different when I was in school . 	0
WD	10202	What a waste of time and money and takes a very short view of life long goals of independence . . 	0
WD	10203	I ' m dumbfounded these parents would deny their children an education - or one that is so insufficient they require three years of remedial-college to simply be able to attend another 4 year university . 	0
WD	10204	It wouldn ' t work anyhow . 	0
WD	10205	We â re working on such things and , in recent weeks , I â ve noticed a ton of positive changes in Ryan . 	0
WD	10206	A recent survey in Ghana found that of 450 children enrolled in low-cost , private schools , 449 were previously enrolled in government-subsidised schools â those schools that will now suffer as a result of poor investment . 	0
WD	10207	Yet there is a consistent failure on the part of local authorities and government reviews to grasp even the basis of the ideas that can underlie a different kind of education . 	0
WD	10208	Evidence including our own suggests strongly that this kind of education prepares children to enter further and higher education , or the workforce â and offers them the freedom to learn in the ways that suit them best . 	0
WD	10209	We have half-a-year which means A LOT can change before kindergarten ( besides , since when did kids have to be perfect for kindergarten ? ) . 	0
WD	10210	It is here that home educators have their strongest reservations . 	0
WD	10211	And , most insidious of all , if the law were changed , social workers and education professionals would presumably be expected to monitor the quality of education provided . 	0
WD	10212	Research by ourselves at the University of London ' s Institute of Education has shown how diverse individual learners are , and therefore the diversity of ways in which their needs can best be met . 	0
WD	10213	Education at home is nothing like education at school . 	1
WD	10214	Styles of education can change between children and over time , bringing a flexibility and dynamism that would be impossible in a formal setting . 	0
WD	10215	Home education can range from the highly structured , based on set curriculums and lessons , to the completely informal . 	0
WD	10216	That school should be the benchmark against which all education is measured is resented by many home educators . 	0
WD	10217	While officials talk the language of individualism and chances for everybody , home educators are in a position to deliver precisely that kind of tailor-made education . 	0
WD	10218	After more than 25 years of severe moral decline is it not time to repent , reverence the name of the Lord , reinstitute and keep the third commandment ? 	0
WD	10219	I believe everyone deserves an education , and much more than the 12 years we get , but I also believe I have a choice to do what I feel is best for my children ! 	0
WD	10220	As a matter of fact , as a homeowner , I am supporting both systems , much more than those less fortunate can . 	0
WD	10221	You actively , with forethought , work to deny your child an education ? 	0
WD	10222	Just a thought - the way it works in my community is REAL ESTATE TAXES fund our public schools . 	0
WD	10223	Therefore I am not taking ANYTHING away from the public school system by sending my sons to private school . 	0
WD	10224	It would be silly to sacrifice him to public schools to make them better . 	0
WD	10225	In recent years , the biggest gains in education occurred when governments eliminated user fees to deliver on the right to education , leading to tens of millions of children enrolling in school for the first time , and supporting low-cost private schools mocks the importance of that evidence . 	0
WD	10226	It comes from 2 Chronicles 7 : 14 which is summarized as â If we pray , seek , turn ; then God hears , forgives , heals . â 	0
WD	10227	As I moved from middle school into high school , my friends moved from homeschool to public school . 	0
WD	10228	* He â s in the 90th percentile for height and weight so he runs no risk of being picked on for smallness . 	0
WD	10229	The article is written from the professor ' s perspective and he writes about his experience in teaching Jonas and some of the issues that he felt Jonas dealt with in the class . 	0
WD	10230	In the article , the professor describes the first day of class and how Jonas asked him if there would be a paper required for the course in which the professor responded that was how the previous course was taught and that he would solicit the thoughts of the class and he noticed how Jonas ' demeanor changed with his answer . 	0
WD	10231	Granted , public education , like most other government programs , is corrupt at it ' s core and an administrative nightmare , it needs to be completely overhauled , but the fact remains that the populace needs to be educated and if not forced by law , a lot of parents simply wouldn ' t bother , paying for their kid ' s education gets in the way of the new car and the designer jeans . 	1
WD	10232	If you come out on the other side deficient , it â s hard to make up for that . 	0
WD	10233	There are many elements that come into play when mainstreaming special education students into regular education settings . 	0
WD	10234	Teachers will need to educate themselves so they can learn different strategies to teach two diverse groups , exceptional students and " regular " students , in the same classroom . 	0
WD	10235	The inclusive classroom is different in that the individualized styles of learning and needs of the students fall outside the normal parameter . 	0
WD	10236	Sometimes it is not only the teacher that is resistant but the exceptional students as well are resistant to the change in educational setting because they are used to being separated from the mainstream of school life . 	0
WD	10237	This is where teamwork will become important between the school , the students , and the teachers . 	0
WD	10238	The inclusive classroom is a different dynamic so everyone will have to adjust but the transition will be easier with cooperation from everyone . 	0
WD	10239	I read an article on a particular student named Jonas , a previous special education high school student , and his experience in a college setting . 	0
WD	10240	Jonas is presently a special education assistant or para-professional in a urban high school and he is taking the undergraduate course , Critical Issues in School , to complete his degree . 	0
WD	10241	Second , special education students typically have some modifications or accommodations written in their Individualized Education Plan . 	0
WD	10242	For a special education student , this is magnified tremendously . 	0
WD	10243	Traditional students also try to refrain from asking questions in class because they don ' t want to look dumb . 	0
WD	10244	I say that because I love my country and it really bothers me to see our politicians drag us down further and further in to the abyss . 	0
WD	10245	When classes are filled with 36 to 40 students per class , one-on-one instruction becomes impossible . 	0
WD	10246	In addition , special education students tend to need more one-on-one instruction without distractions . 	0
WD	10247	This means that the students choose to take the test in class â and have attention drawn to them because they get special treatment in other students eyes â or they take their test in the testing center where they can have more privacy . 	0
WD	10248	Oftentimes , their plan allows them to use notes , a calculator and / or textbooks on tests . 	0
WD	10249	I pay taxes that go to the local school system that my children don ' t attend on both my residential property and business properties and I pay the private school tuition . 	0
WD	10250	And as a parent of two " youngest in the class " , I wonder if these redshirt parents ' choice will be subjecting other children , who ' s parents followed the rules , to a school life of struggling to keep up with classmates that should actually be in another class ? 	0
WD	10251	I have always taken time to help as many students as possible , both traditional and special education students . 	0
WD	10252	Lastly , special education teachers catch on quickly which traditional teachers are going to take the time to help the kids on their case load . 	0
WD	10253	Redshirting - does it really buy your child a long-term advantage in school and in life ? 	0
WD	10254	We choose to be the primary influence in our children â s life and know it is the right decision for our family . 	0
WD	10255	In fact , the National Home Education Research Institute disclosed that the 36 to 54 hours that students spend in school-related weekly activities make peers and adults outside of the home the primary influences in children ' s lives - not the parents . 	0
WD	10256	But lack of socialization for homeschoolers is really just a myth that holds no weight and is not a valid reason to not consider homeschooling . 	0
WD	10257	Each parent and family must make the decision to do what is best for them whether it be public school or homeschool . 	0
WD	10258	Mr . Safer also failed to examine the long-term effects of redshirting on children as the proceed thru their academic life . 	0
WD	10259	I sure hope somebody is out there studying these old , bigger , more mature students as they progress thru their school years ? 	0
WD	10260	I was all alone my freshmen year , by my senior year , there were enough high school homeschoolers to count on two hands . 	0
WD	10261	I think the best way to get Public schools to be better and for the system to be fairer is for parents to be given vouchers for the amount public schools would receive for your child ' s education and for the parents to have a choice of where to send their children . 	0
WD	10262	I think that where inclusion is being considered , it has to be carefully planned to meet the childÂs needs . 	0
WD	10263	Just because the vast majority of home educators are good , loving and decent parents cannot mean that the few children at risk *must* be ignored to give you all privacy . 	0
WD	10264	The subjects were deemed too difficult to teach at home . 	0
WD	10265	Public schools will never get better until they have competition . 	0
WD	10266	so my kids should suffer for the school systems down fall while we figure it out . . . . news flash change takes time and you only have kids in school for a short time . . . . 	0
WD	10267	I wish . 	0
WD	10268	No one is claiming " the professionals " are the only ones who can teach . 	0
WD	10269	Teachers in schools are also subject to intrusive checks , the assumption that they would abuse a child as soon as look at them and constant surveillance . 	0
WD	10270	I will always be happy they were happy there , despite my misery . 	0
WD	10271	And so children die . 	0
WD	10272	If no one is checking up , no one has noticed their child ' s bruises and withdrawal and misery . 	0
WD	10273	So , some parents take their children out of school and abuse them so they do not get caught . 	0
WD	10274	What this is about is when a child is being abused by parents , teachers notice and they report it . 	0
WD	10275	It is just a Get of Jail Free card to a very small minority of people . 	0
WD	10276	It is not a widespread problem , no one is claiming that . 	0
WD	10277	There is no way to tell who any of us would have been different without having the experience . 	0
WD	10278	Public schools have failed at their purpose because they have lost their purpose . 	0
WD	10279	Comes up in conversation ? 	0
WD	10280	I don ' t hide it . 	0
WD	10281	" they want to put her in G&T " -- now seriously , it ' s not jealousy - my ODD is identified gifted and I don ' t brag to the world about it . 	0
WD	10282	It ' s our deal . 	0
WD	10283	Got one friend who held her kid back in K because she was immature ( August birthday ) . 	0
WD	10284	Now she ' s in 2nd and all I hear is " she ' s so smart " " she ' s bored . " 	0
WD	10285	But this holding them back because they are immature ? 	1
WD	10286	No way - not a good reason IMO . . . because they will grow up , , they will mature . 	1
WD	10287	Also has anyone considered that maybe the reason many " redshirted " kids to not do as well academically is because their parents waited a year to start them because they did not feel they were ready and maybe they are just not academic performers . 	0
WD	10288	I ' m all for redshirting kids who are not academically ready . 	0
WD	10289	Nope , public school not for me ! 	1
WD	10290	Who in their right mind would want their children to have to rely on an education from one of those to prepare them for life ? 	0
WD	10291	You ' ve got to be kidding . 	0
WD	10292	The public school system the way it is now is not an option . 	1
WD	10293	Plus , I live in a right wing state whose legislators take books out of libraries on religious grounds and who tried to remove teaching the theory of evolution . 	0
WD	10294	This is still a country where your successes do provide some benefits . 	0
WD	10295	Education is one . 	0
WD	10296	I hope that the government doesn ' t make that impossible to . 	0
WD	10297	Just look at public schools . 	0
WD	10298	If you want what is best for your child , you ' ll send them to a private school . 	1
WD	10299	I think the idea that sending all children to public schools is a poor way to bring public education up to grade . 	0
WD	10300	Most would say , not at the expense of my child , and they would be right . 	0
WD	10301	The entire socialist mentality has no place here in the United States . 	0
WD	10302	I am going to be starting a single sex school but am not intimidated by this at all , as it was not just my parents choice but mine too , alot of people I know quite well go there and enjoy it tremendisly . 	0
WD	10303	Its just a debate that has two extremely good arguments on both sides 	0
WD	10304	Not sure how it would have turned out if we ' d sent him straight through , but I can attest that he is a leader in all things he does â athletically , professionally , and socially . 	0
WD	10305	Testimony : My son , now 25 , was held back by going to Transitional first grade ( T1 ) . 	0
WD	10306	I believe that his going the T1 route was a part of what worked for us . 	0
WD	10307	He was awarded a full athletic college scholarship ; voted captain of his team by his teammates for three years , and earned another scholarship to get his masters ; and had several generous job offers to choose from upon graduating . 	0
WD	10308	I know it ' s a tough decision to make â best of luck to those trying to make the decision , I know its tough and is different for each child . 	0
WD	10309	I am a loving , knowledgeable , intelligent and successful individual that wants to do all that I can to prepare my children and give them a great life . 	0
WD	10310	These parents are paying for public schools as well with tax dollars . 	0
WD	10311	People sending their kids to private schools and homeschooling actual helps the public schools . 	0
WD	10312	By helping pay for it , but not sending their children there , they are increasing the amount of funds that are available per student . 	0
WD	10313	Constitutionally , Canada has no religion , although some mistakenly believe we are a Christian nation even though legally that argument has no ground . 	0
WD	10314	Lets keep it that way . 	0
WD	10315	There is no place for religion in schools nor should taxpayers subsidize any religion ' s prayer services . 	1
WD	10316	I do not care if the person is Christian , Muslim , Jewish , Hindu , Zorastrian , Buddhist , Jainist , Wiccan , Protestant , Catholic , Orthodox , or Pagan their beliefs belong in premises financed by their believers not the government . 	0
WD	10317	My decision was based solely on those points as found by our exhaustive research of what was available to us in our area . 	0
WD	10318	Allowing prayer in schools leads to prosetylization and that is unacceptable . 	0
WD	10319	Nobody needs to be practicing religion at a public school . 	1
WD	10320	The whole point is to separate education from religion . 	0
WD	10321	If you want your kid learning and praying in the same place then send them to a religious school . 	0
WD	10322	if you had to do something and be child free during that time , the munchkins went to gramma or the teenage girl 3 doors down the block . 	0
WD	10323	your kid turned 5 , you sent them to KINDERGARTEN , boom , done . 	0
WD	10324	too often , parents are doing it because it ' s the done thing now , not because they have any sense that it will actually benefit their child ; someone said it was a good idea , so they did it . we didn ' t put our daughter in day care , pre-school , or 4K ; ppl thought we were nuts . 	0
WD	10325	now , parents do all this crap to give their kids a leg up , get them ahead of their peers , send them to umpteen different activities , get them in pre-school , and now this redshirting thing . 	0
WD	10326	dept . on the cheap , the dance classes , soccer , softball , on and on ad nauseum . 	0
WD	10327	this idea that kids need just one more year to be a kid . . . perhaps for some parents , there ' s some truth to it . when i was a kid , back in the dark ages , there wasn ' t day care , pre-school , 4 year old kindergarten , we didn ' t have all these things kids can do via the rec . 	0
WD	10328	there wasn ' t even the designation of 5K ; there was just KINDERGARTEN . 	0
WD	10329	when i was a kid , i was allowed to be a kid until kindergarten , where my mother had the choice of half day or full day kindergarten . 	0
WD	10330	There are many religions that do not pray to their gods , and some that don ' t have any gods whatsoever . 	0
WD	10331	2 ) The 1st amendment clearly establishes ( heh heh get it ) that the government may not sponsor a religion . 	0
WD	10332	One of the biggest myths about homeschooled kids is that they are poorly socialized . 	0
WD	10333	A study by the Canadian Center for Home Education found homeschooled young people at 15-34 years of age more socially engaged ( 67% ) compared with their public school educated peers ( 44% ) . 	0
WD	10334	It ' s not . 	0
WD	10335	4 ) It forces children to think that religion is okay . 	0
WD	10336	Prayer is solely religious in nature . 	0
WD	10337	3 ) Not only that , but the 1st amendment has been interpreted to mean that the government may not sponsor religion in general . 	0
WD	10338	I found it fascinating that homeschooled children , who are not being taught to the test , on the whole do much better than their public school counterparts . 	0
WD	10339	The statistics showing the higher test scores may be skewed because parents of homeschooled kids are not required to take or report scores for standardized tests in many states . 	0
WD	10340	Homeschooled students do have more time to pursue extracurricular activities as opposed to their exhausted public school peers . 	0
WD	10341	Teachers teach to the test because that is what they are instructed to do by administrations that are under pressure for government funding . 	0
WD	10342	Some parents bring in tutors or enroll their children in enrichment programs driving up the cost . 	0
WD	10343	Many parents recycle curriculum among siblings , get groups together for the group rate when visiting museums , and get free materials from the library or online to cut costs . 	0
WD	10344	In public school everyone must take standardized tests and schools must report the scores . 	0
WD	10345	The cost of homeschooling varies widely . 	0
WD	10346	It really is that simple . 	0
WD	10347	But the state ( including the public schools ) cannot mandate , sponsor , conduct , or otherwise officially sanction prayer . 	1
WD	10348	Private individuals can pray whenever and wherever they want ; no one â s personal freedoms are being abridged in this regard . 	1
WD	10349	( They can â t even offer to lead purely â voluntary â prayers with an â opt out â option for non-praying students ; that â s still a form of religious participation and support , on an official basis , by the state â which is flatly unconstitutional ) . 	0
WD	10350	Ergo , public schools ( e . g . , the state ) may not lead or conduct prayers . 	0
WD	10351	U . S . public schools , being government-run and taxpayer-supported , are part of â the state . â 	0
WD	10352	The state may not establish , endorse , promote , sponsor , or conduct prayers . 	0
WD	10353	Individuals may freely exercise their religion of choice , and give free expression to their own private religious preferences ; however , the state cannot do likewise ( because the U . S . Constitution also mandates that the state may not promote , endorse , or otherwise â establish â religion ) . 	0
WD	10354	However , teachers on duty in public schools are not acting as private individuals , but as employees ( and hence representatives ) of the state . 	0
WD	10355	It is sometimes objected that teachers â rights of religious expression and free speech are being violated , if they are forbidden to lead students in prayer . 	0
WD	10356	However , when they want to pray out loud or with a group , I consider that a disruption and therefore not acceptable . 	0
WD	10357	While one child may be an extreme extrovert and need to be surrounded by students and in a classroom , another may be an extreme introvert , overwhelmed and anxious in the classroom . 	0
WD	10358	The private and Catholic schools were grew out of the need created because the public schools sucked " first " . 	0
WD	10359	If the failing public schools were to suddenly get better because the parents whose kids are ' stuck ' there demanded better , likely the parents of private school kids would put their kids back in public schools . 	0
WD	10360	If the problems could be solved by more involved parents ( and a majority of them probably can be ) , then put the onus on the remaining parents to rise up and get more involved . 	0
WD	10361	You ' re blaming people who choose to walk away in disgust ( often while paying tax money ANYWAY to subsidize failure ) yet ignoring the obvious . 	0
WD	10362	IF this were true , then why don ' t the parents whose kids ARE in the public school system work to improve it ? 	0
WD	10363	They deserve better . 	0
WD	10364	If the atmosphere in the school is right , if the pastoral care excellent than I feel that the co-ed environment creates a vibrant , exciting , stimulating school but also a more relaxed and less stressful climate . 	0
WD	10365	As a boy in a boarding school myself many years ago , which was single sex until A levels , the arrival of girls in the sixth form was the worst possible distraction to teenage boys about to embark serious exams . 	0
WD	10366	Girls also feel the pressure of exam much more than boys and in their teenage years exam pressure can become very intense with often very serious negative consequences . 	0
WD	10367	My experience in a secondary co-ed is that the co-ed situation does deflect some of this tension . 	0
WD	10368	But in my opinion it should be from 2-18 . 	0
WD	10369	Boys and girls perhaps learn differently and approach work in different ways . 	0
WD	10370	If a school is aware of this and teachers can adapt styles and vary their teaching strategies â I see co-eds as both a more natural and realistic preparation for the fast approaching lesson of adult life . 	1
WD	10371	This can cause children to not experience as much about society and those different from them as they would in a public or private school setting . 	0
WD	10372	Experiences are left out of childhood that could have been gained through attendance at school in a multicultural classroom . 	0
WD	10373	Finances Finances can be difficult for families when children are homeschooled . 	0
WD	10374	With one parent teaching children in the comfort of your own home , the other is left to be sole " breadwinner , " and that can place a burden on a family ' s budget . 	0
WD	10375	Many schools also provide a free lunch to students in order to aid families during this tough economic time , something that cannot be offered while homeschooling . 	0
WD	10376	Isolation from Differences Children are isolated from differences in race , ethnicity , age and culture when being homeschooled . 	0
WD	10377	Ideally , I don â t think school children should spend as much time as they usually do isolated by age , let alone sex . 	1
WD	10378	The unhealthiest social situations I was ever in were an all-boys school and military training . 	0
WD	10379	In a rough analogy to monocultural farming , I think than any highly homogeneous group of people , while it offers certain efficiencies , is inherently pathology prone . 	0
WD	10380	Diversity damps extremes of outlook , need and behavior . 	0
WD	10381	She compares the push toward mainstreaming students from special education classes to the 1980s movement to downsize mental health institutes , which resulted in an increase in homelessness because individuals could no long receive needed supports . 	0

WD	10384	Lesson plans ( and the national curriculum ) are the death of real education . 	0
WD	10385	Others may differ , but I always think , isn â t high school supposed to transition you into the world , college , and life on your own ? 	0
WD	10386	Girls were said to be hitting a self-esteem barrier in junior high , when they would droop like Ophelias in need of reviving . 	0
WD	10387	The reformers â talk was all about â How Schools Shortchange Girls â ( the title of a much-discussed report from the American Association of University Women ) or were â Failing at Fairness â ( the title of a 1994 book ) for young women . 	0
WD	10388	My view on the subject is no . 	1
WD	10389	and I actually do feel like co-ed schools develop a girl better socially and emotionally than all-girls schools , just from the mere fact that a girl will get to interact with boys on a daily basis . 	0
WD	10390	As Halpern and her co-authors point out , there are some excellent single-sex programs , and some can point to real gains , but often these can be attributed to selection biasâthe children involved were more committed studentsâand to the motivation and sense of mission among teachers and staff . 	0
WD	10391	In an article called , bluntly , â The Pseudoscience of Single-Sex Schooling , â which was co-authored by Diane Halpern , a research psychologist at Claremont McKenna college , and published in Science magazine this fall , Halpern et al . conclude that â there is no well-designed research showing that single-sex education improves students â academic performance . â 	0
WD	10392	A woman whose daughters attend one of the West Virginia middle schools with boys â and girls â classes contributed an article this week to the A . C . L . U . Web site in which she pointed out that her school â s all-male classes operated on the humane assumption that many kids concentrate better if they â re permitted to move about a bit . 	0
WD	10393	When I was reporting on single-sex education experiments in the nineties , one of the things I noticed was that teaching methods enthusiastically billed as better for girls , like hands-on science demonstrations , or mixing word problems in with more standard equations , would be better for anyone without a natural bent for math or science . 	0
WD	10394	She thought , reasonably enough , that some girls might benefit from a little of the same freedom . 	0
WD	10395	In the boys â classes , students could lounge in beanbag chairs and run around outside sometimes to â blow off steam . â 	0
WD	10396	In the nineties , it was girls . 	0
WD	10397	What has changed since the nineties is the notion of who single-sex education is supposed to help most . 	0
WD	10398	We should make the public system as good as possible for those who can ' t afford it but if parents want their kids to get a better education than the system provides don ' t stop them . 	0
WD	10399	I went to a private school and the public system could never have given me the same experience and quality education . 	0

WD	10401	He enjoys his preschool activities but if he had to do everything over again , I envision lots of fussing about going to school . 	0
WD	10402	Mornings would be ugly . 	0
WD	10403	Besides , the biggest detriment of preschool boredom is associating disinterest with school . 	0
WD	10404	No one wants a kid to develop the habit of tuning out . 	0
WD	10405	Ryan also is like me in that he â s observant and listening intensely , although if you didn â t know him , or me , you might think we â re not paying attention . 	0
WD	10406	But trust me , we have mentally filed away every detail of interest and can almost recite word-for-word what was said . 	0
WD	10407	Here â s another thing : A bored Ryan is trouble waiting to happen . 	0
WD	10408	I cannot imagine him spending a year not moving forward with his learning . 	0
WD	10409	They pay most , if not all of the taxes that support the socialistic schools . 	0
WD	10410	Just who do you think pays for the schools ? 	0
WD	10411	A very few excel , but they are the type who would have exceled even without schooling , so they exceled in spite of public schools . 	0
WD	10412	I went to both single sex and co-ed high schools , and I feel the later made it easier to build cross gender friendships that weren ' t just hormone driven . 	0
WD	10413	I believe that envy is one of the carnal sins . 	0
WD	10414	It ' d be good to read up on the literature . 	0
WD	10415	My first thoughts are that it would be more likely to produce an objectified view even with regular cross school events . 	0
WD	10416	Yes , private school is expensive but not every parent that sends their kid to private school is well to do . 	0
WD	10417	My husband and I both work and make good money , but allowing him to go to private school took some thought in regards to our budget . 	0
WD	10418	I suggest reading a blog I wrote earlier this year titled â Parents , Sports and Church . â 	0
WD	10419	All I would add to its words would be that as someone who played competitive sports himself at almost every level , and saw my homeschooled kids engage them at almost every level as well , it â s a red herring . 	0
WD	10420	I have two children . 	0

WD	10425	My son who at the end of his Freshman year had a GPA of 3 . 8 excelled as well but he was stressed out for 90% of the year because of the classroom sizes . 	0
WD	10426	He would come home so frustrated because the teacher spent most of the class trying to get everyone to focus and pay attention that by the time the bell rang to go to the next class they were left to figure out the lesson for the day on their own or go to tutoring after school which is what he would do . 	0
WD	10427	Others may feel they are not qualified or temperamentally suited to the task . 	0

WD	10438	Please stop , reverse your decision and realize that religion , all religions , have no use in our education system , our government and technically speaking ( even those whom are dedicated to their faith ) 98% of the hours with a calendar year . 	1
WD	10439	Our daughter barely made the age cut-off for kindergarten ( late summer birthday ) , but against our better judgement we started her anyway . 	0
WD	10440	these few children who are really JUST not ready for prime time , maybe i can see it , IF these kids are doing something to help them in w / e area they are lacking , but to do it for sports , or just because they need that one extra year to " just be a kid " ? 	0
WD	10441	no . 	0

WD	10443	If Muslims are required by their religion to pray several ( is it 6 ? ) times a day , and this space is being allotted so the Muslim youth can practice their religion properly . . . why is this prayer only being conducted once per week ? 	0
WD	10444	This timetable would seem in opposition of what their faith demands . 	0
WD	10445	I am convinced more satisfaction is gained from the fact that they will be allowed to halfheartedly practice their faith in a public school rather than actually practicing their faith properly an a place of worship . 	0
WD	10446	And boo hiss on any Canadian institution that would allow discrimination against gender to be practiced on tax-payer funded property . 	0
WD	10447	She is repeating 3rd grade this year and is having a much better time of it , not just academically , but also socially . 	0
WD	10448	The school was reluctant to retain her and told us this was rarely done , but we know this was the best decision we ever could have made . 	1
WD	10449	They have since then transitioned into public schools and ( from my distant vantage point ) seem to be doing fine . 	0
WD	10450	With solemn oaths and binding contracts between individuals removed , the state eventually sits where God ought , and only the state â s cause is held valid . 	0

WD	10480	I highly recommend a co-ed school . 	1
WD	10481	With the voucher system in place public schools will forced to compete for the same money , hence public school will be forced to improve the way they preform ! 	0
WD	10482	However , voluntary , non-disruptive , silent prayer is fine . 	1

WD	10503	I ' m happy with my choice and it was comforting to read this article of support for my decision . 	1
WD	10504	Take two things from this on your quest to become a better person : 1 ) Your child will probably do just fine without â the best , â so don â t freak out too much , but 2 ) do freak out a little more than my parents didâenough to get involved . 	0
WD	10505	( Can you imagine ? ) 	0

WD	10511	In reality , children and teens are locked behind gates on campus , are segregated by age , are forced to remain silent in class unless called by the teacher , and whose schedules are determined by the blare of school bells . 	0
WD	10512	In contrast , a homeschooler â s â classroom â is the world around him / her . 	0
WD	10513	Parents don â t just limit teaching their children in the living or dining room . 	0
WD	10514	They hold lessons in parks , libraries or museums . 	0
WD	10515	However , Dr . Thomas Smedley debunked these assumptions when he did a study on homeschooled kids . 	0
WD	10516	Last year , his pre-school teacher recommended that I hold him back and keep him in Pre-K one more year . 	0
WD	10517	Homeschooled children scored very high in the 84th percentile compared to public school students who scored at an abysmal 23rd percentile . 	0
WD	10518	Public schools argue that their kids are better socialized . 	0
WD	10519	Pre-K was only 3 hours long , while Kindergarten was a full day . 	0
WD	10520	They take weekly field trips to places of interest in the community , including churches , colleges , hospitals , fire departments , city halls , and even repair shops . 	0
WD	10521	Indeed , parents ensure that their kids are able to interact with people of all ages , and not just with their peers . 	0
WD	10522	If you want to chat with your invisible , supernatural friend do so off school property and on your own time . 	0
WD	10523	Our education system ( as with our government ) must remain secular and free from these silly distractions . 	0
WD	10524	NO PRAYER IN SCHOOLS ! . . . period . 	1
WD	10525	While there are many arguments for homeschooling children , there are several reasons that parents might not want to pursue this educational option . 	0
WD	10526	This large step should be considered carefully before children are either homeschooled or enrolled at a public institution . 	0
WD	10527	Homeschooling allows children to move at their own learning pace , yet it can socially isolate them . 	0
WD	10528	Homeschooling is beneficial for some , but may not be right for every family . 	0
WD	10529	Also , teaching itself can be difficult , as parents usually haven ' t earned a degree in education and occasionally they don ' t even have any kind of post-secondary education . 	0
WD	10530	Social Networks Children who are homeschooled can lack the social interaction gained by having classmates . 	0
WD	10531	Teaching Many parents find the variety of choices and lesson plans that can be used for homeschooling overwhelming . 	0
WD	10532	Since there are no laid out plans for teaching , homeschooling can be a great deal of work for parents , and occasionally confusing for children . 	0
WD	10533	This can be difficult for children as they can be socially isolated unless parents create their own social groups through sports , extracurricular activities or religious organizations . 	0
WD	10534	The value of learning how to get along with others and develop social skills that will be needed throughout life is an important part of the education experience . 	0
WD	10535	My child changes every year and so will his needs . 	1
WD	10536	So bored ! 	0
WD	10537	NONE . 	0
WD	10538	I can ' t imagine tossing them into PreK again for another year . 	0
WD	10539	They would be so bored . 	0
WD	10540	My kids would be bored to tears in Kindergarten if we waited a year . 	0
WD	10541	As it is they already enter Kindy grade level comfortable in 1st grade math / 1-2nd grade reading level . 	0
WD	10542	I have seen it from all angles and am now seeing it from the parent ' s angle . 	1
WD	10543	Actually , my son had a homeschooled boy on his hockey team for several years . 	0
WD	10544	Home educated children are also more involved in their communities , as are adults who were homeschooled . 	0
WD	10545	The top reason my friends say they didn â t consider homeschooling is because they are sure their kids won â t listen to them . 	0
WD	10546	He socialized just fine and was exceptionally bright , though judging from his fascination with my garage door opener , seemed a bit sheltered . 	0
WD	10547	Many readers addressed this saying it â s a matter of discipline and good parenting . 	0
WD	10548	I have to say , I â m with them . 	0
WD	10549	Someone out there should start a consulting business teaching parents how to get their kids to listen to them while homeschooling . 	0
WD	10550	Although there is a huge homeschool community out there that makes it work , I still can â t imagine my boys cooperating . 	0
WD	10551	Christian prayer in schools is not a problem because the Christian holy day of the week is Sunday - a day when there is no school . 	0
WD	10552	He went in a boy and came out a god-loving man of character ! 	0
WD	10553	The subject of homeschool shouldn ' t open a firestorm of debate anymore than mentioning a child is going to public school opens a debate . 	0
WD	10554	This is after all a free country . 	0
WD	10555	It depends on what you think a Christian is . 	0
WD	10556	There are too many who try to use the government and our schools to force their religion on everyone . 	0
WD	10557	Not surpirsingly the worst behavior problems are lower potential and high potential students . 	0
WD	10558	But you are free to carry a Bible until you use it to violate the rights of others . 	0
WD	10559	Well , of course the whole Bible isn ' t mythology . 	0
WD	10560	There is some religious laws , there is a lot of poetry , there is some history , and there is a lot of mythology . 	0
WD	10561	How else should Genesis be characterized ? 	0
WD	10562	Nonsense . 	0
WD	10563	As an agent of the government you would be enjoined from giving the appearance that the government endorsed or supported a particular religion . 	0
WD	10564	I believe that there has been case law on the matter in which a teacher was dismissed for putting a Bible on the desk . 	0
WD	10565	Carry it in your brief case , but to take it out and place it promenently on the desk every day crosses the line . 	0
WD	10566	My child went to a private all boys school and it was the best thing I ever did ! 	1
WD	10567	As a teacher , this is a moral and ethical struggle for me . 	0
WD	10568	In public school , the parents nor the teachers have too much say in the government run institutions ! 	0
WD	10569	I don ' t know if I agree that a parent has to be super organized , so much as motivated . 	0
WD	10570	( though organization does help . ) 	0
WD	10571	This is why I work to support my family rather than work to support a random group of my fellow human beings . 	0
WD	10572	Ergo , if I have kids that I love and I live in a place with a crappy school district , you ' re damn right I ' m going to put them in a private school if I ' m able to do it . 	1
WD	10573	I ' m not going to ship them off to some crappy public just so I can use them as a tool for making a sociopolitical point . 	0
WD	10574	When preparing for a test , the boys may go for a run , or engage in some other activity , while the girls are more likely to do calming exercises , such as yoga . â 	0
WD	10575	The writer is an idiot . 	0
WD	10576	As a responsible , rational , moral human being , I have a hierarchy of responsibility . 	0
WD	10577	I have a responsibility to my society but I also have a responsibility to my family . 	0
WD	10578	My responsibility to my family trumps my responsibility to society . 	0
WD	10579	I â m not saying it â s a good thing that I got a lame education . 	0
WD	10580	I think that as a parent you really have to commit to x amount of hours a day HAVE to be designated for school , and it is really easy to be like " Well , we ' ll get back on track tomorrow . " 	0
WD	10581	Girls thrive on team projects and collaboration ; boys on bright lights , loud voices , and competition . 	0
WD	10582	I â m saying that I survived it , and so will your child , who must endure having no AP calculus so that in 25 years there will be AP calculus for all . 	0
WD	10583	This year it may be homeschool . 	1
WD	10584	Isn ' t this an interesting country we live in when we have to justify practicing our religious freedoms ! 	0
WD	10585	In a study conducted by Dr . Michael Mitchell , traits for successful socialization in students include popularity among peers , aggressive competitiveness , pride and self-confidence , and a drive toward materialism . 	0
WD	10586	A second point to consider is that there is an obvious discrepancy between public school educators and homeschoolers on what traits define successful socialization . 	0
WD	10587	It â s amazing how much more emotionally mature a six year old is . 	0
WD	10588	With this in mind I feel it does no harm to wait till he â s six . 	1
WD	10589	You son sounds like he â s much more ready intelligence wise but not emotionally wise . 	0
WD	10590	He wasn â t ready for kindergarten though . 	0
WD	10591	I know my oldest was and it â s just now in the fourth grade that he â s really catching up to his peers . 	0
WD	10592	He sounds like he â s mostly ready , but like you said he would be one of the youngest in his class . 	0
WD	10593	I think you really have to know your own child . 	0
WD	10594	As I stated earlier , mainstream was the right move for me , however I do not regret my time spent in The Court . 	0
WD	10595	To my mind , this is not an issue with a quick fix solution , nor are there any definitive answers on what â s better for disabled children . 	0
WD	10596	This means that teachers can spend more time on each pupil , answering any questions or concerns they may have about the tasks set . 	0
WD	10597	In contrast , homeschoolers want their children to focus on building character and integrity , developing a sense of responsibility , and respect toward others â ideals of Christian living . 	0
WD	10598	So I would argue that all provision for disabled pupils ( and students ) needs defending whether its special schools , SEN ( special education needs ) departments in mainstream schools or learning support assistants . 	0
WD	10599	To that end , the â integration vs . segregation â argument simply becomes an argument that is abstract and separate from reality . 	0
WD	10600	I feel that it is almost certain that â special â education will always be necessary for some school-students and ultimately it is their needs which should form the focus of this debate . 	0
WD	10601	It provided me with the first steps in my education . 	0
WD	10602	I hope disabled people , carers , teachers and parents can consider this possibility the next time this debate arises . 	0
WD	10603	The drift toward private schools was predicted as far back at the mid 1980s when I first became a teacher . 	0
WD	10604	At public it ' s payment in full at private it ' s payment in full or pay the difference . 	0
WD	10605	It was said that a ' voucher system ' would eventually be put in place , where by the funding attached to each student would ' travel ' with the student . 	0
WD	10606	Not surprisingly , delinquent and antisocial behaviors are practically non-existent in homeschooled children . 	0
WD	10607	This meant that the public school funding would be dependent upon demand from the community . 	0
WD	10608	" If he ' s older , he won ' t be easily manipulated into drug use and malpractices like this . 	0
WD	10609	As a publicly educated teacher I was concerned about the genesis of ' schools of last resort ' . 	0
WD	10610	He might feel more confident dealing with older students , " she said . 	0
WD	10611	Just as Gibb made a choice depending on her son ' s emotional needs , Vela recommends that parents do the same . 	0
WD	10612	I don ' t necessarily think that social skills or academics should be a sole deciding factor when figuring out when to start school . 	0
WD	10613	If she was down one grade it wouldn ' t make much difference socially since she is SO far off , but she would be further ahead with academics , totally bored , and would have other issues there as a result . 	0
WD	10614	She is a 13 year-old 8th grader with a fall birthday who is at or above level academically . 	0
WD	10615	If my oldest was in the grade where she fits SOCIALLY she would be in 3rd or 4th . 	0
WD	10616	You will also always have someone at the top and at the bottom when it comes to academics . 	0
WD	10617	It doesn ' t matter what the cut-off date is , there will always be someone who falls into each of those categories whether they are one and the same or not . 	0
WD	10618	Someone always has to be the youngest and someone always has to be the most immature . 	0
WD	10619	Tracy Gibb , a mother , blogger of Less than Perfect , deliberately redshirted her son because she thought he was emotionally immature . 	0
WD	10620	My wife and I also wanted our daughter to receive an education in Christ and that ' s a big reason we sent her to Christian private school . 	0
WD	10621	I often spent 20 mins of each year 9 lesson getting the boys to stop aggravating the ADHD boy , as he would then " blow " , much to the amusement of everyone . 	0
WD	10622	Certain schools by us have opened the doors to ESL , and now every lowlife transfers to the great school and destroys the curriculum at that school . 	0
WD	10623	" When he complains about his friend , I always try to remind him that he is one year younger than him and that he was doing the same things last year , " Gibb told ABCNews . com . 	0
WD	10624	Gibb still thinks she made the right choice not only because her son was " emotionally immature , " but also because she did not want him to join high school or college at a very young age . 	0
WD	10625	GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE EDUCATION PROCESS . 	0
WD	10626	YOU WANT TO FIX THE PATHETIC PUBLIC SCHOOLS . . . . 	0
WD	10627	I guess I choose to be a bad person and go with private schooling . 	1
WD	10628	So lets see I have a choice of sending my kids to a private school ; or better yet of homeschooling them and raising intelligent indivuals who can think for themselves and make intelligent decisions when they become adults or I can send them to public schools and play a role in raising more federal libtard zombies who question nothing and can carry on the torch of the last two generations of people destroying this once great country . 	0
WD	10629	The hell with do they know how to read , write , etc . The question is do you agree with the homosexual agenda , do you 5th graders know how to put on a condom , Christianity is evil but don ' t hurt the sweet people of Isam ' s feeling because after all they are part of the religion of peace . 	0
WD	10630	Should I send my kids to school where they can learn NOT how to READ , WRITE , SPELL , do MATH , SCIENCE , HISTORY , but learn how to think the way the Liberal federal government wants them too . 	0
WD	10631	Lets see here . 	0
WD	10632	Hmmm . . . . 	0
WD	10633	there ' s no social advantage at all ; the best place to learn to be social with kids of all ages is a school ! 	0
WD	10634	there ' s no academic advantage to keeping your kid out of school for an extra year , if all you do is put them in some kind of kiddie college , or if you won ' t or can ' t teach them on your own . 	0
WD	10635	all this pressure i see on other kids , and where ' s the benefit ? 	0
WD	10636	she takes one dance class , 45 minutes every saturday , because she asked if she could , not because i think it ' s good for much of anything ; she likes to dance and maybe she ' ll learn to not be such a clod . 	0
WD	10637	i am in the somewhat , these days , enviable position of being a stay at home mom , and i am a nerdy book worm , so it ' s easy enough for me to fill her time at home with education , and in such a way that she doesn ' t think she ' s being taught , ha ha sneaky mom . 	0
WD	10638	what DO you do , if you hold them back that first year ? 	0
WD	10639	the flip side is the parents who HAVE to put their kids in day care and pre-school , because they both work , and how many of them really find that their kids are SO much better off when they finally start school ? 	0
WD	10640	how many of the redshirted kids have parents who can do that , as opposed to paying for extracurricular programs ? 	0
WD	10641	but , no , i don ' t see it . if you want your kid to just be a kid , DON ' T put them in all these activities , unless they ASK to do them . 	0
WD	10642	i have not found one study that shows any tangible benefit to redshirting , and yes , i have looked , because it made no sense to me when i first heard of it , but i thought maybe there was some validity to the idea just the same . 	0
WD	10643	But , say a classmate has died . 	0
WD	10644	If the government actually spent money on the school system instead of other things that would be different . 	0
WD	10645	If prayer really works , then students might turn to God and come to know His love and forgiveness . 	0
WD	10646	Alliance Defending Freedom stands with See You at the Pole and with every student who desires to call upon the name of God . 	0
WD	10647	My husband helped update plumbing . 	0
WD	10648	If prayer didn â t work , then a group of students gathering around a flagpole early in the morning to talk to God would pose no threat . 	0
WD	10649	If prayer didn â t work , then FFRF would not find it â unfortunate â that students are encouraged to â reach out to [ their ] classmates who do not know God â s love and forgiveness . â 	0
WD	10650	In 2006 , then Education Secretary Margaret Spellings eased federal regulations on the policy , allowing schools to offer single-sex classrooms and schools so as long as these options are completely voluntary . 	0
WD	10651	If prayer really works , then it is a threat to those who would seek to corrupt a generation of students into embracing a godless worldview . 	0
WD	10652	The theme of this year â s See You at the Pole is #IFTHEN . 	0
WD	10653	And during a moment of silence , cannot some students pray and others reflect ? 	0
WD	10654	To FFRF and groups like it , the threat of prayer at school is the â then . â 	0
WD	10655	The threat is that when students pray , then God responds . 	0
WD	10656	The say and decisions are directed by leader of the system who reports to the state education system . . . not to parents . 	0
WD	10657	As such this leaves little room for parental suggestion let alone parental say in the class . 	0
WD	10658	This is where money talks , if you want to make a change or have a say in your child ' s education this will take either you teaching them yourself or paying someone else to teach them the way you believe is best ( private school ) . 	1
WD	10659	The author assumes parents can change a public system . 	0
WD	10660	The flaw . 	0
WD	10661	If it were the ins and outs of the school would be to serve the parents . . it is not it is to serve and teach the children . 	0
WD	10662	This is not so . 	0
WD	10663	This worked really well . 	0
WD	10664	On top of all this , we also paid taxes to the public school . 	0
WD	10665	I think it is really destructive when inclusion fails . 	0
WD	10666	It is better to build up to inclusion gradually where possible . 	0
WD	10667	I can see disallowing vocal prayer . 	1
WD	10668	A school is a public institution . 	0
WD	10669	It might offend some people . 	0
WD	10670	Inconsiderate bigots . 	0
WD	10671	What about the other children who believe in a different religion or have no religion ? 	0
WD	10672	But , of course . 	0
WD	10673	These types of Christians only care about themselves and THEIR beliefs . 	0
WD	10674	To hell with everyone else . 	0
WD	10675	The schools and government seem to think that my children belong to them . 	0
WD	10676	When I went to the schools about my children I was treated like an interloper and talked down to as if I was beneath them . 	0
WD	10677	As with any generalization , there are exceptions to the rule , but this is what I have seen . 	0
WD	10678	First , students with learning disabilities tend to be self conscious of the fact that they have a learning disability . 	0
WD	10679	There are , however , special education students with more severe disabilities who do stay in a different classroom , but those students are few and far between . 	0
WD	10680	Nowadays , special education students are in regular education classes along with everyone else . 	0
WD	10681	Things have changed tremendously since then . 	0
WD	10682	When I was in high school , special education students had their own wing in the school and mostly stayed there for all of their classes . 	0
WD	10683	Here is my experience . 	0
WD	10684	There can be , however , a few road blocks for special education students , parents and teachers . 	0
WD	10685	I have had several of them in my math classes , and they have generally been some of the best students . 	0
WD	10686	I think mainstreaming special education students is wonderful . 	1
WD	10687	For Zach homeschooling meant greater stability . 	0
WD	10688	He seem surprised that I was even going to the University and not the local Junior College to learn a trade and gave me no advise how to achieve it . 	0
WD	10689	In the University , I found out what they didn ' t teach me in high school and I was behind much of the first year . 	0
WD	10690	The idea is that a child needs extra time to catch up , whether physically , academically or emotionally . 	0
WD	10691	He would be one of the youngest kindergartenersâand because of this , I also have the option to hold him back ( or redshirt him ) . 	0
WD	10692	this was 1970 . 	0
WD	10693	Nobody seemed to care what we did . 	0
WD	10694	This is nuts . 	0

WD	10700	My son Ryan turns 5 in May and , under our school district â s cutoff dates , he is eligible to start elementary school this fall . 	0
WD	10701	Like many parents of children with late-spring and summer birthdays , I must decide RIGHT NOW whether my child should begin kindergarten next year or repeat preschool . 	0
WD	10702	In most parts of the country , it â s time to register your 4- and 5-year-olds for kindergarten . 	0
WD	10703	But no matter . 	0
WD	10704	After this period , the brain becomes slowly less plastic and by the time the child reaches adolescence , the brain cannot develop " richly and normally any real cognitive system , including language . " http://www.cal.org/earlylang/benefits/research_notes.html As Larry The Cable Guy would say : " Only in America ! " 	0
WD	10705	These kids need to be prepared for the 21st centuary global economy by being enrolled in a local second language immersion kindergarden as soon as they can enroll . 	0
WD	10706	This is because language acquisition therories tell us that , " there is a window of opportunity in which the child learns that first language normally . 	0

WD	10712	Jesus â teaching on oath-taking recorded in Matthew 5 : 33-37 , while often misinterpreted , is actually a strong affirmation of the third commandment and a clear warning that â the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain â ( Exodus 20 : 7 ) . 	0
WD	10713	Not in Public Schools . 	0
WD	10714	Each and every family has the right to evaluate their child or children and their needs . 	0
WD	10715	I know that there are some very competent and dedicated private school teachers , but in general , how could they outperform public school teachers , who make so much more money ? 	0
WD	10716	Each choice , regardless of your opinion on homeschool or public school , should be respected . 	0
WD	10717	No one knows their child like them and the entire debate of homeschool versus public school is moot , except between mom and dad . 	0
WD	10718	That angle is in choosing what it best for my child this year . 	1
WD	10719	One thing is for sure . 	0
WD	10720	Next year it may be public school . 	1
WD	10721	What are the factors you considered when making this decision for your child ? 	0
WD	10722	I plan to see how that age assortment goes for him as it may mirror what we will encounter in kindergarten . 	0
WD	10723	This coming year of preschool instead of being in a traditional 3 â² s classroom , he will be in a young 4 â² s room that ranges from 3 1 / 2 to 4 1 / 2 . 	0
WD	10724	Taken together , the risk of Leo becoming bored outweighs any concerns I have about him socially . 	0
WD	10725	In some ways being surrounded by older kids is much easier because they tend to be more prosocial and they model social skills from which Leo can benefit . 	0
WD	10726	But , at this point he keeps up well with friends who are a year or more older , and prefers their company to kids who are a few months younger . 	0
WD	10727	Socially , I do wonder if being older would be helpful for him , especially since in adolescence it is socially advantageous for boys to hit puberty early ( it is risk factor for girls ) because that means physical strength . 	0
WD	10728	After his first day of preschool he was disappointed because â I didn â t learn anything . â 	0
WD	10729	I think he is a kid who is in danger of getting bored in a less stimulating / demanding environment . 	0

WD	10740	Only a fortnight ago a report was published by Robin Alexander and his team at Cambridge University which found that the primary school curriculum is too narrow and involves too much testing . 	0
WD	10741	Rather than taking on the challenge of addressing existing problems in a failing system run by overworked and pressured staff , Ed Balls is making a scapegoat of those who have chosen to work outside of that system , and blame them for noticing the government ' s educational failings . 	0
WD	10742	The reason for this is that kids and teens are getting their â socialization education â from other adults and their peers , without the guidance of their parents . 	0
WD	10743	Lastly , it is important to mention that these same negative values in public school are what is causing the increase in delinquent behavior , including drug abuse , sexual promiscuity , violence , emotional and psychological disorders , just to name a few . 	0

WD	10746	*** The real solution to improve the education system is , give every family with kids a voucher . 	0
WD	10747	The voucher can be surrendered at both private and public school . 	0
WD	10748	For that under privileged family it ' s a blessing , but for my family it was sad . 	0
WD	10749	The solution should have been fix the shxt school rather then wreck the good one . 	0
WD	10750	Some teachers get tenured and then stop trying to educate since they are now " retirement safe " this prevents a lot of the new graduates from obtaining a teaching carrier and replacing the dead wood . 	0
WD	10751	Each mother shared their respective observations of their kids , explaining how they came to their decision , when one mother interrupted , turned to me , pointed , and said , â I want to know what you would do . 	0

WD	10754	But Khyra was known to be at risk by the agencies whose job it was to protect her both before and after her withdrawal from school . 	0
WD	10755	The topic quickly changed to kindergarten entrance , which was charged with palatable anxiety over whether their child should start this coming year or wait a year . 	0
WD	10756	Prayer is something that needs to be and should be taught in the home , by parents . 	0
WD	10757	Two years ago I was at a cocktail party and making friendly conversation with a group of women . 	0
WD	10758	This is one hot topic . 	0
WD	10759	Thankfully our child had to contend only with changing neighborhoods and not schools too . 	0
WD	10760	Since we were homeschooling our only child , we were able to give greater support to him during this time of upheaval and change . â 	0

WD	10767	Parents put their kids on a Public School Bus , or drop them off at a Public School . 	0
WD	10768	When they do , they never know if they will ever see their child alive again , or have their child ' s innocence stolen from them , or have their child ' s future altered and scared forever . 	0
WD	10769	Most Parents want to send their kids to private schools . 	0
WD	10770	We exchanged basic information about each other , you know , where we live , how many kids we have , what we do for a living . 	0
WD	10771	Academics ? 	0
WD	10772	The school systems cannot afford to suspend or expel children . 	0
WD	10773	Emotional Security Bullying , peer pressure , teasing , competitive feelings are real issues that can mar the experience of a regular school for a child . 	0
WD	10774	Particularly for parents of only children , these issues often take nightmarish proportions ( and probably rightly so ) considering the deep care and protectiveness they offer their child . 	0
WD	10775	The principle seems straightforward â through registration , all home-educated children would become visible to the authorities , who could then protect them â and ensure that the education being received is adequate . 	0
WD	10776	If you want children to pray at school , there are plenty of Catholic and other private schools available . 	0
WD	10777	This is because they want the children to know , there is a price for acting up . 	0
WD	10778	I have seen in the public system , where a principal would give candy to the children that act up , to not do it again . 	0
WD	10779	It ' s ironic to me that the folks most likely to kvetch about all those worthless teachers and teachers unions are the ones who will then turn around and demand those teachers should be able to lead their students in prayer . 	0
WD	10780	Let me say , as a parent and as a Christian , I don ' t want my daughter ' s teacher or her principal or her classmates leading her in prayer in school â including what someone else might consider " good Christian prayer " or else some watered-down pablum generic invocation . 	1

WD	10789	In a matter of moments , five students were gunned down . 	0
WD	10790	As someone who went to a same sex school for 8 years , I found it lacked the diversity you get in a co-ed environment . 	0
WD	10791	Parent-Teacher conferences were set for Thursday . 	0
WD	10792	It was just a normal day in Chardon , Ohio . 	0

WD	10798	Gunfire . 	0
WD	10799	There is a time and a place for everything , including religion . 	0
WD	10800	I am not sure if this is already the case , but I believe that it would serve the State well to treat homeschooling as a type of private school and require that they meet the same standards as those registered facilities . 	0
WD	10801	I am involved as a parent , why is it that we have religion in Jails but not in the public school system . 	0
WD	10802	There ' s no doubt boys behave a little different when girls are watching , and i also found boys were quite good at limiting the bitchyness girls are renowned for . 	0
WD	10803	Some parents may see this as an invasion of their privacy and an intrusion , but the State has a responsibility to ensure that all children living in this country are properly educated . 	0
WD	10804	So both kept one another in line , and made for a more positive and dynamic environment . 	0
WD	10805	I also think there ' s a few extra life lessons and skills children can learn at co ed schools . 	0
WD	10806	Public schools have kicked prayer and Christ out and now their working on the pledge of allegiance . 	0
WD	10807	Really I ' m bad because I want my daughter to know Christ . 	0
WD	10808	Dating , relationships , interacting with the opposite sex , i think children at co ed schools tend to have a far better grasp of these skills then students who ' ve only attended same sex schools . 	0
WD	10809	So what makes your average mom or dad think they can do my job with no degree and no experience ? 	0
WD	10810	The unpleasant fact is that parents who want to abuse children have ample opportunity wherever their children ' s education is taking place . 	0
WD	10811	Public School is not the place for religion , unless we are doing a Comparative Religions course , in which all views are examined . 	1
WD	10812	Parents today can shell out some cash and skip the " Reform Period " by going private . 	0
WD	10813	I was a product of the public school system , and yes , they are very necessary . 	0
WD	10814	Secondly , banning school prayer can in no way be seen as somehow rejecting or abandoning the alleged divine protection that schools would otherwise enjoy , as such theological criticisms always seem to intend to imply . 	0
WD	10815	That in itself clearly does not transform schools into â God-free zones â ; banning schools from leading prayers , like banning schools from teaching religious doctrines such as creationism or posting religious rules such as the Ten Commandments , merely ensures that public schools remain religiously neutral environments , for students of every religion or no religion . 	0
WD	10816	For proof of this , all one need do is to recall the 2006 shooting spree which occurred in an Amish school in Pennsylvania . 	0
WD	10817	Officially implementing mandatory school prayers in no way offers a divine guarantee against school shootings from occurring . 	0
WD	10818	And this tragedy occurred despite the fact that community-based Amish schools ( which are not public schools ) conduct morning Bible readings and daily prayers . 	0
WD	10819	Or you could stop being so selfish to the child and send it out into the world so it can learn the importance of society and how to ineract with it . . . an education is often only useful if you know how to work with people using it . 	0
WD	10820	I ' m sure you are , but there are plenty that aren ' t . 	0
WD	10821	what like making sure you are fit to teach a child responsibly . . 	0
WD	10822	The girls in my year just had entirely different interests . 	0
WD	10823	In terms of results ; I really think it ' s mostly up to the individual and how driven they are , coupled together with a good teacher , as to whether or not they do well . 	0
WD	10824	Most of the people I have spoken to who have attended an all-girls school would have chosen to go co-ed had they been given another chance . 	0
WD	10825	I myself went to a co-ed , and am so glad I was able to â I only had a few close female friends , because I was way more comfortable hanging out with the boys â I just preferred playing sport during breaks than gossiping about what happened over the weekend . 	0
WD	10826	But there is also a case to be made for parents who wish to home-school their children . 	1
WD	10827	We in Barbados think of homeschooling as an activity that occurs only in North American countries or perhaps further afield , and cannot imagine why in a country that offers free education to all school aged children , a parent would want to take on the responsibility of teaching their child . 	0
WD	10828	The curriculum is much more hands on and students learn more . 	0
WD	10829	I am all for the public school system . 	1
WD	10830	It is a question I used to ask myself some years ago , until I recognised that the school environment of today is much more explosive than it was just a few decades ago . 	0
WD	10831	I would respectfully recommend you actually take the time to learn about home-schooling before posting such ignorant and hateful words but alas , the products of a liberal and intolerant educational system cannot possibly fathom such a possibility . 	0
WD	10832	Ah yes , the shining examples of the ignorance of home-schooling is well displayed in the majority of these posts . 	0
WD	10833	A second reason I deplore single sex schools is that girls and women are shortchanged as far as math and science are concerned . 	0
WD	10834	This is a skill that is not learned in a single sex environment . 	0
WD	10835	In order to get along in adult society most occupations require that their practitioners get along with both men and women . 	0
WD	10836	They learn to regard members of the opposite sex as people . 	0
WD	10837	In a coed school children deal with each other as individuals . 	0
WD	10838	It will no doubt require that officials of the Ministry of Education create measures to guide parents opting to go this route , and by extension require them to visit these homes to observe what is being done . 	0
WD	10839	One thing that I hope all people learn in school is to get along with other people . 	0
WD	10840	I regard single sex education as bad . 	1
WD	10841	â It â s the isolation that allows it to exist . " 	0
WD	10842	One friend of mine , a product of a girl ' s high school , had to take remedial courses so that she could satisfactorily take college level science course . 	0
WD	10843	My observations of women who were products of girls schools is that they do not have the same preparation that women who are products of coed schools do . 	0
WD	10844	So if we add Friday to the weekend , then Muslims can go to the mosque on Friday , and not have to choose between going to school , or going to worship . 	0
WD	10845	It â s simple ! 	0
WD	10846	Now , there are pros and cons for each . 	0
WD	10847	But I feel that the co-ed school is more " natural " and its pros outweigh its cons more than the all-girls school . 	0
WD	10848	Otherwise , any discussion of religion should be strictly technical . 	0
WD	10849	I switched to an all-girls school in the 10th grade and stayed until I finished high school . 	0
WD	10850	First of all , those of us who send our children to private schools are also paying for the public schools at the same time through our property taxes . 	0
WD	10851	I can not tell you how many times I have come across teachers with over inflated egos . 	0
WD	10852	Schools are not always bad because of funding etc . Sometimes they are un areas that are mismanaged or just have bad teachers . 	0
WD	10853	Good schools draw good students regardless of a private or public classification . 	0
WD	10854	They think they are a parent and saving the world of their students , when really they are incapable of passing on any amount of knowledge . 	0
WD	10855	But there ' s always going to be a difference of maturity between different individuals , whether male or female . 	0
WD	10856	My father continues to deny my condition to this day and like many disabled children in mainstream schools I was bullied . 	0
WD	10857	Girls are more mature than boys generally , yes . 	0
WD	10858	And personally , I was always more mature than most of the other girls , too . 	0
WD	10859	Since you can no longer pray at school or discuss God , I choose to raise my child with my beliefs and send her to a private school . 	1
WD	10860	Ask your daughters what they would prefer . . . Btw , I work at a co-ed school at the moment and the kids there get on just fine . 	0
WD	10861	Her year went really well too . 	0
WD	10862	And on and on . 	0
WD	10863	Girls do calming exercises ; boys run . 	0
WD	10864	It has a way of sharpening the mind . 	0
WD	10865	That â s likely to be good for all of us , regardless of gender . 	0
WD	10866	Hearing yourself say some of this gobbledygook aloud to your kids , though ? 	0
WD	10867	It is closer to the ' real world ' that way . 	0
WD	10868	I went to an all boys school â Can ' t say I particularly liked it , I would of much preferred gone to a co-ed . 	1
WD	10869	They will be more at ease around the opposite sex when they are older and it just makes sense . 	0
WD	10870	Kids should grow up in the company of both sexes . . . 	0
WD	10871	We were the worst in 12 years and were beaten by LOTS of co-ed and public schools . . . 	0
WD	10872	If it is purely education you are concerned about ( and not so much behaviour ) , our year ( at a private school ) went shockingly bad in OP scores . 	0
WD	10873	In saying that my sister really enjoyed going to an all girls school . 	0
WD	10874	So you can never tell . 	0
WD	10875	We are making this sacrifice for him because this is what is best for him . 	0
WD	10876	I would make the same sacrifice for my daughter but she is doing just fine where she is now . 	0
WD	10877	We are making it work and I can tell you , that I have seen a 100% difference in him . 	0
WD	10878	He is relaxed and eager to do well and so excited that his largest class has 14 kids . 	0
WD	10879	At the end of the day this is a very personal choice that each family has to make for their child individually . 	0
WD	10880	Some view much of what as taught as " secularism . " 	0
WD	10881	But none of this is praying to Darwin , or claiming him , or anything , a deity . 	0
WD	10882	This is a sticky subject . 	0
WD	10883	Some think of evolution as teaching atheism . 	0
WD	10884	If they wish to raise their children as atheists , that is their right no matter what anyone thinks . 	0
WD	10885	So therefore they must put up with the school forcing a faith , no matter how shallow , on them ? 	0
WD	10886	Please look forif you ' re interested . 	0
WD	10887	A good question here is how much does this cut into a parent ' s right to raise their children . 	0
WD	10888	Wow . 	0
WD	10889	This brings up a related topic about children ' s rights . 	0
WD	10890	There are serious problems in our public schools . 	0
WD	10891	Morals can only be built on the basis that a moral source-God-exists . 	0
WD	10892	Once acknowledgement of God ' s existence is removed , there is no absolute basis for morals , and a free society drifts toward anarchy . 	0
WD	10893	Young Mr . Powell is another tragic example of the fallacy of Home Schooling . 	0
WD	10894	Then its badness is just something you deplore in the abstract . 	0
WD	10895	Since prayer was removed from public school classrooms in 1962 , we have had a six-fold increase in violent crime , our divorce rate has tripled , births to single mothers have increased five-fold , the teenage suicide rate has tripled , and SAT scores ( standardized college entrance test ) have dropped 80 points ( approximately 10% ) . 	0
WD	10896	No matter how well intentioned , few parents have the education , time , and skills needed to teach . 	0
WD	10897	Parents have all the years before the kids start school in which to indoctrinate litt 	0
WD	10898	When your public school system ranks #50 in the nation you tell me , would you rather send your child to public school or honor them with attending a private school ? 	0
WD	10899	Those who find the schools beneath their ideal learning experience should join everyone in an effort to renew our schools , demanding better performance and . 	0
WD	10900	outcome and be willing to support the much needed funding . 	0
WD	10901	Independent schools have much greater freedom to follow other educational philosophies and practices - Montessori , Steiner , small alternative schools and Summerhill being particularly noteworthy . 	0
WD	10902	But the belief that the schools and teachers must meet their Christian education agenda ends any discussion . 	0
WD	10903	I feel my education was a perfect balance . 	0
WD	10904	The whole issue is just another example of a populace that has fallen into a big ditch , dug by those who despise authority ( Nobody tells me what to do ) , see plots and loss of freedom in every shadow , behind every bush , and in anything that will require them to think before they vote . 	0
WD	10905	Befuddled wishful thinking rules . 	0
WD	10906	Imo it ' s not healthy for anyone . 	0
WD	10907	Maybe that makes me awful but I cannot and will not be everything to them 24 / 7 . 	0
WD	10908	I simply don ' t have the desire or patience to be THAT present . 	0
WD	10909	I would shell out the money for private school before I homeschool . 	1
WD	10910	As Britain becomes more secular , it becomes increasingly ridiculous that outdated laws like that of collective worship stay on the books . 	0
WD	10911	They have lots of great adults in their lives . 	0
WD	10912	I am homeschooling and I am not under any illusion that I am " everything " for my kids 24 / 7 . 	0
WD	10913	It ' s important to remember too that private schools are neither required to hire certified teachers nor administer state tests . 	0
WD	10914	They also have wide latitude in deciding which students to admit and which to push out . 	0
WD	10915	The national average of public schools is pulled down by the number of such schools serving poor students . 	0
WD	10916	If these schools were eliminated , schools in the affluent suburbs would hold their own against the best private schools . 	0
WD	10917	But achievement is higher because students in private schools come from more affluent families than students in public schools , rather than because of better practices . 	0
WD	10918	This distinction is crucial . 	0
WD	10919	Using data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study , Sarah and Christopher Lubienski , professors at the University of Illinois , found that when controlling for demographic factors , public schools are doing a better job academically than private schools . 	0
WD	10920	The parents can talk to their kids about evolution and explain that they do not believe that evolution ever happened ; they can try to push the creation theory and see where they end up . 	0
WD	10921	At a time when public schools are the target of unrelenting criticism , the results of a new study come as welcome news ( " Are Private Schools Worth It ? " 	0
WD	10922	The Atlantic , Oct . 18 ) . 	0
WD	10923	But don ' t assume that one size fits everybody , because it doesn ' t . 	1
WD	10924	If you really enjoyed school , good for you . 	0
WD	10925	Each to his own , as I said . 	0
WD	10926	I learned nothing that I did not know before other than a handful of French verbs which have so far been of as much use as a chocolate fireguard . 	0
WD	10927	I feel strongly that I had a very good education , but my husband said his was lacking . 	0
WD	10928	Neither of us knows much about private education from personal experience , however both of us have met privately-schooled people at university and through work . 	0
WD	10929	These people have spoken about opportunities , like sport and music programs , that had not been available to us as public students , and the extra resources available at the private schools because there was more money available . 	0
WD	10930	The media is full of reports on the lack of funding for public education , and the number of teachers compared with students in the public system means classes are bigger than we â d like . 	0
WD	10931	But for a complete , general education do private schools offer the range of subjects , experiences and environment public schools do ? 	0
WD	10932	From my school experience , public schools offered more diversity socially , spiritually and ethnically , so I think it provided a more realistic view of the world I would face after school . 	0
WD	10933	If officials at your school have questions about the event , share our letter with them . 	0
WD	10934	To help these students , we have prepared a letter explaining students â well-established legal right to engage in prayer and worship at See You at the Pole and to promote the event at school . 	0
WD	10935	An impotent prayer is no threat to anyone . 	0
WD	10936	If you honestly think your kids will be permanently damaged by learning about evolution , get a grip . 	0
WD	10937	But an effective prayer to a God who hears â¦ well , I guess some might find that a little threatening . " 	0
WD	10938	I am not one who needs others to make the choices I made to feel better about myself . 	0
WD	10939	And it â s not even the superior academics . 	0
WD	10940	Full disclosure : my wife and I homeschooled our four children through eighth grade , and then used a mixture of private Christian high school and additional homeschooling throughout their high school years . 	0
WD	10941	But that â s not what drives this for me . 	0
WD	10942	And want one more fact that may surprise you ? 	0
WD	10943	Homeschooled children do not lag behind public school children overall in communication and socialization skills . 	0
WD	10944	Homeschooled children â s tests scores were not significantly affected by their parents â household incomes or whether their parents were certified teachers . 	0
WD	10945	Homeschooled children perform better overall in college â from their freshman years to their senior years . 	0
WD	10946	So why am I such an advocate ? 	0
WD	10947	Because homeschooling is what lets you guard and protect your child â s heart and optimally mold their character in a dark and fallen world . 	0
WD	10948	Trust me , I know . 	0
WD	10949	First hand . 	0
WD	10950	Learn what ? 	0
WD	10951	The BS they half-arsedly try to teach us ? 	0
WD	10952	Isherwood Yes , that ' s true , but the purpose is to give students time to collect thoughts , pray , do homework for the class at hand , etc . Sorry , I can ' t quote the source , but I read some statistics the other day that students who make time each day for some silence ( not necessarily religiously related silence and / or prayer , just silence ) do much better in school because people don ' t realize how much noise dominates our days and inhibits our thought . 	0
WD	10953	I don ' t think 2 minutes of silence could possibly hinder our absolutely terrible public education any further than it ' s current decrepit state . 	0
WD	10954	It ' s all good . 	0
WD	10955	Don ' t worry , I agree . 	0
WD	10956	They are still usually better than parents who have other things to do and who ignore the daily chore of teaching their kids schoolwork . 	0
WD	10957	I attended private school up until age 14 , and I have yet to learn anything from our public ed . system . 	0
WD	10958	True , but the scenario at the top was obviously over-the-top wrong . 	0
WD	10959	His father , Clarence Powell , defends the home-school education that Josh and his 11 siblings have received , and that he has a right to educate his children any way he sees fit without the government interfering . 	0
WD	10960	He eventually took remedial classes at a community college and has since transferred to Georgetown University , but he still has a long way to go in catching up on the years of missed education . 	0
WD	10961	When they declined , he petitioned the school system to let him in , but they declined too . 	0
WD	10962	Powell himself realized how far behind he was falling and had asked his parents to send him to school . 	0
WD	10963	One of his siblings , currently at middle school age , still hasn ' t learned to read . 	0
WD	10964	Powell tells of how his parents , who kept him and his 11 younger siblings out of public schools for religious reasons , failed to provide a basic education that left him far behind other children his age in areas like math , science , history , and English . 	0
WD	10965	The article profiles 21-year-old Josh Powell , the product of home schooling in rural Virginia , who paints an incredibly negative picture of the experience of getting your education at home . 	0
WD	10966	Why do some parents not think their kids can attain ? 	0
WD	10967	No student should be *ASSIGNED* to a single-sex school against his / her will , but I ' m all in favor of voluntary selection into one . 	0
WD	10968	I would much prefer my children attend single-sex high schools to cut down on the distraction factor . 	1
WD	10969	The Powells , of course , are just on case of a home-schooling family , but Josh thinks they are other kids like him . 	0
WD	10970	The example one of them gave was , " My neighbor held back her child , and now she ' s in first grade , and reading at a 4th grade level ! " 	0
WD	10971	Not only that , but far from the crisis in public education that many see , the Lubienskis make a strong case that public school are doing a fine job educating the youth of America . 	0
WD	10972	The results of the study don â t surprise me because I live in the real world , and in the real world the best get paid the most . 	0
WD	10973	According to Atlantic , the Lubienskis report that the Educational Testing Service , Stanford and Notre Dame all took a look at the same statistics â datasets they call it â and came to the same conclusions . 	0
WD	10974	The Lubienskis aren â t saying that public school students score higher , because test comparisons show that the average private school student scores higher . 	0
WD	10975	But the private school student is likely to be wealthier , come from a stable family , not have a disability and not have suffered early life trauma . 	0
WD	10976	Correct for these factors â in a sense only compare apples that fell from the private school tree with those that fell from the public school tree â and the public school wins hands down . 	0
WD	10977	It doesn â t surprise me that somebody figured out how to prove that public schools outperform private schools . 	1
WD	10978	And it doesn â t surprise me that this seminal study is being ignored by the mainstream news media . 	0
WD	10979	As of one day after Atlantic released its article reviewing The Public School Advantage : Why Public Schools Outperform Private Schools , a Google search yielded but one article covering the important findings of authors Sarah Theule Lubienski and Christopher A Lubienski . 	0
WD	10980	The Lubienskis took into the account the effects of affluence , disabilities and other background factors and found that then public schools outperformed private schools over the past twenty years . 	0
WD	10981	I don ' t think age really dictates how well you will do in school or in sports . 	0
WD	10982	The only reason most private schools show good numbers is because they can completely ignore all the problem students . 	0
WD	10983	Around here , there are plenty of choices , but the government only pays for public education of various types and those who can afford private schools pay for those above and beyond their property taxes that fund the public schools . 	0
WD	10984	I don ' t see the big deal . 	1
WD	10985	I do what is best for my children and assume other parents do what is best for their children . 	0
WD	10986	Interestingly , it wasn ' t the atheist Madalyn Murray O ' Hair who sued the school district to stop this , it was some Jewish parents , who thought that the prayers said in school would not be considered appropriate for Jewish students to pray . 	0
WD	10987	Let us hope they do not break the broad global consensus on education reform by pursuing ideological distractions that threaten to undermine the right to education . 	0
WD	10988	For many years the DFID has been a global leader in supporting sector-wide public education reform through the Global Partnership for Education . 	0
WD	10989	Lost revenues from tax exemptions given away unnecessarily by governments add up to $138 billion annually- which is more than enough to ensure we deliver on the full education and wider development agenda in every country . 	0
WD	10990	We need to support progressive macro-economic policies over austerity and we urgently need to expand the domestic tax base of low income countries , for example by ending the unnecessary and often corrupt tax holidays given to big multinational companies . 	0
WD	10991	We need to mobilise new resourcing for education , securing at least 6% of GDP and 20% of national budgets . 	0
WD	10992	We desperately need to improve the quality of public schools , and this issue needs concerted attention and support . 	0
WD	10993	Thankfully , most DFID funding for education is still spent on such efforts . 	0
WD	10994	Such investments yield systemic , nation-wide returns in improving quality â a much more strategic and effective use of public money . 	0
WD	10995	Ideological reasons for homeschooling are , in my opinion , completely legitimate . 	0
WD	10996	The public education system has not failed , it ' s got to deal with things that no private school does . 	0
WD	10997	Most private schools are nothing more than religious indoctrination , what difference does it make ? 	0
WD	10998	If you put the same restrictions on the private schools , they ' d be just as bad . 	0
WD	10999	America has experienced radical decline in each of the four areas which the children â s prayer touched upon : youth , family , education , national life . 	0
WD	11000	The New York school children which prompted the Engel vs . Vitale ruling had simply prayed : â Almighty God , we acknowledge our dependence on Thee and beg Thy blessing over us , our parents , our teachers and our nation . â 	0
WD	11001	The removal of prayer from our schools was a violation of the third commandment which commands us â not to take the name of the Lord in vain . â 	0
WD	11002	Minor recovery has occurred only since 1980 when the election of President Reagan brought forth a renewed emphasis on â traditional â values . 	0
WD	11003	Consider the following chart compiled from his study , America : To Pray or Not to Pray . 	0
WD	11004	A recent statistical analysis by David Barton graphically illustrates how America has plummeted from righteous living , prosperity and success in the last quarter century . 	0
WD	11005	On June 25 , l962 , 39 million students were forbidden to do what they and their predecessors had been doing since the founding of our nation â publicly calling upon the name of the Lord at the beginning of each school day . 	0
WD	11006	1 As you might have already noticed on Mr . Barton â s graph , America â s moral decline rapidly accelerated following one event â the U . S . Supreme Court â s removal of prayer from our nation â s schools . 	0
WD	11007	Worse than taking the Lord â s sacred name in vain is treating it with contempt , denying it rightful place and stripping it from public use and even from the lips of children . 	0
WD	11008	By the judicial act of forbidding invocation , the Court audaciously elevated a secularized system of education beyond the authority , reach and blessing of God Himself . 	0
WD	11009	Each school district is different . 	0
WD	11010	Each classroom environment is different . 	0
WD	11011	Each child is an individual . 	0
WD	11012	I continue to monetarily support a broken system that I can not even take advantage the so called benefits of because it does not give my child the adequate tools she will need to be successful in life . 	0
WD	11013	That February birthday excuses me from much of this anxiety . 	0
WD	11014	I think the social aspect of co-education outweighs the potential distractions ; at the end of 6 years , you come out with a study score , but once you have that , I think the memories and friendships you got out of those 6 years become much more important , and I can ' t imagine having as good an experience had I gone to an all-girls school . 	0
WD	11015	While a public school classroom is perfect for your 11-year old Johnnie , it might not be right for 9-year old Susie . 	0
WD	11016	While a particular school district worked well for your kids , perhaps moving to a new school district found them to not be so cooperative . 	0
WD	11017	Given the research on the topic , if you have concerns about your child â s behavior and that is why you are considering delaying them , this is important information that may signal your child would benefit from behavioral intervention , if not immediately than it is something to keep in mind as they progress through their early years of schooling . 	0
WD	11018	So what is the answer to the question originally asked of me at that cocktail party ? 	0
WD	11019	What will I do for Leo ? 	0
WD	11020	Well , he will be 5 1 / 2 at the time of kindergarten . 	0
WD	11021	Although I am a big fan of examining the data to inform parenting , the results often do not reveal a clear path , and although group level statistics are useful , they do not tell parents what their individual child â s trajectory will be . 	0
WD	11022	What is clear , however , is that given redshirting is much less common than originally thought , parents should worry less about how their child â s age will compare to peers ( there is no reason to hold them back just so they won â t be much younger than most of their peers ) and more about the signals their own children are giving them . 	0
WD	11023	The big areas to consider are : social skills ( ability to initiate and maintain play , sharing , understanding of own and others â emotions ) , academic skills ( knowledge of content areas such as letter / number recognition and phonics ) , ability to regulate impulses ( staying on task , following directions ) , and fine motor skills ( fine motor skills have been linked with academic success above and beyond content knowledge and attentional abilities ) . 	0
WD	11024	Interestingly , teachers rate enthusiasm to learn , ability to follow directions , and attention span as the most important factors for kindergarten success , less so than actual academic knowledge ( which parents tend to perceive as most important ) . 	0
WD	11025	Send your kids to school with their kids . 	0
WD	11026	Do something about it . 	0
WD	11027	Use your connections to power and money and innovation to make your local schoolâthe one you are now sending your child toâbetter . 	0
WD	11028	Use the energy you have otherwise directed at fighting to get your daughter a slot at the competitive private school to fight for more computers at the public school . 	0
WD	11029	Don â t just acknowledge your liberal guiltâlisten to it . 	0
WD	11030	Single sex education has been very good for girls , especially . 	1
WD	11031	Look at the women leaders in this country and you will find that they are products of single sex educational institutions . 	0
WD	11032	That would still be a step beyond even what those who complain about secularism are complaining to God . 	0
WD	11033	It is opposed because it represents the antithesis to the beliefs of those who set policy for much of our public school system . 	0
WD	11034	My kids won ' t go to public schools for a lot of reasons . 	0
WD	11035	I in good conscience could not ask anyone else to through good money after bad as you suggest that we all do . 	0
WD	11036	Values can be promoted , in accordance with the client population ' s choice . 	0
WD	11037	Private schools provide an option for respecting religion and expressing it publicly . 	0
WD	11038	Ms Wong is really the bad person here , because she wishes to impose a secularist establishment which cannot bring itself to keeping boys in the boys ' lavatories or allowing even elective religiously supported ethical education to be presented to students . 	0
WD	11039	We are so integrated in our neighborhoods and businesses that there is no chance that divisiveness might be exacerbated by private schools , especially in the contemporary religious environment . 	0
WD	11040	That secularism was the worst feature of Soviet Communism and we know what it led to . 	0
WD	11041	Prayer is an action which proclaims that life is more than saving the environment or accumulating wealth . 	0
WD	11042	If the textbooks contain any reference to God , there ' s trouble , and if the teachers happen to make any kind of a reference to God , or religion . . or the hereafter . . or what ever may have any religious connotation , the children tell their parents and the parents complain ! ! ! ! 	0
WD	11043	Time was , the school day started with a prayer , and yes , maybe religion classes , but not nowadays . . there would be full scale war . 	0
WD	11044	The movement to single-sex education in the US has been framed as a solution to both girls â absence from science , technology , engineering , and math disciplines and the perceived decline in boys â overall academic success . 	0
WD	11045	However , the data behind these assertions is shaky at best . 	0
WD	11046	Diane Halpern , Professor of Psychology at Claremont McKenna College and former President of the American Psychological Association , wrote a particularly biting review of the pro single-sex education literature . 	0
WD	11047	Perhaps as a result of the pro single-sex education framing , the US has seen an increased interest in single-sex schooling in the last few decades . 	0
WD	11048	More private single-sex schools have emerged and even many public school districts have begun to experiment with single-sex programs or classrooms . 	0
WD	11049	An important question that arises in consideration of public schooling , though , is if separate schooling is actually fair to all students . 	0
WD	11050	Where ever the Muslims go , they expect " special " treatment . 	0
WD	11051	Ohhhh , here we go again ! ! ! ! 	0
WD	11052	In order to keep everyone satisfied , there should be no religion in schools . 	1
WD	11053	No religion in schools . . . . this is what we ' ve come to . 	1
WD	11054	Too bad , if the Muslim children don ' t come back to classes after their prayers . 	0
WD	11055	If parents want their children to have religion , they are going to have to teach them at home or in their places of worship . 	0
WD	11056	For goodness sake , it ' s just awful . 	0
WD	11057	That ' s their problem , not the school ' s . 	0
WD	11058	To this day , I tend to feel uncomfortable around anyone who doesn ' t fit that criteria ( ironically enough , since I ' m a left-winged , pansexual atheist ) . 	0
WD	11059	No one is being forced to participate in the event , nor is it interfering with class time . 	0
WD	11060	Yes , they socialize with other people - but those people are other white , right-winged , heterosexual Christians . 	0
WD	11061	So what is the threat ? 	0
WD	11062	They just don ' t get it . 	0
WD	11063	They just don ' t understand the world . 	0
WD	11064	And , that starts with a high quality , fair education that focuses on techniques that work and teaches all students as individuals , not as stereotypes . 	0
WD	11065	There were not a lot of choices as far as curriculum and very few parents continued to homeschool through high school . 	0
WD	11066	I don ' t think that home schooling is good for children and I don ' t think that single sex schooling is good for children either . 	1
WD	11067	On September 25th , millions of students across the globe will participate in See You at the Pole by joining together before the beginning of the school day to pray for their friends , families , teachers , school , and nations . 	0
WD	11068	Whatever home schooling does for you intellectually , I can ' t think it can have that great an influence on their ability to fit in with other kids . 	0
WD	11069	Prepared to be proved wrong though . . . . 	0
WD	11070	Interesting . 	0
WD	11071	I commend your commitment and I wish you all the best for your sons . 	0
WD	11072	I suspect you will probably do a better job of educating them than most schools would . 	0
WD	11073	I can ' t help wondering , though , what the fallout is likely to be in terms of their ability to socialise with other kids . 	0
WD	11074	What bothers me here is that this appears to have been a group decision . 	0
WD	11075	None of us are perfect . 	0
WD	11076	That said , should the decision have been made by one person I would understand and cut that person some slack . 	0
WD	11077	There are many intricate details when making decisions in regards to drawing the line when separation is required . 	0
WD	11078	But such reasoning is deeply flawed and fallacious on multiple levels . 	0
WD	11079	Firstly , we have not â kicked God out of our schools . â 	0
WD	11080	Students can ( and do ) . 	0
WD	11081	In the wake of violent school-related tragedies , such as the recent massacre at a Newtown , Connecticut public elementary school , there is often a wave of heated rhetoric emanating from religious conservatives regarding how perhaps such school shootings might not have occurred if only we had not â kicked God out of our schools â by banning state-led school prayer . 	0
WD	11082	So , schools are by no means â prayer free zones â â the shrill objections of ultra-conservative Christians committed to the unconstitutional re-introduction of state-sanctioned , teacher-led daily school prayer notwithstanding . 	0
WD	11083	Just because school officials may not lead students in prayers does not mean that students are unable to freely pray on their own , throughout the day , at school . 	0
WD	11084	While acting in their capacity as employees of the state , public school teachers must comply by the constitutional rules that prevent the state from endorsing or promoting religion . 	0
WD	11085	( That also means that public school teachers may not post the Ten Commandments in their classrooms , or teach creationism in science classes , since doing so amounts to just as much of an unconstitutional state endorsement or promotion of religion as does leading students in classroom prayers . ) 	0
WD	11086	That was a hard call because he was pretty shy until high school . 	0
WD	11087	These techniques can vary from room temperature to instruction approaches . 	0
WD	11088	Some educators also suggest that single-sex education can broaden the educational prospects for both the sexes . 	0
WD	11089	When putting these theories into practice , however , experts have asserted that separating students has consequences that extend far beyond the act of learning . 	0
WD	11090	Social , political , and legal concerns come into play when dealing with instituting these policies in public schools . 	0
WD	11091	Proponents of same-sex education argue that a mixed-gender classroom can be distracting for many students , especially at certain ages . 	0
WD	11092	Leonard Sax , founder of the National Association for Single-Sex Public Education , argues that while merely placing boys in separate classrooms from girls accomplishes little , single-sex education enhances student success when teachers use techniques geared toward the gender of their students . 	0
WD	11093	Single-sex education ( teaching males and females in separate classrooms or schools ) is an old approach to instruction that has been gaining new momentum in the education reform era . 	0
WD	11094	Although the practice has long existed in many private schools , it ' s a relatively new option for traditional public schools and charter schools . 	0
WD	11095	Now that over 500 public schools offer some form of single-sex education , experts are renewing the debate over the value of separating boys and girls in the classroom . 	0
WD	11096	According to recent research on the differences between males and females , there are natural differences in how boys and girls approach learning . 	0
WD	11097	I can learn things for myself w / little effort . 	0
WD	11098	But I cannot teach someone else on an educational level , especially since the techniques have changed so much from the way I learned . 	0
WD	11099	My boys have needed help w / their homework at times , and I am honestly dumbfounded at the processes that are used today . 	0
WD	11100	Aside from the fact that I just could not ensure they would get the proper education they deserve for themselves , the only other con that I can see w / homeschooling though is the socialization skills . 	0
WD	11101	I have to say that I admire anyone who has the patience for homeschooling . 	0
WD	11102	I know that I could never do it and make sure that my boys got a good enough education . 	0
WD	11103	Because I ' m a much better " learner " than I am a " teacher " and admittingly I just don ' t have the patience that it requires . 	0
WD	11104	I can teach life skills w / no problem . 	0
WD	11105	I know there are other ways around it , but to me , the best way for kids to learn how to interact w / their own peers is by having the opportunity to learn in an environment that isn ' t necessarily always something interest-based like sports , clubs , playgrounds , etc . but that ' s just me . 	0
WD	11106	I know exactly what is spent per student , the check I just wrote . 	0
WD	11107	They removed me from school because school / teachers were teaching me nothing other than â you are thick so why bother teaching you â . 	0
WD	11108	My second son , whom graduated from MIT , received a â Mathematics and Verbal Talent Search Award from The John Hopkins University in 1995 ; when we attended the ceremony we observed that most of the recipients of the awards were home-schooling students and had foreign last names . 	0
WD	11109	No everybody can teach and learn at home , and some parents and students cheat at home as well as they do at public schools , and the big problem is that nobody could catch them because the most important thing for many parents in this country is that their children should have as many â As â as possible on their resu 	0
WD	11110	From the students I taught that were home-schooling , only one was exceptional brilliant , he got a very high score in the SAT , and he attended the University of Maryland , College Park to study engineering . 	0
WD	11111	Also , I know that I could have home-schooling my children , because I have a very high level of education , but I would not have the patient to do that , and I believe my sons were benefited with a very good education from a very good public high school with excellent teachers in Worcester County in Maryland ; my oldest son is a biologist ( Salisbury University ) with three masters , my second son is a mathematician ( MIT ) , and my third son is a mechanical engineer ( College Park ) . 	0
WD	11112	It isn â t the same the influence that a student mind has from several teachers and their way of thinking than from only one parent way of teaching . 	0
WD	11113	My three sons graduated from a very good high school in Worcester County in Maryland , and the three of them attended excellent universities . 	0
WD	11114	( And non of the home schooling families I know did / do that either , so what a silly thing to assume that ' s why families do it ) . 	0
WD	11115	It blows my mind to see a public school student with a cell phone , but the parents can ' t afford a box of Cheerios and a ham sandwich . 	0
WD	11116	My parents knew I was capable of more , that I was intelligent but somehow school weren â t willing to see it . 	0
WD	11117	I wasn â t me that â couldn â t be bothered to learn â it was the teachers who couldn â t be bothered to teach . 	0
WD	11118	Teachers in private school make a fraction of what teachers make in public schools . 	0
WD	11119	How is it that sending a child to a private school for religious reasons makes a parent , " bad people " ? 	0
WD	11120	Our liberal , anti-Christian government and the small minority of whining atheists have cleansed our public schools of any positive values and moral teaching . 	0
WD	11121	Revisionist historians have changed the textbooks to honor the immoral and eliminate reference to godly individuals and the good contributions that religion and churches have made to our society . 	0
WD	11122	They , instead , use our public schools to promote a liberal agenda and brainwash our children to follow those principles . 	0
WD	11123	And this author thinks we are " bad people " for shielding our children from this garbage and creating well-balanced , healthy minded adults who contribute greatly to help our communities ? 	0
WD	11124	The advantage of private school is simple , my money pays for my daughter to be surrounded by like-minded teachers and parents who all want the same thing for their children , a top notch education . 	0
WD	11125	The teachers and administrators are all held accountable and not beholden to a system that is more concerned with keeping people employed , per student spending and providing free breakfast and lunch . 	0
WD	11126	There are the rare exceptions where homeschooling is great - but for most it is child abuse . 	1
WD	11127	Regular testing should be required and if they fail it ' s back to public school . 	0
WD	11128	I have been known to crunch some granola myself and do not view this as a bad thing . 	0
WD	11129	Actually , after reading the comments , that is about the same percentage as my readers who choose to homeschool . 	0
WD	11130	While homeschooling is becoming more secular , the No . 1 reason ( 36% ) parents give for homeschooling is for religious reasons . 	0
WD	11131	However , one is in college and the other is going to be a junior in high school this fall , so that ship has sailed . 	0
WD	11132	Many parents commented that they can get through their lesson plans in just a few hours as opposed to the six hours of instruction it takes in school . 	0
WD	11133	Actually , I don â t remember any teacher I worked with ever saying a negative word about homeschooling . 	0
WD	11134	If you show respect to the teachers , they just might return the favor . 	0
WD	11135	I was rather offended at the teacher bashing . 	0
WD	11136	In a class of 25 this takes some time , but I believe it is a good thing for students to hear the various perspectives and express their views among their peers . 	0
WD	11137	This is because there is no classroom management to deal with , and there are often questions and discussion during lessons . 	0
WD	11138	I don ' t think that the big school model is very effective . 	0
WD	11139	Private through 8th grade then public HS . 	0
WD	11140	This idea looks logical on a Macro level sure . . . but it would take at least a couple generations before it paid off . 	0
WD	11141	Temperaments considered . 	0
WD	11142	Pros and cons must be weighed . 	0
WD	11143	For many parents , the Big Kindergarten Question causes much angst . 	0
WD	11144	With my daughter , I would have preferred a redshirt option but I had no choice because she has a December birthday . 	0
WD	11145	A lot of my friends feel the stress : Kindergarten or preschool ? 	0
WD	11146	At least that â s how it seems . 	0
WD	11147	Your child â s future success starts RIGHT NOW ! 	0
WD	11148	As do long-term educational goals : Will my kid still get into Harvard if he starts kindergarten without knowing how to write his name ? 	0
WD	11149	Private schools = better education ? 	0
WD	11150	I believe he â s ready because : * He knows his ABCs , writes his name , recognizes a few sites words and grasps basic math concepts . 	0
WD	11151	For me , the decision was made long ago : Kindergarten get ready for Ryan . 	0
WD	11152	Where will the child find the best role models , social circles , and friends ? 	0
WD	11153	Not necessarily but it typically has a stronger sense of community and common morals among families . 	0
WD	11154	Most wasteful in history ! 	0
WD	11155	Throwing good money after bad never works . 	0
WD	11156	Just look at how our government is run now . 	0
WD	11157	Ten girls were shot ; five of them died . 	0
WD	11158	If you don ' t want the liberals corrupting your child with issues such as mandatory acceptance of homosexuality , private schools are the only way to go . 	1
WD	11159	There is no education in public schools any more ! 	0
WD	11160	And shaming parents over it is only going to further the divide when it comes to schooling . 	0
WD	11161	It ' s not that I was taught that it was wrong , it was never a topic that was brought up . 	0
WD	11162	Lately I ' ve been thinking more seriously about my single-sex education after devouring Sheryl Sandberg ' s now infamous Lean In . 	0
WD	11163	One of Sandberg ' s bigger points is that a lot of work needs to be done long before women are in careers , graduate school , or even college , in order to teach them how to lean in . 	0
WD	11164	When people find out I ' m the product of eight years of all-girls ' schooling they often ask what the best part of the experience was . 	0
WD	11165	I usually answer , only half-joking , " I rarely had to shave my legs . " 	0
WD	11166	In Lean In Sandberg explains that as a child she used to organize all the neighborhood children and tell them what to do . 	0
WD	11167	But to this day she cringes when her siblings tell this story because : " When a girl tries to lead , she is often labeled bossy . 	0
WD	11168	Given this focus on childhood and adolescence I ' m surprised that all-girls ' schools haven ' t been discussed in the same breath as Sandberg ' s long-term project . 	0
WD	11169	Boys are seldom called bossy because a boy taking the role of a boss does not surprise or offend . " 	0
WD	11170	My professional , adult self certainly understands this sentiment , but my 13-year-old self would have been confused . 	0
WD	11171	But it turns out , she â s not the only one with this problem , and , in fact , given the rapid increase in single-sex programs in public schools , it looks like the trouble may only be spreading . 	0
WD	11172	Take a look at the recently-released November 2010 Arkansas Department of Education â s Application for School Improvement Grants . 	0

WD	11175	As a visiting student at Barnard College years ago , I attended the transfer students â orientation where each student was asked to explain why she had chosen Barnard . 	0
WD	11176	I â ll never forget one woman â s response : Well , I went to an all-girls elementary school and an all-girls middle school and an all-girls high school , and when I got to my co-ed college , I didn â t know how to function around the boys , so I decided to transfer to Barnard . 	0
WD	11177	Well , that â s one solution . 	0
WD	11178	I think I laughed at the time . 	0
WD	11179	Instead of using the program to meet its designated goals , JHS leadership used â the Academy as a dual gender reassimilation because the students were coming from gender-based feeder schools . 	0

WD	11191	@oommph - here you get to a sensitive subject - modern science contains hardly any proper science , just compare the exam papers from the past decade with those from the 70s and 80s . 	0
WD	11192	You ' re also making the mistake of directly comparing discrete subjects from school with a more broad-based approach used by home educators . 	0
WD	11193	We ' ve even done addition and subtraction exercises on a flight home from a holiday before now , and in a Parliamentary committee room one evening , so you can see we ' re all quite flexible about learning . 	0

WD	11195	He ' s interested now , so we cover the subject now and he ' ll learn it much quicker because of that interest . 	0
WD	11196	Also consider that school is about 25% efficient , so of the five hours a day of nominal lesson time , you lose a fair bit in disruptions , admin , not understanding ( or not listening to ) the topic and having it explained again , finishing the exercise and waiting while it ' s explained again to someone else , etc . Home education doesn ' t take long holidays like school does , so if you work it out , the 250 useful hours of learning at school during a year is easily matched and exceeded by home educators who are doing low-key , low-pressure teaching all the time . 	0

WD	11218	Many sociologists agree that females are , " unable to perform if they are not at least 50% of a class , they feel pressured by stereotype threat and the potential for gender bias , and so a 100% same-sex class would seem to unlock the potential for all females " ( Campbell 7 ) . 	0
WD	11219	And so , one can argue that a single-sex education can more accurately focus the learning needs of the targeted sex ; but does that secluded sex suffer from the lack of the opposite ? 	0
WD	11220	We must first come to realize that while males and females are not two different species , that are very different when it comes to learning , expression , and overall being . 	0
WD	11221	So , will a single-sex education make you smarter ? 	0
WD	11222	Nonetheless , it has been an on-going , contentious issue for society as to whether a single-sex or co-ed environment provides a superior education . 	0
WD	11223	Contrary to popular belief , the 500 girls that went to my school were not closeted-bible-loving-anti-social-feminists and we did , in fact , socialize with members of the opposite sex . 	0
WD	11224	I spent the last four years of my life in a private , catholic , all girls college preparatory high school and while one may say that I missed out on the standard , social facets of a typical high school experience ; I would argue till death that my all girls high school experience was something I wouldn ' t trade for the world . 	1
WD	11225	I , myself , felt more open and confident to participate in an all girls setting . 	0
WD	11226	I had classmates in high school that flourished in an all-girls setting , by allowing themselves to say and do things they wouldn ' t have done in the company of boys . 	0
WD	11227	Seems a tad delusional to me . 	0
WD	11228	For us , we are having the opposite issue -- we are sending our 4 YO twins to kindergarten early because they are academically , socially and physically ready . 	0
WD	11229	They miss the cut off by three months here , so it ' s been an issue finding a placement for them . 	0
WD	11230	So all this redshirting means that they are likely to have kids who are 2 years older then them in the same class as them by first grade . 	0

WD	11237	The latter point is crucial , as parents who opt to pay have prioritised education in their households and will provide a more supportive home environment â which is a key determinant of educational success . 	0
WD	11238	Even if there was some marginal evidence of an increase in gain of quality , it is questionable as to whether or not this could be retained on a larger scale . 	0
WD	11239	Furthermore , and there is no evidence to suggest that the â competition effect â of low-cost private schools helps to aid in the process of put increasing pressure for improvements in the quality of public schools ( in fact , private schools do the opposite , draining and pauperising the public sector ) . 	0
WD	11240	The narrative surrounding the causality of any ( flawed ) claims of difference in learning outcomes tends to relate to teacher attendance and school accountability . 	0
WD	11241	Even private schools that charge the lowest fees will not help extend access to the 57 million children not in school today . 	0
WD	11242	Proponents of low-cost , private schools argue that privatised schools offer a model of higher educational quality ; but it is here that the evidence is highly contested and inconclusive . 	0
WD	11243	Proponents tend to be highly selective in quoting what is often flawed , and superficial research about improved learning outcomes . 	0
WD	11244	The biggest flaw is that most comparative studies fail to control for the socio-economic status of children as well as the self-evident motivation of parents . 	0
WD	11245	I believe in discipline , accountability , and excellence . 	0
WD	11246	After all , I have a Master of Arts in Teaching , I did my time doing internships and student teaching , and I am experienced at teaching in the classroom . 	0
WD	11247	The proponents of privatised education argue that private schools make a difference by ensuring that teachers are in the classroom and that schools are accountable to parents . 	0
WD	11248	If so , the coherent response should be to invest in teachers within the public system : expanding and improving training and support , making school inspectorates work effectively and strengthening school management committees . 	0
WD	11249	These things are not attainable in public schools because the poor teachers and administrators are worried about getting sued by the parents for everything . 	0
WD	11250	It would only be fair , that if we were to bring Christian Protestant prayer back into the schools that we also allow for Catholic prayer , Muslim prayer and yes , even Satanic prayer to have their place within the school system . 	0
WD	11251	At best , it will create a lot of grumpy students who are forced to say something that they don â t believe teaching them hypocrisy and that religion is just something you say . 	0
WD	11252	Why would a public school , a school that isn â t designated as a specific Christian school , bring back Christian prayer into the schools ? 	0
WD	11253	It made me cringe to know that us Christians were depending on government , school boards and people who don â t subscribe to their faith to bring back prayer into the schools . 	0
WD	11254	While I am a Christian , and I follow Jesus , I don â t believe that bringing â prayer back into the schools â will do anything of value to our school system , our students or our city . 	1

WD	11400	I have a daughter now , and after an awful lot of thinking and discussing , I feel she , like my sister , is well equipped for school ( emotionally , mentally and academically ) , I feel when she starts in September she will thrive . 	0
WD	11401	I would have failed without a doubt ! 	0
WD	11402	I â m dyslexic , at school I could barely read , but after being home schooled my GCSE â s were mainly A â s and B â s and I now have a degree , this would not have been possible at school . 	0
WD	11403	To believe â one size first all â is clearly coming from people who have never suffered from learning difficulties themselves , from bullying , from the physically â sick with dread â feeling one gets on the Sunday knowing that tomorrow is a school day . 	0
WD	11404	I am one of 4 children , my sister thrived in mainstream school , so my parents let her stay there , my two brothers went to a different school altogether , school for boys with learning difficulties and they thrived in their school . 	0
WD	11405	Parents should have a right to raise their children any way they wish , but when they are failing to provide even the most basic elementary skills and knowledge they are depriving their kids of a chance to succeed in life . 	0
WD	11406	I â m sick to death of it ! 	0
WD	11407	Since the age of 10 I â ve had to put up with people judging something they don â t understand , telling my parents that they â re wrong for home schooling me ( even though I could not have been happier ) , they never asked me ( the one being home schooled ) how I felt about it , if they did they still wouldn ' t have listened , they ' ve made their mind up and they are sticking with their inexperienced views . 	0

WD	11411	As Clarence Powell himself says in the Post article : â A good education is not an option . 	0
WD	11412	It â breeds divisiveness and bullying , â and can even â build walls between public school students who would otherwise get along . â 	0

WD	11414	All our children are different so why should we teach them all in the same way / style , surly that â s just common sense ? 	0

WD	11428	I am delighted with the education my kids are getting at a private Catholic school , for the fact that trouble makers are dealt with , resources are good , and it is hard to put into words , but someone is keeping an eye on them all the time . 	0
WD	11429	I am democrat and I vote just like everybody else , but I can see the public school system just isn ' t what it used to be and that ' s why I want to send her to private school . 	0
WD	11430	If we could afford it , I would home school and be done with the system all together . 	0
WD	11431	would this happen in a state school ? 	0
WD	11432	I doubt it , as there are not the funds for a full time academic advisor . 	0
WD	11433	He also couldn ' t seem to learn to read . 	0
WD	11434	In the public school , our son was more well-adjusted with better manners and generally happier , but didn ' t receive appropriate levels of OT and ST . 	0
WD	11435	Our contention all along , no matter where he goes to school , is that everyone consider the whole child - not just the academic gains or his emotional well-being but the totality of our son as a person . 	0
WD	11436	Instead , he was given private placement in a non-public school . 	0
WD	11437	At his year end IEP , we pressed for appropriate services in the public school . 	0
WD	11438	Despite all this , he seemed happy enough with his peers in the special education classroom ; he was a bubbly , outgoing , talkative boy . 	0

WD	11449	It by definition must be NUMERO UNO in all areas of life . 	0
WD	11450	Well , duh , it is this simple : Religion is a structure of beliefs that influence everything you do , think , and say . 	0
WD	11451	Why ? 	0
WD	11452	All or Nothing people , there cannot be middle ground . 	0
WD	11453	In India , for example , low-cost , private schools often pay less than one fifth of a teacher ' s salary . 	0
WD	11454	These low-cost private schools share a common thread in that they extract a profit from the fees received , by either employing teachers who lack training and / or qualifications , or by paying teachers much lower salaries than those earned by teachers in government schools . 	0
WD	11455	UK aid is supposed to be focused on ending extreme poverty and support for low-cost private schools inherently contradicts this ; instead , such schools actually exacerbate inequality . 	0
WD	11456	Typically teachers are given short-term contracts ; they can be hired and fired at the whim of the private provider : this has dangerous systemic effects on the status of teachers and the credibility of the teaching profession . 	0
WD	11457	For parents with four children , living on a dollar a day , paying $8 or more per child per month consumes more than their entire income . 	0
WD	11458	DFID concedes that in India , â no schools charging below $8 are able to perform well â . 	0
WD	11459	DFID has found that : â Evidence does suggest that there are serious equity and choice barriers associated with the growth of low cost private schools â , yet , it seems that these concerns are not enough to stop new and further DFID investments . 	0
WD	11460	In such contexts , parents may choose to send just one child to the low-cost school ; and usually boys are prioritised , thereby excluding girls and children with disabilities . 	0
WD	11461	Depriving your child of a basic education is a form of child abuse . 	0
WD	11462	It can ruin your child ' s whole life . 	0
WD	11463	Home schooling should be illegal unless the parent can demonstrate that they are providing the same level of education as a public school . 	1
WD	11464	There should be a core national curriculum and testing to ensure children are achieving at least a basic level of education . 	0
WD	11465	In an increasingly complex , global technological society , all people need to have a basic understanding of science , technology and local and global culture , just to be able to function and make informed decisions . 	0
WD	11466	I don ' t see any need for home schooling any child unless the child has special needs or learning difficulties . 	1
WD	11467	If public schools are under-performing , then the public education system needs to be improved . 	0
WD	11468	Public education in the US seems to be a self-perpetuating disaster , with ignorant , uneducated , unqualified people on school boards deciding what children should learn . 	0
WD	11469	No amount of teachers and staff can keep students from throwing up a prayer before class or a test or before they eat lunch . 	0
WD	11470	As a student , i think schools should definately support prayer in schools . 	1
WD	11471	Children who don ' t want to pray don ' t have to , and those who do can have their concentration to do so . 	0
WD	11472	As far as a moment of silence during homeroom , I say why not ? . 	0
WD	11473	I fully understand nonbelievers or nonreligious people who dont pray , but their moment of silence can be used for relaxation or even sleep if they want . 	0
WD	11474	A moment of silence doesnt require students or teachers to pray ; Prayer isnt even mentioned in the words , so why make a big deal of it ? . 	0
WD	11475	Unfortunately , we have millions of kids and not all families have the resources to homeschool . 	0
WD	11476	In many underresourced schools , it â s the aggressive PTAs that raise the money for enrichment programs and willful parents who get in the administration â s face when a teacher is falling down on the job . 	0
WD	11477	And parents have a lot of power . 	0
WD	11478	If I have kids , I will probably homeschool them , because I think that homeschooling fosters real interest and excitement in issues , compared to the stressful motivators of grades and standardized testing . 	1
WD	11479	I also went to public school in a wealthy area in San Diego . 	0
WD	11480	I went to private school in " the hood " in Los Angeles . 	0
WD	11481	Why ? 	0
WD	11482	Private school wins , no matter where you go . 	1
WD	11483	Granted , this should be taught at home . 	0
WD	11484	Children are taught , not only the mandatory curriculum , but also how to be considerate , disciplined and respectful . 	0
WD	11485	In the future , should I have children , they will without a doubt be enrolled in private schools , K-12 , just as I was . 	0
WD	11486	But if you know that what your child is being taught at school emphasizes what you ' re teaching them at home and they ' re being supervised at all times , and they ' re getting a good education , how does that not make sense ? 	0
WD	11487	No self control at all . 	0
WD	11488	There is widespread complaint among parents that children are tested too young and too often , teaching them only to pass tests so that civil servants can compile ultimately meaningless statistics . 	0
WD	11489	More and more parents are choosing to home educate because the school system fails their children . 	0
WD	11490	Under the new regulations though , they would have the legal right to enter my home and interview my child alone in a room to " check " for signs of abuse , not because of any good reason to suspect abuse is taking place , but simply because I have chosen to home educate . 	0
WD	11491	The education officers who liaise with home-educators are trained teachers , not social workers , and so are not trained in the highly specialised field of child abuse . 	0
WD	11492	He claims that home education is the perfect cover for child abuse , but provides no evidence to support this claim . 	0
WD	11493	My greatest concern about Badman , though , is his suggestion throughout the report that being at home rather than with " professionals " means that the child is at a " greater risk of harm " . 	0
WD	11494	As with so much legislation that the government has managed to get through parliament under the emotive banner of " child welfare " , this proposed legislation peddles the idea that children can only be dealt with by professionals . 	0
WD	11495	This report is a solution without a problem . 	0
WD	11496	No , because what the report implies is that if you send your child to a school , you are less likely to be a child abuser . 	0
WD	11497	Will education officers also be going into schools and taking each child into a room by themselves to " check for signs of abuse " ? 	0
WD	11498	This superintendent was trying every possible way to improve the children ' s education and the union shot it down . 	0

WD	11505	Most of the homeschoolers I knew growing up were the stereotypical Christian homeschoolers with strict parents who didn ' t do anything secular or know anything about the real world . 	0
WD	11506	In this documentary the superintendent of schools in Washington DC offered to double teachers salaries if they were willing to give up their tenure and get out of the teacher ' s union . 	0
WD	11507	( Teachers get tenure after only 2 years of teaching which makes it virtually impossible to fire them for any reason . ) 	0
WD	11508	They could choose to stay tenured and keep their salary or give it up and double their salary . 	0
WD	11509	The teacher ' s union refused to allow it to be voted on by the teachers . 	0
WD	11510	One solution to the problem of how to set standards for schools that has grown increasingly popular in the U . S . is the use of private schools . 	0

WD	11516	First , may I point out that I am a product of homeschool . 	0
WD	11517	You basically get one opportunity to do it . 	0
WD	11518	I accidentally unleashed a firestorm debate on Facebook by simply asking for homeschool information from my homeschooling friends . 	0
WD	11519	The debate between homeschool and public school has been taking place for longer than I even know . 	0
WD	11520	Instead of receiving said advice , I started a debate of homeschool versus public school and socialization versus the lack thereof . 	0
WD	11521	When I graduated , state law did not yet allow ( or perhaps had just allowed . 	0
WD	11522	I graduated from homeschool in November of 1994 , a semester early . 	0
WD	11523	Most Americans are in favor of prayer in public school because they realize that there is something to be gained from the open acknowledgement of God ' s existence . 	0
WD	11524	Homeschoolers , on the other hand , frequently extend their everyday classroom in real community settings and interactions . 	0
WD	11525	When my kids got old enough for school , I sent them to private school and they were ready for University work . 	0
WD	11526	Some consider public school to be an artificial setting with students being locked behind school gates characterized by forced silence , age-segregation and school bells . 	0
WD	11527	There is pressure for all our pupils today in school â in fact far too much and too early . 	0

WD	11532	We were never formally told , we just swept it under the carpet . . . i still feel gulity for never saying " so sad for you , how can I help you now that you mum has died . " 	0
WD	11533	At Private schools , a food roster is started , and kids are told to reach out . . 	0
WD	11534	I know it may see , irrelevant , but people care more . . . for me , this is the perceived advantage of private schooling . 	0
WD	11535	Boys and girls going through their teens together is a far more realistic and healthy arrangement than either single sex girls school or a school where girls join the boys in sixth form . 	0
WD	11536	The teenage years are perhaps the most turbulent we experience and during this period growing up side by side as the norm and mixing with the opposite sex is a powerful and important life skill . 	0
WD	11537	Just learning and knowing how to interact with each other , feeling comfortable , going to parties and just appreciating from a boy â s view that girls are not some â alien creature â not to be talked to are vital factors in helping children to adapt to society as a whole . 	0
WD	11538	Parents who send their children to private schools do support public schools . 	0
WD	11539	So , how would this work exactly ? 	0
WD	11540	I bet you are going to do everything within your power to make it better . 	0
WD	11541	Your local school stinks and you do send your child there ? 	0

WD	11577	But , hey , my first year as a full time student in college was at 13 , which I ' m not anyore , but i feel like im behind because all of the General facts about things you learn in regular school , I don ' t know . 	0
WD	11578	I think that the superiority over one type of schooling doesn ' t exist . 	0
WD	11579	It all depends on the person . 	0
WD	11580	I went to public school and was in every club , president of some , and also was in the Student Body Presidency . 	0
WD	11581	Public schooling creates lots of oppurtunities to meet large groups of people . 	0
WD	11582	This was good for me because my type of personality is to lead people , though usually through manipulation bargains and other types of persuasion , not because im a strong leader . 	0
WD	11583	At the same time I signed up for homechooling so that I could launch myself into college . 	0
WD	11584	I ' ve never done regular homeschooling though . 	0

WD	11586	Honestly , of all the groups of people to be put through " separate but equal , " gender should be the least likely . 	0
WD	11587	Bottom line : Yet again left wingers hate competition and choice and want to force EVERYONE into their failed system ( see also : Obamacare ) . 	0
WD	11588	I ' ve known people who were HS where their parents didn ' t really teach them all that much . 	0
WD	11589	Public schools are not going to change even if you and every other parent went up there and complained everyday because the unions won ' t allow it . 	0
WD	11590	There are still great teachers in the public schools - lets stand behind them . 	0
WD	11591	That finding will no doubt come as a surprise to those who believe private schools are intrinsically superior . 	0
WD	11592	The simple fact is that these students will do well in any education venue . 	0
WD	11593	Instead of keeping these bright and well-behaved students in the public schools as models to other students , private schools take only the best and claim that their system is better since their student body is so much more elite . 	0
WD	11594	Responsible homeschooling families attempt to have open and honest communication , preparing children to deal with situations as they arise . 	0
WD	11595	In fact , homeschooled children are often confident , adept at communicating their point of view and capable of making wise choices and responsible decisions . 	0
WD	11596	It â s innate , a brain thing . 	0
WD	11597	But I â m that way , as is his dad and his sister . 	0
WD	11598	Students with special needs might benefit too . 	0
WD	11599	However , the flexibility provided by the homeschool lifestyle may allow students to develop expertise in other areas such as nature , travel and culture , or budgeting and home management . 	0
WD	11600	Homeschoolers might not study the same topics as peers ' neighborhood schools . 	0
WD	11601	Limited Breadth of Curriculum Some proponents of formal education are concerned that homeschooled students will not receive the breadth of curriculum that children receive in school . 	0
WD	11602	This argument simply does not stand , as most homeschooling families do not live in isolation . 	0
WD	11603	Sheltering Children vs . Strengthening Families A final argument that often crops is that homeschooled children are not prepared to deal with real-world situations . 	0
WD	11604	Families are able to decide how broad or how channeled a child ' s curriculum should be . 	0
WD	11605	They may not receive services from school-based special education staff , but they can receive individualized education in the areas most relevant to their needs . 	0
WD	11606	With our eldest son turning four next year , my partner and I have started discussing when he will go to school - and where . 	0
WD	11607	The problem is the public schools are running the schools poorly . 	1
WD	11608	The private school parents pay for Public , schools , as well as childless parents pay . 	0
WD	11609	So I don ' t blame those that spend more to send their kids to private schools , 	0
WD	11610	The unions are their main priorty , not the child ' s education . 	0
WD	11611	Also , if I hear one more person talk about the lack of â socialization â as a reason not to homeschool , I â m going to erupt . 	0
WD	11612	So why would anyone want to take their children out of the dominant public education system of our country and attempt to homeschool them on their own ? 	0
WD	11613	That â s easy . 	0
WD	11614	Kids do better academically when homeschooled . 	0
WD	11615	I think everyone who is able should consider homeschooling their child . 	1
WD	11616	However , there are also a number of respected private , or independent , schools within easy driving distance , so this is something else for us to consider when planning for our sons â educational needs . 	0
WD	11617	Somebody needs to . 	0
WD	11618	I am sick and tired of reading diatribes against homeschooling from those who have never homeschooled , don â t have children , or simply have a bias against the Christian overtones related to homeschooling . 	0
WD	11619	It ' s time to disestablish the Church in this country , as well , and allow children to pick any religion ( or none ) in their own time , without the Government pushing them in any direction . 	1
WD	11620	My husband and I both attended public schools . 	0
WD	11621	We aren ' t interested in whether you like it or not . 	0
WD	11622	So we had to do what was best for our children by finding a school that fit the same values we were trying to instill in our children . 	0
WD	11623	Teachers voted against everything us as parents were trying to accomplish . 	0
WD	11624	Very little changed with all our efforts . 	0
WD	11625	Reality sunk in . 	0
WD	11626	We put all of our effort into making the system better , joined every group , volunteered at the school and all events . 	0
WD	11627	Our family switched back to the charter school after doing exactly what the writer suggested . 	0
WD	11628	I ' ve had my children in parochial school , switched to public and now a charter school . 	0
WD	11629	That says something about our morals or ethics if you will . 	0
WD	11630	Even with aides , a teacher often has to slow down and / or pause the lesson to address certain disruptive behaviors ( saw this in my dcs ' class last year , which had multiple inclusion students , some of whom were non-verbal & had daily tantrums & outbursts ) . 	0
WD	11631	At any rate I do have a point to make . 	0
WD	11632	The fact that it made the news that these two kids were honest is amazing . 	0
WD	11633	The store management even provided them with some sort of reward . 	0
WD	11634	All of this attention and a reward for doing the right thing . 	0
WD	11635	Obviously , I touched a nerve and found out first-hand the extent of the cohesiveness among homeschooling community . 	0
WD	11636	As the elder Powell says , the failure to do so can be incredibly difficult for a child to overcome . 	0
WD	11637	Having those distractions ( not to mention having additonal aides in the room ) can be counterproductive to other students . 	0
WD	11638	People were able to learn social skills long before there were schools . 	0
WD	11639	You don ' t need school for this , since this can be provided by a properly functioning community of friends and relations . 	0
WD	11640	It provides children with the chance to work and play with their peers and promotes the development of social skills and interacting with people outside of the family . " 	0
WD	11641	@ Danot " There ' s a lot more to be learned at school than the syllabus . 	0
WD	11642	Home schooling , on the other hand , promotes independence , especially independence from the state - which is the reason totalitarians hate home schooling so much , and ban it so happily . 	0
WD	11643	What schools actually promote , of course , is not " social skill " but social conformity , social obedience , and social subservience to an unelected " authority " external to the family . 	0
WD	11644	That is the kind of thing that parents are supposed to be teaching their kids not to do . 	0
WD	11645	I highly doubt most bad people as kids are thinking to themselves , â You know what , when I grow up I don â t want to be a fireman , I want to hurt people â . 	0
WD	11646	Maybe just a bad choice or two has led them down a path that they did not intend to be on . 	0
WD	11647	Hell not all bad people are BAD people . 	0
WD	11648	Not all prisoners are bad people . 	0
WD	11649	Not all religious folks are good people . 	0
WD	11650	Now I understand that there is GOOD and BAD in everything . 	0
WD	11651	You know about 60 % of religious people that I have personally met are hypocrites they preach about this and they preach about that and then once they are done putting on there Sunday best they go home drink a fifth and beat their kids . 	0
WD	11652	Last time I checked you were supposed to let God do that kind of work . 	0
WD	11653	Who do you think that you talking to a non-religious person is going to get them to change or believe what you believe . 	0
WD	11654	I ' m sending them there to learn . 	0
WD	11655	Plus , from my own sports experience , age has little to do with sports once you hit the high school level anyway -- I played Varsity Volleyball and Varsity Track as a freshman ( when I was 14 ) . 	0
WD	11656	She claims it makes a " huge " difference for sports . 	0
WD	11657	Personally , I ' m not sending my kids to school to play sports . 	0
WD	11658	I can certainly understand it if the parents feel the kid isn ' t ready , but what I ' m hearing a lot of in our area is parents ( particularly of boys ) doing it because they feel it will make their kid the " class leader " or the " best " in sports ( which is ridiculous IMHO ) . 	0
WD	11659	One of the girls I went to high school with went redshirted two of her three boys because of the sports issue alone ( apparently , she didn ' t know she had the option with the first one but would have redshirted his too if she had known ) . 	0
WD	11660	In Chicago , Illinois ( USA ) , the school district instituted a policy that required 6 YOs to be placed in 1st grade if their parents held them back from Kindergarten . 	0
WD	11661	Redshirting has become such an issue there that the school district felt they had no choice . 	0
WD	11662	Most of the team was made up of seniors and juniors ( who were 3 to 4 years older than me ) . 	0
WD	11663	And really , how can you as a parent feel proud of your child and feel that he is " better " at sports than his classmates when his classmates are 2 years younger than him . 	0
WD	11664	I ' m on the same page as FedUp . 	0
WD	11665	classroom teacher , who often is not special ed certified , has his / her resources & abilities stretched to try to accommodate the special needs in their class . 	0
WD	11666	It isn â t necessarily better to have kindergarten classes full of 6- and 7-year-olds . 	0
WD	11667	( A good example is Hope Academy in Concord , N . C . ) 	0
WD	11668	If you can â t do that , take advantage of the growing number of schools that offer a combination of homeschooling and formalized classroom experience . 	0
WD	11669	But because there are few voices out there promoting for it , let me make mine loud and clear . 	0
WD	11670	It â s a difficult thing to advocate for what you feel may be the best for a child without unduly demeaning the good being done in other settings . 	0
WD	11671	Not just for the academics , but for their protection . 	0
WD	11672	If you can homeschool your child through at least the middle school years , do . 	1
WD	11673	And that â s what your goal should be : parenting your child â s inner world . 	0
WD	11674	But even if there was a conflict ( there isn â t ) , sports don â t outweigh what â s best for your child â s heart . 	0
WD	11675	I know so many of you strive to bring Christ to bear on that setting . 	0
WD	11676	Please know how much I respect and value the hard work and clear calling present in the life of countless teachers and administrators in the public school system . 	0
WD	11677	Let us require the parents to insure those children learn the same subjects , as their age peers , in public or private schools . 	0
WD	11678	Let us required the children to take standardized tests . 	0
WD	11679	And if you experience any difficulty promoting or participating in the event , contact us . 	0
WD	11680	The bible says to pray in private . 	0
WD	11681	That , within itself , is a major problem : these children do not receive that personal contactt with other children of their own ages . 	0
WD	11682	The majority of home schooled children I have met , and had contact with , are smart and get along well with adults , but have an awful time relating to other children . 	0
WD	11683	Happily , some parents realize this , and have their children participate in other groups , such as church , Scouting , 4H , etc . to get that additional group support , and friendships amongst their peers . 	0
WD	11684	They simply do not learn to interact with their peers , and thus are constrained by that pressure , the rest of their lives . 	0
WD	11685	The parents , described in this article , are doing their children a disservice by refusisng to not only let them , but require them to have that knowledge , required in todays workplace . 	0
WD	11686	This is an important part of education , and goes along with the actual learning skills and knowledge required of todays citizen , in order to further their education , get a job and advance through life . 	0
WD	11687	This state needs to immediately back off on the present rules , and fix the problem . 	0
WD	11688	They have robbed them of the chance to advance in life , and that is child abuse . 	0
WD	11689	We do have a lot of private schools around us , we are starting to look into the cost , as ODD is now 3 we figured we should start looking into it . 	0
WD	11690	Early formal education , adult-led activities , single age classes , each child across the country pretty much studying the same thing , in the same way at the same time irrespective of ability , interest or other opportunities . 	0
WD	11691	Funny I really could care less if people are offended by these things , but I am quite concerned that God might be . 	0
WD	11692	Private schools do not receive money from the federal or state governments , so they have significantly more freedom in the types of courses to offer , the types of teachers they hire , and the requirements for graduation . 	0
WD	11693	If you can afford private school ( even if affording means scrimping and saving , or taking out loans ) , chances are that your spawn will be perfectly fine at a crappy public school . 	0
WD	11694	Inclusion can be successful & rewarding for all involved but it also has drawbacks . 	0
WD	11695	It ' s ironic that it is viewed as anti-christian to not want prayer at school and in public venues , to not want " In God We Trust " on our money , and to not want " One nation under God " in the pledge of allegiance because we really haven ' t earned that claim . 	0
WD	11696	Cut down on the ( misogynistic ) bigotry in the classroom and society and there won ' t be any perceived " need " for single-gender classrooms . 	1
WD	11697	Seriously , our society depends on us interacting with each , at the very least , since we each make up over half the damn species ! 	0
WD	11698	In light of that fact , there are only two reasons why students are enrolled in private schools : 1 ) It is a matter of prestige in order to instill an image of elitism , or 2 ) people have been intentionally misled into believing that private schools are " better " than their public counterparts . 	0
WD	11699	So , my high school diploma is a GED which I passed with flying colors and had my choice of colleges to attend . 	0
WD	11700	There is no partnership between the parents and the teachers and as a result , there is a tendancy for the parents to side ( usually unfairly ) with their kids . 	0
WD	11701	Unless you are actively involved with the ongoing education of your children , helping to shape their character and working with them to develop themselves into positive , constructive members of society , then you will wind up with what we are seeing . 	0
WD	11702	The main problem with public schools is parent participation . 	0
WD	11703	What you see is 10% of the parents being involved and the rest of them expect the school system to take care of their kids . 	0
WD	11704	People do not send their kids so they can associate with rich kids , they send them because they know the expectations are higher and that their kids will have a chance at a better education because of it . 	0
WD	11705	A school system that is struggling , against the odds to somehow , marginally educate our children . 	0
WD	11706	There ' s nothing wrong with private schools . 	1
WD	11707	I know several people who said that they wish their parents had waited a year to send them to kindergarten . 	0
WD	11708	DH was 4 when he started school and was only 17 when he graduated from HS . 	0
WD	11709	He hated that everyone was doing everything a year before he could do it . 	0
WD	11710	He was very good at sports though , even though he was a year younger than anyone else on his team . 	0
WD	11711	I honestly made my decision because I had a choice and I just did not feel right personally about sending my DS to Kindergarten at age 4 . 	0
WD	11712	Last year the cut off was October 9th I believe and this year it has been changed to July 1st . 	0
WD	11713	DS ' s birthday is August 30th . 	0
WD	11714	I did not wait to send DS because I wanted him to have an edge over anyone . 	0
WD	11715	Age has nothing to do with ability and if he were the type who would struggle , he would struggle regardless of when he started school . 	0
WD	11716	I do not compare my children with other people ' s children . 	0
WD	11717	What appears at first glimpse to be good progress might not be , according to psychotherapist Melinda Clayton , who practices in Florida and Colorado . 	0
WD	11718	A study released last August showed that the New York City Department of Education is making good progress toward reforms that will reverse a longstanding practice of segregating special education students in their own classrooms and schools , the New York Times reported . 	0
WD	11719	Ours will be that the State Education system is totally ruined , due to many years of being systematically abused by left-wingers . 	0
WD	11720	I wouldn ' t trust a state school to train a dog , much less raise a child . 	1
WD	11721	Should schools be forcing children to worship anyway ? 	0
WD	11722	I was merely soliciting information from them to add to our decision making process . 	0
WD	11723	For the majority of the children in the school , mainstream would not have been a suitable placement . 	1
WD	11724	Many didn ' t speak at all , had extremely challenging behavior and needed to access the curriculum in a very different way to how they would in a mainstream setting . 	0
WD	11725	As has been mentioned by others it really depends on the child and the resources available . 	0
WD	11726	I am a teacher ( currently SAHM ) and worked in a specialist school for children with severe learning difficulties and ASD . 	0
WD	11727	In some cases , inclusion can work fantastically well . 	1
WD	11728	My school had an inclusion class attached to a local mainstream school . 	0
WD	11729	Their needs can be far better met in a specialist school with specialist teachers and resources . 	0
WD	11730	No offended intended to teachers in mainstream settings-I just think it ' s a lot to ask when they may have a class of 30+ children with completely different needs to consider and limited training in SEN . 	0
WD	11731	The pupils would spend the majority of the time in the inclusion classroom , but spend a few lessons a week in a mainstream class ( with a known teaching assistant ) . 	0
WD	11732	They usually went in for sessions like Art , where the difference in ability is less obvious . 	0
WD	11733	Public school are just as good really , if you find the good ones out of the lot that is - In CT they are recognizable 	1
WD	11734	Every one does not have to pray if you choose not to then that is your choice . 	0
WD	11735	Me being a young teen in school , have witnessed first hand to this and i can truly say that prayer should be allowed in schools . 	1
WD	11736	Not only has it affected the schools it has also affected the homes and the homes and its inhabitants . 	0
WD	11737	I believe that prayer being banned from the public school systems was by far the most uneducated and most of all immoral thing that could have been done . 	1
WD	11738	The United States , a far more religious place than this nation of lost souls , has enshrined that idea in its constitution : the state must not support or endorse any religion , so that people can be free to choose their own without coercion . 	0
WD	11739	But more important than that , imposing a state-sponsored religion is wrong . 	1
WD	11740	Please don â t let the ignorance of 10 people ruin a nations well being ! ! ! 	0
WD	11741	Increasingly , girls have been besting boys â performance across the board : G . P . A . s , school leadership , graduation rates , college attendance . 	0
WD	11742	No organized prayers or services anywhere on public school board property - FOR ANYONE . 	1
WD	11743	In those cases , children can end up being home-schooled by people who may not have the attitude or aptitude for it . 	0
WD	11744	I went to co-ed schools from kindergarten until the end of 9th grade . 	0
WD	11745	I will have 10 special education students in one class period , and another math teacher with the same class in the same period will have none . 	0
WD	11746	I have ADHD and really struggled with the classroom setting- I had too much energy to stay in my seat , I was making too much noise , I was disturbing the other kids , etc- and because of that I spent virtually all of elementary school on behavior contracts that to this day still fill me with an acute sense of shame . 	0
WD	11747	In middle school , I was severely bullied and isolated . 	0
WD	11748	That led to the development of various mental illnesses in ninth grade , and between that and the ADHD , I couldn ' t handle public school anymore and switched out . 	0
WD	11749	I had some great teachers , I had good grades , and I had a small handful of friends , but ultimately public school did not work for me . 	0
WD	11750	The success of homeschooling depends so much on the student , the parent , and the environment they live in . 	0
WD	11751	I did ten and a half years of public school , and then switched out halfway through ninth grade to homeschool . 	0
WD	11752	I now do online school and I think it works fairly well for me . 	0
WD	11753	Yes , I succeeded in school and was generally an A student , but that was mostly because I ' m naturally intelligent and capable . 	0
WD	11754	Yes , I face social barriers now , but honestly I ' m just as awkward as I was in public school . 	0
WD	11755	I have trouble with self motivation sometimes , and take lots of breaks , but I always get all of my schoolwork done . 	0
WD	11756	And the same goes for any child in any school , as any teacher will tell you . 	0
WD	11757	Frankly , the difference is in the parenting and input , not in the method of education . 	0
WD	11758	Homeschooling is not something I have a problem with . 	1
WD	11759	Same with the daughter . 	0
WD	11760	If he likes it , he ' ll stay , if he doesn ' t like it , he ' ll stay and i ' ll work with the school to sort the problems , if he still doesn ' t get on , i ' ll homeschool . 	0
WD	11761	As a secondary teacher who is currently a SAHM with two kids under 4 , I ' ve applied for my sons ' primary place next year . 	0
WD	11762	60 % of them were homeschooled badly , were not up to speed , had evidently not done much mixing , and the kids themselves struggled to fit in at all for the first few years and did not do as well academically . 	0
WD	11763	They went on to do very well . 	0
WD	11764	40% of them were fantastic and had obviously had superb parenting and a grounded education with lots of input from a variety of educators and people . 	0
WD	11765	However , I have taughth some children who have been homeschooled up to Secondary level . 	0
WD	11766	St . Clair high school would once again have both good and bad consequences because boys would most likely do better because of the presence of girls , but girls would most likely do worse . 	0
WD	11767	If De La Salle had teachers capable of punishing students and keeping the boys on track while in school , then it would most likely be a benefit , if the staff lacks the ability to control the boys , it would be bad . 	0
WD	11768	It breaks my heart when I hear about other teachers ridiculing these students in class or dismissing their needs . 	0
WD	11769	I do know one family over-sheltered homeschoolers who fit the stereotypes ; and I know some AWESOME , WONDERFUL people who go to public school . 	0
WD	11770	Healthy , wonderful people can come out of any education ; same for unhealthy people . 	0
WD	11771	There are such things as homeschool groups , and we get together just for the purpose of socializing . 	0
WD	11772	I have so many AMAZING friends now from homeschool events . 	0
WD	11773	There are exceptions to this , but this is true for the MAJORITY of homeschoolers : you get healthier socialization ! 	0
WD	11774	5 . ) 	0
WD	11775	I could go on forever , but I won ' t . 	0
WD	11776	So those are my main points . 	0
WD	11777	I would think it weird to talk to someone in another grade back at school , but I have friends I can honestly call BFFs ranging from age 11-23 . 	0
WD	11778	Plus , you ' re exposed to a wider age range when you ' re homeschooled . 	0
WD	11779	I can also see how child abusers could use home-schooling as part of their evil plans . 	0
WD	11780	The debate around single sex versus co-educational ( co-ed ) will always be a controversial one . 	0
WD	11781	That ' s nice I suppose . 	0
WD	11782	Everyone interested in education will have their opinion and although data would indicate that single sex girls â schools might produce the best results , it would seem to be that there is more to this debate than just academic results . 	0
WD	11783	This is the reality of public education today . 	0
WD	11784	I have experience working in all boys â schools and co-eds and although I have not worked in a single sex girls â school , I strongly believe that the most important factor in all this is the school itself . 	0
WD	11785	I have a december baby and a may baby â my dec son went to kdg at almost 6 b / c of a sept cutoff and my may son went to kdg at slightly over 5 â¦ . 	0
WD	11786	I didn â t debate and didn â t lament â - I did what the cutoff suggested AND guess what ? 	0
WD	11787	Around third grade , everything evens out and I see it with all the kids â they are all doing what they are supposed to be doing when I look at both my sons and the rest of their classes . 	0
WD	11788	While history suggests boys are stronger at Maths and Science and girls are more linguistic , I believe this gender divide can be bridged by an educational framework which is inspiring and uses a range of teaching strategies . 	0
WD	11789	I totally agree that this segment was driven by helicopter parents . 	0
WD	11790	We must say that our kids are doing what they should be doing b / c they are who they are and not say things like performing at the top and exceeding this or that because IMO â we just propel the argument . 	0
WD	11791	I did like what they speculated in the segment about what will be with all these kids as adults â I am so curious ! 	0
WD	11792	RB 	0
WD	11793	I have seen this first hand as both a teacher and through lesson observations , as the Headteacher of North Bridge House School , it is the more social dynamic side to fully integrated co-eds that I believe to be so important . 	0
WD	11794	The issue of home schooling is one that always seems to spark a fierce debate , and a story published yesterday by the Washington Post is only likely to add fuel to the fire . 	0
WD	11795	Play , which is really a child â s â work , â contributes to cognitive , physical , social , and emotional growth . 	0
WD	11796	Christian , Jewish , Muslim , Hindu , Sikh , Buddhist , Jedi , Star Trek , etc . . . 	0
WD	11797	The father doesn ' t appear very well educated since he doesn ' t seem to have steady employment other than being a handyman of some sort . 	0
WD	11798	No religious activities in schools . 	1
WD	11799	If there ' s a demand for single-sex schools , those should be an option available to families . 	0
WD	11800	The best way to respect all religions is to show favoritism to none . 	0
WD	11801	â Standardized tests and other pressures have changed the trajectory of elementary education . 	0
WD	11802	It is a totally deteriorated system , it needs to be torn down and start over with the same kind of private education that made this country great in the first place . 	0
WD	11803	Too many liberals who have been indoctrinated by public universities that have no standards of right and wrong or decent and immoral . 	0
WD	11804	Tried hard to change the public system . 	0
WD	11805	That â s the practice of not starting a child in kindergarten until after his or her sixth birthday . 	0
WD	11806	A 60 Minutes segment this week focused on â redshirting . â 	0
WD	11807	The segment has generated a lot of conversation both online and in neighborhoods and preschools . 	0
WD	11808	It isn â t because of school-district rules , but is something that parents do to give their child an advantage from kindergarten and beyond . 	0
WD	11809	As the mom of a boy with an August birthday and a September 1 cutoff in our school system , I was torn about the potential advantages of an extra year of preschool . 	0
WD	11810	Including the one my kids attend . 	0
WD	11811	I had the opportunity to discuss this issue with Ann Densmore , EdD , an expert in language and social communication skills in children and co-author of Your Successful Preschooler . 	0
WD	11812	( My husband was not . ) 	0
WD	11813	And believe me it has been an adjustment . 	0
WD	11814	Not just the private to public adjustment but also day care . 	0
WD	11815	The only reason why we decided to take out daughter of private school this year is because of the price . 	0
WD	11816	Up until now we were able to afford it , but with my long commute everyday and gas prices and all other prices not coming down we had to make a very difficult decision . 	0
WD	11817	Not only is the learning environment better and more organized so are the teaching practices . 	0
WD	11818	In the private setting she is not being taught how to pass a test so that the school can remain accredited or whatever she is being taught how to think and organize her ideas , and she is actually graded , and not passed along if she can just get by . 	0
WD	11819	Wow ! ! ! 	0
WD	11820	If I have the choice and the opportunity to do so I will gladly put her back in private scholl without hesitation . 	1
WD	11821	He likes it and seems excited by the prospect of being a big kid in school . 	0
WD	11822	* He knows a lot of the kids who will start kindergarten with him ( thanks to preschool ) . 	0
WD	11823	I like the fact that she is being challenged by her school work and even being pushed to begin learning at least a grade level higher . 	0
WD	11824	* He is familiar with the elementary school , a benefit of having an older sibling . 	0
WD	11825	For example , Ryan recently tried to help a friend at school and the friend ( politely , kindly , rightfully ) declined Ryan â s help . 	0
WD	11826	Ryan â s feelings were hurt so he hit his friend . 	0
WD	11827	The question mark is his maturity . 	0
WD	11828	He can be impulsive . 	0
WD	11829	Girls like reading ; boys don â t . 	0
WD	11830	Not just lip-service investment , or property tax investment , but real flesh-and-blood-offspring investment . 	0
WD	11831	I think my view differs from my gal pals because I was able to leave and see the other side . 	0
WD	11832	She reiterated the fact that it all does depend on the person . 	0
WD	11833	And his wife appears to be so cowed she doesn ' t speak for herself . 	0
WD	11834	Often , those who do well academically / behaviorally are often left on their own unless a parent continually advocates for their dcs in order to ensure that things are done to help them reach their full potential . 	0
WD	11835	As wonderful as it is that students want to help take care of the inclusion students , calming down another student means that the child doing that is taking time away from his / her own learning , not the mention the initial distraction that the outburst created . 	0
WD	11836	The primary responsibility of the education of a child rests on the parents . 	0
WD	11837	This puts a tremendous amount of pressure on me , as I want to help all of my students , but can ' t provide the one-on-one time that my students need during class time . 	0
WD	11838	They went to school with them . 	0
WD	11839	They grew up with them . 	0
WD	11840	The point that I am trying to make here is that special education students already have a learning curve , so to speak , and we as teachers need to do everything we can to assist them . 	0
WD	11841	. 	0
WD	11842	My belief is preschool , kindergarten and even 1st grade should be exciting and fun so kids associate those qualities with learning . 	0
WD	11843	Another thing that I feel parents should be aware of : I personally found that girls who attend all-girls school will go out more to actually meet boys than girls in co-ed schools . 	0
WD	11844	What I mean by this is , girls in co-ed schools will hang out with boys from school ( inside and outside of school ) , yes , but the fact is : they know these boys . 	0
WD	11845	But that ' s just my opinion . 	0
WD	11846	Special education teachers see this and place more students in my classes than in other math teachers ' classes . 	0
WD	11847	I know that seems like such a minor gripe , but trust me , you don ' t want to be surrounded by the bullshit girls can concoct amongst each other when there are no boys to " restrict " certain behaviours . 	0
WD	11848	Whether they can write their names in kindergarten is not the point . 	0
WD	11849	Students can pray all they want together or by themselves , and very few people actually argue against this , at least I think . 	0
WD	11850	Prayer in schools should not be led by a school official ( who is a gov ' t official if we are talking about public schools ) . 	1
WD	11851	I see no reason why kids need to have a school-led prayer , or a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance , for that matter . 	0
WD	11852	If teachers aren ' t willing to step up to the challenge , they shouldn ' t enter the teaching profession in the first place . 	0
WD	11853	Seriously . 	0
WD	11854	But here are my reasons : 1 . ) 	0
WD	11855	As a parent , I support that concept as long as the inclusion doesn ' t come at the expense of the other students in class . 	0
WD	11856	Each of these examples are a bias when there is no balance or equal time given to educate other views in the public schools . 	0
WD	11857	I believe that everyone should be allowed to believe whatever they want to believe and pray to whomever they want to pray . 	0
WD	11858	But what does bug me and what I do feel is unacceptable is when people try to impose they â re religious beliefs FORCFULLY on someone else . 	0
WD	11859	Lastly , every person sending their children to private schools will pay for public schools as well through local taxing especially if real estate taxes fund that government system too . 	0
WD	11860	But you must donate so that I can build a better platform to get the word out that I can save people you must help me you must donate and don â t forget , don â t do this â¦ this and this â¦ or else you will not go anywhere remotely nice when you die . 	0
WD	11861	You know this sort of thing gets to me when people think that they are right about they â re religion or topics . 	0
WD	11862	Ignorance is truly bliss . 	0
WD	11863	Now in lieu of that last statement I am not saying that I am right in anyway shape or form . 	0
WD	11864	People are always afraid . 	0
WD	11865	Always thinking of death and what could or won â t happen next . 	0
WD	11866	Now if your scared enough and all of a sudden in what seems like coincidence , someone comes up to you and says hey you know what . 	0
WD	11867	I can save you I can save you from what â s to come . 	0
WD	11868	If a student wishes to silently pray during my class , I do not have a problem with it . 	1
WD	11869	I ' m a teacher . 	0
WD	11870	I also don ' t think teachers / administrators leading prayers over the intercom or whatever are acceptable . 	1
WD	11871	Sandy 	0
WD	11872	He admonished his followers : â Always beware of vowing , it is a risky thing . 	0
WD	11873	So why did we make all of the necessary sacrifices and send our four children through the private sector ? 	0
WD	11874	It ' s individuals like that who take away the right to choose and assuming it ' s just rich people who send their kids shows the ignorance in that statement . 	0
WD	11875	So , I guess we are bad parents because we put our faith in God first and foremost . 	0
WD	11876	The â evangelical prophet , â Oswald Chambers ( 1874 â 1917 ) , saw that the empty promises made by so many Christians actually result in great â spiritual leakage . â 	0
WD	11877	I agree that this article is a crock ! 	0
WD	11878	My wife and I are both school teachers . 	0
WD	11879	I worked in the public system , and she worked in the Catholic school system in our area . 	0
WD	11880	In fact many middle class and even lower income folks use private education for their children . 	0
WD	11881	If you can ' t manage that then enroll your children in an alternative school . . . it really is that simple . 	0
WD	11882	It also bids the argument that religion plays a roll and it ' s an obvious attack against those schools who are affiliated that way . 	0
WD	11883	The public school system is secular , keep your religious beliefs at home . 	1
WD	11884	Why not use public schools here are a couple reasons they teach liberal sex education , they teach evolution , they teach homosexuality generally at an early age , and some even hold classes about certain religions . 	0
WD	11885	How long until Muslim schools girls are told to stop exposing their face in school ? 	0
WD	11886	Do you have a better idea ? 	0
WD	11887	Use the comment field below to voice your opinion . 	0
WD	11888	I see benefit to both sides of the argument . 	0
WD	11889	I just don ' t know what the best option is . 	0
WD	11890	SO while the lower performing student has an aid , that high performing student is bored to tears and on a behavioral rampage . 	0
WD	11891	My daughter was 4 when she started kindergarten , turned 5 in late Sept . She thrived socially , but was definitely " middle of the pack " academically till the end of 2nd grade , when something kicked in , and she started caring more about doing well in school . 	0
WD	11892	Yes everyone can stand review but at a point you lose students . 	0
WD	11893	The students can opt out of their accomodations , and they do to save face , further , they are not only hurting themselves , but others in the calss . 	0
WD	11894	The resources teacher ( their aid ) can ' t sit by there side and give them the help and attention they need due to confidentiality . 	0
WD	11895	We have gotten away from this " tracking " mentality , but really , the majority or resource kids I see are no better off . 	0
WD	11896	I have 32 kids in one class and an on level class is mixed beyond belief . 	0
WD	11897	I can attest to the idea that things even out by 3rd grade . 	0
WD	11898	Few children can rise above the poor education of a public school and that is why most of our leaders attended private schools and why they send their children to private schools also . 	0
WD	11899	My kids both have nice professional jobs . 	0
WD	11900	I pay my school taxes but public schools don ' t want my input , just my money . 	0
WD	11901	I just disagree that if public schools went away , all these wonderful educational facilities would magically spring up and everyone would be educated and the world would be a better place to be . 	0
WD	11902	You will never , ever regret it . 	0
WD	11903	Nor will your child . 	0
WD	11904	If you can â t do that , explore the many good private Christian schools that are available . 	0
WD	11905	But please , consider doing something . 	0
WD	11906	Pressure to prepare kids for these tests starts as early as kindergarten . 	0
WD	11907	Later , as a parent , I changed direction and became worried about the behaviour that impeded learning and teaching in public schools- behaviour that I witnessed first hand . 	0
WD	11908	Consequently I chose to move my own children from public to private . 	0
WD	11909	I own up to being part of the problem of the weakening of the public system . 	0
WD	11910	I couldn ' t abide that my own values of respect , cooperation and high expectations were not being held for my children in the public system . 	0
WD	11911	The teachers in both systems are the same , but the expectations of the parents are simply different . 	0
WD	11912	I want for my children what my parents did not have to pay for ! 	0
WD	11913	If you have the ability to send your children to private school and choose not to , then it is clear that you love money more than your children . 	0
WD	11914	I helped paint classrooms and wash windows . 	0
WD	11915	Would a moment of silence be out of order ? 	0
WD	11916	This is absolutely the worst piece of garbage I have ever read ! 	0
WD	11917	We did without so we could send our kids to Catholic school . 	0
WD	11918	Why can ' t we have a moment of silence ? 	0
WD	11919	If public school parents don ' t like their ' crappy ' school then let THEM make changes . 	0
WD	11920	Other parents did landscaping , waxed floors , supervised recess , helped in the kitchen , repaired the furnace and water heater , maintained the school bus , and re-sealed the driveway . 	0
WD	11921	This is the way it has always been done in the Catholic school system . 	0
WD	11922	We have done our share . 	0
WD	11923	Where will that child be best prepared to succeed in college and beyond ? 	0
WD	11924	Like most certified teachers I did not hold this method of education in very high regard . 	0
WD	11925	If you wish to improve public schools the only answer is to get government out of education and turn it back to local control . 	0
WD	11926	, specifically my bias against homeschooling before doing the research . 	0
WD	11927	What is wrong with this country is public schools and people that believe that someone owes them something . 	1
WD	11928	This is not about real " choice " . 	0
WD	11929	When middle-class parents go private , they are supporting a shift that will see public schools become a residual system for the poor . 	0
WD	11930	I find it deeply offensive when parents imply that they send their kids to private schools because they care about them more . 	0
WD	11931	There ' s plenty of evidence to show that the best thing you can do for your kids is engage with them ( ie . more time at home , less time at work ) and make their home life an enriching one . 	0
WD	11932	How well a child does at school depends on the child itself not the school it goes to . 	0
WD	11933	Attitude to studies is all important . 	0
WD	11934	I send my kids to public schools because I care about them - their links with their diverse local community etc - but also because I care about the kind of culture they live in . 	0
WD	11935	To me , learning to care about and contribute to society as a whole - not just your own personal interests - is the best value a child can inherit . 	0
WD	11936	All of our kids deserve to reach their full potential , regardless of their sex . 	0
WD	11937	I have written more than a hundred articles for this column and this has never happened before . 	0
WD	11938	If a student ' s mind is occupied with sex , drugs and alcohol you can ' t expect good results . 	0
WD	11939	Set high moral standards for your child and encourage the proper attitude to study and life in general and it won ' t matter which school he / she attends . 	0
WD	11940	The next thing I know there are thousands of readers â recommending â my article on their Facebook pages . 	0
WD	11941	Then I did the research and found , for the most part , that they are doing a fine job and I said so . 	1
WD	11942	All of us , no matter our religious beliefs , need to pray that the law changes before more smart children are left behind . 	0
WD	11943	That has changed because of immigrants , the world just in general becoming smaller through computers , TV . , and people becoming more independent from their own study and reading . 	0
WD	11944	When I was a kid we learned religion in church , math , reading , history , etc . , in school and at home . 	0
WD	11945	What will Americans do when Arabs wear headscarves , burkas to public school as is happening in Europe ? 	0
WD	11946	Why are some people making it so difficult , demanding that religion be taught also in schools , alongside science ? 	0
WD	11947	We have some problems to face , don ' t we ? 	0
WD	11948	Notice these are only women ' s wear , which creates another gigantic problem of suppression of the female ( Americans think ) . 	0
WD	11949	The entire world has these problems , not just here in America , and we are the guineau pigs . 	0
WD	11950	Now just 38 per cent of Britons , according to a 2005 poll , believe in " a God " of any kind ( a further 40 per cent of people believe in " some sort of spirit or life force " , apparently , showing that the market for new-age waffly nonsense is still going strong ) . 	0
WD	11951	I can ' t remember the exact timeline ) homeschoolers to simply graduate . 	0
WD	11952	Why , because their parents pay for them to be there . 	0
WD	11953	After reading all the comments attached to this article I would like to address some of them : Thank you for your encouragement to homeschool my boys . 	0
WD	11954	In the end I would like to emphasise two things : 1 ) People have suggested that there are pros and cons , and yes , this is obviously true but the implication to some may be that all this ' washes out ' in the end . 	0
WD	11955	This is NOT true . 	0
WD	11956	Any decent school will have various other contacts . 	0
WD	11957	However , more importantly , a rounded upbringing includes children being involved in other extra-curricula activities that allows them all sorts of interactions with a wide variety of people . 	0
WD	11958	Science can be wrong , but by far I ' ll take science over anecdotal evidence . 	0
WD	11959	: ) Single-sex schools do not mean living in a monastry . 	0
WD	11960	Depending on who you speak to , there is also anecdotal evidence that there are significant risks in vaccination babies . 	0
WD	11961	But the science indicates that the risk is almost negligible . 	0
WD	11962	Again , do the research . 	0
WD	11963	Studies clearly establish that single-sex schools are , IN GENERAL , better for educational outcomes than co-ed schools . 	0
WD	11964	But â¦ 	0
WD	11965	And I thought , sure , because she ' s a bright kid who ' s supposed to be in 2nd grade . 	0
WD	11966	But I didn ' t say it . 	0
WD	11967	Many who say money is a factor are simply choosing to spend their resources on other things when they could spend it on freeing up the possibility of homeschooling . 	0
WD	11968	Oooo - I had to bite my tongue to keep from saying almost the same thing , in a similar situation recentl ! . 	0
WD	11969	I have a July ' 07 girl whom I am sending to kindergarten this fall . 	0
WD	11970	I swear if I hear one more time ( and I know I will ) about how advanced her kid is . . . 	0
WD	11971	I ' m just going to say " so why not move her to 3rd grade where she belongs ? " 	0
WD	11972	It went unsaid , but the message I got was that I was not doing the right thing , by sending mine . 	0
WD	11973	Many who say they are not temperamentally suited to homeschooling are using that as a smokescreen when the truth is they are not willing to exercise the patience and submit to the sacrifice needed to homeschool . 	0
WD	11974	I got into a conversation with another mom whose child was the same age , who was holding her daughter back . 	0
WD	11975	She was actually totally cool , said she was still kind of conflicted about her decision , respected others choices , etc . It was the other women there who jumped into our conversation and assured her that she was DEFINITELY doing the right thing , who annoyed me . 	0
WD	11976	My daughter does not let the overcrowded classrooms bother her . 	0
WD	11977	To this day , I believe it may be the most prophetic series I â ve ever delivered at Meck . 	0
WD	11978	I do not believe homeschooling is for everyone , nor the mark of whether you are a good parent . 	0
WD	11979	The children in the public system , some , not all , are just waiting to get out at the end of the day . 	0
WD	11980	I know there can be economic barriers to homeschooling . 	0
WD	11981	Only to be more frustrated because there were about 60 kids in the tutoring session who all had questions . 	0
WD	11982	. 	0
WD	11983	At least one child died . 	0
WD	11984	Terrified students huddled in classrooms . 	0
WD	11985	They called 911 . 	0
WD	11986	They texted and tweeted . 	0
WD	11987	Teachers locked doors and implemented emergency procedures . 	0
WD	11988	And at least one teacher chased the gunman out of the school â an act of bravery that possibly saved lives . 	0
WD	11989	As police try to make sense of the senseless , the school superintendent called on people to pray . 	0
WD	11990	It was a wise decision . 	0
WD	11991	But perhaps lost in the chaos is the irony that in American public schools â people are not allowed to pray . 	0
WD	11992	Liberals have successfully banished God from the classroom , replacing Him with the manmade god of secularism . 	0
WD	11993	The kids are coddled , have no responsibility with the school system in this area . 	0
WD	11994	I think it sends the wrong message . 	0
WD	11995	It drives me nuts . 	0
WD	11996	I am in no way " Wealthy " however I chose to send my children to private school that has a religion based background . 	0
WD	11997	After all , there are very few things one can do as a grown-up , short of joining a cloistered religious order , to be exclusively in a single-sex environment . 	0
WD	11998	I can learn and do schoolwork and still have time for loads of other experiences . 	0
WD	11999	They could do this at public schools but do not . 	0
WD	12000	The public school was a joke . 	1
WD	12001	So I think your argument needs a lot more supporting facts . 	0
WD	12002	It ' s a strange hangover from a time when Britain really was a majority Christian country . 	0
WD	12003	Seems to me that you would send your child to private school if you felt you had the means . 	0
WD	12004	Children in the public school systems ARE left behind , bullied , and not challenged enough in their own learning capabilities . 	0
WD	12005	Private teachers have more passion about teaching because they are free to write their own curriculum for each child based on developmental assessments and achievements to where each child is learning at the level they need to be at and not just a class as a whole . 	0
WD	12006	The teachers do not open up a text book and teach every child the same way . 	0
WD	12007	Sending your child to a private school is one of the best things you can do for them . 	1
WD	12008	Oh , but she â s gifted ? 	0
WD	12009	This isn ' t the place to argue about Planned Parenthood , but the things they say to children as young as ten are things that shouldn ' t be said without a parent ' s permission . 	0
WD	12010	I went Kâ12 to a terrible public school . 	0
WD	12011	Well , then , she â ll really be fine . 	0
WD	12012	You want the best for your child , but your child doesn â t need it . 	0
WD	12013	I understand . 	0
WD	12014	She will have support at home ( that â s you ! ) and all the advantages that go along with being a person whose family can pay for and cares about superior educationâthe exact kind of family that can help your crappy public school become less crappy . 	0
WD	12015	Schools everywhere are failing to crack down on issues like bullying , and failing a lot of other things too . 	0
WD	12016	I ' m on the homeschool side of the debate . 	1
WD	12017	Woahhh , guys , some of this is starting to get a little attack-y . 	0
WD	12018	For the purpose of this argument , I ' m referring to homeschooling as any kind of flexible education : online schools , unschooling , a hodge-podge of curricula from different places , anything . 	0
WD	12019	That said , I don ' t believe it ' s the best in every single case . 	0
WD	12020	There wasn â t even soccer . 	0
WD	12021	When I asked her about it , she said , â I think the absence of boys helped me personally because I was a shy kid , so being with all girls helped me discover myself more easily and become more outgoing without the pressure of trying to impress boys . â 	0
WD	12022	Some of you with different political backgrounds may disagree , but this is what I believe . 	0
WD	12023	But even beyond that , I see him being very enthusiastic about learning and I want to give him as many opportunities as I can to foster that curiosity . 	0
WD	12024	This involves more than just the memorization of facts . 	0
WD	12025	Even in the story in the original post , I think mainstreaming was a good thing . 	1
WD	12026	Now that this person has graduated from high school , he might not be able to go on and get the types of college degrees that his peers are pursuing but maybe he could be placed in some sort of work program or job training program to help him be as independent as possible . 	0
WD	12027	I agree with what other posters have said . . . it depends on the individual child and how high functioning they are . 	0
WD	12028	If the being in a mainstream classroom is good for them and doesn ' t interfere with other students ability to learn then it is a good thing . 	0
WD	12029	I would NEVER put my child in a public school system if I could place them in a private . 	1
WD	12030	As far as public schools go , WOW are you sure that your child will come home to you tonight ? ? ? ? ? ? 	0
WD	12031	My husband and I ( my parents too ! ) sacrificed a lot to give him this education . 	0
WD	12032	As a parent that sent her son to private schools , I feel this is totally wrong for her to make this judgment . 	0
WD	12033	His case was brought before the U . S . Supreme Court . 	0
WD	12034	So in some cases there ' s a safety issue . 	0
WD	12035	Tina 	0
WD	12036	So , come up with a different way to make the public systems in better shape ! 	0
WD	12037	The effect of this ruling is not just to eat away at the sacredness of the name of God , but to eliminate the sacredness and thereby the substance of the oath itself . 	0
WD	12038	Mr . Morley , writing in the Nation â s Business September 1961 , pointed out â the absurdity of having an official administer to others oaths in the sanctity of which he does not himself believe . â 	0
WD	12039	In other places , it ' s what kids will hear , and I ' m not talking about peers . 	0
WD	12040	While one child may choose an excellent set of friends and role models , another child might migrate toward the trouble makers . 	0
WD	12041	If he ' d stayed in preschool , it would have been another year of being the bad kid who couldn ' t play or socialize properly . 	0
WD	12042	His confidence has improved so much being in a big kid school and being able to easily do all the work . 	0
WD	12043	He met the cutoff to start at 4yo and we sent him . 	0
WD	12044	HIPPO ODS will never be socially en par with his peers , but was reading and writing and adding by 4yo . 	0
WD	12045	Had I a daughter , I would encourage her to find single-sex schools . 	1
WD	12046	The reg . 	0
WD	12047	Sheridan 	0
WD	12048	I ' m good with that . 	1
WD	12049	They do not impose significantly on the other traditions . 	0
WD	12050	Both are reasonable accommodations . 	0
WD	12051	Nobody is being influenced here - Muslim students are simply being given a place to pray . 	1
WD	12052	I see no issue here . 	0
WD	12053	Fact : Muslims pray five times daily , in a way which is not practical in a normal classroom setting . 	0
WD	12054	This is just silliness . 	0
WD	12055	For example , Jehovah ' s Witnesses commonly do not participate in the national anthem , because they only recognize the Kingdom of God . 	0
WD	12056	Fact : we make other appropriate accommodations for other faith groups . 	0
WD	12057	You will soon understand the failings of the public school system . 	0
WD	12058	The idea that I should consider a lower level of achievement for my children so that the public schools MIGHT improve is ridiculous . 	0
WD	12059	When you remove God you invite everything that is wicked to come in and destroy . 	0
WD	12060	I believe the demise of our schools are solely due in part to the removal of prayer in schools . 	1
WD	12061	Removal of prayer in schools is not a violation of the third amendmant . 	0
WD	12062	In a blog for Yahoo ! , Clayton writes that the real motivator behind downsizing special education classrooms by mainstreaming students with disabilities into general education classes is a desire to save money , not an effort to do what â s best for students with disabilities . 	0
WD	12063	The removal of prayer may not be the only cause of social ills , but the negative trends are certainly a symptom of the spiritual decline which is at their root . 	0
WD	12064	She always has the best advice , no matter the topic , and was so happy that I inquired about her opinion on the subject of our education . 	0
WD	12065	Overall , she was happy with the all-girls experience , thinking maybe four years would have been a little better than six , but self-discovery was her biggest gain out of the school . 	0
WD	12066	Of course , it all really depends on the person . 	0
WD	12067	I reached out to some of the girls that I have remained very close with , and their opinions differ from mine quite a bit . 	0
WD	12068	Olivia . 	0
WD	12069	My friend Olivia is as sweet as can be . 	0
WD	12070	Which uniform style are YOU wearing ? 	0
WD	12071	Anyone who was anybody carried their books in a Dylan â s Candy Bar tote , then of course the accusations would fly about who really started the trend and who was copying whom . 	0
WD	12072	EVERYONE had the same one ! 	0

WD	12086	I didn ' t know one person who did drugs at my co-ed high school , or know anyone who had access to drugs . 	0
WD	12087	The girls at my all-girls school got drugs from the boys they knew ( all outside of school , of course , as it was an all-girls school ) . 	0

WD	12100	Church may also be a good time for that kind of stuff . 	0
WD	12101	If there was a correct religion and we knew about it then everyone would most likely be it , don â t you think . 	0
WD	12102	You cannot be so ignorant to say that your religion no matter what it is , is the correct religion there is no proof that it is the correct one . 	0

WD	12109	@ calminthestorm . 	0
WD	12110	I certainly know more than 3 home educated people , non of which went off the rails , yet I could compile a huge list of children that attended school who did . 	0
WD	12111	As for social interacting , I used to go on camping trips , day trips , I would study with friends by rivers , in the woods , on the beach or just pop round to each others houses . 	0
WD	12112	It was such a positive and wonderful experience , my parents travelled far and wide to give me these experiences , for that I will always admire them ! 	0
WD	12113	For the record , my parents aren â t hippies , or God fearing Christians . 	0
WD	12114	Also to sate that home educating families are middle class could not be further from the truth , with four children and my father receiving a pitiful wage as a hill farmer and my mum being an unpaied housewife , they , nor I fall into the bizarre and inaccurate stereo type of a home educated family . 	0

WD	12117	As supporters of this campaign against public teachers unions , it only makes sense that the news media ignores important books such as The Public School Advantage : Why Public Schools Outperform Private Schools . 	0
WD	12118	Charter schools , vouchers for private schools , school and school district takeovers â virtually all right-wing school reform efforts attack public school teachers because they are unionized and therefore make a decent wage . 	0
WD	12119	Weakening unions is one key strategy in the thirty-year class war in which wealth has been transferred from the middle class and poor up the economic ladder to the wealthy . 	0
WD	12120	The news media will certainly give fair coverage to both sides of most labor disputes , but in feature coverage they give far greater voice to anti-union pundits , writers , politicians , theories and events than to those in support of unions . 	0
WD	12121	The news media , owned as they are by large companies , have come to share big business â disdain for unions , especially over the past thirty years . 	0
WD	12122	In the case of education , it â s just not so , but the news media filters out this important news for ideological reasons . 	0
WD	12123	One of the ideological tenets of the mass media is that the private sector always outperforms the public sector . 	0

WD	12125	Are private schools better or worse ? 	0
WD	12126	Should private schools be allowed to compete with public schools ? 	0
WD	12127	However , school vouchers are illegal in most states , so this solution is not available to most parents . 	0
WD	12128	The most common solution to this problem is called a school voucher , which is essentially a tax rebate for parents that they can use to pay private tuition . 	0
WD	12129	What do you think ? 	0
WD	12130	Many polls have indicated that the American public is supportive to the idea of school vouchers , but national teacher â s unions oppose them , and so far they have not become a mainstream alternative to public school . 	0
WD	12131	The primary obstacle to creating more private schools is cost . 	0
WD	12132	A private school can choose to create a new curriculum for auto mechanics if it wants to , and doesn â t need to ask the government for permission or funding . 	0
WD	12133	Many parents do not have enough money to both pay school taxes and pay for tuition at a private school . 	0

WD	12139	According to a report issued by the National Center for Education Statistics in spring 2011 , the scores for kindergarten entry were higher for delayed-entry kindergartners and on-time kindergartners than for repeating kindergartners . 	0
WD	12140	We find substantial variation in practices across schools , with schools serving larger proportions of white and high-income children having far higher rates of delayed entry , " noted the report , " The Extent , Patterns , and Implications of Kindergarten ' Redshirting , ' " issued in April 2013 . 	0
WD	12141	No thanks . 	0
WD	12142	If you don ' t believe that they are as bad as I think they are , then you need only pay close attention when you ' re in a situation where young people might be talking or better yet when they are at a check out register . 	0
WD	12143	Some parents are even delaying schooling to give their children a competitive advantage in sports , or to delay admission age to college . 	0

WD	12146	A joint study by the University of Virginia and Stanford University released in 2013 established a relationship between red shirting and socio-economic status and ethnicity . 	0

WD	12159	l think as parents of the child you have to be certain and confident that your child is ready to mainstream . 	0
WD	12160	We took him off meds and we have a strong behavior plan , he sees therapists , and it is hourly teaching and redirecting with him . 	0
WD	12161	Our goal is for him to not have a one on one by middle school . 	0
WD	12162	2 grades later , he still has a one on one aide but doing EXCELLENT . 	0
WD	12163	So the school got him a one on one para and it helped a bit . 	0
WD	12164	I ' ll be putting this view into practise when my daughter is old enough . 	0
WD	12165	Why can ' t we find a situation where he is happy AND can receive an appropriate education and related services ? 	0
WD	12166	The tragic case of Khyra Ishaq prompted Ed Balls to commission a review of home education in 2009 that was undertaken by Graham Badman . 	0
WD	12167	Thankfully , the teacher situation seems to have stabilized . 	0
WD	12168	Yet , they still seem ill-equipped to deal with behavior problems . 	0
WD	12169	The non-public school director has said repeatedly that we are welcome to take our child out of her school since she has a waiting list , whenever we have brought up concerns . 	0
WD	12170	( Our biggest concern was the revolving door that teachers were on in 2006 / 07 : 3 teachers quit in 1 year . ) 	0
WD	12171	The non-public school has a very unwelcome attitude towards parent involvement , and even to questions and concerns that parents may raise . 	0
WD	12172	The idea that child abuse can be thwarted by tightening laws about home education has been around for some time . 	0
WD	12173	It seems that Khyra ' s last hope was that the local authority ' s home education support team might intervene once her mother had withdrawn her from school . 	0
WD	12174	What does that tell ya about are public school system ? 	0
WD	12175	He reached the same conclusions as this week ' s serious case review â that the law be changed to ensure that social services speak to children to assess if home education is in their interests . 	0
WD	12176	My problem is when a parent doesn ' t put the effort in to socialize the kids , they are in too narrow of a group of friends and not allowed any friends out side of that group . 	0
WD	12177	They will take away your rights to homeschool based on the outcome of the testing , I think that ' s a good thing . 	0
WD	12178	I know in this state the kids have to pass a yearly assesment test . 	0

WD	12185	A TA once a week for a severly ADHD boy who became violent was NO GOOD . 	0
WD	12186	A TA once a week in my lessons for an sutistic boy was NO GOOD . 	0
WD	12187	In this age group ( senior high school ) , the benefits were larger and more consistent across the board for girls than for boys . 	0
WD	12188	The National Foundation for Educational Research conducted a study in which they observed and calculated of 2 , 954 high schools ( both co-ed and single-sex ) throughout England and found , " Even after controlling for students ' academic ability and other background factors , both girls and boys did significantly better in single-sex schools than in coed schools . 	0
WD	12189	It is very clear by the above chart that both sexes academically benefit from a single-sex education . 	0
WD	12190	But then we have studies that show the numbers . 	0
WD	12191	Advantages have not been demonstrated . " 	0
WD	12192	That ' s not to say that academic outcomes are definitively worse , but neither are they definitively better . 	0
WD	12193	Penn State ' s very own , psychology professor Lynn S . Liben claims there is no academic benefit to a single-sex education , " Our examination of the existing studies leads us to conclude that there is not scientific evidence for positive effects of single-sex schooling . 	0
WD	12194	So , while the single-sex atmosphere allowed young women at my school to branch out and express themselves without the restriction of the opposite sex , some may argue that it could have instilled an anxiety associated with the opposite sex . 	0
WD	12195	It ' s been proven that the per student cost basis in public schools is much higher than private schools . 	0
WD	12196	For higher-achieving boys , there was no statistically significant effect of school type on performance , positive or negative . " 	0
WD	12197	Specifically , girls at all levels of academic ability did better in single-sex schools than in coed schools ; whereas for boys , the beneficial effect of single-sex schools was significant only for boys at the lower end of the ability scale . 	0
WD	12198	Age wise I was right in the middle of my class at school and I was far ahead of my class . 	0
WD	12199	Yes , out public school system is broken , but until the PARENTS start caring and actively participating in the education of their children and stop making it solely the schools ' job , nothing is going to change . 	0
WD	12200	I remember when I went to public school and it just seemed that the teachers cared about more than their yearly raises and making sure the school got enough money each year from the government . 	0
WD	12201	However I feel that the school struggles to meet her needs due to lack of experience and always fighting for funding . 	0
WD	12202	I ran life skills groups and was always part of any meetings about trips , work experience , careers etc . I now work as a TA with a child with CP who is placed in a mainstream school appropriately so because despite physical and communication difficulties is very bright . 	0
WD	12203	Those with physical disabilitys but no additiona learning needs were fully intergrated into the class but because of the inclusive nature and an excellent senco adaptations could be made , e . g IT provision in every lesson , access to a scribe , extended time to sit exams and submit homework , leaving lessons a few minutes earlier to avoid the crush in the corridors . 	0
WD	12204	They were able to mix with their peers of all abilities at break times . 	0
WD	12205	The kids intergrated into the lessons they were able to and had lessons within the unit . 	0
WD	12206	One secondary school had a great system with a unit attached with a high ratio of TA ' s to children . 	0
WD	12207	I was a paediatric Occupational Therapist and worked in both special needs schools and mainstream environments and saw successes and failiures in both . 	0
WD	12208	I think it must be a mindfield for parents having to make this choice and despair at the battles they face for funding appropriate eductation for their children . 	0
WD	12209	I can see the benefits of both types of schooling for differnt children . 	0
WD	12210	More over , they will probably succeed in their work life no matter the school they attended . 	0
WD	12211	This is what ALL schools should aspire to be . 	0
WD	12212	There are true outliers in both directions based on personality vs when they started school . 	0
WD	12213	The single-sex education question is , at least in part , a legal one , but it is also a scientific one . 	0
WD	12214	The ACLU â s findings have led them to challenge the sex-segregated programs in several states and even file a lawsuit against a West Virginia program . 	0
WD	12215	As a result they were , in fact , decidedly unequal . 	0
WD	12216	Many of them relied on outdated and scientifically unfounded stereotypes of boys and girls to drive their curriculum . 	0
WD	12217	But , in the absence of high-quality research , why err on the side of segregation ? 	0
WD	12218	Perhaps if we do a better job of having the scientific conversation about whether or not single-sex education actually works we wouldn â t have to have the conversation about the legality . 	0
WD	12219	At the moment we simply don â t have sufficient evidence to say that single-sex education in the US actually works . 	0
WD	12220	I am the only quiet person in this loud family . 	0
WD	12221	I have little reason to think that one day , Ryan will wake up with a hushed demeanor . 	0
WD	12222	Hard though it may be to believe , the public school was better on these issues . 	0
WD	12223	Additionally , Ryan can have short attention span , especially if he â s bored . 	0
WD	12224	( Please , pass me another glass of wine ) . 	0
WD	12225	I worry some about her going off to college at age 17 , but the idea of a gap year at 17 to engage in a rewarding volunteer experience sounds better to me than an extra year spent in preschool would have been . 	0
WD	12226	( His hearing has been tested and , yes , he â s fine ) . 	0
WD	12227	I â ve often wondered â if God is good enough for the bad times , shouldn â t He be good enough for the good times ? 	0
WD	12228	Yet in times of great tragedy , school leaders inevitably seek guidance and solace from the same God they â ve expelled . 	0
WD	12229	Another issue is Ryan â s loudness . 	0
WD	12230	But his father is loud and so is his older sister . 	0
WD	12231	It â s as if he â s a broken volume button on an old radio , stuck on high no matter what . 	0
WD	12232	Now she ' s in 7th grade , and still at the top of her class . 	0
WD	12233	Our society has become so concentrated on how people FEEL . 	0

WD	12240	We need a moral adjustment , not a legislative one . ) 	0
WD	12241	There are a lot of reasons why bad people send their kids to private school . 	0
WD	12242	Everyone , all in . 	0
WD	12243	( By the way : Banning private schools isn â t the answer . 	0
WD	12244	None of these are compelling reasons . 	0
WD	12245	Or , rather , the compelling ones ( behavioral or learning issues , wanting a not-subpar school for your child ) are exactly why we should all opt in , not out . 	0
WD	12246	Yes , some do it for prestige or out of loyalty to a long-standing family tradition or because they want their children to eventually work at Slate . 	0
WD	12247	But many others go private for religious reasons , or because their kids have behavioral or learning issues , or simply because the public school in their district is not so hot . 	0
WD	12248	I believe in public education , but my district school really isn â t good ! 	0
WD	12249	you might say . 	0
WD	12250	We are also far from rich . 	0
WD	12251	Last week I learned the definition of â going viral . â 	0
WD	12252	I didn ' t feel equipped to teach him and he got nothing from my lessons , and when he was " blowing " neither did anyone else . 	0
WD	12253	There , I said it . 	0
WD	12254	Every single solitary teacher I ' ve spoken to about this says that any differential based upon age pretty much disappears by the time the child is in 3rd grade . 	0
WD	12255	I can see it right now at the end of second grade - to the extent there were differences because she was so young are completely eliminated . 	0
WD	12256	FWIW - I think for many kids you can tell in kindergarten and first . 	0
WD	12257	But being at the tail end of this , you can ' t tell after that . 	0
WD	12258	So the question is : Why do people hold their kids out a year when the District says this is when the kids go ? 	0
WD	12259	If you really can ' t tell - why don ' t you just follow the rules ? 	0
WD	12260	You honestly cannot tell the difference in the ages of the kids . 	0
WD	12261	Every once in a while a child might stand out but it ' s not that often and the reason they are standing out is usually not because they seem " older " or " younger " I don ' t necessarily disagree with you . 	0
WD	12262	The teacher says she can ' t tell any difference at all . 	0
WD	12263	As the temporary alliance between Liz Sayce and Maria Miller proves , this can make for some very unlikely bedfellows . 	0
WD	12264	BUT teaching in a class of 35 without support was silly . 	0
WD	12265	Preparing special work for the ADHD / Autistic / severely limited children was not a problem , a joy , really , and my job ! 	0
WD	12266	No wonder students who have been divided by sex for years need help learning how to work and learn together . 	0
WD	12267	Here â s the bottom line : many of our schools are in trouble and coming out of the largest recession since the 1930s , with mounting national debt , we have limited resources . 	0
WD	12268	Perhaps this outcome isn â t surprising . 	0
WD	12269	Social scientists have found that labeling and separating students based on almost any characteristic ( e . g . , sex , eye color , randomly assigned t-shirts ) makes those differences even more salient to the students and produces intergroup bias . 	0
WD	12270	Got that ? 	0
WD	12271	Instead of focusing on techniques that have been proven to improve academic outcomes , the school has to spend its limited resources teaching boys and girls to play well with each other . 	0
WD	12272	So , the right of kids to pray in school is not only not banned , but even constitutionally protected . 	0
WD	12273	In fact , the Bill of Rights â First Amendment protects both the right to freedom of speech ( prayer can obviously be a form of speech ) as well as the right to free exercise of religion ( praying also obviously qualifies as exercising one â s religion ) . 	0
WD	12274	Kids pray all the time in school ( often right before a quiz or exam ) . 	0
WD	12275	This is nonsense . 	0
WD	12276	The dearest private schools with long heritage of generations of pupils from the one family don ' t show it theses days . . . 	0
WD	12277	Sports on Saturdays music classes drama classes etc the catholic school that ' s says 95% is reflecting their area . . 	0
WD	12278	Having previously discussed why teaching creationism in public school science classes , or posting the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms , are both inappropriate and unconstitutional , I suppose it â s perhaps time now to take a look at the whole heated issue of the place of prayer in U . S . public schools . 	0
WD	12279	Article failed to justify the heading lost the plot along the way . . 	0
WD	12280	However , please note that these constitutionally protected legal rights and freedoms apply only to people , and not to the government . 	0
WD	12281	And , in actual fact , no one is officially disallowing kids to pray in school whenever they want ( so long as it isn â t disruptive , of course â a basic school rule that equally applies to other sorts of free speech and forms of self-expression ) . 	0
WD	12282	Today , parents who homeschool don ' t even worry about high school or diplomas . 	0
WD	12283	Still , it seems that should be some oversight to prevent children from falling through the cracks . 	0
WD	12284	Both sides of this debate have a compelling case . 	0
WD	12285	And it is entirely possible that some children might receive a better education at home than they would in any of the available schools they could attend . 	0
WD	12286	Unfortunately , for parents who cannot afford private education , live in certain suburbs or who want to send their children to a public school , the selective system is the only one that will nurture and encourage them to learn and grow amongst peers who want to learn . 	0
WD	12287	Parents should not be judged for trying to do what ' s best for their children . 	0
WD	12288	I also recognize that there are deep roots to explore when we look at who is attending private versus public schools , and it certainly bears looking at why people make those choices , rather than dismissing them as not compelling enough like Benedikt does . 	0
WD	12289	Using Benedikt â s rational , if everyone sent their kids to public schools they would somehow magically improve . 	0
WD	12290	And due to cost , location , waiting lists , and other issues , sometimes Catholic school or another private school is not an option ( though home schooling versus Catholic schools has been a whole other debate ) . 	0
WD	12291	Out in the Western suburbs , where we can afford to live , public high schools just won ' t do unless you ' re happy for your kids to be beaten up , spat on , thrown rocks at , and depressed going to a school full of delinquents who swear at teachers & disrupt the class all day . 	0
WD	12292	How can they learn and grow in such a place , even with high involvement and support from home ? 	0
WD	12293	Don ' t need statistics , just need to put your kids into the public school system to know they ' re being disadvantaged through under resourcing and teachers ill-equipped to deal with the policies they are meant to be managing , i . e . bullying , attire , social attitude , etc . The number of parents pulling their kids from the public system speaks for itself in how the public system is operating . 	0

WD	12302	However , it should be made clear that coeducation can also foster good mental and emotional situations . 	0

WD	12318	At 13 I would have said that of course girls need to be bossy -- who else would lead ? 	0
WD	12319	As far as prayer in school , I think a moment of silence to allow a private prayer of any type for anyone who wishes to give such is most appropiate . 	1
WD	12320	I took this attitude with me into high school , a building that sat next to an all-boys ' school . 	0
WD	12321	Some of my classes were coed . 	0
WD	12322	The boys came over for European history and drama , classes where I always positioned myself in the front row , preferring the " visiting " boys sit behind me . 	0
WD	12323	To my teenage self they were clearly infringing on my territory and I made sure I outperformed them . 	0
WD	12324	That confidence translated when I went next door for Latin , where I righteously covered my tests with my arm to make sure the boy sitting behind me couldn ' t cheat off of me ( a trick he only got away with once ) . 	0
WD	12325	When I arrived at Harvard ( also Sandberg ' s alma mater ) I was never afraid to raise my hand in a seminar , and I quickly learned that the best way to be heard meant jumping into the discussion and not waiting to be recognized . 	0
WD	12326	Most institutions now accept parents ' transcripts , letters from community members , SAT scores and entrance exam scores as proof of achievement . 	0
WD	12327	Colleges and universities are now recognizing that homeschooled children ' s education is as well-rounded as that of their peers . 	0
WD	12328	In the private school system , the administration is more able to deal with the difficult student , even if that mean expelling them from the school . 	0
WD	12329	All of these situations encourage development of social and conflict-resolution skills , expect courteous and respectful behavior and expose children to diversity . 	0
WD	12330	While it is true that they may not spend six hours of every day with same-age peers , many homeschooled children are from large families , are involved in extracurricular activities and lessons , and volunteer in the community . 	0
WD	12331	Socialization One of the most common arguments against homeschooling is that children who learn at home will not have opportunities to socialize with their peers . 	0
WD	12332	Others might purchase commercial online or DVD-based curricula . 	0
WD	12333	Some may hire a tutor or belong to a cooperative where parents take turns teaching in their area of expertise . 	0
WD	12334	This may have been accurate in the past but today , even if parents do not have the required skill set , they have many options . 	0
WD	12335	Meeting Academic Standards Another argument against homeschooling is that students may not be exposed to the same rigorous curriculum standards at home as they would be at school , which would make it difficult to be accepted at postsecondary institutions . 	0

WD	12350	And I do mean facts : Homeschooled children significantly outperform children educated in public school systems in reading , language , math , science and social studies . 	0
WD	12351	And I totally understand Benedikt â s line of thinking . 	0
WD	12352	Ultimately , we as a society lose . 	0
WD	12353	Our society just isn ' t gear for that . 	0
WD	12354	" I have studied how children learn and develop and have been in the field of early care and education for more than 30 years . 	0
WD	12355	CNN should not publish such nonsense . 	0
WD	12356	" This is just plain wrong . 	0
WD	12357	" Most research clearly shows that any gaps in levels of success between younger and older children are usually bridged by the third grade . 	0
WD	12358	As private individuals , kids today remain as free to pray in their schools as they have ever been ; in fact , their right to do so is constitutionally protected . 	0
WD	12359	So , if you studied this ( evidently , without much success ) , why so you resort to anecdotal information ? 	0
WD	12360	The greatest part of my knowledge comes from my own children . . " 	0
WD	12361	Those who can afford to bail on trying to improve the system and end up sending their children to private school rather than work on improving public ones . 	0
WD	12362	It â s just that it has been widely recognized that it is clearly unconstitutional for the state ( and , by extension , state schools ) to officially sanction , sponsor , offer , or conduct prayers . 	0

WD	12368	I am thank-ful I could afford to send them to a private school . 	0
WD	12369	And that ' s what scares these selfish people that want to take away people ' s freedom and start calling people names just because they are envious of what others have or do ! 	0
WD	12370	After all , the public school systems get tax money from everyone , even from the one ' s who send their kids to private schools . 	0
WD	12371	And the public school doesn ' t provide anything for those kids , but the system still takes their money . 	0
WD	12372	I have three children with kid ' s of the their own , one moved to be able to send his kids to a private school , the other home school ' s her children , while my other children still go to a public school . . . . but they ' re father is a teacher . . . . thank God ! ! 	0
WD	12373	public education is for the most part terrible , and it ' s too bad that our government had to step in and ruin what was working ! ! 	1
WD	12374	maybe someday we ' ll elect official ' s that give the people what they really want , instead of slamming they ' re own agenda ' s down our throat ! ! ! 	0
WD	12375	In some schools , mainstreaming of students with disabilities is used only for those classes in which the child has ability to keep up with peers , according to SEA . 	0
WD	12376	Maybe this woman needs to work and give all her money to the public school system so she won ' t be a bad person . 	0
WD	12377	The self consciousness hinders students from asking questions in class , and therefore students get more frustrated by not understanding the material . 	0
WD	12378	There is an event happening at schools all across the country later this month that , according to Freedom From Religion Foundation ( â FFRF â ) , people need to be warned about . 	0
WD	12379	Our entire public school system is nothing but a battleground controlled by hate and a hatred that is enforced by bullies . 	0
WD	12380	Our government is based upon hate . 	0
WD	12381	Our entire society is based upon hate . 	0
WD	12382	When you have an entire citizenry that has been raised to hate unto death their families , their neighbors and each other , then anybody with a brain in their heads is deemed " different " -- and not in the good way . 	0
WD	12383	But at least Benedikt acknowledges it : â I â m just judgmental . 	0
WD	12384	The best education is the only route to go ; and it isn ' t in a public school system . 	1

WD	12392	Her mother , my sister , has a masters in mathematics . 	0
WD	12393	She was in charge of all math programs , k through 12 , for nationally recognized public schools in a surburban D . C . county . 	0
WD	12394	She was offered teaching fellowships from both departments and went on to get a her graduate in French . 	0

WD	12404	I have to say that I am very sympathetic to home educaters . 	1
WD	12405	Just about every week cops are called to this school because of either a shooting / stabbing . 	0
WD	12406	I once read , admittedly in a pro-home-ed publication , that a child , if properly taught , can learn as much in two hours at home as a child could learn in an entire school day at a mainstream school . 	0
WD	12407	Back in the mid-nineties , when I was reporting on single-sex classrooms , evolutionary psychology was hot , and â hardwired â was the new buzz word , injected like a vitamin shot into weak arguments . 	0
WD	12408	I retired because I could no longer stand seeing children who desperately wanted to learn being thwarted by disruptive hoodlums . 	0
WD	12409	Additionally , private schools are not encumbered by national teacher â s unions or political correctness . 	0
WD	12410	Private schools that compete with each other for students will be forced to find the best teachers available , and will be able to offer flexibility that meets each individual â s educational needs . 	0
WD	12411	OTOH , one does read and hear about people who withdraw children from school because they have some dispute with the school about discipline ( school tries to , parents object ) or because the school has failed to address bullying concerns . 	0
WD	12412	We can test a child academically but we can never test their emotional readiness . 	0
WD	12413	They sometimes are not ready to leave home at the age of five and the separation anxiety will impact them for a long time . 	0
WD	12414	Usually not . 	0
WD	12415	The public school classroom may be one of the few . 	0

WD	12419	Church ? 	0
WD	12420	Where else in life do we spend such a large amount of time with only a group of people all the same age ? 	0
WD	12421	In the workforce ? 	0
WD	12422	Wouldn â t this be considered social opportunities ? 	0
WD	12423	Think about kids in the public school classroom spending six to seven hours of their day with a group of only their same-aged peers . 	0
WD	12424	Why wouldn ' t they ? 	0
WD	12425	You betcha I would have . 	1
WD	12426	School is a place of learning . 	0
WD	12427	Pray at home . 	1
WD	12428	I think private schools are great and hope a lot more come about . 	1
WD	12429	I am not an education policy wonk : I â m just judgmental . 	0
WD	12430	So , pretty bad . 	0
WD	12431	Not bad like murderer badâbut bad like ruining-one-of-our-nation â s-most-essential-institutions-in-order-to-get-what â s-best-for-your-kid bad . 	0
WD	12432	You are a bad person if you send your children to private school . 	1
WD	12433	Your children and grandchildren might get mediocre educations in the meantime , but it will be worth it , for the eventual common good . 	0
WD	12434	It could take generations . 	0
WD	12435	This would not happen immediately . 	0
WD	12436	But it seems to me that if every single parent sent every single child to public school , public schools would improve . 	0
WD	12437	The report that an increasing number of parents in this country are seeking to homeschool their children is not at all surprising . 	0
WD	12438	However , some persons expressed confusion about this admission from an official of the Ministry of Education recently , because of the high standard of education we afford our children at the nursery , primary and secondary levels . 	0
WD	12439	But rich people will always find a way to game the system : That shouldn â t be an argument against an all-in approach to public education any more than it is a case against single-payer health care . ) 	0
WD	12440	( Yes , rich people might cluster . 	0
WD	12441	The media coverage here and abroad about bullying , teasing as well as physical and emotional abuse in public schools is abundant , and it could make a parent want to protect their children from that bad environment . 	0
WD	12442	Certainly there are advantages and disadvantages to homeschooling and if it is an area that is gaining currency in this country , the relevant authorities will need to do some probing to ensure that parents are giving their children instruction in the right manner , and are not in fact putting their children at a disadvantage . 	0
WD	12443	Unless there are individual circumstances I wouldn ' t be sending my children to a single sex school . 	1
WD	12444	Indeed , if homeschooling is really on the rise , Government may have to seek parliamentary approval to institute laws and regulations to govern this method of teaching . 	0
WD	12445	Yet most slum dwellers would much prefer their governments to open schools . 	0
WD	12446	Low-cost private schools thrive in very particular contexts ; for example , they flourish in illegal slum settlements in marginal urban areas , where governments fail to provide public schools because they do not recognise the settlements . 	0
WD	12447	Simple analysis shows that this is the result of the government failing to invest in education . 	0
WD	12448	Low-cost private schools are also evident in other contexts : for example , where government services are largely absent , such as in rural Pakistan . 	0
WD	12449	In doing this , the DFID is following in the ideological footsteps of the World Bank . 	0
WD	12450	Over the past three years , the Department for International Development ( DFID ) has made the controversial move to support low-cost private schools in some countries , such as Nigeria , Ghana , or Pakistan , where public education systems are in desperate need of investment . 	0
WD	12451	This begs the question of whether or not is it a good use of public money from UK taxpayers to invest speculatively in for-profit private schools in poor countries ? 	0
WD	12452	Indeed , a recent DFID Guidance Note on low-cost private schools argues that such schools have a key role to play in expanding education provision , despite acknowledging the fact that â there is still a lack of data and comparative analysis on education outcomes to assess value for money â . 	0
WD	12453	I support public school with my taxes and do help the public schools by lowering their class size with one less child . 	0
WD	12454	It certainly is not surprising , therefore , that Christian parents and those who have strong belief systems choose to homeschool their children instead of their developing questionable values in the public school system . 	0
WD	12455	I want my child to have a education that supports my religious beliefs and reinforces what I teach at home . 	0
WD	12456	In this context DFID ought to be making the case for increased domestic investment , as it is the only sustainable solution . 	0
WD	12457	Pakistan spends only 2 . 4% of its gross domestic product ( GDP ) on education against a benchmark of good practice of 6% of GDP . 	0
WD	12458	Then , in first grade , we asked he be placed in inclusive classrooms for non-academic subjects with an aide . 	0
WD	12459	He made academic gains and seemed very happy . 	0
WD	12460	The first year was great . 	0
WD	12461	So he ended up in a segregated , structured special ed . classroom . 	0
WD	12462	We didn ' t know the questions to ask , period . 	0
WD	12463	First of all , we didn ' t know he had a right to inclusion . 	0
WD	12464	In real life , it hasn ' t worked so well for my son . 	0
WD	12465	In theory , I absolutely support inclusion . 	0
WD	12466	What a hypocritical message we send to our children when we allow laws to be passed which limit the free expression of speech in public by banning public prayer in classrooms . 	0
WD	12467	Federal and Supreme Court judges should be impeached who undermine the freedom upon which this country was founded . 	0
WD	12468	He didn ' t have any friends among the peers without disabilities . 	0
WD	12469	By the second semester , it became apparent he was slipping behind academically in his special ed . classes . 	0
WD	12470	But that ' s a whole bag opened : why do some parents not care ? 	0
WD	12471	âbut there is always going to be bullying . 	0
WD	12472	On the other hand , some parents were fabulous , agreeing to hand me the leads to the X-Box until I decided the work had improved , or calling on my phone in my lesson to check up . 	0
WD	12473	That , not race , is the difference . 	0
WD	12474	It ' s not something I expect to improve under this government , which has already basically written off a whole sector of society as not worth it . 	0
WD	12475	the fact that they feel comfortable enough telling me is testament to this fact . 	0
WD	12476	It â s a lesson I sadly suspect our nation â s educators will never learn . 	0
WD	12477	âThe boys forget how to act around women and go cuckoo bananas when they go on a field trip together âmany girls complain about it ; however , many others have told me that they like it because they are insecure about " being bad readers " and feel more comfortable in an all-girls environment . 	0
WD	12478	The fervency with which school prayer is opposed is not because the ACLU ( an anti-Christian legal group ) is trying to protect atheist from being indoctrinated by religion . 	0
WD	12479	I teach single sex classes to 7th and 8th grade students IN the Bronx similar to in the article and here is what I ' ve found . 	0
WD	12480	Humanism assumes that the supernatural does not exist and that reality must be discovered purely from man ' s reasoning . 	0
WD	12481	Our public school system has been operating on this foundation since prayer was removed in 1962 . 	0
WD	12482	Since prayer was eliminated from public schools , the quality of education has shown a steady statistical decline . 	0
WD	12483	Is there a link between the two ? 	0
WD	12484	It tells students that they are more than just a collection of chemicals and energy that happen to be occupying space and time . 	0
WD	12485	Returning prayer to school would be an affront to this philosophy because prayer acknowledges the existence of someone greater than man . 	0
WD	12486	Allowing prayer in school sets an important standard . 	0
WD	12487	As much as I hate a lot of things that happen in public education , give me that stupidity over the utter lunacy of teaching kids about invisible father figures in the sky . 	0
WD	12488	Of course , then they could learn about the earth being flat and that big flood too . 	0
WD	12489	You mean when most children weren ' t educated at all , they just worked on their parent ' s farm and a large percentage never learned to read or write ? 	0
WD	12490	Let ' s face facts , if we did away with public education , most private schools are religious these days , that ' s where people would have to turn . 	0
WD	12491	I know that there are plenty of homeschoolers who turn out just fine . . . but I ' ve never met them in reality . 	0
WD	12492	Again , I do apologize if anyone finds this offensive in any way . 	0
WD	12493	Because I was never allowed to socialize with them as a child . 	0
WD	12494	Why ? 	0
WD	12495	One was the youngest in his class . 	0
WD	12496	By the way I taught in the public schools for over twenty-five tears . 	0
WD	12497	Academically he did great , valedictorian when he graduated . 	0
WD	12498	coed OR single sex is not going to change any of that because 13 year old girls are the devil âyou spend an inordinate time talking about medal of honor / twilight 	0
WD	12499	I held him back because he couldn ' t sit still . for 2 minutes . 	0
WD	12500	The other is the 2nd oldest in his class . 	0
WD	12501	After thousands of bedtime stories and hundreds of trips to the library , books were only as good as the pictures . 	0
WD	12502	In fact , The National Home Education Research Institute ( NHERI ) reports that homeschoolers actually participate in approximately five different social activities outside the home on a regular basis : boy / girl scouts , dance , swimming lessons , Sunday School , 4-H , homeschool co-ops , sports , theater , music classes and field trips . 	0
WD	12503	Honestly ? 	0
WD	12504	I do however think that one of the biggest pros to homeschooling though ( for those who do it properly and not take advantage of the way the system works ) is that kids can learn at their own pace w / o having to slow down or speed up to suit another child in their class . 	0
WD	12505	More students attending public school doesn â t automatically mean more involved parents either . 	0
WD	12506	How would you feel about you 6th grade daughter being in the classroom with a 17 year old predator ? 	0
WD	12507	I went to both , public and private . 	0
WD	12508	The essential difference were the students . 	0
WD	12509	And it makes all the difference . 	0
WD	12510	How would you feel about your child having to endure being bullied and taunted daily and when he reports it to the teacher nothing is done to the bully but your kid gets the snot beaten out of him ? 	0
WD	12511	I wholeheartedly support public education and in fact , our plans include sending our son to public middle and high school . 	1
WD	12512	Or â¦ they â d be overcrowded . 	0
WD	12513	The way the current system works , schools in lower-class neighborhoods are overcrowded and underfunded , while schools in wealthier districts enjoy the benefits of higher taxes â and yet , even many of them are also underfunded . 	0
WD	12514	I wish we had a better way to fund schools then based on property lines and tax dollars . 	0
WD	12515	Benedikt , in her push to help promote public education , seems to think that the best way to fix the public school system is to shame parents into sending all the kids there . 	0
WD	12516	And when you complain you will be told that there are procedures that must be followed . 	0
WD	12517	The current formula for funding public schools doesn â t automatically mean a bunch more money per school for each new student who enrolls . 	0
WD	12518	Overcrowding public schools isn â t going to solve anything . 	0
WD	12519	Every school function I went to most all the parents couldn ' t speak English and the kids would act like they was a little gang member or something . 	0
WD	12520	So , the data about the high percentage of the home-schooling students that graduate and that attended top universities such Harvard , Stanford , Yale , etc . is based on those students I saw in that award ceremony . 	0
WD	12521	No more will she ever go to a public school again . 	1
WD	12522	My children went to Catholic School so they could receive a religious education , attend mass daily , be safe , and learn . 	0
WD	12523	And she always said the Mexican kids was really mean to her . 	0
WD	12524	In public school she was the only Caucasian kid in her class in third grade . 	0
WD	12525	This will be her second year . 	0
WD	12526	Their teaching methods , no matter how hard I tried to understand , just did not work for me . 	0
WD	12527	As a disabled person with an interest in politics , the conversation sometimes turns to education . 	0
WD	12528	I have a right as an American to send my children to private school and by the way we are not rich by ant means . 	0
WD	12529	The media often frame the argument as one of â integration â and â segregation â . 	0
WD	12530	However , I personally feel that this is a gross oversimplification which sometimes leads those who proclaim to be allies of the disabled down risky paths . 	0
WD	12531	This was made clear to me last year when disabled charities advocated the closure of the Remploy factories on similar grounds . 	0
WD	12532	I tried SO hard to understand , I didn â t want to be â behind â the other kids , but it was no good . 	0
WD	12533	Not having it . . . . . . So you can judge and tell me I ' m wrong , but my kid is making way better grades then she was when she was in public schools . 	0
WD	12534	This week , examiner . com is having a promo called , â The Great Debate : to homeschool or not . â 	0
WD	12535	Why are public educators and superintendents concerned about the growing number of parents who are homeschooling their kids ? 	0
WD	12536	No matter how hard I tried it was not good enough . 	0
WD	12537	Public schools are help hostage by state and federal govenments . 	0
WD	12538	I was home educated from aged 10 onwards ; my parents were the most fantastic , enthusiastic teachers . 	0
WD	12539	Despite the best efforts of teachers and administrators they have no control over curriculum , what happens in the classroom , discipline , or anything else . 	0
WD	12540	Public schools are not influenced by parents , that ' s hooey . 	0
WD	12541	My personal experience of mainstream school was damaging . 	0
WD	12542	My parents didn â t take me out of school to â protect me from the world â , good grief what a stupid thing to do ! 	0
WD	12543	I wrote this paragraph on a prior commentary because it is a fallacy that a great percentage of the home-schooling students attended top universities : I disagree that all the public schools in Maryland are bad . 	1
WD	12544	The most obvious reason is that with fewer students enrolling in public school , there will be lesser funds going into the system . 	0
WD	12545	Also remember that there â s more to education than what â s taught . 	0
WD	12546	Being Jewish , nun wasn â t really an option . 	0
WD	12547	Thanks in part to Sandberg and her Facebook team , I know that many of the girls I attended middle and high school with have made a variety of different choices as women : some are married , many have children , and some are stay-at-home moms while others are doctors or lawyers ( one even premiered at the Metropolitan Opera this month , while still nursing her five-month-old son ) . 	0
WD	12548	But we can know how people assess their experiences -- like me and my former classmates . 	0
WD	12549	This knowledge and the confidence that comes with it can ' t be discounted . 	0
WD	12550	I wasn â t going to an all-women â s college , and how many jobs are there where there are strictly women in the workplace ? 	0
WD	12551	Other studies have acknowledged that all-girls ' education doesn ' t necessarily improve academic performance , but they haven ' t found that it hurts either . 	0
WD	12552	Short of being able to do twin experiments ( where one identical twin goes to a coed school and the other goes to a single-sex school ) , we may never know the precise effect of what learning in a single-sex environment does for girls . 	0
WD	12553	A well-publicized 2011 Science paper disagreed , proclaiming that single-sex education can have a long-term negative effect by promoting gender stereotypes . 	0
WD	12554	And while we ' re at it , ladies , it ' s also worth remembering that shaving your legs every day isn ' t a necessity -- and not doing so leaves more time for all kinds of leaning in . 	0
WD	12555	Of course not . 	0
WD	12556	In fact it â s part of the reason I feel so strongly about public schools . 	0
WD	12557	Give me a break ! 	0
WD	12558	His argument was that because girls are more structured and academically oriented than boys that more girls in the classroom would give the boys more â positive school behavior â to model . 	0
WD	12559	In study conducted by Mieke Van Houte ( 2004 ) he examined whether or not the presence of girls affected the achievement and behavior of boys . 	0
WD	12560	Boys take a more laid-back approach , work less hard , and are distracted more quickly . 	0
WD	12561	â In general it is stated that girls spend more time doing homework , display less disturbing behaviour in the classroom and play truant less often . 	0
WD	12562	I believe the far more important thing to consider in the single-sex vs . coeducational debate is whether or not the attitudes and emotions of the children involved are adversely or positively affected . 	0
WD	12563	It has been noted in the previous sections that single-sex education can provide a more structured learning environment for both boys and girls . 	0
WD	12564	So maybe the debate really has no footing at all , maybe it is just inherent that boys do not like school as much as girls ? 	0
WD	12565	â Recently , various studies have demonstrated that boys are less motivated than girls and hold less positive attitudes towards school than girls ( Van Houte , 2004 ) . â 	0
WD	12566	In another study conducted by Salomone ( 2006 ) she states â There is some indication that single-sex classes may develop greater self-confidence and broader interests especially among adolescents â¦ . girls report that they feel more comfortable â¦ interact more with teachers â¦ and develop more favorable attitudes towards these subjects ( math and science ) . â 	0
WD	12567	( Van Houte , 2004 ) â The study found that indeed the more girls that are in the classroom , the better the boys perform ( Van Houte , 2004 ) , it also found out that it is not so much the mere presence of girls as it is the proportion of girls . 	0
WD	12568	Some children , depending on disposition , may enjoy a single sex school more as they may not make friends from the other sex easily , and being solely around children of their own sex could develop their self-confidence . 	0
WD	12569	Advantages to sending your child to a single sex school include : children will be encouraged to learn how to interact with the other sex , despite not being able to interact every day . 	1
WD	12570	They are also exposed to how different the opposite sex can be , and how to cope with situations that come with being in a co-ed school . 	0
WD	12571	Children are able to interact daily with those from the opposite sex , allowing them to develop their social skills and have a variety of friendships . 	0
WD	12572	Let â s look at the advantages to sending your child to a co-ed school . 	1
WD	12573	Since each child is different , there is no specific formula to decide on a school . 	0
WD	12574	Since , the ultimate decision lies with the parents , focus needs to be on how the child would respond to either type of school , based on their personality , interests and general likes and dislikes . 	0
WD	12575	Parents often debate this issue , with many having issues with both co-ed and single sex schools . 	0
WD	12576	The author completely misses the reason why I send my children to private school as well as how to help the education system as a whole . 	0
WD	12577	Being aware of your child â s personality is crucial in determining which school you should choose , regardless of whether its co-ed or single sex , since a school â s academics , sports and cultural activities are vital issues . 	0
WD	12578	I couldn ' t come up with a more illogical argument . 	0
WD	12579	Parents of private school kids know absolutely nothing would change in the few years their children would attend a public school , even if they voiced their concerns . 	0
WD	12580	So , why waste valuable development years in a childs life when a parent could enroll their child in a private school and give them a better education immediately ? 	0
WD	12581	Seriously , do you think the same teachers who continually go on strike for better wages and less demanding grading scales would listen to parents and actually incorporate suggested changes into their classrooms ? 	0
WD	12582	Unfortunately that has me paying for my children to attend private school , and me paying for BOTH types of education . 	0
WD	12583	A 2009 study by professors at UCLA ' s Graduate School of Education & Information Studies presented data that graduates of all-girls ' schools show stronger academic orientations , especially in math and computer skills , and higher standardized tests scores , than their coed counterparts . 	0
WD	12584	But there was actually a gross violation of the third commandment by the U . S . Supreme Court a year earlier . 	0
WD	12585	When asking friends about whether they preferred public or private schooling for their children I got varied responses : some moved to be near a good public school , others sent their children to private schools because they wanted better discipline and to give them a social and professional head-start for when they left school , and one had tried both and saw pros and cons in each system . 	0
WD	12586	Then there are the fees for education . 	0
WD	12587	On the other hand , when your child excels in a particular area , such as music , languages or sports , or you want your child to have a spiritual education , it might be worth considering schools that have a curriculum focusing on those subjects . 	0
WD	12588	Most of those are private . 	0
WD	12589	Debate constantly rages about public funding of private schools , regardless of the school â s wealth raised from fees and donations . 	0
WD	12590	Money will definitely be an issue for us to consider when it comes to deciding which school our sons will attend . 	0
WD	12591	Public schooling is by-and-large free , with voluntary annual fees at around several hundred dollars . 	0
WD	12592	Private schooling costs thousands of dollars . 	0
WD	12593	When all the evidence for public and private schooling is boiled down , I think the most important factors are sending your children to a school where they are safe , secure and will receive a good education from high calibre teachers . 	0
WD	12594	There are schools in both the public and private systems where these factors are paramount , so it is up to us as parents to find the school that ticks as many of our boxes as possible . 	0
WD	12595	Not to mention do you really think anyone wants to pay taxes for the public system and pay huge $ for the private education . 	0
WD	12596	It ' s just like everything else the government has involvement with , failure ! ! 	0
WD	12597	He began to start not caring about school itself , he was very bored . 	0
WD	12598	I ended up pulling him out in 5th Grade into to private education through High School . 	0
WD	12599	I had several issues with the public education system not being able to keep up with my son who happened to be 3 grades ahead of his age level . 	0
WD	12600	Many conversations with the Principal and teachers . 	0
WD	12601	I made 7 . 50 / hr and was able to get an income based grant through the school . 	0
WD	12602	It was the best investment I had made . 	0
WD	12603	Or recite over and over " there is no God ? " 	0
WD	12604	And so , some may argue that single-sex education promotes gender-issued stereotypes . 	0
WD	12605	After just two weeks , the researchers reported that children who had the teacher using sex-specific language played less with children of the other sex . " 	0
WD	12606	My proposed solution would be to create co-ed , public schools that separate the sexes for the subjects of math and science ( debatably the two hardest , most demanding subjects taught in high school and the subjects that evoke the stereotype threat ) and create co-ed environments for all the other subjects . 	0
WD	12607	At the end of the day is it up to the parents : sacrifice your child ' s appreciation and cooperation with the opposite sex for a more specialized , concentrated academic environment ? 	0
WD	12608	This utopian schooling system would essentially provide the best of both worlds . 	0
WD	12609	Then , teachers could focus on targeting the needs for each sex when it comes to math and science , and incorporate both males and females for all other aspects of high school life . 	0
WD	12610	As a former educator , I believe that every child deserves equal access to education in the least restrictive environment possible . 	0
WD	12611	Private schools succeed where public schools fail largely because in a public school the teacher ' s hands are tied by politically correct nonsense . 	1
WD	12612	These hardly constitute the totality of private schools in this country . 	0
WD	12613	So before drawing any definitive conclusions , we need to know how other private schools compare . 	0
WD	12614	Perhaps a study by Luis Benveniste , Martin Carnoy and Richard Rothstein provides an answer . 	0
WD	12615	They concluded that " the social , cultural , and economic backgrounds of the parents and the community in which the school was located seemed to be the main determinant of variation , much more so than a school ' s public or private character or , within the latter group , whether it was religious or secular " ( All Else Equal , RoutledgeFalmer , 2003 ) . 	0
WD	12616	In short , they operate entirely differently . 	0
WD	12617	Therefore , I ' ll go a step farther . 	0
WD	12618	Even when socioeconomic factors are controlled , I don ' t think it ' s fair to compare private schools with public schools . 	0
WD	12619	I also hasten to note that most of the schools in the Lubienskis ' study were religious schools . 	0
WD	12620	We live in between two very highly-regarded public schools , and he will probably attend the local primary school as it is walking distance from our house and many of his friends from day care will be going there too . 	0
WD	12621	AND , then other schools down the line , like The Freshman Academy , are forced to spend their limited resources undoing the damage done by single-sex classes rather than , again , implementing proven techniques to expand academic achievement . 	0
WD	12622	I wasn ' t equipped to deal with a lad with lowered learning and physical disabilities that meant he " broke " really easily either , and seeing him fitting and falling from the chair in my lesson easily rates as one of the scariest moments of my life , until the support got there . 	0
WD	12623	Where does that child get the best education ? 	0
WD	12624	What matters is what is best for that child ' s personality ? 	0
WD	12625	In all honesty , it does not matter which avenue of education grants the best socialization . 	0
WD	12626	You don ' t sit next to them everyday , so you make time to spend with them no matter where they live . 	0
WD	12627	Deep connections are encouraged because you must go out of your way to see your friends . 	0
WD	12628	Some families homeschool year round , taking a month off between semesters to visit family and friends who live out of state . 	0
WD	12629	The opportunities to socialize quite likely outnumber those of public school because of the flexible time schedules . 	0
WD	12630	There is football , cheerleading , sign language , music , etc . There are field trips , playdates , study groups , Bible studies , conferences ( for all ages , not just the parents ) , and the list goes on . 	0
WD	12631	You know the rules , so if you take a job that makes you an agent of government , you need to respect the Constitution . 	0
WD	12632	Carry your Bible and pray if you want , but do it privately . 	1
WD	12633	I would have thought that a Christian would respect the rights of others , especially the rights of children . 	0
WD	12634	The teach in a private school or don ' t teach . 	0
WD	12635	All this time I thought it was God who was supposed to be worshiped . 	0
WD	12636	Not so with Bible thumping literalists . 	0
WD	12637	But much of it is mythology . 	0
WD	12638	Then you can continue to worship your silly book . 	0
WD	12639	Talk to your child about the routine in kindergarten and give him or her a schedule using pictures or words , depending on your child â s reading level . 	0
WD	12640	Ask the teacher if you can take photos of the room . 	0
WD	12641	â See if you can meet the teacher before September . 	0
WD	12642	And there are many ways ( beyond the myriad children â s books on the subject ) to help prepare your child . 	0
WD	12643	He was fine , and somehow thrived . 	0
WD	12644	I sobbed when I dropped our son off on his first dayânot delicate weeping , but chest-heaving sobs . 	0
WD	12645	As with so many things in parenting , you can only be so prepared . 	0
WD	12646	The more your child and you know , the more comfortable everyone will be when starting this new chapter . â 	0
WD	12647	only God himself can turn this world around and i believe He is tired of all the corruption caused by man . 	0
WD	12648	He is soon to return so we all need to be ready when He comes . 	0
WD	12649	hi . i am a 35year old lady who would love to see prayer back in the schools . 	1
WD	12650	i am writing a paper for my college writing class about the situation . 	0
WD	12651	invite the Lord in and watch the transformation . 	0
WD	12652	prayer should be done openly and privately . 	0
WD	12653	please lets get prayer back in the schools to eliminate all the violence . 	1
WD	12654	I mean why not ? 	0
WD	12655	I have a great solution to this problem - 3 day weekends anyone ? 	0
WD	12656	In Canada , no Christian would ever have to choose between going to Sunday service , and going to school . 	0
WD	12657	I didn ' t . 	0
WD	12658	Did you know that schools are still legally required to make children perform acts of Christian worship in schools ? 	0
WD	12659	Which is why it came as something of a shock to read today that " the vast majority of schools are flouting the law by failing to stage a daily Christian assembly " . 	0
WD	12660	I had no idea . 	0
WD	12661	Parents can opt their kids out , but the children themselves have no say in the matter . 	0
WD	12662	Apparently , under the 1944 Education Act , it is required that schools provide â broadly Christian worship â every schoolday . 	0
WD	12663	I vaguely remember some at primary school , but that was a CofE-run establishment so it ' s hardly surprising . 	0
WD	12664	I was surprised to learn that , because when I was at secondary school â a reasonably ordinary comprehensive in Oxford â there was , to my memory , not a single prayer assembly in the five years I was there . 	0
WD	12665	Assuming my experience was at least vaguely representative of the nation ' s , this is hardly a new situation . 	0
WD	12666	I left school a dozen years ago . 	0
WD	12667	Jewish prayer in schools is not a problem , because their Holy day is Saturday , also a day when there is no school . 	0
WD	12668	I don ' t know . 	0
WD	12669	It ' s certainly better than letting religion brainwash your children , which seems to be the other alternative . 	0
WD	12670	Christians , this is not a time to bring up the â if prayer should be in schools â debate , because it â s a worthless cause . 	0
WD	12671	Instead , let â s teach people what it means to pray , even if that means not being seen at all . 	0
WD	12672	You don â t need to have your prayer mandated by schools or government , but you also don â t need to draw attention to yourself while praying . 	0
WD	12673	Done ! 	0
WD	12674	Prayer that doesn â t change the one praying isn â t prayer either . 	0
WD	12675	When prayer left the schools it reminded the church that prayer is the Christian â s responsibility and not the governments . 	0
WD	12676	It made parents , Sunday school teachers and pastors teach the students what prayer really was , and it is a lot different than some recited sentences once a day or scenes in the smoking section . 	0
WD	12677	It made us rethink what prayer should look like , and rethink what Jesus meant when he said prayer shouldn â t be on the street corners making scenes but in our rooms in private . 	0
WD	12678	" The student will develop a persona that they are always bigger , better , and have the upper hand , which might be challenging in their future , " she said . 	0
WD	12679	This is a large developmental gap when trying to get through the state standard curricula , " said Vela . 	0
WD	12680	There are mixed results on whether redshirting is helpful for the child in the long run . 	0
WD	12681	" Even though most school districts want the child to be at least at the age of five , the cut-off date for joining differs according to school district and state , " said Vela . 	0
WD	12682	Effects are highest for low income students and males . " 	0
WD	12683	Redshirting poses challenges not only to children but to teachers and parents . 	0
WD	12684	Alternately , estimates suggest that entering kindergarten early may also have detrimental effect on future outcomes . 	0
WD	12685	They are dealing with children of ages ranging between four and a half and six and a half . 	0
WD	12686	" The teacher is mostly impacted by it . 	0
WD	12687	The philosophy involves bringing support services to the child within the classroom instead of taking the student to the services , and stipulates only that the child will benefit from being in the classroom . 	0
WD	12688	The Special Education Advisor blog defines mainstreaming as â selective placement of special education students in one or more â regular â education classes . â 	0
WD	12689	You know who else wants those things ? 	0
WD	12690	Philosophies and policies for carrying out the law vary , though . 	0
WD	12691	The override has been cut down the past two attempts but they ' re urging citizens to vote yes . . . . even though they just approved $150 , 000 for the purchase of additional visitor bleachers at our local high school football field . 	0
WD	12692	Inclusion , the philosophy Adelman prefers , is defined by SEA as â the commitment to educate each child , to the maximum extent appropriate , in the school and classroom he or she would otherwise attend . â 	0
WD	12693	The law requires that children with disabilities be educated with children who are not disabled to the extent that is appropriate . 	0
WD	12694	As Edmund Burke , correctly noted in 1795 , " All it takes for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing . " 	0
WD	12695	Whenever the opportunity arises to support the public acknowledgement of God by prayer ( or any other means ) , it benefits all of society to take a vocal stand . 	0
WD	12696	As with all truths , this is still applicable today . 	0
WD	12697	Our nation was founded on the freedom to publicly acknowledge God ' s existence . 	0
WD	12698	The situation has become so absurd that congressional prayers cannot be voluntarily read in a school building . 	0
WD	12699	Our experiment with replacing affirmation of God ' s existence with atheistic humanism has been a dismal failure . 	0
WD	12700	Allowing prayer in schools will improve , not detract from a student ' s understanding of the universe . 	0
WD	12701	It is hard to find out things that are good about co-ed schools and bad things about single sex schools 	0
WD	12702	That is why I am doing this , because of one of my classes . 	0
WD	12703	Single sex schools are not good because they do not give you the same oppertunity to us as a co-ed schools do . . . you shoulkd post some things for debate teams . 	1
WD	12704	I think sometimes we are just unrealistic . 	0
WD	12705	They can mainstream them in sports and electives for socialization . 	0
WD	12706	Guess what , they are ridiculed and picked on and continuie to act out cause they thin the other students are laughing " with them " . 	0
WD	12707	Also , sometimes ability and IQ are not the issue , social and bahavior are . 	0
WD	12708	If not , they need to be tracked in a class that tailors to thier needs . 	0
WD	12709	If a student can show in increased performance in a higher level mainstream class even with resource , great . 	0
WD	12710	Really , I think we need to actually offer individualized education . 	0
WD	12711	And I also see the government abuse for both sides of the spectrum . 	0
WD	12712	If you want you children to get a good education , private is the only way to do it ! 	1
WD	12713	That is up to government officials to start listening to the public and making the right changes . 	0
WD	12714	And no I don ' t feel guilty when I vote no on tax increases for their budget . 	0
WD	12715	The child would then be free to pursue other valuable activities such as art , playing etc . If done by parents with the right mindset , education levels and resources , I cannot see the problem . 	0
WD	12716	Although IDEA became law more than two decades ago , its implementation remains spotty . 	0
WD	12717	The government , teachers unions and political correctness has killed them . 	0
WD	12718	He points out that , â the World Court , for example , presumably the new fountain of justice , or a prototype of the socialist dream of world government , has no provision for â taking the name of God â â no oath . â 	0
WD	12719	I feel quite strongly that these students deserve education and mixing with others , but mainstream is not the way . 	1
WD	12720	Correction . . . worked hard and made sacrifices to afford PRIVATE school . 	0
WD	12721	The people who are demanding " Tolerance " are the biggest hypocrites of them all . 	0
WD	12722	All of this is avoided at most private schools . 	0
WD	12723	That is what is wrong . 	0
WD	12724	They have a Gay Straight Alliance club , but if someone were to form a Straight Straight Alliance club they would be demonized and labeled as " intolerant " which is complete BS . 	0
WD	12725	Final lesson ? 	0
WD	12726	You â ll always be judged for pretty much any parenting decision , so figure out what works best for your family and go with it . 	0
WD	12727	Benedikt â s argument stands on shaky legs and seems fueled solely by judgement ( which she admits ) rather than exploring actual , attainable solutions for improving the public school system . 	0
WD	12728	But , this seems par for the course when it comes to the â Mommy Wars â : Instead of focusing on real solutions and changes in harmful infrastructure , judgement is tossed about like it will bring magical results ( beyond anger and defensiveness ) in its wake . 	0
WD	12729	I have been advised to put my money in private schools , or else save it for attorneys later . 	0
WD	12730	Yes , there were some quite handsome ones that my eye would wander to in class , but not enough to distract me from my work , have me expelled for poor grades and end up a delinquent on the street . 	0
WD	12731	Once I switched schools , I found myself with valuable â and what I â m sure to be life long â friendships with the boys I sat with in class . 	0
WD	12732	The shock of all of a sudden being in a class with boys upon entering college must be just as scary as leaving home on the collegiate journey ! 	0
WD	12733	How can that be successfully done when you are singularly interacting with only girls in an educational environment ? 	0
WD	12734	I really felt if I had stayed , I would have been unprepared for life after high school , socially speaking . 	0
WD	12735	Well , smart child , smart decisions = successful in a co-ed school ! 	0
WD	12736	Isn â t that the fear of parents ? 	0
WD	12737	And look at that , not pregnant ! 	0
WD	12738	What struck me throughout her school years was her total confidence as she went through school . 	0
WD	12739	She always felt she could succeed and did . 	0
WD	12740	We always did a lot of reading and exploring the world we live in , so keeping her mind busy wasn ' t a problem . 	0
WD	12741	She is now a lawyer , who graduated in 2011 , president of the law school bar association , hired right out of school and doing very well . 	0

WD	12743	She turned 5 in early September , but our thought was emotionally , she wasn ' t ready , so she started at 6 . 	0

WD	12749	The only way my parents could have fixed it , as the author claims would have happened , is if they quit their jobs and taught themselves . 	0
WD	12750	On the other side Homechoolers , depending on where you live and possibly how you are homeschooled , have homeschooling groups which not only have a large group of people , though usually smaller thatn the public school , but have the freedom of doing things togethermore often , Time schedules are more flexible and if you really wanted to you could skip a whole day of school in the middle of the wek just to hand out eith people . 	0

WD	12753	Another point to be made is your peers , if your a introvert , than it doesn ' t really matter which school you go to on this point , If you are an extrovert then here are the facts : when public school was created , many people grasped it to recieve a free education and now it is a part of everyday life , at least it is in the United States , that means that there are a lot of poeple in public school and so it would be great for an extrovert . 	0

WD	12772	Our district schools are less than admirable . 	0
WD	12773	Having attended our district schools myself all throughout my childhood , it is clear that our district schools have issues . . . financially and educationally . 	0
WD	12774	I agree that if I sent my child to a public school I would do everything in my power to help make it a better place for all children but why would I subject my children to that experiment when I have the choice to send them to a private school where I can be involved in the school without having to help fix it ? 	0
WD	12775	I ' m not saying that private schools are worry-free or perfect by any means but our private school is a hell of a lot better than our local district schools . 	0

WD	12782	Forcing your religion on someone else is wrong and if your faith is not strong enough to withstand any of the statements above without you becoming frustrated or enraged , then maybe you should visit your local religious establishment and pray for open mindedness and patience . 	0

WD	12785	As mentioned in a study by Mael ( 1998 ) coeducation classrooms and schools reflect real life and prepare youths for gender interactions and society more so than a single-sex school would , it could also reduce sex stereotypes . 	0
WD	12786	There are MANY issues with how public education is formed , and the parents sending their kids to private school , are not going to make a difference . 	0
WD	12787	We all learned as young women the hard-to-measure notion that females can be leaders in any area just by looking around us at our peers . 	0
WD	12788	I have seen a few schools that if the form is not signed , they tell you that there school might not be right for you . 	0

WTP	13425	Multiple editors have altered it , mainly because the current format is considered misleading by many Catholics . 	0
WTP	13426	A second point is the first sentence of the article . 	0
WTP	13427	I would suggest something like : " The Roman Catholic Church , more officially termed the Catholic Church â¦ " 	1
WTP	13428	Assuming that the article title remains Roman Catholic Church , the first sentence still needs changing in order to be less misleading , and even offensive to some Catholics . 	1
WTP	13429	The problem here is that what has become the current construction implies ( wrongly ) that the official name of the Church is the Roman Catholic Church , and Catholic Church is an unofficial term . 	0
WTP	13430	The most recent edit has put : " The Catholic Church , often referred to by protestants as the Roman Catholic Church . . . " 	0

WTP	13433	If you want paragraphs about Sabbath at the beginning of an article , go to the Black Sabbath article . 	0
WTP	13434	This article is about heavy metal in general , and saying Sabbath is more important than Zeppelin and Deep Purple is utterly unverifiable . 	0
WTP	13435	What ' s more , anyone could easily shoot that argument down by pointing out that Zeppelin was doing it before Sabbath , and had even more commercial success . 	0

WTP	13441	Anyway , there ' s an alternate image of a pro-life gathering . 	0
WTP	13442	That said , my own personal concern for the pictures is the unintended Amerocentrism ; it would be nice to to have capture an image of activists in the abortion debate in another country . 	0

WTP	13445	After all , " size isn ' t everything , " and many gatherings are considerably smaller affairs than the March for Life or March for Women ' s Lives . 	0
WTP	13446	I don ' t think that the relevancy of an issue can be judged from the apparent turnout in a picture of an isolated protest . 	1
WTP	13447	Another user above expressed the concern that the younger age of the pro-life demonstrators in the photo makes the pro-choice cause appear less current . 	0
WTP	13448	I think the issue is one of scale : the pro-life demonstration is by Bound for Life , a grassroots organization , while the pro-choice image depicts activists at the March for Women ' s Lives . 	0
WTP	13449	Saying he " dictated " the Book of Mormon is a fairly neutral representation of what Smith did , and it takes no position on whether he was " translating " in a scientific sense , receiving text by revelation , or making it up as he went , all 3 of which are theoretically possible . 	1
WTP	13450	Highlighting one of those options or opinions , that it was " translated by the gift and power of God " , is not that important in the context of the sentence as a whole . 	0
WTP	13451	That claim can be and is covered elsewhere . 	0
WTP	13452	Plus it ' s just more wordy and doesn ' t flow as well as the original text . 	0
WTP	13453	I ' m having a very hard time seeing why the first would be preferable . 	1
WTP	13454	It seems to engage in subtle puffery , what with the " over 500 pages . . . in about 60 days " statement . 	0

WTP	13465	That will get the " magic number " for GA ; but it should probably only be done if someone also feels it will improve the article . 	0
WTP	13466	If something needs to be sacrificed at the Good Article altar , my suggestion is that we reduce the epidemiological information ( much of paragraph 3 ) to about a sentence , and combine it with paragraph 4 . 	1
WTP	13467	Specifically , those who assert that it is too long should state what information there is superfluous or in some way detracts from the goal of the lede being a readable overview . 	0
WTP	13468	Therefore any criticism of its length should be based on content rather than an arbitrary number . 	0
WTP	13469	What the lede needs to be is a concise , readable overview of the article . 	0

WTP	13474	The soft parts can be compared to the soft parts of an Opeth or Tool song ( both bands two prominent prog metal bands , heavily influenced by Sabbath and especially this album with its innovative heavy / soft approach ) , which , also , hold no blues influences . 	0
WTP	13475	They contain no blues influences at all , basically , and your already stated example is , as said , very poor . 	0
WTP	13476	The softer parts are soft ; neither the chord progressions , the song melodies , the guitar licks , or anything , contain any clear blues influences . 	0
WTP	13477	I wouldn ' t accept that sentence , among other reasons because Hamas is also fighting against the Israeli occupation of what we call Israel , which is not Palestinian land . 	1

WTP	13481	If we are to mention the sex scandals in the lead , my suggestion would be to also include a percentage of total priests accused . 	0
WTP	13482	It is very unfair to all of the faithful , hardworking and self-sacrificing priests out there who are suffering from this misconception and my heart really hurts for them . 	0
WTP	13483	The church response and reforms were not covered by the press hardly at all and I think the aricle serves the public interest by making that known . 	0
WTP	13484	Reasons why I think sex scandals should be mentioned in the lead : I think the article ' s section covering the sex abuse scandal is one of the most important ones because of the recent controversy and press coverage over it . 	1
WTP	13485	In the Archdiocese of Miami the number was 1% of all priests who had worked here since 1950 . 	0
WTP	13486	In my religious education class , I asked the students what percentage of priests they thought had been accused of sexual misconduct and I got answers ranging from 30-50% . 	0
WTP	13487	Catholics have been persecuted more often than they have persecuted - all of these events are notable and relevent to the history of the Church and have been mentioned and wikilinked in the article as such . 	0
WTP	13488	This is not POV , this is following Wikipedia guidelines . 	0
WTP	13489	We cant say that an article is POV just because many instances of persecutions of Catholics are mentioned in greater number than persecutions by Catholics . 	1
WTP	13490	The facts of history bear out the fact that is how it is . 	0
WTP	13491	We can ' t eliminate those facts from the article without violating FA rules that require us to make mention of notable events . 	0
WTP	13492	Just as the Inquisitions are mentioned and the facts relating to the persecution of heretics is provided , so we have given equal treatment to all other persecutions relevant to the Catholic Church . 	0
WTP	13493	I would like to elaborate further on how this article is NPOV . 	0
WTP	13494	The facts regarding the persecutions of Catholics in England , Ireland and Wales are relevant facts that speak directly about the Catholic Church - how it was banned in those areas and people who resisted were dealt with in a particular way - persecutions . 	0

WTP	13532	where ' s the controversy ? 	0
WTP	13533	And if we ' re talking about the Spanish Inquisition , and giving figures , then it is important to note that most of the Inquisition killings occurred in a twenty year period when the Inquisition was run by Torquemada and it was involved in the campaign against supposed false Moorish conversos under Ferdinand and Isabella . 	0
WTP	13534	Pope SIxtus condemned the Spanish Inquisitions procedures at this time , but was brow-beaten by Ferdinand into saying nothing more . 	0
WTP	13535	It could imply thst everyone tsken in by the inquisition was killed . 	0
WTP	13536	In fact the 3-4 , 000 figure is across the Spanish Empire , and over a period of 400 years . 	0
WTP	13537	As Kamen said , most local district courts in Europe executed far more people than the entire Spanish Inquisition over the period 1520 - 1820 . 	0

WTP	13666	My sentence , including the word terrorist would be as follows : " Hamas is a resistance organization that fights against Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands . 	0
WTP	13667	Well thanks for accepting that part of my position , but ID only answered half of the question asked . 	0
WTP	13668	I specifically said " a resistance organization fighting Israeli occupation " . 	0

WTP	13673	Strongly suggest you write an article about the sex scandals , if one doesn ' t exist . 	0
WTP	13674	Don ' t try to hide the facts of what they do . 	0
WTP	13675	Your last comment simply shows your POV , being a Hamas apologist . 	0
WTP	13676	Instead of choosing military targets , they target civilians , in order to terrorize the population to get what they want . 	0
WTP	13677	They choose to pursue their cause by murdering civilians , with no military use . 	0
WTP	13678	As I ' ve explained , their method of willful , intentional killing of civilians is the most salient and important detail about them . 	1
WTP	13679	I didn ' t say " Hamas is a terrorist organization " ( though it is ) , but that it employs clear-cut terrorist tactics , which is 100% true and accurate , and not open to interpretation . 	0
WTP	13680	My position is to NOT BELIEVE ANY OF THEM -U . S . , israel , Hamas , PLO , South Africa , Canada , etc . It ' s not a secret that politicians lie â¦ . . 	0
WTP	13681	are you really that naive , or do you have ulterior motives for trying to paint Hamas as a " terrorist organization " ? 	0
WTP	13682	There is also the [ CSICOP article ] , The book ' Pseudoscience in Biological Psychiatry : Blaming the body ' , reviewed in NEJM . 	0
WTP	13683	There is also a section in ' Anti-psychiatry ' named Psychiatry as a pseudo-science replete with its own sources . 	0
WTP	13684	I must have missed the part in your response where you refuted my legal connection between the governing bodies of the U . S . / israel / Hamas - They are all democratically elected ( by international standards ) governing bodies and are currently in states of war and are ALL committing legitimate and illegitimate actions , and therefore . 	0
WTP	13685	@ " Okedem " I ' m sorry . . . . 	0
WTP	13686	Therefore , I repeat again , can you tell me why it is fair , balanced and logical to include the " terrorist " comment on the " Hamas " wiki page ( in the initial description ) whereas it is apparently not on the " U . S . " and " israel " wiki page ? 	0
WTP	13687	should be treated equally . 	0
WTP	13688	( and please don ' t refer me to the comments made by U . S . and israeli politicians claiming that the FAR greater civilian deaths caused by their governments are " by accident " . . . . . . because we ' re not supposed to believe Hamas ' claims . . . . . but we ' re supposed to believe U . S . / israeli claims ? ? ? 	0
WTP	13689	Could you please explain your reasoning that logically leads you to make this claim ? 	0
WTP	13690	What ' s so misleading or scary about that ? 	0
WTP	13691	The first sentence of this section sounds awkward ( ask an editor who is not involved with WP and has no axe to grind about HIV ) and seems to bend over backwards to deny that anyone with any kind of biological credentials could possibly believe anything is missing from the current theory . 	0
WTP	13692	I agree , what happened to mentioning those three topics ? 	0
WTP	13693	And why are we still using the non-Catholic word " pro-life " ( consistent life ethic may work better ) . 	0

WTP	13696	That said , let me also say that I reviewed various WP guidelines as prodded . 	0
WTP	13697	Let me start by saying I made a mistake in regard to " researchers " . 	1
WTP	13698	I had assumed from the journal citation in this section that Papadopulos was an HIV researcher . 	0
WTP	13699	It simply summarizes various viewpoints , providing a lot of nuance about why some scientists suspect cofactors , why some HIV-positive people refused treatment and then got it , why some doctors no longer deny HIV ' s role but still think something ' s incomplete . 	0
WTP	13700	So , I don ' t see a problem with POZ as a source to * report opinions * , which is basically what the first part of this section is doing , is it not ? 	1
WTP	13701	Secondary sources are actually preferable ( to my surprise ) , mainly because of usability and ease of checking . 	0
WTP	13702	POZ does not claim to be a scientific article ! 	0
WTP	13703	NPA , Ec5618 . 	0
WTP	13704	That said , Ros , there is strong precedence against shock images on this article ( Archive 14 , " Link to ' Aborted Children ' " , Archive 16 , " Linking to Images is Allowed " , Archive 20 , " Abortion Images / Links " . 	1
WTP	13705	Such images , in the context of the politically-charged Abortion article , would be more argumentative than informative â a violation of WP : NPOV . 	0
WTP	13706	- 	0
WTP	13707	I did watch the National Geographic special , and had exactly that thought . 	0
WTP	13708	The researchers ' stronger case is argued from the other direction . 	1
WTP	13709	The Sea People are assumed to have had the most impact on the coasts . 	0
WTP	13710	The current coastal people are genetically highly similar to their inland neighbors . 	0
WTP	13711	This misses the point . 	0
WTP	13712	In order to determine that a given population ' s genetic pool lacks a significant contribution from some other given population , one needs to know first what characterizes the genes of that other population - - in this case , the " Sea People . " 	0
WTP	13713	This is what " Tomer " means by knowing who they were . 	0
WTP	13714	As the genetic character of the Sea People cannot be be determined , screening definitively for it seems impossible . 	1
WTP	13715	Therefore it is unlikely the coastal people interbred with any outsiders to a greater degree than the inland people did . 	0
WTP	13716	While stronger , that still isn ' t a lock . 	1
WTP	13717	The tag ( s ) seem to have been removed ( probably correctly ) because the reasons for adding the tag are no applicable to the tag , or are unarticulated ( or poorly articulated ) or discussed and removed - much like many other articles in WP in fact . 	0
WTP	13718	Just because people disagree with the article doesn ' t mean it needs a tag . 	0
WTP	13719	At one time the point was to put priests on par with doctors , lawyers , etc . I ' ve been told that it has been loosened up in various dioceses , states , countries , etc . Some seminaries in the midwest are even non-accredited . 	0

WTP	13722	When I was in Seminary . . . it was 4 years of college seminary and 2-3 years post-graduate . 	0
WTP	13723	Anyway , it isn ' t on-topic here and would be better suited to inclusion at Domestic rabbit if anywhere . 	1
WTP	13724	I agree . 	0

WTP	13735	Broader there are studies that show that antidepressants have only limited benefit over placebo [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] . 	0
WTP	13736	Indeed there was a broad consensus , but to be more precise , it was to make the title NPOV and to bring it into harmony with the existing inclusion criteria and existing contents . 	0
WTP	13737	The title was the only problem . 	0

WTP	13748	It would be much better to find a good , NPOV to portray the controversies ( such as the single sentence that mentions all of the issues that I think Nancy quoted above ) rather than wait for the masses to put in heaven-only-knows-what nonsense . 	1
WTP	13749	The child abuse scandals , or the RCC ' s positions on homosexuality , abortions , and euthanasia , are controversies that are well known outside of the RCC . 	0
WTP	13750	The child abuse scandals are also not strictly a US issue , although the article does not do a good job of pointing that out . 	0
WTP	13751	Summorum Pontificum is a controversy that is relatively confined to the Church faithful - few people outside of the RCC have heard of it or would really consider it a controversy . 	0
WTP	13752	By all means mention it in the lead if you choose , but I believe the more recent controversies need a single line in the lead as well . 	1

WTP	13816	It isn ' t vandalism , and I can ' t argue with the validity of the changes , but they do lengthen the article and some of the material is a little too detailed IMO . 	0
WTP	13817	Rarranging the article without consultation is also problematic in that it is being groomed for FA submission . 	1

WTP	13825	" Legendary " and " historical " do not show that Santa is a fable , a myth . 	1
WTP	13826	While we cannot ignore the historical underpinnings of the character , we cannot - with respect to those who believe wholeheartedly in the Flying Fat Man - escape that the wacky stories and abilities attributed to the fellow are beyond those of mortal men . 	0
WTP	13827	Much like the aforementioned example of the Easter Bunny , Santa is a mythical character . 	1
WTP	13828	However , the greater part of the character is fantastical , with enough powers and abilities to make Superman envious . 	0
WTP	13829	1 Santa has a roughly factual grounding with some embellishment , like Abe Lincoln or Johnny Appleseed ; this makes the character legendary . 	0
WTP	13830	An endorsement of LDS theology like this is not acceptable under the WP : NPOV rule . 	0
WTP	13831	In addition , whether or not the AAF is a reliable source is not the question--the issue is whether or a link to their website is a reliable source . 	0
WTP	13832	I am guessing no one is up for that . 	0
WTP	13833	Therefore , I think that mythological is the best we are going to get , when the clear alternative would be to scientifically dismiss the character as an indigestion-inspired hallucination ( " more gravy than grave to it " , to paraphrase Scrooge ) . 	0
WTP	13834	As to citing the LDS website , such citations are generally only appropriate in order to document official LDS positions or perspectives . 	0
WTP	13835	To show the " truth " of something , it is more problemmatic , and you would want to cite something that has been peer reviewed . 	0
WTP	13836	I don ' t think it is , because we know nothing about the editorial process and any peer review other than the fact that the web page was " compiled by [ unnamed ] AAF editors " . 	1
WTP	13837	If the AAF publishes in a peer reviewed journal , then we would want to cite that journal . 	0
WTP	13838	I am not claiming that it * is * pseudoscience , what I am stating is the fact that it has been characterized as being unfalsifiable , if you do not believe that this then constitutes similitude with pseudoscience I suggest you go rewriting [ Falsifiability ] and [ scientific method ] then come back here . 	1

WTP	13916	This page has 2 split off pages for his foreign policy , hence when splitting the page one must sumarise the info here . 	0
WTP	13917	I thus left an uncontroversial edit here and moved the controversy to the other pages . 	0
WTP	13918	( as someone else said above ) Also the lead was bigger than the section on foreign policy so i moved the stuff below to the section ( which is not a decent sized 2-3 para section ) . 	0
WTP	13919	No content was removed , and nothing controversial was inserted so i i dont think there should bea fight / edit war . 	1

WTP	13935	She ran away with a Muslim sheikh , converted to Islam . 	0
WTP	13936	In the days before the creation of Israel ( and the mass emigration of sephardic Jews from Islamic Arab countries to Israel ) it was not that unusual for a Sephardic Jewish woman to marry a Muslim man , and in fact , a Jewish ( or Christian ) woman would not be required to convert to Islam to marry a Muslim man under Islamic law ( though a Muslim woman many only marry a Muslim though she may marry a Muslim convert and a woman from another religion not considered a " people of the book " like Jews or Christians would have to convert before Islamic law will recognize the marriage ) . 	1
WTP	13937	Given the other account , that his mother converted to Islam at 9 years old , it may not be clear if his mother was from the grandmother ' s first marriage to the Jewish man or from the second marriage to the sheikh . 	0
WTP	13938	Apparently , according to the Israeli media , under Jewish halachic law , to be a Jew one must be born to a Jewish mother or convert to Judaism . 	1
WTP	13939	You are reading " psychoanalysis should not be generally characterized as pseudoscience " , which is in the text you cited . 	0
WTP	13940	If so , Gaddafi would meet the legal Islamic definition of being a Muslim , while also meeting the legal , Jewish , definition of being a Jew . 	1
WTP	13941	If born to a Jewish mother , you qualify as a Jew and at least some authorities maintain it does not matter if your mother--born Jewish--aposticizes and joins another religion . 	0

WTP	13943	This article looks to me , a layman who has indirectly encountered research as a freelance editor , like a very detailed biological article that explains everything one would want to know about a virus . 	1
WTP	13944	It necessarily addresses consequences of infection , and it necessarily addresses secondary effects ( e . g . , loss of income , loss of parents ) , though I feel the latter should not be part of the lead . 	0

WTP	13958	When does the nationality of a performer ever create a genre ? 	0
WTP	13959	Here ' s a practical example ; The sub-genre of Thrash Metal breaks out mid-80s , a mostly American phenomenon . 	0
WTP	13960	Yes there are others and I ' m aware of them but can you sit here and enumerate tons of bands described as Funk Metal ? 	0
WTP	13961	Even then , most of these bands fit into the Alternative Metal category as well , maybe even more so . EDIT : Also , there ' s an argument about breaking racial boundaires ? 	0
WTP	13962	Shortly after , a similar style emerges in Germany with common traits that differentiate it from its American counterparts . 	0

WTP	13967	It also needs to be stated at the beginning that the Church terms itself the " Catholic Church " See for example : http://www.catholicchurch.org.uk/ 	1
WTP	13968	The point is that the Anglican Church does not officially term itself the Catholic Church and neither does the Orthodox Church , while the ( roman ) Catholic Church does do just that , and has done so from earliest times . 	0
WTP	13969	The term Roman Catholic Church is largely a construct of the reformation period , when other groups wanted to claim " catholicism " . 	0
WTP	13970	The " Old Catholic Church " is known as just that - although it is not very old . 	0
WTP	13971	While " Roman Catholic Church " may be acceptable for an article title to avoid confusion . 	0
WTP	13972	I see the Germans have a statue at the top of their entry ( perhaps understandable in their case ) . 	0
WTP	13973	There is no demarcation between pseudoscience so while you can clearly distinguish between physics and cryptozoology , you will still have have boundary issues . 	0

WTP	13999	Purple ' s dismissal of blues is clear , but blues is still ever-present in every album , and they don ' t take a clear step away from it like Sabbath does in " Sabbath Bloody Sabbath " . 	0
WTP	14000	The other songs are a little more similar in heaviness , but it ' s important acknowledging that Paranoid is relatively light in Sabbath ' s music , while Highway Star is particularly heavy in Purple ' s . 	0
WTP	14001	" Burn " came later , and is kind of metal , but made when the genre already was established by Sabbath . 	0
WTP	14002	" Sweet Leaf " is groundbreaking in a groundbreaking album ; notice the riffing in between the verses , and the riffs after the guitar solo ; they are but a taste of what is a norm in metal music from then on ; the breaking of common scales , and heavy usage of alternative intervals , like semitones and the tritone . 	0

WTP	14008	In Hungary , yes , but even Khanty and Mansi lie within Europe . 	0

WTP	14092	That would be more correct really and is not POV since there are no other churches that call itself the Catholic Church . 	0

WTP	14098	You are being patient and nice , and I appreciate that . 	0
WTP	14099	You directed me to a section of the NPOV policy dealing with undue weight , which exactly clarifies the point that I am making : " An article should not give undue weight to any aspects of the subject , but should strive to treat each aspect with a weight appropriate to its significance to the subject . 	0
WTP	14100	Our argument is about what constitutes a notable controversy in a WP article on the Roman Catholic Church , and my position is that the sex abuse scandals don ' t make the cut because so many other controversies in the church are so much more notable . 	1
WTP	14101	Given the 2000 year history of the church , and all the things associated with the church , I ' d say even a mention of the sex abuse scandals in the lead is undue weight , based on prominence of placement . 	1
WTP	14102	Note that undue weight can be given in several ways , including , but not limited to , depth of detail , quantity of text , prominence of placement , and juxtaposition of statements " ( emphasis added ) . 	0
WTP	14103	If the lead needs to include a contemporary controversy ( and it is not clear to me that it does ) , I understand mentioning the the sex abuse scandal , although I think that it is much more significant to the Roman Catholic Church , and much more encyclopedia-worthy , to include the debates around the implementation of Summorum Pontificum . 	0
WTP	14104	Like I said before , if it ' s necessary for FA , I ' m not going to stand in the way , but it looks to me like it violates several WP policies . 	0

WTP	14156	One thing to consider is that Joseph Smith declares that the dispensation that he proclaims is a restoration of the Truth , and for everyone else - - " all their creeds were an abomination in his sight ; that those professors were all corrupt " . 	0
WTP	14157	Either way , he said the word ' sect ' and so unless you have some clear evidence that it didn ' t mean sect , then it should say ' sect ' . 	1
WTP	14158	We can assume he knows no distinction and just switches terms constantly , or we can assume he deliberately chooses the terms . 	0
WTP	14159	So , Smith uses a lot of different terms back and forth . 	0
WTP	14160	In the lines leading up to the passage where Smith describes his experience in the official Joseph Smith-History from LDS , Smith uses various words to describe religion and religious things . 	0

" 	0
WTP	14169	Considering that the case was defended by the then Attorney General of Ireland Aindrias Ã Caoimh one could reasonably expect the facts to be as viewed by the state itself . 	1
WTP	14170	Perhaps using that phrase would be preferable to any UK word use and you even have a decent reference to substantiate it and those are lawyers speaking . 	1
WTP	14171	I think it ' s important to recognize though that this is an area where potentially we might have compromised and - and arrived at a bill that dealt with the narrow concerns about how a - a previable fetus or child was treated by a hospital . 	0
WTP	14172	I recognize this is a passionate issue , and so I - I won ' t , as I said , belabor the point . 	0
WTP	14173	And if we ' re placing a burden on the doctor that says you have to keep alive even a previable child as long as possible and give them as much medical attention as - as is necessary to try to keep that child alive , then we ' re probably crossing the line in terms of unconstitutionality . 	0
WTP	14174	Viability is the line that has been drawn by the Supreme Court to determine whether or not an abortion can or cannot take place . 	0
WTP	14175	The second reason that it would probably be found unconstitutional is that this essentially says that a doctor is required to provide treatment to a previable child , or fetus , however way you want to describe it . 	0
WTP	14176	For that purpose , I think it would probably be found unconstitutional . 	0
WTP	14177	It was . 	0
WTP	14178	I suggested to Members of the Judiciary Committee that it was unconstitutional and it would be struck down by the Seventh Circuit . 	0

WTP	14555	Now , logical assessment will lead you to conclude that this is just semantics and that countries committing the same acts as " terrorists " would also fall into the category of " terrorism " . . . . . . . . it ' s just that the U .

WTP	14557	Your next point : " Their designation had nothing to do with elections status . . . . . . . should not change due to the elections " Actually , if you check the U .

WTP	14625	So to recap , it seems like you need to explain how you ' re not running against WP : EL # ADV and WP : ELNO ' s # 4 , 10 , and 11 ; if you can ' t get any editors who regularly use Wikipedia to comment in your favour here , perhaps you should seek redress via Wikipedia : Third opinion as your last resort in getting this put to bed . 	0

WTP	14658	Indeed , I could complain about some parts of the article as it is , The section on the Reformation contains some highly critical comments : The most famous scholar of the age , Erasmus , in 1509 wrote In Praise of Folly which captured a widely held opinion about corruption in the church . [ 189 ] Abuses of power , usury , clerical wealth and hypocrisy all contributed to a general feeling among educated people that reform of some sort was necessary . [ 189 ] In 1517 , Martin Luther included his Ninety-Five Theses in a letter to several bishops , hoping to spark debate . [ 190 ] His theses protested key points of Catholic doctrine as well as the sale of indulgences . [ 190 ] Huldrych Zwingli , John Calvin , and others further criticized Catholic teachings . 	1
WTP	14659	These challenges developed into the Protestant Reformation . 	0
WTP	14660	I could object to some of this , Martin Luther inttended to spark more than debate when he posted his theses . 	0
WTP	14661	and there are none of the many negatives about him here ( anti-semitism , allowing bigamy , coercion , sanctining slaying of the peasants ) . 	0

WTP	14699	In regards to the back and forth here , I think the reasons for hesitation on inclusions of these types of things are legit , and Scjessey ' s response ( while it does look POVish ) is based on the fact that there were editors here wanting to included everything negative pushed at Obama during the first months of his presidency . 	1

WTP	14783	I ' d also like to note that there obviously was hard rock before there was heavy metal ( though I ' m not absolute on whether or not Cream , Hendrix , and certain Kinks songs were considered such at the time ) , and early metal and hard rock / heavy metal acts were influenced by it . 	1

WTP	14800	Perhaps something from earlier history - even very ancient history , would be more appropriate , avoiding the problems of politics , over-attention to recent history ( there are three images related to recent wars involving America , any more than one is too many ) and preferably not so gruesome . 	0
WTP	14801	The image we had before , and I reverted the addition of this image once already , was Peter Fechter dying on the Berlin Wall , though that ' s from a period after the war had ended , so I ' d rather not use that as the ' final ' image for the section . 	1
WTP	14802	Would an image of a US marine shot dead in Iraq be considered equally appropriate for the article ? 	0
WTP	14803	Also think about this from a political view - Chinese people may be highly offended by the image . 	0
WTP	14804	It seems a little over the top - Wikipedia is not censored , but do we need to use such a gruesome image to prove a point ? 	0
WTP	14805	I tend to agree that this image is fairly disturbing - the body is partly decapitated and there are flies all over the head and torso . 	1
WTP	14806	While I understand the incident is being investigated , it is hard to believe that not even a small blurb about a pending domestic abuse incident involving Rihanna is not included in this article . 	0

WTP	14808	I honestly don ' t understand why we keep talking about CCHR / Scientology , it is simply not needed in order to put biopsychiatry on the list per the current criteria . 	1

WTP	14841	Both Britannica and the Encarta articles on the Church do a better job of addressing the abuse scandal in the life of the Church . 	0
WTP	14842	The article as it is written states that the abuse is a recent U . S . anomaly while plenty of serious books written from both within the Church and without give another view . 	0
WTP	14843	That other view must be in this article for it to be NPOV . 	0

WTP	14845	I would not put Cartman ' s mom in the same class of characters as SKCK , even though she has often had as much screen-time as any one of thm and is sometimes central to the plot . 	0
WTP	14846	The show has a large supporting cast of characters some of whom become more or less prominent depending on the episode - and we can through in the eight parents , and Ike , while we are at it . 	0
WTP	14847	South prk revolves around the relationshps among Stan , Kyle , Cartman and Kenny , sometimes through their separate adventures . 	0
WTP	14848	The effec is identical - so who do you think you are fooling ( except possibly yourself ) when you protest that " main " does not appear ? 	0
WTP	14849	When you removed " main " from Butters , you removed it for the other four . 	0
WTP	14850	When these characters were identified as main , you added " main " to Butters . 	0
WTP	14851	The issue is not whether or not Butters is identifid as a " main " character , the question is whether Butters is given the sam prominence as Stan , Kyle , Cartman , and Kenny . 	0
WTP	14852	MarnetteD , removing the word " main " does not resolve the question . 	1

WTP	14859	It just seems to stupid to censor content that speaks no message other then " This is an abortion . " . 	1
WTP	14860	I found " Zionist Regime " and other descriptions instead . 	0
WTP	14861	I might as well address this point now : as I had said above the pictures of abortion are pretty NPOV to begin with . 	0
WTP	14862	Pictures displayed matter-of-factly that somehow evoke pity or sympathy do not mean that they can ' t ever be displayed without sharing a point ; they just draw upon innate emotions . 	0
WTP	14863	As was said above I realize this is already a touched upon issue and my comment is nothing new to the argument but I was wondering why is there no actual picture of an abortion / post aborted fetus on this page ? 	0
WTP	14864	The picture is only as POV as the messages following it as I ' ve seen many proponents of abortion openly share them and declare they are worthless appeal to emotion in the context of abortion debate . 	1
WTP	14865	Regardless , they ' re neutral outside debate and it ' s curious an entire article on ABORTION has no picture of such despite the fact they clearly exist . 	0

WTP	14871	As it happens there are items on this list that use Randi as a source , I have not really heard about the guy before today but his website doesn ' t exactly exude credibility . 	0
WTP	14872	It is still a discussion that is worth having sooner rather than later . . 	0
WTP	14873	As an aside , I seriously hope that we do not include scientology as sources regarding psychiatry , there is simply no need and it detracts from the case made by ' actual scientists and medical professionals ' . 	0
WTP	14874	Aliens in DC-10s notwithstanding , scientology have made themselves notable when they have the likes of Tom Cruise decrying psychiatry on prime-time tv . 	0
WTP	14875	This would defuse the oncoming impasse and allow readers to judge for themselves if they consider the sources authoritative . 	0
WTP	14876	I think we should consider properly attributing claims to their sources in-text . 	1
WTP	14877	As I mentioned above , there is no visible context in the picture showing that it has anything to do with either the West Bank or the Gaza Strip . 	0
WTP	14878	Thank you for returning to the talk page before editing . 	0
WTP	14879	It could have been taken in Nablus , East Jerusalem or Petach Tikvah . 	0
WTP	14880	It is a picture of four men , two in uniform , holding rifles . 	0
WTP	14881	As such it is an excellent illustrative photo of militantism in Israeli culture or the citizen-soldier nature of the IDF but not relevant to a general article about the IDF or an article about a specific location . 	1
WTP	14882	We should consider moving the first paragraph of this section elsewhere , as well as renaming it , since the other sources are quite low-quality and the entire bit is rather crystal ball-ish . 	0

WTP	14884	I ' d like to question the latter edit of changing " cessation " into " permanent end " . 	0

WTP	14890	The Prophet , Allah bless him and grant him salvation , has said : The Day of Judgement will not come about until Moslems fight the Jews ( killing the Jews ) , when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees . 	0
WTP	14891	The stones and trees will say O Moslems , O Abdulla , there is a Jew behind me , come and kill him . 	0
WTP	14892	Only the Gharkad tree , ( evidently a certain kind of tree ) would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews . 	0
WTP	14893	That said , I still fail to see what you ' re positing as the source of diversity . 	0
WTP	14894	Let ' s assume we mean ' speciation ' when we talk about ' diversity ' . 	0
WTP	14895	Anyway , that ' s obviously a semantic argument that ' s not worth having . 	0
WTP	14896	Drift and selection in that context act AGAINST the existing diversity , produced by mutations , and can only result in eventual fixation - that is , the elimination of variation . 	0
WTP	14897	If you just mean ' variation ' , e . g . the diversity evident within the human population , then you are wrong . 	1
WTP	14898	Also , I ' m unclear on how you ' re using ' diversity ' - if you mean strictly speciation , then I ' ll agree that drift and selection are important forces that are required to produce speciation , since one couldn ' t have fixation / divergence without them by definition . 	1
WTP	14899	I ' m unclear on what you mean . 	0
WTP	14900	I suppose I am confused , then - could you specify what these different lines of evidence are , one supporting common descent and the other supporting biodiversity ? 	0
WTP	14901	I agree that we don ' t need more discussion about editors themselves . 	0
WTP	14902	Let ' s all stick to the topic at hand . 	0
WTP	14903	Could you clarify ? 	0
WTP	14904	Yes ? 	0
WTP	14905	If you can ' t handle that , then you are under no obligation to contribute to this discussion . 	0

WTP	14919	I get that you " don ' t get it " but this is one event , THE FIRST VISION , was the event that true or false , was the basis for everything else that Smith did . 	0
WTP	14920	The redirect should be deleted and the word regime used in the lead with the correct wikilink . 	1
WTP	14921	I then entered " zionist regime " and it redirected to " zionist entity " ! 	0
WTP	14922	Not knowing exactly what a " zionist entity " was I went to the page . 	0
WTP	14923	The redirect is likely POV pushing and quite possibly it led to the use of entity in the lead being overlooked . 	0

WTP	15023	Furthermore , some of the groups referred to by a single name in our records were composed of people of very diverse background . 	0

WTP	15045	However , this is essentially what defines a pseudoscience . 	0

WTP	15130	If we included even a small paragraph for every controversy of a similar scope to the recent soldiers ' testimonies , we ' d easily get a 100K section only for criticism , because there were a series of such testimonies after each major operation , and some of the notable cases are listed here . 	1

WTP	15135	Mostly my sense of bemused irritation comes from folks who want to portray all natural , surgical , and pharmaceutical procedures similarly . 	0
WTP	15136	I can agree with that ( while also noting that the most widely used form of induced fertilized egg / blastocyst / fetus rejections are pharmaceutical , not surgical , in nature ) , but could that mean that the article is lopsided , or how we use pictures in the article is lopsided , or what ? 	0
WTP	15137	Ronabop , I think it ' s clear that most of the article is about induced abortion , as is most of the debate over the issue . 	0
WTP	15138	While seeing such things doesn ' t really bother me all that much ( having fed a good 20-30 fetuses to coyotes in my life , and consuming at least a few hundred . . . life on a farm an all ) , I ' m divided on how to present the subject , images , and article , properly in a NPOV manner . 	0
WTP	15139	However , I can understand their motivations , in that they are wishing to " humanize " and " personalize " , abortion , and one of the more functional tactics in that effort has been using shock images . 	0
WTP	15140	To repeat a refrain , many who have asked for ( and suggested ) pictures are * not * asking for pictures of an abortion procedure , or process , they are asking for gore pictures of a dead human fetus , which is not what this article is about , subject-wise ( Though it could be , if the article was renamed Human aborted fetuses ) . 	0

WTP	15163	Putting this in the lead will just cause more vandalism to the article than there is now ( which is already substantial ) . 	0

WTP	15166	Very little is said about Henry ' s persecutions - or what happened in Ireland Vague criticism . 	0
WTP	15167	Just as America points to a broader page , rather then the USA , and just like Orthodox Church points to something broader than the Eastern Orthodox Church , so too Catholic Church should follow this precedent . 	0
WTP	15168	Until you all back up your personal interpretation with Wikipedia precedence as I have , your argument has no weight . 	0

WTP	15206	By the way , the fact that it ' s obvious to everyone that this material exists to " debunk the creationist " 2nd law " claim " is why I think it should be moved to the section on creation vs . evolution . 	1

WTP	15301	It ignores the credibility of the arguments in favor of putting in a matching number . 	0
WTP	15302	I think we ' re running into the same thing we run into on all political Wikipedia articles . 	1
WTP	15303	The argument consistently is " well , this guy has all this criticism , so why doesn ' t this guy get equal amount ? " 	0
WTP	15304	The problem is , that ' s not how balance works . 	1
WTP	15305	You don ' t balance out articles by putting the same amount of criticism in one because this much is in the other , anymore than you determine how many characters , pictures or quotes appear in each article . 	0

WTP	15322	" Number one , whenever we define a previable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or the other elements in the Constitution , what we ' re really saying is , in fact , that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a - a child , a nine-month-old - - child that was delivered to term . 	0
WTP	15323	Unfortunately , this bill goes a little bit further , and so I just want to suggest , not that I think it ' ll make too much difference with respect to how we vote , that this is probably not going to survive constitutional scrutiny . " 	0
WTP	15324	And there was some suggestion that we might be able to craft something that might meet constitutional muster with respect to caring for fetuses or children who were delivered in this fashion . 	0
WTP	15325	" Well , it turned out - that during the testimony a number of members who are typically in favor of a woman ' s right to choose an abortion were actually sympathetic to some of the concerns that your - you raised and that were raised by witnesses in the testimony . 	0
WTP	15326	Is that correct ? " 	0
WTP	15327	And one of the concerns that came out in the testimony was the fact that they were not being properly cared for during that brief period of time that they were still living . 	0
WTP	15328	According to the IL Senate transcripts , which links I just included , Obama ' s reasons for opposing the bills can be seen as follows , from his words posted verbatim : " Senator O ' Malley , the testimony during the committee indicated that one of the key concerns was - is that there was a method of abortion , an induced abortion , where the - - the fetus or child , as - as some might describe it , is still temporarily alive outside the womb . 	0
WTP	15329	As for # 1 , if you mean Obama was opposing the bills on state ' s rights , then you ' re wrong , and I ' m not sure where you are getting your sources . 	1
WTP	15330	I mean , it - it would essentially bar abortions , because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child , then this would be an antiabortion statute . 	0
WTP	15331	That determination then , essentially , if it was accepted by a court , would forbid abortions to take place . 	0
WTP	15332	Basically , Pop is her main genre . 	1

WTP	15340	RG , you state certainties , except when you say that Zeppelin are without a doubt a metal band . 	1
WTP	15341	They have one foot in the hard rock genre , and the other in the blues genre , together with the influences you mention , and I would hesitantly include heavy metal among those influences , because none of their albums are actual heavy metal ; they don ' t have it as an overhanging concept , but they do have heavy metal-ish ( I ' d say hard rock ) songs in their albums , like " Whole Lotta Love " and " Immigrant Song " . 	0
WTP	15342	And no , that ' s not slander . 	1
WTP	15343	If that ' s unfair it is because the situation is unfair , not because we ' re covering it with a different weight than the sources . 	0

WTP	15486	Therefore , to say that the research was confirmed , is rather incorrect . 	1
WTP	15487	Yes , HIV can be made by the " bucketful " . 	1
WTP	15488	Reverse transcriptase activity is shown to occur , and so it is assumed that the DNA that is found must be viral . 	1

WTP	15490	You cant cherry pick to get the translation to match your POV . 	0
WTP	15491	Nothing needs to change . 	1
WTP	15492	It has been strenuously argued that as Ahmadinejad ' s own website translated the speech as " wiped of the map " that that is the term that should be used here , despite RS ' s translating it correctly as " eliminated from the pages of history " , similarly Ahmadinejad ' s website also says " the regime occupying Jerusalem " . 	0
WTP	15493	You rejected the RS to support wiped off the map because his own website says that but you then object to using occupying regime because you want to use Zionist regime . 	0
WTP	15494	To compound this you keep trying to link it to Zionist entity . 	0
WTP	15495	So , encyclopedia articles aside , that three newspaper articles and one television interview is extensive ? 	0

WTP	15506	To use entity is very POV . 	1
WTP	15507	You want to use " wiped of the map " because that was how Ahmadinejad ' s own people translated it yet you seem to be rejecting the same standard for " Zionist regime " . 	0
WTP	15508	Regime does not carry the same pejorative meaning and means a government not a state ( it is clear from any translation that Ahmadinejad meant government ) so clearly they can not be interchangeable . 	1
WTP	15509	Firstly , the wiki page says using entity is " a pejorative for the State of Israel " . 	0
WTP	15510	A search finds 63 , 000 results for entity being used in a translation of the speech ( mostly op-eds and blogs with a few conservative newspapers ) and 357 , 000 results for " Zionist Regime " being used in a translation of the speech ( a large number of mainstream media including Haaretz , CNN , Washington Post , NYT and BBC etc ) . 	0
WTP	15511	Secondly , entity is not even close to the most widespread translation and the first time I have ever heard the word entity used for Israel was this article . 	0

WTP	15518	Just merging the Topics text up to the lead and promoting its subheadings would also work , as I am not sure what heading would be appropriate ; and Idiosyncratic ideas should probably be sorted and merged up , anyway . 	0

WTP	15527	It apposes the sexual act between somebody of the same sex but also says . . . 2358 The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible . 	0
WTP	15528	Also on the topic of homosexuality , this is the official , from the Catechism stance of the Church . 	0
WTP	15529	They must be accepted with respect , compassion , and sensitivity . 	0
WTP	15530	They do not choose their homosexual condition ; for most of them it is a trial . 	0
WTP	15531	These persons are called to fulfill God ' s will in their lives and , if they are Christians , to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord ' s Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition . 	0
WTP	15532	Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided . 	1
WTP	15533	Of course they take their view of Catholicism from a sensationalistic press rather than going to the source which says a homosexual must be treated with respect , compassion and sensitivity , also unjust disrcimination against them is wrong . 	0
WTP	15534	If the athiests who keep coming to rewrite the article with POV don ' t actually read things like the Catechism then we can never hope for a real NPOV . 	0

WTP	15536	For example , Wikipedia mentions notable criticisms of Barack Obama , but none are mentioned on the main page because of how strongly the editors there fight it . 	0
WTP	15537	I would think consensus alone should not be enough to block mention of topics that are notable and reliably sourced . 	0
WTP	15538	I have found in the past that no matter how notable a criticism of Obama , or how well-sourced it may be , that the editors on the Obama page will fight it tooth and nail , bringing in other liberal editors from elsewhere on Wikipedia and then claiming ' consensus ' regardless of past editors who provided opposite consensus who just aren ' t present at the time . 	1

WTP	15542	Furthermore , there is no denying the notability or relevance thereof , given that each of these issues , even apart from their mention on separate Wikipedia articles , has substantial independent media references . 	1
WTP	15543	Supposedly , though worthy of mention elsewhere on Wikipedia , they are somehow not valid on the page of the person they most concern . 	0
WTP	15544	As to confusing , while BP is , as you say , the operator of the well , Transocean is the operator of the rig and Transocean is the driller of the well ; it technically isn ' t an operating well until the drilling rig sails off and a production rig comes in . 	0
WTP	15545	BP is the client , but Transocean is the captain of the ship ( rig / platform ) . 	0
WTP	15546	The Macondo Prospect isn ' t a well , it ' s an oil field . 	0
WTP	15547	What blew up was something drilled for the prior couple months by Transocean ( allegedly faultily , with pieces of their BOP annulus breaking and coming up the riser pipe in chunks , indicating it was not in a condition to prevent a blowout ) and the casing sealed early that morning by Halliburton ( allegedly shoddily ; cementing problems are associated with 18 of 39 blowouts in the previous 15 years ; Halliburton admitted faulty cementing before the Montara oil spill in Australia last year ) . 	0
WTP	15548	The Deepwater Horizon is a drilling rig , known at Wikipedia as an oil platform . 	0
WTP	15549	It isn ' t BP ' s rig / platform , it is Transocean ' s rig / platform . 	0
WTP	15550	For someone complaining about piping links , you don ' t check them . 	1
WTP	15551	There is no Wikipedia article called oil rig . 	0
WTP	15552	And , while BP was 65% owner of the field , and so of the oil gushing from that field , the hearings that have been held have raked Transocean and Halliburton over the coals , and the investigations are looking into their actions , inactions and histories as much as BP ' s . 	0
WTP	15553	If the media and the public fails to grasp that , the public record of those official hearings is not irrelevant or subordinate ( or even equal ) to that . 	0

WTP	15564	Why don ' t you just let the facts be told , and let people make up their own minds as to what conclusions to make . 	0
WTP	15565	If your answer is no , then please do not hinder me ( or anyone else ) from contributing legitimate facts of truth to balance the obvious bias that is trying to be imposed on a legally elected governing body in order to shift readers to a specific viewpoint . 	0
WTP	15566	if your answer is yes , I await your edit to the page ( as I see you have done much editing to it , and will leave it to you ) and will not argue about having this information described in the first paragraph of the " Hamas " page . 	0
WTP	15567	For example , would you agree that in the first paragraph of the " israel " wiki page , it would state that the majority of the Palestinian population and millions of other people around the world regard israel as one of the biggest terrorist states ? ? 	0
WTP	15568	No one here is opposing the idea of including the ( false ) labels that people want to attribute to Hamas , we are just asking for the same treatment as is given to other governing bodies on wikipedia . 	1
WTP	15569	Before they were elected , maybe it would have seemed logical to include this type of view in the first paragraph , but not now , since the main subject surrounding the group ( for the people it represents i . e . the Palestinians ) pertains to it ' s legal standing as a minority government . 	0
WTP	15570	Thank you for moving my comment . . . . . as for the discussion , if you agree that the wiki page for " United States " should state in the first paragraph that it is considered by millions of people around the world as the biggest terrorist state , then I see no problem in doing this with Hamas ' wiki page . 	0

WTP	15575	Many Good and Featured Articles on Wikipedia have proven that , including Jolie ' s article , as they are not tabloid journalism or about " detailing every forgettable factor of the lives of celebrities . " 	0
WTP	15576	And I maintain that Personal life sections are not trivial within the scope of an individual ' s career and that Personal life sections are not that different from Early life sections . 	0
WTP	15577	Yours obviously differs . 	0
WTP	15578	But that ' s my stance . 	0
WTP	15579	Rihanna " allegedly " getting beat up by Chris Brown is not trivial either , seeing as it directly intertwined with her career ( as in cancelling an appearance and bruising her face / body , which are essential to her career ) . 	1

WTP	15950	Are we , on the other hand , discussing medical diagrams ? 	0
WTP	15951	There is , in fact , a photograph of the body of a woman who died of an illegal abortion which is occasionally trotted out in pro-choice literature , so it ' s not as though we ' re only discussing the exclusion of the aborted fetus pictures used in pro-life activism â the rule works both ways . 	0
WTP	15952	Also , photographs of an abortion procedure , as described by Ackoz , would be so ambiguous as to be suggestive of almost any other gynecological procedure . 	0

WTP	15963	IMO , this is not an appropriate place to make cursory mention of fields and theories because they once were referred to as pseudoscience by somebody , and not a place to do a quaint historical analysis of instances where , say , theories that were at some point in time alleged by somebody to be pseudoscientific turned out later to have merit after scientific method came to be fully applied to those theories . 	1

WTP	16163	A brief scan through parts of the article reveals some dubious points : In 1521 , the first Catholics were baptized in what would become the first Christian nation in Southeast Asia , the Philippines . [ 171 ] The following year , Franciscan missionaries arrived in what is now Mexico , although they did not begin large-scale baptisms until 1537 , when Pope Paul III determined that the indigenous peoples did have souls . [ 174 ] Over the next 150 years , the missions expanded into southwestern North America . [ 175 ] The native people were legally defined as children , and the priests took on a paternalistic role , often enforced with corporal punishment . [ 176 ] In India , Portuguese missionaries and the Spanish Jesuit Francis Xavier evangelized among a Christian community which had been established by Thomas the Apostle . [ 177 ] I find a lot of this information very dubious . 	1
WTP	16164	Huge numbers were converted in Mexico before 1537 , and I don ' t think there was much serious debate over whether Indians had souls . 	0
WTP	16165	WHO legally defined native people as children , Church , Governments ? 	0

WTP	16294	Remember , this is not a list of definitive pseudosciences , but rather a list of characterizations . 	0
WTP	16295	This perpetrates the inherent bias of this article ' s inclusion criteria which allows for characterizations made by certain notable organizations and people , but disallows characterizations made by other organizations and people just as notable . 	0
WTP	16296	Because some editors feel that these organizations and researchers are in themselves pseuodskeptical and / or pseudoscientific , thus they are ill-equipped to label something a pseudoscience and therefore their views on what they characterize to be a pseudoscience should not be included in this list . 	0
WTP	16297	Why ? 	0
WTP	16298	Recent attempts to include significant views of certain notable organizations , notable academics and notable researchers have been summarily eliminated and denied from this article . 	0
WTP	16299	So , why are we including the characterizations made by these researchers and organizations , but excluding - and moreover disallowing - the characterizations made by other researchers and organizations . 	0
WTP	16300	While per WP : PSCI only a general consensus in the scientific community can truly label a topic as pseudoscience , this article includes entries of topics which have only been characterized as a pseudoscience by one researcher or by one skeptical organization and not the general scientific community . 	0

WTP	16325	Yes , I think the point that the article needs to have First Vision information in it is non-controversial , and prior to the edits there was info about the First Vision . 	0

WTP	16360	In any case , I ' m hesitant to call Obama Muslim based on the fourth-grade , partially for ethical reasons , as I don ' t believe in labelling children by religion before they can make a conscious decision , but also because multiple sources ( of which DfMF , AoH , or both , are included ) state that Lolo Soetoro and Ann Dunham emphasised comparative religion over indoctrination . 	1
WTP	16361	A 4th grade student may know what school he ' s attending , but a thirty-three year old looking back twenty-five years is going to make a few mistakes where he ' s simply forgotten . 	1

WTP	16374	The Vatican sees itself in direct competition with Islam . 	0

WTP	16641	What Ibaranoff needs to provide is a reliable source ( or several ) that explain why System of a Down shouldn ' t be classified as nu metal ; providing sources that simply don ' t say the words " nu metal " isn ' t the same thing . 	1

WTP	16657	The version you substituted left the word completely unmentioned , which does * not * aid understanding and accessibility . 	1

WTP	16730	Roman Catholic Church is part of Christianity and it would be inconsistent to make the comparison here , it would also be off topic for the subject matter of the page . 	0
WTP	16731	What you should do is make that kind of comparison on the Christianity article since you are comparing a whole faith to a whole faith - the number of Christians to the number of Muslims . 	1
WTP	16732	It seems like comparing apples to oranges to put any comment about Muslims outnumbering Roman Catholics . 	0
WTP	16733	This is more than mere History , it has to do with the present day and the two issues of Origin and Mission go together , they are entertwined with each other and extend beyond the concept of History with regards to the church ' s activities in the world today . 	0
WTP	16734	Also , eliminating the Nicene Creed will not help the reader who wants to know what the Catholic Church believes . 	1
WTP	16735	It would relegate the most important part of Roman Catholic Belief to a mere wikilink which I think makes an improper statement and moves the wikilinked page of Nicene Creed out of control of the Roman Catholic page . 	0
WTP	16736	Currently , I dont think the Nicene Creed page is a very good page and if our page eventually becomes FA , that would help the reader have confidence in what he or she is reading on the RCC page which should include the short Nicene Creed quote . 	0

WTP	16787	How very condescending of you . 	0
WTP	16788	So , Joseph Smith said he wished to know which " Christian Church " he should join ? 	0
WTP	16789	So , answer the question , what is your bias with regard to this article ? 	0
WTP	16790	Oh , wait , that ' s not " mainstream " because it doesn ' t have a negative stream of commentary following it and it is of LDS origin . OOPS , forget I mentioned that one . 	0
WTP	16791	Talk about the personal attacks getting way off , here is a reference for you : " The teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith . " 	0
WTP	16792	Guess who wrote most of the content . 	0
WTP	16793	I will keep that in mind when commenting in the future . 	0
WTP	16794	Point taken , I apologize . 	0
WTP	16795	Once again you are wrong , take a look at wikipedia commons there are graphic images of sexual acts available ( I can post some examples here if you still don ' t believe me ) , I suggest reading I don ' t like it is a bad reason to remove content 	0
WTP	16796	Hamas did bomb civilian targets , which is a terrorist tactic . 	0
WTP	16797	But the thing is , if we put this in the lead , it will not stop . 	0
WTP	16798	How can you claim that the UN report is a joke when we all saw with our own eyes the IDF bombing UNRWA schools with white phosphorus ? 	0
WTP	16799	And even if militants used the schools as Israel claims ( which is a doubt ) that is still not an excuse to bomb the schools . 	0
WTP	16800	Lastly , I do not object to the wording you have suggested in your last comment . 	0
WTP	16801	Have a nice day . 	0
WTP	16802	We will put this line in Hezbollah , PLO , and any other power that opposes Israel . 	0

WTP	16816	The whole idea of a " First Lady " is a sexist one that assumes that a wife ' s only duty is to serve her husband , and be a hostess . 	0
WTP	16817	The terms may sound silly , pompous , and old fashioned , but if that is an argument againt them , it is also an argument against both the names , but even more so the position and functions , of the " First Lady " and " First Gentleman " . 	0
WTP	16818	The titles mentioned of " First Master " and " First Lord " are in fact technically more accurate terms than " First Gentleman " , it ' s just that journalist and commentators seem to think that Gentleman is the equivalent of Lady in this context which , if you are pedantic , it isn ' t . 	0
WTP	16819	Yet present wording does mention the major events and provides wikilinks that Karanacs version would eliminate . 	0
WTP	16820	Responding to Karanacs : The present article wording does not mention justification of either Mary or Elizabeth ' s actions - it treats them equally - NPOV . 	0
WTP	16821	No offense , it is just my honest opinion . 	0
WTP	16822	I think present wording is more valuable and factually accurate that what Karanacs has proposed . 	1
WTP	16823	I am more interested in providing those facts and I dont think they make the article POV one way or the other . 	0

WTP	16827	At the time there was no disagreement that Great Britain ( with or without Northern Ireland ) was to be the successor state of the UK of Great Britain and Ireland . 	0
WTP	16828	Thus it is was the Free State that joined the League of Nations as an entirely new entity while the UK remained a member . 	0
WTP	16829	As a matter of English there ' s no ambiguity in saying that Northern Ireland remained in the UK . 	0
WTP	16830	Legally speaking it ' s the rules of state succession that determine whether the 1923 UK was the same state as the 1920 UK . 	0

WTP	16844	There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding regarding the role of the UGLE and the Grand Lodge of BC and Yukon , which I attempted to clear up with my various edits . 	0
WTP	16845	The United Grand Lodge of England is not the " official body of Freemasonry " , as none exists , but it is considered the standard for Masonic recognition ( there are exceptions , but Crowley wouldn ' t fit into one of them . ) 	0
WTP	16846	The Grand Loge de France violates Anderson ' s Constitutions by not requiring a belief in a Supreme Being ; as such , its regularity is not in question at all , but nonexistent . 	0
WTP	16847	In addition , recognition is not disputed by the Canadian body ( as mentioned before , no such dispute is necessary ) ; that organization simply functions as a repository of responses , original and reposted , to common anti-Masonic allegations . 	1
WTP	16848	Judas Priests contributions are not sourced either , so why should they have the right to be up there unsourced ? 	0
WTP	16849	This is actually the first time I have looked at the Obama page , and it ' s predictably predictable . 	0

WTP	16851	I notice on the Bush page regarding most of his major policies and decisions , there ' s always something negative about them tacked on someplace , how he was accused of this nefarious move or that nefarious deal . 	0

WTP	16867	This is consistent with similar articles and I think justified by wiki protocol . 	0
WTP	16868	In truth , the LAShTAL . com resources are significantly more extensive and comprehensive than the existing Wikipedia article . 	0
WTP	16869	I would posit that much of the information contained in the Wikipedia article is sourced from the research and effort of the LAShTAL . com membership . 	0
WTP	16870	For completeness , the Wikipedia article should point the user to LAShTAL . com . 	0
WTP	16871	The LAShTAL . com site is the home of the Aleister Crowley Society . 	0
WTP	16872	Based on a review of the LAShTAL . com site and WP : ELNO , I agree with Acsociety ' s assessment that the Aleister Crowley article ahould reference the LAShTAL . com site . 	1
WTP	16873	The LAShTAL . com resources are much more than collection links to existing work - they comprise the most accurate , scholarly analysis of the man and his works in any format . 	0
WTP	16874	As such , it is the recognized comprehensive authority on the life and works of Crowley and the repository of much original work on the topic . 	0

WTP	16877	As for the military suicide picture , we already have two black and white WWII images of dead people , so I think something a bit different would be preferable . 	1
WTP	16878	A picture of an electric chair would be more appropriate , or if we must continue to shock the reader , a person that has been hung with flies hovering over their corpse . 	0
WTP	16879	And as we ' ve said , this isn ' t capital punishment but a wartime mass execution of the perceived enemy . 	0
WTP	16880	There are already 2 others , and there was a third in the martyrdom section , which was again irrelevant . 	0
WTP	16881	The argument , as we ' ve made , is that there are already more than enough war pictures - there is more to death than images of people being shot dead in a war . 	1
WTP	16882	logic dictates you are either accepting " sky is not blue " or " there is a problem with your claim that prohibits me from understading it " . 	0
WTP	16883	holocaust denial is NOT providing an alternative claim but simply stating that certain claims are false ( not acceppting them ) . 	0
WTP	16884	so yes . 	0

WTP	16898	What ' s so unappealing about saying your band was the first metal group ? 	0
WTP	16899	Halford says Judas Priest was the first metal group ? 	0
WTP	16900	Ah , to rely on band members . 	0

WTP	16907	Can ' t we take some sort of poll to resolve this issue ? 	0

WTP	16913	I hold the position that personal lives are trivial within the scope of an individuals career , purely for the reason their personal life is obviously not their life ' s work . 	1
WTP	16914	The focus of an encyclopedia should be their contribution to their respective field , not tabloid journalism and the recent ( 10-20 year ) emphasis on detailing every forgettable factor of the lives of celebrities . 	1

WTP	16918	I don ' t know what you mean by " shock images " . 	0
WTP	16919	And from a pro-life perspective , such images would illustrate what they are fighting against ! 	0
WTP	16920	After all , they don ' t believe that foetuses are people , and they think that abortion is acceptable ! 	0
WTP	16921	The book said that large numbers of people were on the missions , but weren ' t officially baptized until after the pope ' s ruling . 	0
WTP	16922	So how could anybody , in all intellectual honesty , object ? ? 	0
WTP	16923	If other books dispute this , it can be removed , but I think it ' s accurate . 	1
WTP	16924	Your argument is not with me but with a Wikipedia content guideline and a number of editors who feel the same way . 	0
WTP	16925	I will not get drawn into your ad hominems , which distracts from the discussion . 	0

WTP	16930	What about Australian , Japanese , Russian , Chinese , Spanish etc . associations then ? 	0
WTP	16931	My concern is that , as soon as one breeder association gets linked , everybody feels another one would be just as important , and the section mutates into a business directory . 	0
WTP	16932	Certainly the oil spill is relevant to Obama ' s biography , but all the secondary details about other entities are most certainly not . 	0
WTP	16933	When editors / accounts new to this article post broadside attacks here on the integrity of Wikipedia they can stir up dissent but they don ' t get a whole lot of traction . 	0
WTP	16934	This should only be a summary of the specific aspects of the oil spill that relate to Obama . 	0

WTP	17094	For that , all you have to say is that the earth , or living material , is not a closed system and the second law says nothing about it . 	0

WTP	17112	A factual claim , right or wrong , is not criticism . 	0
WTP	17113	And what you ' re referring to is criticism in the sense of critique , something we don ' t really do for articles about people , but we do in say films , where many have a " critical reception " section . 	0
WTP	17114	That is the more serious proposal , covering people ' s negative opinions about Obama , and that is precisely what is discouraged on Wikipedia and has been rejected time after time . 	0
WTP	17115	That is normally based in fact , although there is a different sense ( one wholly unsuitable here ) for baseless negative assertions - but even those are assertions of opinion . 	0
WTP	17116	It would fit the Wikipedia concept of a coatrack . 	0
WTP	17117	Others refer to criticism as negative opinions about the facts of a thing , the oppositve of praise . 	0
WTP	17118	Responding to Jzyehoshua ' s point , you are referring to a different meaning of the word " criticism " . 	1
WTP	17119	What you initially proposed is that we include negative facts about Obama for the sake of including negative facts , which is not criticism at all . 	0
WTP	17120	And yes , I am disqualifying many of the accounts from which this was brought this up in the past - they are now banned as fake accounts , and the long-term editors here have been very wary of new accounts making similar proposals . 	0
WTP	17121	Anyway , it ' s very unlikely that the editors would agree now to adding a criticism section , and I ' m not sure how productive a protracted discussion would be here . 	0
WTP	17122	Yes , 	0

WTP	17125	I do recommend that those who are far more technically knowledgeable than I am should take a careful look at where and how HIV and AIDS can be made distinct in the text in order to avoid unnecessary conflation . 	1

WTP	17127	Well , that ' s a useful criticism , thank you , JoeSmack . 	0
WTP	17128	The new page could also address social ( young adults , thus orphans ) and political ( locations other than South Africa ) issues in more detail . 	0
WTP	17129	In such case , my opinion is that the Denialism section could be excised entirely and moved to the new page instead of being an awkward part of the HIV page . 	0
WTP	17130	Finally , if the issue really boils down to focusing more on the science ( which I generally support ) , perhaps yet another page could be created specifically about " HIV and AIDS Linkage " or some similar title . 	0

WTP	17132	Aha - You ' ve let your raison d ' etre slip - a line intentionally inserted to place the blame firmly on unionists for causing the split . 	0

WTP	17194	Even if the content were well-sourced , and of sufficient weight to include in the encyclopedia somewhere ( neither of which are the case ) , it is not pertinent to the subject of this article . 	0
WTP	17195	Although the Washington Times is sometimes a reliable source for some content , it is problematic when it comes to politics due to the paper ' s strong conservative bent , lackluster respect for factual accuracy ( often mischaracterizing or printing unsubstantiated facts to support its position ) , and being very sloppy about distinguishing opinion and propaganda from factual reportage . 	1
WTP	17196	This article is a case in point . 	0
WTP	17197	It is masquerading as a news story , but it uses phrases like " back door " and conjecture like " the memo suggests that . . . " , amidst a highly selective choice of quotes , to hide what is partly an opinion and speculation piece . 	0
WTP	17198	Regarding weight here or anywhere , the substance is that a second or third tier official approved a report written by four staffers ( or something like that ) proposing a form of immigration amnesty . 	0
WTP	17199	There is nothing in the source that says it has anything to do with Obama , or is anywhere close to getting enacted . 	0

WTP	17227	Hence why I said we should wait for the court ruling agreeing with the administration ' s argument that the mandate is a tax . 	0

WTP	17390	That CCHR is a " pseudoskeptical organization " is just a judgment of a Fyslee ( I tend to agree FWIW ) , but even if it was a judgment of another reliable source , that still doesn ' t disqualify the CCHR as a notable skeptical organization which has characterized something as pseudoscience . 	0

WTP	17462	Traditional heavy metal primarily draws from two sources ( one a foreign language source ) , so it ' s in no way indicative of all research available on metal . 	0
WTP	17463	Also , I ' ve long advocated that that page be redirected here ( you don ' t have a " traditional punk rock " article , for comparison ' s sake ) , but the editors who work on that page have been staunchy against that in the past , even though it ' s more or less redundant to this article . 	0
WTP	17464	Of course , some UN or other civilian installations were hit , some with good reason ( any military use cancels the place ' s protection according to the Geneva Conventions ) ; some were hit by error - nothing and no-one is 100% accurate , and when people send rockets from the middle of the city , innocents are bound to get hurt . 	0

WTP	17479	CCHR is clearly not a reliable source for declaring what is and what isn ' t a pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	17480	Does this make sense ? 	0
WTP	17481	Characterized = point of view and hence this article should adhere to NPOV by presenting all significant POVs . 	0
WTP	17482	I will try to help you as much as I can since I am very interested in this subject and I think we could make this not just a good but a featured article one day . 	0

WTP	17484	If you want me to nitpick for a possible improvement I would say scrap the hearse pic and here ' s why . 	1
WTP	17485	This then raises the question of NPOV , which seems to be violated by granting undue weight to the sex abuse scandals . 	0
WTP	17486	Now , if the argument is that the article can ' t be FA unless the lead includes the sex abuse scandals , and we want FA rather than follow WP guidelines , well that ' s ok with me . 	0
WTP	17487	The abuse scandals hardly rate when compared with the other controversies that have surrounded the church . 	0

WTP	17491	The position Ling . 	0
WTP	17492	Nut advocates distorts historical perspective ; compared with other controversies , the sex abuse scandals are barely notable , and including it in the lead gives them far more than their due weight . 	0

WTP	17533	There I found the allegations of phosphorus weapon use , so I proceeded to add a few tightly written sentences including citations plus internal and external links . 	0
WTP	17534	So is the " undue weight " argument that that these allegations and countercharges among young Israeli soldiers , with serious repercussions throughout Israeli society , isn ' t as " heavy " as charges of phosphorus weapons use and can ' t appear beside it ? 	0
WTP	17535	I felt the content is relevant in light of interest among the English-language readership ( some of whom are likely to view it as fuel for criticism of the IDF and Israel ; hence my unfortunate use here of the terms " atrocities and war crimes " that I trusted was certainly not to be read as any agenda of my own ! ) . 	0
WTP	17536	It seemed to me a clear case relating to the Israel Defense Forces # Code of Conduct ( not , as you suggest , Purity of Arms ) â but as there ' s no specific incident under that heading , I posted under the heading Controversy . 	0

WTP	17570	Please . . . . . . when you DO make this argument . . . . . . . . remember to include all of the evidence that israeli " military action " has been successful in advancing israel ' s war against the Palestinians / Lebonese ( gaining military advantages anticipated ) . 	0
WTP	17571	Here ' s MY evidence that this is NOT true : http://a.abcnews.com/m/screen?id=6760726&pid=76 http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/palestinian-attacks-signal-failure-of-military-offensive-652232.html http://origin.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,244139,00.html http://www.ifamericansknew.org/stats/un.html http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article692233.ece 4 . 	1
WTP	17572	. . . so the Geneva Conventions DON ' T support your argument that Hamas ' actions differ from those of U . S . / israel . 	0
WTP	17573	No doubt you will bring attention to the statement : " . . . would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated " . . . in order to argue that U .

WTP	17580	I don ' t think we should only treat the scientific aspects as a default , though we need much more material on this subject than we currently have , and as I mentioned I think the length of the culture section gives undue weight at its current size , though it could probably be expanded much further still with ease . 	0
WTP	17581	As for only treating scientific aspects , that ' s what we used to do , but the culture article was merged here to cover it all in one subject . 	0

WTP	17595	This is sensible advice because linking someone ' s words to a Wiki article can impose a meaning on those words that is not contained in the statement they made and consequently it can mislead readers . 	0
WTP	17596	My understanding of that statement is that it means , if it is possible to avoid linking from within quotes , avoid linking from within quotes . 	0
WTP	17597	Also Ibranoff , if you are going to keeping insisting " The sources clearly state that they are not nu metal " , you need to provide those sources so they can be evaluated . 	0

WTP	17609	OK , but as it is repeated , should the copy in the lede stay ? 	1
WTP	17610	I would suggest no , and to keep the copy in the Beliefs section . 	1
WTP	17611	In the lede it sounds quite a bit more specific and indeed almost narrow in context , whereas the rest of the lede is very general , broad , and top-down sounding . 	0

WTP	17613	Further , I find it curious that I am being urged by several people ( unquestionably dedicated , but perhaps a bit narrow-minded ) to " use the Talk page " when those same people have repeatedly avoided addressing some of the issues I have raised here on Talk about the usability of this article . 	1

WTP	17618	Now to address your point Bleh - your argument regarding sexual images is moot ; there are of course such images at commons if people want to see them , just as there are plenty of gory images of dead people and such , but there is no photograph on sexual intercourse of two individuals at the height of copulation . 	0
WTP	17619	Regarding pictures from long past wars , there obviously won ' t be anything in the form of a photograph , but there plenty of paintings etc . I had a very brief look for something suitable but there was nothing that especially caught my eye . 	0
WTP	17620	There is already a picture from a 20th century war just below in the suicide attack section , as well as the image of American graves in the lead , so I believe it would be more balanced to include something from times long past , like artwork from a chariot battle for example . 	0
WTP	17621	There is no need to show the most graphic or pornographic image just because one is available , and if an image is controversial for whatever reason there should be at least some rationale for keeping it . 	0
WTP	17622	It probably doesn ' t deserve any more than a sentence but not mentioning it could be seen as inconsistent with NPOV requirements . 	0

WTP	17626	It would not preclude attributing the material to the author of the work , but as such that should probably be made explicit for clarity . 	0
WTP	17627	What it does preclude is simply attribution of its material to the institutional church itself , as that would be the posterchild of original research . 	0
WTP	17628	Just two cents : the lack of either decree does not in and of itself preclude the use of a source here . 	1
WTP	17629	Glad everyone got back on track here . 	0
WTP	17630	That has been gone over already , Dynablaster provided a list of secondary sources , just waiting for him to include them . 	0

WTP	17680	What you want to prove with this outburst is confusing ; what you do try to achieve , seemingly , is dismissing practically everything that backs my statement ; be it magazines , reviews , general " misconception " or wikipedia-articles . 	0
WTP	17681	And how do you manage this ? 	0
WTP	17682	The final sentence of that section is a run-on , includes the bizarrely contorted phrase " acceptance of denialism " , and the redundant " no validity " after " reject " . 	0

WTP	17692	I ' m overwhelmed . 	0
WTP	17693	Even though I fail to see the meaning of that article , and how it contradicts this one , it is more accurate in its depict of the musical interrelations of the early bands , with emphasis on Black Sabbath . . 	0
WTP	17694	but hey , that ' s the case with a few 100 , 000 articles here on this second hand source page . 	0
WTP	17695	How do you know Black Sabbath ' s importance is false , a myth ? 	0
WTP	17696	The comment about " over-reliance on confirmation rather than refutation " strikes me as odd : not only unsupported by WP , but contradicting the scientific nature of this topic which has inspired very careful research for over two decades . 	1
WTP	17697	The paragraph where Black Sabbath , Deep Purple , and Led Zeppelin are mentioned as pioneers of the genre is invalid ; it states that all three bands were reviled by critics . 	1
WTP	17698	First off , Deep Purple met indifference in their start , which is not the same as being reviled , which their albums never were . 	0
WTP	17699	With their success that followed in the U . S . , they were , however , acclaimed . 	0
WTP	17700	Secondly , Led Zeppelin never met criticism like that of Black Sabbath ; Zeppelin were , instead , criticized for not being as good as , according to Rolling Stone in the review of their first album , like The Jeff Beck Group , and Robert Plant was compared condescendingly to Rod Stewart . 	0
WTP	17701	Basically , not the same kind of criticism Black Sabbath got . 	0
WTP	17702	Sabbath were persistently rejected until their fifth album ( I dislike referring to wikipedia articles , but this is backed by the articles for all their first five albums ) Sabbath Bloody Sabbath . 	0
WTP	17703	The criticism was a direct result of their alien-sounding music , which clashed with the current , which was blues-inspired Hard rock , like Zeppelin , Purple , Iron Butterfly etc . To conclude , the introduction falters and misleads , and should be rewritten more accurately . 	0

WTP	17741	There is no sound argument to back the assertion that " progressive rock , art rock , experimental rock and alternative metal are used more often in relation to the band ' s music " . 	0

WTP	17748	What it does tell us , in conjunction with the other article from prominent pre-1900 members of the church is that there was a discussion about Smith ' s claims to have seen a Vision and that vision involved God . 	0

WTP	17753	Smith did not claim to " frequently seeing God " just as you say , however what is interesting about this article is when it is taken in context with Smith ' s own writings of how the community received his ideas does support his claims , if somewhat indirectly . 	0

WTP	17756	As for Professor Anderson ' s and other LDS scholars seeming disqualification because they are LDS , from what basis is that authoritative dismissal given ? 	0

WTP	17784	I haven ' t seen evidence that the level of cover-up that occurred in the RCC has also occurred in Protestant denominations ; if that ' s just my ignorance , then info on Protestant coverups could be offered as a comparison . 	0

WTP	17798	When you look through most other photos , you see the caption is a description given to what the user sees in the photo . 	0
WTP	17799	As I understand it , a caption given by an uploader or by a flikr stream owner is unverifiable and as such not according to WP standards . 	0
WTP	17800	Often it adds information that is only evident to a professional ( explaining that the rhino in the picture is an african rhino ) but a caption should not add information not evident in the photo ( explaining that the rhino ' s name is Susan ) , unless this information can be sourced . 	0
WTP	17801	Unfortunately , it ' s a Pay-Per-View , and I can only get the title and first line , though these are clear enough to illustrate my point . 	0

WTP	17851	This proves , beyond the possibility of argument , that Palestine IS a state , and therefore under U . S . law , cannot be included under the definition of " terrorism " . 	1

WTP	17872	Your pretense at neutrality by noting that a shock propaganda photo of a dead mom ( a very rare victim of a botched illegal abortion ) is also prohibited ( to suggest the " rule " is balanced ) is extremely transparent . 	0

WTP	17901	Nothing else passes , and any complaints are called " disruptive " . 	0
WTP	17902	Obviously the only thing that counts as " improving " an article here is a positive entry for a Democrat and a negative for a Republican . 	0
WTP	17903	It goes on all over Wikipedia . 	0
WTP	17904	Time and time again I have watched legitimate topics and stories from legitimate sources get shot down because a Democrat is in question , while clear left wing sources count as " reliable " when it ' s a Republican . 	0

WTP	17908	Things in the UK certainly haven ' t got to quite the level that they have in the States , with Dioceses going into bankruptcy , but I really don ' t think you can that there is no problem with how the issue has been dealt with . 	1
WTP	17909	As I ' ve pointed out before , it has been enough of an issue in the UK that a previous Archbishop of Cardiff had to resign over his handling of abuse cases , and Cormac Murphy-O ' Connor also received pretty major coverage for his handling of a case when he was at Arundel ( less justifiably in that case certainly ) . 	0

WTP	17911	If Bush ' s front page for example is going to mention nice little subtlely negative implications and the controversies and criticisms surrounding his policies , and on just about every part of his bio , Obama ' s should too . 	0

WTP	17915	It simply isn ' t balanced in my humble opinion . 	1
WTP	17916	I see him and all of his policies made out to look fantastic here , and some of the entries make sure to point out how he ' s reversed Bush ' s policies , in a presumably positive way . 	0
WTP	17917	Even if the establishment liberal network media steadfastly refuses to cover most of it , and attacks those who do . 	0
WTP	17918	I don ' t see that , and much controversy and criticism certainly exists with Obama and his policies . 	0

WTP	17927	It couldn ' t remain in something that ceased to exist ! 	0
WTP	17928	I disagree with this , and feel that use of the term ( heavy metal ) throughout the ' 70s was largely consistent with modern standards , and much of the crossing of " hard rock " and " heavy metal " very probably arose from the fact that many hard rock bands of the time did a few metal songs . 	0
WTP	17929	There are even exceptions to this ( particularly ZZ Top , Lynyrd Skynyrd , Foghat , and Meat Loaf ) . 	0

WTP	18570	Feel free to rewrite the section , but please try not to place undue weight on recent events ( Cast Lead , and even the 2006 Lebanon War attracted undue attention on Wikipedia in general , unlike for example the much bigger 1956 Sinai War ) . 	0
WTP	18571	Now , I agree that the controversy section is severely lacking ( in quality , not length ) , and IMO one of the reasons is that this article does not have many dedicated editors . 	0
WTP	18572	There is no reason to detail each incident , and certainly not in the context of soldiers ' coming out ' to ' reveal ' something about the IDF , as indeed there is an entire organization in Israel devoted to this very purpose , which is not mentioned even once in the article . 	0
WTP	18573	Even if many notable organizations accuse the IDF of war crimes here , the article should take a more general approach , such as " The IDF was accused of war crimes for its actions in several operations , including Sabra and Shatila and Operation Cast Lead . [ ref ] " . 	0

WTP	18748	The page on undue weight includes this : Other minority views may require much more extensive description of the majority view in order to avoid misleading the reader . 	0
WTP	18749	Thus , we see what is IMO a blatant POV term such as " denialism " instead of skepticism or " alternative explanations " in the section heading that gives lip service to other viewpoints . 	0

WTP	18786	Just like the headline figure of 4 , 00o clerics accused of sex abuse in the US , it has no context unless you add that in the 40 year period covered there were hundreds of thousands of priests and religious serving in the US . 	0
WTP	18787	The original sources , one of which was Kamen , actually said that the Spanish Inquisition sentenced 3-4% of convicted people to death over its existence , ( technically , released to the civil authority , ) but that only half of these executions were actually carried out . 	0

WTP	18822	As it stands now though , the article allows for the inclusion of items which are not pseudosciences - yet they are included in the list because some notable source has characterized it as such . 	0
WTP	18823	Again , if this article was simply " List of Pseudosciences " where we could only include entries that are either obvious pseudosciences or generally considered pseudoscience by the scientific community , then we would not be dealing with this NPOV issue . 	0
WTP	18824	" Pseudoscience " is the characterization du jour and Scientology is a notable source ( not a reliable source of labelling something " pseudoscience " , but a notable source nonetheless which has made such a characterization ) . 	0

WTP	19182	Westcoast , as far as I can tell Storm Rider ' s argument is not that the problem is that of " a collection of a few sinful individuals " but that the normal rates of human sexual deviance are going to be found in the Catholic Church . 	0

WTP	19191	Failure to extensively cover the constant attacks that are the stuff of politics in a biography of a person does not represent a political bias in favor of that person , it is an encyclopedic approach to writing biographies . 	1

WTP	19196	However , it is in danger of turning into an edit war , and both sides should discuss the issue here to seek consensus . 	0
WTP	19197	This is not vandalism , it is a content . 	0
WTP	19198	I can see two solutions : Personally , I prefer my suggested " technically left and rejoined " wording , because with the addition of only 3 extra words it conveys a much richer picture of what happened than either of two disputed versions . 	1
WTP	19199	The full situation is explained rather well in a succinct paragraph in the history section , but the " rejoined " summary in the intro could mislead the reader into believing that Northern Ireland tried out life in the Free State for a while before packing its bags and going back to London . 	0
WTP	19200	This sort of technical hiatus applies in all sorts of situations , and should of course be described where the issue is considered in detail â¦ but in a one-sentence summary to describe the situation solely as a " rejoining " is misleading . 	1

WTP	19231	In a summary ( that is supposed to be simple ) why confuse and mislead the reader with unimportant technicalities that are absolutely meaningless in the long run ? 	0
WTP	19232	The situation was straightforward and very simple : Therefore , north stays and south leaves . 	0
WTP	19233	Who cares about the meaningless details in a transitional process when all that ' s important is the end result . 	0
WTP	19234	For a summary , keep the key facts that allow a new reader to understand what happened . 	0
WTP	19235	Adding the word ' technically ' may be correct to an extent , but is still misleading in a summary for someone who knows nothing about Ireland . 	0
WTP	19236	BrownHairedGirl - I am against your ' compromise ' proposal , because they are essentially no different than what " O ' Fenian " initially has said , and still implies the same PoV that he wants . 	1
WTP	19237	Why in a summary are there no details about many of the other events during the Viking and Norman ages , but for this particular event you feel compelled to add minute and misleading detail . 	0
WTP	19238	O ' Fenian has made it clear that he wants the article to imply that partition was the fault of unionists , and for you to add one more word in detail does no more to remove that PoV . 	0

WTP	19241	I must remind you that Wikipedia is not censored Yes we may have things here that you may find objectionable but that is not a reason to not include the content if it is freely licensed and appropriate for the topic ( death ) , death and destruction is not pretty and perhaps those who promote it will reconsider after seeing the end results , it ' s not a picture of capital punishment , but appropriate for the murder / homicide section if there is one in this article . 	1

WTP	19257	While I fully agree with the concerns of recentism and historical balance ( consider in 1000 years what this article would look like : this flap would barely get a footnote if that ! ) , I also recognize the empirical reality Karanacs and others have mentioned , that if no mention is made in the lede , editors less informed about the editorial issues here will even in good faith bombard it with edits to mention it . 	0

WTP	19273	I ' m not sure of your claim that pharmaceutical abortions are more prevalent than surgical ones . 	0
WTP	19274	However , I agree with you about those who seek to portray all abortions in the same way ( although it is * quite * possible to find quite graphic photos for most surgical procedures and the saline abortion method ) . 	0
WTP	19275	I also agree that too many people are out to use the article to score political points , not to create an encyclopedia . 	0
WTP	19276	( I dispute that this is a " functional " tactic , as you put it ; for various reasons , it almost invariably backfires on the anti-abortionist who presents the image . 	0

WTP	19280	I don ' t have clue what he said . 	0
WTP	19281	Can anyone give a cite for Kermit speaking at Henson ' s funeral ( outside of a video retrospective or something of the sort ) ? 	0
WTP	19282	I think whoever added that info is confusing Edgar Bergen ' s funeral with Henson ' s - - since Henson and Kermit did speak at that funeral . 	1
WTP	19283	I don ' t think Kermit spoke at Henson ' s funeral . 	1
WTP	19284	Steve Whitmire was not officially named as Henson ' s successor for Kermit until MUCH later , and his first appearance performing Kermit was in the special the Muppet did remembering Jim Henson . 	0
WTP	19285	( Outdent ) For the sake of accuracy , it must be noted that Crowley MORE THAN ONCE claimed to be a Freemason . 	0
WTP	19286	It seems that Crowley was asked to become a Freemason but was thrown out of the United Grand Lodge almost immediately . 	1

WTP	19291	Without the quote the reader is left to rely on the opinion from editor ' s who haven ' t researched into the matter as much as the sources of the quote . 	0
WTP	19292	This quote also comes from the institution that has done the most research into the matter and adds to the professionalism and credibility of the paragraph and article . 	0
WTP	19293	It ' s good to appear unbias , but this ideal should not take away from the facts of history , that have been thoroughly researched . 	0
WTP	19294	The scholars and research into the Book of Mormon show this statement to be historically accurate . 	0

WTP	19301	Is your issue with stating " vast majority " ? 	0

WTP	19304	Biodiversity does not have to increase . 	1
WTP	19305	The current trees produced go back to approx 550 million years back ( based on Cambrian explosion ) , that is our tree of biodiversity based on fossils , molecular similarity , etc etc . The fact that the tree converges to a common ancestor is based on evidence quite different from the evidence used to justify our current tree for biodiversity . 	1
WTP	19306	That ' s why biodiversity and common ancestor are two different theories that complement each other . 	0
WTP	19307	Saying that drift and selection do not produce diversity is therefore a very wrong statement . 	1
WTP	19308	You have to differentiate biodiversity from common ancestor . 	0
WTP	19309	Mutations , by themselves , will never produce diversity without a mechanism to retain the beneficial ones . 	0
WTP	19310	So mutation is the raw material for these two mechanisms to produce diversity . 	0
WTP	19311	You are very confused about evolution . 	0
WTP	19312	Drift and selection are mechanisms that act on mutations to produce diversity . 	0

WTP	19321	This is not an article which list things that are pseudoscience ; rather it is an article which list things that have been characterized as pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	19322	My thought here is that since this is merely an article of significant points of view , that CCHR is in fact a reliable source of their organization ' s point of view . 	0
WTP	19323	Of course sentimental patriots among homesick members of the Lebanese diaspora just love to hear about their intrepid and successful Phoenician ancestors â and so much like the modern Lebanese themselves , needless to say . . . " Popular " indeed , in every sense . 	0

WTP	19330	We have a similar section in Bush ' s article about Katrina . 	0
WTP	19331	However , your addition introduced some content that may need better verification or qualification ; I see that the only source verifying criticism of Obama and / or BP â and it undoubtedly exists â is the Christian Science Monitor ( who , I ' ll hazard a guess , supported exploratory off-shore drilling before this happened ) , and I don ' t really think they ' re a reliable source . 	1

WTP	19354	I would definitely call their fourth album more folk rock than heavy metal , and I ' m not only referring to " Stairway To Heaven " , but also to " The Battle of Evermore " and " Going To California " ; three folk rock songs against zero heavy metal songs clarify . 	0
WTP	19355	And Led Zeppelin are often called folk rock ! 	0
WTP	19356	And I didn ' t get offended one bit by you swearing , I just satirized wikipedian policy . 	0
WTP	19357	Basically everything that ' s played in a minor pentatonic scale ( the final verses are in natural minor , the common minor scale , which is used by guys like Beethoven , for example ) is blues to you , and that ' s a very amateur approach , I must say . 	0
WTP	19358	I have already remarked on your less knowledgeable status as a musician which is clearly visible ; the final verses of " Black Sabbath " are in a minor scale and not bluesy in any way , but since you see them as blues , I kind of get where you ' re coming from . 	0

WTP	19430	As for Grand Funk , I kind of doubt that Sabbath never heard them ( Grand Funk was actually covered by a South African group before 1973 ) but I guess that doesn ' t particularly matter . 	1
WTP	19431	I agree that Sabbath and Deep Purple weren ' t as bluesy as Zeppelin , but I still don ' t think Sabbath takes a ( very large ) step away from those influences in Sabbath Bloody Sabbath . 	0
WTP	19432	Ah . 	0
WTP	19433	The term apparently did exist by that point ( the first use by a critic according to this article was in 1968 ) , though it seemingly ( again , according to this article and its sources ) wasn ' t used by a writer in a context ( relatively ) in line with its current until 1971 on Sir Lord Baltimore . 	0

WTP	19437	I think maybe anywhere from In Rock to Machine Head could have been it , though I think their ' 60s material was much more exclusively hard rock . 	0
WTP	19438	" Highway Star " is sort of the prototype for a lot of speed metal and flashy ' 80s stuff , while " War Pigs " was obviously very influential to a lot of the doom metal and ' stoner metal ' material from the ' 70s ( Pentagram , Bedemon ) on . 	0

WTP	19446	I want to see citations to EMPIRICAL evidence references that contradict my edits to the lead . 	1
WTP	19447	That being said , many people , but not all , with AIDS test positive for HIV . 	1
WTP	19448	To date , there is NOT ONE SINGLE study , paper , reproducible experiment , photograph , video or lab result that supports HIV being the cause if AIDS . 	0
WTP	19449	The word empirical denotes information gained by means of observation , experience , or experiment .

WTP	19450	Before you make biased and uneducated statements regarding a degree of scientific and linguistic comprehension that are being debated by Nobel Laureates , scientists , doctors and researches the globe over , perhaps you should read a REFERENCE or two supporting your statements . 	0

WTP	19453	There are another 10% of the HIV + population that have never developed AIDS despite not taking ARVs . 	0

WTP	19455	The CNN article said that : " Before undergoing the transplant , the patient was also found to be infected with low levels of a type of HIV known as X4 , which does not use the CCR5 receptor to infect cells . 	0
WTP	19456	A rough analogy would be Al Capone operated Soup Kitchens in the 1930 some people considered him a gangster 	0
WTP	19457	Keepcalmandcarryon , I did not state that the treatment causes resistance to CXCR4 I merely pointed out that Hutter ' s patient did have the CXCR4 virus before the treatment which is a fact . 	1
WTP	19458	In one of the edits you reverted I had added a CNN article as a reference which had information about this issue . 	0
WTP	19459	" This finding is very surprising . " 	0
WTP	19460	As such the use of the term " Resistance to CCR5 inhibition is also less important if CXCR4 strains of HIV emerge ( these use CXCR4 rather than CCR5 as a coreceptor , from which they become independent ) , and the patient carried this virus at low levels " is fairly deceptive since it implies that this treatment does nothing for the CXCR4 virus . 	1
WTP	19461	However , following the transplant , signs of leukemia and HIV were absent . 	0
WTP	19462	" There is no really conclusive explanation why we didn ' t observe any rebound of HIV , " Hutter said . 	0

WTP	19467	I ' m sure we can find some mainstream criticisms of certain aspects of psychiatry from truly skeptical sources . 	0
WTP	19468	I also want to add that the Siena College Poll is a well respected poll for Presidential rankings , and has been one of the main contributors to those rankings for almost 30 years . 	0
WTP	19469	There is no problem with the poll or any question at all about the criteria used . 	0

WTP	19472	Looks good to me . 	0
WTP	19473	But anyway , even if it were a criticism we don ' t divide the article into criticism and praise sections , but rather work things into the right article ( s ) in due proportion to their biographical importance and relevance . 	0
WTP	19474	The birther stuff is somewhere between a fringe conspiracy theory and a political smear . 	0

WTP	19481	Im sorry but the wording is currently VERY misleading and such inaccurate statements should not be allowed to remain for too long . 	0
WTP	19482	I support changing it to suggestion one then . 	1

WTP	19486	If Israel were sincerely concerned about peace and minimizing civilian casualties , it would end the siege in Gaza and negotiate with the Palestinian resistance . 	0
WTP	19487	The fact that Israel dropped bombs on civilian areas in one of the most densely populated regions of the world is overwhelming evidence that the intent was to kill civilians . 	1
WTP	19488	My comment was related to the former . 	0
WTP	19489	The latter admittedly has less information about its review system , but is there a reason for your assertion that it was not peer-reviewed ? 	0

WTP	19508	And also an indication of whether there is a privileged partner status of some sort which means that Israel is one of a special list of allies allowed to buy the current stuff rather then the previous generation of equipment ? 	0
WTP	19509	What would also be useful would be an indication of how specific this aid is . 	1

WTP	19530	Thank you for self-reverting . 	0
WTP	19531	You need a reliable source which refutes the claim . 	0
WTP	19532	On the other hand , the current source does not make the claim ; it merely reports that his weblog makes the claim . 	1

WTP	19570	3 : Regarding your third point , I must not be grasping the distinction of the point you are trying to make . 	0
WTP	19571	The title has the dual meaning of " hostess " and " wife " , and the two do not need to be the same . 	0

WTP	19647	I ' ve already addressed that argument , several times : Putting aside the veracity of the claim that the charge was " rejected " in the Hezbollah case ( it was not ) , it is irrelevant editorializing to imply that what was claimed in one different instance ( different time , different place , different organization ) is also the case in this instance . 	1
WTP	19648	In the discussion above under the heading Misleading Description of Partition , editors are unable to agree on a form of summary wording to use in the lead section of this article to describe the fate of Northern Ireland under the Anglo-Irish Treaty . 	1
WTP	19649	One side insists that it is right to say that Northern Ireland " remained in the United Kingdom " ; the other prefers to say that it " rejoined the United Kingdom " . 	0
WTP	19650	From what I can see , neither side is wrong , but it appears that the reality is more complex than is implied by either of those short phrases . 	0
WTP	19651	The underlying facts do not seem to be in dispute , and are set out in detail both later this article at Ireland # History and also in Northern Ireland # History . 	0
WTP	19652	The treaty provided that Northern Ireland would become part of the Irish Free State , but would have the right to opt out and become part of the United Kingdom . 	1
WTP	19653	There appears to be agreement that there was clear expectation on all sides that it would do so , and this was done immediately after the treaty came into effect . 	1
WTP	19654	The whole process , which involved the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland travelling overland to London to personally present the documents , took 48 hours . 	1
WTP	19655	I have seen no suggestion either in this discussion or in related articles that at any point in those 48 hours the Irish Free State had any practical control of affairs within Northern Ireland . 	0
WTP	19656	So I suggested a compromise wording : " technically left and rejoined the United Kingdom " . 	0
WTP	19657	That has been rejected by both sides , with demands for references for the use of the adjective " technically " . 	0

WTP	19663	As well as the sentence been recentist , it paints a bias athiest / protestant centric picture that in the modern day , the Catholic Church has no worth and its only standing is for the sensationalistic American media to whine about its followers and highlight some of the negatives ( sex abuse scandal ) , while giving attention to none of the positives . 	0

WTP	19671	As for etymologies , as I note above , you clearly had no problem with keeping in the article the fact that the word referring to the animal has changed in English because you didn ' t remove the mention of it in your original edit . 	1
WTP	19672	Therefore I fail to see how taking the logical next step and explaining why this happened , with multiple reliable sources to back it up , is a problem . 	0

WTP	19679	You yourself partly justified Elizabeth ' s repressions by referring to the threat of invasion and internal rebellion . 	0
WTP	19680	That ' s fairly obvious , just like a history or pattern of lies , misbehavior or criminal behavior by Hamas would be relevant when they seemed to state a similar lie in 2008 or were accused of similar misbehavior or criminal behavior in 2008 or 2009 . 	0
WTP	19681	But my reference in the " Proximity to Civilians . . . " section to the Salon article about Hezbollah - - " the same accusation was rejected when it was made during Israel ' s 2006 war against Hezbollah in Lebanon . [ 184 ] " - - has been repeatedly removed here without explanation . 	0

WTP	19689	You haven ' t addressed the argument above at all . 	0

WTP	19692	Comment Well , it would be strange to " support " myself , but to repeat it : I think that the article needs a lead image that stands for " death " as broadly as possible , at least broadly for human death , which is what the article does focus on . 	0
WTP	19693	Instead of the painting ( which I inserted after suggesting it here and receiving no response for several days ) I would also agree with any other image of a human skull , although I think that the painting is very fitting . 	0

WTP	19706	It also lets us side-step the question of Smith ' s precise meaning . 	0
WTP	19707	I doubt the term sect had the same pejorative connotation in the 1830s as it does today , though certainly Smith was antisectarian , and like any Christian primitivist in the 1820s thought that sects and denominations were a corruption of the Christian church . 	1
WTP	19708	But rather than trying to parse the primary sources ourselves ( which could be [ [ WP : OR | original research ) , I think we ought to let the secondary sources guide us . 	0
WTP	19709	When Jan Shipps describes the vision story in her Mormonism ( 1985 ) book , page 9 , she uses the word sects in quotes : " this theophany answered the lad ' s question about which of the ' sects ' were right and which were wrong . " 	0
WTP	19710	Maybe that ' s the proper approach . 	1
WTP	19711	I don ' t think it ' s wrong , or necessarily non-neutral , to use a word like church or denomination in this context , but using Smith ' s own language--like Shipps does--has the added advantage of reflecting the flavor of Smith ' s early anti-sectarian views which he shared with other Christian primitivists . 	0
WTP	19712	I know some of the existing secondary sources , like Bushman ' s Smith biography , don ' t really make a distinction between church , denomination , and sect , but that ' s probably just because the authors haven ' t specifically thought of it as an issue . 	0

WTP	19720	' Crucifixion of St . Peter , by Caravaggio ' is also POV from a religious viewpoint and we should look for an alternative for this image . 	1
WTP	19721	Basically the argument boils down to censorship and this is not allowed by policy , and as someone else noted previously above we should have pictures of dead humans or animals to illustrate the topic of death not ' less offensive ' alternatives , some of which are off topic in this article . 	0

WTP	19730	This would be a completely useful list , rather than the mess we are working on now ! 	0
WTP	19731	My guess as to why we haven ' t adopted this obvious and logical solution is that some editors want so badly to associate certain non-pseudoscientific topics with pseudoscience , that they are willing to throw NPOV and logic out the window just for the satisfaction of including such topics in this muddled and unencyclopaedic list . 	0

WTP	19736	Now then , if that is a problem for us - if we cannot comply with NPOV - then I suggest ( as I have often suggested ) that this article becomes the very definitive " List of pseudosciences " and adheres strictly to the guidelines of WP : PSCI ( part of NPOV ) ; whereas we would only be able to include items which have been deemed pseudosciences per the general opinion of the scientific community . 	0

WTP	19758	Frankly , the " but other articles do it " defense doesn ' t hold water . 	1
WTP	19759	Other than being uninformative , it is my opinion that such images would detract from the quality of this article , by lessening its stringent adherance to NPOV . 	0

WTP	19879	When do the sources actually say that ? 	0
WTP	19880	If " hard rock " is vague in any sense other than its direct relation to metal , it ' s because of its use as an umbrella term , which I suspect is only partially connected to hard rock as a genre in-and-of itself . 	1

WTP	19940	It ' s so obvious , it ' s ridiculous . 	0
WTP	19941	It doesn ' t matter what you put here , they will run you around with their own biased logic as to why it isn ' t " reliable " . 	1
WTP	19942	Burying Mission in Church will really make that important paragraph obscure and placing origins in hisory will make that paragraph disconnect with Beliefs for which it is a logical precursor based on Jesus promise to St Peter " What you bind on Earth will be bound in Heaven " . 	0
WTP	19943	These two items : Origins and Mission relate to the current activity of the church in the world today - not just history and thus they cant be considered history alone . 	1
WTP	19944	Also , I want to add that I thought all of Karanacs comments on Peer Review were fine with a couple small exceptions and I plan to address all of them eventually . 	0
WTP	19945	The logic flows well since you have the church being founded and its mission defined which directly affects the formation of its Beliefs . 	1
WTP	19946	It tells the reader the Why . 	0
WTP	19947	The church operates its many churches , missions and social ministries around the world today in response to a Gospel event discussed in the Mission paragraph . 	0
WTP	19948	Answering the question of Where did it come from is one of the first questions readers will have about the church - see the FA on Islam which actually puts the answers to this question in the lead and expands on it there as well . 	0
WTP	19949	Origins tells the reader Where did it come from which I think is an important question to answer up front since the Gospel passage in the origins section is the basis for the church existence . 	0
WTP	19950	The plans were later shelved following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill , the worst oil spill in US history . " 	1
WTP	19951	It would seem to me not unreasonable to add one sentence under Domestic policy that says something like , " Obama introduced a proposal to expand areas open to off-shore drilling on March 31 , 2010 [ 45 ] . 	1
WTP	19952	I am OK either way . 	0
WTP	19953	I think the lead is just supposed to be a brief summary of what is in the aritcle and can ' t possibly include everything so we can use our judgement on issues like this . 	1
WTP	19954	That sentence is also in the Beliefs section under subsection " church " . 	0
WTP	19955	I dont have an opinion on whether we keep it in the lead or not . 	0
WTP	19956	Your point may be valid in a few hundred years at the least , when continuous demographic changes will finally have an impact . 	0
WTP	19957	But to say it now is jut ridiculous . 	0
WTP	19958	Multiple users have agreed with me on this point , so I encourage you to expand your horizons a bit â realize there are more specific articles on WP than this one about the First Vision and how Smith was treated in the 1830s â and target your edits about specific details to articles that are about the specific events . 	0

WTP	19964	People had donkeys and horses strung to carts and some who could afford it boats - - travelling a few hundred miles was equivalent to flying from London to Australia back and forth ten times . 	0
WTP	19965	My great granfather used to tell me that a whole village would come to say farewall to people travelling a distance between London and Edinburgh . 	0
WTP	19966	I agree that the Lebanese do get ahead of themselves claiming to be direct descendants of Pheonicians but to be fair , they are the closest to make that claim as do most semites in the region ( regardless of what DNA tests suggest ) . 	0
WTP	19967	It might be notable , and if so , its existance would seem relevant here . 	0
WTP	19968	Works for me . 	0
WTP	19969	While massacres and atrocities were wrought by the crusaders , nowhere does it say that the Church called for or encouraged these massacres but just the opposite - they were appalled and the massacres worked against the goals of the church . 	0
WTP	19970	Not much more than " it exists " is relevant here , so a wikilink would be the way to go . 	1
WTP	19971	There were no criticisms of the Catholic Church in Latin America - every book spoke of the Church taking a stand in every age against the abuses brought upon the people by the Spanish conquistadores and others . 	0
WTP	19972	However , I was surprised myself that what I thought had been the case in these events was actually not what historians thought . 	0
WTP	19973	We have not introduced POV into this article , I intended in every way to show the bad things done by the church throughout the ages in history . 	0
WTP	19974	I agree with Xandar , - As the person who has researched these events extensively using our scholarly works cited , our aritcle represents the view held by scholars . 	1

WTP	19978	Additional interpretation from the guardian link above : " The fact that he compared his desired option - the elimination of " the regime occupying Jerusalem " - with the fall of the Shah ' s regime in Iran makes it crystal clear that he is talking about regime change , not the end of Israel . 	0
WTP	19979	Two of our best scholarly works ( including Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity ) had whole paragraphs , one had half a page discussing how the evils of the Inquisitions have been overblown and they were not as bad as we have been led to believe . 	0
WTP	19980	They even get funding from the government for certain projects ; I find it hard to believe that the current US government would be funding projects connected to PP . 	0

WTP	20011	Even then it ' s bound to be controversial , so the category should be left out . 	1
WTP	20012	Again , you ' re incorrect about how you ' re characterizing my edits , even as your own edits bespeak a lack of understanding of ( or a lack of focus on ) the issue . 	1
WTP	20013	The " an oil rig " wording was not created by my edit , it was created by yours . 	0
WTP	20014	http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barack_Obama&diff=prev&oldid=367249190 My wording had been " exploded a Transocean drilling rig " until Scjessey ' s complaint the section was too long after which I reduced it to " exploded a Transocean rig " , which you changed to " exploded an oil rig " , which , as I ' ve already established , created an entirely new link leading to a disambiguation page . 	0
WTP	20015	As to your point about piping , I think your attitude is a little dismissive and your focus a little myopic . 	0
WTP	20016	I maintain that finding a Deepwater Horizon link within the phrase " a blowout exploded a Transocean drilling rig " is as intuitive as the example of an appropriate link at the Wikipedia : Piped link # Intuitiveness page you link for me as a tutorial , finding " Pontiac ' s Rebellion # Origins " linked within the phrase " war launched in 1763 by a loose confederation of elements of Native American tribes " . 	0
WTP	20017	Now you ' ve changed it to " an explosion destroyed an offshore rig drilling for oil " , with no link at all , again , as if you ' ve got better things to do than properly edit this featured article . 	0
WTP	20018	( If you thought it worth a link before , why not now ? ) 	0
WTP	20019	The rig was not drilling for oil when it was destroyed by the explosion , as your edit makes it sound . 	1
WTP	20020	In fact , the drilling had completely ceased , or the cementing wouldn ' t have commenced 20 hours earlier ; in fact , the rig was basically done there , and about to undergo a routine check before unhitching from the well site and making way to another drilling location . 	0
WTP	20021	I take it you ' ve not caught much C-SPAN these past six or seven weeks ? 	0
WTP	20022	Please continue to accurately relay that the UN said the statement was a clarification and not a " backing down " or however it was characterized in the press . 	0
WTP	20023	Also , the article should note that the IDF itself stated that it had fired at school premises in early reports on the matter , for example here , and your own BBCNews citation states that Israel had first stated that its mortars had caused " carnage _at_ Fakhura school " ( emphasis added ) . 	1

WTP	20036	Getting back to the original point , I think there is a problem in how the sentence infers that these specific bands were reviled by critics , when the point is supposed to be metal as a whole was derided . 	0

WTP	20157	However , Obama never abandoned his religion or said he changed it . 	0
WTP	20158	Part of the problem in real life ( not saying it ' s here ) is that some want to defend Obama so much that they think he abandoned the church and want to wipe it out . 	0
WTP	20159	Obama ' s dispute was with Rev . Wright , not the religion . 	0
WTP	20160	The excuse is that it has been discussed before but what Mr . Saturn says makes sense , that he is United Church of Christ or Protestant . 	0

WTP	20166	Either you are claiming that all phoenicians died out or that there were massive Arab migrations to what is now Lebanon . 	0
WTP	20167	I nominate the paragraph on the Veleia inscriptions for deletion . 	0
WTP	20168	First things they covered were Zeppelin and Sabbath . 	0
WTP	20169	the article is POV , i was denied multiple times to try to balance it , i did so while discussing it on the discussion page . 	0
WTP	20170	The radio programme quoted above is similar to other stuff produced on this page in that it contains no hard facts . 	0
WTP	20171	There is no scandal here in the UK despite many journalists looking for one . 	0
WTP	20172	It is primarily a US scandal , and , despite trawling the internet , no-one has produced evidence of any widespreaad world scandal . 	0
WTP	20173	The " scandal " is not " worldwide . 	1
WTP	20174	I have also noticed that the lead mention has expanded as i have predicted , and it will be cut . 	0
WTP	20175	I ' ve looked at the major Wikipedia RCC articles in other languages and none even discuss this so-called worldwide scandal , let alone have it in the lead . 	0
WTP	20176	This does not a worldwide scandal make , however , however much some people might wish one . 	0

WTP	20182	There are more proofs and evidence suggesting that the content is groundless and untrue manipulated by the current Iran ' s government to justify Ahmadinejad ' s preseidency given that Iranian people have respect and tendency towards educated candidates . 	0
WTP	20183	Thus claiming a ranking system in 1976 , 2 years prior to the revolution , is untrue and groundless . 	0
WTP	20184	Prior to the revolution in Iran in 1978 , each university has its own entrance exam and no ranking system even existed . 	0
WTP	20185	This was the time that the nationwide entrance exam was started as a sample of equity and justice . 	0
WTP	20186	The entrance exam and the ranking system started in 1986-1987 and after the universities re-openned . 	0
WTP	20187	5 ) Iranian universities were closed from 1980 to 1983 due to the post-revolution anarchy . 	0
WTP	20188	4 ) Even if Ahmadinejad had taken the entrance exam in 1990 with almost double population than his time in 1976 , he would have ranked among 150 , 000 and not 400 , 000 ! ! ! 	0
WTP	20189	This is based on capacities as well and the data could confirm the fact that Iranian universities have considerably higher capacities for medical and social sciences than engineering programs . 	0
WTP	20190	The statistics shows that almost always 1 / 5 apply to engineering programs , 2 / 5 social sciences and 2 / 5 medicals . 	0
WTP	20191	It ' s clear they will never admit it , so it has to be highlighted publicly . 	0
WTP	20192	Yeah , there are so many double standards on this article , and this website in general that it would take a massive overhaul of the whole system to clear out the bias of these " editors . " 	0
WTP	20193	Yes , we shouldn ' t base our information on sources that are biased in the other direction . 	0
WTP	20194	On the other hand , a quick glance here shows no mention that there is currently any link between the AGI and PPFA , nor that there has been since 1977 , when " the Alan Guttmacher Institute was incorporated as an independent , not-for-profit organization " . 	0
WTP	20195	There is no vandalism . 	0
WTP	20196	Unless you have some to back up your assertions , this discussion is a dead end . 	0
WTP	20197	" Constant internet debate " is irrelevant here . 	1
WTP	20198	Only reliable secondary sources matter . 	0
WTP	20199	This is heading in an unnecessary and unproductive direction . 	0
WTP	20200	In general , our articles about politicians try to avoid sections devoted to criticism , and avoid criticism generally , because criticism is not really a pertinent biographical fact about people unless it is tied somehow to their life . 	0
WTP	20201	Sometimes a person ' s detractors , or problematic things about them or their actions , are of biographical importance , and they can be included . 	1
WTP	20202	For example , in his book Obama recounted drug use in his youth , something that is a significant part of his life story . 	0
WTP	20203	We don ' t call it a criticism or a controversy , it is simply an event that happened . 	0
WTP	20204	Another thing we avoid is trying to balance articles about people against each other so they are equally or positive or negative . 	1
WTP	20205	It just doesn ' t work like that - we would have to calibrate Obama ' s article against not only other presidents , but all of his political rivals , those of heads of state of other countries , and so on . 	0
WTP	20206	And to what end ? 	0
WTP	20207	It is not our job here on this page to clean up the Bush article or speculate about what makes Bush a controversial figure , but if it is misfocused you are free to go there and try to improve it . 	0

WTP	20213	How exactly is the term " pro-life " not " Catholic " ? 	0
WTP	20214	As far as I know the term is a concise encapsulation of the Church ' s stance on these issues . 	0
WTP	20215	Still , I can see how the article can be improved through something like your suggested edits . 	0
WTP	20216	Strong Oppose - per consistency of every other U . S . city ( except NYC ) 	1
WTP	20217	To stop edit warring leave it out until consensus is reached , but the discussion is somewhat fragmented right now . 	0
WTP	20218	Multiple reverts are never a good idea on this page . 	0
WTP	20219	I don ' t think this content currently can be improved by editing , and the moment it is improved by removal as it isn ' t supported . 	0

WTP	20221	Maybe an article about weapon unloading . 	0
WTP	20222	Maybe in another article , although I can ' t think of one where it would be directly relevant at this point . 	0
WTP	20223	Therefore , it should not be in such a visible article . 	0
WTP	20224	It is clear that anyone not living in Israel would not correctly interpret this picture . 	0
WTP	20225	The patrol is in the territories , so the locals would obviously be settlers , but this is not about " cooperation with settler groups " . 	0
WTP	20226	From what I can tell from the picture , it ' s a joint patrol / weapon unloading by the IDF and local security forces , and this has nothing to do with the " settlement movement " or anything of the sort . 	0
WTP	20227	The above comment shows exactly why this picture shouldn ' t be in this article , as it can be broadly , and incorrectly , interpreted . 	1
WTP	20228	The object of a " theory " is to enduce debate , which in turn stimulates research and which in return bears fruit in the form of a " fact " , creativity is more important that knowledge ( " Einstein " ) . 	0
WTP	20229	Youre a braver man than I am , Roland , for signing with your name to what you just said . 	0
WTP	20230	I believe that aptitude would go further in real life , this write fest has certainly " evolved " into a one hell of a discussion , 	0
WTP	20231	Catholic Charities is one of the largest charities in the United States , I think it is in the top ten - per a Forbes article referenced on its wikipedia page . 	0
WTP	20232	I would also like to point out that the good things the church does - its current missions , orphanages , schools , universities , Catholic Charities and Catholic Releif Services only get passing mention with no elaboration on the vast number - millions of people helped by the church currently each year . 	0

WTP	20234	While the LGBT population of San Francisco is certainly one of its most internationally recognizable elements , it is one aspect of the many things that are recognizable about San Francisco and should probably be included in the lead , I would prefer that all the items listed there maintain a parallel structure . 	0
WTP	20235	The final paragraph in the lead does not need to have an overly technical representation of the gay and lesbian population of San Francisco . 	1
WTP	20236	The section has been treated no differently than any other paragraph that has contained criticism of the church . 	0
WTP	20237	Entropy1 , don ' t let me discourage you from trying to improve this article , but in this case I think you are trying to introduce conclusions that are not supported by mainstream scholars , including Mormon mainstream historians like Richard Bushman . 	0
WTP	20238	But the proposed material here , such as the newspaper articles , is not appropriate in this article . 	1
WTP	20239	The First Vision is a very important part of post-1900 Mormonism . 	0
WTP	20240	if the tone of my edits was not neutral ( this is how X is called by Y ) , or if my attempt to clarify the reasoning of ( X ) why it / they use this name were offending , then that should be discussed on this page or modified accordingly in the article ! 	0
WTP	20241	but it was removed and the removal reasoning was not clarified here and the discussion was left open because chose not to take part of the discussion ! 	0
WTP	20242	in that sense the article is not balanced , although i would say that as far as i can see , it does not introduce false information , but it defiantly shuts off a whole perspective of it ! 	1
WTP	20243	I agree . 	0
WTP	20244	It requires that all majority - and significant-minority views be presented fairly , in a disinterested tone , and in rough proportion to their prevalence within the source material . " , the last post in the discussion ( before my responses regarding the discussion ) was by Sean . hoyland , i confirmed to the constructive input that shows that no one but i agrees that the term IOF should be used in the intro , it is clear that this term is not welcomed by some editors , and seems offensive to some , never the less , it still represents a major perspective that the article is completely ignoring ! 	0
WTP	20245	regardless whether we agree on it or not ! 	0
WTP	20246	Can you please clarify how i am vandalizing the article ? 	0
WTP	20247	but lets not get drifted off the topic here , i will quote " The neutral point of view is a means of dealing with conflicting perspectives on a topic as evidenced by reliable sources . 	0
WTP	20248	Though I deeply respect my former professor Anderson , I don ' t think we can make much use of his BYU Studies article in Wikipedia , given that no non-Mormon scholar agrees with the underlying conclusion of his article . 	1
WTP	20249	frankly I ' m offended by you calling my edits vandalism ! 	0
WTP	20250	but i would rather keep the discussion revolving around the core issue of this discussion . 	0
WTP	20251	Thus , Obama ' s and most other Democrats pages stay clean . 	0
WTP	20252	They simply put you , me or anybody else who tries for a legitimate edit , through what is obviously a run-around , until we give up . 	0
WTP	20253	They are clearly biased . 	0
