ClaimBuster	24928	I have ordered an investigation.	1
ClaimBuster	28115	In the meantime, I think it's important to have what's called Immediate Helping Hand, which is direct money to states so that seniors, poor seniors, don't have to choose between food and medicine.	0
ClaimBuster	26400	Because of paperwork and regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	14031	I suggest to you that the core problem -- 1 country spent $400 million lobbying in 1988, our country.	1
ClaimBuster	21886	The programs will be good because the elected officials will be listening to -- I said the other night I was all ears and I would listen to any good idea.	0
ClaimBuster	15691	There's nothing the matter with that.	0
ClaimBuster	352	Maybe we need to do a better job in mental clinics to help them.	0
ClaimBuster	8524	We should support uh - the laws which the United States has passed in order to protect us from uh - those who would destroy us from within.	0
ClaimBuster	17491	I don't think so, and I think it's going in exactly the wrong direction.	0
ClaimBuster	33390	But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.	1
ClaimBuster	33736	Well, first, let me say, number one, when I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it.	1
ClaimBuster	30232	It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	8392	I think we're going to have to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	32779	And I know there's a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	5566	I want Joe the plumber to spread that wealth around.	0
ClaimBuster	24381	And I'm not going to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	24361	I would say if you want to continue as Most Favored Nation status for your government owned industries as well as your private ones, observe human rights in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	11365	And I'm asking the American people to give me another opportunity and I'll rest on my record, but I'll also tell you, when times are tough, we need a steady hand at the tiller and the great honor of my life was to always put my country first.	0
ClaimBuster	18039	I'm proud that important military figures who are supporting me in this race: former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili; just yesterday, General Eisenhower's son, General John Eisenhower, endorsed me; General Admiral William Crown; General Tony McBeak, who ran the Air Force war so effectively for his father -- all believe I would make a stronger commander in chief.	1
ClaimBuster	17330	How would it be resolved when those disputes occur?	0
ClaimBuster	16287	It now looks, because of steady negotiation, that we may have an agreement that will remove the Cubans from Angola.	0
ClaimBuster	21011	And now they had ingenuity eight years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	24448	There's been a lot of talk about family values in this campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	8740	I agree with what I think is the major premise of your question, sir, that we are going to have to create a new conservation ethic in the minds of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	20743	I'll give you a couple of examples.	0
ClaimBuster	2722	All those things are designed to make sure that the American people, their genius, their grit, their determination, is -- is channeled and -- and they have an opportunity to succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	22466	And for a guy that started out with everything he owned in the trunk of his car --	0
ClaimBuster	2914	I would restore the concept of the fireside chat, which was an integral part of the administration of Franklin Roosevelt.	1
ClaimBuster	23781	I vowed to the American people after that fateful day of September the 11th that we would not rest nor tire until we're safe.	1
ClaimBuster	26428	We have a good, stable economic policy.	0
ClaimBuster	17874	And then you add to that food and wardrobe, and all the other things, and you only have a small portion going for weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	25584	This evening we talked about national strength.	1
ClaimBuster	20366	If you're a family of four in Massachusetts, making $50,000, you get a 50% cut in the federal income taxes you pay.	1
ClaimBuster	23369	I was -- broke with my party in 1985, one of the first three Democrats to fight for a balanced budget when it was heresy.	1
ClaimBuster	16401	And I ask you to consider the experience I have had in working with a President who has revolutionized the situation around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	3309	This is uh - what the American people want.	0
ClaimBuster	3267	The United States must and will maintain complete access to the Panama Canal.	0
ClaimBuster	21141	If we don't trust younger workers to manage some of their own money with the Social Security surplus, to grow from $1 trillion to $3 trillion, it will be impossible to bridge the gap without it.	0
ClaimBuster	18497	She's a fantastic lady I met in Charlotte, North Carolina.	1
ClaimBuster	23856	You know, my wife, Hillary, gave me a book about a year ago in which the author defined insanity as just doing the same old thing over and over again and expecting a different result.	1
ClaimBuster	11181	And I'm going to act responsibly, as I have acted responsibly throughout my military career and throughout my career in the United States Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	17022	Another issue in this campaign, Governor Carter has endorsed the Democratic platform, which calls for more spending, bigger deficits, more inflation or mare taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	18110	Their hope is that we grow weary and we leave.	0
ClaimBuster	22694	Those are the words of two Republicans, respected, both on the Foreign Relations Committee.	0
ClaimBuster	16761	Even the proponents of it admitted that no more than four hundred thousand jobs would be uh - made available.	1
ClaimBuster	1476	That is a very serious indictment of this administration.	0
ClaimBuster	19683	Saddam Hussein is under a U.N. resolution not to threaten his neighbors or threaten his own, repress his own citizens.	1
ClaimBuster	19444	We just have a different approach.	0
ClaimBuster	26918	I congratulate him on -- on taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in al-Qaeda.	1
ClaimBuster	34391	We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.	0
ClaimBuster	12612	That's what should concern us, not the history of ten, or fifteen, or twenty years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	10145	But let me mention another thing.	0
ClaimBuster	18085	The facts are that he was systematically deceiving the inspectors.	1
ClaimBuster	11560	And one of the reasons I felt so strongly that the United States needed to participate was because of our relations with NATO, and NATO is going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	12798	If we fail, it's been a great serious failure for everyone - for the human race.	0
ClaimBuster	27688	Well I believe we should use any and all means necessary to take out people who pose a threat to us and our friends around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	29820	And that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know.	0
ClaimBuster	34359	I want to invest in your family.	0
ClaimBuster	3724	Well, look, I want to make sure that we are investing in energy in order to free ourselves from the dependence on foreign oil.	0
ClaimBuster	26486	That's just one tiny example.	0
ClaimBuster	23174	You should have shown up on the floor in the Senate and voted for it then.	0
ClaimBuster	26200	When you don't have any ideas, I guess you say the other person's ideas are old.	0
ClaimBuster	20311	Now here is the contrast.	0
ClaimBuster	346	I see the funding that is required, and I hope the Congress will fully fund this bill.	0
ClaimBuster	12138	I thought that's exactly what he and Mrs. Clinton and them fought for in 1993 was a government-run health care system.	1
ClaimBuster	11410	The goals ought to be an education system that leaves no child behind, Medicare for our seniors, a Social Security system that's safe and secure, foreign policy that's in our nation's interest, and a strong military, and then bring people together to achieve those goals.	0
ClaimBuster	912	I think it's going to require a combination of supply management and reasonable price supports to make sure that our farmers get a decent price and I think it also is going to require an administration that understand that there are tremendous opportunities out there for the development of new uses for agricultural products, new uses which can help us to clean up our environment at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	15639	The fact of the matter is that the next president of the United States is going to have to go to the White House seriously, he is going to have to work with the Congress seriously he can't turn to the Congress and blame them for the fact that we don't have a balanced budget and that we have billions and billions of dollars in red ink.	0
ClaimBuster	2389	If they had a pre-existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all.	0
ClaimBuster	2719	The auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride, that they're helping to build America.	1
ClaimBuster	6048	We've got to do both, and that's exactly what my plan does.	1
ClaimBuster	645	We've got to move ahead with the strategic arms negotiation process, with the comprehensive test ban treaty and with negotiations leading to conventional force reduction in Europe with deeper cuts on the Soviet side and Senator Bentsen and I will pursue that policy.	0
ClaimBuster	29058	I don't think the surplus exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the federal government, I think it exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	140	That happens to be a fact.	1
ClaimBuster	15597	We can do all of those things, and at the same time build a future in which we are standing on a good strong fiscal foundation.	0
ClaimBuster	27926	I've met some of those people.	1
ClaimBuster	13373	I will issue a white paper after this broadcast, quoting exactly what he said on compulsory arbitration, for example, and the record will show that I have been correct.	0
ClaimBuster	8610	Thirdly, I think the question before the American people is: as they look at this country and as they look at the world around them, the goals are the same for all Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	26234	And that's why I must say I agree with General Colin Powell that we're not there yet.	0
ClaimBuster	16830	This costs our uh - government about uh - $1.4 billion a year.	1
ClaimBuster	25647	I was just going to -- --	0
ClaimBuster	25	We have to change this whole culture.	0
ClaimBuster	3814	And we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat.	0
ClaimBuster	23327	You can run, but you can't hide.	0
ClaimBuster	1061	I regret the things in my own long campaign that have been mistaken, but I'm trying to do away with those the last ten days.	0
ClaimBuster	23845	A lot of them are thrown out because of all the scandals.	0
ClaimBuster	8326	The farmer produced these surpluses because the government asked him to through legislation during the war.	1
ClaimBuster	11082	That requires a cool hand at the tiller.	0
ClaimBuster	1517	We have reduced the number of people in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines from three million, one hundred - three million, five hundred thousand to two mil- lion one hundred thousand.	1
ClaimBuster	23397	The president's done nothing to try to fix it.	1
ClaimBuster	10037	You know that I mean what I say.	0
ClaimBuster	10792	But I think it's important to understand, we're not going to solve Social Security and Medicare unless we understand the rest of our tax policies.	0
ClaimBuster	32427	I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example.	0
ClaimBuster	26479	I just told you about this manufacturing job loss which is going to increase.	1
ClaimBuster	23943	You have questioned my patriotism.	0
ClaimBuster	8681	I believe that inflation today is caused by government simply spending more than government takes in, at the same time that government has imposed upon business and industry, from the shopkeeper on the corner to the biggest industrial plant in America, countless harassing regulations and punitive taxes that have reduced productivity at the same time they have increased the cost of production.	0
ClaimBuster	16778	Well, that bill has not yet come down to the Oval Office, so I am not in a position to make any judgment on it tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	6042	So I don't -- I don't think there's any doubt that Senator Obama wants to restrict trade and he wants to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	18588	He is the leader of that country.	1
ClaimBuster	8802	As an aid to enlistment.	0
ClaimBuster	3908	There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there.	0
ClaimBuster	15452	And if you answer all of those questions yes, why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for.	0
ClaimBuster	11821	And so we ought to do everything we can to end racial profiling.	0
ClaimBuster	18044	The president relied on Afghan warlords and he outsourced that job too.	1
ClaimBuster	12085	So in my state we toughen up the juvenile justice laws.	1
ClaimBuster	29298	When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test.	1
ClaimBuster	3758	An issue I have been involved in for many, many years and I'm proud of the work of the work that I've done there along with Senator Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	13193	And incidentally, Senator Johnson was among those who rejected that position - voted with the seventy against the twelve.	1
ClaimBuster	25625	It was to go into a time capsule and would be read in 100 years when that time capsule was opened.	1
ClaimBuster	21845	Keep the government as far out of it as possible, make insurance available to the poorest of the poor, through vouchers, next range in the income bracket, through tax credits, and get on about the business of pooling insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	2602	But the federal government also can play a very important role.	0
ClaimBuster	24338	And so, we've got a good military.	0
ClaimBuster	13638	We have spent their money.	1
ClaimBuster	8863	We've got thousands and thousands of homes owned by government boarded up, being vandalized, that have been taken in mortgage foreclosures.	1
ClaimBuster	1511	He tends to distort on a number of occasions.	0
ClaimBuster	28572	Let's make our schools safe, let's make our neighborhoods safe.	0
ClaimBuster	6979	You just heard the president say that young people ought to be able to take money out of Social Security and put it in their own accounts.	1
ClaimBuster	3636	You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes.	0
ClaimBuster	12244	He's for letting the oil companies into the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.	1
ClaimBuster	21626	This is fact slinging -- a bill earlier this year.	0
ClaimBuster	620	These are the-my answer is do not make these unilateral cuts, and everybody now realizes that peace through strength works, and so this is where I have a big difference.	0
ClaimBuster	13420	And I believe when the average hour for many farmers' wage is about fifty cents an hour, he should do better.	0
ClaimBuster	11703	We've got to rebuild our military.	0
ClaimBuster	19932	Thank goodness we had a Republican Congress there.	1
ClaimBuster	7325	And affirmative action is not just something that applies to people of color.	0
ClaimBuster	15280	If it is a well-known fact that I opposed air pollution laws in California, the only thing I can possibly think of is that the President must be suggesting the law that the Federal Government tried to impose on the State of California - not a law, but regulations - that would have made it impossible to drive an automobile within the city limits of any California city, or to have a place to put it if you did drive it against their regulations.	1
ClaimBuster	26577	And talk about the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	28750	The HMOs are against the patient's rights bill, the Dingle-Norwood bill that I support, and that Gov.	1
ClaimBuster	34055	The FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails.	1
ClaimBuster	2199	AARP thinks that the -- the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	10636	This is the most liberal big-spending record in the United States Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	32844	You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system.	1
ClaimBuster	7597	There also isn't any question but that the free people of Cuba - the people who want to be free - are going to be supported and that they will attain their freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	21036	We need somebody to simplify the code, to be fair, to continue prosperity by sharing some of the surplus with the people who pay the bills, particularly those at the bottom end of the economic ladder.	0
ClaimBuster	11577	Now, have I got that wrong?	0
ClaimBuster	18185	And long before President Bush and I get a tax cut -- and that's who gets it -- long before we do, I'm going to invest in homeland security and I'm going to make sure we're not cutting COPS programs in America and we're fully staffed in our firehouses and that we protect the nuclear and chemical plants.	1
ClaimBuster	5900	And that's really what this campaign is going to be about.	0
ClaimBuster	11105	And that's why I think it's so important for us to reverse course, because that's the central front on terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	20591	But make no mistake about it, we should do everything we can to see that the will of the Serbian people expressed in this extraordinary election is done.	0
ClaimBuster	3897	I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	22427	Now, let me pose this question to America.	0
ClaimBuster	30158	Just so you put it out.	0
ClaimBuster	7980	Now, there are people who go to bed hungry in the United States - far less, incidentally, than used to go to bed hungry when we came into power at the end of the Truman Administration.	0
ClaimBuster	33633	We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out.	0
ClaimBuster	30227	That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted.	0
ClaimBuster	23702	I ask each of you just to look into your hearts, look into your guts.	0
ClaimBuster	25224	Now, on arms control, we're completing 4 years.	1
ClaimBuster	12299	I think, for example, take -- when they took 40 million acres of land out of circulation without consulting local officials, I thought that was --	0
ClaimBuster	23131	And that's saying something in that bunch.	0
ClaimBuster	18671	He was hoping to turn a blind eye.	0
ClaimBuster	9552	Nobody who's looked at it that's serious, actually believes it adds up.	0
ClaimBuster	23654	Secondly, with respect to parental notification, I'm not going to require a 16-or 17-year-old kid who's been raped by her father and who's pregnant to have to notify her father.	0
ClaimBuster	9646	"He said, ""I'll get back to you."""	1
ClaimBuster	914	I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers.	0
ClaimBuster	25632	We know nothing about them.	1
ClaimBuster	5514	And I pushed for some core principles: making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if they're putting money up.	1
ClaimBuster	10126	And so what I'm trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally.	0
ClaimBuster	9801	He said he would have by now put forward a plan to reform Medicare and Social Security, because he pointed out they're on the road to bankruptcy.	1
ClaimBuster	13240	And I can only say that I'm very proud that President Eisenhower restored dignity and decency and, frankly, good language to the conduct of the presidency of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	16773	And by holding the lid on federal spending we have been able to do an- a good job, an affirmative job in inflation and as a result have added to the jobs in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	1052	And I think this is uh - uh - part of uh - of just being a human being.	0
ClaimBuster	27183	Our association and connection with our allies is essential to America's strength.	0
ClaimBuster	32079	And she's going after fact after fact, and she's lying again, because she said she -- you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine.	1
ClaimBuster	339	These are people that care, that are trying to give of themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	19740	Now maybe it's better just to get together and sit down and talk.	0
ClaimBuster	12909	He repeated it again in a television debate that we had.	1
ClaimBuster	27538	We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	28983	One of my promises is going to be Social Security reform, and you bet, we need to take a trillion dollars out of that $2.4 trillion surplus.	1
ClaimBuster	9768	And those that I haven't been able to keep, it's not for lack of trying and we're going to get it done in a second term.	0
ClaimBuster	1126	There are some who allege, I can't prove it true or untrue, that uh - such a statement uh - in effect invited the North Koreans to invade South Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	21303	That's right at the top of my agenda.	0
ClaimBuster	22811	"I remember going down to the basement of the White House the day we committed our troops as last resort, looking at Tommy Franks and the generals on the ground, asking them, ""Do we have the right plan with the right troop level?"""	1
ClaimBuster	13127	I support it and the Pescadores Island.	0
ClaimBuster	19868	That's one of the big reasons I vetoed it.	1
ClaimBuster	25526	What happens in South Africa, where, for example, the Nobel Prize winner, 2 days ago, said this administration is seen as working with the oppressive government of South Africa.	1
ClaimBuster	18504	I understand that we must find Al Qaida wherever they hide.	0
ClaimBuster	2130	It's going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker -- Democratic Speaker Tip O'Neill.	0
ClaimBuster	27599	And it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him.	0
ClaimBuster	20773	They make $51,000 combined income, they pay about $3500 in taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	20463	I brought this up recently with Vincent Fox the newly elected president in Mexico, he's a man I know from Mexico.	1
ClaimBuster	24070	"I think ""punish"" is the wrong word."	0
ClaimBuster	11239	And some say that that's what Putin intended in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	26829	We're going to have a good economic package.	0
ClaimBuster	4077	I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization.	0
ClaimBuster	2644	You put $90 billion into -- into green jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	13809	The misery index -- unemployment and inflation added together -- it was invented by the Democrats -- went right through the roof.	1
ClaimBuster	30299	This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history.	0
ClaimBuster	18936	Weapons of mass destruction, nuclear proliferation.	0
ClaimBuster	27690	But let me also note that as I said earlier, we're going to have to do more than just going after leaders and -- and killing bad guys, important as that is.	0
ClaimBuster	2523	And I'm going to work together with Congress to say, OK, what -- what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance?	0
ClaimBuster	8275	Uh - I have made other recommendations after each of the other trips; for example, after my trip abroad to Hungary I made some recommendations with regard to the Hungarian refugee situation which were adopted, not only by the President but some of them were enacted into law by the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	14048	But if I found somebody that had a conflict of interest that would try to illegally do something as a foreign -- registered lobby, the laws cover this.	1
ClaimBuster	4192	It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship.	0
ClaimBuster	307	And that's all I'm trying to do, is put it in focus.	0
ClaimBuster	8798	I believe the answer lies in just recognizing human nature and how we make everything else work in this country, when we want it to work.	0
ClaimBuster	26579	If we grow the economy it's going to help Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	19501	You add all the states that've used the instant check and how many weapons they keep, kept out of the hands of criminals.	0
ClaimBuster	7488	They surely don't let me do that.	0
ClaimBuster	8133	I'm not satisfied when we are failing to develop the natural resources of the United States to the fullest.	0
ClaimBuster	2944	And let me cite several examples.	0
ClaimBuster	12078	But I don't think that we can ignore the role played by guns.	0
ClaimBuster	10348	I went to the Olympics when they were in trouble to try and get them on track.	1
ClaimBuster	25269	When Mr. Nitze, a good negotiator, returned, he was rebuked, and his boss was fired.	1
ClaimBuster	28975	(LAUGHTER) I said I'd do four things; tort reform, education reform, welfare reform and juvenile justice reform.	1
ClaimBuster	1021	With the fiscal program that I have, and if you look at the projections, it shows that we will reduce unemployment, that we will continue to win the battle against inflation, and at the same time give the kind of quality of life that I believe is possible in America.	0
ClaimBuster	26181	In our economic plan, the $500 child credit can be used for young people, rolled over and over and over, you, of course not this age, but if you have a child two years old, 7 percent interest would be worth about $18,000 by the time that child was ready for college.	1
ClaimBuster	20143	I want to say in the beginning that I am profoundly grateful for the chance that you have given me to serve as president for the last four years.	1
ClaimBuster	12021	I think the only people that are going to show up to register or get a license -- I guess licensing like a driver's license for a gun, the only people that are going to show up are law-abiding citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	3079	We comprise about 30 percent of the world's economic trade power influence.	1
ClaimBuster	848	And he'll do very well when we get into the debates.	0
ClaimBuster	10209	But this will make a difference in terms of whether or not we can move this economy forward for these young people...	0
ClaimBuster	6832	These are accounts that allow somebody to buy a low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax-free savings.	1
ClaimBuster	10341	I'm a guy who wants to help with the experience I have, the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	19465	If we're going to protect American children and American families and people who live as prisoners in their own home, we've got to stop guns from being dumped on the street.	0
ClaimBuster	1082	Now that was gone into by two congressional committees, and following that investigation, both committees overwhelmingly approved me, and the House and the Senate did likewise.	1
ClaimBuster	22493	It's time to put the American people first, to invest and grow this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	21747	And at that point, we can pick from a variety of plans and develop new plans.	0
ClaimBuster	12081	And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands.	0
ClaimBuster	33691	That is not going to work.	0
ClaimBuster	29368	And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.	1
ClaimBuster	19673	I think there's enough -- we're even looking at our tax cut proposal, our economic package.	0
ClaimBuster	13597	I propose an American version of what works in other countries -- I think we can do it better: invest and grow.	0
ClaimBuster	17807	Well, we've just finished almost the whole debate.	0
ClaimBuster	16215	You did everything you could to kill the Clean Water Act	1
ClaimBuster	22586	I can -- and thanks, Washington U. as well.	0
ClaimBuster	26819	I will just say my time is running out here.	0
ClaimBuster	32169	And then we would have to start all over again.	0
ClaimBuster	12056	You can't carry a gun into a school.	0
ClaimBuster	19492	Well, the President doesn't have it quite right.	0
ClaimBuster	33573	I think it makes the world safer and, frankly, it makes the United States safer.	0
ClaimBuster	15460	I know that the economic program that I have proposed for this nation in the next few years can resolve many of the problems that trouble us today.	0
ClaimBuster	27721	Well, I think it will continue to be terrorist networks.	0
ClaimBuster	28449	You can't worry about polls or focus groups.	0
ClaimBuster	5790	That's the stuff that campaigns should be made of.	0
ClaimBuster	8973	But we did factor in our own ideas with regard to increases in the projected military spending that we believe would, over a period of time, do what is necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	17757	It was once called voodoo economics.	1
ClaimBuster	6011	We can offshore drill now.	1
ClaimBuster	27212	In the 2000 debates, there was no mention of terrorism, for instance.	1
ClaimBuster	4280	That was the key legislation at the time and put us on the road to eliminating this issue of nuclear waste and the nuclear fuel that has to be taken care of.	0
ClaimBuster	8535	We uphold the standards of conduct which they would never follow.	0
ClaimBuster	4341	We are going to need more cooperation with our allies.	0
ClaimBuster	23229	Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, others, knew how to lead.	0
ClaimBuster	29289	And I have -- well, not quite that long.	0
ClaimBuster	21325	And if indeed all the jobs were going to move south because there are lower wages, there are lower wages now and they haven't done that.	1
ClaimBuster	15813	You did, Ann heard of him.	0
ClaimBuster	21071	I'm also opposed to a plan that diverts 1 out of every $6 away from the Social Security Trust Fund.	1
ClaimBuster	14077	Why, I had a great response to that.	1
ClaimBuster	7763	Nineteen fifty-three we tried to put an appropriation of five billion dollars for our defenses.	1
ClaimBuster	28407	Now, I doubt anybody here makes more than $330,000 a year.	0
ClaimBuster	16082	Now there are some things we can do to help people who currently do get entitlements to get off public assistance.	0
ClaimBuster	17795	And none of these things happened.	1
ClaimBuster	21698	Once you automate your records, then you don't have to have a waiting period, but at least you can check.	0
ClaimBuster	7649	My intentions in the field of civil rights have been spelled out in the Republican platform.	1
ClaimBuster	26794	All the people who may still be watching or viewing.	0
ClaimBuster	24297	It's a very unstable situation.	0
ClaimBuster	23225	This is the biggest turnaround in the history of the country.	1
ClaimBuster	33872	We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI.	1
ClaimBuster	31996	He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women.	1
ClaimBuster	18414	You can't tell me that on the day that we went into that war and it started -- it was principally the United States, the America and Great Britain and one or two others.	0
ClaimBuster	26019	After this year is over, we'll resolve it just as we did with Social Security in `83.	1
ClaimBuster	26801	We should have our differences.	0
ClaimBuster	8219	But on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new.	0
ClaimBuster	27694	You look at the record of the last four years and say is Iran closer to a bomb?	0
ClaimBuster	24220	We're going to have a new Congress, and we're going to say to them, you've listened to the voters the way we have.	0
ClaimBuster	24544	That crime bill is going to be one of my highest priorities next January if I become president.	0
ClaimBuster	21308	To those of you in the audience who are business people: pretty simple.	0
ClaimBuster	3171	And with our economy in such terrible disarray and getting worse by the month.	0
ClaimBuster	6172	Republicans wanted to have just a majority vote to confirm a judge and the Democrats were blocking in an unprecedented fashion.	1
ClaimBuster	31945	That's why -- to go back to your question -- I want to send a message -- we all should -- to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.	0
ClaimBuster	13293	I do not suggest in any way, nor have I ever, that that indicates that Mr. Nixon has the slightest sympathy, involvement, or in any way imply any inferences in regard to the Ku Klux Klan.	0
ClaimBuster	28746	I wish that he would consider changing his mind on that.	0
ClaimBuster	11508	I do think this, though.	0
ClaimBuster	11472	I think that we also have to keep a weather eye toward Saddam Hussein because he is taking advantage of this situation to once again make threats, and he needs to understand that he's not only dealing with Israel, he is dealing -- he's dealing with us if he is making the kind of threats that he's talking about there.	0
ClaimBuster	7998	And we ought to try to meet the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	19150	The President trusts the government.	0
ClaimBuster	20553	It's very clear to me.	0
ClaimBuster	22128	Well, it's cost-effective to help Russia succeed in its revolution; it's pennies on the dollar compared to going back to the Cold War.	1
ClaimBuster	20647	Morale in today's military is too low.	0
ClaimBuster	16953	Uh the Federal Reserve Board indicated that the supply of money would be held between four to four and a half and seven and seven and a half.	1
ClaimBuster	18212	The president just said the FBI had changed its culture.	0
ClaimBuster	14302	I mean, this is a little defensive on your part, Susan, to be honest with you.	0
ClaimBuster	20778	There is a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	5741	But it's very clear that I have disagreed with the Bush administration.	1
ClaimBuster	6720	When they voted -- when they proposed reducing taxes, you voted against it 126 times.	1
ClaimBuster	18601	But I think the president, again, still hasn't shown how he's going to go about it the right way.	0
ClaimBuster	2509	The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we've got to make choices.	0
ClaimBuster	34002	You know what she should have done?	0
ClaimBuster	27093	Then it went to the Russians and said, let's see if you can do something.	1
ClaimBuster	29816	But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists.	0
ClaimBuster	14262	My favorite bumper sticker, though, is: Annoy the Media.	1
ClaimBuster	2161	But on Medicare, for current retirees, he's cutting $716 billion from the program.	1
ClaimBuster	13921	Yes, it'll create bubble jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	1297	Uh - FHA, which used to be a very responsible agency, uh - that everyone looked to to help own a home, lost six million dollars last year.	1
ClaimBuster	26166	This is about, somebody said earlier, one of the first questions, we're together.	1
ClaimBuster	15689	That's the kind of leadership I want to provide.	0
ClaimBuster	17427	I found that was rather difficult to do.	0
ClaimBuster	14747	Absolutely we can win, because it's your country.	0
ClaimBuster	31934	And he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is.	1
ClaimBuster	25365	Now, with regard to having to say whether we would try to survive in the event of a nuclear war, of course we would.	0
ClaimBuster	28888	Government shouldn't be a heavy hand.	0
ClaimBuster	21147	The man loves his family a lot, and I appreciate that, because I love my family.	1
ClaimBuster	20886	You must say that if you receive money you must show us whether or not children are learning to read and write and add and subtract.	0
ClaimBuster	15198	My point I have made already, Mr. President, with regard to negotiating: it does not call for nuclear superiority on the part of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	29107	I want us to invest in your future.	0
ClaimBuster	29936	But it can't be dismissed that easily.	0
ClaimBuster	1806	Well, but -- but virtually -- virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate.	0
ClaimBuster	8148	The argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty-five years.	0
ClaimBuster	20731	Almost half of all the tax cut benefits, as I said under Governor Bush's plan, go to the wealthiest 1%.	1
ClaimBuster	19287	We'd like to have your support.	0
ClaimBuster	10543	If they can't get a loan, that means that they can't make payroll.	0
ClaimBuster	20317	I want all seniors to have prescription drugs in Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	29275	So I will tell you this.	0
ClaimBuster	5789	And there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate like we're having tonight about health care, about energy policy, about tax policy.	1
ClaimBuster	30344	We cannot be the policemen of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	25748	They see ethical problems in the Whitehouse today.	0
ClaimBuster	6852	But the president and his friends took it out in the House, and now you don't have that right.	1
ClaimBuster	25831	We still need to cover about 20million people and a lot of children.	1
ClaimBuster	21807	We spend 30% more of our income than any nation on earth on health care, and yet we insure fewer people.	1
ClaimBuster	3423	Well, thank you very much, Jim, and thanks to the commission and the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, for hosting us tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	2701	That's how we went after Al Qaida and bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	5777	And, Senator Obama, when he said -- and he signed a piece of paper that said he would take public financing for his campaign if I did -- that was back when he was a long-shot candidate -- you didn't keep your word.	1
ClaimBuster	31909	Nobody has more respect for women than I do.	0
ClaimBuster	8537	And in that connection I again would say that while Senator Kennedy says we are for the status quo, I do believe that he uh - would agree that I am just as sincere in believing that my proposals for federal aid to education, my proposals for health care are just as sincerely held as his.	0
ClaimBuster	17656	But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans.	1
ClaimBuster	13967	Mr. Bush says it's a hunky-dory deal.	1
ClaimBuster	19373	Cocaine is up 141 percent -- marijuana, cocaine up 166 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	29848	But it is important that we learn about what has been effective.	0
ClaimBuster	21497	When Mr. Quayle said that all the networks said, that's not true.	0
ClaimBuster	15428	In each case, I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country.	0
ClaimBuster	28837	Affirmative action means that you take extra steps to acknowledge the history of discrimination and injustice and prejudice and bring all people into the American dream because it helps everybody, not just those who are directly benefitting.	0
ClaimBuster	10033	I said that we'd go after al-Qaeda and bin Laden, we have.	1
ClaimBuster	2612	You know, this is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices.	1
ClaimBuster	5540	Joe, I want to tell you, I'll not only help you buy that business that you worked your whole life for and be able -- and I'll keep your taxes low and I'll provide available and affordable health care for you and your employees.	0
ClaimBuster	4396	And I'll take care of them.	0
ClaimBuster	15641	But more than that, to do the kind of job that I'm elected to do, will do it with as much good humor as I can, but at the same time will do it in a way which will achieve the goals we want for ourselves and our people.	0
ClaimBuster	24824	I'd like to thank all the folks around America that no one ever knows about -- the woman that was holding the AIDS baby she adopted in Cedar Rapids, Iowa who asked me to do something more for adoption; the woman who stopped along the road in Wisconsin and wept because her husband had lost his job after 27 years; all the people who are having a tough time and the people who are winning but who know how desperately we need to change.	1
ClaimBuster	1877	He's in the electronics business in -- in St. Louis.	1
ClaimBuster	30229	No, they were taunting us.	0
ClaimBuster	6945	Senators and congressmen have a wide choice.	0
ClaimBuster	6745	It basically protected states from the action of one state to another.	0
ClaimBuster	33327	We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty.	0
ClaimBuster	8582	Where we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	4275	So I want to say that, with the Nunn-Lugar thing...	0
ClaimBuster	28961	"Reminds me of the line from the movie, ""Show me the money."""	0
ClaimBuster	33949	I'm very proud of that.	0
ClaimBuster	18865	I don't think that's my job or my business.	0
ClaimBuster	14362	For most of my time as governor a woman was my chief of staff.	1
ClaimBuster	19835	We've worked hard to expand public school choice in my balanced budget bill.	0
ClaimBuster	33908	The State Department has said that.	1
ClaimBuster	13327	I do not believe we should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure.	0
ClaimBuster	9515	There are 3.5 million more women living in poverty today than when the president took office.	1
ClaimBuster	30333	... to be given any opportunities at all.	0
ClaimBuster	8162	I want us to recapture that image.	0
ClaimBuster	2696	That's how we cut taxes for middle- class families and small businesses.	0
ClaimBuster	25637	They will know whether we used those weapons or not.	0
ClaimBuster	25512	And I think that we've had enough of a record of letting -- under the guise of revolution -- someone that we thought was a little more right than we would be, letting that person go, and then winding up with totalitarianism, pure and simple, as the alternative.	0
ClaimBuster	18585	Everybody knows it's hard work, because there's a determined enemy that's trying to defeat us.	0
ClaimBuster	20559	I have a record of appointing judges in the State of Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	27765	It holds down the prices of their goods.	1
ClaimBuster	17	I think for a while as a nation we condoned those things we should have condemned.	0
ClaimBuster	12592	I talked to the American Ambassador there.	1
ClaimBuster	4356	The consequences of defeat, which would result from his plan of withdrawal and according to date certain, regardless of conditions, according to our military leaders, according to every expert, would lead to defeat -- possible defeat, loss of all the fragile sacrifice that we've made of American blood and treasure, which grieves us all.	0
ClaimBuster	6212	Let me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue.	0
ClaimBuster	1378	And, in addition to that put forward a proposal that was adopted and used throughout my own term of office of selection of - for all judges and district attorneys or prosecuting attorneys, on the basis of merit.	1
ClaimBuster	5939	I think that, obviously, she's a capable politician who has, I think, excited the -- a base in the Republican Party.	0
ClaimBuster	26837	First thing I want to say is thank you for giving me the chance to be president.	0
ClaimBuster	19582	I have proposed a lot of new investments to improve the quality of life for our soldiers, for our men and women in uniform, for their families, for their training.	1
ClaimBuster	29448	And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	2829	Let me tell you this straight from the shoulder.	0
ClaimBuster	10447	It means that we are cracking down on CEOs and making sure that they're not getting bonuses or golden parachutes as a consequence of this package.	0
ClaimBuster	24844	We had to stand up against a tyrant.	0
ClaimBuster	21010	But you know, they were working pretty hard eight years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	24694	Both parties in Washington, the president and the Congress, have cut Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	22491	We do not need 4 more years of an economic theory that doesn't work.	0
ClaimBuster	15832	And Barbara and I were sitting there before that Democratic convention.	1
ClaimBuster	7315	And I regret to say that this administration has even blocked steps that could help us move further along.	0
ClaimBuster	13854	But I think in terms of the American people's concern about my commitment, I'm here tonight, folks; I never quit supporting you as you put me on the ballot in the other 26 states; and when you asked me to come back in, I came back in.	0
ClaimBuster	11744	He said that two divisions would have to report not ready for duty, and that's not what the joint chiefs say.	1
ClaimBuster	4208	Again, a little bit of naivete there.	0
ClaimBuster	13592	There are many people who believe that the only way we can get this country turned around is to tax the middle class more and punish them more, but the truth is that middle-class Americans are basically the only group of Americans who've been taxed more in the 1980s and during the last 12 years, even though their incomes have gone down.	1
ClaimBuster	27471	And of course, a military action is the last resort.	0
ClaimBuster	6663	"So if you're looking at a competitive world, you say to yourself, ""Hey, I do better overseas than I do here in America. """	0
ClaimBuster	16920	This is government by stalemate, and we've seen almost a complete breakdown in the proper relationship between the president, who represents this country, and the Congress, who collectively also represent this country.	0
ClaimBuster	34445	We have the greatest people on Earth in our military.	0
ClaimBuster	1718	On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that we've got to boost American energy production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than they've been in years.	1
ClaimBuster	17179	What I was referring to, of course, in the comment that you referred to was the situation in Lebanon.	0
ClaimBuster	20756	50 million of you won't receive it.	1
ClaimBuster	1269	We're expanding our homestead uh - housing program.	0
ClaimBuster	33618	Saudi Arabia, nothing but money.	0
ClaimBuster	18750	And we knew where the fuel rods were.	1
ClaimBuster	24206	Then we would present a plan to control health care costs and phase in health care coverage for all Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	17424	Before I campaigned as a Democrat for a Republican candidate for President, I had already voted for Dwight Eisenhower to be President of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	6809	The last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs.	1
ClaimBuster	19376	So I just want to try to correct it as we go along.	0
ClaimBuster	8471	We offered an amendment to do so.	1
ClaimBuster	7335	As president, I will make certain we travel it.	0
ClaimBuster	28055	It requires a different kind of leadership style to do it, though.	0
ClaimBuster	23418	I want to lower your cost to health care.	0
ClaimBuster	29694	Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods.	0
ClaimBuster	18869	It's one thing to be certain, but you can be certain and be wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	22857	That's what the Duelfer report showed.	1
ClaimBuster	16606	This makes it almost impossible for us to have a good health program.	0
ClaimBuster	21955	I don't think it's fair to say, you know, whatever it is, that if you haven't been hit by it personally.	0
ClaimBuster	11980	That doesn't mean we shouldn't fully enforce laws and fully protect people and fully honor people, which I will do as the President of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	4066	The Iranians have a lousy government, so therefore their economy is lousy, even though they have significant oil revenues.	0
ClaimBuster	19549	Thirdly, in Bosnia it's a virtual miracle that there has been no return to war and at least there has now been an election.	1
ClaimBuster	17503	And it's a personal and private, moral judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	20932	You can say you do to the cameras but you don't, unless you've changed your plan here on the stage.	0
ClaimBuster	22320	I commend it to anybody.	0
ClaimBuster	29169	In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.	1
ClaimBuster	27680	It's important for the nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	25560	I believe in a sensible arms control approach that brings down these weapons to manageable levels.	0
ClaimBuster	29518	We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.	0
ClaimBuster	26600	You can also use those accounts for health care or education or a first home.	1
ClaimBuster	28659	If you're from Washington, you want to pick and choose winners.	0
ClaimBuster	5681	But it's not going to solve the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	32416	Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things -- WikiLeaks that just came out.	1
ClaimBuster	14936	I see my time is running out here.	0
ClaimBuster	7601	In my speech last night I indicated that I thought that Cuba one day again would be free.	1
ClaimBuster	24809	And I can't tell you what it means to me at these rallies when I see you and you come up and the look in your eyes -- and I know how you feel and you know how I feel.	0
ClaimBuster	33373	The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody.	1
ClaimBuster	1377	We uh - streamlined the structure of the court, put in administrative officers, put a unified court system in, required that all uh - severe sentences be reviewed far uniformity.	0
ClaimBuster	16275	And I think that's one reason why we need fresh leadership in the White House that can make progress now in bringing peace to the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	27204	And for that to happen, we have to strengthen our economy here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	5647	And the point is that we become energy independent and we will create millions of jobs -- millions of jobs in America.	0
ClaimBuster	33765	You were very much involved -- excuse me.	0
ClaimBuster	21476	How would he feel about it?	0
ClaimBuster	2010	I mean, you have said before you'd cut the deficit in half.	1
ClaimBuster	27622	Well, we're going to be finished by 2014, and when I'm president, we'll make sure we bring our troops out by the end of 2014.	0
ClaimBuster	12079	I mean, the fact is that there -- even though no state wants them, there are guns in some schools.	0
ClaimBuster	17766	Will you finally touch that defense budget?	0
ClaimBuster	23121	I have a plan to cover all children.	0
ClaimBuster	21500	We'll have a debate in 4 days and we can talk about this character thing again.	1
ClaimBuster	23473	Most small businesses -- 70 percent of the new jobs in America are created by small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	16782	Congress has sustained forty-two vetoes.	1
ClaimBuster	17875	But I am determined that if ever our men are called on, they should have the best that we can provide in the manner of tools and weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	21429	We'll pass on the American dream to our children, and I will not leave our children a situation that they have today.	0
ClaimBuster	20663	In fact, in my ten-year budget proposal I've set aside more than twice as much for this purpose as Governor Bush has in his proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	228	I think we have to demonstrate some flexibility and I think the FDA is attempting to do so now in trying to make it possible for new and experimental drugs to be available to people who are at risk at AIDS and I would hope that we could bring that kind of a policy to bear beginning in January.	1
ClaimBuster	14361	But I think even more relevant is my record at home.	0
ClaimBuster	29235	That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.	1
ClaimBuster	8614	I think you should vote for Mr. Nixon.	0
ClaimBuster	29755	But when you look -- and Chicago's not the only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places.	0
ClaimBuster	7284	And the prosecutions are up by about 68 percent -- I believe -- is the number.	1
ClaimBuster	24524	And these old boys are not going to quit easy.	0
ClaimBuster	9087	The issue of nationalism - the recognition, he says, that every major problem confronting us is global, and cannot be solved by nationalism here or elsewhere - that is chauvinistic, that is parochial, that is as anachronistic as states' rights was in the days of Jefferson Davis.	1
ClaimBuster	18395	And as I just told you, there's going to be a summit of the Arab nations.	1
ClaimBuster	26104	They're created in the private sector.	1
ClaimBuster	23416	And the way I pay for it -- I'm not fiscally irresponsible -- is I roll back the tax cut this president so fiercely wants to defend, the one for him and me and Charlie.	1
ClaimBuster	16074	Andrea, why do people who want balanced budgets or to bring the deficit down always go to those programs which tend to benefit people of very modest means?	0
ClaimBuster	7301	"I was hunting in Iowa last year with a sheriff from one of the counties there, and he pointed to a house in back of us, and said, ""See the house over?"	1
ClaimBuster	34152	You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way.	0
ClaimBuster	15373	And today, you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what Republicanism represents in this country today.	0
ClaimBuster	33683	And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch-and-go situation.	1
ClaimBuster	19117	I have three very special people with me tonight: My wife, Elizabeth; my daughter, Robin, who has never let me down, and a fellow named Frank Carafa from New York, along with Ollie Manninen who helped me out in the mountains of Italy a few years back.	1
ClaimBuster	21868	Go home and look in the mirror.	0
ClaimBuster	1929	I'm glad you raised that, and it's a -- it's a critical issue.	0
ClaimBuster	14846	We've not only kept peace for our own country, but we've been able to extend the benefits of peace to others.	0
ClaimBuster	14651	And you have to make decisions even when it's against your own interest.	0
ClaimBuster	30100	They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else.	0
ClaimBuster	6468	Firehouses don't have enough firefighters in them.	0
ClaimBuster	11926	I would support the Orrin Hatch version of it, not the Senator Kennedy version.	0
ClaimBuster	2728	I've kept that promise and if you'll vote for me, then I promise I'll fight just as hard in a second term.	0
ClaimBuster	20777	You ask the Strunks whose plan makes more sense.	0
ClaimBuster	17143	And that's why the Congress, including the Republicans, have not gone along with the President's recommendations.	1
ClaimBuster	29308	We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable.	0
ClaimBuster	22371	I have a fearless forecast.	0
ClaimBuster	2718	And the reason is because of its people, because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that she's gotten; because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn't lay off workers during a recession.	1
ClaimBuster	16950	The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board should be independent.	0
ClaimBuster	32492	If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it's like a national catastrophe.	0
ClaimBuster	1081	I indicated under oath that the initiative that I took was at the request of the ranking members of the House Banking and Currency Committee on the Republican side, which was a legitimate request and a proper response by me.	1
ClaimBuster	644	I don't think we need them to remain strong.	0
ClaimBuster	8324	It recognizes that the government has a responsibility to get the farmer out of the trouble he presently is in because the government got him into it.	0
ClaimBuster	16968	This was an effort that was made by the attorney general and myself, working with the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	15515	But you know, Lloyd Bentsen jumped on Dan Quayle, when Dan Quayle said, he's had roughly the same amount of experience.	1
ClaimBuster	18662	"If the president had shown the patience to go through another round of resolution, to sit down with those leaders, say, ""What do you need, what do you need now, how much more will it take to get you to join us?"""	0
ClaimBuster	13404	We also have to see that all of the people of the United States - the tremendous talents that our people have - are used adequately.	0
ClaimBuster	29788	You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	9483	The only reason it's not happening is because Governor Romney's allies in Congress have held the 98 percent hostage because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	5542	Fifty percent of small business income taxes are paid by small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	21365	I ask everybody to look at my economic ideas and 9 Nobel prize winners and over 500 economists and hundreds of business people, including a lot of Republicans said, this is the way you've got to go.	1
ClaimBuster	8118	If we fail, then freedom fails.	0
ClaimBuster	1183	But I think this is indicative of what I would do.	0
ClaimBuster	11257	I think they've engaged in an evil behavior and I think that it is important that we understand they're not the old Soviet Union but they still have nationalist impulses that I think are very dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	20572	I'll tell you what kind of judges he'll put on.	0
ClaimBuster	24847	And in the process, as a result of that will and that decision and that toughness, we now have ancient enemies talking peace in the Middle East.	1
ClaimBuster	19794	But 11 million new jobs and everything, I mean the President can't take credit for everything that governors are doing, whether that's happening in New York City when it comes to the murder rate and then not be responsible for the bad things that happen, whether it's drug use or something else in America.	0
ClaimBuster	8435	This is not enough; it should be more.	0
ClaimBuster	13122	The whole th- the United States now has a treaty - which I voted for in the United States Senate in 1955 - to defend Formosa and the Pescadores Island.	1
ClaimBuster	8301	And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse.	0
ClaimBuster	3822	We've spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	34320	I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	17749	But now we need both that kind of discipline and the resources and the consistent leadership that allows this country to catch up in education and science and training.	0
ClaimBuster	13905	That's another way to improve the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	27987	I learned how to get along on the other side of the aisle.	0
ClaimBuster	13619	It's the private sector that creates jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	17575	You know, I wasn't going to say this at all, but I can't help it.	0
ClaimBuster	6665	I don't want American workers subsidizing the loss of their own job.	0
ClaimBuster	19252	And we can do it again, if we take politics out of it.	0
ClaimBuster	22209	We live in a world where what you earn depends on what you can learn, where the average 18- year-old will change jobs 8 times in a lifetime and where none of us can promise any of you that what you now do for a living is absolutely safe from now on.	1
ClaimBuster	16016	And I am going to keep that Social Security Trust Fund sound and keep our commitment to the elderly and maybe down the line, maybe when you get two decades or one into the next century, you're going to have to take another look at it, but not now.	0
ClaimBuster	13994	His whole deal is you've gotta be for it or against it, you can't make it better.	0
ClaimBuster	32428	But I don't know Putin.	1
ClaimBuster	2574	The role of government: Look behind us.	0
ClaimBuster	7218	$89 billion last year to the top 1 percent of Americans, but kids lost their after-school programs.	1
ClaimBuster	6623	And so we said: Let's raise the standards.	1
ClaimBuster	14328	Secondly, we got upset when he took the whole thing, but to the ordinary American out there who doesn't know where the oil fields are in Kuwait, they're near the border.	1
ClaimBuster	33716	Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world.	1
ClaimBuster	20687	But I went anyway because I knew if I didn't, somebody else in the small town of Carthage, Tennessee, would have to go in my place.	0
ClaimBuster	29215	They should have been doing this for years.	0
ClaimBuster	28101	Well, it's in this committee or it's got this sponsor.	0
ClaimBuster	19483	Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady Bill.	1
ClaimBuster	28718	And recently the Federal Trade Commission pointed out that some of these entertainment companies have warned parents that the material is inappropriate for children, and then they've turned around behind the backs of the parents and advertised that same adult material directly to children.	1
ClaimBuster	20039	And again I know Senator D'Amato I think may have had a hearing or two on Whitewater, I can't remember, but he's not my general chairman, he's a friend of mine.	1
ClaimBuster	7297	I've broken up organized crime.	1
ClaimBuster	22587	I can see why people at your workplace think he changes positions a lot, because he does.	1
ClaimBuster	18816	We will commit more over time to help.	0
ClaimBuster	32317	Why don't you interrupt her?	0
ClaimBuster	8010	We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if it's attacked.	1
ClaimBuster	6775	I believe that choice is a woman's choice.	0
ClaimBuster	17594	But if you take it in percentages, then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board.	0
ClaimBuster	1345	If we make the use of a gun in the commission.	0
ClaimBuster	148	I think it's the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down.	0
ClaimBuster	19347	I think it's very difficult.	0
ClaimBuster	32282	And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.	1
ClaimBuster	25850	It shouldn't happen in America.	0
ClaimBuster	26144	We all assume that the tax cuts will be permanent.	0
ClaimBuster	27551	And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn't take donors.	1
ClaimBuster	1530	For twenty-five years I served in the Congress under five presidents.	1
ClaimBuster	9661	When we talk about child care, and the credits that we're providing.	0
ClaimBuster	17393	And I think this is something the American people see.	0
ClaimBuster	4065	We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect.	0
ClaimBuster	9275	The administration brought a criminal action against the people drilling up there for oil, this massive new resource we have.	1
ClaimBuster	18741	And we've got a good strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	3208	And I believe that we used our skill.	0
ClaimBuster	20149	The auto worker in Toledo who was unemployed when I was elected and now has a great job because we're number one in auto production again.	1
ClaimBuster	16490	And Congress could have done that if the budget committees of the Congress, and the Congress as a whole, had not increased the spending that I recommended in the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	4249	But had it been done, it's possible we could have avoided the issue.	0
ClaimBuster	15335	I was opposing one piece of legislation versus another.	1
ClaimBuster	34158	He has consistently denied what is...	1
ClaimBuster	34449	Our policemen and women are disrespected.	0
ClaimBuster	15811	I think of Dr. Fauci.	0
ClaimBuster	11901	Well, I had thought that there was a controversy at the end of the legislative session where the hate crimes law in Texas was -- failed, and that the Byrd family, among others, asked you to support it, Governor, and it died in committee for lack of support.	0
ClaimBuster	7457	"I tell the people on the campaign trail, when I asked Laura to marry me, she said, ""Fine, just so long as I never have to give a speech."	1
ClaimBuster	10879	Senator McCain and I actually agree on something.	1
ClaimBuster	10933	You can keep your choice of doctor.	0
ClaimBuster	21120	It's time to have a leader that doesn't put off tomorrow what we should do today.	0
ClaimBuster	3430	How's it going to affect my house?	0
ClaimBuster	9936	In his first year, I was just getting -- licking my wounds from having been beaten by John McCain, all right.	0
ClaimBuster	32200	Obamacare is a total disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	31943	So this is who Donald Trump is.	0
ClaimBuster	25631	I would be writing a letter to people who know everything there is to know about us.	0
ClaimBuster	16918	I think under presidents For- uh - Nixon and Eisenhower they passed about 60 to 75 percent of their legislation.	1
ClaimBuster	21335	And free and fair trade is the answer, not protection.	0
ClaimBuster	27771	They have to understand we want to trade with them.	0
ClaimBuster	5909	And Democrats and Republicans alike, I think, acknowledge his expertise there.	0
ClaimBuster	9313	Oil production is up, natural gas production is up, and, most importantly, we're also starting to build cars that are more efficient.	1
ClaimBuster	4082	Iraq was Iran's mortal enemy.	1
ClaimBuster	20206	And in this election, America has to make an important choice.	1
ClaimBuster	11656	But because we had no allies and because it was very unclear that we could actually accomplish what we would want to accomplish about putting military forces there, I think it was the right thing not to jump in, as heartbreaking as it was, but I think we should have come in much quicker with the humanitarian mission.	0
ClaimBuster	33923	I think that it's been very well...	0
ClaimBuster	9862	But first of all, this is a nation of immigrants.	1
ClaimBuster	6304	So what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support.	0
ClaimBuster	11452	We need to do more.	0
ClaimBuster	30430	And I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice.	0
ClaimBuster	17275	My wife is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister.	1
ClaimBuster	32274	Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name.	0
ClaimBuster	25859	Remember when people almost used to walk across the street rather than have a contact with somebody who was in Vietnam?	0
ClaimBuster	8902	It's because they have lost their industry.	0
ClaimBuster	8767	It is going to cause scarcity in world markets because there are at least five reputable studies, one even by the American Petroleum Institute itself, that, I think, clearly indicate that somewhere along around the end of the present decade, total world demand for oil is simply going to exceed total available supplies.	1
ClaimBuster	32650	You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you.	1
ClaimBuster	30343	And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	32802	And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she's for it.	1
ClaimBuster	29179	My father was a small-businessman.	1
ClaimBuster	28721	And if they don't do it, we're gonna ask for tougher authority in the hands of the FTC on the false and deceptive advertising.	0
ClaimBuster	2100	I mean, I had a friend who said you don't just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, all right?	0
ClaimBuster	25943	We sent it to the Clinton Administration for implementation, and they waited three and a half years.	1
ClaimBuster	23056	"""I think that makes sense."	0
ClaimBuster	32494	And that's, like, no growth.	0
ClaimBuster	20690	For the last eight years I've served on the National Security Council, and when the conflict came up in Bosnia, I saw a genocide in the heart of Europe with the most violent war on the continent of Europe since World War II.	1
ClaimBuster	898	What kind of judgment sense has your chief education adviser now in jail in Massachusetts?	0
ClaimBuster	12397	And I have every right in the world to defend my record and positions.	0
ClaimBuster	18877	And it is one of the things I've learned in the White House, is that there's enormous pressure on the president, and he cannot wilt under that pressure.	0
ClaimBuster	14059	We're getting ready to dismantle the airlines industry in our country, and none of you know it.	1
ClaimBuster	32386	She's got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	23895	If there's more time for gridlock and talk and finger pointing, I'm the wrong man.	0
ClaimBuster	21069	I don't go along with it.	0
ClaimBuster	21391	And if the Congress won't do it, if they can't get together and negotiate how to do that, then you'd have a sequester across the board.	0
ClaimBuster	24161	The rest of the world practices 21st century capitalism.	0
ClaimBuster	27752	Now, they look at us and say, Is it a good idea to be with America?	0
ClaimBuster	22802	Sorry, time for diplomacy is over.	0
ClaimBuster	14415	Let's take Mr. Bush for the moment at his word -- he's right, we don't have any evidence at least that our government did tell Saddam Hussein he could have that part of Kuwait.	1
ClaimBuster	32263	As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people.	1
ClaimBuster	32739	And we have -- look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me.	1
ClaimBuster	27772	We want a world that's stable.	0
ClaimBuster	32723	The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul.	0
ClaimBuster	7802	But it's also tremendously important to bear in mind that when you pour in money without pouring in technical assistance at w- as well, that you have a disastrous situation.	0
ClaimBuster	8205	What has happened to you?	0
ClaimBuster	15017	We initiated a very fine urban renewal program, working with the mayors, the governors, and other interested officials.	0
ClaimBuster	13083	It is a commitment that we have to meet if we're going to protect the security of Western Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	4135	Spain is a NATO ally.	1
ClaimBuster	13443	That includes oil; it includes all kinds of minerals; it includes everything within the range of taxation.	0
ClaimBuster	27037	Now, it is absolutely true that we cannot just meet these challenges militarily.	0
ClaimBuster	19776	But I believe America is the greatest country in human history because we have maintained freedom and increasing prosperity by relentlessly pushing the barriers of knowledge, the barriers of the present, always moving into the future.	0
ClaimBuster	26781	Let me say again, there is no more important responsibility for the president than to say if you believe in the constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence, that's all we need to know.	0
ClaimBuster	9705	And his forecast for the next four years is more deficits, almost that large.	1
ClaimBuster	16765	They would not have materialized for about nine to eighteen months.	0
ClaimBuster	1409	So, I would say somebody in the format of uh - Justice Stevens would be the kind of an individual that I would uh - select in the future, as I did him in the past.	0
ClaimBuster	23070	He made it illegal, illegal for Medicare to do what the V.A.	1
ClaimBuster	23495	I can remember being in upstate New York talking to FBI agents that helped bust a Lackawanna cell up there.	0
ClaimBuster	23947	But when Joe McCarthy went around this country attacking people's patriotism he was wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	23100	We both believe that, as lawyers -- I'm a lawyer, too.	0
ClaimBuster	2560	And as a consequence, you had 46 states around the country who have made a real difference.	1
ClaimBuster	29366	We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.	0
ClaimBuster	7471	And not only did she interest me, I guess you would say it was love at first sight.	0
ClaimBuster	22417	One is to reduce spending -- controlling that mandatory spending.	0
ClaimBuster	26133	Ours are permanent, ours is a good plan.	0
ClaimBuster	10577	Senator Obama's name was not on that letter.	1
ClaimBuster	12072	We do have a serious problem in our culture.	0
ClaimBuster	10252	I talk to small businesses across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	3346	So far, Mr. Ford has not responded.	1
ClaimBuster	13157	But I hope the next Administration - and if I have anything to do with it, the next Administration will - make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing, control of nuclear weapons, if possible, control of outer space, free from weapons, and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels.	0
ClaimBuster	29382	I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.	0
ClaimBuster	8192	We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration.	0
ClaimBuster	21263	I know one thing about the position of president, it's the only position in our Constitution that is filled by an individual who is given the responsibility to fight not just for one state or one district or the well-connected or wealthy, but to fight for all of the people, including especially those who most need somebody who will stand up and take on whatever powerful forces might stand in the way.	0
ClaimBuster	15207	This is a formidable force.	0
ClaimBuster	17653	We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy.	1
ClaimBuster	17229	"'', he said, ""Cut those things I asked for but didn't get.''"	1
ClaimBuster	28884	See, an educated child is one much more likely to be hopeful and optimistic.	0
ClaimBuster	32244	President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan.	1
ClaimBuster	20200	I would like to thank Governor Bush for participating, and I would like to say I'm happy to be here with Tipper and our family.	0
ClaimBuster	926	I would oppose that, but I think were on the right track in agriculture and I am very very encouraged.	0
ClaimBuster	5569	I want small businesses -- and by the way, the small businesses that we're talking about would receive an increase in their taxes right now.	1
ClaimBuster	7694	Thirdly, I don't believe that the government contracts division is operated with vigor.	0
ClaimBuster	18390	The plan says we'll train Iraqi soldiers so they can do the hard work, and we are.	1
ClaimBuster	8938	And eliminated probably more quickly than our plan, but we wanted to be so conservative with it, that people would see how.	0
ClaimBuster	25861	Thank you for doing what you're doing.	0
ClaimBuster	7887	I have participated in the discussions leading to the decisions in this Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	13884	But one mistake he's made is fuel efficiency standards at 40 to 45 miles a gallon will throw many auto workers out of work, and you can't have it both ways.	1
ClaimBuster	16297	This is another example of misplaced priorities.	0
ClaimBuster	3944	And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front -- that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan.	1
ClaimBuster	9697	Number two, trade -- I'll crack down on China, President Bush didn't.	1
ClaimBuster	32647	But you were in contact -- excuse me.	0
ClaimBuster	26749	Now, I think I have to let Senator Dole speak for himself.	0
ClaimBuster	18386	I'm optimistic we'll achieve -- I know we won't achieve if we send mixed signals.	0
ClaimBuster	15842	And so I would say that the concept of the Dukakis family has my great respect.	0
ClaimBuster	7671	Secondly, what's he going to do to provide fair employment?	0
ClaimBuster	27237	That way we can invest in the research and technology that's always kept us at the cutting edge.	0
ClaimBuster	19623	We have to be firm and strong.	0
ClaimBuster	17857	Productivity in the first half of 1980 was down a minus 2 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	28852	No, it doesn't speak for itself, Mr. Vice President, it speaks for the fact that there are certain rules in this that we all agree to, but evidently rules don't mean anything.	0
ClaimBuster	25440	Now, this is the most dangerous technology that we possess.	0
ClaimBuster	24542	Thirdly, we ought to have boot camps for first-time nonviolent offenders so they can get discipline and treatment and education and get reconnected to the community before they're severed and sent to prison, where they can learn how to be first class criminals.	0
ClaimBuster	13958	I think it is exports that have saved us when we're in a global slowdown, a connected global slowdown, a recession in some countries.	0
ClaimBuster	2276	You can't have a free market work if you don't have regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	17026	I think the real issue in this campaign, and that which you must decide on November second, is whether you should vote for his promise or my performance in two years in the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	17906	I believe there's fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system.	0
ClaimBuster	22691	Senator Richard Lugar, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that the handling of the reconstruction aid in Iraq by this administration has been incompetent.	1
ClaimBuster	19047	We'll continue to build our alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	10930	So one of the things that I have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing.	1
ClaimBuster	3645	Well, you know, let me just...	0
ClaimBuster	22644	He's trying to attack me.	1
ClaimBuster	7075	That has the benefit of making sure our employers aren't breaking the law as they try to fill their workforce needs.	0
ClaimBuster	3692	We've got to invest in science and technology.	0
ClaimBuster	17431	The farmers are not the victims of anything this administration has done.	1
ClaimBuster	33690	So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down.	0
ClaimBuster	754	It is the best anti-terrorist report written.	0
ClaimBuster	679	We have serious differences with the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	18471	And that's not how a commander in chief acts.	0
ClaimBuster	25322	And I supported this bill.	1
ClaimBuster	28044	Now, Mr. Hankins, I think that the situation that you describe has gotten completely out of hand.	0
ClaimBuster	25273	They're tough negotiators, but all previous Presidents have made progress.	1
ClaimBuster	23282	And looking around here, at this group here, I suspect there are only three people here who are going to be affected: the president, me, and, Charlie, I'm sorry, you too.	0
ClaimBuster	18836	He changes positions on something as fundamental as what you believe in your core, in your heart of hearts, is right in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	30370	Did you ask me a question?	0
ClaimBuster	18148	Can I respond to that?	0
ClaimBuster	33037	I will bring our energy companies back.	0
ClaimBuster	13644	But we faced it and we did it, and we believe it's fair, shared sacrifice.	0
ClaimBuster	13267	The reason Indochina was preserved was the result of the Geneva Conference which Indochina.	1
ClaimBuster	1484	Well, that's not exactly an accurate description of what happened.	0
ClaimBuster	14383	They investigated every single one of my children.	1
ClaimBuster	24271	Every time our interest rates go up one percent, that adds 28 billion dollars to the deficit or to the debt.	1
ClaimBuster	3978	But I'm confident, now that General Petraeus is in the new position of command, that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops -- and, by the way, there have been 20,000 additional troops, from 32,000 to 53,000, and there needs to be more.	1
ClaimBuster	9603	And that's an example of the kind of advocacy that we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family.	0
ClaimBuster	24088	If people don't have the stomach to fix these problems, I think it's a good time to face it, November.	0
ClaimBuster	25395	The second thing is this all assumes that the Soviets wouldn't respond in kind.	0
ClaimBuster	32735	I can't think of any.	0
ClaimBuster	1933	So how do we deal with it?	0
ClaimBuster	20790	I believe college tuition up to $10,000 per year ought to be tax deductible so middle-class families can choose to send their children to college.	0
ClaimBuster	18025	The enemy understands a free Iraq will be a major defeat in their ideology of hatred.	0
ClaimBuster	28906	One of the things that happens when you're a governor, at least oftentimes you have to make tough decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	33730	And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right.	1
ClaimBuster	27448	Number two, with regards to Iran and the threat of Iran, there's no question but that a nuclear Iran, a nuclear-capable Iran is unacceptable to America.	0
ClaimBuster	10168	And it's referred to as an assault weapon ban, but it had, at the signing of the bill, both the pro-gun and the anti-gun people came together, because it provided opportunities for both that both wanted.	1
ClaimBuster	7194	We have a long distance yet to travel in terms of fairness in America.	0
ClaimBuster	116	We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20-25 billion a year, which is what we've been doing under this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	8601	I want to make sure that it stays in that relationship.	0
ClaimBuster	18137	Humvees -- 10,000 out of 12,000 Humvees that are over there aren't armored.	1
ClaimBuster	15970	In other states, we've done it.	1
ClaimBuster	7397	We have a separate and unequal school system in the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	12432	The -- I haven't seen that, in my commercials?	0
ClaimBuster	11960	I don't think they ought to have special rights, but I think they ought to have the same rights.	0
ClaimBuster	9250	That's why we doubled clean -- clean energy production like wind and solar and biofuels.	1
ClaimBuster	26521	How many of you like it?	0
ClaimBuster	5650	Some people say that's a hatchet.	0
ClaimBuster	18495	You know, my hardest -- the hardest part of the job is to know that I committed the troops in harm's way and then do the best I can to provide comfort for the loved ones who lost a son or a daughter or a husband or wife.	1
ClaimBuster	24109	You see, I don't think we need to tax more and spend more, and then say that's going to make the problem better.	0
ClaimBuster	2019	As a matter of fact, it's growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement.	1
ClaimBuster	6746	It also defined marriage as between a man and woman.	1
ClaimBuster	6786	"And as President Kennedy said when he ran for president, he said, ""I'm not running to be a Catholic president."	1
ClaimBuster	16444	Here a very small investment of taxpayer's money - in the housing field can bring large numbers of extra jobs, and the guarantee of mortgage loans, and the uh - putting forward of uh - two-0-two programs for housing for older people and so forth to cut down the roughly 20 percent unemployment that now exists in the - in the construction industry.	1
ClaimBuster	1319	But short of the constitutional amendment, and within the confines of the Supreme Court rulings, I'll do everything I can to minimize the need for abortions with better sex education, family planning, with better adoptive procedures.	0
ClaimBuster	19641	And everybody knows, including the Wall Street Journal, hardly a friend of the Democratic party of this administration, that the '82 tax increase he sponsored in inflation-adjusted dollars was the biggest tax increase in American history.	1
ClaimBuster	34105	But we know we've got lots of work to do.	0
ClaimBuster	11689	We got intimately involved in building NATO and other structures there.	1
ClaimBuster	24033	But let's not cut into the muscle, and let's not cut down our insurance policy, which is participation of American forces in NATO, the greatest peace- keeping organization ever made.	1
ClaimBuster	24638	So I would think we can expedite the problem there.	0
ClaimBuster	10606	It's now over $10 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	27262	And that's where we're going right now unless we finally get off this spending and borrowing binge.	0
ClaimBuster	21020	The key is job training, education, investments in health care and education, environment, retirement security.	0
ClaimBuster	10440	And a lot of you I think are worried about your jobs, your pensions, your retirement accounts, your ability to send your child or your grandchild to college.	0
ClaimBuster	17290	And I think if we want to continue -- as I do -- to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it.	0
ClaimBuster	32507	Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift.	0
ClaimBuster	6909	We allow you -- if you choose to, you don't have to -- but we give you broader competition to allow you to buy into the same health care plan that senators and congressmen give themselves.	1
ClaimBuster	11526	And it's going to be hard, it's going to be important to rebuild that coalition to keep the pressure on him.	0
ClaimBuster	19534	The President didn't have much to do about it.	0
ClaimBuster	11327	But here's what I do know.	0
ClaimBuster	13516	Mr. Dulles has suggested it's from two to three times as great as ours.	1
ClaimBuster	8388	The program - the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon-Javits program - would have cost, if fully used uh - six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state.	1
ClaimBuster	27761	They look at America's commitments around the world and they see what's happening, and they say, well, OK. Is America going to be strong?	0
ClaimBuster	13276	That's not the position he's taking.	1
ClaimBuster	18739	There's a special protocol recently been passed that allows for inspections.	1
ClaimBuster	29462	We've looked at your tax proposals.	0
ClaimBuster	10674	All three you mentioned are compelling national security requirements.	0
ClaimBuster	2395	You keep your own insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	19110	And I look forward to discussing exactly how we're going to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	9896	They'll make things happen to create jobs here in the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	28411	I'm not going to ask them.	0
ClaimBuster	26661	I visited a Chrysler dealership in Tokyo.	1
ClaimBuster	14284	You don't see Margaret Tutwiler sitting in there with me today.	1
ClaimBuster	22086	Six increases in the payroll tax -- that means people with incomes of $51,000 a year or less pay a disproportionally high share of the federal tax burden, which is why I want some middle-class tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	31915	And women have respect for me.	0
ClaimBuster	29608	I have a great company.	0
ClaimBuster	16660	We - uh believe that uh you can revise the federal criminal code, which has not been revised in a good many years.	1
ClaimBuster	34352	We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.	0
ClaimBuster	16332	I believe that public service is honorable.	0
ClaimBuster	20873	He has a 15-year-old daughter named Caley, who is in Sarasota High School.	1
ClaimBuster	150	They do all the spending, they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime.	0
ClaimBuster	29662	And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	20821	It's about Kipp Academy in Houston, Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	31844	"That's why the slogan of my campaign is ""Stronger Together,"" because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals -- and I've set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else."	0
ClaimBuster	9486	That's part of what took us from deficits to surplus.	1
ClaimBuster	15784	Well, I think when I think of heroes, I think back, not presently, Ann.	0
ClaimBuster	14174	I believe that -- I believe I made a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	373	Well, I certainly hope not.	0
ClaimBuster	23424	And we're going to put our laboratories and our colleges and our universities to work.	0
ClaimBuster	25400	We have more at stake in space satellites than they do.	0
ClaimBuster	7196	And yet the president who talks about No Child Left Behind refused to fully fund -- by $28 billion -- that particular program so you can make a difference in the lives of those young people.	1
ClaimBuster	24575	And I've done everything I could in my public life to overcome racial divisions.	0
ClaimBuster	33535	They've taken over the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	4154	"And we ought to go back to a little bit of Ronald Reagan's ""trust, but verify,"" and certainly not sit down across the table from -- without precondition, as Senator Obama said he did twice, I mean, it's just dangerous."	1
ClaimBuster	3921	... withdrawal would be dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	27521	Our diplomatic isolation needs to be tougher.	0
ClaimBuster	6141	That's what I'm all about.	0
ClaimBuster	4090	Now here's what we need to do.	0
ClaimBuster	13094	I do not mean by that that one party is a war party and the other party is a peace party.	0
ClaimBuster	33990	And we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago, Chris.	0
ClaimBuster	17897	Are we better off when we deemphasize our values in human rights?	0
ClaimBuster	25054	Make the Soviets pay for their irresponsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	19030	I believe America's best days are ahead of us because I believe that the future belongs to freedom, not to fear.	0
ClaimBuster	33890	This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country, where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies.	1
ClaimBuster	26059	But at the same time, if you want to get off Medicare, get back in the mainstream, we're going to provide jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	5995	I believe in free trade.	0
ClaimBuster	32514	I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars.	0
ClaimBuster	13350	This is a difficult and sensitive matter.	0
ClaimBuster	5954	There are several issues in which, frankly, Joe Biden and I openly and honestly disagreed on national security policy, and he's been wrong on a number of the major ones.	1
ClaimBuster	6969	It was a committee chaired by the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a Democrat.	1
ClaimBuster	3269	And the United States will maintain our national security interest in the Panama Canal.	0
ClaimBuster	12683	We have five treaties with Latin America, including the one setting up the Organization of American States in Bogota in 1948, in which we have agreed not to intervene in the internal affairs of any other American country - and they as well have agreed to do likewise.	1
ClaimBuster	32520	And I think it's been unfortunate, but it's happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top.	1
ClaimBuster	21871	And as a private citizen, believe me, you are looked on as a major nuisance.	0
ClaimBuster	19611	In 1992, before I became President, the Congress passed the Cuba Democracy Act and I enforced it vigorously.	1
ClaimBuster	15499	Well, a lot of what this campaign is about, it seems to me Bernie, goes to the question of values.	0
ClaimBuster	133	When you cut capital gains, you put people to work.	0
ClaimBuster	12462	Jim, thank you very much.	0
ClaimBuster	8239	Because it isn't a question of how much the federal government spends; it isn't a question of which government does the most.	0
ClaimBuster	34186	He has all the conspiracy theories...	0
ClaimBuster	7034	People listening out there know the benefits of the tax cuts we passed.	0
ClaimBuster	12365	I just cited an example of the administration just unilaterally acting without any input.	1
ClaimBuster	5838	"But to somehow say that group of young women who said ""Military wives for McCain"" are somehow saying anything derogatory about you, but anything -- and those veterans that wear those hats that say ""World War II, Vietnam, Korea, Iraq,"" I'm not going to stand for people saying that the people that come to my rallies are anything but the most dedicated, patriotic men and women that are in this nation and they're great citizens."	0
ClaimBuster	17278	Whether that helps or not, I don't know.	0
ClaimBuster	25179	Not at all, Mr. Trewhitt, and I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	4093	But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked.	0
ClaimBuster	3323	And I think it's a disgrace that so far Mr. Ford's administration has blocked the passage of legislation that would've revealed by law every instance of the boycott and it would've prevented the boycott from continuing.	1
ClaimBuster	9337	You had a whole bunch of oil companies who had leases on public lands that they weren't using.	1
ClaimBuster	25636	And then I thought to myself, what are they going to say about us, what are those people 100 years from now going to think?	0
ClaimBuster	14689	High tech executives in Northern California.	1
ClaimBuster	13913	See, there's a lot I don't understand.	0
ClaimBuster	5535	I would like to mention that a couple days ago Senator Obama was out in Ohio and he had an encounter with a guy who's a plumber, his name is Joe Wurzelbacher.	1
ClaimBuster	10985	But government mandates I -- I'm always a little nervous about.	0
ClaimBuster	14626	So let's come back to harsh reality, and what I -- you know, everybody says, gee, Perot, you're tough.	0
ClaimBuster	13462	And so he would be doing exactly the wrong thing.	0
ClaimBuster	11919	There may be some other statute that was already on the books, but certainly the advocates of the hate crimes law felt that a tough new law was needed.	0
ClaimBuster	8843	I don't think I'd have to go against that pledge.	0
ClaimBuster	20996	But it started for me in the last eight years when I had the honor of casting the tie-breaking vote to end the old economic plan here at home and put into place a new economic plan that has helped us to make some progress, 22 million new jobs, the greatest prosperity ever.	1
ClaimBuster	25016	"But I am not going to pick out one and, in advance, hypothetically say, ""Oh, yes, we would send troops there.''"	0
ClaimBuster	32339	But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion.	1
ClaimBuster	18986	"I mean, this is the president who said ""There were weapons of mass destruction,"" said ""Mission accomplished,"" said we could fight the war on the cheap -- none of which were true."	1
ClaimBuster	1192	And if he should ever become uh - the president of the United States, with his vast experience as member the House and a member of the Senate, as well as a vice president, I think he would do an outstanding job as president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	11202	We have to double the size of the Afghan army.	0
ClaimBuster	16883	In the last two years, we have restored integrity in the White House, and we've set high standards in the executive branch of the government.	0
ClaimBuster	29052	A promise made will be a promise kept should I be fortunate enough to become your president.	0
ClaimBuster	14488	And if you watch it Thursday, Friday, Saturday this week, you'll get more.	0
ClaimBuster	9907	"His main strategy during the Republican primary was to say, ""We're going to encourage self-deportation."""	1
ClaimBuster	5848	You know, here's what I would say.	0
ClaimBuster	28128	All right, here we go again.	0
ClaimBuster	32372	Let me tell you, I'm going to force them right back into their country.	0
ClaimBuster	15448	Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago?	0
ClaimBuster	7321	They don't reach those goals.	0
ClaimBuster	16829	This permits a company to create uh - a dummy corporation, to export their products, and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them.	1
ClaimBuster	31983	Mine are words, and his was action.	0
ClaimBuster	14875	In addition to that, the build-up of military forces is good for our country because we've got to have military strength to preserve the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	25117	We were there for the better part of a year.	1
ClaimBuster	10261	OK. We need to create jobs here.	0
ClaimBuster	22978	This president chose a tax cut over homeland security.	1
ClaimBuster	13008	We had a good neighbor policy, yes.	0
ClaimBuster	3496	But -- but let me -- let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that.	1
ClaimBuster	16135	There are plenty of places to cut.	0
ClaimBuster	13798	The only thing I would say about that is, I think that on the economy, Mr. Bush said for a long time there was no recession, and then said it would be better to do nothing than to have a compromise effort with the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	5832	Well, let me just say I would...	0
ClaimBuster	20251	And my plan say why don't we pass 1.3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills?	0
ClaimBuster	22217	They could borrow the money and pay it back as a percentage of their income or with a couple of years of service to our nation here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	11235	But we can't just provide moral support.	0
ClaimBuster	2607	So all federal funds, instead of going to the -- to the state or to the school district, I'd have go, if you will, follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their -- their -- their student.	0
ClaimBuster	9732	When I said that we had to make sure that China was not flooding our domestic market with cheap tires, Governor Romney said I was being protectionist; that it wouldn't be helpful to American workers.	1
ClaimBuster	2331	But that's not what I believe.	0
ClaimBuster	12800	But then if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the Russians and then we'll have to meet our responsibilities to the security of the United States, and there may have to be testing underground.	0
ClaimBuster	7797	I believe we can do it.	0
ClaimBuster	1736	The people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	19699	I don't understand extending the no-fly zone in the south when the trouble was in the north.	0
ClaimBuster	24923	We've seen in the Nicaraguan example a policy that has actually hurt us, strengthened our opposition, and undermined the moral authority of our country in that region.	0
ClaimBuster	23086	Actually, Mr. President, in 1997 we fixed Medicare, and I was one of the people involved in it.	1
ClaimBuster	17788	But I tell you also now, Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	8872	I'm happy to say that, in contrast to that, the Anderson-Lucey platform for America, program for the 80s, has devoted considerable time, and in very specific detail, we have talked about two things that ought to be done to aid urban America.	1
ClaimBuster	27366	It's not driven by politics.	1
ClaimBuster	29234	We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s.	1
ClaimBuster	5588	The fact is that businesses in America today are paying the second highest tax rate of anywhere in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	17912	I believe in opening doors.	0
ClaimBuster	12609	There isn't one country in the Middle East that now endorses the Eisenhower Doctrine.	1
ClaimBuster	13511	There have been several indications that our prestige is not as high as it once was.	0
ClaimBuster	12120	In fact, I'm for shrinking the size of government.	1
ClaimBuster	33835	If it wasn't, they get their 10 minutes of fame.	0
ClaimBuster	12740	We have moved in Latin America very effectively, and I'd also like to point this out: Senator Kennedy complains very appropriately about our inadequate ra- radio broadcasts for Latin America.	1
ClaimBuster	23774	The farm income in America is high.	1
ClaimBuster	78	But we also have to take demand seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	16065	These appointments are for life.	1
ClaimBuster	33169	I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now.	0
ClaimBuster	21232	I want to finally get something done on Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	26070	Let me get out of your way here.	0
ClaimBuster	24994	The Soviet Union has been engaged in the biggest military buildup in the history of man at the same time that we tried the policy of unilateral disarmament, of weakness, if you will.	1
ClaimBuster	27735	Over the long term, in order for us to compete with China, we've also got to make sure, though, that we're taking -- taking care of business here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	8956	I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983, and it is a combination of planned reduction of the tax increase that Carter has built into the economy, and that's what he's counting on for his plan.	0
ClaimBuster	27035	You just gave a speech a few weeks ago in which you said we should still have troops in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	26506	But it seems to me if we start to take choices away from people and if we drive them into one type care, eliminate fee-for-service altogether or eliminate the fact you can go to your own doctor, you have to go somewhere else, then I think we've taken a giant step backward in the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	26289	You can have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, which the President opposed and defeated.	1
ClaimBuster	21647	I'm not a politician, but I think I could go to Washington in a week and get everybody holding hands and get this bill signed because I talk to the Democratic leaders and they want it.	0
ClaimBuster	18467	I don't think he was misleading.	0
ClaimBuster	22099	Well, we have come to that position.	0
ClaimBuster	15406	But I would like to call the attention of the people to the fact that that so-called simple amendment would be used by mischievous men to destroy discriminations that properly belong, by law, to women respecting the physical differences between the two sexes, labor laws that protect them against things that would be physically harmful to them.	0
ClaimBuster	11109	But I do believe that we have to change our policies with Pakistan.	0
ClaimBuster	24127	So that one we came away with in creating jobs for the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	29826	I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders.	1
ClaimBuster	33145	You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be?	0
ClaimBuster	9759	I committed that I would rein in the excesses of Wall Street, and we passed the toughest Wall Street reforms since the 1930s.	1
ClaimBuster	7018	And we'll make whatever adjustment is necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	1349	Those are the people who ought to be in jail.	0
ClaimBuster	19286	It's a good package, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	11216	Now, long ago, I warned about Vladimir Putin.	1
ClaimBuster	23627	You'll actually do a better job, I think, of passing on the moral responsibility that is expressed in your question.	0
ClaimBuster	29801	And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?	0
ClaimBuster	19891	I was able for two years when I was in, a very young boy to go to a Catholic school, but I basically went to public schools all my life.	1
ClaimBuster	10439	I think everybody knows now we are in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	10344	I believe we have a responsibility to care for one another.	0
ClaimBuster	8964	more than doubled, and it rose at a faster rate than spending was rising in the Federal Government.	1
ClaimBuster	22047	That's because it comes at you, not from you.	0
ClaimBuster	271	And I wish we had time to let me explain.	0
ClaimBuster	15146	And his emissary, I think, came home in 12 hours having heard a very definite nyet.	0
ClaimBuster	25700	This is what this election is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	20656	Bonus plans to keep some of our high-skilled folks in the services and a commander in chief who clearly sets the mission.	0
ClaimBuster	28058	It says, for example, that a woman doesn't have to go through a gate keeper to go to her gynecologist.	1
ClaimBuster	9985	Governor Romney says he wasn't referring to Arizona as a model for the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	29498	We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble.	0
ClaimBuster	18287	But the president made a mistake in invading Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	19439	Let me say again, we did have a drug czar in Arkansas, but he answered to the governor, just like this one answers to the President.	1
ClaimBuster	26927	And as a consequence, Al Qaeda's core leadership has been decimated.	1
ClaimBuster	3425	You know, we are at a defining moment in our history.	0
ClaimBuster	16263	But those are the issues on which we ought to be debating and if we can just put away the flag factories and the balloons and those kinds of thing and get on to a real discussion of these issues, I think we will have a good success.	0
ClaimBuster	19925	We've got ten and a half million new jobs; we've got record numbers of those new small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	25716	I think what really matters is what we can do to build strong families.	0
ClaimBuster	16847	So where else would you raise the revenue to provide this tax relief - would you, in fact, do away with all business deductions, and what other kinds of preferences would you do away with?	0
ClaimBuster	8891	And in my view, this is not the answer to the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	17487	Somebody went to a woman and nearly killed her.	1
ClaimBuster	17579	I can understand why you are, Mr. Mondale, because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	11409	I've been able to set clear goals.	0
ClaimBuster	3995	We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	29516	You know what that is?	0
ClaimBuster	5511	Well, first of all, I want to thank Hofstra University and the people of New York for hosting us tonight and it's wonderful to join Senator McCain again, and thank you, Bob.	0
ClaimBuster	417	But if we spend and spend and spend, that is going to wrap up the housing market, and we'll go right back to the days of the misery index and malaise that President Reagan and I have overcome - thank God for the United States on that one.	0
ClaimBuster	33689	So now we've dug ourselves out of it, we're standing, but we're not yet running.	0
ClaimBuster	14688	Look at the Republicans that have endorsed me.	0
ClaimBuster	6849	The reason health-care costs are getting higher, one of the principal reasons is that this administration has stood in the way of common-sense efforts that would have reduced the costs.	0
ClaimBuster	11149	You're doing a great job, Tom.	0
ClaimBuster	11471	We need to insist that Arafat send out instructions to halt some of the provocative acts of violence that have been going on.	0
ClaimBuster	3259	I would never give up complete control or practical control of the Panama Canal Zone, but I would continue to negotiate with the Panamanians.	0
ClaimBuster	2923	Governor Carter again contradicts himself.	0
ClaimBuster	17212	Now, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they weren't to be abhorred -- that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment.	1
ClaimBuster	1898	Jim, the president began this segment, so I think I get the last word.	1
ClaimBuster	18725	And so I decided that a better way to approach the issue was to get other nations involved, just besides us.	0
ClaimBuster	34175	We need to go after the leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	33420	That is a rank mischaracterization.	0
ClaimBuster	18054	We had Saddam Hussein trapped.	1
ClaimBuster	10617	We've got to invest in college affordability.	0
ClaimBuster	786	You judge on the record.	0
ClaimBuster	18628	It must -- as a last resort.	0
ClaimBuster	5634	I just want to get back to this home ownership.	0
ClaimBuster	28780	I didn't care whether he was a Republican or Democrat.	0
ClaimBuster	27241	And taking us back to those kinds of strategies that got us into this mess are not the way that we are going to maintain leadership in the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	17457	So, this has been my feeling about abortion, that we have a problem now to determine -- and all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being.	0
ClaimBuster	33834	I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward.	0
ClaimBuster	8472	Forty-four Democrats voted for it, one Republican voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	20230	And that stands in contrast to my worthy opponent's plan, which will increase the size of government dramatically.	1
ClaimBuster	15599	But sooner or later that credit card mentality isn't going to work.	0
ClaimBuster	206	My state just became the only state in the nation to provide for universal health care and we did it with the support of the business community and labor and the health care community and with virtually everybody in the state.	1
ClaimBuster	26039	American seniors have the highest life expectancy in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	10366	I'll get our incomes up.	0
ClaimBuster	21145	The man loves his wife and I appreciate that a lot.	0
ClaimBuster	24163	In the rest of the world, the countries and the businesses would be working together to make this transition in an intelligent way.	0
ClaimBuster	22619	And I saw a unique threat in Saddam Hussein, as did my opponent, because we thought he had weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	11856	People are stopped, and we have to do something about that.	0
ClaimBuster	1563	We have been discouraged and we've been alienated.	0
ClaimBuster	29118	We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.	0
ClaimBuster	24332	There's no question about that.	0
ClaimBuster	26434	Hiring people temporarily who have lost their jobs and they get to work for 30 days or 60 days.	1
ClaimBuster	14194	Let's go back to the tax and budget summit briefly.	0
ClaimBuster	21653	That's not bad for a guy that's never been there, right?	0
ClaimBuster	23065	And we're asking to be able to allow you to get them.	0
ClaimBuster	30381	The world -- let me tell you.	0
ClaimBuster	7072	If you can make 50 cents in the heart of Mexico, for example, or make $5 here in America, $5.15, you're going to come here if you're worth your salt, if you want to put food on the table for your families.	0
ClaimBuster	26009	It's obvious that there are certain things that have to be done and there are 50 or 60 different options, and a bipartisan commission to take it out of politics, will make recommendations and build support for the people.	0
ClaimBuster	27975	And there are two very different paths the country can take.	0
ClaimBuster	30353	And sadly, she doesn't have that.	0
ClaimBuster	18895	"I wrote a book about it several years ago -- six, seven years ago -- called ""The New War,"" which saw the difficulties of this international criminal network."	1
ClaimBuster	12418	I hope they're not awful things.	0
ClaimBuster	29403	She's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	8231	Now, when we look at these programs, might I suggest that in evaluating them we often have a tendency to say that the test of a program is how much you're spending.	0
ClaimBuster	19383	And then Senator Dole's ardent supporters, Senator McCain, who's out there today, along with Senator Feingold, supported, sponsored a campaign finance reform proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	10176	I was able to do that in my state and bring these two together.	0
ClaimBuster	2067	And so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college.	0
ClaimBuster	10277	That's creating tens of thousands of jobs all across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	22867	That's what President Clinton did.	1
ClaimBuster	27496	In the meantime, though, we're not going to let up the pressure until we have clear evidence that that takes place.	0
ClaimBuster	2006	It's now four years later.	1
ClaimBuster	29065	Should I be fortunate enough to become your president, when I put my hand on the Bible, I will swear to not only uphold the laws of the land, but I will also swear to uphold the honor and the dignity of the office to which I have been elected, so help me God.	0
ClaimBuster	29967	In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it.	1
ClaimBuster	33197	There's other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	2160	On Social Security he's not.	0
ClaimBuster	18086	That wasn't going to work.	0
ClaimBuster	26762	I said I'm opposed to discrimination.	1
ClaimBuster	5896	And it's not the fact -- it's not the fact that Senator Obama chooses to associate with a guy who in 2001 said that he wished he had have bombed more, and he had a long association with him.	1
ClaimBuster	12257	And people are willing to invest capital in the brown fields don't want to do so for fear of lawsuit.	0
ClaimBuster	22861	And that's why we're doing what he suggested we do: Get the Brits, the Germans and the French to go make it very clear to the Iranians that if they expect to be a party to the world to give up their nuclear ambitions.	0
ClaimBuster	11787	I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do.	0
ClaimBuster	33096	This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election.	0
ClaimBuster	14664	That's why I think I'll win.	0
ClaimBuster	21459	And everything in there says what I am for.	0
ClaimBuster	22993	My opponent says he hadn't changed his position on it.	1
ClaimBuster	26204	That's what you like, you've got a perfect candidate.	0
ClaimBuster	25071	It is true over 10 years ago I voted to delay production of the F - 14, and I'll tell you why.	1
ClaimBuster	19576	But the bottom line is, we are the strongest nation in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	15516	He had two terms in the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	34072	And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election.	0
ClaimBuster	17651	We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before -- 2,300,000 more are receiving them -- even though we took 850,000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them.	1
ClaimBuster	6574	President Bush has taken -- he's the only president in history to do this.	1
ClaimBuster	8825	But, unlike Governor Reagan, I do not support a boondoggle like the MX missile.	1
ClaimBuster	22039	Why did our government do it?	0
ClaimBuster	3606	But the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we're going to get the middle class back on track.	0
ClaimBuster	9456	If you're getting interest from a bank, if you're getting a statement from a mutual fund or any other kind of investment you have, you don't have to worry about filing taxes on that, because there'll be no taxes for anybody making $200,000.00 per year and less, on your interest, dividends and capital gains.	1
ClaimBuster	16775	It's my - my opinion that the private sector, where five out of six jobs are, where you have permanent jobs, with the opportunity for advancement, is a better place than make-work jobs under the program recommended by the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	3592	Now, that's a fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	15042	I've done the same thing in the appointment of women, and also Spanish-speaking Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	34167	And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that.	1
ClaimBuster	21097	I want to get a better rate of return for your own money than the paltry 2% that the current Social Security Trust gets today.	0
ClaimBuster	12229	I think that in this 21st century we will soon see the consequences of what's called global warming.	0
ClaimBuster	23863	Personal income has dropped while people have worked harder.	1
ClaimBuster	28777	He is the chairman of the health committee.	1
ClaimBuster	3915	And right now, the commanders in Afghanistan, as well as Admiral Mullen, have acknowledged that we don't have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge.	1
ClaimBuster	9517	We can get this economy going again.	0
ClaimBuster	1399	And then I would like to appoint people who would be interested in helping with that.	0
ClaimBuster	28876	If you're a Medicare person, on Medicare, you don't get the new procedures.	1
ClaimBuster	15859	Rayburn says, yeah, and that guy never ran for sheriff either.	1
ClaimBuster	3191	Those are initiatives in foreign policy which are of the highest moral standard and that is indicative of the foreign policy of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	13657	His own analysis says that unemployment will be slightly higher in 1995 under his plan than it is today.	1
ClaimBuster	20927	First of all, most of good governance is at the state level.	0
ClaimBuster	33530	The Russians can't believe it.	0
ClaimBuster	1300	We've got a 30 percent or 40 percent unemployment rate among minority uh - young people.	1
ClaimBuster	28925	And in some cases may be still at large.	0
ClaimBuster	18768	The minute we have bilateral talks, the six-party talks will unwind.	0
ClaimBuster	7033	Twenty percent of the upper-income people pay about 80 percent of the taxes in America today because of how we structured the tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	11251	Energy is going to be key in dealing with Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	1546	We have cut inflation by better than half.	1
ClaimBuster	29803	I've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago.	1
ClaimBuster	28358	That was in an ad, Jim, that was knocked down by the journalists who analyzed the ad and said it was misleading.	1
ClaimBuster	18965	I look forward to discussing it more with him, as time goes on.	1
ClaimBuster	33467	If we got along well, that would be good.	0
ClaimBuster	22906	The president -- and this is one of the reasons why I am very proud in this race to have the support of General John Shalikashvili, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Admiral William Crowe, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; General Tony McPeak, who ran the air war for the president's father and did a brilliant job, supporting me; General Wes Clark, who won the war in Kosovo, supporting me; because they all -- and General Baca, who was the head of the National Guard, supporting me.	1
ClaimBuster	19328	I don't dislike trial lawyers.	0
ClaimBuster	23274	The president broke the pay-as-you-go rule.	1
ClaimBuster	3650	It had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies, I mean, billions of dollars worth.	1
ClaimBuster	25441	The Soviets try to spy on us, steal this stuff.	1
ClaimBuster	16671	As the economy improves, and it is improving, our gross national product this year will average about 6 percent increase over last year.	1
ClaimBuster	12889	Right under the Soviet gun, with Soviet troops there, he is in a very difficult position in taking anything independent, a position which would be independent of the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	5984	Obviously, we've got an immediate crisis right now.	0
ClaimBuster	18811	That happened long before I arrived in Washington, D.C.	1
ClaimBuster	26689	We just had a pretty serious dispute with China because they were copying our CDs, and costing thousands of jobs in places like California.	1
ClaimBuster	32444	Many of her friends took bigger deductions.	1
ClaimBuster	7504	We can have health care for all Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	15178	Now, to suggest that because two Republican presidents tried to pass the SALT treaty - that puts them on its side - I would like to say that President Ford, who was within 90% of a treaty that we could be in agreement with when he left office, is emphatically against this SALT treaty.	1
ClaimBuster	19850	So I don't want anybody out there to think we've just been voting no, no, no.	0
ClaimBuster	1217	Well, I might say that I think the League of Conservation Voters is absolutely right.	0
ClaimBuster	31855	This is a great country.	0
ClaimBuster	7249	The best way to take the pressure off our troops is to succeed in Iraq, is to train Iraqis so they can do the hard work of democracy, is to give them a chance to defend their country, which is precisely what we're doing.	1
ClaimBuster	24836	You can't be on one hand this way and one hand another.	0
ClaimBuster	6826	There's a -- no, look, there's a systemic problem.	0
ClaimBuster	21479	But the big argument I have with the governor on this is this taking different positions on different issues -- trying to be one thing to one person here that's opposing the NAFTA agreement and then for it -- what we call waffling.	1
ClaimBuster	29846	And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.	0
ClaimBuster	33983	... the money -- the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses -- the money that you're talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets.	1
ClaimBuster	25974	He went down and made a speech to people who were on his side saying that I did the wrong thing.	1
ClaimBuster	16233	In terms of negative campaigning, you know, I don't want to sound like a kid in the schoolyard: he started it.	0
ClaimBuster	33286	And I will stand up for that right.	0
ClaimBuster	20023	Let me say what I've said already about this pardon issue.	0
ClaimBuster	12168	And as the percentage of the population is increasing nationally, somehow the allegation that we don't care and we're going to give money for this interest or that interest and not for children in the State of Texas is totally absurd.	1
ClaimBuster	19368	We passed a bill in 1992 that encouraged the states to adopt programs to stop kids from smoking.	1
ClaimBuster	31941	So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is.	0
ClaimBuster	11306	And that's why I have consistently said that, if we can work more effectively with other countries diplomatically to tighten sanctions on Iran, if we can reduce our energy consumption through alternative energy, so that Iran has less money, if we can impose the kinds of sanctions that, say, for example, Iran right now imports gasoline, even though it's an oil-producer, because its oil infrastructure has broken down, if we can prevent them from importing the gasoline that they need and the refined petroleum products, that starts changing their cost-benefit analysis.	1
ClaimBuster	29139	With the United States, as he said, not so much.	1
ClaimBuster	8545	Too often in appraising whether we are moving ahead or not we think only of what the federal government is doing.	0
ClaimBuster	18445	I believe that it is important to tell the truth to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	2679	We drove our schools to be number one in the nation.	0
ClaimBuster	18056	Those words mean something to me, as somebody who has been in combat.	0
ClaimBuster	29791	Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets.	1
ClaimBuster	21480	And I do think that you can't turn the White House into the Waffle House.	0
ClaimBuster	25991	I've voted eight, ten times since 1965.	1
ClaimBuster	20772	The Strunk family in Allentown, Pennsylvania, I campaigned with them the other day.	1
ClaimBuster	19813	I didn't favor it when it was in, started.	0
ClaimBuster	28276	Well, the program that he's proposing is not the one that he just described.	1
ClaimBuster	25687	And you must ask yourself, do you know enough about the candidates?	0
ClaimBuster	975	We live-we bring everybody along.	0
ClaimBuster	8479	I would say, too, that when Senator Kennedy refers to the action of the House Rules Committee, there are eight Democrats on that committee and four Republicans.	1
ClaimBuster	6115	Here's the problem -- that for about 20 million people, you may find yourselves no longer having employer-based health insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	28522	But we have an opportunity -- we have an opportunity to use our research and development capacities, the great technology of the United States, to make our military lighter, harder to find, more lethal.	1
ClaimBuster	13879	As regarding Mr. Perot, I take back something I said about him.	0
ClaimBuster	33917	Well, it is an open discussion.	0
ClaimBuster	19351	We've done about all, we are the reform party, the Republican Party.	0
ClaimBuster	22196	The governors -- and I believe Governor Clinton was in on this -- but maybe -- I don't want to invoke him here.	0
ClaimBuster	8431	But, as Senator Kennedy said in January of this year in this same press conference, the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction, which means that all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers' salaries.	1
ClaimBuster	18641	Libya understood that America and others will enforce doctrine and that the world is better for it.	0
ClaimBuster	26953	We have to help these nations create civil societies.	0
ClaimBuster	16839	You can't hire a lobbyist uh out of unemployment compensation checks.	0
ClaimBuster	7785	It permits us to make sure that the projects which are invested in are going to produce greater wealth.	0
ClaimBuster	23198	I think we have an obligation to spend that kind of money.	0
ClaimBuster	27070	Secondly, Syria is an opportunity for us because Syria plays an important role in the Middle East, particularly right now.	0
ClaimBuster	29363	... or at an airport near you.	0
ClaimBuster	19326	We're the only two lawyers in Washington that trust each other.	0
ClaimBuster	3441	That's why I'm running for president, and that's what I hope we're going to be talking about tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	32310	Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands -- excuse me.	0
ClaimBuster	8465	It was killed in the Rules Committee.	1
ClaimBuster	5868	In fact, Mr. Ayers has become the centerpiece of Senator McCain's campaign over the last two or three weeks.	0
ClaimBuster	24652	And the president should lead a national effort to change behavior, to keep our children alive in the schools, responsible behavior to keep people alive.	0
ClaimBuster	12531	In the first place, they made a fatal error in misjudging the Communists; in trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world.	0
ClaimBuster	12400	I got some of the details wrong last week in some of the examples that I used, Jim, and I'm sorry about that.	1
ClaimBuster	27648	Now, that transition has to take place in a responsible fashion.	0
ClaimBuster	7975	But he has a responsibility to be accurate, and not to misstate the case.	0
ClaimBuster	28221	I happened to believe strong accountability encourages parental involvement, though.	0
ClaimBuster	1998	It's not the same as Simpson- Bowles.	0
ClaimBuster	1556	Thank you, and good night.	0
ClaimBuster	17088	As a matter of fact, it is the economic recovery program that we presented when I took office in 1981.	1
ClaimBuster	20788	Every middle class family is eligible for a tax cut under my proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	28219	I wish I knew the law that said all of us would be good parents.	0
ClaimBuster	22774	And that was unpopular, but it was the right thing to do.	0
ClaimBuster	6620	I went to Washington to solve problems.	1
ClaimBuster	10095	And to suggest -- am I incorrect in that regard, on Sunday, the -- your secretary --	0
ClaimBuster	6695	We created a 10 percent bracket to help lower-income Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	4358	And General Petraeus says we have had great success, but it's very fragile.	1
ClaimBuster	9512	For me, I look at what's happened in the last four years and say this has been a disappointment.	0
ClaimBuster	5685	And we are now looking at a deficit of well over half a trillion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	20338	I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think he will because under his plan if you work out the numbers Ã‚ $100 billion comes out of Medicare just for the wealthiest 1% in the tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	9666	And one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates and women are getting the same fair deal as men are.	0
ClaimBuster	161	Spending was only up something like 4 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	13765	And now we hear a lot of talk, oh, well, we all want enterprise zones, and yet the House and the Senate can't send it down without loading it up with a lot of, you know, these Christmas tree ornaments they put on the legislation.	0
ClaimBuster	28037	I want to come back and tell you why, but if you will forgive me, I would like to say something right now at the beginning of this debate following on the moment of silence for Mel Carnahan and Randy Carnahan and Chris Sifford.	0
ClaimBuster	7161	"But in return for extra spending, we now want people to measure -- states and local jurisdictions to measure to show us whether or not a child can read or write or add and subtract. """	0
ClaimBuster	16168	It's almost you remember that expression, get the lead out?	0
ClaimBuster	15867	They can't live in the community which they grew up in.	0
ClaimBuster	16005	So, I don't want to fool around with it.	0
ClaimBuster	33852	"About another woman, he said, ""That wouldn't be my first choice."""	1
ClaimBuster	1278	Let me say at the outset, uh - I'm very proud of the record of this administration.	0
ClaimBuster	32027	I didn't think I'd say this, but I'm going to say it, and I hate to say it.	0
ClaimBuster	29408	She's telling us how to fight ISIS.	1
ClaimBuster	30222	That's working with other nations.	0
ClaimBuster	33528	The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can't believe they allowed us to do this.	1
ClaimBuster	29014	There's just a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	24340	And we're more respected because of the way we have conducted ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	29692	We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	30194	I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?	0
ClaimBuster	827	If you do, you invite the taking of more hostages.	0
ClaimBuster	23414	I have a plan to cover those folks.	1
ClaimBuster	166	A capital gains differential will increase jobs, increase risk taking, increase revenues to the Federal Government.	0
ClaimBuster	10132	And so what I want is a -- is a comprehensive strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	141	And so let's kind of stay on the issue, and I have made a specific proposal for what I call a flexible freeze.	0
ClaimBuster	9540	Now, what he says is he's going to make sure that this doesn't add to the deficit and he's going to cut middleclass taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	4242	Because part of Russia's intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where President Saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that Putin favored more.	1
ClaimBuster	2301	Well, I would repeal and replace it.	0
ClaimBuster	6917	Now, what happens is when you begin to get people covered like that -- for instance in diabetes, if you diagnose diabetes early, you could save $50 billion in the health care system of America by avoiding surgery and dialysis.	1
ClaimBuster	9378	Those things will get us the energy we need.	0
ClaimBuster	2497	It was the largest expansion of private insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	20028	This is something I take seriously and that's my position.	0
ClaimBuster	21561	I've worked on these things for 12 years and I'm the only person up here who hasn't been part of Washington in any way for the last 20 years.	1
ClaimBuster	8768	I think that conservation - I think that a change in lifestyles - is necessary, and we had better begin to plan for that now rather than later.	0
ClaimBuster	7607	I hope some day it will rise; but I don't think it will rise if we continue the same policies toward Cuba that we did in recent years, and in fact towards all of Latin America - when we've almost ignored the needs of Latin America; we've beamed not a single Voice of America program in Spanish to all of Latin America in the last eight years, except for the three months of the Hungarian uh - revolution.	1
ClaimBuster	11828	And if you can't, there will be a federal consequence.	0
ClaimBuster	16154	We ought to move forward swiftly on my ideas of ethanol which would use more corn, and therefore, create a bigger market for our agricultural products.	1
ClaimBuster	1536	The American people had lost faith and trust and confidence in the presidency itself.	0
ClaimBuster	25315	Georgie Anne, we, believe me, supported the Simpson-Mazzoli bill strongly -- and the bill that came out of the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	1605	We've been drifting too long.	0
ClaimBuster	33199	And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them.	1
ClaimBuster	15466	I would like to have a crusade today, and I would like to lead that crusade with your help.	0
ClaimBuster	13850	And since then, for years, I have lived with the burden of the Middle East, where it's eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth country, in terms of their unhappiness with the fact that I was successful in that effort.	1
ClaimBuster	13680	If I make a mistake, I admit it.	0
ClaimBuster	28835	I'm against quotas, they're illegal.	0
ClaimBuster	12212	We're working hard to sign up children.	0
ClaimBuster	30410	And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet...	1
ClaimBuster	18625	But the enemy attacked us, Jim, and I have a solemn duty to protect the American people, to do everything I can to protect us.	1
ClaimBuster	16740	And some major uh - uh - manufacturing companies, like Dow Chemical, have through uh - very effective efficiency mechanism cut down the use of energy by uh - as much as 40 percent with the same out-product.	1
ClaimBuster	18818	Prior to Darfur, Ambassador Jack Danforth had been negotiating a north-south agreement that we would have hoped would have brought peace to the Sudan.	1
ClaimBuster	2315	Now, it wasn't just on Wall Street.	0
ClaimBuster	24394	But time is our friend there, because their leaders will change in not too many years, worst case, and their country is making great progress.	0
ClaimBuster	25881	We're down to 336 ships.	1
ClaimBuster	6805	People from both political parties came together in the halls of Congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice.	1
ClaimBuster	7863	Now that's an issue between Mr. Nixon and myself.	0
ClaimBuster	21321	We got to cut it out.	0
ClaimBuster	22158	We may differ about what the elements of that are.	0
ClaimBuster	9050	we're confronted with the horrendous problems that we've discussed here tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	14839	I've also learned that there are no simple answers to complicated questions.	0
ClaimBuster	7211	And that's what the No Child Left Behind Act does.	0
ClaimBuster	25853	If we're going to ask young men and young women to protect us and defend us around the world, and we've had more deployments under this administration than any time in history.	0
ClaimBuster	19764	It seemed to me the violence stopped when these leaders came to America.	0
ClaimBuster	11074	Well, let me just follow up, my friends.	0
ClaimBuster	18367	He called them coerced and the bribed.	1
ClaimBuster	33403	We're a country of laws.	0
ClaimBuster	872	I know that the people you pick make an enormous difference in your ability to govern and I set high standards.	0
ClaimBuster	11463	So we got to be guarded in our generosity.	0
ClaimBuster	32724	They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul.	1
ClaimBuster	3729	But John is right we have to make cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	6151	That's the choice you'll have is having your employer no longer provide you health care.	0
ClaimBuster	20849	Show us if they are learning to read, write, add and subtract and if so there will be bonus plans.	0
ClaimBuster	19348	Let's be honest about it.	0
ClaimBuster	15193	In addition to that, the adversarial relationship between ourselves and the Soviet Union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly.	0
ClaimBuster	15745	But there are limits to what we can spend.	0
ClaimBuster	27985	America's going to come back, and for that to happen, we're going to have to have a president who can work across the aisle.	0
ClaimBuster	24634	Then I would really focus on let's get these things out.	0
ClaimBuster	22006	And that is very important.	0
ClaimBuster	1191	So I think our selection uh - of Bob Dole as vice president uh - is based on merit.	0
ClaimBuster	9455	That makes life a lot easier.	0
ClaimBuster	8548	We have for example a gross national product of approximately five hundred billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	468	But no, I'm for the sanctity of life, and once that illegality is established, then we can come to grips with the penalty side, and of course there's got to be some penalties to enforce the law, whatever they may be.	0
ClaimBuster	33064	We've got to remain energy-independent.	0
ClaimBuster	9566	And then we have his own record, which is we have four consecutive years where he said when he was running for office, he would cut the deficit in half.	1
ClaimBuster	14068	We hammerlock the American companies -- American Airlines, Delta -- the last few great we have, because we're trying to do this deal with these 2 European companies.	1
ClaimBuster	16628	There's no way for our people now to understand what their government is.	0
ClaimBuster	27303	Well, Republicans and Democrats came together on a bipartisan basis to put in place education principles that focused on having great teachers in the classroom.	1
ClaimBuster	30277	I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it.	0
ClaimBuster	12585	Is our relative strength growing?	0
ClaimBuster	17751	And this is not personal -- there are deep differences about our future, and that's the basis of my campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	9030	I I think that, technically, I know this is a difficult and an emotional problem, and many people sincerely feel on both sides of this, but I do believe that maybe we could find the answer through medical evidence, if we would determine once and for all, is an unborn child a human being?	0
ClaimBuster	10317	If we're not training engineers to make sure that they are equipped here in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	860	And as a matter of fact, I think for most people the notion of President Quayle is a very very troubling thought.	0
ClaimBuster	26098	The trial lawyers, of course they like lawsuits, so every time they have a bill that they want vetoed, the president vetoes it for them.	1
ClaimBuster	10388	Because if they succeed, I believe the country succeeds.	0
ClaimBuster	3227	This is a leadership role that the United States under this administration is carrying out, and if we do it, and I think the opportunities and the possibilities are getting better, we will have solved many of the internal domestic problems that exist in South Korea at the present time.	0
ClaimBuster	11196	But we have to have a government that is responsive to the Afghan people, and, frankly, it's just not responsive right now.	0
ClaimBuster	14754	"The ""we"" is you and me."	0
ClaimBuster	5549	I think tax policy is a major difference between Senator McCain and myself.	0
ClaimBuster	34408	I will not cut benefits.	0
ClaimBuster	7661	So, under the circumstances, what do we do?	0
ClaimBuster	7304	Terrorists can now come into America and go to a gun show and, without even a background check, buy an assault weapon today.	1
ClaimBuster	25783	You do a lot of things nobody knows about.	0
ClaimBuster	27077	We don't want to get drawn into a military conflict.	0
ClaimBuster	27497	And one last thing -- just -- just to make this point.	0
ClaimBuster	6921	In all due respect, I'm not so sure it's credible to quote leading news organizations about -- oh, never mind.	0
ClaimBuster	17310	I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there.	0
ClaimBuster	2453	And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up -- it's true -- but they've gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years.	1
ClaimBuster	26018	This is a political year, and the President is playing politics with Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	30081	He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.	1
ClaimBuster	10088	Can you say that a little louder, Candy?	0
ClaimBuster	11660	We have to work with Nigeria.	0
ClaimBuster	33394	"He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: ""You complain, I'll get you deported."""	1
ClaimBuster	5718	You have to tell me one time when you have stood up with the leaders of your party on one single major issue.	0
ClaimBuster	31942	But it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.	1
ClaimBuster	22253	Well, the White House is a bully pulpit, and I think we ought to be pounding on the table every day.	0
ClaimBuster	9795	We just can't afford four more years like the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	6605	I sent up my budget man to the Congress, and he says, here's how we're going to reduce the deficit in half by five years.	1
ClaimBuster	33556	All I said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements, because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places.	1
ClaimBuster	13153	Now, we may not succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	1575	Our tax structure is a disgrace, it needs to be reformed.	0
ClaimBuster	24355	Now that the voices in the Congress and throughout the country have insisted that we do something about China, look at what has happened.	0
ClaimBuster	850	Well, when it comes to ridicule, George, you win a gold medal.	0
ClaimBuster	1826	But let's get at the bottom line.	0
ClaimBuster	15405	And I make it plain again: I am for women's rights.	0
ClaimBuster	23968	--notwithstanding my opponent's ad, my plan triggers in at gross incomes, family incomes of $200,000 and above.	1
ClaimBuster	32297	We are not at war with Islam.	1
ClaimBuster	26514	I hope not in both cases.	0
ClaimBuster	10041	And -- and I -- I think the president just said correctly that the buck does stop at his desk and -- and he takes responsibility for -- for that -- for the failure in providing those security resources, and -- and those terrible things may well happen from time to time.	0
ClaimBuster	29626	And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas.	1
ClaimBuster	21111	I would like to know from the governor -- I know we're not supposed to ask each other questions -- but I'd be interested in knowing, does that trillion dollars come from the trust fund, or does it come from the rest of the budget?	0
ClaimBuster	11768	And I think that there's a general agreement in many parts of the world now that there ought to be changes in the IMF.	0
ClaimBuster	32403	And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don't even know if it's accurate information, and then they put it out.	1
ClaimBuster	495	I think that part of it is the crime infested neighborhoods, and that's why I'm a strong believer in trying to control crimes in the neighborhood, why I was so pleased to be endorsed by the policemen on the beat, the Boston Police Department the other day.	1
ClaimBuster	4096	That will change when I'm president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	17686	I think the President genuinely believes that they're better off.	0
ClaimBuster	17153	"With regard to Social Security, I hope there'll be more time than just this minute to mention that, but I will say this: A President should never say ""never.''"	0
ClaimBuster	26629	I hope over the next ten years you will see a big increase over the percentage of people that have pension plans, plus a secure Social Security system.	0
ClaimBuster	15926	And that really is going to be a challenge for the next president of the United States; I don't think there's any question about it.	0
ClaimBuster	22622	So I tried diplomacy, went to the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	24857	We need to do better in job retraining.	0
ClaimBuster	7400	And the president and I have a difference of opinion about how we live out our sense of our faith.	0
ClaimBuster	15417	I've had to make thousands of decisions, and each one of those decisions has been a learning process.	1
ClaimBuster	21844	And my program is this.	0
ClaimBuster	7708	I believe the president of the United States should indicate it.	0
ClaimBuster	28396	Because the tax code is unfair for people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.	0
ClaimBuster	12584	The question is: are we moving in the direction of peace and security?	0
ClaimBuster	15786	Some of them are in public life in the Senate, the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	9288	That's not the right course for America.	0
ClaimBuster	22898	For instance, we're flying unmanned vehicles that can send real- time messages back to stations in the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	27954	And I've put forward a plan to make sure that we're bringing manufacturing jobs back to our shores by rewarding companies and small businesses that are investing here, not overseas.	1
ClaimBuster	18019	Forty-one percent of those 10 million are women.	1
ClaimBuster	795	He can talk about Iran/Contra and also-I'll make a deal with you, I will take the blame for those two incidents if you give me half the credit for all the good things that have happened in world peace since Ronald Reagan and I took over from the Carter administration.	0
ClaimBuster	26161	And if you have some of each -- and I have some age, some experience and some intelligence -- that adds up to wisdom.	0
ClaimBuster	24072	We're trying to solve it.	0
ClaimBuster	15774	You just don't make unilateral cuts in the naive hope that the Soviets are going to behave themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	16576	Pardon means that what you did, whether it's right or wrong, you're forgiven for it.	1
ClaimBuster	34068	So that is not the way our democracy works.	0
ClaimBuster	28126	But the best thing to do is to reform Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	2911	The American people don't know what those commitments are.	0
ClaimBuster	25841	These things are paid for in the balanced budget plan.	1
ClaimBuster	25416	That's why we say mutual and verifiable freezes.	0
ClaimBuster	19690	Was it the right thing to do?	0
ClaimBuster	25406	It might be an oil fire, it might be a jet exhaust, the computer might decide it's a missile -- and off we go.	0
ClaimBuster	7634	Second, he's wrong in the analogies that he makes.	0
ClaimBuster	8309	I think that this farm policy has failed.	0
ClaimBuster	15339	I think it is disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in Social Security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness, and they are receiving disability checks from Social Security every month while a state institution provides for all of their needs and their care.	1
ClaimBuster	24827	He was president for 3 years before he proposed a health care plan that still hasn't been sent to Congress in total; three years before an economic plan, and he still didn't say tonight that that tax bill he vetoed raised taxes only on the rich and gave the rest of you a break -- but he vetoed it anyway.	1
ClaimBuster	25329	And we work with those other countries.	0
ClaimBuster	28527	First thing I'm going to do is ask the Secretary of Defense to develop a plan so we are making sure we're not spending our money on political projects, but on projects to make sure our soldiers are well-paid, well-housed, and have the best equipment in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	21710	I think you put your finger on a major problem.	0
ClaimBuster	33411	But they're on line and they're waiting to become citizens.	1
ClaimBuster	6068	Well, it is a terribly painful situation for Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	10541	Well, Oliver, first, let me tell you what's in the rescue package for you.	0
ClaimBuster	3101	They must go hand in hand, but the security of this nation has got to come first.	0
ClaimBuster	21650	Now, results is what counts.	0
ClaimBuster	8789	Convention, the VFW National Convention - when I spoke to each of those bodies - I outlined a very specific program of increasing pay and allowances, reenlistment bonuses.	1
ClaimBuster	31918	We're going to have borders in our country, which we don't have now.	0
ClaimBuster	33079	And that's exactly what I have proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	15683	And we have two fundamentally different visions of America.	0
ClaimBuster	15355	This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party, as exemplified by the actions that I have taken in the Oval Office the last four years, as contrasted with Governor Reagan, who in most cases does typify his party, but in some cases, there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others.	0
ClaimBuster	25128	But we went in in the interest of peace and to keep Israel and Syria from getting into the sixth war between them.	1
ClaimBuster	20753	Imagine how many IRS agents it is going to take to be able to figure out his targeted tax cut for the middle class that excludes 50 million Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	20549	I don't favor a litmus test, but I know that there are ways to assess how a potential justice interprets the Constitution.	0
ClaimBuster	14305	And I am not apologetic at all about our record with women.	0
ClaimBuster	17489	But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped?	0
ClaimBuster	8201	Let's put it in terms that all of us can understand.	0
ClaimBuster	21668	Put those jobs in the inner cities instead of doing diplomatic deals and shipping them to China where prison labor does the work.	0
ClaimBuster	34231	OK, so it hasn't fallen.	0
ClaimBuster	13352	He could leave the parties in doubt as to which one he would use; and therefore there would be incentive, instead of as now - the steel companies were ready to take the strike because they felt the injunction of eighty days would break the union, which didn't happen.	1
ClaimBuster	3782	And I got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if there's anybody here who thinks there aren't agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	10475	As president of the United States, Alan, I would order the secretary of the treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in America and renegotiate at the new value of those homes -- at the diminished value of those homes and let people be able to make those -- be able to make those payments and stay in their homes.	0
ClaimBuster	3446	Senator Kennedy is in the hospital.	1
ClaimBuster	16348	So let's not be throwing stones about it.	0
ClaimBuster	12214	We're making really good progress.	0
ClaimBuster	6606	It requires pro-growth policies that grow our economy and fiscal sanity in the halls of Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	2099	But don't forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years' worth of breaks, into -- into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1.	1
ClaimBuster	19527	Now I understand it's been extended 'til some time next year.	1
ClaimBuster	16157	The farm payments are going down because the agricultural economy is coming back.	1
ClaimBuster	9519	Energy independence for North America in five years.	0
ClaimBuster	1660	Millions of jobs were lost, the auto industry was on the brink of collapse.	1
ClaimBuster	15518	He founded authored, the job training partnership act.	1
ClaimBuster	20528	Now that sounds to me a little bit different.	0
ClaimBuster	28800	But policies that give people a helping hand so they can help themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	32415	Look, now she's blaming -- she got caught in a total lie.	0
ClaimBuster	34129	And the only reason they did it is because she's running for the office of president and they want to look tough.	0
ClaimBuster	26258	That's not how America became the greatest country on the face of the earth.	0
ClaimBuster	16517	Within that sixty-billion dollars increase there would be fit the programs that I promised the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	24360	So I would be firm.	0
ClaimBuster	32103	And so please, go to...	0
ClaimBuster	14541	And then how about a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution?	0
ClaimBuster	2248	Is that a -- is that a separate topic?	0
ClaimBuster	29790	And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us.	0
ClaimBuster	1079	And the testimony under oath was to the effect that I did not talk to Mr. Nixon, to Mr. Haldeman, to Mr. Ehrlichman, or to any of the people at the White House.	1
ClaimBuster	27130	And we need to make sure they have the arms they need to carry out the very important role which is getting rid of Assad.	0
ClaimBuster	12814	I would say first of all that we must have in mind the fact that we have been negotiating to get tests inspected and uh - to get an agreement for many, many months.	1
ClaimBuster	3733	That was a give away and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works.	0
ClaimBuster	1665	And housing has begun to rise.	1
ClaimBuster	20877	They can't squeeze another desk in for her, so she has to stand during class.	0
ClaimBuster	2564	I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help.	0
ClaimBuster	33673	That's the kind of approach that will work.	0
ClaimBuster	13838	At the point when I could not get them to address those problems, I had created so much stress in the board, who wanted to just keep the Lawrence Welk music going, that they asked to buy my remaining shares.	1
ClaimBuster	29711	And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country.	1
ClaimBuster	15810	And there's nothing corny about having sports heroes, young people that are clean and honorable and out there setting the pace.	0
ClaimBuster	24464	I believe that discipline and respect for the law -- all of these things should be taught to children, not in our schools, but families have to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	3946	It's not just more troops.	0
ClaimBuster	33540	I -- I find it ironic that he's raising nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	1822	Now, you cite a study.	1
ClaimBuster	16142	Well, let me take him up on this question of farm subsidies.	0
ClaimBuster	2527	And then that number disappears for high-income people.	1
ClaimBuster	17577	[Laughter] I don't have a plan to tax -- or increase taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	22464	Now, just remember when you think about me -- I didn't create this mess.	0
ClaimBuster	15225	We will drill more oil and gas wells this year than any year in history.	0
ClaimBuster	9138	When I was governor of Massachusetts, to get a high school degree, you had to pass an exam.	1
ClaimBuster	33359	When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president.	1
ClaimBuster	28766	I don't think it's the issues that turn kids off.	0
ClaimBuster	29113	And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work.	0
ClaimBuster	19260	My balanced budget plan puts ten years on the Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	623	We will do what we do best.	0
ClaimBuster	9805	He said in his first year he'd put out an immigration plan that would deal with our immigration challenges.	1
ClaimBuster	17368	Well, tonight we had the first debate over the deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	9933	He said the standard bearer wasn't for it.	1
ClaimBuster	10549	Let's, first of all, understand that the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system.	0
ClaimBuster	9421	It's critical to our future.	0
ClaimBuster	33855	He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like.	0
ClaimBuster	18578	We have to start to spend the money now.	0
ClaimBuster	17414	The year that he decided we had lost our way was the year that John F. Kennedy was running against Richard Nixon.	1
ClaimBuster	13023	But we aren't going to move America forward and we aren't going to be able to lead the world to win this struggle for freedom if we have a permanent inferiority complex about American achievements.	0
ClaimBuster	12516	How can we extend freedom - extend it without war?	0
ClaimBuster	32032	There has never been anything like this, where e-mails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.	1
ClaimBuster	5772	I hope that Senator Obama will repudiate those remarks that were made by Congressman John Lewis, very unfair and totally inappropriate.	0
ClaimBuster	19158	I guess I rely more on the individual.	0
ClaimBuster	15848	And I would cite again Dan Quayle.	0
ClaimBuster	12769	I've served this country for fourteen years in the Congress and before that in the service.	1
ClaimBuster	18526	I've laid out a plan by which I think we can be successful in Iraq: with a summit, by doing better training, faster, by cutting -- by doing what we need to do with respect to the U.N. and the elections.	1
ClaimBuster	6800	I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters.	0
ClaimBuster	25388	And the thought that we would share this with the Soviet Union is, in my opinion, a total non-STARTer.	0
ClaimBuster	7482	"""Those are the three words that she left me with."	1
ClaimBuster	2815	And that's one of the major issues in this uh - campaign of 1976.	0
ClaimBuster	9069	We have disagreed, I believe, on virtually every other issue.	0
ClaimBuster	3461	We have to -- it has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it.	0
ClaimBuster	2483	In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don't need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have.	0
ClaimBuster	19406	The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana, and I regret it.	1
ClaimBuster	6008	He said, we will look at offshore drilling.	1
ClaimBuster	11994	I think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively.	0
ClaimBuster	10152	The opportunities that the child will -- will be able to achieve increase dramatically.	0
ClaimBuster	1282	Uh - the Department of uh - uh - HUD is enforcing the new legislation that uhh - outlaws, that takes care of redlining.	1
ClaimBuster	24717	So hold the line on Social Security and put a cap on the growth of the mandatory program.	0
ClaimBuster	11523	We don't know -- there are no inspectors now in Iraq, the coalition that was in place isn't as strong as it used to be.	1
ClaimBuster	23665	It's clear for everybody to see.	0
ClaimBuster	33717	I've visited so many communities.	1
ClaimBuster	12068	Love your neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself.	0
ClaimBuster	10019	I send them there, oftentimes into harm's way.	1
ClaimBuster	19357	We couldn't get it done, because I wasn't enforceable.	0
ClaimBuster	12963	Mr. Nixon said that we should not regard them as pawns in the cold war; we should identify ourselves with them.	1
ClaimBuster	17743	Do you want to give me some suggestions?	0
ClaimBuster	25583	I want to thank the League of Women Voters, the good citizens of Kansas City, and President Reagan for agreeing to debate this evening.	0
ClaimBuster	1734	High-income people are doing just fine in this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	33375	Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.	1
ClaimBuster	22563	But the president has underfunded it by $28 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	34140	Going to be more deaths that they thought.	0
ClaimBuster	18643	I think by acting firmly and decisively, it will mean it is less likely we have to use force.	0
ClaimBuster	6319	I'm sure you're aware, Senator Obama, of the program in the Washington, D.C., school system where vouchers are provided and there's a certain number, I think it's a thousand and some and some 9,000 parents asked to be eligible for that.	1
ClaimBuster	18645	Jim, the president just said something extraordinarily revealing and frankly very important in this debate.	0
ClaimBuster	31988	Four of them here tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	14063	One of the largest industries in the world is the travel and tourist business.	1
ClaimBuster	30389	She's got experience, but it's bad experience.	0
ClaimBuster	23429	Secondly, allow small businesses to pool together so they can share risk and buy insurance at the same discounts big businesses get to do.	0
ClaimBuster	23699	But history will look back, and I'm fully prepared to accept any mistakes that history judges to my administration, because the president makes the decisions, the president has to take the responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	26910	Of course we see in Syria, 30,000 civilians having been killed by the military there.	1
ClaimBuster	2686	What's happening in the Middle East, there are developments around the world that are of real concern.	0
ClaimBuster	18679	The world is more dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	183	I believe that's the answer.	0
ClaimBuster	21259	Because you are the ones who have the hardest time paying taxes, the hardest time making ends meet.	0
ClaimBuster	29793	We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.	0
ClaimBuster	10881	What Senator McCain doesn't mention is he's been there 26 of them.	1
ClaimBuster	22855	"He keeps talking about, ""Let the inspectors do their job."""	0
ClaimBuster	28380	I wish we could spend an hour talking about trusting people.	0
ClaimBuster	17759	Yes, we have a $263 billion deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	15725	Everybody knows that including the people at the Pentagon.	0
ClaimBuster	23168	And I want to talk about my plan some more -- I hope we can.	0
ClaimBuster	4117	Of course we've got to do preparations, starting with low-level diplomatic talks, and it may not work, because Iran is a rogue regime.	0
ClaimBuster	20273	I agree that the surplus is the American people's money, it's your money.	0
ClaimBuster	26717	The president has a great responsibility.	1
ClaimBuster	5889	Those are the people, Democrats and Republicans, who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	21445	We'll be on again Saturday night, 8 to 9 o'clock on ABC.	1
ClaimBuster	28491	The United States has to be strong in order to make sure that we can help promote peace and security and stability.	0
ClaimBuster	27913	Having a tax code that rewards companies that are shipping jobs overseas instead of companies that are investing here in the United States, that will not make us more competitive.	0
ClaimBuster	23995	And so I just have a different approach.	0
ClaimBuster	12638	I have seen Communist influence and Castro influence rise in Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	7945	We're not able to consume what we're able to produce at a time when the Soviet Union is making great economic gains.	1
ClaimBuster	17964	And we admire your pluck and perseverance.	0
ClaimBuster	24302	And we've focused on the tactical.	0
ClaimBuster	17667	That had nothing to do with the other thing of talking about their needs or anything.	0
ClaimBuster	1039	So both those extremes grasp for advantage and the person who has to pay that expense is the middle-income family who's still working for a living and they have to pay for the rich who have privilege, and for the poor who are not working.	0
ClaimBuster	8795	Mr. Corddry, it's a shame now that there are only two of us here debating, because the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement on this particular issue, and the only one who would be disagreeing with us is the President, if he were present.	0
ClaimBuster	5982	I think that's about a realistic timeframe.	0
ClaimBuster	10643	My friends, do we need to spend that kind of money?	0
ClaimBuster	13084	And therefore on this question I don't think that there is any doubt in the mind of any American; I hope there is not any doubt in the mind of any member of the community of West Berlin; I'm sure there isn't any doubt in the mind of the Russians.	0
ClaimBuster	8865	All have to do is agree to refurbish it, make it habitable, and live in it - just as 100 or more years ago, we did with the open land in this country - urban .	0
ClaimBuster	33975	They put up the American flag.	0
ClaimBuster	22744	Now we have to succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	10129	Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago, there's an awful lot of violence and they're not using AK-47s.	1
ClaimBuster	11794	Mr. Putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries and/or entities invest capital, there's a reasonable rate of return, a way to get the money out of the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	30384	We have made so many bad deals during the last -- so she's got experience, that I agree.	0
ClaimBuster	31839	Yes, I think that that's a very good question, because I've heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	1656	There are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me.	1
ClaimBuster	57	Doing better in the neighborhoods.	0
ClaimBuster	27388	We're headed down to the low 200s if we go through a sequestration.	0
ClaimBuster	19446	I know what it's like to see somebody you love nearly lose their lives, and I hate drugs, Senator.	0
ClaimBuster	2369	So it's adding to cost.	1
ClaimBuster	6276	Parents are going to have to show more responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	20291	I've got a plan on Medicare, for example, that's a two-stage plan that says we'll have immediate help for seniors and what I call immediate Helping Hand, a $48 billion program.	1
ClaimBuster	20733	I think we have to invest in education, protecting the environment, health care, a prescription drug benefit that goes to all seniors, not just to the poor, under Medicare, not relying on HMOs and insurance companies.	0
ClaimBuster	14148	He got a notice or he didn't.	0
ClaimBuster	14291	I think the woman that works with me, Rose Zamaria, is about as tough as a boot out there and makes some discipline and protects the taxpayer.	0
ClaimBuster	27371	I'm pleased that I've balanced budgets.	1
ClaimBuster	10673	There's no -- and we have to do them all at once.	0
ClaimBuster	26119	We've got home ownership at a 15-year high.	1
ClaimBuster	32594	Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system.	1
ClaimBuster	16963	You are familiar, of course, with the fact that I am the first president in thirty years who has reorganized the intelligence agencies in the federal government: the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the others.	1
ClaimBuster	18118	He doesn't want U.S. leadership, however, to send mixed signals, to not stand with the Iraqi people.	0
ClaimBuster	32248	We're going to block grant into the states.	0
ClaimBuster	18359	That's not a grand coalition.	0
ClaimBuster	16076	And yet Mr. Bush tried to cut their cost of living increase in 1985.	1
ClaimBuster	9634	We're still down 580,000 jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	21739	Brady Bill, I agree that it's a timid step in the right direction but it won't fix it.	0
ClaimBuster	28909	There have been some tough cases come across my desk.	0
ClaimBuster	16912	Well, it's not a matter of uh - Republican and Democrat.	0
ClaimBuster	15659	I think my dad would be pretty proud of me, because I think we've come a long long way and I think, you know three months ago, I remember some of the great publications in this country had written me off.	0
ClaimBuster	26462	Now, for four years that's what I worked on.	1
ClaimBuster	201	Well, no, it's no answer to those 37 million people, most of them members of working families who don't have a dime of health insurance and don't know how to pay the bills if their kids get sick at night.	1
ClaimBuster	12012	One of the reasons we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have a gun or not.	0
ClaimBuster	6543	We're going to let everybody buy into the same health-care plan senators and congressmen give themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	13634	Our challenge is to stop the financial bleeding.	0
ClaimBuster	10228	This is the way we're going to create jobs in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	23441	It encourages the use of renewables like ethanol and biodiesel.	0
ClaimBuster	2753	We'll put in place the kind of principles that I put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured and we'll focus on getting the cost of health care down.	0
ClaimBuster	17149	And, as a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history took place 1977.	1
ClaimBuster	1767	If I'm president, I'll double them, and also get the -- the oil from offshore and Alaska.	0
ClaimBuster	33042	But we are putting our energy companies out of business.	1
ClaimBuster	28772	And I came to the conclusion that our love was strong enough to be able to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	20024	This is an issue they've brought up.	1
ClaimBuster	6858	Medicare is paid for by the American taxpayer.	1
ClaimBuster	22049	They just write a note for the interest.	0
ClaimBuster	15276	We have, with our five-year plan for the leasing of offshore lands, proposed more land to be drilled than has been opened up for drilling since this program first started in 1954.	1
ClaimBuster	10754	And so part of the problem, I think, for a lot of people who are listening here tonight is they don't feel as if they are sharing the burden with other folks.	0
ClaimBuster	16152	And we ought to expand our markets abroad.	0
ClaimBuster	25813	Well, first, let me say there you go again, Mr. President, talking about a Medicare cut.	0
ClaimBuster	22311	We have a big program in my state that teaches mothers or fathers to teach their kids to get ready for school.	1
ClaimBuster	747	We've got to treat it as international crime.	0
ClaimBuster	2875	And his own uh - Office of Management and Budget testified that he had a $3 billion cut insurance added to the defense budget - defense budget under the pressure from the Pentagon.	1
ClaimBuster	30251	Nuclear is the single greatest threat.	0
ClaimBuster	15312	Well, that just isn't true.	0
ClaimBuster	15298	But it's going to take some study and some work, and not just passing a tax increase to let the load - or the roof - fall in on the next administration.	0
ClaimBuster	2534	That's part of my health care plan.	1
ClaimBuster	5738	Let me just say, Bob.	0
ClaimBuster	26228	We've opened 260,000 new jobs in the military to women since I've been president.	1
ClaimBuster	2553	That doesn't restrict people's freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	6127	Now, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, and you will then fall into the category where you'll have to pay a fine if you don't provide health insurance that Senator Obama mandates, not the kind that you think is best for your family, your children, your employees, but the kind that he mandates for you.	1
ClaimBuster	23503	I met a man who spent eight months in prison, wasn't even allowed to call his lawyer, wasn't allowed to get -- finally, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois intervened and was able to get him out.	1
ClaimBuster	1569	A lot remains to be done.	0
ClaimBuster	10108	I'm happy to do that, too.	0
ClaimBuster	5981	I think that in ten years, we can reduce our dependence so that we no longer have to import oil from the Middle East or Venezuela.	0
ClaimBuster	21151	It's not good for the country and it's not right.	0
ClaimBuster	16559	Mr. Nixon resigned, and I became president.	1
ClaimBuster	27678	But we're going to have to work with the -- with the people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that they're on.	0
ClaimBuster	27671	Pakistan is -- is technically an ally, and they're not acting very much like an ally right now.	0
ClaimBuster	5791	The notion, though, that because we're not doing town hall meetings that justifies some of the ads that have been going up, not just from your own campaign directly, John, but 527s and other organizations that make some pretty tough accusations, well, I don't mind being attacked for the next three weeks.	0
ClaimBuster	21563	I worked 12 years very hard as a governor on the real problems of real people.	1
ClaimBuster	14232	How do you get anything done when you've got all of these political action committees, all of these thousands of registered lobbyists -- 40,000 registered lobbyists, 23,000 special interest groups -- and the list goes on and on and on.	1
ClaimBuster	3614	I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in -- in the United States of America and create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	14244	And that's a whole lot different from these fellows running up and down the halls whispering in their ears now and promising campaign funds for the next election if they do it.	0
ClaimBuster	33892	And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what's at stake in this election.	0
ClaimBuster	17810	I did support the '76 measure that he told about, because we were in a deep recession and we needed some stimulation.	1
ClaimBuster	27962	I will fight for your families and I will work every single day to make sure that America continues to be the greatest nation on earth.	0
ClaimBuster	9678	I just want to make sure that, I think I was supposed to get that last answer, but I want to point out that that I don't believe...	0
ClaimBuster	21818	I've recommended that our doctors be given a set of national practice guidelines and that if they follow those guidelines that raises the presumption that they didn't do anything wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	29326	You were totally in favor of it.	1
ClaimBuster	17119	I respect the President; I respect the Presidency, and I think he knows that.	0
ClaimBuster	7077	See, the card, it'll have a period of time attached to it.	0
ClaimBuster	9817	The entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	26972	Then you said we should.	1
ClaimBuster	7286	To me, that's the best way to secure America.	0
ClaimBuster	17221	We have preserved the safety net for the people with true need in this country, and it has been pure demagoguery that we have in some way shut off all the charitable programs or many of them for the people who have real need.	0
ClaimBuster	22800	I came away convinced that, if we worked at it, if we were ready to work and letting Hans Blix do his job and thoroughly go through the inspections, that if push came to shove, they'd be there with us.	0
ClaimBuster	19741	Maybe that was the purpose.	0
ClaimBuster	10219	The place where we've seen manufacturing go has been China.	1
ClaimBuster	11215	But have no doubt that Russia's behavior is certainly outside the norms of behavior that we would expect for nations which are very wealthy, as Russia has become, because of their petro dollars.	0
ClaimBuster	28365	We just have a different philosophy.	0
ClaimBuster	927	But let's not go back to that-what they call supply management and production control, that'll simply price us out of the international market.	0
ClaimBuster	6205	We tried to overturn it in the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	1763	But not due to his policies.	0
ClaimBuster	20610	And the people of Serbia know that they can escape all those sanctions if this guy is turned out of power.	0
ClaimBuster	25692	And I think first you should -- I should understand that the question on your mind is do I understand your problem.	0
ClaimBuster	10046	There were many days that passed before we knew whether this was a spontaneous demonstration, or actually whether it was a terrorist attack.	0
ClaimBuster	23008	These terrorists are serious, they're deadly, and they know nothing except trying to kill.	0
ClaimBuster	3976	And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they don't want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements.	1
ClaimBuster	19425	The record is pretty clear in Arkansas, when you were governor.	1
ClaimBuster	33022	I think it's such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration.	1
ClaimBuster	30216	I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough.	1
ClaimBuster	25787	We try to help people with disabilities.	0
ClaimBuster	19185	And it seems to me that if you take a look, are you better off?	0
ClaimBuster	24784	Well, it's been a privilege to be able to talk to the American people tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	16578	I think it's accurate to say that in uh - two years ago when Mr. Nixon - Mr. Ford put in this uh amnesty that three times as many deserters were uh - excused as were - as were the uh - the ones who evaded the draft.	1
ClaimBuster	13131	I suggest that if Formosa is attacked or the Pescadores, or if there's any military action in any area which indicates an attack on Formosa and the Pescadores, then of course the United States is at war to defend its treaty.	0
ClaimBuster	13300	I do not suggest that Mr. Nixon does in any way.	0
ClaimBuster	7880	And I believe this Administration has not met its responsibilities in the last eight years, that our power relative to that of the Communists is declining, that we're facing a very hazardous time in the sixties, and unless the United States begin to move here - unless we start to go ahead - I don't believe that we're going to meet our responsibility to our own people or to the cause of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	11207	He still will not admit that he was wrong about the strategy of the surge in Iraq, and that's the same kind of strategy of go out and secure and hold and allow people to live normal lives.	0
ClaimBuster	7020	The jobs the president is creating pay $9,000 less than the jobs that we're losing.	1
ClaimBuster	12469	No child should be left behind in America.	0
ClaimBuster	28767	I think it's the tone.	0
ClaimBuster	12822	I think that the next president immediately after his election should sit down with the President, work out a timetable, and - get a decision on this before January of next year.	0
ClaimBuster	13194	The Senate was right because they knew the lesson of history.	0
ClaimBuster	2633	And for us to be able to make sure that they've got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids.	0
ClaimBuster	13925	And I finally -- I thought I didn't understand it -- called all the experts, and they said, oh, it'll be disruptive for 12 to 15 years.	1
ClaimBuster	34171	But what's really important here is to understand all the interplay.	0
ClaimBuster	19270	This is not a Wall Street tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	19480	And I think his present position is he would not do so, and if that's true I'm grateful for it.	0
ClaimBuster	5692	And let me tell you...	0
ClaimBuster	8623	I think we're ready to move.	0
ClaimBuster	9439	You've seen, as middle-income people in this country, incomes go down $4,300 a family, even as gasoline prices have gone up $2,000.	1
ClaimBuster	33080	I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.	0
ClaimBuster	15796	But more than that, they are role models.	0
ClaimBuster	8020	To leave this rather in the air, that we will defend it under some conditions but not under other, I think is a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	491	I think it is good.	0
ClaimBuster	32690	I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS.	1
ClaimBuster	17717	And I haven't got time to answer with regard to the disabled.	0
ClaimBuster	2226	We have to make sure this program is there for the long term.	0
ClaimBuster	22026	Then out of that debate, with leadership, comes consensus.	0
ClaimBuster	11481	They are historic, they are strong, and they are enduring.	0
ClaimBuster	34282	But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees.	0
ClaimBuster	12916	And so I would hope that Senator Kennedy in his answer today would clear it up.	0
ClaimBuster	18353	And Colin Powell helped set up that summit.	1
ClaimBuster	7871	I think in many ways this election is more important than any since 1932, or certainly almost any in this century.	0
ClaimBuster	6662	You get to defer your taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	26054	So I know what it's like to have to look welfare head-on.	0
ClaimBuster	3280	The White House did not uh - prevent the release of that report.	1
ClaimBuster	6049	Look, as I travel around the country, this is the issue that will break your heart over and over again.	0
ClaimBuster	441	And I favor the death penalty.	0
ClaimBuster	15024	We've had a 73% increase in the allotment of Federal funds for improved education.	1
ClaimBuster	5716	I have fought against special interests.	1
ClaimBuster	5735	And I think the American people understand it hasn't worked.	0
ClaimBuster	4304	I think it -- that we have a safer nation, but we are a long way from safe.	0
ClaimBuster	25010	One is the Middle East, and that is of interest to the whole Western World and the industrialized nations, because of the great supply of energy upon which so many depend there.	0
ClaimBuster	5751	Senator Obama, your argument for standing up to the leadership of your party isn't very convincing.	0
ClaimBuster	5932	She understands that better than almost any American that I know.	0
ClaimBuster	24830	I want the future of this country to be as bright and brilliant as its past, and it can be if we have the courage to change.	0
ClaimBuster	11793	They're going to have to make the decision themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	22483	Our schools are now better.	0
ClaimBuster	11398	When it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question.	0
ClaimBuster	17851	"And I believe the answer to that has to also be ""yes.''"	0
ClaimBuster	32537	I know many of her donors.	0
ClaimBuster	30008	That just happened, and many more are coming.	1
ClaimBuster	16199	George, we have supply management today under the 1985 bill.	1
ClaimBuster	31940	We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.	1
ClaimBuster	15927	But I also see a tremendous opportunity now to negotiate with the Soviet Union to build on the progress that we've made with the INF Treaty, which I strongly supported and most Democrats did to get those reductions in strategic weapons, to get a test ban treaty, and to really make progress on the reduction of conventional forces in Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	16230	Now we've got three of them.	1
ClaimBuster	29636	We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses.	1
ClaimBuster	9677	And I appreciate that question.	0
ClaimBuster	21327	That's a scare tactic, because it's not that many.	0
ClaimBuster	7702	We are a goldfish bowl before the world.	0
ClaimBuster	10619	And what I've proposed, you'll hear Senator McCain say, well, he's proposing a whole bunch of new spending, but actually I'm cutting more than I'm spending so that it will be a net spending cut.	1
ClaimBuster	19652	Most people want to see their own doctor.	0
ClaimBuster	28647	And under the plan that I've proposed, 80% of all family farms will be completely exempt from the estate tax.	1
ClaimBuster	16554	About fourteen to fifteen thousand did take advantage of that program.	1
ClaimBuster	25437	Well, that's what a President's supposed to know -- where those weapons are going to be.	0
ClaimBuster	28146	You go to your own pharmacy and then Medicare pays half the price.	1
ClaimBuster	13003	And this means more than what we've been doing.	0
ClaimBuster	22588	He said he voted for the $87 billion, and voted against it right before he voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	4188	Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable.	0
ClaimBuster	34302	And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don't want the cease-fire anymore.	1
ClaimBuster	31955	I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.	1
ClaimBuster	12272	If you own the land, every day is Earth Day.	0
ClaimBuster	22623	But as we learned in the same report I quoted, Saddam Hussein was gaming the oil-for-food program to get rid of sanctions.	1
ClaimBuster	10094	It took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group.	0
ClaimBuster	24384	They didn't go over to coddle.	0
ClaimBuster	12626	The question which we have to decide as Americans - are we doing enough today?	0
ClaimBuster	28913	And did the person have full access to the courts of law?	0
ClaimBuster	16296	Well, it's a great concern of mine and I think of all Americans, and perhaps the vice president can tell us what's been going on.	0
ClaimBuster	23601	Will women's rights be protected?	0
ClaimBuster	21918	Nobody's been luckier than I've been, all the way across the spectrum, and the greatest riches of all are my wife and children.	0
ClaimBuster	10978	We've got to give them the wherewithal to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	27991	This nation is the hope of the earth.	0
ClaimBuster	33193	But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	9630	Let's have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you.	0
ClaimBuster	15391	If I were President, I would also now take a look at the hundreds of Federal regulations which discriminate against women and which go right on while everyone is looking for an amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	23221	That's the way we leave it.	0
ClaimBuster	10941	Now, Senator McCain has a different kind of approach.	1
ClaimBuster	28658	Again, this is just a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	6839	Thirdly, one of the reasons why there's still high cost in medicine is because this is -- they don't use any information technology.	1
ClaimBuster	20894	We've done a long way working together to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	10047	And there was no demonstration involved.	1
ClaimBuster	23434	You get a catastrophic plan to help you on it.	0
ClaimBuster	15900	I know others disagree with it.	0
ClaimBuster	17896	Will we be better off if we start this star wars escalation into the heavens?	0
ClaimBuster	20691	Look, that's where World War I started in the Balkans.	1
ClaimBuster	34180	It's going to be tough fighting.	0
ClaimBuster	24454	And I think they deserve a family and medical leave act.	0
ClaimBuster	15228	And we have an opportunity now with improved transportation systems and improved loading facilities in our ports, to see a very good opportunity on a world international market, to replace OPEC oil with American coal as a basic energy source.	1
ClaimBuster	15593	That's not what we are going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	3565	But let's be clear: Earmarks account for $18 billion in last year's budget.	1
ClaimBuster	25459	Why I disagree with the MX is that it's a sitting duck.	0
ClaimBuster	29983	But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states.	1
ClaimBuster	7239	But the most important thing to relieve the pressure on all of the armed forces is frankly to run a foreign policy that recognizes that America is strongest when we are working with real alliances, when we are sharing the burdens of the world by working through our statesmanship at the highest levels and our diplomacy to bring other nations to our side.	0
ClaimBuster	19015	Thank you very much to the university, again.	0
ClaimBuster	33190	I represented upstate New York.	1
ClaimBuster	11329	I came from very modest means.	1
ClaimBuster	819	The Vice President ignored them.	1
ClaimBuster	28439	I've got a strategy for the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	22635	I'm also going to talk -- respond to what you asked, Cheryl, at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	29104	First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.	0
ClaimBuster	25854	Fifty times we deployed troops around the world.	1
ClaimBuster	29995	But we will defend the citizens of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	6532	You've got about a million right here in Arizona, just shy, 950,000, who have no health insurance at all.	1
ClaimBuster	10601	There is a lot of blame to go around.	0
ClaimBuster	15019	That's one of the main reasons that we've had such an increase in the number of people employed.	1
ClaimBuster	26944	The right course for us is to make sure that we go after the -- the people who are leaders of these various anti-American groups and these -- these jihadists, but also help the Muslim world.	0
ClaimBuster	24813	We owe you a debt we can never repay you.	0
ClaimBuster	11482	And our ability to serve as an honest broker is something that we need to shepherd.	0
ClaimBuster	3765	Not only -- Even if we get all $700 billion back, let's assume the markets recover, we're holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit.	1
ClaimBuster	429	You know, the vice president says he wants to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers, and yet his administration has a federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the country, which gave last year 7,000 furloughs to drug traffickers and drug pushers, the same people that he says he now wants to execute.	1
ClaimBuster	21884	You've got to reassert your ownership in this country and you've got to completely reform our government.	0
ClaimBuster	17626	And, no, I never proposed any $20 billion should come out of Medicare; I have proposed that the program we must treat with that particular problem.	1
ClaimBuster	23339	Off-road diesel engines -- we have reached an agreement to reduce pollution from off-road diesel engines by 90 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	11031	So we are peacemakers and we're peacekeepers.	0
ClaimBuster	25109	First of all, when we and our allies -- the Italians, the French, and the United Kingdom -- went into Lebanon, we went in there at the request of what was left of the Lebanese Government to be a stabilizing force while they tried to establish a government.	1
ClaimBuster	14659	I don't think we're a declining nation.	0
ClaimBuster	12029	I am for licensing by states of new handgun purchases.	0
ClaimBuster	19306	And I told the people exactly what the Congress exactly what kind of bill I would sign.	1
ClaimBuster	21012	The difference is we've got a new policy.	1
ClaimBuster	2522	I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families.	0
ClaimBuster	22962	I agree with the president that we have to go after them and get them wherever they are.	0
ClaimBuster	33992	So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire.	1
ClaimBuster	12646	The average income in some of those countries is twenty-five dollars a year.	1
ClaimBuster	25461	It puts a hair-trigger, and it is a dangerous, destabilizing weapon.	0
ClaimBuster	15855	So I salute these things.	0
ClaimBuster	20134	We have the right approach for the future and looks at the results.	0
ClaimBuster	3076	We have a higher unemployment rate in this country than Great Britain, and West Germany.	1
ClaimBuster	643	But I don't think we need these other systems.	0
ClaimBuster	24791	The people in Washington are good people.	0
ClaimBuster	24196	By the time Congress comes into session to go to work, have those plans ready to go in front of Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	29230	We have to stop them from leaving.	0
ClaimBuster	28277	Described under your plan, Governor Bush, states would be required to pay vouchers to students to match the vouchers so that the federal government would put up.	1
ClaimBuster	12975	I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in Europe and Italy and the Pacific for freedom in World War II have now taken over in the United States, and that they're going to put this country back to work again.	0
ClaimBuster	29665	My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies.	0
ClaimBuster	5733	But when it comes to economic policies, essentially what you're proposing is eight more years of the same thing.	0
ClaimBuster	8025	I think that uh - we should protect our commitments.	0
ClaimBuster	20098	I've seen the tough times, I know they can be better and I'll lead America to a brighter future.	0
ClaimBuster	16518	I might say too, that - that if we see that these goals cannot be reached - and I believe they're reasonable goals - then I would cut back on the rate of implement- implementation of new programs in order to accommodate a balanced budget by fiscal year '81 which is the last year of the next term.	0
ClaimBuster	26040	We need to reform it.	0
ClaimBuster	33545	He said, well, if we have them, why don't we use them, which I think is terrifying.	1
ClaimBuster	4107	First of all, Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	23378	They're going backwards on the water quality.	1
ClaimBuster	2334	That's why I'd have regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	16618	For instance, we uh - completely revised our prison system.	1
ClaimBuster	15708	I think we can say, through the Packard Commission Report and I'm very proud that David Packard, the originator of that report, is strongly supporting me.	1
ClaimBuster	423	I'm opposed to the death penalty.	0
ClaimBuster	18916	And I intend to get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	27812	Nothing could be further from the truth.	0
ClaimBuster	33090	Well, I certainly will, because I think that's a very fair and important question.	0
ClaimBuster	11349	The challenges that we face are unprecedented.	0
ClaimBuster	15673	But what I don't like is this left wing political agenda and therefore I have to help define that and if he's unwilling to do it, if he says ideology doesn't matter, I don't agree with him.	0
ClaimBuster	23319	I voted for the balanced budget in '93 and '97.	1
ClaimBuster	8854	But Detroit is being taxed for money that, let's say, will go to Chicago, while Chicago is being taxed to help with the problems in Philadelphia.	1
ClaimBuster	13998	And I'd be happy to discuss these other issues, but I can't believe he is accusing me of getting on both sides.	1
ClaimBuster	6704	He voted to increase taxes 98 times and to bust the budget 277 times.	1
ClaimBuster	23571	Let me give you a couple of examples, I guess, of the kind of person I wouldn't pick.	0
ClaimBuster	17625	With regard to Medicare, no, but it's time for us to say that Medicare is in pretty much the same condition that Social Security was, and something is going to have to be done in the next several years to make it fiscally sound.	0
ClaimBuster	20051	I don't think there is even a race between the two, it's about our vision for America.	0
ClaimBuster	20332	My plan also says it requires a new approach in Washington, D.C.	0
ClaimBuster	2204	And I don't think that's the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term.	0
ClaimBuster	7894	And when we compare the economic progress of this country in the Truman Administration with that of the Eisenhower Administration, we find that in every index there has been a tr- great deal more performance and more progress in this Administration than in that one.	1
ClaimBuster	27778	So it's pretty clear who doesn't want a trade war.	0
ClaimBuster	23927	But, I think it's very important to measure when and where things occurred.	0
ClaimBuster	22202	But it isn't going to get the job done if we don't change K through 12.	0
ClaimBuster	27169	We didn't ask for it.	0
ClaimBuster	8071	"And I believe the people, therefore, should be asked to make up their minds not simply on the basis of, ""Vote the way your grandfather did; vote the way your mother did."""	0
ClaimBuster	16201	Secondly, if you were so opposed to the grain embargo, why did you ask the godfather of the grain embargo to be one of your top foreign policy advisers?	0
ClaimBuster	23097	John Edwards is the author of the Patients' Bill of Rights.	1
ClaimBuster	5762	And I know from my experience in many campaigns that, if Senator Obama had asked -- responded to my urgent request to sit down, and do town hall meetings, and come before the American people, we could have done at least 10 of them by now.	0
ClaimBuster	9274	What was his participation there?	0
ClaimBuster	29266	We invested in a solar company, our country.	1
ClaimBuster	29593	As far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns.	0
ClaimBuster	3530	No, I -- look, we've got to fix the system.	0
ClaimBuster	6842	We're beginning to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	15421	I think the result of this debate indicates that that fact is true.	0
ClaimBuster	11438	And yet project strength in a way that promotes freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	642	I'm for the Stealth, I'm for the D-5, I'm for going ahead with the advance Cruise missile.	0
ClaimBuster	528	And yet, Mr. Bush says well, I don't think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees, when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured, that have to go to that hospital.	1
ClaimBuster	426	And that's one of the reasons why my state has cut crime by more than any other industrial state in America.	1
ClaimBuster	14086	But the real thing we got to have is a competitive economic strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	12382	I read a report, or a memo, from somebody in his 1988 campaign -- I forgot the fellow's name -- warning then Senator Gore to be careful about exaggerating claims.	1
ClaimBuster	12564	It is not enough for us simply to be the strongest nation militarily, the strongest economically, and also to have firm diplomacy.	0
ClaimBuster	29351	There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	26922	This is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries, and it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to America, long term, and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism.	1
ClaimBuster	18053	Now, once there, we could have continued those inspections.	0
ClaimBuster	22497	I got into this race because I did not want my child to grow up to be part of the first generation of Americans to do worse than her parents.	0
ClaimBuster	16256	(Laughter, applause) Isn't that the point?	0
ClaimBuster	17495	And we're the most religious people on Earth.	1
ClaimBuster	7991	Mr. Benson, testifying on the food stamp plan in 1957, said there were twenty-five million Americans who could not afford a elementary low-cost diet.	1
ClaimBuster	9060	For 200 years, we've lived in the future, believing that tomorrow would be better than today, and today would be better than yesterday.	1
ClaimBuster	27784	We have to say to our friend in China, look, you guys are playing aggressively.	0
ClaimBuster	34041	She shouldn't be allowed to run.	0
ClaimBuster	428	It's one of the reasons why we have a drug education and prevention program that is reaching out and helping youngsters all over our state, the kind of thing I want to do as president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	16846	uh - The estimate of the outside, if you eliminated all tax shelters, is 5 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	32008	He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	10508	Prosperity is not just going to trickle down.	0
ClaimBuster	19151	We go back and look at the healthcare plan that he wanted to impose on the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	33494	Hillary, you have no idea.	0
ClaimBuster	23592	I don't believe we need a good conservative judge, and I don't believe we need a good liberal judge.	0
ClaimBuster	2296	There've been 122 community and small banks have closed since Dodd- Frank.	1
ClaimBuster	245	So, research, speeding the drugs to market, testing, blood supply are very important elements of this.	0
ClaimBuster	10884	One last point I want to make on energy.	0
ClaimBuster	10869	We can do that, we as Americans, because we're the best innovators, we're the best producers, and 95 percent of the people who are our market live outside of the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	21204	I think we need to fully enforce the law.	0
ClaimBuster	16572	Well I think it's uh... very difficult for President Ford to uh - explain the difference between the pardon of President Nixon and - and uh - his attitude toward those who violated the draft laws.	0
ClaimBuster	27432	Their currency has dropped 80 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	34394	But Obamacare has to go.	0
ClaimBuster	1577	We never increased sales taxes or income tax or property tax.	1
ClaimBuster	7343	Well, first of all, it is just not true that I haven't met with the Black Congressional Caucus.	1
ClaimBuster	29646	And when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times.	1
ClaimBuster	22123	If it hadn't been for us, Saddam Hussein would be sitting on top of three-fifths of the oil supply of the world and he'd have nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	6776	It's between a woman, God and her doctor.	0
ClaimBuster	12597	At the American Conference - Inter-American Conference this summer, when we wanted them to join together in the denunciation of Castro and the Cuban Communists, we couldn't even get the Inter-American group to join together in denouncing Castro.	1
ClaimBuster	18511	That's what distinguishes us from the enemy.	0
ClaimBuster	740	But if there's one thing we also understand it is that you cannot make concessions to terrorists, ever, ever.	0
ClaimBuster	26280	It's pretty clear that was a quota case, and just because one teacher was white and one black and they had the same qualifications, you know they decided who would stay there.	0
ClaimBuster	26129	We have in the Dole-Kemp economic plan, unless unless your home's worth over 500,000 dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	12004	If you're going to sell a gun illegally, you need to be arrested.	0
ClaimBuster	19299	You also provide opportunity scholarships so low income parents will have the same choice that others have in sending their children to better schools.	0
ClaimBuster	22481	But I want you to think about just 2 or 3 things.	0
ClaimBuster	30276	We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries.	0
ClaimBuster	10257	If we have more people hired, if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get back all kinds of jobs into this country, then you're going to see rising incomes again.	0
ClaimBuster	25087	And we can see that in both Lebanon and in Central America.	0
ClaimBuster	10050	How could we have not known?	0
ClaimBuster	8247	I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals.	0
ClaimBuster	20526	Jim, the question you asked, if I heard you correctly, was would he support legislation to overturn it.	0
ClaimBuster	121	If he keeps this up, he's going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics.	0
ClaimBuster	12200	The top 1% will pay one-third of all the federal income taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	4196	Now, we also can't return to a Cold War posture with respect to Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	19374	It seems to me that you have a selective memory.	0
ClaimBuster	32009	And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.	1
ClaimBuster	29517	That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?	0
ClaimBuster	12361	And before we react, I think it's best to have the full accounting, full understanding of what's taking place.	0
ClaimBuster	375	Mr. Bush talked about values.	0
ClaimBuster	32872	Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters.	1
ClaimBuster	19510	We have done the following things: Number one, we've managed the aftermath of the Cold War, supporting a big drop in nuclear weapons in Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	9072	I believe that all of us are going to have to begin to work together to solve our problems.	0
ClaimBuster	25351	It's now 121/4, and I predict it'll be coming down a little more shortly.	1
ClaimBuster	24307	Number two, we've got to take care of this missile situation and try to get the nuclear war behind us and give this thing very high priority.	0
ClaimBuster	26205	President Clinton came to California in 1992.	1
ClaimBuster	34385	It's going to grow at a record rate of growth.	0
ClaimBuster	3047	The Ford administration will not let down, will not eliminate or forget our obligation to the people of Taiwan.	0
ClaimBuster	34040	I talk about the millions of people -- tell you one other thing.	0
ClaimBuster	32589	You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power.	1
ClaimBuster	13839	I sold them my remaining shares.	1
ClaimBuster	30126	It's a lot of money to protect other people.	0
ClaimBuster	1580	We still rank fifteenth among all the nations of the world in infant mortality.	1
ClaimBuster	10175	-- we haven't had the leadership in Washington to work on a bipartisan basis.	0
ClaimBuster	18187	And there's an enormous undone job to protect the loose nuclear materials in the world that are able to get to terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	10140	And there are a number of things.	0
ClaimBuster	32653	It was laughed at all over the world what happened.	0
ClaimBuster	7011	Now, Alan Greenspan, who I think has done a terrific job in monetary policy, supports the president's tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	28742	And I know they say it doesn't rank anywhere on the polls.	1
ClaimBuster	3825	We took our eye off the ball.	0
ClaimBuster	14476	Now, if that's true, just tell me now.	0
ClaimBuster	10596	If less money is coming in, you end up making cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	15862	"I didn't hear the word ""liberal"" or ""left"" one time."	0
ClaimBuster	12220	And they have not got it done.	1
ClaimBuster	515	I know what's happened over the course of the past eight years.	0
ClaimBuster	4402	I'm ready to go at it right now.	1
ClaimBuster	14759	Well, folks, we got one, and that one is a financial crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	5778	"And when you looked into the camera in a debate with Senator Clinton and said, ""I will sit down and negotiate with John McCain about public financing before I make a decision,"" you didn't tell the American people the truth because you didn't."	1
ClaimBuster	10696	But understand this: We also have to look at where some of our tax revenues are going.	0
ClaimBuster	18712	And I understand that in certain capitals around the world that that wasn't a popular move.	0
ClaimBuster	12672	I think we have to demonstrate to the people of the world that we're determined in this free country of ours to be first - not first if, and not first but, and not first when - but first.	0
ClaimBuster	8701	Recycle those proceeds, then, back into the pockets of the American workers by reducing their tax payments.	0
ClaimBuster	21696	But I believe we have to have some way of checking hand guns before they're sold, to check the criminal history, the mental health history, and the age of people who are buying them.	0
ClaimBuster	25072	The plane wasn't flying the way it was supposed to be; it was a waste of money.	1
ClaimBuster	34202	No, you are the one that's unfit.	0
ClaimBuster	7823	Second, as we consider this problem of unemployment, we have to realize where it is.	0
ClaimBuster	6332	A lot of people, including me, said, look, it's not doing what it should do.	1
ClaimBuster	20616	But I think we need to be very careful in the present situation before we invite the Russians to play the lead role in mediating.	0
ClaimBuster	1887	Jim, I -- you may want to move onto another topic, but I -- I would just say this to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	8965	But on his very optimistic figures about his tax cut producing a balanced budget by 1983, and the fact that he is using, he says, the figures of the Senate Budget Committee, that Senate Budget Committee Report does not accommodate all of the Reagan defense plans.	1
ClaimBuster	12854	But until we're strong here, until we're moving here, I believe a summit could not be successful.	0
ClaimBuster	21544	This is what a president has to do.	0
ClaimBuster	492	I think part of the answer to this haunting of these children that are out there and suffering lies in extension of Medicaid, to challenge the states, and maybe we're going to have to enforce more on the states in terms of Medicaid taking care of these.	0
ClaimBuster	18268	We didn't guard the borders.	0
ClaimBuster	32599	I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time.	1
ClaimBuster	7152	And if we did that, we'd have more consumption ability in America, which is what we need right now in order to kick our economy into gear.	0
ClaimBuster	11102	So what happened was we got distracted, we diverted resources, and ultimately bin Laden escaped, set up base camps in the mountains of Pakistan in the northwest provinces there.	1
ClaimBuster	12367	I feel very strongly the same place.	0
ClaimBuster	8725	There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	23843	But my economic program is the kind of change we want.	0
ClaimBuster	32600	And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	191	There isn't any such thing as something free out there.	0
ClaimBuster	15958	May I disagree with the premise of your question?	0
ClaimBuster	12238	And so they're looking for ways to satisfy their desire for a better life and still reduce pollution at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	11360	That's what America's all about.	0
ClaimBuster	6787	"I'm running to be a president who happens to be Catholic. """	1
ClaimBuster	10032	I said I'd end the war in Libya -- in -- in Iraq, and I did.	1
ClaimBuster	15755	And all of these things are going to have to be addressed.	0
ClaimBuster	30112	And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson.	1
ClaimBuster	15773	And now we have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age to ban weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	25030	Where I part with the President is that despite all of those differences we must, as past Presidents before this one have done, meet on the common ground of survival.	0
ClaimBuster	26687	By far, the largest number in American history -- not just the big ones you read about, but a lot of smaller ones.	1
ClaimBuster	21510	So I think you're right and I hope the rest of the night belongs to you.	0
ClaimBuster	3468	And we've got a lot of work to do.	0
ClaimBuster	1847	And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we're also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy.	0
ClaimBuster	3967	I can see how tough that terrain is.	0
ClaimBuster	12830	By adequate preparation I mean that at that level we must prepare an agenda, an agenda agreed upon with the approval of the heads of state involved.	0
ClaimBuster	17033	In the last few years government has gotten bigger and bigger; industry has gotten larger and larger; labor unions have gotten bigger and bigger; and our children have been the victims of mass education.	0
ClaimBuster	28038	Tipper and I were good friends with Mel and Randy, and I know that all of us here want to extend our sympathy and condolences to Jean and the family and to the Sifford family.	1
ClaimBuster	1688	"Ann yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, ""Ann, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs."	1
ClaimBuster	6802	I understand there's great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions.	0
ClaimBuster	26276	Well I'm glad you asked.	0
ClaimBuster	22302	We've got a pilot program.	1
ClaimBuster	16793	About a thousand raised their hands.	1
ClaimBuster	12570	We also believe that in the great field of ideals that we can lead America to the victory for freedom - victory in the newly developing countries, victory also in the captive countries - provided we have faith in ourselves and faith in our principles.	0
ClaimBuster	10953	You really identified one of the really major challenges that America faces.	0
ClaimBuster	21334	I want to get one with Eastern Europe; I want to get one with Chile.	0
ClaimBuster	26398	She finally gave it up.	1
ClaimBuster	32965	And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics.	0
ClaimBuster	13803	They will be my first priority, not my election year concern.	0
ClaimBuster	20031	I mean, you may be sending a signal.	0
ClaimBuster	18508	That's what she told me her husband understood.	1
ClaimBuster	128	Is this the time to unleash our one-liners?	0
ClaimBuster	392	And we ought to be prepared to provide those funds.	0
ClaimBuster	10548	Now, I've got to correct a little bit of Senator McCain's history, not surprisingly.	0
ClaimBuster	26780	Unfortunately, we didn't have more questions on that.	1
ClaimBuster	18154	What message does that send our troops?	0
ClaimBuster	32633	I've taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.	0
ClaimBuster	20455	We need to keep that in line.	0
ClaimBuster	20515	And Governor Bush has declared to the anti-choice groups that he will appoint justices in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who are known for being the most vigorous opponents of a woman's right to choose.	1
ClaimBuster	19423	I mean, you say we've done all these bad things, which isn't the case.	0
ClaimBuster	33321	It's just pouring and destroying their youth.	0
ClaimBuster	28350	That gets rid of the third biggest intrusion of the federal government in our economy.	1
ClaimBuster	30273	We have not been updating from the new standpoint.	1
ClaimBuster	24603	We've doubled it on research and on every other aspect of it.	1
ClaimBuster	17687	But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	17981	September the 11th changed how America must look at the world.	0
ClaimBuster	9219	He has a one-point plan.	1
ClaimBuster	8124	I'm not satisfied to have fifty percent of our steel-mill capacity unused.	1
ClaimBuster	10513	And that's why, for example, on tax policy, what I want to do is provide a middle class tax cut to 95 percent of working Americans, those who are working two jobs, people who are not spending enough time with their kids, because they are struggling to make ends meet.	0
ClaimBuster	23862	We have gone from first to thirteenth in wages in the world in the last twelve years, since Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan have been in.	1
ClaimBuster	27324	Well, let's come back and talk about the military, but all the way -- all the way through.	0
ClaimBuster	26443	It didn't look good the first two years when we had a Democratic president and Ã‚ Democratic Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	18624	When I was running -- when we had the debate in 2000, never dreamt I'd be doing that.	0
ClaimBuster	11741	I've devoted in the budget I've proposed, as I said last week, more than twice as much as the governor has proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	14438	Come on, that's not leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	17578	I'm not going to increase taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	20875	She's the 36th student in that classroom.	1
ClaimBuster	33281	This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make.	0
ClaimBuster	7739	Now that, of course, is just one factor, but it's a significant one.	0
ClaimBuster	19947	I sure stopped their budget.	1
ClaimBuster	8706	It would still have gone up as much as it has, and the $.50 would be added on top of that.	1
ClaimBuster	19125	You work harder and harder to make ends meet and put food on the table.	0
ClaimBuster	3886	They inform on the bad guys.	0
ClaimBuster	6906	And in exchange, if the states want to -- they're not forced to, they can choose to -- they cover individuals up to 300 percent of poverty.	1
ClaimBuster	26297	But he ought to apologize for wanting to take more and more.	0
ClaimBuster	21875	None of them ever get implemented because -- let me give you an example.	0
ClaimBuster	23087	We not only fixed Medicare and took it way out into the future, we did something that you don't know how to do: We balanced the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	27038	And so what I've done throughout my presidency and will continue to do is, number one, make sure that these countries are supporting our counterterrorism efforts.	1
ClaimBuster	14916	This has already passed the House, and it has an excellent prospect to pass the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	12121	I want a smaller and smarter government.	0
ClaimBuster	32558	I say it all the time.	0
ClaimBuster	12816	I've reached the conclusion that the Soviet Union is actually filibustering.	0
ClaimBuster	6109	In fact, what, Joe, if you want to do the right thing with your employees and you want to provide them health insurance, we'll give you a 50 percent credit so that you will actually be able to afford it.	0
ClaimBuster	32543	See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president.	0
ClaimBuster	2920	This is a responsibility of the president.	0
ClaimBuster	17672	I did avoid, I'm afraid, in my previous answer, also, the idea of uneven, yes.	0
ClaimBuster	9203	And I know he keeps saying, you want to take Detroit bankrupt.	1
ClaimBuster	30014	So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge.	0
ClaimBuster	12791	I think we should go back to Geneva, who's ever elected president, Mr. Nixon or myself, and try once again.	0
ClaimBuster	32165	So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.	0
ClaimBuster	15148	The Soviet Union sat at the table knowing that we had gone forward with unilateral concessions without any reciprocation from them whatsoever.	0
ClaimBuster	24377	He says don't do it, but the policies he's expounding of putting conditions on M.F.N.	1
ClaimBuster	22425	I believe that we need to export more so I'll keep working for export agreements where we can sell more abroad and I believe that we must strengthen the family.	0
ClaimBuster	23299	And I suspect, given his record, he's going to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	1249	Because of the uh - great -ly- greatly uh - advantaged uh - tho- per - persons who live in the suburbs, better education, better organization, more articulate, more aware of what the laws are, quite often this money has been channeled out of the downtown centers where it's needed.	0
ClaimBuster	8353	Uh - I can only say that my experience is there for the people to consider; Senator Kennedy's is there for the people to consider.	0
ClaimBuster	21223	Thank the University of Massachusetts and Mr. Vice President, thank you.	0
ClaimBuster	22475	Thank you, Carole, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen.	0
ClaimBuster	10052	I think these -- these actions taken by a president and a leader have symbolic significance and perhaps even material significance in that you'd hope that during that time we could call in the people who were actually eyewitnesses.	1
ClaimBuster	26300	When they had a 250 billion dollar tax scheme, that is half the size of this one.	1
ClaimBuster	8281	I prefer to take the overall percentage record of the last twenty years of the Democrats and the eight years of the Republicans to show an overall period of growth.	0
ClaimBuster	19682	Well, I believe that we did the appropriate thing under the circumstances.	0
ClaimBuster	19959	I've just finished reading a book, I think it's called -- what is it called, what is it, The Demise of the Democratic Party by Ronald Cardash (ph) or something talking about all the liberal influences in the administration.	1
ClaimBuster	23761	I believe America's best days are ahead of us.	0
ClaimBuster	5861	But as Senator Clinton said in her debates with you, we need to know the full extent of that relationship.	1
ClaimBuster	25617	My thanks to the League of Women Voters, to the panelists, the moderator, and to the people of Kansas City for their warm hospitality and greeting.	0
ClaimBuster	17714	I think it can only be that they're anticipating or hope -- expecting, not hoping, that maybe we don't have a control of inflation and it's going to go back up again.	0
ClaimBuster	18219	Of course we're doing everything we can to protect America.	0
ClaimBuster	26528	If we're saving money and managing resources better, that's a good thing.	0
ClaimBuster	14601	Jim, you permitted Mr. Bush to break the rules, he said, to defend the honor of the country.	1
ClaimBuster	10034	I said we'd transition out of Afghanistan, and start making sure that Afghans are responsible for their own security, that's what I'm doing.	1
ClaimBuster	11529	Well, when I got to be a part of the current administration, it was right after -- I was one of the few members of my political party to support former President Bush in the Persian Gulf War resolution, and at the end of that war, for whatever reason, it was not finished in a way that removed Saddam Hussein from power.	1
ClaimBuster	12028	Well, I'm not for registration.	0
ClaimBuster	13818	You've got to free up the private sector.	0
ClaimBuster	7180	Is that a new question or a 30-second question?	0
ClaimBuster	20831	Here are the key ingredients.	0
ClaimBuster	17808	And the American people don't have the slightest clue about what President Reagan will do about these deficits.	0
ClaimBuster	26578	If we don't get the economy to grow, if we don't cut taxes, and give people child credits, and cut the capital gains rate, and get this economy growing, we're going to limp into the next century.	0
ClaimBuster	9076	Do you think that our political institutions are working the way they should when literally only half of our citizens vote?	1
ClaimBuster	17303	What I object to -- [applause] -- what I object to -- what I object to is someone seeking to use his faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose it on others.	0
ClaimBuster	32414	Well, I think I should respond, because -- so ridiculous.	0
ClaimBuster	33594	And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.	0
ClaimBuster	1874	Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America.	1
ClaimBuster	33750	In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel.	1
ClaimBuster	23171	You're right, what does matter is a plan.	0
ClaimBuster	12747	Mr. Cronkite, I naturally am aware of it, because I, of course, pay attention to everything Senator Kennedy says, as well as Senator Fulbright.	0
ClaimBuster	3136	So it's the obligation of the president to do just that, and I intend to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	12670	I think the Communists have been moving with vigor - Laos, Africa, Cuba - all around the world today they're on the move.	0
ClaimBuster	6541	I have a plan to cover all Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	33353	I think it's an idea that would rip our country apart.	0
ClaimBuster	10180	So that's on the record.	0
ClaimBuster	29831	And it was terminated by current mayor.	1
ClaimBuster	20414	Now, another big difference is Governor Bush is proposing to open up some of our most precious environmental treasures, like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for the big oil companies to go in and start producing oil there.	1
ClaimBuster	2238	And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they're stuck.	0
ClaimBuster	14182	What should I have done?	0
ClaimBuster	23421	China and India are graduating more graduates in technology and science than we are.	1
ClaimBuster	19668	Well, maybe we bit off more than we could chew, but we're pursuing a step-by-step reform now.	0
ClaimBuster	4040	You don't muddle through stamping out the Taliban.	0
ClaimBuster	4034	Our troops have performed brilliantly.	0
ClaimBuster	14269	Yes, we tried, and, yes, we failed to bring him into the family of nations; he had the 4th largest army.	1
ClaimBuster	3835	Recently on a television program, he said it exceed our wildest expectations.	1
ClaimBuster	14207	We've created, and I'm not aiming at any one person here, I'm aiming at our government -- nobody takes responsibility for anything.	0
ClaimBuster	9304	We're actually drilling more on public lands than in the previous administration and my -- the previous president was an oil man.	1
ClaimBuster	21247	I want you to be on my team.	1
ClaimBuster	27268	I want to bring it back and get back good jobs and rising take-home pay.	0
ClaimBuster	19152	One seventh the total economy, 17 new taxes, price controls, 35 to 50 new bureaucracies that cost $1.5 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	18539	It's not a grand diversion.	0
ClaimBuster	23325	Yes, I mean, he's got a record.	0
ClaimBuster	15455	We do not have to go on sharing in scarcity with the country getting worse off, with unemployment growing.	0
ClaimBuster	14341	If you have time, go through Nexis and Lexis, pull all the old news articles, look at what Ambassador Glaspie said all through the fall and what-have-you, and then look at what she and Kelly and all the others in State said at the end when they were trying to clean it up.	0
ClaimBuster	9724	Now, we've seen 30 consecutive -- 31 consecutive months of job growth; 5.2 million new jobs created.	1
ClaimBuster	32637	It's how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot.	1
ClaimBuster	3070	Our allies feel that we've neglected them.	0
ClaimBuster	10571	We're going to have to coordinate with other countries to make sure that whatever actions we take work.	0
ClaimBuster	10069	The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people in the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened.	1
ClaimBuster	26558	Third thing I think we need is more forums like this, which is one of the reasons I have so strongly supported campaign finance reform.	0
ClaimBuster	13676	I think everybody's paying too much taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	7131	Well, I'm glad you raised that question.	0
ClaimBuster	29233	Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	20613	They currently favor going forward with a runoff election.	1
ClaimBuster	11191	We are going to have to make the Iraqi government start taking more responsibility, withdraw our troops in a responsible way over time, because we're going to have to put some additional troops in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	9048	Two hundred years ago, Tom Paine, when the 13 tiny colonies were trying to become a nation, said, we have it in our power to begin the world over again.	1
ClaimBuster	32115	Because you have nothing to say.	0
ClaimBuster	26851	Whether we're going to give our families more protection for their kids against drugs and tobacco and gangs and guns.	0
ClaimBuster	9864	My dad was born in Mexico of American parents; Ann's dad was born in Wales and is a first-generation American.	1
ClaimBuster	2821	And more recently, he talks about cutting the defense budget by five to seven billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	30223	The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship.	1
ClaimBuster	23595	He was a justice on the Supreme Court of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	24814	And the greatest repayment I can ever give is to recreate the American dream for your children and grandchildren.	0
ClaimBuster	28706	It's not just movies; television, video games, music, the Internet.	0
ClaimBuster	25129	And I have no apologies for our going on a peace mission.	0
ClaimBuster	5582	I would prefer that none of us had to pay taxes, including myself.	0
ClaimBuster	32540	A lot of my -- excuse me, Anderson -- a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed.	1
ClaimBuster	34110	And I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track.	0
ClaimBuster	9865	We welcome legal immigrants into this country.	0
ClaimBuster	11357	I know what it's like to have to fight to keep one's hope going through difficult times.	0
ClaimBuster	28473	And while I was there I worked on a bipartisan basis, as I did in the House, I worked with former President Reagan on the modernization of our strategic weaponry.	1
ClaimBuster	13417	The fa- the farmer who grows wheat gets about two and a half cents out of a twenty-five-cent loaf of bread.	1
ClaimBuster	23199	And plus, we cut taxes for everybody.	1
ClaimBuster	30211	With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb.	1
ClaimBuster	18117	He believes in the freedom of the Iraqi people.	1
ClaimBuster	6112	He says he's going to give you all a $5,000 tax credit.	1
ClaimBuster	20245	Our country has cut the welfare rolls in half.	1
ClaimBuster	28896	No, I'm not proud of that.	0
ClaimBuster	16921	We've had uh - Republican presidents before who've tried to run against a Democratic - uh Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	32769	I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul.	0
ClaimBuster	15724	I think you know because you've covered these issues, that there's no way that we can build all of the weapons the Vice President says he wants to build within the defense budget.	1
ClaimBuster	26081	"I, I still remember a woman that I met ten years ago who said she wanted to get off welfare so her kids could tell, give an answer when they say, ""What does your mother do for a job?"""	1
ClaimBuster	10058	Consider the distance between ourselves and -- and Israel, the president said that -- that he was going to put daylight between us and Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	2823	Now let me just tell you a little story.	0
ClaimBuster	24301	We really need to nail down the big intercontinental ballistic missiles, the ones that can hit us from Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	32201	And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody's ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you're never going to be able to use it.	1
ClaimBuster	9974	You also have investments outside the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	23621	Now, I believe that you can take that position and not be pro- abortion, but you have to afford people their constitutional rights.	0
ClaimBuster	1344	What we have to do, and this is the crux of the matter, is to make it very, very uh - difficult for a person who uses a gun in the commission of a crime to stay out of jail.	0
ClaimBuster	6769	I completely respect their views.	0
ClaimBuster	15043	To involve them in the administration of government and the feeling that they belong to the societal structure that makes decisions in the judiciary and in the executive branch is a very important commitment which I am trying to realize and will continue to do so in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	19193	So some may be better off.	0
ClaimBuster	33317	They feel we have to have strong borders.	0
ClaimBuster	21982	Most people are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	2024	You raise taxes and you kill jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	22769	I recognize that taking Saddam Hussein out was unpopular.	0
ClaimBuster	15210	That's one major war explosion in a warhead.	0
ClaimBuster	24822	I'd like to thank the hundreds of executives who came to Chicago, a third of them Republicans, who said they wanted to change.	1
ClaimBuster	14334	Well, where are the papers?	0
ClaimBuster	3075	The highest unemployment of any developed nation of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	23867	We're living in a new world after the Cold War, and what works in this new world is not trickle down, not government for the benefit of the privileged few, not tax and spend, but a commitment to invest in American jobs and American education, controlling American health care costs, and bringing the American people together.	0
ClaimBuster	29562	Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.	0
ClaimBuster	24788	I love the people here.	0
ClaimBuster	16047	And I don't have a list, but I think the appointments that the President has made to the Bench have been outstanding, outstanding appointments.	0
ClaimBuster	18713	But it's the right move not to join a foreign court that could -- where our people could be prosecuted.	0
ClaimBuster	9693	Let me come back and -- and answer your question.	0
ClaimBuster	15265	And to this day, not one of its decisions or rulings has ever been challenged.	1
ClaimBuster	21887	I think we ought to do plastic surgery on a lot of these guys so that they're all ears, too, and listen to you.	0
ClaimBuster	10324	Government does not create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	2533	In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions.	0
ClaimBuster	5538	You were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going to increase his taxes, which was going to cause him not to be able to employ people, which Joe was trying to realize the American dream.	1
ClaimBuster	8177	But when you're in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	15252	Governor Reagan says that this is not a good achievement, and he blames restraints on coal production on regulations - regulations that affect the life and the health and safety of miners, and also regulations that protect the purity of our air and the quality our water and our land.	1
ClaimBuster	2321	We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s.	1
ClaimBuster	1320	I personally don't believe that the federal government oughta finance abortions, but I - I draw the line and don't support a constitutional amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	530	Were ready to go to work at the state and local level, all of us.	0
ClaimBuster	23038	One is to speed up generic drugs to the marketplace, quicker.	0
ClaimBuster	10226	We have made it less attractive for enterprises to stay here than to go offshore from time to time.	0
ClaimBuster	27230	Doing everything we can to control our own energy.	0
ClaimBuster	19756	Prime Minister Rabin gave his life because someone in his own country literally hated him for trying to bring peace.	0
ClaimBuster	22888	An all-volunteer army is best suited to fight the new wars of the 21st century, which is to be specialized and to find these people as they hide around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	2439	And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	26602	Because we've got a lot of people advocating we don't want to put our money into Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	14314	And we got some very good Republican women running.	1
ClaimBuster	25345	And that's why this enormous national debt, engineered by this administration, is harming these countries in fueling this immigration.	1
ClaimBuster	30349	And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability.	0
ClaimBuster	12213	We're doing it faster than any other state our size, comparable state.	1
ClaimBuster	1335	And in those two cases, I would favor them.	0
ClaimBuster	7859	I've been critical of this Administration and I've been critical of the President.	0
ClaimBuster	21820	The key is to control the cost and maintain the quality.	0
ClaimBuster	28492	And that means keeping our military strong.	0
ClaimBuster	12758	Finally, let me say this: as far as prestige is concerned, the first place it would show up would be in the United Nations.	0
ClaimBuster	3959	We've got to get the support of the people of -- of Pakistan.	0
ClaimBuster	27325	First of all, I'm going through from the very beginning -- we're going to cut about 5 percent of the discretionary budget, excluding military.	0
ClaimBuster	26079	And I hope we get a chance to talk about this more.	0
ClaimBuster	81	And in my state I'm proud to say we've organized a drug education and prevention program which the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration says is a model for the country.	1
ClaimBuster	28943	(LAUGHTER) I am a person who keeps promises.	0
ClaimBuster	24059	I don't think we need 150,000 troops.	0
ClaimBuster	6084	Take it and get anywhere in America the health care that you wish.	0
ClaimBuster	1671	I think it's important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America, that we change our tax code to make sure that we're helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States, that we take some of the money that we're saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments.	0
ClaimBuster	9752	There's no doubt about it.	0
ClaimBuster	28129	Now look, if you want someone who will spend a lot of words describing a whole convoluted process and then end up supporting legislation that is supported by the big drug companies, this is your man.	1
ClaimBuster	1698	Crack down on China, if and when they cheat.	0
ClaimBuster	26588	But these are important questions.	0
ClaimBuster	27821	I said they need -- these companies need to go through a managed bankruptcy.	0
ClaimBuster	21271	I want to tell her, I'll fight for a prescription drug benefit for all seniors and fight for the people of this country for a prosperity that benefits all.	0
ClaimBuster	17509	Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment?	0
ClaimBuster	15556	I don't want to kill it off by a tax increase.	0
ClaimBuster	184	I am proud to have been part of an administration that past the first catastrophic health bill.	1
ClaimBuster	23194	We've got to pay our troops more.	0
ClaimBuster	26414	We're going to get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	13613	The rich are paying a bigger percent of the total tax burden.	1
ClaimBuster	25220	This is the fourth time this has happened -- an identical attack, in the same region, despite warnings -- even public warnings -- from the terrorists.	1
ClaimBuster	28920	I support the death penalty.	1
ClaimBuster	12219	They've had eight years to get something done on Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	22260	I did a study on it; they're cost- ineffective.	1
ClaimBuster	12005	If you commit a crime with a gun, there needs to be absolute certainty in the law.	0
ClaimBuster	22439	Getting things done in three months that my competitors took 18 months to do.	1
ClaimBuster	22161	Got to keep going until all those nuclear weapons in Russia are gone and the other republics.	0
ClaimBuster	20126	So let's just, let's give credit where credit is due.	0
ClaimBuster	17892	Will our children be better off?	0
ClaimBuster	7935	I'm talking about a national mood.	0
ClaimBuster	6880	Once again, the president is misleading America.	0
ClaimBuster	14983	And there would simply be a delay, and on the other hand, many of the people who would then be given jobs are presently wards of the Government and it wouldn't hurt to give them a tax incentive, because they... that wouldn't be costing Government anything either.	0
ClaimBuster	11214	First of all, as I say, I don't think that -- we're not going to have another Cold War with Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	17039	Your mothers and fathers did the same thing for you and others.	0
ClaimBuster	1150	And I know that everybody uh - makes mistakes.	0
ClaimBuster	1146	Now he did use uh - ill-advised words, but I think in the fact that he apologized, that he was reprimanded, uh - does permit him to stay on and continue that kind of leadership that's we so badly need as we enter into uh - negotiations uh - under the SALT II agreement, or if we have operations that might be developing uh in the Middle East or southern Africa, in the Pacific, uh - we need a man with that experience, that knowledge, that know-how, and I think, in light of the fact that he has uh - apologized, uh - would not have justified my asking for his resignation.	1
ClaimBuster	17126	In other words, it doesn't converge as the President suggests.	0
ClaimBuster	8996	Our Government, in its most sacred documents - the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and all - speak of man being created, of a Creator.	0
ClaimBuster	6782	I will defend the right of Roe v. Wade.	0
ClaimBuster	3235	That's one of the problems with this administration's so-called shuttle diplomacy.	0
ClaimBuster	15390	I believe that if in all these years that we have spent trying to get the amendment, that we had spent as much time correcting these laws, as we did in California - and we were the first to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	30093	And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.	1
ClaimBuster	2481	I used to consult to businesses -- excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers.	1
ClaimBuster	2458	But the problem is, he hasn't described what exactly we'd replace it with, other than saying we're going to leave it to the states.	1
ClaimBuster	13724	So I think probably we're making a mistake night after night after night to cast the nation's future on a unit that small.	0
ClaimBuster	18368	That's not how you bring people together.	0
ClaimBuster	5524	That's why we included in the financial package a proposal to get homeowners in a position where they can renegotiate their mortgages.	1
ClaimBuster	22905	But let me tell you where the president's policies have put us.	0
ClaimBuster	28558	To me that's how you make society the safest it can be.	0
ClaimBuster	27170	But it's an honor that we have it.	0
ClaimBuster	15836	But we used that as a role model, the way he took understandable pride in his heritage, what his family means to him.	0
ClaimBuster	20904	First of all, I do have mandatory testing.	0
ClaimBuster	22153	Because the question you ask is important.	0
ClaimBuster	24954	How can something this serious occur in an administration and have a President of the United States in a situation like this say he didn't know?	0
ClaimBuster	33216	Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.	1
ClaimBuster	7595	There isn't any question but that we will defend our rights there.	0
ClaimBuster	8070	The people have to make up their minds.	0
ClaimBuster	3336	Let me restate uh - our policy.	0
ClaimBuster	8890	It just takes - from the people.	0
ClaimBuster	9246	But what I've also said is we can't just produce traditional source of energy.	1
ClaimBuster	16055	And I think the Vice President supported the Bork nomination.	0
ClaimBuster	21796	So we need to do the reforms and the term limits.	0
ClaimBuster	32879	Because we talked about what we wanted to do.	0
ClaimBuster	11182	And we have fundamental disagreements about the use of military power and how you do it, and you just saw it in response to previous questions.	0
ClaimBuster	21972	I have seen what's happened in this last 4 years when -- in my state, when people lose their jobs there's a good chance I'll know them by their names.	0
ClaimBuster	32743	How -- why would these people stay there?	0
ClaimBuster	12104	For those what I think we need to do is to develop an investment-type vehicle that would be an incentive for them to invest, like medical savings accounts with rollover capacity.	0
ClaimBuster	3878	We don't want our kids coming back here.	0
ClaimBuster	262	Now, that's a certain passion that in my view it's misguided passion.	0
ClaimBuster	25259	I know it'll come as a surprise to Mr. Mondale, but I am in charge.	0
ClaimBuster	22001	So at least we have time to work with it.	0
ClaimBuster	7531	Over the next four years, we'll continue to insist on excellence in every classroom in America so that our children have a chance to realize the great promise of America.	0
ClaimBuster	2012	You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year.	1
ClaimBuster	26555	Secondly, I think we need to look at making the elections more accessible.	0
ClaimBuster	14146	They have not been forthcoming.	0
ClaimBuster	7090	Let me just answer one part of the last question quickly, and then I'll come to immigration.	0
ClaimBuster	23042	Wanda Blackmore I met here from Missouri, the first time she bought drugs with her drug discount card, she paid $1.14, I think it was, for about $10 worth of drugs.	1
ClaimBuster	10314	That's why we have to invest in advanced manufacturing.	0
ClaimBuster	21148	"I think the thing that discouraged me about the vice president was uttering those famous words, ""No controlling legal authority."""	0
ClaimBuster	6994	I will not privatize it.	0
ClaimBuster	8016	I believe that when you get into a w- if you're going to get into war for the defense of Formosa, it ought to be on a clearly defined line.	0
ClaimBuster	23342	I proposed to the United States Congress a Clear Skies Initiative to reduce sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury by 70 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	2484	We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that's happening.	0
ClaimBuster	19409	The most heavily directed, decorated solder in uniform when he retired.	1
ClaimBuster	34451	Our inner cities are a disaster.	0

ClaimBuster	33668	When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt.	1
ClaimBuster	13307	We can't have any test of race.	0
ClaimBuster	7946	And all I say is, I don't know what the sixties will bring - except I think they will bring hard times in the uh - international sphere; I hope we can move ahead here at home in the United States; I'm confident we can do a far better job of mobilizing our economy and resources in the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	24353	They rewarded him by opening negotiations with Iran to transfer nuclear technology.	0
ClaimBuster	13348	The fact-finding committee's powers are limited.	0
ClaimBuster	34131	He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes.	1
ClaimBuster	14923	Mr. Ellis, I think this idea that has been spawned here in our country that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore it's uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is entirely spurious and it's dangerous to say this to the people.	0
ClaimBuster	21040	In the reinventing government program you just look at the numbers.	0
ClaimBuster	33650	We are going to cut taxes massively.	0
ClaimBuster	12355	Oh, you mean the rules.	0
ClaimBuster	23834	I want to bring that change to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	18113	We've got a plan to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	22953	Thank you very much, Ann.	0
ClaimBuster	16940	The Congress can modify the supply of money by modifying the income uh tax laws.	1
ClaimBuster	10154	The -- the greatest failure we've had with regards to -- to gun violence in some respects is what -- what is known as Fast and Furious.	1
ClaimBuster	20960	Was Ã¢â‚¬â€œ what was the question?	0
ClaimBuster	13379	This doesn't mean that the people aren't going to be paying the bill.	0
ClaimBuster	19460	And, there are eight other categories that should not have guns.	0
ClaimBuster	23409	I'm going to shut that loophole, and I'm going to give the tax benefit to the companies that stay here in America to help make them more competitive.	0
ClaimBuster	29216	What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	2721	And everything that I've tried to do, and everything that I'm now proposing for the next four years in terms of improving our education system or developing American energy or making sure that we're closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the United States, or closing our deficit in a responsible, balanced way that allows us to invest in our future.	0
ClaimBuster	13496	In other words, if we're going to continue to maintain our position in the sixties, we have to maintain a sound monetary and fiscal policy.	0
ClaimBuster	17878	I think we've given the American people back their spirit.	0
ClaimBuster	8482	When the president exercises his veto power, he has to have the people upo- behind him, not just a third of the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	24003	That's going to take money for infrastructure and investment to do that.	0

ClaimBuster	17655	Half -- one out of two of the full-time college students in the United States are receiving some form of Federal aid.	1
ClaimBuster	22822	The president did not do what was necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	15843	And I would say, I don't know whether that's kind or not, it's just an objective statement.	0
ClaimBuster	12130	And Texas ranks 49th out of the 50 states in health care -- in children with health care.	1
ClaimBuster	15644	I don't think it's a question of whether people like you or not to make you an effective leader.	0
ClaimBuster	23630	I'm trying to decipher that.	0
ClaimBuster	2155	So if you're 60 or around 60 or older, you don't need to listen any further.	0
ClaimBuster	31889	I apologize to my family.	0
ClaimBuster	29250	Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.	1
ClaimBuster	26391	We're going to do that with regulatory reform.	0
ClaimBuster	8503	One was a bill for a dollar twenty-five cents an hour for anyone who works in a store or company that has a million dollars a year business.	1
ClaimBuster	7605	Thirdly, Arthur Gardner, a Republican Ambassador, Earl Smith, a Republican Ambassador, in succession - both have indicated in the past six weeks that they reported to Washington that Castro was a Marxist, that Raul Castro was a Communist, and that they got no effective results.	1
ClaimBuster	33665	He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt.	1
ClaimBuster	18651	With the American military forces nearby and in the field, we didn't use the best trained troops in the world to go kill the world's number one criminal and terrorist.	1
ClaimBuster	14758	The president mentioned that you need the right person in a crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	33894	So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies, and she caused the violence.	1
ClaimBuster	6133	This will give them availability.	0
ClaimBuster	20923	The governor, if it's a failing school, would leave the children in that failing school for three years and then give a little bit of money to the parents, a down payment on a down payment for private school tuition, and pretend that that would be enough for them to go out and go to a private school.	1
ClaimBuster	29122	I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.	0
ClaimBuster	24931	And he drew up this manual.	1
ClaimBuster	5711	He voted for the last two budgets that had that $24 billion more in spending than the budget that the Bush administration proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	32629	But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	1684	This is obviously a very tender topic.	0
ClaimBuster	9833	He's great as a -- as a -- as a speaker and describing his plans and his vision.	0
ClaimBuster	5827	We do and I hope...	0
ClaimBuster	11677	I would certainly also be judicious in evaluating any potential use of American troops overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	17387	That barely held even with -- if it did that much -- with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977.	1
ClaimBuster	1769	And, by the way, I like coal.	0
ClaimBuster	14661	We're doing better than a lot of the countries in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	23133	The reason I bring that up is because he's proposed $2.2 trillion in new spending, and he says he going to tax the rich to close the tax gap.	1
ClaimBuster	29189	Our country's in deep trouble.	0
ClaimBuster	33231	And I am -- I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA.	0
ClaimBuster	29276	We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	24826	Mr. Bush has said some very compelling things tonight that don't quite square with the record.	0
ClaimBuster	11601	I did support it at the time.	1
ClaimBuster	18099	That's why it's essential that we make sure that we keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of people like Al Qaida, which we are.	0
ClaimBuster	27658	So those are the kinds of things that we can now do because we're making that transition in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	6667	And we're going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here.	0
ClaimBuster	1957	But I'm not going to -- I'm not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for.	0
ClaimBuster	22270	(Laughter) Now, that's your tax money being wasted.	0
ClaimBuster	29338	And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.	1
ClaimBuster	26245	It ought to be not based on gender or ethnicity or color.	0
ClaimBuster	11108	So part of the reason I think it's so important for us to end the war in Iraq is to be able to get more troops into Afghanistan, put more pressure on the Afghan government to do what it needs to do, eliminate some of the drug trafficking that's funding terrorism.	1
ClaimBuster	10123	But there were a lot of families who didn't have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters or husbands didn't survive.	0
ClaimBuster	16445	Another thing is to deal with our - uh needs in the central cities, where the unemployment rate is extremely high: sometimes among minority groups, or those who don't speak English, or who're black, or young people, or - 40 percent of the employment.	1
ClaimBuster	28981	I'm sure your 6th grade kids are listening and saying, these guys will say anything to get elected.	0
ClaimBuster	7418	I've never seen members of a party locked out of meetings the way they're locked out today.	0
ClaimBuster	27986	I was in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat.	1
ClaimBuster	23707	That's why Senator Lugar says: incompetent in the delivery of services.	1
ClaimBuster	27269	Well, let's talk about what we need to compete.	0
ClaimBuster	6152	And don't take my word for it.	0
ClaimBuster	5589	Our tax rate for business in America is 35 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	15486	And it's one of the reasons why we have had the biggest drop in crime of any industrial state in America; why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in America.	1
ClaimBuster	27222	America remains the one indispensable nation.	0
ClaimBuster	10323	Government does not create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	2422	You've raised them by $1 trillion under Obamacare.	1
ClaimBuster	20059	And I think I have my strengths and I think the best thing going for Bob Dole is that Bob Dole keeps his word.	0
ClaimBuster	25534	I have described what has happened in Iran, and we weren't here then either.	0
ClaimBuster	25480	I will not agree to any arms control agreement, including a freeze, that's not verifiable.	0
ClaimBuster	15660	And what I've had to do is define, not just my position, but to define his and I hope I've done it fairly.	0
ClaimBuster	11453	But the fact that it is so strong enables us to project the power for good that America can represent.	0
ClaimBuster	29771	But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe.	0
ClaimBuster	25908	We had 7 billion this year and 10 billion more than the president.	1
ClaimBuster	6379	We have to make quality education there for all of our citizens, not just the privileged few.	0
ClaimBuster	17763	And give us a plan.	0
ClaimBuster	15296	We cannot frighten, as we have with the threats and the campaign rhetoric that has gone on in this campaign, our senior citizens - leave them thinking that in some way, they're endangered and they would have no place to turn.	0
ClaimBuster	28886	The harder you work, the more you can keep.	0
ClaimBuster	27961	And we've been through tough times but we always bounce back because of our character, because we pull together and if I have the privilege of being your president for another four years, I promise you I will always listen to your voices.	0
ClaimBuster	20256	I think it's the hard-working people of America's money and I want to share some of that money with you so you have more money to build and save and dream for your families.	0
ClaimBuster	23691	We knew he tortured his own people.	1
ClaimBuster	8870	It seems to totally belie the claim that I heard President Carter make a few days ago, that he was the first President that had come forth with a real urban strategy to meet the problems of urban America.	1
ClaimBuster	10515	But underlying that is loss of jobs and loss of income.	0
ClaimBuster	17277	And I believe I have sung at more weddings and more funerals than anybody ever to seek the Presidency.	1
ClaimBuster	9082	What I wish tonight so desperately is that we had had more time to talk about some of the other issues that are so fundamentally important.	0
ClaimBuster	34340	And people, Chris, will again go back to work and they'll make a lot of money.	0
ClaimBuster	2876	Obviously, this is another indication of trying to use the defense budget for political purposes, which he's trying to do tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	17352	And they want an American foreign policy that leads toward a safer world.	0
ClaimBuster	1846	But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot.	1
ClaimBuster	2591	The proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty.	1
ClaimBuster	28200	So health care needs to be affordable and available.	0
ClaimBuster	18846	Well, first of all, I appreciate enormously the personal comments the president just made.	0
ClaimBuster	20385	Let me make sure the seniors hear me loud and clear.	0
ClaimBuster	22027	Then, if the plans are huge and complex like health care, I would urge you to implement pilot programs.	0
ClaimBuster	9080	It's been a time, therefore, of illusion and false hopes, and the longer it continues, the more dangerous it becomes.	0
ClaimBuster	764	And I've said mistakes were made.	0
ClaimBuster	18577	"""Oops, we haven't done the job."	0
ClaimBuster	27807	And we're organizing trade relations with countries other than China so that China starts feeling more pressure about meeting basic international standards.	1
ClaimBuster	14154	It wasn't failing to serve.	0
ClaimBuster	32873	It's with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	14504	I don't have an indoor gymnasium and an indoor tennis and an indoor every other thing they can think of; I don't have a place where I can go make free TV to send to my constituents to try to brainwash them to elect me the next time.	1
ClaimBuster	20563	I want the viewers out there to listen to what I have to say about it.	0
ClaimBuster	16923	That, I think, is a good balance.	0
ClaimBuster	10028	You don't turn national security into a political issue.	0
ClaimBuster	32718	I think that it basically has fallen.	0
ClaimBuster	4217	It had everything to do with energy.	0
ClaimBuster	17174	The President says it will disappear overnight because of some reason.	1
ClaimBuster	7136	We're not allowed to vote on it.	1
ClaimBuster	21114	The trillion comes from the surplus.	1
ClaimBuster	16748	I recommended to the Congress that we should increase production in this country from six hundred million tons a year to twel- a- a billion two hundred million tons by 1985.	1
ClaimBuster	16068	Is he talking about a former Governor of the State of California, who is a former prosecutor, a Republican named Earl Warren, because I think Chief Justice Earl Warren was an outstanding Chief Justice and I think most Americans do too.	1
ClaimBuster	12761	There we got more votes for condemning Hungary and looking into that situation than we got the last year.	1
ClaimBuster	18388	We've got a plan in place.	1
ClaimBuster	32387	That I can tell you.	0
ClaimBuster	9717	And President Bush has a very different path for a very different time.	0
ClaimBuster	28989	But it's gonna require people to bring both Republicans and Democrats together to get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	27302	How did we do that?	0
ClaimBuster	9495	I think what grows the economy is when we make sure small businesses are getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who fought for our country.	0
ClaimBuster	244	We cannot have a lack of confidence in the blood supply when it comes to operations and surgery and things of this nature.	0
ClaimBuster	29688	Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system.	1
ClaimBuster	21378	Here's some thing that'll help.	0
ClaimBuster	33304	In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of -- I mean, these are unbelievable people that I've gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally.	1
ClaimBuster	2984	That's not the way to run our foreign policy, including international trade.	0
ClaimBuster	2703	"But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, ""I'll sit down,"" but you have to have a plan."	0
ClaimBuster	24143	And the way to do better is not to tax and spend but to retrain, get that control of the mandatory spending programs.	0
ClaimBuster	16281	And we've got to work with them if we are going to create an environment for human rights and democracy for the people of this hemisphere, and go to work on our single most important problem, and that is the avalanche of drugs that is poring into our country and virtually destroying those countries.	0
ClaimBuster	921	I will not go back to the way the Democrats did it and used food as a political weapon and throw a grain embargo on the farmers in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	17907	I believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment.	0
ClaimBuster	18499	Her husband PJ got killed.	1
ClaimBuster	13119	And I say that those of us who stand against surrender of territory - this or any others - in the face of blackmail, in the s- face of force by the Communists are standing for the course that will lead to peace.	0
ClaimBuster	18448	And I believe that a fresh start, new credibility, a president who can understand what we have to do to reach out to the Muslim world to make it clear that this is not, you know -- Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq in order to go out to people and say that America has declared war on Islam.	0
ClaimBuster	23851	Values, judgment, and the record that I have amassed in my state also should count for something.	0
ClaimBuster	10659	I think it's very important that we reform our entitlement programs.	0
ClaimBuster	24117	But I do not want to go the tax-and-spend route.	0
ClaimBuster	27908	That will not help us compete with China.	0
ClaimBuster	8805	In 1977, we took that away from the military.	1
ClaimBuster	14161	I appreciate their idealism, their sacrifices.	0
ClaimBuster	3696	And I also think that we're going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities.	0
ClaimBuster	4400	Reform, prosperity, and peace, these are major challenges to the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	1071	Now, like uh - any hardworking uh - person seeking public office uh - in the campaign, inevitably sometimes you will use uh - rather graphic language and I'm guilty of that just like I think most others in the political arena.	0
ClaimBuster	7467	I think you'll find somebody who might interest you.	0
ClaimBuster	10630	And we need to reform.	0
ClaimBuster	27354	We spend more on our military than the next 10 countries combined; China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, you name it.	1
ClaimBuster	1368	And uh - the only purpose that I would see in registering uh - handguns and not long guns of any kind would be to prohibit the uh - ownership of those guns by those who've used them in the commission of a crime, or who uh - have been proven to be mentally incompetent to own a gun.	1
ClaimBuster	17600	I don't foresee those things happening, so I say with great confidence I'm not going to go for a tax.	0
ClaimBuster	20148	I'd like to leave you with the thought that the things I do as president are basically driven by the people whose lives I have seen affected by what does or doesn't happen in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	2570	Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states.	1
ClaimBuster	25964	Oscar, the question of what the federal government should do to limit the access of tobacco to young people is one of the biggest differences between Senator Dole and me.	1
ClaimBuster	27357	And that's the budget that we've put forward.	0
ClaimBuster	334	I believe that that would help in terms of shelter.	0
ClaimBuster	2408	And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold.	0
ClaimBuster	15238	Most of this is due to regulations which either interfere with the mining of it or prevent the burning of it:.	1
ClaimBuster	32903	It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.	1
ClaimBuster	29405	And look at her website.	0
ClaimBuster	13016	All of them voted for freedom - a free type of government.	1
ClaimBuster	30070	But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that.	0
ClaimBuster	12480	And finally, I do believe in tax relief.	0
ClaimBuster	28845	He said if affirmative action means quotas, he's against it.	1
ClaimBuster	29928	When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community.	0
ClaimBuster	8018	I believe that we should defend Formosa.	0
ClaimBuster	22011	But the more immediate answer is to do what this lady was suggesting we do, and that is to get this deficit down and get on without adding to the woes, and then restructure.	0
ClaimBuster	3652	John, you want to give oil companies another $4 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	16544	And I believe that by eliminating ten million taxpayers in the last uh eight years, and by putting a heavier tax burden on those in the higher tax brackets, plus the other actions that've been taken uh - we can give taxpayers adequate tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	12171	There's only been one governor ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms, and that was me.	1
ClaimBuster	7433	The No Child Left Behind Act, incredibly enough, was good work between me and my administration and people like Senator Ted Kennedy.	0
ClaimBuster	18294	And I'm going to lead those troops to victory.	0
ClaimBuster	32048	We have literally Trump -- you can fact check him in real time.	0
ClaimBuster	13807	You don't have to go back to Herbert Hoover.	0
ClaimBuster	18330	Of course, the U.N. was invited in.	1
ClaimBuster	29133	And we have a very good fight.	0
ClaimBuster	32654	Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	27456	I would have put them in place earlier.	0
ClaimBuster	32768	I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	21729	So we're making progress but until we get that one done, we're not going to solve the neighborhood crime problem.	0
ClaimBuster	24978	I have said on a number of occasions exactly what I believe about the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	15099	First of all, I would be fearful that I might say something that was presently under way or in negotiations, and thus expose it and endanger the hostages, and sometimes, I think some of my ideas might require quiet diplomacy where you don't say in advance, or say to anyone, what it is you're thinking of doing.	0
ClaimBuster	29857	I'd just like to respond.	0
ClaimBuster	17692	We are now $120 billion of imports, 3 million jobs lost, and farmers are having their worst year.	1
ClaimBuster	7931	Well I don't think that in the winter of sixty-one under present economic conditions, it uh - a - uh - tax uh - increase would be desirable.	0
ClaimBuster	13169	And I just want to make one thing very clear.	0
ClaimBuster	11225	We have to make the Russians understand that there are penalties for these this kind of behavior, this kind of naked aggression into Georgia, a tiny country and a tiny democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	9775	"When he said, ""We're going to repeal Obamacare."	0
ClaimBuster	9278	Look, I want to make sure we use our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables.	0
ClaimBuster	25694	I got lots of relatives and they're good, average, middle-class, hardworking Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	27476	Well, first of all those are reports in the newspaper.	0
ClaimBuster	3902	The question is, was this wise?	0
ClaimBuster	22804	He rushed to war without a plan to win the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	16609	We have twenty different agencies in the federal government responsible for the production, the regulation, the uh - information about energy, the conservation of energy, spread all over government.	1
ClaimBuster	16914	President Eisenhower worked with a Democratic Congress very well.	1
ClaimBuster	10750	It means -- and I have to, again, repeat this.	0
ClaimBuster	6670	He discovered Boeing during the course of this campaign after I'd been talking about it for months.	1
ClaimBuster	16906	He has, in effect, said that he would agree with all of - he would disapprove of the vetoes that I have made, and would have added significantly to expenditures and the deficit in the federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	26640	Democrats or Republicans, it will be preserved.	0
ClaimBuster	20730	The key question that has to be answered in this election is will we use that prosperity wisely in a way that benefits all of our people and doesn't go just to the few.	0
ClaimBuster	24155	Number one, you make more making computer chips than potato chips; and, number 2, 19 out of 20 computer chips that we have in this country now come from Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	29051	It's an agenda that says we're listen to the young voices in Social Security and say we're going to think differently about making sure we have a system, but also fulfill the promise to the seniors in America.	0
ClaimBuster	29549	Why did she delete 33,000...	0
ClaimBuster	4378	We can't invest in science and technology, which will determine whether or not we are going to be competitive in the long term.	0
ClaimBuster	17403	I think that we've had something to do with that, just as we have with the drug problem nationwide.	0
ClaimBuster	32099	If you did that in the private sector, you'd be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	16519	I believe that we ought to have a balanced budget during normal economic circumstances.	0
ClaimBuster	27513	And I think that when the president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel, that they noticed that as well.	1
ClaimBuster	6460	And, as a result, America is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be.	0
ClaimBuster	11123	When you announce that you're going to launch an attack into another country, it's pretty obvious that you have the effect that it had in Pakistan: It turns public opinion against us.	0
